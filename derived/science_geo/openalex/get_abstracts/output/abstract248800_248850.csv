https://openalex.org/W2117719082,"The developmental origin of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) in the forebrain has been controversial. We now show, by Cre-lox fate mapping in transgenic mice, that the first OLPs originate in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and anterior entopeduncular area (AEP) in the ventral forebrain. From there, they populate the entire embryonic telencephalon including the cerebral cortex before being joined by a second wave of OLPs from the lateral and/or caudal ganglionic eminences (LGE and CGE). Finally, a third wave arises within the postnatal cortex. When any one population is destroyed at source by the targeted expression of diphtheria toxin, the remaining cells take over and the mice survive and behave normally, with a normal complement of oligodendrocytes and myelin. Thus, functionally redundant populations of OLPs compete for space in the developing brain. Notably, the embryonic MGE- and AEP-derived population is eliminated during postnatal life, raising questions about the nature and purpose of the competition."

https://openalex.org/W1980362959,"Understanding patterns of biodiversity distribution is essential to conservation strategies, but severe data constraints make surrogate measures necessary. For this reason, many studies have tested the performance of terrestrial vertebrates as surrogates for overall species diversity, but these tests have typically been limited to a single taxon or region. Here we show that global patterns of richness are highly correlated among amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, as are endemism patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrate that although the correlation between global richness and endemism is low, aggregate regions selected for high levels of endemism capture significantly more species than expected by chance. Although areas high in endemism have long been targeted for the protection of narrow-ranging species, our findings provide evidence that endemism is also a useful surrogate for the conservation of all terrestrial vertebrates."

Such excitotoxic brain lesions initially result in primary destruction of brain parenchyma, which attracts macrophages and microglia. These inflammatory cells release toxic cytokines and free radicals, resulting in secondary neuronal damage. In this study, we show that the endocannabinoid system is highly activated during CNS inflammation and that the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) protects neurons from inflammatory damage by CB1/2 receptor-mediated rapid induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) in microglial cells associated with histone H3 phoshorylation of the mkp-1 gene sequence. As a result, AEA-induced rapid MKP-1 expression switches off MAPK signal transduction in microglial cells activated by stimulation of pattern recognition receptors. The release of AEA in injured CNS tissue might therefore represent a new mechanism of neuro-immune communication during CNS injury, which controls and limits immune response after primary CNS damage.

The endocannabinoid system, consisting of cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands, and enzymes for synthesis and degradation of endocannabinoids, is known to play a crucial role in neuronal signal transduction. Cannabinoid-sensitive sites inside the brain include the neuronal CB1 cannabinoid receptor (Matsuda et al., 1988Matsuda L.A. Lolait S.J. Brownstein M.J. Young A.C. Bronner T.I. Structure of a cannabinoid receptor in rat brain.Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 605-613PubMed Google Scholar) and its counterpart in the immune system, the CB2 receptor (Munro et al., 1993Munro S. Thomas K.L. Abu-Shaar M. Molecular characterization of a peripheral receptor for cannabinoids.Nature. 1993; 365: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (3889) Google Scholar). The endogenous ligands, the endocannabinoids, are made through cleavage of membrane precursors and are involved in various signaling processes. Whereas the metabolic pathways of anandamide (AEA), a small lipid molecule sharing structural features with the eicosanoids, are unique and release of the compound in the living brain occurs on demand (Di Marzo et al., 1994Di Marzo V.

During neuronal activity, the endogenous cannabinoid AEA is formed by glutamate receptor agonists in a Ca2+-dependent manner or by stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in a G-protein-coupled process (Giuffrida et al., 1999Giuffrida A.

In the neuronal network, endocannabinoids mediate a localized signaling mechanism through which principal neurons modify the strength of incoming synaptic inputs (Alger, 2002Alger B.E.

Endocannabinoid signaling in the brain.Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar): in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, membrane depolarization opens voltage-activated Ca2+ channels in pyramidal neurons and therefore stimulates the synthesis of 2-AG and AEA. The endocannabinoids then travel backward across the synapse to interact with CB1 receptors on axon terminals of GABAergic interneurons, leading to depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). Such retrograde signaling by endocannabinoid-mediated DSI occurs in the hippocampus but has also been shown outside the hippocampus at interneuron-principal cell synapses (Llano et al., 1991Llano I.

Such excitotoxic brain lesions initially result in primary destruction of brain parenchyma, which attracts macrophages and microglia, the major effector cells within the CNS. These inflammatory cells produce large amounts of toxic cytokines and oxygen radicals that subsequently result in secondary neuronal damage. Although it is known that the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are expressed on microglial cells (Carrier et al., 2004Carrier E.J. Kearn C.S. Barkmeier A.J. Breese N.M. Yang W. Nithipatikom K.

Witting A. Wade C. Xie Y. Kunos G. Mackie K. Stella N. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoid receptors regulate microglial cell migration.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the function of the endocannabinoid system within the CNS immune system has not been elucidated. In this study, we reveal a function of the endocannabinoid system not related to neurons but affecting nerve cell function and survival after brain injury. We show that the endocannabinoid system is highly activated during CNS inflammation and protects neurons from inflammatory damage by inducing a novel intracellular negative feedback loop in microglial cells acting via CB1/2-mediated epigenetic regulation of MKP-1 expression. To investigate whether the endocannabinoid system is activated during inflammation within the brain parenchyma, we first analyzed endocannabinoid concentrations in CNS tissue from inflammatory lesions of patients with active or silent multiple sclerosis (MS) and normal control patients by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Witting et al., 2004aWitting A. Weydt P. Hong S. Kliot M. Moller T. Stella N. Endocannabinoids accumulate in spinal cord of SODG93A transgenic mice.J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1555-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In inflammatory lesions of patients with active MS, we found a 3.7-fold higher concentration of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and a 1.9-fold higher concentration in lesions of patients with silent MS, in comparison to healthy controls (Figure 1A). Levels of other endocannabinoids, such as 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), were only slightly influenced (data not shown). Because damage to neuronal structures has only recently been suggested to be a key mechanism during the development of MS (Trapp et al., 1998Trapp B.D. Peterson J. Ransohoff R.M. Rudick R.A. Mork S. Bo L. Axonaltransection in the lesions of multiple sclerosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3314) Google Scholar, Hemmer et al., 2002Hemmer B. Archelos J.J. Hartung H.P. New concepts in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), we next addressed the question of whether the accumulation of AEA might be a direct consequence of neuronal damage or because of invading immune cells. Thus, we used an approach that allows the study of the effects of immunoeffector cell invasion into living organotypic brain tissue, the organotypic hippocampal slice culture system (OHSC) (Heppner et al., 1998Heppner F.L. Skutella T. Hailer N.P. Haas D. Nitsch R. Activated microglial cells migrate towards site of excitotoxic neuronal injury inside organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.Eur. J.

In this model, exogenously cultivated microglia migrate into OSHCs toward the site of neuronal injury (Heppner et al., 1998Heppner F.L. Skutella T. Hailer N.P. Haas D. Nitsch R. Activated microglial cells migrate towards site of excitotoxic neuronal injury inside organotypic hippocampal slice cultures.Eur. J.

Med. 2003; 198: 1729-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In living brain tissue, we detected a 2.8-fold increase in AEA concentration after induction of specific excitotoxic neuronal damage by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) that was potentiated up to a 13.2-fold increase after invasion of BV-2 microglial cells (Figure 1B). BV-2 microglial cells exhibit morphologic and functional features comparable to primary microglial cells (Diestel et al., 2003Diestel A. Aktas O. Hackel D. Häke I. Meier S. Raine C.S. Nitsch R. Zipp F. Ullrich O. Activation of microglial poly(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 by cholesterol breakdown products during neuroinflammation: a link between demyelination and neuronal damage.J. Exp.

Res. 1992; 31: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and did not induce AEA production in a resting state (Figure 1B). Because AEA accumulated in inflamed brain tissue, the question arises about its influence on inflammatory damage to neurons. To address this, we transferred BV-2 microglial cells onto excitotoxically damaged OHSCs from mice and quantified the damage in the neuronal cell layers (pyramidal cell layer of the cornu ammonis and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus) after 3 days (Ullrich et al., 2001Ullrich O. Diestel A. Eyüpoglu I.Y. Nitsch R. Regulation of microglial expression of integrins by poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1.Nat.

A simple in vitro model of ischemia based on hippocampal slice cultures and propidium iodide fluorescence.Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 4: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Figure 1C, incubation with NMDA resulted in primary neuronal damage that was potentiated by the invasion of microglial cells, resulting in severe secondary damage. Incubation with 2 μM AEA completely abolished inflammatory damage but not the primary excitotoxic damage (Figure 1C). Incubation with AEA alone did not increase neuronal damage (Figure 1C). In order to investigate whether this AEA-mediated protection occurred as a consequence of other mechanisms of neuronal cell damage, we subjected OHSCs to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) and assessed neuronal survival after 3 days of microglial invasion, as described above. Here, incubation with 2 μM AEA reduced neuronal damage to the level of OGD-induced primary damage (Figure 1D). Because we observed no direct protection of neurons by AEA, neither in the NMDA nor in the OGD model in OHSCs, we investigated the protection of primary neurons subjected to NMDA- or OGD-induced injury in isolated primary neurons by measurement of LDH activity (Figure 1E): 2 μM AEA was not capable of protecting primary neurons directly against NMDA, which was also the case after OGD (319.2 ± 36.5 U/ml LDH release 24 hr after OGD versus 359.2 ± 22.3 U/ml LDH release 24 hr after OGD + AEA). These data indicate that the endocannabinoid AEA protects neurons from inflammatory damage very efficiently, but not from direct injury resulting from excitotoxicity or oxygen-glucose deprivation. In order to investigate a possible protective role of the endogenous cannabinoid system during the development of inflammatory neuronal damage, we transferred BV-2 microglial cells onto the surface of NMDA-damaged OHSCs in the presence of 0.5 μM AM 251, a specific CB1 receptor antagonist, and 2 μM AM 630, a specific CB2 receptor antagonist, and assessed damage in the neuronal layers of the hippocampus after 3 days. In this experiment, cannabinoids were not added to the brain tissue, and only the activity of endogenously formed cannabinoids was addressed. To allow the detection of a possible further enhancement of inflammatory neuronal damage after cannabinoid receptor inhibition, we reduced the time of primary NMDA-damage (2 hr instead of 4 hr compared to Figure 1C), resulting in lower primary and secondary inflammatory neuronal damage (2.4-fold and 4.1-fold, respectively, Figure 2) as baseline. CB2 receptor inhibition elevated the extent of inflammatory damage by 40% (from 4.1-fold to 5.8-fold), whereas CB1 receptor inhibition had no effect (Figure 2). In conclusion, the endocannabinoid system protects neurons from inflammatory damage in a CB2 receptor-dependent manner. Interestingly, without primary neuronal damage, BV-2 microglial cells release only small amounts of nitric oxide (2.28 ± 0.14 μM without neuronal damage versus 15.62 ± 2.66 μM after neuronal damage) and affect neuronal viability only slightly (Figure 2). This means that microglial cells, although present in large amounts inside the living OHSC tissue, are obviously under strict control in a healthy brain enviroment. In contrast, after cannabinoid receptor inhibition, neuronal damage exacerbates to 3.6-fold after CB1 receptor inhibition and to 3.8-fold after CB2 receptor inhibition (Figure 2). Thus, activity on CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors suppresses microglial cell attack on healthy brain tissue and therefore prevents the CNS from endogenous inflammatory damage as a potential nondesired side effect of continuous immune surveillance. Conversely, downregulation of the endocannabinoid system might therefore result in a loss of control and an ongoing attack of microglial cells on neurons. In the next set of experiments, we examined the pathway that prevents invading immunoeffector cells from initiating severe inflammatory damage. For this, we investigated the release of proinflammatory cytokines in cultured BV-2 microglial cells and of the cytotoxic free radical nitric oxide (NO) after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which acts via CD14/TLR4. In these experiments, we revealed a distinct dose-dependent reduction of NO release by AEA (Figure 3A, left), and also by the CB1/2 agonist WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 3A, right), associated with suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) (Figure 3C). Moreover, release of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was delayed (381 ± 47 pg/ml with 2 μM AEA versus 1095 ± 254 pg/ml without AEA after 12 hr) but reached similar levels after 24 hr. In contrast, release of TNF-α was not impaired (data not shown). Excessive production of NO has been postulated to elicit immune-mediated neurodegenerative inflammatory processes and to cause brain injury (Mabuchi et al., 2000Mabuchi T. Kitagawa K. Ohtsuki T. Kuwabara K. Yagita Y. Yanagihara T. Hori M. Matsumoto M.

Jander S. Schroeter M. Inflammation and glial responses in ischemic brain lesions.Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 56: 149-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). To clarify whether the abrogated NO release was due to specific interaction between AEA and CB1/2 receptors, we incubated OHSCs infiltrated with microglia with the pharmacological antagonists AM251 to CB1 and AM630 to CB2 receptors. In these experiments, we showed that the abolished NO release at least partially returns after incubation with both antagonists and that CB2 blockade was more effective than CB1 blockade (Figure 3B). This was also supported by experiments with blocking antibodies against CB1 and CB2 receptors, which restored the NO release to 21.2 ± 0.9 μg/ml (anti-CB1) or 7.21 ± 0.34 μg/ml (anti-CB2), respectively. Therefore, we conclude that AEA is capable of suppressing NO release in microglial cells inside inflamed brain tissue via interactions with CB1/2 receptors. Next, we addressed the question of which signaling pathway might be responsible for suppressed microglia activation by LPS/AEA coincubation. Incubation with AEA alone caused Thr202/Thr204 phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) after 8 hr (Figure 4A) as a consequence of activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, as reported previously (Derkinderen et al., 2003Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. Regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by cannabinoids in hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS alone induced ERK-1/2 phosphorylation after 2 hr (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, in the presence of both stimuli (1 hr preincubation with AEA or WIN 55,212-2 followed by LPS stimulation), phosphorylation of ERK-1/2 was not potentiated or even sustained but was reduced (Figure 4B). In this case, as a result of 1 hr preincubation with AEA (Derkinderen et al., 2003Derkinderen P. Valjent E. Toutant M. Corvol J.C. Enslen H. Ledent C. Trzaskos J. Caboche J. Girault J.A. Regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase by cannabinoids in hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2371-2382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the initial ERK-1/2 phosphorylation disappeared completely after LPS stimulation. Therefore, we assume that anandamide sets microglial cells into a state of alert by rapid MAPK-phosphorylation, but prevents (over-)activation in the presence of a second stimulus. The phosphorylation state of ERK-1/2 is generally regulated by the balance of upstream kinases or phosphatases. But in contrast to the rapid phosphorylation of ERK kinase (MEK) in microglial cells after LPS treatment alone (Figure 4C), LPS treatment after preincubation and in the presence of AEA or WIN 55,212-2 reduced and delayed MEK phosphorylation (Figure 4C). Because the constant or enhanced MEK activation after LPS treatment in the presence of AEA or WIN 55,212-2 (Figure 4C) did not account for ERK-1/2 dephosphorylation (Figure 4B), we next focused on the regulation of ERK-1/2-dephosphorylating phosphatases by AEA. In these experiments, a rapid induction of mitogen-activated protein kinase-phosphatases-1 and -2 (MKP-1 and MKP-2) occurred within 1 hr of treatment WIN 55,212-2 and within 2 hr of treatment with AEA combined with LPS (Figure 5B): induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 protein expression occurred early after the onset of cannabinoid receptor stimulation. Here, we observed maximal induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 after 2 hr AEA treatment, whereas LPS resulted in MKP-1 induction after 12 hr and MKP-2 induction after 4 hr (Figure 5A). This time course indicated that MKP-1 and MKP-2 induction was a direct effect of CB1/2 stimulation rather than an indirect effect triggered by initial MAPK activation (Shapiro and Ahn, 1998Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Feedback regulation of Raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase kinases 1 and 2 by MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1).J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, incubation with Ro-318220, an inhibitior of MKP expression (Guo et al., 1998Guo Y.L. Kang B. Williamson J.R. Inhibition of the expression of mitogen activated protein phosphatase-1 potentiates apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha in rat mesangial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10362-10366Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), prevented ERK-1/2 dephosphorylation in cultured microglial cells costimulated with AEA/LPS (Figure 5C). These findings suggest a pivotal role of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in the regulation and control of inflammatory reactions within the CNS. Thus, we investigated whether invading microglial cells in inflammatory lesions in the CNS actually expressed MKP-1 and MKP-2 and analyzed brain tissue from patients with MS by double-fluorescence microscopy (Figure 6A). As shown in representative pictures in Figure 6A, we found expression of MKP-1 in cells of inflammatory brain lesions colocalized with Ox42-positive microglia in the presence of high AEA concentrations (Figure 1A) but much lower expression and lack of colocalization of MKP-2 with microglial cells. Thus, we conclude that MKP-1 is indeed expressed in microglia cells during CNS inflammation (Figure 6A) induced by high levels of the endocannabinoid AEA (Figure 1A). Because formation of inflammatory lesions (Figure 6A) depends strongly on cell migration and because cannabinoid-receptor stimulation increase microglia cell migration in vitro (Walter et al., 2003Walter L. Franklin A. Witting A. Wade C. Xie Y. Kunos G. Mackie K. Stella N. Nonpsychotropic cannabinoid receptors regulate microglial cell migration.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next tested whether CB1- or CB2-receptor activity is required for migration of microglial cells into the regions of neuronal injury in living brain slice cultures. We found that site-specific microglia migration is strongly disturbed in the presence of the CB1- and CB2-receptor antagonists AM251 and AM6"

For the paramyxoviruses, the fusion (F) protein catalyses this membrane merger and entry step, and it has been postulated that the F protein undergoes complex refolding during this process. Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre- and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein."
https://openalex.org/W2093301371,"Networks of GABAergic neurons are key elements in the generation of gamma oscillations in the brain. Computational studies suggested that the emergence of coherent oscillations requires hyperpolarizing inhibition. Here, we show that GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition in mature interneurons of the hippocampal dentate gyrus is shunting rather than hyperpolarizing. Unexpectedly, when shunting inhibition is incorporated into a structured interneuron network model with fast and strong synapses, coherent oscillations emerge. In comparison to hyperpolarizing inhibition, networks with shunting inhibition show several advantages. First, oscillations are generated with smaller tonic excitatory drive. Second, network frequencies are tuned to the gamma band. Finally, robustness against heterogeneity in the excitatory drive is markedly improved. In single interneurons, shunting inhibition shortens the interspike interval for low levels of drive but prolongs it for high levels, leading to homogenization of neuronal firing rates. Thus, shunting inhibition may confer increased robustness to gamma oscillations in the brain."

In order to choose which food to consume, it is necessary to maintain a predictive representation of the subjective value of the associated food stimulus. Here, we explore the neural mechanisms by which such predictive representations are learned through classical conditioning. Human subjects were scanned using fMRI while learning associations between arbitrary visual stimuli and subsequent delivery of one of five different food flavors. Using a temporal difference algorithm to model learning, we found predictive responses in the ventral midbrain and a part of ventral striatum (ventral putamen) that were related directly to subjects' actual behavioral preferences. These brain structures demonstrated divergent response profiles, with the ventral midbrain showing a linear response profile with preference, and the ventral striatum a bivalent response. These results provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying human preference behavior. Food preferences are acquired through experience and can exert strong influence on choice behavior.

These brain structures demonstrated divergent response profiles, with the ventral midbrain showing a linear response profile with preference, and the ventral striatum a bivalent response. These results provide insight into the neural mechanisms underlying human preference behavior. Choosing between different available foods reflects an elementary form of decision making likely to be of crucial adaptive significance in natural environments. Such decisions are governed in part by individual preferences that are in turn shaped by prior experience. In order to implement decisions about what foods to consume, it is necessary to be able to associate foods with cues in the environment that predict their likely occurrence. Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain learns and encodes preference predictions is important not only for understanding the neural mechanisms of decision making but also for deriving neural markers that predict subsequent preference behavior. A recent study reported cultural modulation of neural and behavioral responses to presentation of two drink brands, by presenting cues relating to brand logos prior to subsequent delivery of the associated drink stimuli (McClure et al., 2004McClure S.M.

Neural correlates of behavioral preference for culturally familiar drinks.Neuron. 2004; 44: 379-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These cues strongly influenced subjects' choice behavior, suggesting a powerful influence of prior learned predictions on actual choice behavior. A putative model for learning appetitive and aversive predictions is temporal difference learning (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R. A neural substrate of prediction and reward.Science. 1997; 275: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (5400) Google Scholar, Sutton and Barto, 1990Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Time derivative models of Pavlovian Reinforcement.in: Gabriel M. Moore J. Learning and Computational Neuroscience: Foundations of Adaptive Networks. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1990: 497-537Google Scholar). This method involves a prediction error signal that indicates discrepancies between successive predictions of future reward. According to this model, trial-by-trial learning is reflected by a shift in this prediction error signal from the time at which the reward is delivered back to the time at which the predictive cue is first presented. Neurophysiological studies in nonhuman primates indicate that phasic activity in dopamine neurons is a possible neural substrate for this prediction error signal (Hollerman and Schultz, 1998Hollerman J.R. Schultz W. Dopamine neurons report an error in the temporal prediction of reward during learning.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 304-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, Montague et al., 1996Montague P.R. Dayan P. Sejnowski T.J.

Predictive reward signal of dopamine neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Recent neuroimaging studies of appetitive learning indicate the presence of prediction error signals in prominent target structures of dopamine neurons, such as the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and ventral putamen) and orbitofrontal cortex (McClure et al., 2003McClure S.M.

Temporal difference models and reward-related learning in the human brain.Neuron. 2003; 38: 329-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Significant prediction error-related activity has also been observed in ventral striatum during aversive learning (Seymour et al., 2004Seymour B. O'Doherty J.P. Dayan P. Koltzenburg M. Jones A.K. Dolan R.J. Friston K.J. Frackowiak R.S. Temporal difference models describe higher-order learning in humans.Nature. 2004; 429: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). However, it is not yet clear whether predictive activity in these brain areas is directly related to subjects' actual preference behavior. A key test of the hypothesis that reward predictions underlie behavioral decisions would be to determine whether there is a direct link between neural activity encoding such reward predictions and actual behavioral preferences. To address this question, we determined subjects' preferences for five different food “flavors”: blackcurrant juice, melon juice, grapefruit juice, carrot juice, and a tasteless and odorless control solution. We determined overall preference ranks for each flavor by repeatedly presenting pairs of foods, incorporating all possible combinations of pairs, and recording their preferences on each occasion. Following this, we scanned subjects using fMRI in a Pavlovian conditioning procedure during which they were presented with five different arbitrary visual cues, each of which was reliably associated with the subsequent presentation (5 s later) of one of the five specific foods (Figure 1). We predicted that the (previously neutral) visual cues would come to acquire predictive values according to the subject-specific preferences of the food they predicted. Multiple behavioral measures were used to provide evidence for Pavlovian conditioning. We used an on-line measure of subjects' pupillary dilation during the anticipatory interval, after the cue had been delivered but before the juice was presented, to provide an index of learned anticipatory arousal. On each trial, the visual cues were presented on either the left or the right of a fixation cross, and we asked subjects to respond by using a key press to indicate on which side the cue had been presented (before the juice was delivered), enabling us to determine whether reaction times had been modulated by presentation of the cues associated with the most or least preferred food stimulus. We also obtained affective ratings for the visual cues before and after the experiment to determine whether subjects changed their affective evaluation of the visual stimuli as a function of the specific juice with which the stimulus had been associated. To establish whether reward-predicting responses in key brain structures relate to subjects' behavioral preferences, we used a temporal difference learning model to derive a reward-prediction signal that captures the transfer of activity back from the time of reward in the early trials to the time of presentation of the cue in the late trials (Montague et al., 1996Montague P.R. Dayan P. Sejnowski T.J. A framework for mesencephalic dopamine systems based on predictive Hebbian learning.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1936-1947PubMed Google Scholar, O'Doherty et al., 2003O'Doherty J.P.

Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences.Mach. Learn. 1988; 3: 9-44Google Scholar). We correlated this modeled signal with trial-by-trial fMRI data, separately for each cue-food association, and tested for brain regions in which predictive responses to the cues were modulated as a function of subjects' individual preferences. We tested for two types of response profile: activity in which the predictive response scaled linearly with preference (where the fMRI signal increases linearly with increasing preference), and activity which shows a bivalent response profile, with a maximal response to the cues associated with the most and least preferred foods compared to a cue associated with a middle ranked preferred food. We looked for significant effects in a number of key brain structures that have been implicated in reward and reward-related learning: the ventral striatum (incorporating the ventral putamen as well as the nucleus accumbens proper), the midbrain (in the vicinity of the dopaminergic nuclei), the amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (O'Doherty, 2004O'Doherty J.P. Reward representations and reward-related learning in the human brain: insights from neuroimaging.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). To test for significant differential effects in anticipatory pupil dilation following presentation of the cue stimuli as a function of preference, we performed a repeated-measures ANOVA with one factor preference (from most to least preferred), another factor experimental session (session 1 versus session 2), and another factor time within a trial (mean pupilometry responses were binned into five 1 s long epochs from the time of presentation of the cue up until immediately before delivery of the juice). We observed a significant preference × session × time interaction (F[8,80] = 21.6, p < 0.001), indicating a significant effect of cue preference on anticipatory pupil dilation, evident by the second block of trials. Post hoc analyses revealed that the most and least preferred trials were associated with a significant increase in anticipatory pupil dilation relative to the middle preferred trials (at p < 0.05). This provides evidence of increased arousal due to anticipation of the subsequent presentation of the most and least preferred stimuli (Figure 2A). (A) Trial averaged pupil dilation for the most, least, and middle preferred stimuli shown separately for both experimental sessions. Anticipatory pupil dilation responses were significantly greater to the cues associated with the most and least preferred stimuli than that to cue associated with the middle preferred stimuli by the second session. (B) Reaction times for the cues associated with the most and least preferred stimulus plotted for both experimental sessions. The data plotted are the average across subjects of the median reaction time for that cue in each individual subject. Error bars depict standard error of the mean. A significant difference in reaction times to these cues emerged by the second session. (C) Pleasantness ratings for the cues associated with the most and least preferred stimuli. By the second session, there was a significant difference in pleasantness ratings ascribed to the cues associated with the most and least preferred stimuli. We tested for differences in reaction times in responses made to the most and least preferred cues. A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA of median reaction times with one factor preference (Most versus Least Preferred) and the other factor experimental session (session 1 versus session 2) revealed a significant session × preference interaction (F[1,11] = 5.9, p < 0.05), indicating that responses to the cue associated with the most preferred stimulus were significantly faster than the cue associated with the least preferred stimulus by the second block of trials (Figure 2B). We next compared subjects' affective evaluations of the cue stimuli (using a pleasantness scale ranging from −10 [very unpleasant] to +10 [very pleasant]), before and after the experiment. We used a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with one factor preference (most and least preferred cues) and the other factor session (before and after). The interaction between preference and session approached significance at p < 0.05 (F[1,11] = 4.7, p = 0.052). A post hoc t test revealed that the ratings to the cue associated with the most preferred stimulus were significantly greater than that made to the least preferred stimulus by session 2 (t[11] = 2.4, p < 0.05). These results suggest that subjects moderated their affective evaluation of the least and most preferred cue stimuli as a function of conditioning. Ratings for the stimuli associated with the least preferred food went down across sessions, while ratings for the stimuli associated with most preferred went up, demonstrating the development of learning over the sessions (see Figure 2C). Our imaging data indicated that in one of our a priori regions of interest there was a response profile that showed a significant correlation with the predictive signal arising from the temporal difference model. Responses in this area scaled linearly with preference. The region we identified corresponds to the ventral midbrain, in the vicinity of one of the main sites of origin of dopaminergic ascending projection systems: the ventral tegmental area (Figures 3A–3C). The subject averaged parameter estimates (from the peak voxel at the group level) are shown in Figure 3D, illustrating the linear trend. To provide further validation of the linearity of the response, we extracted the fitted parameter estimates from the peak voxels in this region from each individual subject and performed a forward stepwise linear regression procedure to test for a significant linear trend in the data as a function of preference. In the stepwise procedure, we also included a more elaborate model incorporating a quadratic response profile (symmetrical around the middle-preferred food) in addition to the linear profile. This procedure found a significant linear trend in the data (F[1,63] = 20.4349; p < 0.001; r2 = 0.242), and the more elaborate model incorporating the quadratic response did not significantly account for any additional variance (at p < 0.05). These data are plotted in Figure 3E. Two outliers are present in the data, on account of the parameter estimates from one particular single subject (for the regressors corresponding to the most and second most preferred stimuli). When these outliers are removed, the linear fit is even more significant (F[1,62] = 22.726; p < 0.001; r2 = 0.271). Subject averaged percent signal change time-course plots from the ventral midbrain are shown in Figure 4C (alongside model-predicted time courses in Figures 4A and 4B), for each category of preferred stimulus (ranked from most to least preferred), separately for early (first six) and late (last six) trials of each trial type ranked according to preference (from most to least preferred). (A) Predictive responses in ventral midbrain in the vicinity of the VTA scaling as a linear function of behavioral preference. Predictive responses in this region emerged over the course of learning, responding initially to the food stimulus itself and then transferring back to the cue stimuli by the end of learning. The statistical threshold is set at p < 0.001, and results are shown superimposed on the average structural image across subjects. The activation peak is localized to the ventral border of the tegmentum, as illustrated by the black circle, but also extends further down the brainstem into the pons. The coordinates of the peak voxel are [0, −21, −30] ([x, y, z ] in MNI space) with the peak z = 4.21. The peak voxel remains significant at the p < 0.001 level, even after adjusting p values to account for multiple analyses run with different learning rates (adjusted p value of peak voxel = 6.6481 × 10−5). (B) To better illustrate the precise localization of the activation peak, a plot of the same activation is shown using a more stringent threshold (set at p < 0.0001) overlaid on the mean normalized EPI image (averaged across subjects). (C) Illustration of VTA activity from three individual subjects overlayed on each subjects' individual mean EPI image. The threshold is set at p < 0.01, uncorrected. (D) Fitted parameter estimates for the temporal difference learning signal are shown from the peak voxel at the group random effects level for each trial type in the order of most to least preferred. Error bars depict standard error of the mean. (D) Plots of parameter estimates for the temporal difference learning signal from each individual subject in ventral midbrain shown for each of the trial types (ranked in order of preference from most to least preferred). The solid black line depicts a fitted linear regression slope indicating a significant linear trend in the data as a function of preference (r2 = 0.242; p < 0.001). (A) Model-predicted time course plots of the average evoked hemodynamic response during early (trials 1 to 6) and late (trials 24 to 30) trials for each cue-juice pairing (ranked in order from most to least preferred). The model-predicted response of each trial is convolved with a canonical hemoydnamic response function and then averaged across trials. The response for each trial type is shown scaled according to preference (assuming a perfect linear response as a function of preference). (B) Model-predicted time course plot shown after mean-correction to simulate the fact that due to only a small number of baseline events in the present experiment (1/6 of the total), the evoked hemodynamic response does not return to baseline but instead oscillates around a mean level of activity over all the trials. (C) Percent signal change subject averaged time course plots shown for each trial type, presented in order of preference of the associated flavor stimulus (from most to least preferred). The time course is shown separately for early (in black; trials 1 to 6) and late trials (in red; trials 24 to 30). The time course is extracted from the peak voxel in ventral midbrain (of the linear preference contrast) for each individual subject and then averaged across subjects. Error bars reflect the standard error across subjects. This observed time course shows some correspondence to the model-predicted time courses for the early and late trials (after mean correction), indicating that the observed fMRI signal reflects a linear change as a function of preference around a mean activity level in this region. No other regions of interest showed significant activity at p < 0.001, but linear correlations with preference were found in left amygdala (−18, −3, −24; z = 2.96; p < 0.002) and in medial orbitofrontal cortex (0, 30, −18; z = 2.79; p < 0.005) just below the threshold for significance. We report these results for completeness but do not discuss them further, as they did not reach our significance criterion. Even though we used imaging techniques designed to recover signal in areas with dropout such as orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal lobes, we cannot rule out the possibility that signal dropout in regions such as orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala contributed to the weak effects in these regions. In addition to the analysis performed with preference rankings, we also conducted an analysis in which we tested for brain regions in which predictive signals from the temporal difference model scaled according to the averaged pleasantness ratings for each of the juice stimuli. This analysis yielded a similar pattern of activity in the midbrain to that obtained with preference rankings but at a much lower significance level (which did not meet the criteria for significance at p < 0.001). No other areas of interest showed significant effects in this analysis. We also tested for regions that significantly correlated with a bivalent response profile (responding to the cues associated with the most and least preferred compared to the middle preferred stimulus). One region of interest showed a strong bivalent response: the ventral striatum, bilaterally (Figures 5A and 5B). Subject averaged responses in the ventral striatum are shown in Figure 5C. In order to determine whether the striatum was demonstrating a quadratic response as a function of preference or else an absolute valued linear response (i.e., scaling linearly both with increasing preference and also with decreasing preference relative to the middle preferred stimulus), we extracted the parameter estimates from the peak voxel in each individual subject and performed a forward stepwise linear regression procedure, adding linear, quadratic, and absolute valued linear terms to the model in a stepwise fashion. Addition of the quadratic term provided a significantly better fit to the data than the linear term alone (F[1,62] = 24.3; p < 0.001; r2 = 0.278), indicating that a quadratic response profile was a good description of the data. Further inclusion of the orthogonalized component of the absolute valued regressor (to account for the additional variance explained by the absolute valued response over and above the quadratic response) produced a significantly better fit over the quadratic model alone (F[1,62] = 11.7; p < 0.005). This result indicates that according to our analysis the best description of the response profile in the ventral striatum is that it is demonstrating an absolute linear valued response as a function of preference anchored around the middle preferred stimulus (see Figure 5D). Subject averaged evoked BOLD signals in striatum are plotted in Figure 6C (alongside model-predicted time courses in Figures 6A and 6B), separately for early (first six) and late (last six) trials of each trial type ranked according to preference (from most to least preferred). (A) Predictive responses in ventral striatum as a quadratic function of behavioral preference. The threshold is set at p < 0.001, and results are shown superimposed on the average structural image across subjects. Coronal slices are shown through the ventral striatum at the given y coordinates (top left of each slice). The coordinates for the peak voxel in the right striatum are [24, 9, −15] with a peak z value = 4.33; and in the left striatum are [−30, 9, −12], peak z = 3.92. These areas survived small volume correction within two 10 mm spheres defined around coordinates derived from a previous study of temporal difference learning at p < 0.001, corrected, in right striatum and at p < 0.01, corrected, in left striatum (O'Doherty et al., 2004O'Doherty J.

Dissociable roles of ventral and dorsal striatum in instrumental conditioning.Science. 2004; 304: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). The peak voxel remains significant at the p < 0.001 level even after adjusting p values to account for multiple analyses run with different learning rates (adjusted p value of peak voxel = 3.6718 × 10−5). (B) Illustration of activity in ventral striatum from three individual subjects overlayed on each subject's individual structural image. The threshold is set at p < 0.01, uncorrected. (C) Fitted parameter estimates for the temporal difference learning signal from the group level peak voxel in the right ventral striatum indicating a bivalent response as a function of preference. Error bars depict standard error of the mean. (D) Parameter estimates for the temporal difference learning signal shown separately from the peak voxels in each individual subject (for the bivalent preference contrast), plotted as a function of preference (from most to least preferred). Stepwise linear regression revealed that a quadratic response profile showed a significant fit to the data (at p < 0.001; fitted quadratic response is shown as solid red line). However, significantly more variance was explained by an absolute valued linear response (significant at p < 0.005). This response profile is linear for both decreasing and increasing preference anchored around the middle preferred stimulus, and the fit of this response profile to the data is depicted in the figure as a solid black line. (A) Model-predicted time course plots of the average evoked hemodynamic response during early (trials 1 to 6) and late (trials 24 to 30) trials for each cue-juice pairing (ranked in order from most to least preferred). The model-predicted response of each trial is convolved with a canonical hemoydnamic response function and then averaged across trials. The response for each trial type is shown scaled according to preference (assuming a perfect V-shaped response as a function of preference). (B) Model-predicted time course plot shown after mean-correction to simulate the fact that due to only a small number of baseline events in the present experiment (1/6 of the total), the evoked hemodynamic response does not return to baseline but instead oscillates around a mean level of activity over all the trials. (C) Percent signal change subject averaged time course plots shown for each trial type (right panel), presented in order of preference of the associated flavor stimulus (from most to least preferred). The time course is shown separately for early (in black; trials 1 to 6) and late trials (in red; trials 24 to 30). The time course is extracted from the peak voxel in ventral striatum (for the bivalent preference contrast) of each individual subject and then averaged across subjects. Error bars reflect the standard error across subjects. A shift in the time to peak of the response is evident as a function of learning (by comparing early trials to late trials) for the most and least preferred trials compared to the middle preferred trials, as reflected in the similarity of the observed time course to the predicted time course after mean correction shown in (B). We also conducted an additional analysis in which we modeled responses at the time of presentation of the flavor stimuli. A comparison of the flavor stimuli compared to the baseline trial (in which no flavor stimulus was presented) revealed activity in primary gustatory cortex (in mid-anterior insula and adjoining frontal operculum; see Figure 7). Responses in this area did not show a significant effect of preference, as tested by a repeated-measures analysis of variance on the parameter estimates across subjects from the peak voxel in this region (F[4,48] = 0.541; p = 0.706). These results provide support to the suggestion that preference effects observed elsewhere are unrelated to the sensory properties of the stimuli. (A) Sagittal slice through right insular cortex (at X = +36), demonstrating significant flavor-related activation in the vicinity of primary gustatory cortex, located in the middle/anterior insula and adjacent frontal operculum. The threshold is set at p < 0.001, uncorrected. (B) Parameter estimates extracted from a peak voxel in dorsal mid-insula (at coordinates [36, −3, 6]; peak z = 6.15) ranked as a function of preference (from most to least preferred). Error bars depict standard error of the mean. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed no significant effect of preference in this region (even at p < 0.05). We show that neural responses to a predictive cue in two key human brain regions, ventral striatum and midbrain, reflect the subjective value of the associated food reward as indexed by behavioral preference. Moreover, such representations develop with learning, responding initially to the food stimulus itself, and then over the course of learning transferring back to the time of presentation of the predictive cue. We suggest that such value-weighted representations may play an important role in guiding action selection when subjects choose between actions that lead to different available awards. Activity in the ventral mid-brain scaled linearly with behavioral preference. Thus, the greater the activity in this area to a predictive cue, the more the associated food stimulus was preferred. While we also obtained multiple behavioral and physiological measures that discriminated in a relatively crude manner between either most, least, or middle preferred items, such measures were not as sensitive an index of behavioral preference as our fMRI data. This provides some support to the suggestion that brain imaging could be a more sensitive predictor of subsequent preference behavior than traditional psychophysiological or behavioral assays, at least at the group level (Wilkinson and Halligan, 2004Wilkinson D.

Choline deficiency during fetal development reduces proliferation and migration of neuronal precursor cells in the mouse fetal hippocampus and these changes are associated with modifications in the protein levels of some cell cycle regulators and early differentiation markers. We fed C57 BL/6 mouse dams diets deficient or normal in choline content from days 12 to 17 of pregnancy, and then collected fetal brains on embryonic day 17. Using laser-capture micro-dissection we harvested cells from the ventricular and subventricular zones of Ammon's horn and from the prime germinal zone of the dentate gyrus (hippocampus). In the ventricular and subventricular zones from the choline-deficient group, we observed increased protein levels for kinase-associated phosphatase (Kap) and for p15(INK4b) (two cell cycle inhibitors). In the dentate gyrus, we observed increased levels of calretinin (an early marker of neuronal differentiation). In fetal brain from mothers fed a choline-deficient diet, DNA global methylation was decreased in the ventricular and subventricular zones of Ammon's horn. We also observed decreased gene-specific DNA methylation of the gene (Cdkn3) that encodes for Kap, correlating with increased expression of this protein. This was not the case for p15(INK4b) or calretinin (Cdkn2b and Calb2, respectively). These data suggest that choline deficiency-induced changes in gene methylation could mediate the expression of a cell cycle regulator and thereby alter brain development."

https://openalex.org/W2133082302,"Summary Although mutations in the human gene ( DCX ) cause profound defects in cortical neuronal migration, a genetic deletion of Dcx in mice produces a milder defect. A second locus, doublecortin-like kinase ( Dclk ), encodes a protein with similar doublecortin domains and microtubule stabilization properties that may compensate for Dcx. Here, we generate a mouse with a Dclk mutation that causes no obvious migrational abnormalities but show that mice mutant for both Dcx and Dclk demonstrate perinatal lethality, disorganized neocortical layering, and profound hippocampal cytoarchitectural disorganization. Surprisingly, Dcx −/y ;Dclk − / − mutants have widespread axonal defects, affecting the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, subcortical fiber tracts, and internal capsule. Dcx/Dclk-deficient dissociated neurons show abnormal axon outgrowth and dendritic structure, with defects in axonal transport of synaptic vesicle proteins. Dcx and Dclk may directly or indirectly regulate microtubule-based vesicle transport, a process critical to both neuronal migration and axon outgrowth."

Humans with mutations show profound alterations in cortical lamination, whereas in mouse, RNAi-mediated knockdown but not germline knockout shows abnormal positioning of cortical neurons. Here, we report that the doublecortin-like kinase (Dclk) gene functions in a partially redundant pathway with Dcx in the formation of axonal projections across the midline and migration of cortical neurons. Dosage-dependent genetic effects were observed in both interhemispheric connectivity and migration of cortically and subcortically derived neurons. Surprisingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of either gene results in similar migration defects. These results indicate the Dcx microtubule-associated protein family is required for proper neuronal migration and axonal wiring."
https://openalex.org/W2129356785,"We observed sharp wave/ripples (SWR) during exploration within brief (<2.4 s) interruptions of or during theta oscillations. CA1 network responses of SWRs occurring during exploration (eSWR) and SWRs detected in waking immobility or sleep were similar. However, neuronal activity during eSWR was location dependent, and eSWR-related firing was stronger inside the place field than outside. The eSPW-related firing increase was stronger than the baseline increase inside compared to outside, suggesting a “supralinear” summation of eSWR and place-selective inputs. Pairs of cells with similar place fields and/or correlated firing during exploration showed stronger coactivation during eSWRs and subsequent sleep-SWRs. Sequential activation of place cells was not required for the reactivation of waking co-firing patterns; cell pairs with symmetrical cross-correlations still showed reactivated waking co-firing patterns during sleep-SWRs. We suggest that place-selective firing during eSWRs facilitates initial associations between cells with similar place fields that enable place-related ensemble patterns to recur during subsequent sleep-SWRs."

The neocortex is the final destination of sensory information and is the site where this information is processed and eventually integrated into several behavioral and cognitive functions. Cortical neurons process and transmit information by integrating their synaptic inputs and generating discrete trains of action potentials (APs) that can be precisely timed. Consistent spike trains in response to repetitive identical stimuli may be important in building a neuronal code based on spike timing (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995Mainen Z.F. Sejnowski T.J.

In vivo studies suggest that principal neocortical neurons fire in response to identical sensory stimuli with a large trial-to-trial variability (Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T.

Yet, neurons in other CNS areas such as thalamus and retina fire faithfully in response to repeated presentations of the same sensory stimulus (Reich et al., 1997Reich D.S. Victor J.D. Knight B.W.

In neocortical slices in vitro, identical step current injection stimulations produce very jittery firing in pyramidal neurons, but spike-timing precision is significantly improved when stimuli contain synaptic-like noise, mimicking the continuous synaptic bombardment that pyramidal neurons receive during dynamic sensory inputs (Mainen and Sejnowski, 1995Mainen Z.F.

Cortical structures such as hippocampus and neocortex undergo network oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency range during dynamic cognitive tasks and varying sensory stimulations, and it has been proposed that this oscillatory activity might be important in binding sensory information (McBain and Fisahn, 2001McBain C.J.

Cortical oscillations are believed to be generated and maintained by GABAergic interneurons, which synchronize the firing of large groups of pyramidal neurons (McBain and Fisahn, 2001McBain C.J.

Interneuron diversity series: Rhythm and mood in perisomatic inhibition.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).

Physiol. 2005; 562: 9-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), suggesting that they might possess intrinsic mechanisms that promote their spike timing and thus precision. We recently demonstrated that FS neocortical interneurons innervate themselves, generating robust GABAergic autaptic transmission (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). Autaptic transmission is selective for FS basket cells (Tamas et al., 1997bTamas G. Buhl E.H. Somogyi P. Massive autaptic self-innervation of GABAergic neurons in cat visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6352-6364PubMed Google Scholar, Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar) and results in a fast and reliable shunting inhibition, which is activated every time a FS cell fires an action potential (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). The tight temporal link between a spike and a closely following large GABAergic conductance makes autaptic transmission a very good candidate in controlling the timing of subsequent APs and thus eventually in modulating spike timing during a train. To address the role of autaptic transmission in regulating the precision of spike timing, we recorded from FS interneurons in acute brain slices of juvenile rats in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor blockers. This simplified preparation, in which autaptic transmission is kept intact but excitatory neurotransmission is abolished, provided a convenient means to examine the functional properties of autapses. We found that FS interneurons are characterized by highly precise AP timing, as compared to large pyramidal cells, and that GABAergic autaptic transmission plays a major role in improving the precision of spike times in FS cells. This was true also when elevated and variable spontaneous synaptic activity was included in the stimulation waveform. Moreover, we found that GABAergic feedback inhibition could act in a similar manner to autaptic transmission to enhance spiking precision in pyramidal neurons. Whole-cell current-clamp experiments were obtained in rat neocortical slices. Neurons were visualized by infrared videomicroscopy, and FS interneurons were identified as round multipolar cells without an apical dendrite. Current-clamp characterization showed typical high-frequency firing (frequency range: 40–86 Hz, n = 14) in response to depolarizing current steps (Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997Kawaguchi Y. Kubota Y. GABAergic cell subtypes and their synaptic connections in rat frontal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1997; 7: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar, Beierlein et al., 2003Beierlein M.

Major differences in inhibitory synaptic transmission onto two neocortical interneuron subclasses.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9664-9674PubMed Google Scholar). Pyramidal neurons were identified by their typical large soma size and the presence of a thick apical dendrite oriented toward the pial surface. Pyramidal neurons were characterized by lower firing frequency (range: 5–18 Hz, n = 12) and much broader action potential than FS interneurons. Under conditions of excitatory neurotransmission blockade, FS and pyramidal neurons were depolarized multiple times by identical near-threshold DC current injections, which yielded action potential trains in the frequency ranges mentioned above. Each cell type showed a nearly constant rate of firing during repeated trains (CV = 0.03 ± 0.003 versus 0.04 ± 0.004 FS versus pyramidal cells, n = 14 and 12, respectively; p > 0.05, independent t test). However, FS and pyramidal neurons showed a large difference in spike-timing precision across different stimulation trials. We quantified spike-timing precision as spike jitter, defined as the standard deviation of the ordinal spike times across multiple identical stimulation trials. Jitter increased progressively during the train in both FS and pyramidal neurons, yet FS cells showed a very high degree of precision compared to pyramidal neurons (Figures 1A–1C). For example, spike jitter was significantly higher in pyramidal neurons than FS cells at the first and fourth spike in the train (first spike jitter: 0.27 ± 0.03 versus 0.65 ± 0.11 ms, n = 14 and 10 FS and pyramidal cells, respectively; p < 0.01, independent t test; fourth spike jitter: 1.5 ± 0.2 versus 8.1 ± 1.1 ms, n = 14 and 10 FS and pyramidal cells, respectively; p < 0.001, independent t test; Figure 1D). As discussed below, the precision of spike timing increases with frequency, and thus the higher precision of FS cells may result from their faster output rate. To test this possibility, we examined spike timing in pyramidal neurons by using strong intracellular current injections that produced maximal firing without inducing spike inactivation. Under these conditions, pyramidal neurons could fire sustained action potentials at frequencies up to 33 Hz (mean: 30.6 ± 0.8 Hz, n = 5), yet the spike jitter (fourth spike: 2.5 ± 0.4 ms) remained higher than obtained with near-threshold firing (∼40 Hz) of FS neurons (p < 0.02, independent t test). To test the role of autaptic transmission in regulating spike timing in FS interneurons, we developed a dynamic-clamp experiment aimed at generating realistic artificial autaptic conductances, after blocking natural autaptic transmission pharmacologically. Several physiological properties of autapses have been reported, including latency, decay time, and magnitude (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). However, their short-term dynamics are not yet known. Hence, we characterized short-term plasticity during repetitive activation of autapses in FS interneurons. For these experiments, we used a high-chloride-containing intracellular solution to maximize detection of autaptic signals. We generated trains of brief depolarizations (0.4–1.0 ms to 0 mV from Vh = −70 mV), each triggering an AP and an autaptic response, at different frequencies (10, 30, 50, 60, and 100 Hz) and measured the time-dependent depression of the autaptic inhibitory synaptic currents (autIPSCs) during the train (Figures 2A and 2B). Chloride accumulation during autaptic train was ruled out as a contributing factor to autaptic depression because voltage-clamp experiments revealed that the time course of use-dependent depression for both autaptic and synaptic inhibition was unaffected by changes in holding potential that would have influenced the degree of intracellular Cl− load (data not shown, cf. Huguenard and Alger, 1986Huguenard J.R. Alger B.E. Whole-cell voltage-clamp study of the fading of GABA-activated currents in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1986; 56: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar). autIPSCs were found to undergo moderate depression even at frequencies as low as 10 Hz. This, together with their low failure rate (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar), indicates that FS cell autapses release GABA with high release probability. For each given frequency, normalized autIPSC peak amplitudes during a train were averaged across cells (n = 8). The resulting curves were fitted with exponential functions having decay time constants of 164, 46, 31, 25, and 7 ms at 10, 30, 50, 60, and 100 Hz, respectively (Figures 2B and 2D). Further, we determined that autIPSC recovery rate was 681 ms (n = 8; Figures 2C and 2D). Based on the known properties of autapses, including those of autIPSC short-term plasticity outlined above, we implemented dynamic-clamp autapses, which were triggered by actual action potentials evoked in recorded neurons. Dynamic-clamp autapses were then introduced in separate current-clamp experiments obtained with physiological level of [Cl]i. For these experiments, the artificial autaptic conductance had properties essentially the same as those recorded in voltage-clamp mode, i.e., an average peak conductance of 6 nS, a delay of 1 ms, and a decay time constant of 6.8 ms (see Figure S2A in the Supplemental Data available online; Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). A use-dependent decay of the artificial autaptic conductance was present (Figures S2B and S2C), with similar properties of those reported in Figure 2 and based on the approach of Fuhrmann et al., 2002bFuhrmann G. Segev I. Markram H. Tsodyks M. Coding of temporal information by activity-dependent synapses.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 140-148PubMed Google Scholar. We then tested whether autaptic transmission in FS interneurons was important in setting the spike timing during action potential trains. In current-clamp, FS interneurons received ten identical suprathreshold current injections while maintaining constant Vrest. In control conditions, FS interneurons generated highly faithful firing in response to identical DC stimulation. Indeed, action potentials occurred with little jitter across identical trials (Figure 3A). When autapses (and other inhibitory synapses) were blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist gabazine (10 μM), the same DC stimuli generated less precise firing, as indicated by highly jittery responses (Figure 3B). Then, in the continued presence of gabazine, dynamic-clamp autaptic transmission was specifically introduced as in Figure S2. Realistic artificial autaptic transmission restored precision of spike timing (Figure 3C), which was subsequently lost when the dynamic clamp was switched off (Figure 3D). As indicated earlier, spike jitter across different trials increased linearly during the train. Jitter slope (measured as jitter/time) over the first 10 to 15 spike latencies was then computed. Gabazine application increased jitter slope, an effect that was reversed by addition of dynamic-clamp autaptic transmission (Figure 3E). The gabazine-dependent effect on spike jitter was most prominent when neurons fired between 40 and 80 Hz, which is in the gamma-frequency range. Autaptic transmission did not show any notable effect on spike-timing precision at higher frequencies (>100 Hz; Figure S1). On average, jitter slope was 0.019 ± 0.001 versus 0.03 ± 0.004 control versus gabazine. Dynamic-clamp autaptic transmission reversibly decreased mean jitter slope to 0.015 ± 0.002 (Figure 3F; n = 14, RM-ANOVA with post hoc comparisons: p < 0.02 control versus gabazine; p < 0.001 gabazine versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs; p < 0.001 dynamic-clamp autIPSCs ON versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs OFF; p > 0.1 control versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs ON and flat DC gabazine versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs OFF). To test whether precisely timed feedback inhibition could play a general role in modulating spike timing, we recorded from large layer V pyramidal neurons and introduced artificial GABAergic autaptic transmission in this cell type, which normally does not possess GABAergic autapses and shows a low spike-timing precision. When exposed to identical DC current injections, pyramidal neurons responded with highly jittery responses, which were not affected by gabazine (Figures 4A and 4B), indicating that ongoing spontaneous GABAergic synaptic transmission plays a small role in pyramidal cell precision firing during repeated trains. When artificial GABAergic autapses were introduced via dynamic clamp, precision in pyramidal neurons markedly increased (Figure 4C), as had occurred in FS cells. Mean jitter slope was 0.02 ± 0.002 in control, 0.019 ± 0.004 in gabazine, 0.01 ± 0.002 with dynamic-clamp autIPSCs, and 0.016 ± 0.005 when dynamic clamp was switched off (Figure 4F, n = 6; RM-ANOVA, with post hoc comparisons: p > 0.4 control versus gabazine; p <0.02 gabazine versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs; p<0.03 dynamic-clamp autIPSCs ON versus dynamic-clamp autIPSCs OFF). Autaptic transmission in FS interneurons is a very robust and reliable source of feedback inhibition. Yet, during sustained firing it tends to dissipate (cf. Figure 2), likely due to use-dependent reduction in release probability. We have previously shown that autaptic transmission influences changes in firing rates during sustained stimuli (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we directly tested whether short-term dynamics of autaptic transmission during a train could affect spike frequency of FS interneurons. In control conditions, when spike trains were evoked by suprathreshold DC current injection, FS interneurons showed little or no spike-frequency adaptation, measured as the difference of instantaneous frequency between the first and the tenth spike interval in the train. When autaptic transmission was blocked by gabazine, firing frequency increased, especially in the first part of the train, in agreement with our previously published observation from perforated-patch experiments (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A. Huguenard J.R. Prince D.A. Functional autaptic neurotransmission in fast-spiking interneurons: a novel form of feedback inhibition in the neocortex.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 859-866PubMed Google Scholar). Spike-frequency adaptation increased in the presence of gabazine (mean difference between first and tenth instantaneous frequency, Δf = 7.4 ± 2.5 versus 14.4 ± 4.1 Hz, control versus gabazine; p < 0.01; RM-ANOVA with post hoc comparisons; n = 11; Figures 5A and 5B), but when dynamic-clamp autaptic transmission was introduced, adaptation was dramatically reduced (Δf = 1.04 ± 1.8 Hz; p < 0.001; Figures 5A and 5B). Increasing dynamic-clamp autaptic strength to 10 nS resulted in a switch from adapting to accelerating firing behavior (Δf = −4.6 ± 1.3 Hz; Figure 5C). To test whether short-term plasticity of autapses (e.g., Figure 2) was responsible for the anti-accomodating effect, we removed use-dependent depression of dynamic-clamp autIPSCs, which largely eliminated the effect on spike-frequency adaptation (Δf = 5.1 ± 2.7; Figure 5C). Finally, when dynamic clamp was switched off, FS interneurons again showed prominent adapting firing behavior (Δf = 14.7 ± 4.7 Hz; Figures 5A–5C). These data indicate that autaptic transmission strongly modulates spike-frequency adaptation in FS interneurons. In addition to the effects on spike-frequency adaptation, autaptic transmission might modulate the regularity of steady-state firing and thus contribute to precise FS spike timing. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed spike regularity in FS interneurons in control, in the presence of gabazine, and with computer-generated autaptic responses. In control conditions, steady-state action potential firing was regular, as spikes occurred precisely and did not substantially deviate from the regular spike-timing pattern calculated from their averaged steady-state frequency (vertical bars in Figure 6A). When autaptic transmission was blocked by gabazine, interspike intervals became more irregular, as action potentials often deviated from the theoretical regular spike timing calculated from their average steady-state frequency (Figures 6B and 6D). Dynamic-clamp autaptic conductance restored action potential regularity (Figure 6C). This autaptic-mediated effect on spike regularity was also evident as highly variable frequency-time plots in the presence of gabazine, in contrast to control and dynamic-clamp autIPSCs (Figure 6E). We quantified firing regularity within each action potential train by using a modified coefficient of variation of interspike intervals (CV2, see Experimental Procedures; Holt et al., 1996Holt G.R. Softky W.R. Koch C. Douglas R.J. Comparison of discharge variability in vitro and in vivo in cat visual cortex neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1806-1814PubMed Google Scholar). Compared to standard coefficient of variation (CV), CV2 is less sensitive to spike-rate variations such as those that occur during accommodating spike trains (Figure 5) and thus represents a more accurate estimate of the regularity of neuronal firing if the mean rate changes over time (Holt et al., 1996Holt G.R. Softky W.R. Koch C. Douglas R.J. Comparison of discharge variability in vitro and in vivo in cat visual cortex neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1806-1814PubMed Google Scholar). Higher values of CV2 indicate decreased spike regularity. We found that CV2 increased in the presence of gabazine (mean CV2: 0.04 ± 0.004 versus 0.05 ± 0.006, control versus gabazine; p < 0.05, RM-ANOVA with post hoc comparisons, n = 7) and that computer-generated autaptic transmission reversibly reduced CV2 (dynamic-clamp on: 0.03 ± 0.003, dynamic clamp off: 0.05 ± 0.06, p < 0.01). CV2 analysis performed on pyramidal neurons revealed that this cell type also fires more regularly in the presence of artificial GABAergic autaptic transmission (mean CV2: 0.045 ± 0.006 versus 0.033 ± 0.003 control versus dynamic clamp; p < 0.01 RM-ANOVA with post hoc comparisons, n = 6). As with jitter, gabazine alone did not produce a change in discharge regularity of pyramidal neuron firing (mean CV2 in gabazine: 0.046 ± 0.005, p > 0.3). We have previously shown that GABAergic autaptic transmission results in shunting inhibition when single spikes are triggered by brief depolarizations from resting membrane potential (Bacci et al., 2003aBacci A.

At glutamatergic synapses, the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT) fills vesicles with glutamate. While elevated VGLUT expression increases quantal size, the minimum number of transporters required to fill a vesicle is unknown. In Drosophila DVGLUT mutants, reduced transporter levels lead to a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of spontaneous quantal release with no change in quantal size. Quantal frequency is not limited by vesicle number or impaired exocytosis. This suggests that a single functional unit of transporter is both necessary and sufficient to fill a vesicle to completion and that vesicles without DVGLUT are empty. Consistent with the presence of empty vesicles, at dvglut mutant synapses synaptic vesicles are smaller, suggesting that vesicle filling and/or transporter level is an important determinant of vesicle size.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 6221-6234Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). What is not known, however, is how many transporters are necessary to fill a vesicle to normal levels. At glutamatergic synapses, vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) are necessary to fill vesicles—in the absence of VGLUT1, there are empty vesicles (Fremeau et al., 2004Fremeau Jr., R.T. Kam K. Qureshi T. Johnson J. Copenhagen D.R. Storm-Mathisen J. Chaudhry F.A. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7158-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, these studies are complicated by the presence of multiple VGLUT isoforms in vertebrates, with many cells coexpressing two VGLUT isoforms (Boulland et al., 2004Boulland J.-L. Qureshi T. Seal R.P. Rafiki A. Gunderson V. Bergersen L.H. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Edwards R.H. Storm-Mathisen J. Chaudhry F.A. Expression of the vesicular glutamate transporters during development indicates the widespread corelease of multiple neurotransmitters.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 480: 264-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, all known glutamatergic neurons express a single VGLUT gene, DVGLUT (Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W. Collins C.A. Gelfand M.V. Dant J. Brooks E.S. Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This simplified system allows us to vary the dose of the single, functional transporter at a synapse in vivo. There are two possible consequences of a reduction in DVGLUT levels. First, if multiple transporters were necessary to fill each vesicle, then a decrease in transporter dose would be expected to reduce mEJP amplitude. On the other hand, if a single transporter is sufficient to fill a vesicle, vesicles with functional transporter would be full and vesicles without transporter would be empty. Experimentally, this would be observed as a decrease in spontaneous mEJP frequency. The stoichiometry of a functional glutamate transporter is unknown, so our discussion of a single transporter encompasses as many molecules of VGLUT protein as are necessary to form an active transporter. We have generated mutants in the Drosophila VGLUT homolog that allow us to decrease the dose of transporter at the synapse. We observe no change in mEJP amplitude, but a dose-dependent decrease in mEJP frequency. This reduction in event frequency is neither due to a lack of vesicles near the release site nor to an inability of these vesicles to fuse efficiently. These results strongly suggest that one functional unit of DVGLUT is both necessary and sufficient to fill a vesicle to equilibrium glutamate levels and that vesicles without DVGLUT are empty. At these dvglut mutant synapses, the average synaptic vesicle is smaller, consistent with the presence of empty vesicles. These results suggest that the number of transporters that reside on a synaptic vesicle must be carefully regulated. To determine whether decreasing transporter levels reduce the amount of transmitter within a vesicle, we generated mutants that reduce the levels of DVGLUT protein at the synapse. Mutants were made by imprecise excision of a p-element 1.5 kb upstream of dvglut (see Experimental Procedures). In this study, we use three of these excision lines: a control line that does not disrupt the dvglut gene; the dvglut1 allele, which is a hypomorph that deletes 2.3 kb of dvglut and expresses low levels of DVGLUT protein (Figure 1A); and Df(2L)dvglut2, a larger deletion that is lethal and removes the dvglut coding region (see Experimental Procedures). To determine how these mutants affect DVGLUT abundance at synapses, we quantified anti-DVGLUT immunofluorescence at the glutamatergic larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Anti-DVGLUT immunofluorescence is reduced to approximately 70%, 20%, and 10% of control levels in Df(2L)dvglut2/+, dvglut1/dvglut1, and dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2 larvae, respectively (Figures 1B–1D, p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Hence, this series of dvglut mutant combinations allows us to assess the physiological response of the synapse to reduced doses of DVGLUT. If reducing the number of transporters on the vesicle reduced the ability of the vesicle to fill completely, we would expect a decrease in mEJP amplitude. On the other hand, if only one transporter is sufficient to fill a vesicle completely, decreasing the number of transporters should only affect the frequency, not the amplitude, of mEJPs. To test whether vesicular glutamate loading is altered in dvglut mutants, we recorded spontaneous vesicle fusion at the NMJ (Figures 2A and 2B). A dose-dependent reduction in mEJP frequency was observed without any reduction in mEJP amplitude (Figures 2C and 2D). This decrease in frequency is rescued by driving a dvglut cDNA transgene in motoneurons (Figure 2D). The dvglut1/dvglut1 hypomorph releases fewer than half as many detectable quanta as wild-type larvae, while a further reduction in DVGLUT levels in dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2 decreases the quantal frequency to about one-quarter of normal (Figure 2C). There is no significant difference in mEJP amplitude among the genotypes tested, except in larvae rescued by the overexpression of DVGLUT. These show a slight increase in quantal size that is consistent with the previously characterized overexpression phenotype (Figure 2C; Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W. Collins C.A. Gelfand M.V. Dant J. Brooks E.S. Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The decrease in mEJP frequency with no change in their amplitude in the dvglut hypomorph is consistent with the model that a single, functional vesicular transporter is sufficient to fill a synaptic vesicle. With reduced levels of DVGLUT, many vesicles do not contain a functional DVGLUT and are empty, while those vesicles that do include a functional transporter have a normal amount of glutamate. However, alternate explanations for the data are possible. Might the persistence of normal quantal amplitude reflect postsynaptic changes in response to glutamate or presynaptic filling by a second DVGLUT gene? Is the reduction in quantal frequency due to the presence of empty vesicles, or might there be defects in vesicle biogenesis or in the ability of partially full vesicles to fuse? We address and exclude these alternate explanations in the following sections. The lack of a change in mEJP amplitude in the mutants suggests that all detectable events result from the fusion of vesicles containing a normal number of transmitter molecules. Might, instead, the normal quantal size reflect a postsynaptic process that masks a decrease in transmitter content? We think this is unlikely for the following reasons. First, at this synapse, receptors are not saturated (Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W. Collins C.A. Gelfand M.V. Dant J. Brooks E.S. Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, Karunanithi et al., 2002Karunanithi S. Marin L. Wong K. Atwood H.L. Quantal size and variation determined by vesicle size in normal and mutant Drosophila glutamatergic synapses.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10267-10276PubMed Google Scholar), so a decrease in transmitter should result in a reduced quantal size. Such reductions in quantal size can be detected without concomitant decreases in mini frequency (Petersen et al., 1997Petersen S.A. Fetter R.D. Noordermeer J.N. Goodman C.S. DiAntonio A. Genetic analysis of glutamate receptors in Drosophila reveals a retrograde signal regulating presynaptic transmitter release.Neuron. 1997; 19: 1237-1248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Second, the distribution of mEJP amplitudes is not significantly different between wild-type and strong dvglut hypomorphs (Figure 2E, K-S test, p > 0.2), so if a postsynaptic homeostatic mechanism exists to keep quantal size constant, it would have to scale perfectly to wild-type amplitudes. Third, an increase in postsynaptic response to transmitter would result in both normal quantal size and frequency and thus is inconsistent with the data. Fourth, we detect no increase in glutamate receptor levels at the NMJ in the mutant and find that each release site is still apposed by a glutamate receptor punctum (data not shown). Fifth, we directly assayed the postsynaptic response to exogenously applied glutamate, a technique that assays both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors at the Drosophila NMJ, and found no increase in the dvglut1/Df mutant (−41.7 ± 2.6 nA [n = 8] in wt versus −31.2 ± 1.9 nA [n = 7] in mutants). Hence, the normal quantal size in the dvglut mutants cannot be due to an increase in postsynaptic sensitivity to transmitter. Might a second, unidentified DVGLUT protein fill vesicles in the dvglut mutant and thereby explain the normal quantal size? If so, then the release of glutamate-filled vesicles should persist in the absence of all DVGLUT protein. To test this possibility, we recorded from homozygous Df(2L)dvglut2 mutant embryos in which the entire DVGLUT gene is deleted. These animals die as paralyzed, late-stage embryos. No events were detected in the null (>30 min of recording from six embyros), while spontaneous miniature excitatory junctional currents (mEJCs) were abundant in wild-type (Figures 3A–3D). This defect is presynaptic because the response to pressure-ejected glutamate is not significantly different between wild-type and mutant muscles (Figures 3E and 3F). In addition, glutamate receptors cluster in the mutant, demonstrating that spontaneous vesicular glutamate release is not required for glutamate receptor clustering (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available online). The lack of glutamate-containing vesicle fusion in the dvglut null despite normal glutamate receptor function demonstrates that DVGLUT is the only vesicular glutamate transporter at the NMJ. Why is DVGLUT necessary to maintain mEJP frequency? The most obvious explanation is that it fills vesicles with glutamate, so decreasing DVGLUT levels would result in a mix of empty and full vesicles. However, two other possibilities exist: DVGLUT could be required for either vesicle biogenesis or for normal vesicle fusion. Supporting a role for VGLUT in vesicle biogenesis, mouse VGLUT1 knockout central synapses were found to have ∼50% fewer vesicles than in wild-type, although no change in the number of vesicles within 100 nm of the active zone was observed (Fremeau et al., 2004Fremeau Jr., R.T. Kam K. Qureshi T. Johnson J. Copenhagen D.R. Storm-Mathisen J. Chaudhry F.A. Nicoll R.A. Edwards R.H. Vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 target to functionally distinct synaptic release sites.Science. 2004; 304: 1815-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). To examine whether DVGLUT is required for vesicle biogenesis, we used electron microscopy to image the synapse and then counted the number of vesicles adjacent to the active zone at NMJs from wild-type and dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2 larvae. Vesicles are abundant at both wild-type and dvglut mutant NMJs (Figures 4A and 4B). Within the first 100 nm of the active zone, the dvglut mutant displays only a 14% reduction in vesicle number (24.4 ± 1.0 for wt [n = 43 AZs] versus 21.1 ± 1.2 for dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2; Figure 4C, n = 39 AZs, p < 0.05). Even at 300 nm from the active zone, the reduction is less than 20% in the mutant (61.6 ± 2.6 for wt [n = 43 AZs] versus 49.6 ± 3.1 for dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2 [n = 39 AZs], p < 0.01, data not shown). However, this small decrease in the number of vesicles close to release sites is unlikely to account for the 4-fold reduction in mEJP frequency. Because vesicles are abundant, it is likely that many are empty. We previously demonstrated that overexpressing DVGLUT increases synaptic vesicle size (Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W. Collins C.A. Gelfand M.V. Dant J. Brooks E.S. Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, we concluded that either vesicle filling or levels of DVGLUT protein regulate vesicle size. If this hypothesis were correct, we would predict synaptic vesicles to be smaller in the dvglut mutants. We measured the size of synaptic vesicles and found that vesicles are indeed smaller in dvglut1/Df(2L)dvglut2 synapses than in controls. Average vesicle outer diameter is 39.1 ± 0.1 nm in the wild-type and 36.3 ± 0.1 nm in the mutant (p < 0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, n = 1840 for each genotype, Figures 4D and 4E). This corresponds to a 32% decrease in average vesicle volume. Because of the broad distribution of vesicle diameters even in wild-type, we are unable to resolve individual peaks for empty and full vesicles in the mutant. However, because the physiology demonstrates that full vesicles are present at the synapse, the actual empty vesicle size must be smaller than the average we observed in the mutant. Synaptic vesicles may be smaller either due to the absence of glutamate in the vesicle lumen or the lack of transporter in the vesicle membrane. Regardless of the mechanism, our results demonstrate that DVGLUT levels can affect synaptic vesicle size. Additional ultrastructural analysis revealed that average active zone length, percent of bouton circumference occupied by active zones (defined as sites of tight apposition of electron-dense membranes), and number of T-bars per active zone are unchanged compared to controls (data not shown). In addition, the number of synaptic boutons is not decreased in the mutant (data not shown). These results demonstrate that dvglut mutant synapses are grossly normal and that defects in active zone size and number do not explain the dramatic decrease in mEJP frequency. An alternate explanation for the decrease in mEJP frequency in dvglut mutants is that DVGLUT directly influences the ability of vesicles to fuse. All vesicles could be full but not efficiently released, or partially full vesicles may exist but be selectively unable to fuse. If this were the case, then the mutant would show defects in vesicle cycling as assayed by the fluorescent dye FM 1-43. No such defect was observed (Figures 5A1 and 5A2 and 5B1 and B2). The number of vesicles labeled and subsequently destained (the cycling pool size) was not significantly different between control and mutant larvae using either high K+ depolarization (Figure 5C, wt: 100% ± 21%, n = 12; dvglut1/Df: 91% ± 23%, n = 9) or nerve-evoked stimulation (Figure 5D, wt: 100% ± 23%, n = 9; dvglut1/Df: 95% ± 19%, n = 9). This result is consistent with optical measurement of synaptic vesicle cycling performed in cultured hippocampal neurons from mice lacking VGLUT1 in which vesicles cycle normally despite lower levels of transporter (Wojcik et al., 2004Wojcik S.M. Rhee J.S. Herzog E. Sigler A. Jahn R. Takamori S. Brose N. Rosenmund C. An essential role for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) in postnatal development and control of quantal size.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7158-7163Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that neither the fusion-competence of vesicles nor their availability limits the frequency of spontaneous events at this synapse. Optical measurements of nerve-evoked release contrast with electrical measurements of nerve-evoked release (Figures 5A3 and B3). The average nerve-evoked EJP amplitude is 27.9 ± 1.5 mV in wild-type (n = 12) compared to 10.4 ± 1.1 mV in dvglut1/Df larvae (Figure 5E, p << 0.01). Because the EJP amplitude reflects the fusion of glutamate-filled vesicles while the optical measurements reflect the fusion of all vesicles, the difference indicates the release of empty vesicles. These results are consistent with the decrease in mEJP frequency observed in the dvglut mutants. Because alternate explanations are not consistent with our data, we conclude that in dvglut mutants, vesicles are released at a similar rate as in wild-type, but a majority of these vesicles do not have functional glutamate transport and are therefore empty and electrically silent. If the reduction in DVGLUT levels results in many vesicles without any transporter, then most of the vesicles with transporter will likely have just a single functional unit. Because mEJP amplitude remains unchanged in the mutant, we conclude that a single unit of transporter is sufficient to fill a vesicle with normal levels of glutamate. A vesicle contains an estimated 20 to 40 unique proteins and only ∼800 protein molecules overall, so there is a modest number of copies of each protein on a vesicle (Fernández-Chacón and Südhof, 1999Fernández-Chacón R. Südhof T.C. Genetics of synaptic vesicle function: toward the complete functional anatomy of an organelle.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 753-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that a single functional unit of vesicular glutamate transporter is capable of filling a vesicle to normal levels. While one transporter is sufficient, how many transporters are usually present on a vesicle? Although we cannot provide a definitive answer, the data presented here in conjunction with our previous studies of DVGLUT overexpression suggest that one is a plausible number. When we decrease DVGLUT levels, there is no change in quantal size, and empty vesicles appear. When we increase DVGLUT, levels there is an increase in quantal size (Daniels et al., 2004Daniels R.W. Collins C.A. Gelfand M.V. Dant J. Brooks E.S. Krantz D.E. DiAntonio A. Increased expression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter leads to excess glutamate release and a compensatory decrease in quantal content.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10466-10474Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These results can be reconciled by the hypothesis that there is normally a single functional transporter on a vesicle. Increasing levels of VGLUT can add a second transporter and increase quantal size, while decreasing VGLUT levels results in a mix of vesicles that either retain the normal one transporter or have no transporter and are empty. These results have important implications for vesicle biogenesis and recycling. Mechanisms that sort transporters to synaptic vesicles must act with high fidelity to ensure that empty vesicles are rare and yet still be flexible enough to accommodate more transporters when they are overexpressed. Future studies will determine how VGLUT is trafficked to vesicles, how its copy number is controlled, and whether regulation of transporter number is a mechanism for modifying synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2096131894,"Hippocampal population discharges such as sharp waves, epileptiform firing, and GDPs recur at long and variable intervals. The mechanisms for their precise timing are not well understood. Here, we show that population bursts in the disinhibited CA3 region are initiated at a threshold level of population firing after recovery from a previous event. Each population discharge follows an active buildup period when synaptic traffic and cell firing increase to threshold levels. Single-cell firing can advance burst onset by increasing population firing to suprathreshold values. Population synchrony is suppressed when threshold frequencies cannot be reached due to reduced cellular excitability or synaptic efficacy. Reducing synaptic strength reveals partially synchronous population bursts that are curtailed by GABA(B)-mediated conductances. Excitatory glutamatergic transmission and delayed GABA(B)-mediated signals have opposing feedback effects on CA3 cell firing and so determine threshold behavior for population synchrony."

However, it is unclear how they convey protection; they often appear inactive when assayed under culture conditions applied to synthetic antibiotics. This inactivation has been associated with loss of function in physiological concentrations of NaCl or serum. In this study we show that the balance of host ionic conditions dictate microbial sensitivity to AMPs. Carbonate is identified as the critical ionic factor present in mammalian tissues that imparts the ability of AMPs such as cathelicidins and defensins to kill at physiological NaCl concentrations. After adapting to carbonate-containing solutions, global changes occur in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli structure and gene expression despite no change in growth rate. Our findings show that changes in cell wall thickness and Sigma factor B expression correspond to the increased susceptibility to the AMP LL-37. These observations provide new insight into the factors involved in enabling function of innate immune effector molecules, and suggest that discovery of new antimicrobials should specifically target pathogens as they exist in the host and not the distinctly different phenotype of bacteria grown in culture broth."

We show that this gradual transformation can be explained by a recurrent network process that effectively compares parts signals across neurons to generate inferences about multipart shape configurations. In primate visual cortex, object shape information is processed in the ventral pathway, a hierarchical network of areas in the occipital and temporal lobes (Ungerleider and Mishkin, 1982Ungerleider L.G. Mishkin M. Two cortical visual systems.in: Ingle D.G. Goodale M.A. Mansfield R.J.Q. Analysis of Visual Behavior. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1982: 549-586Google Scholar). At earlier processing stages in the ventral pathway (V1, V2, and V4), objects are represented in terms of their constituent parts. Individual neurons signal simple properties of local edge fragments (e.g., position, orientation, curvature) (Gallant et al., 1993Gallant J.L. Braun J. Van Essen D.C.

In contrast, at the final processing stages in anterior IT, individual neurons show nonlinear selectivity for global object shape, and objects are encoded by a sparser pattern of active neurons (Baker et al., 2002Baker C.I.

However, the neural transformation from distributed parts coding in V1, V2, and V4 to sparse global shape coding in anterior IT is not yet understood at a mechanistic level. Theoretical models suggest two basic alternative mechanisms for synthesizing parts information into global shape representations. One possibility is selective feedforward convergence, as in Hubel and Wiesel's model of V1 orientation tuning based on patterned summation of thalamic inputs (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962Hubel D.H. Wiesel T.N. Receptive fields, binocular interaction and functional architecture in the cat's visual cortex.J. Physiol. 1962; 160: 106-154PubMed Google Scholar). Feedforward models of object recognition depend critically on some kind of nonlinearity in the summation mechanism at each hierarchical processing stage (Riesenhuber and Poggio, 1999Riesenhuber M. Poggio T. Hierarchical models of object recognition in cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 1019-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Purely feedforward summation of parts information would facilitate rapid object recognition (Thorpe et al., 1996Thorpe S. Fize D. Marlot C. Speed of processing in the human visual system.Nature. 1996; 381: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The alternative is that recurrent processing within each hierarchical stage may iteratively refine feedforward stimulus signals that are initially weak or ambiguous (Chance et al., 1999Chance F.S. Nelson S.B. Abbott L.F. Complex cells as cortically amplified simple cells.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Douglas et al., 1995Douglas R.J. Koch C.

Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11956-11961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Although recurrent neural networks operate more slowly than feedforward networks, they provide a biologically plausible mechanism for generating the kind of nonlinear selectivity for element combinations (Salinas and Abbott, 1996Salinas E. Abbott L.F. A model of multiplicative neural responses in parietal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11956-11961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that global shape selectivity requires. Here, we distinguish between these alternatives by analyzing shape information dynamics in posterior IT (TEO and posterior TE), which mediates between distributed, parts-level coding in lower-level ventral pathway areas and sparse, global coding in anterior IT. We recently reported that neurons in posterior IT vary in the way they signal the presence of multiple contour parts (Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L. Connor C.E. Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For present purposes, we define “parts” to be contour fragments that can be described geometrically with single values for position, orientation, and curvature; e.g., the backward facing concavity at the trailing edge of a dolphin's dorsal fin. We define “multipart configurations” to be combinations of such contour fragments; e.g., the trailing edge concavity plus the leading edge convexity of a dolphin's dorsal fin. Thus, “configurations” would always contain more than one distinct position value and in most cases distinct orientation and curvature values as well. Obviously, the terms “parts” and “configurations” could be used in other senses; our conclusions are limited to the specific definitions given above. Some posterior IT cells show independent sensitivity to separate contour parts, i.e., the overall response is a linear function of the response components associated with each of those parts. Other neurons exhibit nonlinear selectivity for specific multipart configurations, i.e., the overall response is dominated by an interaction effect associated with the combined presence of two or more contour parts at specific positions. In the analyses presented here, we asked how these linear and nonlinear signals evolved through time after stimulus onset. We found that linear parts information emerged rapidly, whereas nonlinear signals for multipart configurations developed gradually, on a time course consistent with a recurrent network process for comparing parts information across neurons. We analyzed a sample of 89 posterior IT neurons recorded from two macaque monkeys. The monkeys performed a fixation task while stimuli were flashed in random order at the receptive field center. Example results are presented for a cell showing linear summation of information about separate parts (Figure 1A), a cell with nonlinear selectivity for multipart configurations (Figure 1B), and a cell with mixed linear/nonlinear response properties (Figure 1C). In each case, spiking responses to a large number of abstract shape stimuli were fitted with a model that characterized the cell's tuning for contour shape through time. The model was a combination of temporal response components representing either linear sensitivity to individual parts (blue histograms, right column) or nonlinear selectivity for multipart configurations (green histograms). These temporal response components reflected the evolving weights for Gaussian functions and combinations of Gaussian functions used to characterize smooth tuning for contour part curvature, orientation, and position (left column and Figures S1–S3). Example stimuli containing individual contour parts (blue) or multipart configurations (green) near the corresponding Gaussian tuning peaks are shown in the second column. The predicted (black line) and observed (gray histogram) average responses to these example stimulus sets are shown in the third column. The linear cell (Figure 1A) responded strongly to shapes containing either sharp (angle-like) concave curvature oriented toward the right (top row) or sharp concave curvature oriented toward the left (middle row). The combined effect of these two concavities (bottom row) was approximately additive (gray histograms, third column). Correspondingly, this cell's linear, single-part model components (blue histograms, right column) were large, and there was little additional weight in the nonlinear, multipart model component (green histogram). This kind of linear summation of information about separate parts produces inherently ambiguous outputs because a given spike rate can correspond to various combinations of single or multiple contour parts (see Figure S1). In contrast, the nonlinear cell (Figure 1B) was strongly selective for shapes containing a specific configuration of two parts: a broad concavity oriented near 200° and a broad concavity oriented near 315° (bottom row). Responses to shapes containing just one of these concavities were weak (top and middle rows). Responses to shapes containing both concavities were much stronger than the sum of the single-part responses. Correspondingly, the linear response components (blue histograms) were small, whereas the nonlinear component (green histogram) was large. Visual inspection of Figure 1B and the full stimulus set in Figure S2 reveals that strong responses were uniquely associated with this combination of concavities and not with any other single feature or combination of features. The strong nonlinear component associated with this configuration in the fitted model provides quantitative confirmation of this observation. Nonlinear responses like these convey explicit information about multipart shape configurations. The mixed response pattern in Figure 1C consisted initially of linear sensitivity to two types of contour parts but transitioned to nonlinear selectivity for the conjunction of those two parts. Thus, shapes containing either a broad concavity oriented near 315° (top row) or a broad concavity oriented near 135° (middle row) evoked transient responses. The response to shapes containing both types of concavities (bottom rows) included an early phase (100–200 ms poststimulus onset), approximately equal to the linear sum of these single-part responses, but also a later, sustained phase not predicted by the single-part responses. Correspondingly, the linear response components (blue histograms) consisted of transient peaks, whereas the nonlinear component (green histogram) had a delayed rise and a sustained profile. Neurons like these convey information that is initially ambiguous but then resolves into an explicit signal for a multipart configuration (see Figure S3). To visualize how linear single-part and nonlinear multipart information developed in time across the population, we separately summed each neuron's linear and nonlinear response components and plotted the results against time relative to stimulus onset (Figure 2A). Each cell is represented by a horizontal stripe in which brightness signifies total response strength and color signifies degree of nonlinearity (blue, linear; green, nonlinear; aqua, intermediate; see color scale bar). To clarify distinct trends in the population, we segregated cells into three categories according to whether their responses were predominantly linear (25 cells), predominantly nonlinear (15 cells), or mixed (49 cells; see y axis of inset scatter plot and Experimental Procedures). This classification is not meant to imply the existence of qualitatively distinct neural populations. Rather, our results are consistent with a continuous underlying distribution of response linearity and timing (see neural network simulation below). Within each category, cells are ordered according to response onset latency (white dots; see Experimental Procedures). Predominantly nonlinear cells responded at significantly (p = 0.008; randomization two-sample t test) longer latencies (mean ± SD: 112 ± 26 ms) than linear cells (93 ± 16 ms) and had delayed peak response times (181 ± 58 versus 146 ± 61 ms), although this trend fell slightly short of significance (p = 0.08). For mixed cells, linear responses predominated at earlier time points, and nonlinear responses were strongest at later time points: out of 34 mixed cells with a substantial change in response type over time (see x axis of inset scatter plot and Experimental Procedures), 79% (27/34; p = 0.0004; binomial test) had longer peak latencies for nonlinear as compared to linear response components, and across all 49 mixed cells, nonlinear response components were delayed by an average of 63 ms relative to linear components (p = 0.007; randomization paired t test). These trends at the single-cell level produced strikingly different temporal profiles for linear single-part and nonlinear multipart information averaged across the population (Figure 2B). Linear response strength, averaged across all 89 neurons (thick blue line), grew rapidly over the course of about 40 ms, reaching 90% maximum at 122 ms after stimulus onset. Nonlinear response strength (thick green line) grew more slowly over the course of about 100 ms, reaching 90% maximum at 184 ms after stimulus onset. The 62 ms peak offset between linear and nonlinear response components was highly significant (p < 0.0001; randomization test). A similar temporal difference was observed between mean linear and nonlinear response components (Figure 2C, thin blue and green lines, respectively) averaged across only those neurons that exhibited substantial transitions in response type (linear → nonlinear or nonlinear → linear responses) over time (cf. Figure 2A, blue and green symbols). This temporal difference was also present, but smaller in magnitude, between responses of predominantly linear and nonlinear neurons (Figure 2C, thick blue and green lines, respectively). These results suggest that both within- and between-cell temporal differences contribute to the population-level dynamics, but within-cell transitions from early linear to later nonlinear responses make a larger contribution. This large temporal lag between linear and nonlinear signals suggests a time-consuming network process that transforms feedforward signals to generate explicit tuning for multipart configurations. To illustrate how such a process might work, we simulated a neural network with a simple recurrent architecture based on previous models of nonlinear cortical processing (Chance et al., 1999Chance F.S. Nelson S.B. Abbott L.F. Complex cells as cortically amplified simple cells.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Salinas and Abbott, 1996Salinas E. Abbott L.F. A model of multiplicative neural responses in parietal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11956-11961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Each model unit received two feedforward inputs corresponding to a pair of contour part orientations (Figure 3A, blue arrows and tuning curves). The entire space of orientation pairs is represented by the 2D grid in Figure 3A. For simplicity, we simulated tuning for orientation only, though in reality, posterior IT neurons are tuned across multiple contour-related dimensions (Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L. Connor C.E. Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In addition, each model unit received recurrent connections from other units (green arrows and tuning curves). The recurrent connection weights had a difference-of-Gaussians (Mexican hat) pattern, such that each unit received excitatory inputs from units with similar tuning and inhibitory inputs from units with dissimilar tuning (Figure 3A, left). Each point on the 2D orientation-pair grid contained units ranging continuously from predominantly feedforward to predominantly recurrent connectivity (Figure 3A, right) (Chance et al., 1999Chance F.S. Nelson S.B. Abbott L.F. Complex cells as cortically amplified simple cells.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The time course of inputs to a model unit at the center of the tuning grid (i.e., tuned for concavities at 0° and 180°) with strong recurrent connectivity illustrates how nonlinear tuning for multipart configurations could arise and why it would be delayed (Figure 3B). The temporal profile of the feedforward input strength (blue arrows) was matched to the time course of linear responses observed in linear posterior IT neurons (Figure 2B, thick blue line). When stimulated by an optimal multipart configuration (Figure 3B, top row), excitatory recurrent input (bright green) to the example unit is initially weak (125 ms) but increases gradually to a peak near 225 ms because of mutually excitatory interactions between units near the center of the tuning grid. Thus, the delayed activity of these highly recurrent units represents an inference about the presence of multipart configurations based on implicit comparison of input information across neurons. In contrast, when these units are stimulated by a single part (Figure 3B, bottom row), excitatory recurrent inputs are recruited only weakly, and activity is suppressed by inhibitory recurrent inputs (dark green) from units with different tuning profiles. In this way, the information conveyed by recurrent neurons remains largely uncontaminated by single-part information. For these units with strong recurrent inputs (Figure 3B), the temporal response profile (Figure 3C) is thus dominated by nonlinear selectivity for multipart configurations (green), and this nonlinear response component has a slow rise and a delayed peak (near 200 ms). In contrast, model units with mixed recurrent/feedforward inputs exhibit a rapidly emerging linear sensitivity to individual parts (Figure 3D, blue) combined with a slowly rising nonlinear component (green). Model units with mainly feedforward inputs exhibit a rapidly emerging linear response component (Figure 3E, blue) with little nonlinear selectivity (green). These model response types parallel the neural response types exemplified in Figures 1A–1C. We separately summed linear and nonlinear response components across model units with the same procedures used in the neural analysis. This produced temporal profiles for linear and nonlinear information (Figure 3F) that paralleled the neural population activity (Figures 2B and 2C). The agreement between model and neural temporal profiles was robust across a reasonable range of model parameters (see Experimental Procedures). Thus, a relatively simple network architecture with continuous variation in relative feedforward/recurrent connection strength can explain the existence of delayed, nonlinear tuning for object part combinations in posterior IT. We conclude that explicit information about object part combinations is generated by recurrent processing of initially linear signals for individual parts. Our results show that in posterior IT, after stimulus onset, there is a gradual transformation from linear information about single object parts (simple contour fragments) to nonlinear information about multipart configurations. This transformation is due to a combination of tuning changes within cells (from linear to nonlinear) and gradual appearance of activity in cells with predominantly nonlinear tuning. The end result is explicit representation of multipart configurations and, thus, a more compact and efficient neural code for shape (Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L. Connor C.E. Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2004; 7: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our conclusions are limited, in a strict sense, to what we defined here as parts: simple contour fragments that could be described with single values for position, orientation, and curvature. However, the important principle is that information about simpler components appears rapidly, whereas information about configurations of multiple components evolves gradually. One could speculate that similar dynamic transformations occur for simpler parts at earlier processing stages and for more complex parts at later processing stages in the ventral pathway. Further transformation of this kind could produce the global shape sensitivity and extreme sparseness observed in anterior IT (Baker et al., 2002Baker C.I. Behrmann M. Olson C.R.

A sparse, explicit representation of complex shape configurations is easier to decode for purposes of object recognition and would maximize efficiency of memory storage and associative learning (Fiete et al., 2004Fiete I.R. Hahnloser R.H. Fee M.S. Seung H.S. Temporal sparseness of the premotor drive is important for rapid learning in a neural network model of birdsong.J.

The gradual emergence of configural information and gradual changes in single-neuron tuning reflect dynamic network processing of shape information, as opposed to a single feedforward pass through the ventral pathway. Recurrent processing could occur locally or could involve feedback from higher areas. However, many neurons exhibited nonlinear tuning at response onset, suggesting that feedback connections from higher-level areas—which are thought to modulate rather than establish neural selectivity (Bullier et al., 2001Bullier J.

Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 1991; 1: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (5138) Google Scholar)—do not play a primary role. Our network simulations demonstrated that local recurrent processing within IT could explain the observed time courses of linear and nonlinear shape information. Through recurrent processing, the network implicitly compares part information across neurons, in the sense that active neurons with similar tuning reinforce each other. Over the course of about 60 ms, this comparison process yields increasingly strong inferences about multipart configurations, represented by the growing activity of highly selective nonlinear neurons. The potential role of recurrent processing is also supported by other simulation studies showing that recurrent networks exhibit complex dynamics (Pugh et al., 2000Pugh M.C. Ringach D.L. Shapley R. Shelley M.J. Computational modeling of orientation tuning dynamics in monkey primary visual cortex.J. Comput. Neurosci. 2000; 8: 143-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and can produce nonlinear selectivity for conjunctions of inputs that are initially combined additively (Salinas and Abbott, 1996Salinas E. Abbott L.F. A model of multiplicative neural responses in parietal cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 11956-11961Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Fast reaction times in basic-level object categorization tasks (Thorpe et al., 1996Thorpe S. Fize D. Marlot C. Speed of processing in the human visual system.Nature. 1996; 381: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar) have been interpreted as evidence that object recognition relies primarily on feedforward processing. However, reaction times are virtually unaffected by manipulations known to degrade configural processing, suggesting that performance of these tasks depends mainly on detection of diagnostic parts (Rousselet et al., 2003Rousselet G.A. Mace M.J. Fabre-Thorpe M. Is it an animal? Is it a human face? Fast processing in upright and inverted natural scenes.J. Vis. 2003; 3: 440-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Rapidly emerging signals for individual parts (Figure 2B, blue lines) constitute a preliminary neural representation that could support this kind of early, nonconfigural categorization. In contrast, when object discrimination depends on specific part configurations, processing time is increased (by ∼30–50 ms relative to tasks involving differences in simple part shape) (Arguin and Saumier, 2000Arguin M.

As glutamate released by the photoreceptors depolarizes OFF cells and hyperpolarizes ON cells, the bipolars' antagonistic receptive field (RF) could be computed by simply integrating glutamatergic inputs from the RF center and GABAergic inputs from horizontal cells in the RF surround. Using ratiometric two-photon imaging of Clomeleon, a Cl(-) indicator transgenically expressed in ON bipolar cells, we found that dendritic [Cl(-)](i) exceeds somatic [Cl(-)](i) by up to 20 mM and that GABA application can lead to Cl(-) efflux (depolarization) in these dendrites. Blockers of Cl(-) transporters reduced the somatodendritic [Cl(-)](i) gradient. Hence, our results support the idea that ON bipolar cells employ a somatodendritic [Cl(-)](i) gradient to invert GABAergic horizontal cell input."

https://openalex.org/W1985425984,"The mechanisms controlling neurogenesis during brain development remain relatively unknown. Through a differential protein screen with developmental versus mature neural tissues, we identified a group of developmentally enriched microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) including doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK), a protein that shares high homology with doublecortin (DCX). DCLK, but not DCX, is highly expressed in regions of active neurogenesis in the neocortex and cerebellum. Through a dynein-dependent mechanism, DCLK regulates the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles and the proper transition from prometaphase to metaphase during mitosis. In cultured cortical neural progenitors, DCLK RNAi Lentivirus disrupts the structure of mitotic spindles and the progression of M phase, causing an increase of cell-cycle exit index and an ectopic commitment to a neuronal fate. Furthermore, both DCLK gain and loss of function in vivo specifically promote a neuronal identity in neural progenitors. These data provide evidence that DCLK controls mitotic division by regulating spindle formation and also determines the fate of neural progenitors during cortical neurogenesis.

In cultured cortical neural progenitors, DCLK RNAi Lentivirus disrupts the structure of mitotic spindles and the progression of M phase, causing an increase of cell-cycle exit index and an ectopic commitment to a neuronal fate. Furthermore, both DCLK gain and loss of function in vivo specifically promote a neuronal identity in neural progenitors. These data provide evidence that DCLK controls mitotic division by regulating spindle formation and also determines the fate of neural progenitors during cortical neurogenesis. The mammalian brain undergoes pronounced cytoarchitectural changes during development. Through mitotic division, neural progenitor cells give rise to lineages of neurons. These neurons then migrate, often over long distances, to their final positions (Caviness et al., 2003Caviness Jr., V.S. Goto T. Tarui T. Takahashi T. Bhide P.G. Nowakowski R.S.

Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Neuronal proliferation and migration are temporally and spatially coordinated to construct the distinctive structure of the central nervous system. For instance, the neocortex, which exhibits six layers of neurons, is built through precisely orchestrated waves of newly born neurons that migrate past their predecessors (Gupta et al., 2002Gupta A. Tsai L.H. Wynshaw-Boris A. Life is a journey: a genetic look at neocortical development.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 342-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). After migration, neuronal polarity is established upon the specification of the axon and dendrites (Horton and Ehlers, 2003Horton A.C. Ehlers M.D. Neuronal polarity and trafficking.Neuron. 2003; 40: 277-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), which is followed by elaborate axonal targeting, dendritic arborization, and synaptogenesis (Huber et al., 2003Huber A.B.

Diverse as they are, these morphological changes are executed through dynamic rearrangement of the cytoskeletal network components, such as microtubules and actin filaments (Baas, 1999Baas P.W.

Rev. 1990; 15: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The microtubule network undergoes drastic changes in neural cells at different developmental stages. For instance, during neural proliferation, microtubules assemble into the highly organized mitotic spindle upon the entry of mitosis (Ohnuma and Harris, 2002Ohnuma S. Harris W.A. Neurogenesis and the cell cycle.Neuron. 2002; 40: 199-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the orientation of the mitotic spindle may determine the mode of neural division (Haydar et al., 2003Haydar T.F. Ang Jr., E. Rakic P.

After the postmitotic neurons are generated, they extend a directional leading process and migrate toward their destination, the cortical plate. During migration, another specific microtubule network couples the centrosome and nucleus, resulting in the salient translocation of the nucleus (Shu et al., 2004Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z.

Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have been shown to be the direct regulators of microtubule dynamics during many of these developmental processes (Paglini et al., 2000Paglini G. Peris L.

Through genetic approaches, two genes responsible for human type I lissencephaly, LIS1 and DCX, were identified (Gleeson et al., 1998Gleeson J.G. Allen K.M. Fox J.W. Lamperti E.D. Berkovic S.

LIS1 and DCX are both MAPs that regulate microtubule dynamics in vitro and in vivo (Gleeson et al., 1999Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A.

Depletion of LIS1 or DCX by either a genetic or RNAi approach causes severe neuronal migration and positioning defects in the neocortex (Bai et al., 2003Bai J. Ramos R.L. Ackman J.B. Thomas A.M.

Genet. 1998; 19: 333-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Other studies further showed that LIS1 forms a complex with NudE-like protein 1 (Ndel1) and dynein, and this complex is implicated in orchestrating nucleokinesis during cortical neuronal migration by sustaining the microtubule network that couples the centrosome and nucleus (Shu et al., 2004Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In migrating cerebellar granule neurons, DCX also consolidates this microtubule network through the interaction with LIS1 and dynein (Tanaka et al., 2004aTanaka T. Serneo F.F. Higgins C. Gambello M.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Gleeson J.G. LIS1 and doublecortin function with dynein to mediate coupling of the nucleus to the centrosome in neuronal migration.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To identify MAPs with novel functions during brain development, we performed a differential protein screen on developmental and mature neural tissues. One of the most intriguing MAPs that we identified in our screen was doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK), a protein that shares 70% homology in the N-terminal domain with DCX. The C-terminal domain of DCLK, however, contains a kinase domain homologous to CaM kinase II (Burgess et al., 1999Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. KIAA0369, doublecortin-like kinase, is expressed during brain development.J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DCLK gene is extremely complex, and it has been reported that at least nine alternative products exist (Burgess and Reiner, 2000Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Doublecortin-like kinase is associated with microtubules in neuronal growth cones.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Burgess and Reiner, 2002Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Alternative splice variants of doublecortin-like kinase are differentially expressed and have different kinase activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17696-17705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the role of DCLK and provided evidence that DCLK regulates the structure and dynamics of the mitotic spindles and further controls neural division and fate determination during cortical development. To identify microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) with potentially novel functions during neural development, we performed a protein-based differential screen. MAPs were purified from postnatal day (P) 8 and adult (>8 weeks) cerebellum by a standard biochemical method (see Experimental Procedures). Cerebellum was chosen as the tissue source for MAPs purification because it undergoes dramatic morphological changes during early postnatal stages including active neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and differentiation (Goldowitz and Hamre, 1998Goldowitz D. Hamre K. The cells and molecules that make a cerebellum.Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, the cerebellum provides sufficient tissue mass for the large-scale protein purification. MAPs were purified from P8 and adult cerebellar lysates. Purified MAPs were resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel and counter-stained with Coomassie blue. Many protein bands were found to be preferentially present in MAPs from P8 cerebellum (indicated by arrows in Figure1A). These protein bands were dissected out and digested with trypsin for peptide fingerprint identification by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Among the identified proteins, two homologous proteins, doublecortin (DCX) and doublecortin-like kinase (DCLK) were found among the MAPs enriched on P8 (Figures 1A and 1B). DCLK was originally identified as KIAA0369 through a homologous comparison with DCX on its N terminus (Burgess et al., 1999Burgess H.A. Martinez S. Reiner O. KIAA0369, doublecortin-like kinase, is expressed during brain development.J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Like DCX, DCLK is able to polymerize microtubules in vitro, suggesting a role in regulating microtubule dynamics (Burgess and Reiner, 2000Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Doublecortin-like kinase is associated with microtubules in neuronal growth cones.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Lin et al., 2000Lin P.T. Gleeson J.G. Corbo J.C. Flanagan L. Walsh C.A. DCAMKL1 encodes a protein kinase with homology to doublecortin that regulates microtubule polymerization.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9152-9161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of DCLK during neural development, however, remains largely unknown. Western blots were performed with specific antibodies against DCLK and DCX to confirm the results of the differential screen. Both DCLK and DCX were found predominantly expressed in P8 cerebellum compared to adult. A significant portion of DCLK (about 50%) and DCX (about 25%) was associated with microtubules, suggesting an active shuffling of these proteins between a microtubule associated form and a cytosolic form (Figure 1C). This differential expression profile was specific to DCLK and DCX because none of Ndel1, LIS1, and dynein displayed a similar pattern (Figure 1C). The observation that DCX and DCLK are more highly associated with microtubules compared to motor-based MAPs suggests that DCX and DCLK may exert different but more robust functions in regulating microtubules during development. Immunostaining with an antibody generated against the C-terminal of DCLK showed that similar to DCX, DCLK was highly expressed in P8 cerebellum, including the external granule layer (EGL) (arrowheads in Figure 2A) and the internal granule layer (IGL) (arrows in Figure 2A). By contrast, the expression of DCLK and DCX were nearly absent in the adult cerebellum (Figure 2A). Although DCX was expressed in the inner zone of the EGL, DCLK was largely restricted to the outer zone, where dividing neural progenitors labeled with mitotic marker phosph-H3 were located (Figure 2B, the boxed areas were shown in high power). Immunolabeling of the postmitotic neurons with NeuN further showed an overlap with DCX in the inner zone of EGL (data not shown). Closer inspection of EGL progenitors with confocal z series further revealed that DCLK was expressed in the mitotic spindle (arrows in Figure 2C indicate a cell at prometaphase). In the developing neocortex, DCLK was also expressed in the active region of neurogenesis, the subventricular and ventricular zones (SVZ/VZ) (Figure 2D). Consistent with previous studies (Burgess and Reiner, 2002Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Alternative splice variants of doublecortin-like kinase are differentially expressed and have different kinase activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17696-17705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, Gleeson et al., 1999Gleeson J.G. Lin P.T. Flanagan L.A. Walsh C.A.

Gleeson J.G. Corbo J.C. Flanagan L. Walsh C.A. DCAMKL1 encodes a protein kinase with homology to doublecortin that regulates microtubule polymerization.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9152-9161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we found that throughout development (from E13 to E17), DCX expression was largely excluded from the SVZ/VZ in which phosphoH3-positive neural progenitors were located (Figure 2D). On E13, DCLK was found expressed in the marginal zone, cortical plate (CP), and the SVZ/VZ (Figure 2D; inset shows the migrating neurons in the CP). DCLK was expressed in radial glia labeled with an antibody against nestin (arrowheads in Figure 2E point to two cell bodies in the VZ). In dividing neural progenitors lining the surface of the ventricular wall, the expression of DCLK was associated with the mitotic spindle (arrows in Figure 2F point to a cell at metaphase). Similar observation is also made in dividing neural progenitors located in other regions such as the CP (Figure 2G shows a metaphase cell in the CP). On E15 and E17, expression of DCLK was high in the CP and the SVZ/VZ and relatively lower in the intermediate zone (IZ) (Figure 2D). We also examined the expression pattern of DCX and DCLK in cultured neural progenitors, which were isolated from E14 mouse cortices and maintained in a defined medium containing bFGF-2. Double immunostaining with Nestin showed that DCLK, but not DCX, was expressed throughout the cytoplasm in the neural progenitors (Figure S1). In cultured dividing neural progenitors, the expression of DCLK was also found associated closely with mitotic spindles (Figure S1). To directly test whether DCLK regulates the formation of mitotic spindles, we overexpressed EGFP-tagged wild-type DCLK in 293 HEK cells as a mean of gain of function. At interphase, DCLK gain of function dramatically induced microtubule polymerization, which formed pronounced ring-like structures (arrowhead in Figure 3A). Interestingly, at M phase, DCLK induced large monopolar mitotic spindles. These abnormal spindles usually extended several thick and rigid branches (arrow in Figure 3A), displaying striking differences from the stereotypical bipolar spindles in cells transfected with EGFP alone (Figure S2). Analysis of the mitotic index (the percentage of mitotic cells) showed no significant difference between control and DCLK gain of function, suggesting that the balance of M phase entry and exit was not disrupted (Figure 3B). However, an obvious abnormality was observed regarding the distribution of the mitotic cells overexpressing DCLK. Although control cells were distributed across all mitotic phases, including prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, cells with DCLK gain of function were mostly arrested at prometaphase (95% compared to 15% in control) (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition, we observed frequent occurrences of nuclear abnormalities such as meganuclei, double nuclei, and fragmented nuclei at interphase of cells overexpressing DCLK, which was likely the consequence of the M phase arrest (Figure 3C and data not shown). Next, we investigated which domain of DCLK was responsible for inducing the abnormal mitotic spindles and M phase arrest. Two natural splice variants of DCLK, the N terminus splicing form, doublecortin like (DCL; GenBank accession AF155821) and the C-terminal form, Candidate Plasticity Gene 16 (CPG16; GenBank accession AF155820) were used in these experiments (Burgess and Reiner, 2002Burgess H.A. Reiner O. Alternative splice variants of doublecortin-like kinase are differentially expressed and have different kinase activities.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17696-17705Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DCL contains the tandem microtubule binding domain (MBD) but not the kinase domain while CPG16 contains almost exclusively the kinase domain (Figure 3B). In addition, a previously reported DCLK kinase-dead form (K149R) was also included to test whether the kinase activity was required (Lin et al., 2000Lin P.T. Gleeson J.G. Corbo J.C. Flanagan L. Walsh C.A. DCAMKL1 encodes a protein kinase with homology to doublecortin that regulates microtubule polymerization.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9152-9161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to DCLK, overexpression of either DCL or DCLK kinase dead induced large monopolar mitotic spindle and caused a comparable arrest of M phase progression (72% and 77% of M phase cells were arrested at prometaphase, respectively) (Figures 3B and 3C). CPG16, however, exerted no effect on either the mitotic spindles or M phase progression (Figure 3A–3C). These experiments showed that the N terminus of DCLK with the tandem MTB domains is necessary and sufficient to disrupt normal spindle formation and to cause M phase arrest, whereas the kinase domain and/or the kinase activity are dispensable. To examine whether the formation of monopolar spindles is due to centrosomal abnormalities, we labeled the centrosome with RFP-centrinII. The centrosome in the interphase cells appeared normal when DCLK was overexpressed (Figure S3). At M phase, even though cells were arrested at prometaphase, two well-separated centrosomes were readily detected (arrows in Figure 3D), suggesting that the formation of monopolar spindles was not due to a centrosomal defect. Interestingly, the monopolar spindles induced by DCLK did not appear to originate from the centrosome, suggesting that DCLK is potentially capable of inducing mitotic spindle assembly independent of the centrosome (Figure 3D). To examine the effect of DCLK loss of function, we developed an RNA interference (RNAi) construct targeting the 3′UTR region of DCLK. This RNAi construct significantly reduced the expression levels of wild-type DCLK (Figure 4A). The specificity of the RNAi was further demonstrated by using a DCLK cDNA with two silent mutations within the targeted sequence. The forced expression of this mutant DCLK was not silenced by the RNAi construct (Figure 4A). Transfection of HEK293 cells with control RNAi did not affect the morphology of mitotic spindles (thin arrows in Figure 4B point to bipolar spindles at metaphase). In addition, the M phase progression was normal as mitotic cells proceeded through metaphase to telophase (Figures 4B–4D). By contrast, DCLK RNAi treatment induced an obvious disorganization of the mitotic spindles. In most cases, the mitotic spindles appeared significantly smaller because the spindle pole emanated much shorter and thinner microtubule branches (thick arrow in Figure 4B). At prometaphase, asymmetrical spindles with branches extending toward one pole were predominant (arrowhead in Figure 4B). Multiple spindles were also frequently observed (bottom in Figure 4B). As M phase progressed, these abnormal spindles did not separate or migrate to the two poles, and the bipolar spindles failed to form. Consequently, 79% of the mitotic cells were arrested at prometaphase (Figures 4C and 4D). In addition, a significant percentage of cells also displayed a wide range of nuclear abnormalities similar to those observed in DCLK gain-of-function experiments (Figure 4C and data not shown). As a microtubule-based motor, dynein complex has been shown to play important roles in microtubule network assembly and dynamics in both mitotic and postmitotic cells (Rusan et al., 2002Rusan N.M. Tulu U.S. Fagerstrom C. Wadsworth P. Reorganization of the microtubule array in prophase/prometaphase requires cytoplasmic dynein-dependent microtubule transport.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To test whether the function of DCLK to assemble microtubules is dependent on dynein activity, we inhibited dynein activity by using RNAi against dynein heavy chain (DHC) or Lis1, a positive regulator of dynein motor (Smith et al., 2000Smith D.S. Niethammer M. Ayala R. Zhou Y. Gambello M.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Tsai L.H. Regulation of cytoplasmic dynein behavior and microtubule organization by mammalian LIS1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2004Shu T. Ayala R. Nguyen M.D. Xie Z. Gleeson J.G. Tsai L.H. Ndel1 operates in a common pathway with LIS1 and cytoplasmic dynein to regulate cortical neuronal positioning.Neuron. 2004; 44: 263-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected with control, DHC, or LIS1 RNAi in conjunction with DsRed vector at a ration of 10:1. After 48 to 72 hr, cells were transfected with DCLK-EGFP vector. Cells were fixed 24 hr later for α-tubulin staining. In cells transfected with control RNAi, DCLK induced pronounced microtubule polymerization (Figure 5A). However, in a significant percentage of cells treated with DHC or LIS1 RNAi, DCLK failed to assemble microtubules (Figure 5A). Taxol, a compound that induces microtubule polymerization, is still capable of inducing microtubule assembly in cells treated with DHC or LIS1 RNAi, suggesting that the tubulin monomers in cells treated with LIS1 or DHC RNAi have the potential to polymerize; however, the function of DCLK to induce such polymerization is dependent upon Lis1 and dynein activity. To seek evidence of a physical interaction between DCLK and dynein, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. HEK293 cells were transfected with either FLAG-DCLK or control FLAG vector. Immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibody pulled down dynein intermediate chain (DIC) from cell lysates transfected with FLAG-DCLK but not control FLAG vector (Figure 5C). However, no significant amount of LIS1 was coimmunopreciptated with DCLK (Figure 5C). This result suggests that the function of DCLK to assemble microtubules may depend on its direct interaction with the dynein motor complex, which may play a role in shuttling DCLK from the cytosol to the microtubules. We next examined whether DCLK controls spindle formation and mitotic progression during proliferation of neural progenitors. To sufficiently silence DCLK gene expression in neural progenitors, we generated a DCLK RNAi lentiviral vector. DCLK RNAi hairpin sequence was subcloned into a lentiviral vector under the control of U6 promoter. This lentiviral vector also contains an EGFP transgene under a separate CMV promoter (see the schematic in Figure 6A). A lentiviral vector containing an efficient hairpin sequence against CD8, an irrelevant gene not expressed in neural progenitors, was used as a control. Both control and DCLK RNAi Lentivirus produced an average of 90%–95% transduction rate in cultured neural progenitor cells (Figure 6). We first examined the effect of the RNAi Lentivirus on mitotic progression 4 days after transduction. Neural progenitors infected with control Lentivirus were able to progress through M phase, with intact mitotic figures (Figures 6B and 6C). By contrast, 64% of neural progenitors infected with DCLK RNAi Lentivirus were arrested at prometaphase. The integrity of mitotic spindl"

https://openalex.org/W2073435945,"The Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) is a promiscuous chemokine receptor that binds to members of the CXC chemokine family possessing angiogenic properties. The DARC is expressed on erythrocytes and endothelial cells and is required for Plasmodium vivax infection of erythrocytes. Approximately 70% of African-Americans lack erythrocyte expression of the DARC as a genetic mechanism of protection against malaria infection. African-American men have a 60% greater incidence of prostate cancer and a 2-fold higher mortality rate than Caucasian men. Using a transgenic model of prostate cancer with DARC-deficient mice, we tested the hypothesis that lack of DARC expression on erythrocytes contributes to enhanced prostate tumor growth. In vitro, erythrocytes from wild-type mice but not DARC-deficient mice cleared angiogenic chemokines produced by prostate cancer cells and reduced endothelial cell chemotaxis. In vivo, tumors from DARC-deficient mice had higher intra-tumor concentrations of angiogenic chemokines, increased tumor vessel density, and greatly augmented prostate tumor growth. The data suggest that the DARC functions to clear angiogenic CXC chemokines from the prostate tumor microcirculation and that the lack of erythroid DARC, as occurs in the majority of African-Americans, may be a contributing factor to the increased mortality to prostate cancer in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2110103649,"Epidemiologic studies have shown that aging accounts significantly for the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED). The pathophysiology of ED during aging and its underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. We hypothesized that increased RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling is a major factor in the pathogenesis of age-associated ED and the mechanism involves increased penile smooth muscle contractility through inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase. Male Fischer 344 young (4 month old) and aged (20-22 month old) rats underwent erectile function testing in vivo by measuring intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) upon electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve. The data demonstrated that erectile function was significantly lower in aged rats than that in young rats at all voltages tested (P<0.05). Western blot analysis results showed that there were no significant changes in protein expressions of RhoA, Rho-kinase-alpha and -beta isoforms, and myosin light chain phosphatase target subunit (MYPT1); however, membrane-bound RhoA and phosphorylated MYPT1 were increased in aged rat penes by 95 +/- 15 and 56 +/- 8% (P<0.05), respectively, indicating enhanced RhoA and Rho-kinase activity. Inhibition of Rho-kinase with Y27632 maximally increased ICP/MAP to 0.72 +/- 0.05 in aged rats vs. 0.47 +/- 0.06 in young rats (P<0.05). Gene transfer of adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding dominant negative RhoA (T19NRhoA) to penes of aged and young rats for 7 days markedly improved erectile function in aged rats when compared with that in young rats (P<0.05). These observations were also supported by Rho-kinase activity assay results showing that basal Rho-kinase activity in aged rat penes receiving AAV vehicle treatment was twofold greater than that in young rat penes receiving AAV vehicle treatment, while it was reduced to a level similar to that in young rat penes after gene therapy of T19NRhoA (P<0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that impaired erectile function during the aging process involves increased RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling, and this pathway may be exploited for the treatment of age-associated ED."
https://openalex.org/W2040257251,"Kinesins are microtubule-based motor proteins that power intracellular transport. Most kinesin motors, exemplified by Kinesin-1, move towards the microtubule plus end, and the structural changes that govern this directional preference have been described. By contrast, the nature and timing of the structural changes underlying the minus-end-directed motility of Kinesin-14 motors (such as Drosophila Ncd) are less well understood. Using cryo-electron microscopy, here we demonstrate that a coiled-coil mechanical element of microtubule-bound Ncd rotates approximately 70 degrees towards the minus end upon ATP binding. Extending or shortening this coiled coil increases or decreases velocity, respectively, without affecting ATPase activity. An unusual Ncd mutant that lacks directional preference shows unstable nucleotide-dependent conformations of its coiled coil, underscoring the role of this mechanical element in motility. These results show that the force-producing conformational change in Ncd occurs on ATP binding, as in other kinesins, but involves the swing of a lever-arm mechanical element similar to that described for myosins."
https://openalex.org/W2086001245,"Keratinocytes migrate directionally into the wound bed to initiate re-epithelialization, necessary for wound closure and restoration of barrier function. They solely express the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2-AR) subtype of beta-ARs and can also synthesize beta-AR agonists generating a hormonal mediator network in the skin. Emerging studies from our laboratory demonstrate that beta-AR agonists decrease keratinocyte migration via a protein phosphatase (PP) 2A-dependent mechanism. Here we have extended our investigations to observe the effects of beta2-AR activation on keratinocyte polarization, migration, and ERK phosphorylation at the wound edge, cytoskeletal organization, phospho-ERK intracellular localization, proliferation, human skin wound re-epithelialization, wound-induced ERK phosphorylation, and murine skin wound healing. We demonstrate that in keratinocytes, beta2-AR activation is anti-motogenic and anti-mitogenic with both mechanisms being PP2A dependent. beta2-AR activation dramatically alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and prevents localization of phospho-ERK to the lamellipodial edge and its colocalization with vinculin. Finally, we demonstrate a beta2-AR-mediated delay in re-epithelialization and decrease in wound-induced epidermal ERK phosphorylation in human skin wounds and a delay in re-epithelialization in murine tail-clip wounds. Our work uncovers novel keratinocyte biology and a previously unrecognized role for the adrenergic hormonal mediator network in the wound repair process."
https://openalex.org/W2106031759,"The packaging of the eukaryotic genome into chromatin is likely to regulate all processes that occur on the DNA template. The assembly and disassembly of chromatin structures from histone proteins and DNA are mediated by histone chaperones, including the histone H3/H4 chaperone anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1). To address the function of ASF1 in metazoan cells, we used RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Drosophila melanogaster ASF1 (dASF1). Cells lacking dASF1 accumulate in S phase of the cell cycle as determined by flow cytometry analysis of DNA content and quantitation of the proportion of cells with replication foci. In agreement, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-chase analysis demonstrates that the absence of ASF1 leads to delayed progression through S-phase. Furthermore, the absence of ASF1 leads to a reduced ability to incorporate the nucleoside analog BrdU, indicating that ASF1 is required for efficient DNA replication. We have also found that dASF1 colocalizes with DNA replication foci throughout S phase by immunofluorescence analysis and that these dASF1 foci are disrupted upon inhibition of DNA replication by treatment of cells with hydroxyurea. As such, these results demonstrate that dASF1 is present at active, but not stalled, replication forks. We propose that dASF1 has a direct role in modifying chromatin structure during DNA replication and that this function of dASF1 is important for the processivity of the replication machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2136273681,"Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG), a matrix protein that occurs naturally in the central nervous system (CNS), is considered to be a major inhibitor of axonal regeneration and is known to participate in activation of the inflammatory response. The degradation of CSPG by a specific enzyme, chondroitinase ABC, promotes repair. We postulated that a disaccharidic degradation product of this glycoprotein (CSPG-DS), generated following such degradation, participates in the modulation of the inflammatory responses and can, therefore, promote recovery in immune-induced neuropathologies of the CNS, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). In these pathologies, the dramatic increase in T cells infiltrating the CNS is far in excess of the numbers needed for regular maintenance. Here, we show that CSPG-DS markedly alleviated the clinical symptoms of EAE and protected against the neuronal loss in EAU. The last effect was associated with a reduction in the numbers of infiltrating T cells and marked microglia activation. This is further supported by our in vitro results indicating that CSPG-DS attenuated T cell motility and decreased secretion of the cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Mechanistically, these effects are associated with an increase in SOCS-3 levels and a decrease in NF-kappaB. Our results point to a potential therapeutic modality, in which a compound derived from an endogenous CNS-resident molecule, known for its destructive role in CNS recovery, might be helpful in overcoming inflammation-induced neurodegenerative conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2058777300,"The green fluorescence protein (GFP) from the UBI-GFP/BL6 transgenic line was bred into C57BL/6J-scid and C.B-17-scid mice for investigating host-tumor cell interactions. These mice express high levels of GFP under the control of the ubiquitin promoter in virtually all cells examined. In tumor tissue generated by implanting tumor cells in the GFP transgenic SCID mice, the tumor cells and tumor-associated murine host cells were clearly distinguished by GFP expression. A population of cells expressing the endothelial cell marker VEGFR-2/Flk-1, and the progenitor markers c-Kit and Sca-1, were incorporated into tumor tissue. The majority of the Flk-1-positive cells were hematopoietic-derived cells that coexpressed CD45. To investigate the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells to the formation of tumor vessels and stroma, tumor cells were implanted in nontransgenic SCID mice that received a bone marrow transplant from GFP-expressing SCID mice. Although GFP-positive cells were readily detected by histology in tumors taken from bone marrow transplanted animals, they were spatially isolated and lacked organization. In contrast, if tumors were implanted in nontransgenic SCID mice adjacent to a patch of transplanted GFP-expressing skin, these tumors recruited GFP-positive cells that organized into tumor vessels. The results demonstrate that hematopoietic-derived cells, including Flk-1+/CD45+ cells, readily colonized the tumor stroma but were minimally incorporated in the tumor vasculature. The majority of the tumor vessels were instead recruited from tissue adjacent to the tumor. The expression of Flk-1 on nonendothelial, tumor-associated host cells raises the possibility that VEGF antagonists, such as Avastin, could inhibit tumor growth by a mechanism involving hematopoietic-derived CD45+/Flk-1+ cells, in addition to direct suppression of endothelial cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2132751411,"Osteoarthritis is characterized by a gradual degradation of extracellular matrix, resulting from an excess of chondrocyte cell death, mainly due to an increase in apoptotis. Recent studies have revealed the essential role of HSP70 in protecting cells from stressful stimuli. Therefore, overexpressing HSP70 in chondrocytes could represent a good strategy to prevent extracellular matrix destruction. To this end, we have developed a vector carrying HSP70/GFP, and transduced chondrocytes were thus more resistant to cell death induced by mono-iodoacetate (MIA). To overcome the barrier-effect of matrix, we investigated the efficacy of plasmid delivery by electroporation (EP) in rat patellar cartilage. Two days after EP, 50% of patellar chondrocytes were HSP/GFP+. After 3 months, long-term expression of transgene was only depicted in the deep layer (20-30% positive cells). HSP70 overexpression inhibited the natural endochondral ossification in the deep layer, thus leading to a lesser decrease in chondrocyte distribution. Moreover, overexpression of HSP70, after a preventive EP transfer in rat patella, was sufficient to decrease the severity of osteoarthritis-induced lesions, as demonstrated histologically and biochemically. In conclusion, intracellular overexpression of HSP70, through EP delivery, could protect chondrocytes from cellular injuries and thus might be a novel chondroprotective modality in rat OA."
https://openalex.org/W2109287916,"Microglia are the resident antigen-presenting cells within the central nervous system (CNS), and they serve immune-like functions in protecting the brain against injury and invading pathogens. By contrast, activated microglia can secrete numerous reactants that damage neurons. The pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with microglial activation, but the signaling pathways that program a neuronally protective or destructive phenotype in microglia are not known. To increase the understanding of microglial activation, microarray analysis was used to profile the transcriptome of BV-2 microglial cells after activation. Microglia were activated by lipopolysaccharide, the HIV neurotoxic protein TAT, and dopamine quinone, each of which has been linked to dopamine neuronal damage. We identified 210 of 9882 genes whose expression was differentially regulated by all activators (116 increased and 94 decreased in expression). Gene ontology analysis assigned up-regulated genes to a number of specific biological processes and molecular functions, including immune response, inflammation, and cytokine/chemokine activity. Genes down-regulated in expression contribute to conditions that are permissive of microglial migration, lowered adhesion to matrix, lessened phagocytosis, and reduction in receptors that oppose chemotaxis and inflammation. These results elaborate a broad profile of microglial genes whose expression is altered by conditions associated with both neurodegenerative diseases and microglial activation."
https://openalex.org/W2129777420,"Kainate receptors (KARs) have been shown to be involved in hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP); however, it is not known if KARs are involved in the induction or expression of long-term depression (LTD), the other major form of long-term synaptic plasticity. Here we describe LTD of KAR-mediated synaptic transmission (EPSCKA LTD) in perirhinal cortex layer II/III neurons that is distinct from LTD of AMPAR-mediated transmission, which also coexists at the same synapses. Induction of EPSCKA LTD requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ but is independent of NMDARs or T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; however, it requires synaptic activation of inwardly rectifying KARs and release of Ca2+ from stores. The synaptic KARs are regulated by tonically activated mGluR5, and expression of EPSCKA LTD occurs via a mechanism involving mGluR5, PKC, and PICK1 PDZ domain interactions. Thus, we describe the induction and expression mechanism of a form of synaptic plasticity, EPSCKA LTD.

KARs are a subfamily of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are known to be localized both pre- and postsynaptically at synapses in the mammalian central nervous system (Watkins and Evans, 1981Watkins J.C.

KARs are involved in synaptic transmission, both postsynaptically, where they mediate slow synaptic responses, and also presynaptically, by regulating glutamate or GABA release (Lerma, 2003Lerma J.

KARs are widely expressed in the mammalian brain and are implicated in neurological diseases such as epilepsy (e.g., Mulle et al., 1998Mulle C. Sailer A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H.

Recent studies have demonstrated that KARs are involved in long-term synaptic plasticity. In the hippocampus, KARs are important for the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses (Bortolotto et al., 1999Bortolotto Z.A. Clarke V.R. Delany C.M. Parry M.C.

Contrasting properties of two forms of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1995; 377: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). At thalamocortical synapses in the neonatal barrel cortex, LTP expression is associated with a reduction in the KAR-mediated component to transmission (Kidd and Isaac, 1999Kidd F.L. Isaac J.T.R. Developmental and activity-dependent regulation of kainate receptors at thalamocortical synapses.Nature. 1999; 400: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if KARs are involved in long-term depression (LTD), the other major form of activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the mammalian brain. Recent evidence suggests that mechanisms exist for the rapid differential regulation of AMPAR and KAR function by interacting proteins at the same population of synapses (Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Couthino V. Meyer G.

This provides the potential for the independent postsynaptic regulation of KARs, although whether this mechanism is involved in synaptic plasticity is not known. Here we have investigated KARs at synapses on layer II/III neurons in perirhinal cortex. We show that a form of LTD of the KAR-mediated EPSC (EPSCKA) can be induced that is independent of the previously characterized LTD of EPSCAMPA at the same inputs. LTD of EPSCKA has rather precise frequency requirements, being induced by 5 Hz afferent stimulation but not by 1 or 10 Hz stimulation. EPSCKA LTD requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ but is independent of NMDARs and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This form of LTD does, however, require KAR activation and is expressed via a mechanism involving mGluR5, PKC, and PICK1 PDZ domain interactions. Thus KAR-mediated synaptic transmission can undergo a form of LTD that is mechanistically distinct from the coexisting LTD of AMPAR-mediated transmission at these inputs. Kainate receptor-mediated EPSCs (EPSCKA) can be evoked in layer II/III neurons in perirhinal cortex slices using brief trains of high-frequency stimulation (five stimuli at 50 or 100 Hz) of the entorhinal input (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). Similar to EPSCKA evoked at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in hippocampus (Castillo et al., 1997Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Kainate receptors mediate a slow postsynaptic current in hippocampal CA3 neurons.Nature. 1997; 388: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, Vignes and Collingridge, 1997Vignes M. Collingridge G.L. The synaptic activation of kainate receptors.Nature. 1997; 388: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), the KAR-dependent component of the synaptic response can be isolated in the presence of the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (20 μM), the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP5 (50 μM), and the selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI53655 (50 μM) and is fully blocked by the nonselective AMPA receptor and KAR antagonist CNQX (25 μM). Thus, EPSCKA exhibits similar pharmacology to that previously reported at other synapses (Lerma et al., 2001Lerma J. Patermain A.V. Rodriguez-Moreno A. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Molecular physiology of kainate receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 971-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether activity can induce long-term synaptic plasticity of EPSCKA in two-pathway experiments in which a second control (temporal) input was also monitored (Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A novel form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We measured the fast AMPAR-mediated and the late slow KAR-mediated components of the dual component EPSC in the same cells. Two hundred afferent stimuli at 5 Hz (voltage clamp at −70 mV) applied to the test (entorhinal) input induced an LTD of EPSCKA (67% ± 4% of baseline, n = 10, Figure 1B) and of EPSCAMPA (63% ± 4% of baseline, n = 10, Figure 1C). This depression was input specific, since no LTD was observed in the nonconditioned temporal input. We next determined if LTD of EPSCKA could be observed in pharmacologically isolated KAR-mediated EPSCs. Thus, in another set of experiments, the LTD induction protocol was applied in the presence of 50 μM GYKI53655 and 50 μM AP5. Under these conditions, a robust LTD of EPSCKA was observed (67% ± 3%, n = 8, Figure 1D). This LTD was not associated with any change in the decay kinetics of EPSCKA (baseline = 137 ± 12 ms, LTD = 134 ± 13 ms, n = 8, p > 0.05). The ability to induce LTD in the pharmacologically isolated EPSCKA (in the presence of AP5) demonstrates that, unlike LTD of EPSCAMPA (Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A novel form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), this form of plasticity does not require NMDAR activation. The lack of NMDAR dependence for EPSCKA LTD suggests that this is a form of plasticity that is mechanistically distinct from the previously described LTD of EPSCAMPA at this input (Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A novel form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the two forms require different frequencies of stimulation for induction. An induction protocol of 200 stimuli at 1 Hz, a frequency that induces NMDAR-dependent LTD of EPSCAMPA at this input (63% ± 5%, n = 8; see also Cho et al., 2000Cho K. Kemp N. Noel J. Aggleton J.P. Brown M.W. Bashir Z.I. A novel form of long-term depression in the perirhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), failed to depress EPSCKA (95% ± 4%, n = 8 in EPSCKA, Figure 2A) in the same cells. Moreover, using the pharmacologically isolated EPSCKA, 1 Hz stimulation failed to induce LTD of EPSCKA (98% ± 4%, n = 6; Figure 2B), but, in the same neurons, 5 Hz stimulation induced robust LTD (75% ± 4%, n = 6). We also investigated higher frequencies for induction of EPSCKA LTD. Two hundred stimuli at 10 Hz failed to induce LTD of EPSCKA (101% ± 5%, n = 8, Figure 2C), although, in the same neurons, 5 Hz stimulation reliably induced LTD. Finally, we tested whether doubling the number of stimuli at 1 or 10 Hz could induce LTD; however, 400 stimuli at 1 or 10 Hz failed to induce any depression (Figure 2D). Thus, LTD of EPSCKA requires a restricted frequency of stimulation for induction (∼5 Hz) and is independent of LTD of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission. We next investigated the role of Ca2+ in EPSCKA LTD. Inclusion of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 mM) in the electrode solution blocked LTD of EPSCKA (94% ± 4%, n = 8, Figure 3A). To further determine the role of Ca2+ in LTD of EPSCKA, we tested the effects of reducing extracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]ex). Bathing slices in 1 mM [Ca2+]ex prevented the induction of LTD by 5 Hz stimulation (101% ± 9%, n = 8, Figure 3B); however, on returning to control levels of [Ca2+]ex (2 mM), the 5 Hz stimulation induced LTD in the same neurons (73% ± 7%, n = 8, Figure 3B). This suggests that Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane in the postsynaptic neuron is required for induction of EPSCKA LTD. Since NMDARs are not required for this form of LTD, we investigated other sources for the Ca2+ influx. We next determined the role of intracellular Ca2+ stores in EPSCKA LTD. Postsynaptic inclusion of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 2 μM), which depletes calcium stores, blocked LTD of EPSCKA (96% ± 7%, n = 6, Figure 3C). Previous work demonstrates that T-type Ca2+ channels are involved in one form of hippocampal LTD (Oliet et al., 1997Oliet S.H.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Two distinct forms of long-term depression coexist in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 1997; 18: 969-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). However, bath application of 100 μM Ni2+, which selectively blocks this channel type, had no effect on 5 Hz-induced LTD of EPSCKA (70% ± 7%, n = 7, Figure 3D). Since LTD of EPSCKA requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ but does not require NMDAR, T-type calcium channel, or AMPAR activation, we hypothesized that it may require KAR activation. Therefore, we used pharmacologically isolated EPSCKA (in the presence of picrotoxin, GYKI53655, AP5) and, following collection of a baseline, applied the nonselective AMPA and KAR antagonist CNQX (5 μM). A subsaturating dose that blocked EPSCKA by ∼60% was used so that a full recovery of the response could be achieved after 30 min of wash. This ∼60% block of EPSCKA fully prevented the induction of LTD (99% ± 8%, n = 7, Figure 4A), demonstrating that the EPSCKA LTD is sensitive to KAR blockade. We also performed a similar experiment using a subsaturating dose of the selective KAR antagonist, UBP296 (5 μM; More et al., 2004More J.C. Nistico R. Dolman N.P. Clarke V.R. Alt A.J. Ogden A.M. Buelens F.P. Troop H.M. Kelland E.E. Pilato F. et al.Characterisation of UBP296: a novel, potent and selective kainite receptor antagonist.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 46-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This compound also reversibly blocked EPSCKA and, like CNQX, prevented EPSCKA LTD (104% ± 11%, n = 7, Figure 4B). Thus, synaptic KAR activation is required for induction of this form of LTD. One possibility is that the KARs themselves gate the influx of Ca2+ required for the induction of LTD. In support of this, we found that EPSCKA exhibits an inwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship (Figure 4C) indicative of KARs containing unedited GluR5 and/or GluR6 that are permeable to Ca2+ (Chittajallu et al., 1999Chittajallu R.

Molecular physiology of kainate receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 971-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This, combined with our previous work showing that GluR5-containing KARs mediate Ca2+ influx in cultured perirhinal cortical neurons (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), strongly suggests that the primary source of Ca2+ for the induction of this form of LTD is from the synaptic KARs themselves. Previous work on perirhinal cortical neurons shows that mGluRs and PKC can regulate KAR function (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether these mechanisms are involved in LTD of KAR-mediated transmission. We first analyzed the effects of the mGluR5 selective antagonist MPEP. Bath application of MPEP (10 μM) caused a depression in EPSCKA (78% ± 6%, n = 6) that occluded subsequent LTD (93% ± 7%, n = 6; Figure 5A). This was selective for EPSCKA, since EPSCAMPA evoked either by single shock stimulation or by train stimulation was not depressed by MPEP (data not shown). The effect of MPEP indicates that synaptic KAR function is maintained by tonic mGluR5 activity and suggests that mGluR5 is tonically activated by ambient levels of glutamate in the slice. To test this latter idea, we investigated the effects of manipulating ambient levels of extracellular glutamate on EPSCKA and LTD. Bath application of the glutamate transport inhibitor DL-threo-b-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA; 5 μM; Shimamoto et al., 1998Shimamoto K. Lebrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. DL-threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartate, a potent blocker of excitatory amino acid transporters.Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), which raises ambient glutamate levels, caused an increase in EPSCKA amplitude (146% ± 9%, n = 8, Figure 5B) that was completely reversed by subsequent application of MPEP (89% ± 7%, n = 8). We also studied the effects of reducing extracellular ambient glutamate concentration using bath application of the enzymic glutamate scavenger system, GPT (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase; 5 units/ml) and pyruvate (2 mM; Overstreet et al., 1997Overstreet L.S. Pasternak J.F. Colley P.A. Slater N.T. Trommer B.L. Metabotropic glutamate receptor mediated long-term depression in developing hippocampus.Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, Min et al., 1998Min M.-Y.

Activation of AMPA, kainite, and metabotropic receptors at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses: role of glutamate diffusion.Neuron. 1998; 21: 561-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This had the opposite effect to TBOA, causing a depression of EPSCKA amplitude (82% ± 4% of baseline, n = 8, Figure 5C) that fully occluded with the effects of subsequent MPEP application (80% ± 3% of baseline, Figure 5C). In interleaved controls, however, application of pyruvate alone caused no depression in EPSCKA amplitude, and MPEP still reliably produced a depression of EPSCKA in its presence (80% ± 4% of baseline, n = 5, Figure 5D). These manipulations of ambient glutamate demonstrate that mGluR5 is tonically activated by glutamate under our recording conditions and, through this mechanism, regulates EPSCKA. These experiments were all performed at 28°C–30°C, and, since glutamate transport is a highly temperature sensitive process, we next investigated whether this tonic mGluR5-dependent regulation of EPSCKA occurs at close to physiological temperature. In experiments performed at 35°C, we found that LTD of EPSCKA could be reliably induced using the 5 Hz induction protocol (68% ± 4%, n = 7, Figure 5E) and, moreover, that MPEP reliably caused a depression of EPSCKA that occluded with LTD (77% ± 3%, n = 6, Figure 5F). We also tested the effects of bath application of TBOA at 35°C; this also caused an increase in EPSCKA amplitude (148% ± 13%, n = 8) that was completely reversed by subsequent application of MPEP (data not shown). Furthermore, consistent with the MPEP data, AIDA (1-aminoindan-1,5[RS]-dicarboxylic acid), another selective group I mGluR antagonist (Pellicciari et al., 1995Pellicciari R. Luneia R. Costantino G. Marinozzi M. Natalini B. Jakobsen P. Kanstrup A. Lombardi G. Moroni F. Tomsen G. 1-Aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid: a novel antagonist at phospholipase C-linked metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3717-3719Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) also caused a depression in EPSCKA in experiments at this temperature (76% ± 5%, n = 5, data not shown). These data demonstrate that mGluR5 is tonically activated by ambient glutamate levels in the slice and that this regulates EPSCKA. This regulation persists at physiological temperature, suggesting that this mechanism can operate in vivo. We were therefore interested to determine if there is an ionotropic mGluR5-mediated current that could be detected in these neurons. To determine if mGluR5 activation causes an increase in membrane conductance, we measured direct current (DC) during voltage-clamp recordings in the presence of picrotoxin, GYKI53633, and D-AP5. No change in DC was observed with bath application of MPEP at 28°C or at 35°C, either using a Cs-based or K-based whole-cell solution (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). In addition, we also investigated whether an mGluR5-mediated current could be evoked by synaptic stimulation at 35°C. Five-shock stimulation in the presence of picrotoxin, GYKI53655, and D-AP5 evoked EPSCKA but did not evoke any additional mGluR5-mediated current, since application of CNQX blocked all synaptic current and subsequent application of MPEP had no further effect (Figure S2A). Moreover, application of MPEP in the presence of picrotoxin, GYKI53655, and D-AP5 had no effect on the evoked EPSC kinetics (Figure S2B), further indicating that there was no mGluR5-dependent component to the EPSC. Therefore, in our experiments, no mGluR5-dependent current was observed. Previous work shows that PKC can regulate KAR function (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, we next analyzed the role of PKC in LTD of EPSCKA using the selective PKC inhibitory peptide PKC19-31. Inclusion of PKC19-31 (10 μM) in the electrode solution depressed EPSCKA but not EPSCAMPA (EPSCKA, 68% ± 6%; EPSCAMPA, 98% ± 4%, n = 9; Figure 6A). PKC19-31 also occluded subsequent LTD in the pharmacologically isolated EPSCKA (100% ± 10%, n = 7, Figure 6B), demonstrating a requirement for PKC activity in this form of LTD. PKC19-31 also completely prevented the MPEP-dependent depression in EPSCKA amplitude (in the presence of PKC19-31, EPSCKA amplitude = 68% ± 6% baseline before MPEP, 75% ± 6% after MPEP, n = 6, Figure 6C). Taken together, these findings indicate that a mechanism involving mGluR5 and PKC regulates synaptic KARs and that this mechanism interacts with the expression mechanism of EPSCKA LTD. KARs at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in hippocampus can be rapidly regulated by interactions with the PDZ domain containing protein PICK1 (Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Couthino V. Meyer G.

To determine whether this interaction is involved in EPSCKA LTD, we used the peptide pep2-EVKI (YNVYGIEEVKI), which selectively blocks PICK1 PDZ domain interactions (Li et al., 1999Li P.

Inclusion of pep2-EVKI (100 μM) in the intracellular solution caused a rapid reduction of the KAR-mediated component of the EPSC (74% ± 5%, p < 0.0001, n = 18; Figure 7A). The AMPAR-mediated component, however, was unaffected by pep2-EVKI (100% ± 4%, p > 0.5, n = 18, Figure 7A), as previously shown for hippocampal synapses (Daw et al., 2000Daw M.I. Chittajallu R.

Furthermore, pep2-EVKI occluded subsequent induction of EPSCKA LTD (92% ± 3%, p > 0.5, n = 6, Figure 7B). In interleaved control experiments, we tested the effect of pep2-SVKE (YNVYGIESVKE, 100 μM), an inactive mutant peptide (Li et al., 1999Li P. Kerchner G.A. Sala C. Wei F. Huettner J.E. Sheng M.

This peptide had no effect on either AMPAR- or KAR-mediated synaptic transmission (EPSCKA, 96% ± 5%, EPSCAMPA, 98% ± 6%, n = 10; Figure 7C) and did not prevent EPSCKA LTD (72% ± 3%, n = 7; Figure 7D). The GluR2 and -3 AMPAR subunits interact with NSF and AP2 at a C-terminal membrane proximal site, in addition to interacting with PICK and GRIP/ABP via the extreme C-terminal PDZ ligand (Collingridge et al., 2004Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T.R. Wang Y.-T. Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Since the NSF and AP2 interactions do not occur with KAR subunits, blockade of these interactions with pep2m (KRMKVAKNAQ) would be predicted to depress EPSCAMPA as previously reported (Nishimune et al., 1998Nishimune A. Isaac J.T.R. Molnar E. Noel J. Nash S.R. Tagaya M. Collingridge G.L. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. NSF binding to GluR2 regulates synaptic transmission.Neuron. 1998; 21: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, Collingridge et al., 2004Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T.R. Wang Y.-T. Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) but not to influence EPSCKA. Consistent with this, inclusion of pep2m (100 μM) in the recording solution caused a depression of EPSCAMPA (72% ± 5%, p < 0.005, n = 10; Figure 7E) but had no effect on EPSCKA (102% ± 3%, p > 0.5, n = 10; Figure 7E). Furthermore, pep2m had no effect on LTD of EPSCKA (72% ± 1%, p < 0.001, n = 5; Figure 7F). Thus, synaptic KARs are regulated differentially from AMPARs in perirhinal cortical neurons, and this provides the molecular basis for the mechanistically distinct forms of LTD for AMPAR and KAR-mediated transmission at this input. Although KARs have been shown to be involved in the induction of LTP at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in the hippocampus, a role in either the induction or expression of LTD has not been reported, despite their postsynaptic expression at numerous types of input in the brain (Lerma et al., 2001Lerma J. Patermain A.V. Rodriguez-Moreno A. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Molecular physiology of kainate receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 971-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Here we now show that KARs can undergo a form of LTD at synapses on layer II/III neurons in perirhinal cortex. EPSCKA LTD is mechanistically distinct from LTD of AMPAR-mediated transmission at this input. It has different induction frequency requirements, and, although it requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+, it does not depend on NMDARs or low-threshold voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Rather, it requires synaptic activation of the KARs, which are inwardly rectifying, and release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. We further show that EPSCKA is tonically regulated by mGluR5 that is activated by ambient levels of glutamate. Expression of EPSCKA LTD occludes with this mGluR5-dependent regulation and involves PKC activity and PICK1 PDZ domain interactions, mechanisms that do not regulate AMPARs at the same inputs. Thus, we describe and characterize a form of activity-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity of kainate receptor-mediated synaptic transmission. LTD of EPSCKA requires a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration and influx of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane. However, this form of LTD does not require NMDARs or T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels but is dependent on KAR activation that exhibits inward rectification characteristic of Ca2+-permeable receptors (Chittajallu et al., 1999Chittajallu R. Braithwaite S.P. Clarke V.R.J. Henley J.M. Kainate receptors: subunits, synaptic localisation and function.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 544-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar, Lerma et al., 2001Lerma J. Patermain A.V. Rodriguez-Moreno A. Lopez-Garcia J.C. Molecular physiology of kainate receptors.Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 971-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This suggests that it is Ca2+ influx through the synaptic KARs themselves that provides the required Ca2+ signal for LTD induction. This idea is supported by our previous work, which shows that KARs can mediate Ca2+ influx in cultured perirhinal cortical neurons (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We also show a requirement for release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores for EPSCKA LTD. This suggests that, during 5 Hz stimulation, Ca2+ influx through the Ca2+-permable KARs produces release of Ca2+ from stores, which then leads to the induction of LTD. The extent of editing of KAR subunits increases with postnatal age, reducing the Ca2+ permeability of the KAR complement (Chittajallu et al., 1999Chittajallu R. Braithwaite S.P. Clarke V.R.J. Henley J.M. Kainate receptors: subunits, synaptic localisation and function.Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 544-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we find that EPSCKA LTD is not readily induced by the 5 Hz stimulation protocol in adolescent (>2-week-old) animals (our unpublished data). Involvement of other (high-threshold) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mediating the Ca2+ influx is unlikely, since the neurons are voltage clamped at −70 mV during LTD induction. One possibility, however, is that mGluR5 is involved in the induction, consistent with the finding that there is an mGluR-dependent form of LTD of AMPAR-mediated transmission in other brain regions (e.g., Oliet et al., 1997Oliet S.H.R. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Two distinct forms of long-term depression coexist in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells.Neuron. 1997; 18: 969-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Whether mGluR5 is also required for induction of EPSCKA LTD is difficult to determine, since blockade of this receptor causes a rundown in EPSCKA that occludes subsequent LTD. Our data show that the induction requirements for LTD of EPSCAMPA at the same inputs are different from those for EPSCKA LTD. EPSCAMPA LTD requires NMDAR activation and can be induced with 1 or 5 Hz stimulation. In contrast, EPSCKA LTD is independent of NMDARs and cannot be induced by 1 Hz stimulation, while neither form is induced by 10 Hz stimulation. Therefore, at the level of induction mechanisms, LTD of AMPAR and KAR-mediated transmission at this input are distinct. EPSCKA LTD seems to require a rather precise frequency of stimulation (5 Hz) and cannot be evoked by 1 or 10 Hz despite using prolonged stimulus trains. The reason for this precise requirement is unclear and will be of great interest to determine in future studies. Blockade of mGluR5, PKC, or PICK1 PDZ domain interactions causes a rapid reduction in EPSCKA. This indicates that synaptic KAR function is maintained by a mechanism involving these proteins during basal transmission. Indeed, we show a tonic activation of mGluR5 by ambient levels of glutamate in the slice that regulates EPSCKA and blockade of which occludes with the effects of PKC inhibitors. The reduction in EPSCKA caused by blockade of mGluR5, PKC, or PICK1 PDZ domain interactions fully occludes EPSCKA LTD, indicating that these mechanisms all share a common downstream target that is likely the synaptic KAR (see Figure 8). One model that is consistent with these findings is that, during basal transmission, EPSCKA is maintained by the PICK1-KAR interaction that localizes PKC to the receptor, thus facilitating an mGluR5-PKC-dependent phosphorylation of the KAR. In this scenario, during LTD induction, store Ca2+ release initiated by synaptic KARs during 5 Hz stimulation causes a disruption of this mGluR5-PKC-PICK1-dependent maintenance pathway, resulting in the downregulation of synaptic KARs. In support of this hypothesis, the GluR5 KAR subunit C terminus has been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H.

Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, PICK1 dimerizes (Perez et al., 2001Perez J.L. Khatri L. Chang C. Srivastava S. Osten P. Ziff E.B. PICK1 targets activated protein kinase Calpha to AMPA receptor clusters in spines of hippocampal neurons and reduces surface levels of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5417-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts both with PKC (Staudinger et al., 1997Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. Specific interaction of the PDZ domain protein PICK1 with the COOH terminus of protein kinase C-alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and with the C terminus of GluR5 and -6 (Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Couthino V. Meyer G.

Furthermore, it has been shown that PICK1-PKC localizes to synapses following PKC activation (Chung et al., 2000Chung H.J. Xia J. Scannevin R.H. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. Phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 differentially regulates its interaction with PDZ domain-containing proteins.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7258-7267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Perez et al., 2001Perez J.L. Khatri L. Chang C. Srivastava S. Osten P. Ziff E.B.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5417-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the PICK interaction with GluR5 is regulated by Ca2+ (J. Hanley, unpublished data). In this mechanism, we favor the idea that synaptic KARs are directly regulated during EPSCKA LTD. However, an alternative possibility we cannot exclude is that the LTD induction protocol causes a reduction in mGluR5 function which then causes a downstream depression of EPSCKA due to a reduction in the tonic mGluR5-dependent maintenance of EPSCKA. The downregulation of KARs during LTD could be due to a loss of function of synaptic receptors or a removal of receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as has been proposed for the mechanism of AMPAR LTD (Kemp and Bashir, 2001Kemp N. Bashir Z.I. Long-term depression: a cascade of induction and expression mechanisms.Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 339-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, Collingridge et al., 2004Collingridge G.L. Isaac J.T.R. Wang Y.-T. Receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 952-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The loss of function of KARs that remain at the synapse could be achieved by dephosphorylation of one or more PKC sites on the C terminus of KAR subunits (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Couthino V. Meyer G.

Removal of KARs from the synaptic membrane could occur due to disruption of the PICK1-KAR interaction, as has been hypothesized previously (Hirbec et al., 2003Hirbec H. Francis J.C. Lauri S.E. Braithwaite S.P. Coussen F. Mulle C. Dev K.K. Couthino V. Meyer G. Isaac J.T.R. et al.Rapid and differential regulation of AMPA and kainate receptors at hippocampal mossy fibre synapses by PICK1 and GRIP.Neuron. 2003; 37: 625-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Either mechanism could produce a depression in EPSCKA, although it seems more likely that a removal of KARs from the membrane would produce a long-lasting decrease in EPSCKA, since receptors remaining at the membrane would be susceptible to rephosphorylation by PKC during low-frequency transmission following the LTD induction protocol. It is also possible that a component of the effects observed on EPSCKA, which has to be evoked by a train of five stimuli due to the small size of the current, could be due to actions at a presynaptic locus. However, the EPSCKA LTD is fully blocked by postsynaptic BAPTA, or postsynaptic PKC inhibitor, or postsynaptic pep2-EVKI peptide, strongly suggesting that both the induction and the expression of LTD are entirely postsynaptic. Furthermore, we have previously shown the postsynaptic regulation of KAR function by PKC phosphorylation by group I mGluRs and PKC (Cho et al., 2003Cho K. Francis J.C. Hirbec H. Dev K. Brown M.W. Henley J.M. Bashir Z.I. Regulation of kainate receptors by protein kinase C and metabotropic glutamate receptors.J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), further supporting the postsynaptic locus for this form of plasticity. LTD of KAR-mediated transmission at this input is distinct from EPSCAMPA LTD both in its induction requirements and expression mechanism. The coexistence of these two independent LTD mechanisms that can be induced under different conditions provides these inputs with a unique mechanism to differentially regulate two different modes of transmission. KAR-mediated transmission enables a large coincidence detection window but poorly transmits high-frequency afferent activity, while AMPAR-mediated transmission reliably transmits high-frequency information but has a small window for coincidence detection (Frerking and Ohliger-Frerking, 2002Frerking M. Ohliger-Frerking P. AMPA receptors and kainate receptors encode different features of afferent activity.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7434-7443PubMed Google Scholar). The coexistence of both modes of transmission at the same inputs, combined with their differential activity-dependent regulation, thus provides a mechanism to allow these inputs to rapidly and long-lastingly switch their mode of transmission."

Increased vulnerability, intracellular calcium level, and colocalization of RyR and PS2 in the neuronal cells expressing mutant PS2PC12 cells expressing mutant PS2 and cortical neurons from mutant PS2 transgenic mice were significantly more vulnerable against L-glutamate and Aβ treatment compared with PC12 cells expressing wild-type (WT) PS2, and cortical neurons from WT PS2 mice, as determined by MTT reduction assay in the PC12 cells, and by Trypan blue staining in cortical neuron or DAPI staining (data not shown). To determine whether PS2 mutations increase calcium release and the..."

We determined whether MT protects against coagulatory and fibrinolytic disturbance and systemic inflammation induced by intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in MT-I/II null (-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice. As compared with WT mice, MT (-/-) mice revealed significant prolongation of prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time, a significant increase in the levels of fibrinogen and fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and a significant decrease in activated protein C, after LPS treatment. LPS induced inflammatory organ damages in the lung, kidney, and liver in both genotypes of mice. The damages, including neutrophil infiltration, were more prominent in MT (-/-) mice than in WT mice after LPS treatment. In both genotypes of mice, LPS enhanced protein expression of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, granulocyte/macrophage-colony-stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-2, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, and keratinocyte chemoattractant in the lung, kidney, and liver and circulatory levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, MIP-2, and KC. In overall trends, however, the levels of these proinflammatory proteins were greater in MT (-/-) mice than in WT mice after LPS challenge. Our results suggest that MT protects against coagulatory and fibrinolytic disturbance and multiple organ damages induced by LPS, at least partly, via the inhibition of the expression of proinflammatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2002306934,"It is well established that agrin, an extracellular matrix protein, plays a crucial role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions. Recent evidence indicates that agrin also contributes to immunological synapse formation. However, little is known about how agrin induces the activation of lymphocytes and whose receptors mediate its regulatory effects on these cells. In the present study, agrin was detected in lymphocytes. Up-regulation of agrin expression was involved in lymphocyte activation whereas down-regulation of its expression led to inhibition of both antigen-specific and nonspecific lymphocyte activation, indicating an intrinsic role for agrin in the activation of lymphocytes. Unexpectedly, unlike that found in muscle cells where there is coexpression of muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) and alpha-dystroglycan receptors for agrin, only alpha-dystroglycan could be detected in lymphocytes. Confocal examination showed that alpha-dystroglycan colocalized with agrin in forming the immunological synapse. Down-regulation of alpha-dystroglycan expression inhibited lymphocyte activation even in the presence of agrin. However, agrin involved in down-regulation of alpha-dystroglycan receptors did not increase the inhibitory effect on lymphocytes activation. The anti-alpha-dystroglycan antibody also induced lymphocytes activation. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that agrin and alpha-dystroglycan mediate lymphocyte activation. Furthermore, agrin-involved lymphocyte activation is mediated by alpha-dystroglycan."
https://openalex.org/W2054692700,"Although mammalian cardiomyocytes lose their proliferative capacity after birth, there is evidence that postmitotic cardiomyocytes can proliferate provided that cyclin D1 accumulates in the nucleus. Here we show by Northern blot, Western analysis, and immunohistochemistry that 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) treatment of adult rats caused an increase of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels. The increased cyclin D1 protein content was associated with its translocation into the nucleus of cardiomyocytes. These changes were accompanied by the re-entry of cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle, as demonstrated by increased levels of cyclin A, PCNA, and incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA (labeling index was 30.2% in T3-treated rats vs. 2.2% in controls). Entry into the S phase was associated with an increased mitotic activity as demonstrated by positivity of cardiomyocyte nuclei to antibodies anti-phosphohistone-3, a specific marker of the mitotic phase (mitotic index was 3.01/1000 cardiomyocte nuclei in hyperthyroid rats vs. 0.04 in controls). No biochemical or histological signs of tissue damage were observed in the heart of T3-treated rats. These results demonstrated that T3 treatment is associated with a re-entry of cardiomyocytes into the cell cycle and so may be important for the development of future therapeutic strategies aimed at inducing proliferation of cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2105215745,"At the request of the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, we attempted to replicate the data of Professor Jacques Benveniste that digital signals recorded on a computer disc produce specific biological effects. The hypothesis was that a digitized thrombin inhibitor signal would inhibit the fibrinogen-thrombin coagulation pathway. Because of the controversies associated with previous research of Prof. Benveniste, we developed a system for the management of social controversy in science that incorporated an expert in social communication and conflict management. The social management approach was an adaptation of interactional communication theory, for management of areas that interfere with the conduct of good science. This process allowed us to successfully complete a coordinated effort by a multidisciplinary team, including Prof. Benveniste, a hematologist, engineer, skeptic, statistician, neuroscientist and conflict management expert. Our team found no replicable effects from digital signals."
https://openalex.org/W2125131431,"Opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like gene (OPCML), a recently identified tumor-suppressor, is frequently inactivated by allele loss and CpG island promoter methylation in epithelial ovarian cancer. Since elevated activation of the RAS signaling pathway, including overexpression of HER-2/neu and mutations of RAS and BRAF, is common in human ovarian carcinoma, we examined the cellular effect of oncogenic RAS on the expression status of OPCML in a genetically defined human ovarian cancer model. Our study revealed that RAS(V12)-mediated oncogenic transformation was accompanied by a concomitant loss of OPCML expression. Methylation-sensitive PCR analysis showed that the OPCML promoter was hypermethylated in RAS-transformed human ovarian epithelial cells (T29H) and that treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine promoted demethylation of the OPCML promoter and restored OPCML expression in T29H cells. Furthermore, suppression of oncogenic RAS activity by stable siRNA specific for HRAS(V12) led to the demethylation and re-expression of OPCML in T29H cells, demonstrating that oncogenic RAS activity is directly responsible for the observed OPCML promoter hypermethylation and epigenetic gene silencing of OPCML. Taken together, our study suggests that elevation of the RAS signaling pathway may play an important role in epigenetic inactivation of OPCML in human epithelial ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2060350864,"An effective clearance of microbes is crucial in host defense during infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that CC chemokine receptor 8 (CCR8) skews innate immune response during septic peritonitis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). CCR8 was expressed in resident peritoneal macrophages and elicited leukocytes during CLP in the wild-type CCR8+/+ mice. CCR8-/- mice were resistant to CLP-induced lethality relative to CCR8+/+ mice, and this resistance was associated with an augmented bacterial clearance in CCR8-/- mice. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages from CCR8-/- mice, but not neutrophils, exhibited enhanced bactericidal activities relative to those from CCR8+/+ mice. Upon stimulation with the bacterial component LPS, elevated levels of superoxide generation, lysosomal enzyme release, and nitric oxide generation, effector molecules for bacterial killing were detected in CCR8-/- macrophages relative to CCR8+/+ macrophages. In addition, CCR8-/- macrophages produced significantly higher levels than CCR8+/+ macrophages of several cytokines and chemokines known to augment bactericidal activities of leukocytes that include TNF-alpha, IL-12, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, and KC. Altogether, these results indicate that CCR8 may have a negative impact on host defense during septic peritonitis, providing a new paradigm for the role of CCR8 in innate immunity."
