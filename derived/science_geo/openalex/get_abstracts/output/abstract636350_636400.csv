https://openalex.org/W2957860555,"Recent reports attribute numerous regulatory functions to the nuclear paraspeckle-forming long non-coding RNA, nuclear enriched assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1), but the implications of its involvement in Parkinson's disease (PD) remain controversial. To address this issue, we assessed NEAT1 expression levels and cell type patterns in the substantia nigra (SN) from 53 donors with and without PD, as well as in interference tissue culture tests followed by multiple in-house and web-available models of PD. PCR quantification identified elevated levels of NEAT1 expression in the PD SN compared with control brains, an elevation that was reproducible across a multitude of disease models. In situ RNA hybridization supported neuron-specific formation of NEATl-based para-speckles at the SN and demonstrated coincreases of NEAT1 and paraspeckles in cultured cells under paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, neuroprotective agents, including fenofibrate and simvastatin, induced NEAT1 up-regulation, whereas RNA interference—mediated depletion of NEAT1 exacerbated death of PQ-exposed cells in a leucine-rich repeat kinase 2-mediated manner. Our findings highlight a novel protective role for NEAT1 in PD and suggest a previously unknown mechanism for the neuroprotective traits of widely used preventive therapeutics.—Simchovitz, A., Hanan, M., Niederhoffer, N., Madrer, N., Yayon, N., Bennett, E. R., Greenberg, D. S., Kadener, S., Soreq, H. NEAT1 is overexpressed in Parkinson's disease substantia nigra and confers drug-inducible neuroprotection from oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2959715062,"Cancer cells exploit many of the cellular adaptive responses to support their survival needs. One such critical pathway in eukaryotic cells is the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is important in normal physiology as well as disease states, including cancer. Since UPR can serve as a lever between survival and death, regulated control of its activity is critical for tumor formation and growth although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that one of the main transcriptional effectors of UPR, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) growth and survival. Using systemic unbiased gene expression and proteomic analyses, we identified a novel direct ATF4 target gene, family with sequence similarity 129 member A (FAM129A), which is critical in mediating ATF4 effects on prostate tumorigenesis. Interestingly, FAM129A regulated both PERK and eIF2α in a feedback loop that differentially channeled the UPR output. ATF4 and FAM129A protein expression is increased in patient PCa samples compared with benign prostate. Importantly, in vivo therapeutic silencing of ATF4-FAM129A axis profoundly inhibited tumor growth in a preclinical PCa model. These data support that one of the canonical UPR branches, through ATF4 and its target gene FAM129A, is required for PCa growth and thus may serve as a novel therapeutic target."

We analyzed effects of HAGLR, microRNA (miR)-143-5p and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)3 on esophageal cancer (EC) and the related mechanisms. Microarray analysis was used to screen out EC-related genes and the regulation network among HAGLR, miR-143-5p, and LAMP3. The regulatory mechanisms of HAGLR and miR-143-5p in EC were analyzed following the treatment of miR-143-5p mimic, miR-143-5p inhibitor, HAGLR vector, or small interfering RNA against HAGLR in EC cells. The expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, Twist1, Snail1, and E-cadherin as well as the abilities of cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were measured. The effects of the HAGLR/miR-143-5p/LAMP3 axis were determined in vivo by assessing tumor formation in nude mice. The expression of HAGLR and LAMP3 was increased, whereas that of miR-143-5p was diminished in EC tissues and cells. HAGLR could competitively bind to miR-143-5p, and miR-143-5p targeted LAMP3. Down-regulated HAGLR or up-regulated miR-143-5p increased E-cadherin expression and significantly diminished expression of LAMP3, N-cadherin, vimentin, Twist1, and Snail1. Moreover, down-regulated HAGLR inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and tumor growth. Moreover, down-regulation of HAGLR inhibited LAMP3 expression by sponging miR-143-5p, thereby suppressing the progression of EC. Taken together, our results suggest HAGLR acts as a competing endogenous RNA of miR-143-5p to increase the expression of LAMP3, thus promoting EMT, proliferation, invasion, and migration in EC cells.—Yang, C., Shen, S., Zheng, X., Ye, K., Sun, Y., Lu, Y., Ge, H. Long noncoding RNA HAGLR acts as a microRNA-143-5p sponge to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastatic potential in esophageal cancer by regulating LAMP3.

https://openalex.org/W2957900877,"Inactivation of the tumor suppressor NF2/merlin underlies neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) and some sporadic tumors. Previous studies have established that merlin mediates contact inhibition of proliferation; however, the exact mechanisms remain obscure and multiple pathways have been implicated. We have previously reported that merlin inhibits Ras and Rac activity during contact inhibition, but how merlin regulates Ras activity has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that merlin can directly interact with both Ras and p120RasGAP (also named RasGAP). While merlin does not increase the catalytic activity of RasGAP, the interactions with Ras and RasGAP may fine-tune Ras signaling. In vivo, loss of RasGAP in Schwann cells, unlike the loss of merlin, failed to promote tumorigenic growth in an orthotopic model. Therefore, modulation of Ras signaling through RasGAP likely contributes to, but is not sufficient to account for, merlin’s tumor suppressor activity. Our study provides new insight into the mechanisms of merlin-dependent Ras regulation and may have additional implications for merlin-dependent regulation of other small GTPases."

H2S reacts with oxidized thiol derivatives (i.e. disulfides and sulfenic acids) and thereby forms persulfides, which are plausible transducers of the H2S-mediated signaling effects. The one-cysteine peroxiredoxin alkyl hydroperoxide reductase E from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtAhpE–SH) reacts fast with hydroperoxides, forming a stable sulfenic acid (MtAhpE–SOH), which we chose here as a model to study the interactions between H2S and peroxiredoxins (Prx). MtAhpE–SOH reacted with H2S, forming a persulfide (MtAhpE–SSH) detectable by mass spectrometry. The rate constant for this reaction was (1.4 ± 0.2) × 103 m−1 s−1 (pH 7.4, 25 °C), six times higher than that reported for the reaction with the main low-molecular-weight thiol in M. tuberculosis, mycothiol. H2S was able to complete the catalytic cycle of MtAhpE and, according to kinetic considerations, it could represent an alternative substrate in M. tuberculosis. MtAhpE–SSH reacted 43 times faster than did MtAhpE–SH with the unspecific electrophile 4,4′-dithiodipyridine, a disulfide that exhibits no preferential reactivity with peroxidatic cysteines, but MtAhpE–SSH was less reactive toward specific Prx substrates such as hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. According to molecular dynamics simulations, this loss of specific reactivity could be explained by alterations in the MtAhpE active site. MtAhpE–SSH could transfer its sulfane sulfur to a low-molecular-weight thiol, a process likely facilitated by the low pKa of the leaving thiol MtAhpE–SH, highlighting the possibility that Prx participates in transpersulfidation.

https://openalex.org/W2960013601,"Meeting the reproductive health needs of women in post-conflict settings is a global health priority. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, social norms perpetuate gender-based violence and contribute to low contraceptive use and high fertility. The Masculinité, Famille, et Foi (MFF) intervention is working with communities in Kinshasa to create normative environments supportive of modern contraception access and use. Our analysis uses survey data collected from 900 men and women in 17 community groups prior to the MFF intervention. We aimed to measure the extent to which social norms influence intentions to use modern contraception. Using multiple items to assess social norms and reference groups related to family planning and gender equity, we identified four distinct social norms constructs through factor analysis. Through structural equation modeling, we found that social norms influence intentions to use modern contraception overall, but that normative influence varies by gender."
https://openalex.org/W2956249400,"Diarrhea, caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is a catastrophic gastrointestinal disease among suckling piglets, with high infectivity, morbidity, and mortality, causing huge economic losses to the pig industry. In the present study, we investigated the different microbiota from the cecal mucosa and cecal contents between healthy and PEDV-infected piglets. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to explore differences. The results revealed that microbial dysbiosis by PEDV infection occurred in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets at each microbial taxonomic level. The abundance of pathogenic bacteria associated with diseases, including diarrhea, was increased. The abundance of Fusobacterium was 26.71% and 33.91% in cecal mucosa and contents of PEDV-infected group, respectively, whereas that in the healthy groups was 17.85% and 9.88%. The proportion of Proteobacteria in the infected groups was relatively high (24.67% and 22.79%, respectively), whereas that in the healthy group was 13.13% and 11.34% in the cecal mucosa and contents, respectively. Additionally, the proportion of Bacteroidetes in the healthy group (29.89%, 37.32%) was approximately twice that of the PEDV-infected group (15.50%, 15.39%). ""Nitrate reduction"", ""Human pathogens diarrhea"", ""Human pathogens gastroenteritis"", ""Nitrite respiration"", and ""Nitrite ammonification"" were the enriched functional annotation terms in the PEDV-infected groups. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the cecal mucosa and contents of suckling piglets. Our findings suggest that determining the intestinal microbiota might provide a promising method to prevent PEDV and open a new avenue for future research."
https://openalex.org/W2958063021,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which has an unknown pathogenesis and lacks a curative treatment, is becoming more prevalent. A previous long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) profiling analysis revealed a potential role for fatty liver-related lncRNA 2 (FLRL2) in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. To further understand the role of FLRL2 in NAFLD and explore its therapeutic value, both in vivo and in vitro NAFLD models were constructed. Small interfering RNA and small hairpin RNA interference and adenovirus transfection were adopted to manipulate the expressions of FLRL2, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like (Arntl), and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) expression. Steatosis was evaluated through histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin and oil red O and also by quantitative triglyceride measurements. FLRL2 is a widely distributed nuclear lncRNA that is down-regulated in NAFLD. Overexpression of FLRL2 resolved steatosis, lipogenesis, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in NAFLD, and down-regulation of FLRL2 resulted in the opposite effects. Sequence analysis demonstrated that FLRL2 was located in the intronic region of the Arntl gene, and a luciferase assay showed transcriptional activation of the Arntl gene upon FLRL2 overexpression. A similar expression pattern and synergistic effect of Arntl manipulation was observed in NAFLD in vitro. Inhibition of Arntl partially reversed the steatosis amelioration induced by FLRL2 overexpression. Downstream Sirt1 was also inhibited in NAFLD and influenced by both FLRL2 and Arntl. In NAFLD mice, FLRL2 enhancement alleviated steatosis, activated the Arntl-Sirt1 axis, and inhibited lipogenesis, ER stress, and inflammation, providing preliminary evidence of the benefits of FLRL2-mediated gene therapy in NAFLD.-Chen, Y., Chen, X., Gao, J., Xu, C., Xu, P., Li, Y., Zhu, Y., Yu, C. Long noncoding RNA FLRL2 alleviated nonalcoholic fatty liver disease through Arntl-Sirt1 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2958606043,"Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to influence many biological processes, including the stimulation of cellular senescence and inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this research, we explored the mechanisms of RSV on EMT and cellular senescence through the expression of a DNA damage response (DDR) protein, Rad9, in breast and lung cancer cell lines. Upon treating breast and lung cancer cell lines with RSV at the concentrations of 10-50 μM, Rad9 expression was increased at both transcriptional and translational levels. The results indicated that RSV-induced Rad9 expression, mediated by DNA damage and ROS, can significantly suppress proliferation by activating cellular senescence, and diminishing the expression of EMT markers with concomitant downregulation of Slug in breast and lung cancer cell lines. By using a siRNA approach, RSV was shown to mediate cellular senescence and EMT through a Rad9-dependent mechanism. The treatment with RSV can inhibit the proliferation, EMT, and increase cellular senescence of breast and lung cancer cell lines by activating Rad9. Our results suggest that the breast and lung tumor suppressive activities of RSV are, at least in part, mediated by the upregulation of Rad9."
https://openalex.org/W2960400529,"The insulin resistance (IR) of ovarian granulosa cells from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) aggravates the abnormalities in steroidogenesis and anovulation, and chemerin is an adipokine involved in regulating adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. The role and underlying mechanism of chemerin in developing IR of the granulosa cells from PCOS remain unclear. Plasma, follicular fluid, and human granulosa-lutein cells (hGLs) were collected from non-PCOS and patients with PCOS with or without IR. The chemerin levels were elevated in both follicular fluid and hGL samples from patients with PCOS with IR, and the hGLs from patients with PCOS with IR showed decreased insulin sensitivity and impaired glucose uptake capacity. Moreover, treatment of chemerin attenuated insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by decreasing phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)1/2 Tyr612, phosphorylation of protein kinase B Ser473, and membrane translocation of glucose transporter type 4 through increasing Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS1 in cultured hGLs. These effects could be abolished by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of chemokine-like receptor 1. Furthermore, insulin induced the expression of chemerin in hGLs. Our findings demonstrate a novel role of chemerin in the metabolic dysfunction of PCOS, which suggested that chemerin and its receptor can be further implicated as potential therapeutic targets in the future treatment of PCOS.-Li, X., Zhu, Q., Wang, W., Qi, J., He, Y., Wang, Y., Lu, Y., Wu, H., Ding, Y., Sun, Y. Elevated chemerin induces insulin resistance in human granulosa-lutein cells from polycystic ovary syndrome patients."
https://openalex.org/W2957817001,"The major impediment to effective cancer therapy has been the development of drug resistance. The tumour suppressive transcription factor FOXO3 promotes cell cycle arrest, senescence and cell death, and mediates the cytotoxic and cytostatic functions of cancer therapeutics. In consequence, FOXO3 is often downregulated as an adaptive response in cancer and particularly in chemotherapeutic drug-resistant cells. Consistently, we find that FOXO3 expression is attenuated in the drug-resistant MCF-7-EpiR and MCF-7-TaxR compared to the parental MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Using ChIP, short-interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, and overexpression assays as well as Foxo1/3/4−/− MEFs, we establish the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress defence modulator PERK (eIF2AK3) as a direct downstream transcriptional target of FOXO3. In agreement, there is also a positive correlation between FOXO3 and PERK expression at the protein and RNA levels in breast cancer patient samples. We uncover that PERK expression is downregulated but its activity constitutively elevated in the drug-resistant cells. With this in mind, we exploit this adaptive response of low FOXO3 and PERK expression, and high PERK activity in drug-resistant breast cancer cells and show that these drug-resistant cells are specifically sensitive to PERK inhibition. In support of this finding, we show that ectopic overexpression of FOXO3 can reduce the sensitivity of the resistant cells to the PERK inhibitor GSK2606414, while the Foxo1/3/4−/− MEFs expressing lower levels of PERK are more sensitive to PERK inhibition compared to wild-type MEFs. PERK inhibitor-titration and -time course experiments showed that the drug-resistant cells, which express lower expression and higher activity levels of PERK, are more sensitive to the increasing concentrations of PERK inhibitor compared to parental MCF-7 cells. Our present work thus reveals a chemotherapeutic drug-resistant cancer cell vulnerability in PERK and suggests PERK as a potential target for cancer therapy, specifically in the context of drug-resistant cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2959190828,"Herbs have a long history of use as folk medicine anticonvulsants, yet the underlying mechanisms often remain unknown. Neuronal voltage-gated potassium channel subfamily Q (KCNQ) dysfunction can cause severe epileptic encephalopathies that are resistant to modern anticonvulsants. Here we report that cilantro (Coriandrum sativum), a widely used culinary herb that also exhibits antiepileptic and other therapeutic activities, is a highly potent KCNQ channel activator. Screening of cilantro leaf metabolites revealed that one, the long-chain fatty aldehyde (E)-2-dodecenal, activates multiple KCNQs, including the predominant neuronal isoform, KCNQ2/KCNQ3 [half maximal effective concentration (EC50), 60 ± 20 nM], and the predominant cardiac isoform, KCNQ1 in complexes with the type I transmembrane ancillary subunit (KCNE1) (EC50, 260 ± 100 nM). (E)-2-dodecenal also recapitulated the anticonvulsant action of cilantro, delaying pentylene tetrazole-induced seizures. In silico docking and mutagenesis studies identified the (E)-2-dodecenal binding site, juxtaposed between residues on the KCNQ S5 transmembrane segment and S4-5 linker. The results provide a molecular basis for the therapeutic actions of cilantro and indicate that this ubiquitous culinary herb is surprisingly influential upon clinically important KCNQ channels.-Manville, R.

https://openalex.org/W2960334670,"A monogalactosyl diacylglyceride (MGDG) was isolated as an antiviral component from Coccomyxa sp. KJ (IPOD FERM BP-22254) via bioassay-guided fractionation. α-Linolenic acid (C18:3) and 7,10,13-hexadecatrienoic acid (C16:3) accounted for approximately 72% and 23%, respectively, of the MGDG total fatty acids of the MGDG. The MGDG showed virucidal activity against herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), a pathogen that causes genital herpes. Physical changes in HSV-2 shape were observed after treatment with MGDG, including a decrease in particle size, and possible damage to the viral envelope, as assessed using electron microscopy. In accordance with the morphological findings, virus particles lost their ability to bind to host cells. HSV-2 treated with high concentrations of MGDG resulted in no pathogenicity in an animal model, indicating that MGDG exhibits irreversible virucidal activity against HSV-2 particles. In the animal model of HSV-2-induced genital herpes, intravaginally administered MGDG exerted a prophylactic effect by suppressing viral yields in the genital cavity and formation of herpetic lesions, resulting in a higher survival rate in treated mice than control mice administered solvent. Thus, MGDG offers a novel prophylactic option against HSV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2957059215,"Background Osteoporosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment remain suboptimal. Objectives We conducted a qualitative study to understand barriers towards care initiation and levers to improve awareness and management of osteoporosis among general practitioners (GPs). Methods Semi-structured face-to face interviews were conducted with 16 GPs in the Rhône area of France to explore their knowledge and representations regarding osteoporosis. A thematic analysis of transcripts was performed to identify GPs’ perceptions on osteoporosis diagnosis, prevention, treatment and patients’ expectations. Results Interviewed GPs considered osteoporosis far less important than other chronic diseases. They questioned whether osteoporosis was a disease or normal aspect of ageing. They associated osteoporosis with fragility fractures, female sex, menopause, and old age but rarely with male sex. They regarded bone mineral density as the reference diagnostic test, but certain GPs indicated that they had difficulties to interpret the results and to know when to prescribe. Biphosphonates were mentioned as the reference treatment but some GPs expressed distrust about osteoporosis medications. Most of them did not think to screen for osteoporosis risk factors in their patients in a preventive medical approach. They mentioned the lack of time to implement prevention and were expecting clear and pragmatic guidelines, as well as information campaigns in general population to increase awareness on osteoporosis. Conclusion GPs tended to underestimate the salience of osteoporosis. Clear recommendations, better awareness of GPs and the general population could improve osteoporosis prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2959357308,"Forested lands in the western USA have undergone changes in management and condition that are resulting in a shift towards climax vegetation. These changes can influence the quality and quantity of forage for herbivores that rely on early-seral plants. To evaluate how management of forested landscapes might affect nutrition for Shiras moose (A. a. shirasi) at large spatial scales, we focused on shrubs and evaluated summer diet composition, forage availability, and forage quality across 21 population management units encompassing >36,000 km2 in northern Idaho, USA. We identified 17 shrub species in the diets of moose, 11 of which comprised the bulk of the diets. These forage shrubs varied markedly in both energy (mean digestible energy for leaves ranged from 9.62 to 12.89 kJ/g) and protein (mean digestible protein for leaves ranged from 1.73 to 7.90%). By adapting established field sampling methods and integrating recent advances in remote sensing analyses in a modeling framework, we predicted approximations of current and past (i.e., 1984) quantities of forage shrubs across northern Idaho. We also created a qualitative index of population trend for moose across population management units using harvest data. Predicted quantities of forage shrubs varied widely across the study area with generally higher values at more northern latitudes. The quantity of forage shrubs was estimated to have declined over the past 30 years in about half of the population management units, with the greatest declines predicted for high-energy forage species. The population trend index was correlated with the percent change in availability of moderate-energy forage shrubs, indicating that availability of forage shrubs and change in availability over time might be affecting population dynamics for moose in northern Idaho. Our study highlights the importance of assessing how changes in forest management across broad spatiotemporal extents could affect wildlife and their habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2959123732,"The continuing spread of the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, a vector of many arboviruses and some dirofilarial worms, in Europe calls for advanced investigations on its ecological ability to establish and overwinter in temperate, more northern geographic regions. To meet this purpose, eggs of Ae. albopictus laboratory strains of tropical, subtropical and temperate origin were exposed to field conditions during one or two winter seasons in northeastern Germany. After 1 to 16 weeks of outdoor exposure, eggs were flooded in the laboratory, and the hatching rates were determined. During the winter season 2015/2016, when temperatures reached –10°C, the subtropical strain showed hatching after all time periods while the tropical strain displayed hatching only until two weeks of cold exposure. In the winter season 2016/2017, with temperatures as low as ‒6°C, all three strains produced hatching larvae after all time periods. Both the hatching rates and the hatching behaviour differed between the strains. Larvae of the subtropical and temperate strains hatched in installments over a period of four weeks while the larvae of the tropical strain hatched within a short time period, often one week. The results of the study demonstrate that Ae. albopictus strains of different, even tropical, origin might be able to survive a central European winter, although this is likely to depend on the specific course of the temperatures. Further studies with different temperature regimes and different mosquito strains are needed to specify these findings."

https://openalex.org/W2958847874,"Because of disturbance and plant species loss at the local level, many arid ecosystems in the western USA benefit from revegetation. There is a growing interest in improving revegetation success by purposefully inoculating revegetation plants with mutualistic endophytic fungi that increase plant stress tolerance. However, inoculant fungi must compete against fungi that indigenous to the habitat, many of which may not be mutualistic. Our overall goal, therefore, is to learn how to efficiently colonize revegetation plants using endophytic fungal inoculum. The goal will be facilitated by understanding the factors that limit colonization of plants by endophytic fungi, including inoculum dispersal and host compatibility. We analyzed endophytic fungal communities in leaves of Bromus tectorum and Elymus elymoides (Poaceae), Chrysothamnus depressus and Artemisia tridentata (Asteraceae), Alyssum alyssoides (Brassicaceae) and Atriplex canescens (Amaranthaceae), each occurring in each of 18 field plots. We found that dispersal limitation was significant for endophytic fungal communities of Atriplex canescens and Bromus tectorum, accounting for 9 and 17%, respectively, of the variation in endophytic fungal community structure, even though the maximum distance between plots was only 350 m. Plant species identity accounted for 33% of the variation in endophytic fungal community structure. These results indicate that the communities of endophytic fungi assembling in these plant species depend significantly on proximity to inoculum source as well as the identity of the plant species. Therefore, if endophytic fungi are to be used to facilitate revegetation by these plant species, land managers may find it profitable to consider both the proximity of inoculum to revegetation plants and the suitability of the inoculum to targeted host plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2960738047,"In this paper, we present a tattooing capsule endoscope (TCE) that can localize an intestinal lesion or tumor for a preoperative laparoscopic surgery. The TCE is based on a wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) structure and can be actively controlled by an external electromagnetic actuation system to move, observe, and mark the target lesion in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The TCE is designed to perform capsule locomotion, needle extrusion and intrusion motions, and ink injection. First, the TCE is controlled to move to the target lesion during GI tract diagnosis via a capsule endoscopic camera. Further, a tattooing needle is extruded by an electromagnetically controlled mechanism to puncture the tissue. Finally, the tattooing ink is injected by the chemically reacted carbon dioxide gas pressure that is triggered by a shape memory alloy wire and a reed switch. The reed switch is also activated by the external magnetic field flux density. The suggested methods were verified by the ex-vivo experiments. The TCE prototype was able to move to the target lesion and inject the ink beneath the mucosa layer safely, thereby leaving a visible tattooed mark for surgical lesion identification. The proposed TCE method can accelerate the development of functionalities as well as tattooing procedures of the WCE in the GI tract."
https://openalex.org/W2959434609,"The enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is a heterodimer composed of an α subunit and a heme-containing β subunit. It participates in signaling by generating cGMP in response to nitric oxide (NO). Heme insertion into the β1 subunit of sGC (sGCβ) is critical for function, and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) associates with heme-free sGCβ (apo-sGCβ) to drive its heme insertion. Here, we tested the accuracy and relevance of a modeled apo-sGCβ–HSP90 complex by constructing sGCβ variants predicted to have an impaired interaction with HSP90. Using site-directed mutagenesis, purified recombinant proteins, mammalian cell expression, and fluorescence approaches, we found that (i) three regions in apo-sGCβ predicted by the model mediate direct complex formation with HSP90 both in vitro and in mammalian cells; (ii) such HSP90 complex formation directly correlates with the extent of heme insertion into apo-sGCβ and with cyclase activity; and (iii) apo-sGCβ mutants possessing an HSP90-binding defect instead bind to sGCα in cells and form inactive, heme-free sGC heterodimers. Our findings uncover the molecular features of the cellular apo-sGCβ–HSP90 complex and reveal its dual importance in enabling heme insertion while preventing inactive heterodimer formation during sGC maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2957960833,"Human encroachment on nature grows constantly, increasing human-wildlife interactions. Flight initiation distance (FID, the distance at which animals flee from an approaching threat) is often used to measure antipredator behaviour and establish buffer zones to reduce human impact on wildlife. In this study, we approached 10 waterbird species on larger lakes and narrower rivers using a motorboat. We investigated whether water body type, season (winter/spring), approach starting distance, species body mass, and group size influenced bird FID. Average bird FID was 145 ± 92 m and differed between species. In general, FID of all species was larger on lakes than rivers and increased with increasing group size and approach starting distance. When analysed separately for the two most common species, common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), FID increased with increasing starting distance on rivers, but not lakes, likely because birds on lakes have enough time to evaluate the approaching object and take flight at great distance. Additionally, birds might perform different activities on lakes versus rivers, leading to varying energetic trade-offs between the two habitat types, which may affect the decision when to take flight. Finally, mallards aggregated in larger groups on lakes, which affected FID, likely due to enhanced visibility (i.e., earlier detection of the approaching boat) and detection probability (via increased group size) on lakes. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for habitat characteristics, such as water body type, when studying waterbird FID, because they can affect the visibility of stimuli, group size and potentially animal behaviour, factors which should be taken into account when planning buffer zones for waterbirds in conservation areas."

However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. In this study, we report that chronic physical restraint stress in mice decreases excitability specifically in layer 2/3 of pyramidal neurons within the prelimbic subarea of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) accompanied by the induction of depressive-like behavioral states. We found that a complex between G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) 158 (GPR158) and regulator of G protein signaling 7 (RGS7), a regulatory GPCR signaling node recently discovered to be a key modulator of affective behaviors, plays a key role in controlling stress-induced changes in excitability in this neuronal population. Deletion of GPR158 or RGS7 enhanced excitability of layer 2/3 PFC neurons and prevented the impact of stress. Investigation of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that the A-type potassium channel Kv4.2 subunit is a molecular target of the GPR158–RGS7 complex. We further report that GPR158 physically associates with Kv4.2 channel and promotes its function by suppressing inhibitory modulation by cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation. Taken together, our observations reveal a critical mechanism that adjusts neuronal excitability in L2/3 pyramidal neurons of the PFC and may thereby modulate the effects of stress on depression. Stress profoundly affects physiological properties of neurons across brain circuits and thereby increases the risk for depression.

The main limiting and destructive disease of potato is late blight, caused by Phytophtora infestans. Here, we present a multi-environmental analysis of the response to P. infestans using an association panel of 150 accessions of S. tuberosum Group Phureja, evaluated in two localities in Colombia. Disease resistance data were merged with a genotyping matrix of 83,862 SNPs obtained by 2b-restriction site–associated DNA and Genotyping by sequencing approaches into a Genome-wide association study. We are reporting 16 organ-specific QTL conferring resistance to late blight. These QTL explain between 13.7% and 50.9% of the phenotypic variance. Six and ten QTL were detected for resistance response in leaves and stem, respectively. In silico analysis revealed 15 candidate genes for resistance to late blight. Four of them have no functional genome annotation, while eleven candidate genes code for diverse proteins, including a leucine-rich repeat kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2962056762,"N-cadherin adhesion has been reported to enhance cancer and neuronal cell migration either by mediating actomyosin-based force transduction or initiating fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-dependent biochemical signalling. Here we show that FGFR1 reduces N-cadherin-mediated cell migration. Both proteins are co-stabilised at cell–cell contacts through direct interaction. As a consequence, cell adhesion is strengthened, limiting the migration of cells on N-cadherin. Both the inhibition of migration and the stabilisation of cell adhesions require the FGFR activity stimulated by N-cadherin engagement. FGFR1 stabilises N-cadherin at the cell membrane through a pathway involving Src and p120. Moreover, FGFR1 stimulates the anchoring of N-cadherin to actin. We found that the migratory behaviour of cells depends on an optimum balance between FGFR-regulated N-cadherin adhesion and actin dynamics. Based on these findings we propose a positive feed-back loop between N-cadherin and FGFR at adhesion sites limiting N-cadherin-based single-cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2957473511,"Objectives Autopsy rates worldwide have dropped significantly over the last decades and imaging-based autopsies are increasingly used as an alternative to conventional autopsy. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical performance and cost of minimally invasive autopsy. Methods This study was part of a prospective cohort study evaluating a newly implemented minimally invasive autopsy consisting of MRI, CT, and biopsies. We calculated diagnostic yield and clinical utility—defined as the percentage successfully answered clinical questions—of minimally invasive autopsy. We performed minimally invasive autopsy in 46 deceased (30 men, 16 women; mean age 62.9±17.5, min-max: 18–91). Results Ninety-six major diagnoses were found with the minimally invasive autopsy of which 47/96 (49.0%) were new diagnoses. CT found 65/96 (67.7%) major diagnoses and MRI found 82/96 (85.4%) major diagnoses. Eighty-four clinical questions were asked in all cases. Seventy-one (84.5%) of these questions could be answered with minimally invasive autopsy. CT successfully answered 34/84 (40.5%) clinical questions; in 23/84 (27.4%) without the need for biopsies, and in 11/84 (13.0%) a biopsy was required. MRI successfully answered 60/84 (71.4%) clinical questions, in 27/84 (32.1%) without the need for biopsies, and in 33/84 (39.8%) a biopsy was required. The mean cost of a minimally invasive autopsy was €1296 including brain biopsies and €1087 without brain biopsies. Mean cost of CT was €187 and of MRI €284. Conclusions A minimally invasive autopsy, consisting of CT, MRI and CT-guided biopsies, performs well in answering clinical questions and detecting major diagnoses. However, the diagnostic yield and clinical utility were quite low for postmortem CT and MRI as standalone modalities."

The GENECUBE (TOYOBO Co., Ltd.) is a novel, fully-automated gene analyzer that can purify DNAs and amplify target DNAs. In this study, we evaluated the ability of two newly developed GENECUBE assays to directly detect the nuc and mecA genes in blood culture medium; nuc is specific to Staphylococcus aureus, and mecA indicates methicillin resistance. We examined 263 positive blood culture samples taken at three hospitals from patients suspected of having staphylococcal bacteremia. The results were then compared with those obtained using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (Microscan system or Dry-plate EIKEN), and sequencing analysis. The GENECUBE assays had sensitivity and specificity of 100% in detecting both S. aureus and methicillin resistance in positive blood culture. The turnaround time of the examination was evaluated for 36 positive blood culture samples. The time between the initiation of incubation and completion of the GENECUBE examination was 23 h (interquartile range: IQR 21–37 h); the time between reporting of Gram stain examination and completion of the GENECUBE examination was 52 min (IQR 48–62 min). These findings show that the GENECUBE assays significantly reduce the assay time with no loss of sensitivity or specificity."

In this study, we introduced the LpP5CS (Lolium perenne L.) gene into switchgrass by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The transgenic lines (TG) were classified into two groups based on their phenotypes and proline levels. The group I lines (TG4 and TG6) had relatively high proline levels and improved biomass yield. The group II lines (TG1 and TG2) showed low proline levels, severely delayed flowering, stunted growth and reduced biomass yield. Additionally, we used RNA-seq analysis to detect the most significant molecular changes, and we analyzed differentially expressed genes, such as flowering-related and CYP450 family genes. Moreover, the biomass yield, physiological parameters, and expression levels of reactive oxygen species scavenger-related genes under salt stress all indicated that the group I plants exhibited significantly increased salt tolerance compared with that of the control plants, in contrast to the group II plants. Thus, genetic improvement of switchgrass by overexpressing LpP5CS to increase proline levels is feasible for increasing plant stress tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2961627456,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are a promising class of therapeutics that are starting to emerge in the clinic. Determination of intracellular concentrations required for biologic effects and identification of effective delivery vehicles are crucial for understanding the mode of action and required dosing. Here, we investigated which nuclear oligonucleotide concentration is needed for a therapeutic effect for a triplet repeat-targeting ASO in a muscle cell model of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). For cellular delivery, ASOs were complexed into nanoparticles using the cationic cell-penetrating peptides nona-arginine and PepFect14 (PF14). Although both peptides facilitated uptake, only PF14 led to a dose-dependent correction of disease-typical abnormal splicing. In line with this observation, time-lapse confocal microscopy demonstrated that only PF14 mediated translocation of the ASOs to the nucleus, which is the main site of action. Through fluorescence lifetime imaging, we could distinguish intact oligonucleotide from free fluorophore, showing that PF14 also shielded the ASOs from degradation. Finally, we employed a combination of live-cell fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy and demonstrated that intranuclear blocking-type oligonucleotide concentrations in the upper nanomolar range were required to dissolve nuclear muscleblind-like protein 1 foci, a hallmark of DM1. Our findings have important implications for the clinical use of ASOs in DM1 and provide a basis for further research on other types of ASOs.-Van der Bent, M.

However, the pathologic significance of β-cell insulin resistance and the underlying mechanisms contributing to defective insulin signaling in β cells remain largely unknown. Emerging evidence indicates that proinsulin misfolding is not only the molecular basis of mutant INS-gene–induced diabetes of youth (MIDY) but also an important contributor in the development and progression of T2D. However, the molecular basis of β-cell failure caused by misfolded proinsulin is still incompletely understood. Herein, using Akita mice expressing diabetes-causing mutant proinsulin, we found that misfolded proinsulin abnormally interacted with the precursor of insulin receptor (ProIR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), impaired ProIR maturation to insulin receptor (IR), and decreased insulin signaling in β cells. Importantly, using db/db insulin-resistant mice, we found that oversynthesis of proinsulin led to an increased proinsulin misfolding, which resulted in impairments of ProIR processing and insulin signaling in β cells. These results reveal for the first time that misfolded proinsulin can interact with ProIR in the ER, impairing intracellular processing of ProIR and leading to defective insulin signaling that may contribute to β-cell failure in both MIDY and T2D.—Liu, S., Li, X., Yang, J., Zhu, R., Fan, Z., Xu, X., Feng, W., Cui, J., Sun, J., Liu, M.

Our results revealed that genetic inhibition of RASSF1A in cardiomyocytes affords cardioprotection, whereas myeloid-specific deletion of RASSF1A exacerbates inflammation and injury caused by I/R in mice. Cell-based studies revealed that RASSF1A negatively regulates NF-κB and thereby attenuates inflammatory cytokine expression.

https://openalex.org/W2957105906,"Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) refers to the presence of distinct tumor cell populations. It provides vital information for the clinical prognosis, drug responsiveness, and personalized treatment of cancer patients. As genomic ITH in various cancers affects the expression patterns of genes, the expression profile could be utilized for determining ITH level. Herein, we present a novel approach to directly detect high ITH defined as a larger number of subclones from the gene expression pattern through machine learning approaches. We examined associations between gene expression profile and ITH of 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) showing high association, we evaluated the performance of our method in predicting ITH by employing three machine learning algorithms using gene expression profile data. We classified tumors into high and low heterogeneity groups using the learning model through the selection of LASSO feature. The result showed that support vector machines (SVMs) outperformed other algorithms (AUC = 0.84 in SVMs and 0.82 in Naïve Bayes) and we were able to improve predictive power by using both combined data from mutation and expression. Furthermore, we evaluated the prediction ability of each model using simulation data generated by mixing cell lines of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and obtained consistent results with using real dataset. Our approach could be utilized for discriminating tumors with heterogeneous cell populations to characterize ITH."
https://openalex.org/W2958214337,"Objective Screening for hepatitis C in Russia is a complex process that involves several visits and stepwise testing, limiting adherence and substantially reducing the yield in the identification of active infections. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different screening algorithms from a health system perspective. Methods A decision analytic model was applied to a hypothetical adult population eligible to participate in a general screening program for hepatitis C in Russia. The standard pathway (I: Screen for anti-HCV antibodies followed by a nucleic acid test for HCV RNA on antibody positives) was compared to three alternatives (II: Screen for antibodies, a reflexed test for HCV antigen on antibody positives, and RNA on antigen negatives; III: Screen for antibodies, a reflexed test for HCV antigen on antibody positives; IV: Screen for antigen). Each strategy considered a cascade of events (referral, adherence, testing, diagnosis) that must occur for screening to be effective. The primary measure of effectiveness was the number of diagnosed active infections. Calculations followed a health system perspective with costs derived from 2017 reimbursement rates and a willingness-to-pay of 2,000RUB ($82) per diagnosed active infection. Model was tested with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Non-adherence to screening stages reduced the capture rate of active infections in Strategy I from 79.0% to 40.6%. Strategies II, III, and IV were less affected and identified 69%, 67%, and 104% more infections. Average costs per diagnosed infection were decreased by 41% from 89,599RUB ($3,681) for I to 53,072RUB ($2,180), 53,004RUB ($2,177), and 59,633RUB ($2,450) for II, III, and IV, respectively. With a probability of 97%, Strategy III was most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio vs. I of -1,373RUB (CI: -5,011RUB to -2,033RUB; $-56; CI: -$206 to -$84). Below a willingness-to-pay of 91,000RUB ($3,738), Strategy IV was not cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of results. Conclusions Testing strategies for hepatitis C with HCV antigen on HCV antibody positive cases offer a streamlining opportunity for population screening programs. Those shall increase the chances for detecting active infections and are cost-effective over current practice in Russia."

Understanding of the phenotypic variation is an indispensable first step for developing breeding strategies. However, little information is known about the genetic variation in E. japonica—a monotypic species with abundant phenotypes that is mainly distributed in southern China. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic diversity of 67 E. japonica using 23 phenotypic traits. Our results showed that the Shannon–Wiener (I) index of qualitative traits ranged from 0.55 to 1.26, and the color traits had a relatively high I. The average coefficient of variation of compound leaf traits (14.74%) was higher than that of fruit and seed traits (12.77% and 11.47%, respectively). Principal component analysis also showed that compound leaf and fruit traits were important components of total variation. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant difference in elevation and fruit color, irregular ribs, leaf margin and texture. The F value within populations was smaller than among populations, indicating the variation in phenotypic traits among populations was much greater than within populations. Dehua and Zunyi populations had the highest coefficients of variation, whereas Wenzhou population had the smallest—which may be attributed to habitat destruction. According to Q-type clustering, 67 samples clustered into four groups, with those having similar phenotypes clustering into the same group. In general, leaf and fruit traits had abundant phenotypic diversity, representing the main sources of phenotypic variation. Combined with clustering results and field surveys, this study suggests that the phenotypes of E. japonica are classified into two main categories: The deciduous E. japonica present at high altitudes; and the evergreen E. japonica present at low altitudes. Excavating E. japonica variations provides a theoretical reference for its classification and diversity, and is of great significance for planning genetic resources and establishing conservation strategies."

The underlying cause of biliary sludge existence in patients with dementia is currently unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence, risk factors, and related outcomes of biliary sludge formation in the gallbladder of older adults with dementia.Cross-sectional study.Geriatric ward of University Hospital in Japan.Inpatients aged 80 and older living with dementia.We evaluated the presence of biliary sludge by diagnostic ultrasonography and collected data regarding patient demographic information, cognition (mini-mental state examination [MMSE]), physical activity (Barthel Index), oral food intake (food intake level scale [FILS]), clinical stage of dementia (functional assessment staging [FAST] of dementia), and patient performance status (Zubrod/ Karnofsky score).Male sex, larger gallbladder volume and calories from oral intake were significantly associated with the presence of biliary sludge (P = .02, .02, .002, respectively). There was a significant negative correlation between the FAST stage and the FILS level in all patients (P < .001). More advanced dementia and dysphagia was more likely to be found in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) with biliary sludge, compared to patients with AD without biliary sludge (FAST 7a, FILS II and FAST 6c, FILS V, respectively, P = .06, 04). A logistic regression analysis revealed that the eating status of FILS I and II, generally called ""fasting or anorexia"", was a significant risk factor for forming biliary sludge in older adults with dementia (P = .031, odds ratio: 5.25, 95% confidence interval: 1.16-23.72).Fasting status may be associated with the existence of biliary sludge in older adults with dementia. Therefore, supportive care for eating might be an important solution to comfortable end-of-life care for older adults with advanced dementia."

Trajectories of PA and associated factors have been studied in older adults aged ≥65, but less is known about influences on PA change in the very old (aged ≥85). Objective To investigate factors associated with self-reported PA and PA change over time in very old adults. Methods 845 participants in the Newcastle 85+ Study were followed for health and functioning at 1.5-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up (wave 2 to 4). PA scores (range 0–18) and PA levels (low (PA scores 0–1), medium (2–6) and high (7–18)) were determined using a purpose-designed PA questionnaire. We used linear mixed models (LMM) to investigate factors associated with 5-year change in PA scores. Results Overall, men had higher mean PA scores than women (up to 2.27 points). The highest proportion of participants (42–48%) had medium levels of PA across the waves. Although most experienced decline—stability in moderate and increases in high PA levels were also observed. The fully adjusted LMM revealed a curvilinear annual decline in PA scores of 0.52 (0.13) (β (SE), p<0.001), which decelerated by 0.07 (0.02) points (p<0.01) over time. The factors associated with low PA scores at baseline were female gender, higher waist-hip ratio, and no alcohol intake. Better self-rated and cognitive health and having fewer diseases were associated with higher PA scores. None were associated with the rate of change in PA over time. Conclusion We observed a curvilinear trend and deceleration in PA scores decline in the very old. Men and those in better health and who drank alcohol were more physically active at baseline. None of the factors were associated with the rate of PA decline. Investigating those who maintain or increase levels of PA may inform interventions for at risk groups with PA decline."

Method Data from 253 individuals from a public hospital dental waiting room were gathered using a previously validated survey following an oral health education video intervention, and analysed using descriptive analysis, Fischer’s Exact Test, and Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test across 3 time intervals. Results Participants across all ages evaluated the video oral health education approach as easy to follow and understand (p<0.001), the content practical and useful (p<0.001), and that it was a better experience (p<0.01). Those watching between 5 and 20 minutes reported that video was the best format to present oral care information (p<0.02).

Methods The cohort included 60 eyes in 30 patients treated at the Ophthalmology Clinic, Faculty Hospital Ostrava, from 2008 to 2013. Panretinal laser coagulation was performed on one eye using the multispot panretinal photocoagulation given in a single-session system Pascal (OptiMedica, Santa Clara, California). On the other eye laser treatment was carried out by the classic conventional multiple-session method. Results The performance of Pascal panretinal laser coagulation was evaluated as significantly less painful (visual scale of pain was 3.28 ± 1.9) than the performance of conventional photocoagulation (visual scale of pain was 3.93 ± 1.88) with similar efficiency. Distribution of progression of diabetic retinopathy in individual patients was very similar in both groups under comparison, and was strictly paired in 24 of the 30 patients at the end of 1-year follow-up. Conclusion Laser photocoagulation of the retina with the use of short impulse durations and patterns in patients with diabetic retinopathy given in one session possesses similar efficiency to that of conventional retinal photocoagulation in multiple sessions. The single session treatment is also better tolerated by patients and in addition to this, it shortens the performance of the whole therapy, which potentially saves considerable funds of all subjects participating in the process of treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2958596391,"Introduction Oral fluid sampling and testing offers a convenient, unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially grower and finisher swine. This assessment evaluates the potential testing of oral fluid samples with real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease for surveillance during a disease outbreak and early detection in a disease-free setting. Methods We used a series of logical arguments, informed assumptions, and a range of parameter values from literature and industry practices to examine the cost and value of information provided by oral fluid sampling and rRT-PCR testing for the swine foreign animal disease surveillance objectives outlined above. Results Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. The greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements relative to current individual animal sampling plans. For an early detection system, sampling every 3 days met the designed prevalence detection threshold with 0.95 probability, but was quite costly. Limitations Implementation of oral fluid testing for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease surveillance is not yet possible due to several limitations and information gaps. The gaps include validation of PCR diagnostic protocols and kits for African swine fever, classical swine fever, or foot-and-mouth disease on swine oral fluid samples; minimal information on test performance in a field setting; detection windows with low virulence strains of some foreign animal disease viruses; and the need for confirmatory testing protocol development."

This phenomenon has been observed in areas such as sports, education or business. Traditionally, the chi-square test has been used to analyze whether there are statistically significant differences in the distribution of births in each of the four quarters of the year. However, this approach is limited, focusing only on the analysis of the response variable, without taking into account the effect of a set of predictive variables. In this paper a new approach is proposed to study the relative age effect with the use of a logistic regression additive model. The new method has been evaluated with a sample of 21,639 players involved in football tournaments organized by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) between 1908 and 2012. New conclusions have been established that the relative age effect exists regarding player age and the year of the competition in male FIFA competitions and its effect is dynamic and complex."
https://openalex.org/W2959060758,"Recent recognition that TGF-β signaling disruption is involved in the development of aortic aneurysms has led to renewed investigations into the role of TGF-β biology in the aortic wall. We previously found that the type I receptor of TGF-β (TGFBR2) receptor contributes to formation of ascending aortic aneurysms and dissections (AADs) induced by smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific, postnatal deletion of Tgfbr1 (Tgfbr1iko). Here, we aimed to decipher the mechanistic signaling pathway underlying the pathogenic effects of TGFBR2 in this context. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that Tgfbr1iko triggers an acute inflammatory response in developing AADs, and Tgfbr1iko SMCs express an inflammatory phenotype in culture. Comparative proteomics profiling and mass spectrometry revealed that Tgfbr1iko SMCs respond to TGF-β1 stimulation via robust up-regulation of cyclophilin A (CypA). This up-regulation is abrogated by inhibition of TGFBR2 kinase activity, small interfering RNA silencing of Tgfbr2 expression, or inhibition of SMAD3 activation. In mice, Tgfbr1iko rapidly promotes CypA production in SMCs of developing AADs, whereas treatment with a CypA inhibitor attenuates aortic dilation by 56% (P = 0.003) and ameliorates aneurysmal degeneration (P = 0.016). These protective effects are associated with reduced aneurysm-promoting inflammation. Collectively, these results suggest a novel mechanism, wherein loss of type I receptor of TGF-β triggers promiscuous, proinflammatory TGFBR2 signaling in SMCs, thereby promoting AAD formation.—Zhou, G., Liao, M., Wang, F., Qi, X., Yang, P., Berceli, S.

https://openalex.org/W2960873736,"We previously reported that syndecan-2 expression is increased on the colonic epithelium during chronic inflammation. Here, we report that syndecan-2 exhibits a different pattern of site-specific colonic expression during acute inflammation. Syndecan-2 expression was up-regulated predominantly in the proximal colon of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice. The colitis-associated up-regulation of syndecan-2 was barely detected in Rag-1−/− (recombination activating gene 1 knockout) mice under colitis-inducing conditions. Increased syndecan-2 expression correlated with increased levels of infiltrated CD4+IL-17A+ T cells in the proximal colon. Serum levels of IL-17A were increased during the acute inflammatory response in normal mice but not Rag-1−/− mice. IL-17A directly induced IL-17 receptor (IL-17RA) and syndecan-2 expression in ex vivo-cultured proximal colon tissues and adenoma cell lines from proximal colon. IL-17RA knockdown reduced the IL-17A-mediated syndecan-2 expression in SNU1235 cells. No elevation of syndecan-2 or IL-17RA was observed in colonic tissues from IL-17A−/− mice during colitis induction. Finally, increased expression of syndecan-2 and IL-17RA was observed in the proximal colons of cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis mice and infectious pan colitis patients. Together, these data suggest that acute inflammation induces syndecan-2 expression predominantly in the proximal colon via IL-17A-IL-17RA signaling during the early stage of the inflammatory response and that proximal colonic syndecan-2 might be a biomarker for acute inflammation.—Hong, H., Song, H.-K., Hwang, E.

In this study, we considered the mdx mice—a murine model of DMD—to discover biomarkers of disease, as well as pharmacodynamic biomarkers responsive to prednisolone, a corticosteroid commonly used to treat DMD. Longitudinal urine samples were analyzed from male age-matched mdx and wild-type mice randomized to prednisolone or vehicle control via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A large number of metabolites (869 out of 6,334) were found to be significantly different between mdx and wild-type mice at baseline (Bonferroni-adjusted p-value < 0.05), thus being associated with disease status. These included a metabolite with m/z = 357 and creatine, which were also reported in a previous human study looking at serum. Novel observations in this study included peaks identified as biliverdin and hypusine. These four metabolites were significantly higher at baseline in the urine of mdx mice compared to wild-type, and significantly changed their levels over time after baseline. Creatine and biliverdin levels were also different between treated and control groups, but for creatine this may have been driven by an imbalance at baseline. In conclusion, our study reports a number of biomarkers, both known and novel, which may be related to either the mechanisms of muscle injury in DMD or prednisolone treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2960117445,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening immunological disease responsible for 1 to 2% of all deaths in 65 year old or older individuals. Although mononuclear cell infiltrates have been demonstrated in AAA lesions and autoimmunity may be responsible for the initiation and account for the propagation of the disease, the information available about the pathogenesis of AAA is limited. To examine whether AAA lesions from patients with AAA contain clonally expanded α-chain TCR transcripts, we amplified by the non-palindromic adaptor-PCR (NPA-PCR)/Vα-specific PCR and/or the Vα-specific PCR these α-chain TCR transcripts. The amplified transcripts were cloned and sequenced. Substantial proportions of identical α-chain TCR transcripts were identified in AAA lesions of 4 of 5 patients, demonstrating that clonally expanded T cells are present in these AAA lesions. These results were statistically significant by the bimodal distribution. Three of 5 of these patients were typed by DNA-based HLA-typing and all three expressed DRB1 alleles containing the DRβGln70 amino acid residue that has been demonstrated to be associated with AAA. All three patients exhibited clonally expanded T cells in AAA lesions. Four of the 5 patients with AAA who exhibited clonal expansions of α-chain TCR transcripts, also exhibited clonal expansions of β-chain TCR transcripts in AAA lesions, as we have demonstrated previously (J Immunol 192:4897, 2014). αβ TCR-expressing T cells infiltrating AAA lesions contain T-cell clones which have undergone proliferation and clonal expansion in vivo in response to as yet unidentified specific antigens that may be self or nonself. These results provide additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that AAA is a specific antigen-driven T-cell autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W2957134636,"Background & aims The bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis is an interaction where bacteria are housed in specialised structures in the leaves of their plant host. In the Rubiaceae plant family, host plants interact with Burkholderia bacteria. This interaction might play a role in the host plant defence system. It is unique due to its high specificity; the vertical transmission of the endophyte to the next generation of the host plant; and its supposedly obligatory character. Although previous attempts have been made to investigate this obligatory character by developing Burkholderia-free plants, none have succeeded and nodulating plants were still produced. In order to investigate the obligatory character of this endosymbiosis, our aims were to develop Burkholderia-free Psychotria umbellata plants and to investigate the effect of the absence of the endophytes on the host in a controlled environment. Methods The Burkholderia-free plants were obtained via embryo culture, a plant cultivation technique. In order to analyse the endophyte-free status, we screened the plants morphologically, microscopically and molecularly over a period of three years. To characterise the phenotype and growth of the in vitro aposymbiotic plants, we compared the growth of the Burkholderia-free plants to the nodulating plants under the same in vitro conditions. Key results All the developed plants were Burkholderia-free and survived in a sterile in vitro environment. The growth analysis showed that plants without endophytes had a slower development. Conclusions Embryo culture is a cultivation technique with a high success rate for the development of Burkholderia-free plants of P. umbellata. The increased growth rate in vitro when the specific endophyte is present cannot be explained by possible benefits put forward in previous studies. This might indicate that the benefits of the endosymbiosis are not yet completely understood."

The mechanism responsible for the generation of free N-glycans is now well-understood, but the issue of whether other types of free glycans are present remains unclear. Here, we report on the accumulation of free, O-mannosylated glycans in budding yeast that were cultured in medium containing mannose as the carbon source. A structural analysis of these glycans revealed that their structures are identical to those of O-mannosyl glycans that are attached to glycoproteins. Deletion of the cyc8 gene, which encodes for a general transcription repressor, resulted in the accumulation of excessive amounts of free O-glycans, concomitant with a severe growth defect, a reduction in the level of an O-mannosylated protein, and compromised cell wall integrity.

N- and O-glycosylations are major forms of co- and post-translational modifications in eukaryotes. The explosive advances in the field of glycobiology during the past 2 decades have revealed not only the pathways for the biosynthesis of glycans but also how glycans function in various biological processes, such as protein quality control, protein targeting, signal transduction, cell–cell interactions, immune responses, cell differentiation, and cancer metastasis (1Varki A.

The immature N-glycoproteins are then assisted by various ER-resident molecular chaperones, such as BiP, calnexin, and peptide disulfide isomerase, to achieve the correct protein folding and/or the formation of protein complexes.

Several studies of budding yeast have shown that O-mannosylation is involved in these two major biological processes. One is related to cell wall integrity. The rigid and protective layer of the cell wall, composed of heavily O-mannosylated and/or N-glycosylated proteins, is essential for cell viability and correct cell division during vegetative growth as well as under conditions of environmental stress (e.g. heat stress and proteolysis) (9Lesage G. Bussey H. Cell wall assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70 (16760306): 317-34310.1128/MMBR.00038-05Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 10Orlean P.

Mutants that are defective in the key O-mannosylation enzyme therefore exhibit slow growth due to the lack of cell wall integrity (11Gentzsch M. Tanner W.

The other pivotal function of O-mannosylation in the biological process is the quality control of newly synthesized proteins in the ER. It has been reported that some O-glycosylated model ERAD substrates, including α-factor, Gas1*, and KHNt, undergo excessive O-mannosylation by protein O-mannosyltransferases 1 and 2 (Pmt1 and Pmt2) (13Nakatsukasa K.

Moreover, in a recent study, Xu et al. (16Xu C. Wang S. Thibault G. Ng D.T. Futile protein folding cycles in the ER are terminated by the unfolded protein O-mannosylation pathway.Science. 2013; 340 (23704572): 978-98110.1126/science.1234055Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) clearly showed that O-mannosylation executed by Pmt1 and Pmt2 terminates attempts of long-retained misfolded proteins to undergo folding in the ER and facilitates their degradation. It therefore appears that both N- and O-glycosylation are critical for the recognition and elimination of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER (16Xu C. Wang S. Thibault G. Ng D.T.

First, in the peptide:N-glycanase (PNGase)-dependent pathway, FNGs are generated from misfolded glycoproteins by the action of a cytosolic PNGase (Png1). In the second, the oligosaccharyltransferase-dependent pathway, mature forms of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) are liberated in the luminal side of the ER by oligosaccharyltransferase. The FNGs that accumulate in the ER are then processed by glycosidases in the ER and are eventually transported to the cytosol by an unidentified mechanism. The biological relevance of the formation/degradation of FNGs is, however, poorly understood. During our studies dealing with the functional importance of FNG generation, we analyzed the free oligosaccharides that had accumulated in yeast cells under various culture conditions. Surprisingly, novel forms of free oligosaccharides were observed when the cells were cultured in media containing mannose as the carbon source. Extensive structural analyses clearly indicated that these oligosaccharides are structurally identical to the O-mannosyl glycans that are covalently attached to yeast glycoproteins. We hypothesized that the free O-glycans (FOGs) are probably liberated from O-glycoproteins by a putative endo-O-α-mannosidase–like activity. We also showed that the formation of FOGs is regulated by the general transcription repressor Cyc8, and further analyses suggested that the hyperactivation of the FOG generation pathway may result in the dysregulation of protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated cell wall integrity. Our results thus imply that a novel mechanism exists for regulating the catabolism of O-mannosyl glycans in yeast. The findings reported in our previous studies suggested that the yeast cytosolic/vacuolar α-mannosidase, Ams1, plays a pivotal role in the catabolism of FNGs that accumulate in the cytosol (22Hirayama H.

To understand the molecular mechanisms for the activation of the Ams1-dependent degradation of FNGs, we cultured yeast cells in various culture media for 3 h at 30 °C and profiled the structure of the PA-labeled FNGs by size-fractionation HPLC analysis. In normal culture media, YPGlc, the major form of FNGs was Hex7–9HexNAc2, as reported previously (22Hirayama H. Suzuki T. Metabolism of free oligosaccharides is facilitated in the och1Δ mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Glycobiology. 2011; 21 (21622726): 1341-134810.1093/glycob/cwr073Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 29Chantret I.

In contrast, the generation of FNGs was reduced when certain types of culture media, such as YPGal, YPGly, and YP, were used, probably due to the intracellular activation of Ams1. This result is consistent with previous observations that Ams1 activity is increased when the level of glucose in the culture media is reduced (25Hirayama H. Seino J. Kitajima T. Jigami Y. Suzuki T.

On the other hand, we unexpectedly discovered that large amounts of novel free oligosaccharides were produced only when the cells were grown in the YPMan medium (Fig. 1A, peaks a–d). The oligomers corresponding to these peaks were structurally altered on treatment with jack bean α-mannosidase (Fig. 1B), suggesting that they are α-mannosylated glycans. These results suggest that, in budding yeast, the generation of novel α-mannosylated free oligosaccharides can be induced by using YPMan as a medium. We next attempted to determine the structure of these novel free oligosaccharides. For this purpose, the compounds corresponding to the collected peaks a–d were subjected to structural and linkage analyses. The findings indicated that the MS values for peaks a–d corresponded to those of PA-Hex2–5. Moreover, analyses of these peaks after digestion with various glycosidases clearly indicated that the structures of the PA-Hex3–5 glycans (peaks b–d) were identical to those of the O-mannosyl glycans in S. cerevisiae (see Table 1, Table 2; see Fig. 1C for the structures of O-mannosyl glycans). We therefore hypothesized that these free glycans are derived from the O-mannosyl glycans on glycoproteins. To validate this hypothesis, the total amounts of free glycans in the two mutants that were defective in the first and second steps of mannose transfer reactions, pmt1Δ pmt2Δ and ktr1Δ kre2Δ ktr3Δ, respectively (see Fig. 1C for the transferase responsible for each mannose residue), were quantified. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), a substantial reduction in the level of Man2–5 free glycans was observed in the case of the ktr1Δ kre2Δ ktr3Δ cells. This result clearly suggests that the enzymes responsible for the addition of the second α-mannose of O-mannosyl glycans on glycoproteins is also required for the formation of Man2–5 free oligosaccharides, now designated as FOGs. There are, however, two possible scenarios for how these FOGs could be formed: 1) they are released from O-mannosylated glycoproteins by the action of an endo-O-α-mannosidase, or 2) they are formed by the same machinery that is involved in O-mannosylation by using free mannose as a donor. To distinguish between these two possibilities, cells defective in the first mannose transfer, pmt1Δ pmt2Δ, were tested for the formation of FOGs. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), a significant reduction in the generation of Man2–5 glycans was observed for the pmt1Δ pmt2Δ cells, indicating that the formation of O-mannosyl glycans is likely a prerequisite for the efficient formation of FOGs. This result therefore favors the first scenario (i.e. FOGs are formed from protein-linked O-mannosyl glycans by the action of an endo-O-α-mannosidase). Because the O-linked sugar chains are elongated starting at Man1 and proceed to Man5 in early to late Golgi, we suspected that the de-O-mannosylation of glycoproteins occurs in a late stage of the secretory pathway. To verify this hypothesis, we examined the generation of FOGs in a sec18-1 mutant, which is deficient in ER-to-Golgi trafficking at a nonpermissive temperature (37 °C). At the permissive temperature, significant amounts of Man2–5 FOGs were generated in sec18-1 cells. On the other hand, negligible generation of the Man2–5 of FOGs was observed at the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) (Fig. 1E), suggesting that functional ER-to-Golgi trafficking is required for the efficient production of FOGs. We also examined the time course for the generation of FNGs and FOGs. The rate of generation of FNGs was essentially unaltered during the time course analysis after changing the medium from YPGlc to YPMan, whereas the total amount of the FOGs in the cells reached a maximum at around 3 h (Fig. 1F). These results suggest that the concentration of mannose is a key trigger for the specific activation of the FOG generation pathway.Table 1MALDI-TOF MS analysis of size-fractionated glycansPeakObserved mass (m/z)Compositiona443.0 [M + Na]+Hex2-PAb605.3 [M + Na]+Hex3-PAc767.3 [M + Na]+Hex4-PAd929.5 [M + Na]+Hex5-PA Open table in a new tab Table 2Linkage analysis of unidentified glycans‡ A. saitoi α-1,2-Man’ase cannot digest PA-labeled α-1,2-mannobiose, which has a ring-opening mannose moiety in its reducing end.* Man3 was converted to Man2 due to the substrate specificity of A. saioi α-1,2-Man’ase as mentioned above.

Whereas it has been clarified that most of the FNGs in the WT are released from misfolded glycoproteins that are destined for ERAD by the action of Png1 (a cytosolic peptide:N-glycanase) (21Harada Y.

To clarify this issue, we utilized a reporter protein, Prc1pp-ManLe-FLAG. This reporter protein was composed of three functional domains: 1) the catalytic domain of an α-mannosidase derived from tomato (ManLe), which was successfully expressed by yeast cells as an active, secreted enzyme (30Hossain M.A. Nakano R. Nakamura K. Hossain M.T. Kimura Y. Molecular characterization of plant acidic α-mannosidase, a member of glycosylhydrolase family 38, involved in the turnover of N-glycans during tomato fruit ripening.J. Biochem. 2010; 148 (20798166): 603-61610.1093/jb/mvq094Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); 2) ER-targeting signal (Prc1-pre); and 3) vacuole-targeting signals (Prc1-pro) (Fig. 2A). The second and third domains were derived from a vacuolar protease, Prc1, and these domains were expected to allow this protein to be delivered to the vacuole via the Golgi-to-vacuole sorting receptor, Vps10. The Prc1pp-ManLe-FLAG expressed in ams1Δ or vps10Δ ams1Δ was N-glycosylated, indicating that this reporter protein is at least correctly targeted to the ER (Fig. 2B). We then proceeded to verify the intracellular amount of FOGs with or without the expression of Prc1pp-ManLe-FLAG. As shown in Fig. 2C, the expression of Prc1pp-ManLe-FLAG caused a significant reduction in the levels of FOGs in ams1Δ cells. On the other hand, in vps10Δ ams1Δ cells, the total amount of FOGs in the cell was comparable with that for ams1Δ cells with a vector control, possibly due to the defective transport of Prc1pp-ManLe-FLAG and/or its potential substrates to post-Golgi compartments. This result thus indicates that FOGs are, in sharp contrast to the case for most FNGs, generated in the lumenal side of the vesicles and most likely accumulated in a post-Golgi compartment, such as vacuoles. Having confirmed the source of the FOGs, we next examined the issue of how the YPMan culture conditions affect the N- and O-glycosylation status in yeast. To this end, the levels of nucleotide sugars, as well as the extent of N- and O-glycosylation on glycoproteins, were quantitated. The biosynthesis of nucleotide sugars is a crucial step for the synthesis of donor substrates for N-glycosylation and O-mannosylation, dolichol-linked oligosaccharide, and dolichyl-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) (Fig. 3A) (4Lehle L. Strahl S. Tanner W. Protein glycosylation, conserved from yeast to man: a model organism helps elucidate congenital human diseases.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45 (17024709): 6802-681810.1002/anie.200601645Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, a significant increase of the level of GDP-Man was observed when YPMan was used as the culture medium. In contrast, no increase in the levels of other nucleotide sugars, which are important for the biosynthesis of N-glycans, was observed (i.e. UDP-Glc and UDP-GlcNAc) (Fig. 3B). In addition, despite the increase in GDP-Man levels, the total level of N- and O-glycans on glycoproteins was comparable between the YPGlc and YPMan culture media (Fig. 3C). From these data, we conclude that, in the case of YPMan medium, the levels of both GDP-Man and FOGs were increased, whereas no significant increase in the levels of FNGs, N-glycosylation, or O-glycosylation was observed. It can therefore be safely assumed that the increase in FOGs is not simply due to the overloaded synthesis of O-glycans, but rather a regulated event that is controlled by medium conditions, including the enhanced catabolism of O-glycans. To gain additional insights into the regulation of the formation of FOGs under YPMan culture conditions, we examined the effect of glucose concentration in the culture media. As shown in Fig. 4A, small but significant amounts of FOGs were generated when a medium containing 1% glucose and 1% mannose was used. Most importantly, when a medium containing 0.2% glucose and 2% mannose was used, the generation of FOGs was significantly inhibited compared with a medium containing only 2% mannose (compare the first and second column of Fig. 4A). This fact led us to assume that the generation of FOGs is not only induced by the presence of mannose but is also strictly repressed by the presence of glucose in the media. We therefore further investigated the issue of whether the transcription factors involved in the regulation of catabolite repression also regulate the generation of FOGs. As shown in Fig. 4B, a deletion strain of one component of the general transcription repressor complex for glucose repression (i.e. cyc8Δ cells) exhibited a drastic increase (∼10-fold) in the generation of the FOGs. However, the deletion of other components of the repressor complex (i.e. mig1Δ and tup1Δ) showed no dramatic increase in the generation of FOGs, suggesting that Cyc8 is specifically involved in regulating the generation of FOGs. During the analysis of the FOGs in cyc8Δ cells, we also found that cyc8Δ grew more slowly than usual in YPMan medium. To dissect this phenotype further, cyc8Δ cells were cultured on plates containing several different carbon sources. As shown in Fig. 4C, attempts to grow cyc8Δ cells on YPMan plates resulted in severely retarded growth, whereas this was not observed for YPGlc or YPSuc plates, suggesting that the growth defect phenotype of cyc8Δ is specific for YPMan media. We further examined the detailed phenotype of the growth defect of cyc8Δ under various conditions (e.g. high temperature and the addition of cell wall perturbation reagents, calcofluor white (CFW) or Congo red (CR)). When cultured under YPMan at 30 and 36 °C, the cyc8Δ cells exhibited a strong growth defect (Fig. 4D, second and third panels). Furthermore, the cyc8Δ cells showed a strong sensitivity to YPMan supplemented with CFW or CR (Fig. 4D, fourth and fifth panels) even at 25 °C, indicating that the integrity of the cell walls in these cells had been"
https://openalex.org/W2960068212,"Guide dogs are working dogs that follow the verbal instructions of owners with severe visual impairments, leading them through the environment and toward goals such as a subway entrance (“Find the subway” instruction). During this process, guide dogs incidentally familiarize themselves with their environment. As such, they provide a unique animal model for studying wayfinding abilities in the canine species. In the present descriptive study, 23 skilled guide dogs travelled along a path once and were subsequently tested in a navigation task, with a blindfolded guide dog instructor as the handler. Dogs had difficulty reproducing the path (only 30.43% of the dogs succeeded) and returning (homing) along the previously travelled path (43.47% of the dogs succeeded). However, 80% of them successfully took a shortcut, and 86.95% a detour. This is the first description of the wayfinding abilities of dogs after a single discrete exploration of the path (incidental learning) in systematic experimental conditions. Errors, initiatives and success rates showed that dogs were able to keep track of the goal if the path was short, but errors increased with longer paths, suggesting segmented integration of path characteristics process, as demonstrated in humans. Additionally, errors on homing and detouring, both vital wayfinding tasks, were correlated, suggesting an effect of experience. Initiatives taken by the dogs further suggest flexibility of the spatial representation elaborated. Interestingly, we also found that homing was the only task to benefit from severe visual disability and regular exposure to new journeys, suggesting that these two factors influence the most important wayfinding task. This study therefore highlights qualitative and quantitative wayfinding abilities in the dog species, as well as the factors that account for them, after a single path exploration accompanied by natural ongoing motivation. In the wake of the discovery that dogs are sensitive to the magnetic field, our results provide the basis for developing systematic wayfinding tests for guide dogs."
https://openalex.org/W2961176611,"Rising hostility between members of opposing political factions has gained considerable attention in both academic and popular press. The adverse effects of this phenomenon are widely recognized, but its psychological antecedents remain the focus of ongoing debate in political psychology. Past research has honed in on two conflicting explanations: one highlights the extent to which people self-define as supporters of particular parties or candidates (the identity view), and another points toward the intensity with which they disagree on substantive matters of policy (the issues view). A nationally representative survey of 1051 eligible Spanish voters yielded support for both explanations. The perceived magnitude and nature of disagreement were associated with increased partisan prejudice, while controlling for partisan identification. Path analyses revealed that issue-based prejudice was more pronounced among ideologically extreme agents (β = 0.237, 95% CI [0.174, 0.300]) than toward extreme targets (β = 0.140, 95% CI [0.078, 0.201]), and replicated recent findings that identity-based prejudice is motivated primarily by non-instrumental factors (β = 0.286, 95% CI [0.230, 0.337]). Together, these results indicate that discrimination across party lines responds to two fundamentally distinct, though at times co-occurring, imperatives: to coalesce in ideologically homogeneous communities, and to protect one’s sense of partisan identity."
https://openalex.org/W2961660035,"Speech perception is influenced by vision through a process of audiovisual integration. This is demonstrated by the McGurk illusion where visual speech (for example /ga/) dubbed with incongruent auditory speech (such as /ba/) leads to a modified auditory percept (/da/). Recent studies have indicated that perception of the incongruent speech stimuli used in McGurk paradigms involves mechanisms of both general and audiovisual speech specific mismatch processing and that general mismatch processing modulates induced theta-band (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the theta modulation merely reflects mismatch processing or, alternatively, audiovisual integration of speech. We used electroencephalographic recordings from two previously published studies using audiovisual sine-wave speech (SWS), a spectrally degraded speech signal sounding nonsensical to naïve perceivers but perceived as speech by informed subjects. Earlier studies have shown that informed, but not naïve subjects integrate SWS phonetically with visual speech. In an N1/P2 event-related potential paradigm, we found a significant difference in theta-band activity between informed and naïve perceivers of audiovisual speech, suggesting that audiovisual integration modulates induced theta-band oscillations. In a McGurk mismatch negativity paradigm (MMN) where infrequent McGurk stimuli were embedded in a sequence of frequent audio-visually congruent stimuli we found no difference between congruent and McGurk stimuli. The infrequent stimuli in this paradigm are violating both the general prediction of stimulus content, and that of audiovisual congruence. Hence, we found no support for the hypothesis that audiovisual mismatch modulates induced theta-band oscillations. We also did not find any effects of audiovisual integration in the MMN paradigm, possibly due to the experimental design."

As part of a long-term study surveying the characteristics of childcare and development in Taiwan, we analyzed the relationship between OM and sources of psychological stress in children, such as poor maternal mental health and harsh parental discipline. We analyzed the data of 1998 children from the ""Kids in Taiwan: National Longitudinal Study of Child Development & Care (KIT) Project"" at the age of 3 years. Using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models, we tested several risk factors as potential independent predictors of two outcomes: parent-reported incidence of OM and child health. The proportion of children who had developed OM in the first 3 years of their life was 12.5%. Daycare attendance (odds ratio [OR]: 1.475; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.063-2.046), poor maternal mental health (OR: 1.913; 95% CI: 1.315-2.784), and harsh parental discipline (OR: 1.091; 95% CI: 1.025-1.161) correlated with parent-reported occurrence of OM. These findings suggest that providing psychosocial support to both parents and children might be a novel strategy for preventing OM."
https://openalex.org/W2958711432,"The co-existence of expansive arterial remodelling in both coronary arteries (CAs) and the abdominal aorta has already been reported, although the clinical indicators and quantitative analysis have not been well studied. We therefore aimed to clarify the clinical and anatomical characteristics of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). 123 AAA patients who underwent coronary angiography were compared to 123 control patients selected by propensity score matching. CA diameters of all 3 vessels were measured by quantitative coronary angiographic analysis. Coronary artery ectasia (CAE) was defined as local or generalized aneurysmal change of the CAs. Excessive expansive CA remodelling was defined as the maximal diameter of the right or left circumflex artery in the upper 75th percentile (>4.8 mm). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine predictors of CAE and excessive expansive CA remodelling. The prevalences of CAE and excessive expansive CA remodelling were significantly higher in the AAA group than in the non-AAA group (28% vs. 8% and 31% vs. 19%; both p<0.05). On multivariable analysis, the presence of AAA (odds ratio (OR), 4.56; 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) 2.18-10.4) and body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1.11; 95%CI 1.03-1.21) were independently associated with CAE, and higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR, 2.19; 95%CI 1.08-4.52) and BMI (OR, 1.11; 95%CI 1.02-1.21) were independently associated with excessive expansive CA remodelling. In conclusions, this study showed a higher prevalence of ectatic CA disease in AAA patients and suggests that higher inflammation and obesity are associated with expansive arterial remodelling in coronary arteries."
