https://openalex.org/W2077217951,"Aberrant activation of the canonical WNT/beta-catenin pathway occurs in almost all colorectal cancers and contributes to their growth, invasion and survival. Although dysregulated beta-catenin activity drives colon tumorigenesis, further genetic perturbations are required to elaborate full malignant transformation. To identify genes that both modulate beta-catenin activity and are essential for colon cancer cell proliferation, we conducted two loss-of-function screens in human colon cancer cells and compared genes identified in these screens with an analysis of copy number alterations in colon cancer specimens. One of these genes, CDK8, which encodes a member of the mediator complex, is located at 13q12.13, a region of recurrent copy number gain in a substantial fraction of colon cancers. Here we show that the suppression of CDK8 expression inhibits proliferation in colon cancer cells characterized by high levels of CDK8 and beta-catenin hyperactivity. CDK8 kinase activity was necessary for beta-catenin-driven transformation and for expression of several beta-catenin transcriptional targets. Together these observations suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting CDK8 may confer a clinical benefit in beta-catenin-driven malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W1969515779,"TRPML1 (mucolipin 1, also known as MCOLN1) is predicted to be an intracellular late endosomal and lysosomal ion channel protein that belongs to the mucolipin subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins. Mutations in the human TRPML1 gene cause mucolipidosis type IV disease (ML4). ML4 patients have motor impairment, mental retardation, retinal degeneration and iron-deficiency anaemia. Because aberrant iron metabolism may cause neural and retinal degeneration, it may be a primary cause of ML4 phenotypes. In most mammalian cells, release of iron from endosomes and lysosomes after iron uptake by endocytosis of Fe(3+)-bound transferrin receptors, or after lysosomal degradation of ferritin-iron complexes and autophagic ingestion of iron-containing macromolecules, is the chief source of cellular iron. The divalent metal transporter protein DMT1 (also known as SLC11A2) is the only endosomal Fe(2+) transporter known at present and it is highly expressed in erythroid precursors. Genetic studies, however, suggest the existence of a DMT1-independent endosomal and lysosomal Fe(2+) transport protein. By measuring radiolabelled iron uptake, by monitoring the levels of cytosolic and intralysosomal iron and by directly patch-clamping the late endosomal and lysosomal membrane, here we show that TRPML1 functions as a Fe(2+) permeable channel in late endosomes and lysosomes. ML4 mutations are shown to impair the ability of TRPML1 to permeate Fe(2+) at varying degrees, which correlate well with the disease severity. A comparison of TRPML1(-/- )ML4 and control human skin fibroblasts showed a reduction in cytosolic Fe(2+) levels, an increase in intralysosomal Fe(2+) levels and an accumulation of lipofuscin-like molecules in TRPML1(-/-) cells. We propose that TRPML1 mediates a mechanism by which Fe(2+) is released from late endosomes and lysosomes. Our results indicate that impaired iron transport may contribute to both haematological and degenerative symptoms of ML4 patients."

The strongest association was with a variant on 8q24, located 30 kb upstream of MYC in a haplotype block distinct from previously reported 8q24 cancer risk variants. We conducted a genome-wide SNP association study on 1,803 urinary bladder cancer (UBC) cases and 34,336 controls from Iceland and The Netherlands and follow up studies in seven additional case-control groups (2,165 cases and 3,800 controls). The strongest association was observed with allele T of rs9642880 on chromosome 8q24, 30 kb upstream of MYC (allele-specific odds ratio (OR) = 1.22; P = 9.34 × 10−12). Approximately 20% of individuals of European ancestry are homozygous for rs9642880[T], and their estimated risk of developing UBC is 1.49 times that of noncarriers. No association was observed between UBC and the four 8q24 variants previously associated with prostate, colorectal and breast cancers, nor did rs9642880 associate with any of these three cancers. A weaker signal, but nonetheless of genome-wide significance, was captured by rs710521[A] located near TP63 on chromosome 3q28 (allele-specific OR = 1.19; P = 1. 15 × 10−7)."
https://openalex.org/W2014241716,"Stress granules (SGs) and processing bodies (PBs) are microscopically visible ribonucleoprotein granules that cooperatively regulate the translation and decay of messenger RNA. Using an RNA-mediated interference-based screen, we identify 101 human genes required for SG assembly, 39 genes required for PB assembly, and 31 genes required for coordinate SG and PB assembly. Although 51 genes encode proteins involved in mRNA translation, splicing and transcription, most are not obviously associated with RNA metabolism. We find that several components of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, which reversibly modifies proteins with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) in response to stress, are required for SG and PB assembly. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are prominent components of SGs but not PBs, and include RACK1 (receptor for activated C kinase 1), prohibitin-2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and numerous ribosomal proteins. Our results suggest that O-GlcNAc modification of the translational machinery is required for aggregation of untranslated messenger ribonucleoproteins into SGs. The lack of enzymes of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in budding yeast may contribute to differences between mammalian SGs and related yeast EGP (eIF4E, 4G and Pab1 containing) bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2021886276,"Modern hard corals (Class Hexacorallia; Order Scleractinia) are widely studied because of their fundamental role in reef building and their superb fossil record extending back to the Triassic. Nevertheless, interpretations of their evolutionary relationships have been in flux for over a decade. Recent analyses undermine the legitimacy of traditional suborders, families and genera, and suggest that a non-skeletal sister clade (Order Corallimorpharia) might be imbedded within the stony corals. However, these studies either sampled a relatively limited array of taxa or assembled trees from heterogeneous data sets. Here we provide a more comprehensive analysis of Scleractinia (127 species, 75 genera, 17 families) and various outgroups, based on two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome oxidase I, cytochrome b), with analyses of nuclear genes (ß-tubulin, ribosomal DNA) of a subset of taxa to test unexpected relationships. Eleven of 16 families were found to be polyphyletic. Strikingly, over one third of all families as conventionally defined contain representatives from the highly divergent “robust” and “complex” clades. However, the recent suggestion that corallimorpharians are true corals that have lost their skeletons was not upheld. Relationships were supported not only by mitochondrial and nuclear genes, but also often by morphological characters which had been ignored or never noted previously. The concordance of molecular characters and more carefully examined morphological characters suggests a future of greater taxonomic stability, as well as the potential to trace the evolutionary history of this ecologically important group using fossils."
https://openalex.org/W2052547687,"The E2F1 transcription factor can promote proliferation or apoptosis when activated, and is a key downstream target of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (pRB). Here we show that E2F1 is a potent and specific inhibitor of beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF)-dependent transcription, and that this function contributes to E2F1-induced apoptosis. E2F1 deregulation suppresses beta-catenin activity in an adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)-independent manner, reducing the expression of key beta-catenin targets including c-MYC. This interaction explains why colorectal tumours, which depend on beta-catenin transcription for their abnormal proliferation, keep RB1 intact. Remarkably, E2F1 activity is also repressed by cyclin-dependent kinase-8 (CDK8), a colorectal oncoprotein. Elevated levels of CDK8 protect beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription from inhibition by E2F1. Thus, by retaining RB1 and amplifying CDK8, colorectal tumour cells select conditions that collectively suppress E2F1 and enhance the activity of beta-catenin."
https://openalex.org/W2087071891,"Cathelicidins are a family of antimicrobial peptides acting as multifunctional effector molecules of innate immunity, which are firstly found in mammalians. Recently, several cathelicidins have also been found from chickens and fishes. No cathelicidins from other non-mammalian vertebrates have been reported.In this work, a cathelicidin-like antimicrobial peptide named cathelicidin-BF has been purified from the snake venoms of Bungarus fasciatus and its cDNA sequence was cloned from the cDNA library, which confirm the presence of cathelicidin in reptiles. As other cathelicidins, the precursor of cathelicidin-BF has cathelin-like domain at the N terminus and carry the mature cathelicidin-BF at the C terminus, but it has an atypical acidic fragment insertion between the cathelin-like domain and the C-terminus. The acidic fragment is similar to acidic domains of amphibian antimicrobial precursors. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the snake cathelicidin had the nearest evolution relationship with platypus cathelicidin. The secondary structure of cathelicidin-BF investigated by CD and NMR spectroscopy in the presence of the helicogenic solvent TFE is an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation as many other cathelicidins. The antimicrobial activities of cathelicidin BF against forty strains of microorganisms were tested. Cathelicidin-BF efficiently killed bacteria and some fungal species including clinically isolated drug-resistance microorganisms. It was especially active against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, it could exert antimicrobial activity against some saprophytic fungus. No hemolytic and cytotoxic activity was observed at the dose of up to 400 microg/ml. Cathelicidin-BF could exist stably in the mice plasma for at least 2.5 hours.Discovery of snake cathelicidin with atypical structural and functional characterization offers new insights on the evolution of cathelicidins. Potent, broad spectrum, salt-independent antimicrobial activities make cathelicidin-BF an excellent candidate for clinical or agricultural antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W2048672579,"Here, we identify a panel of melanoma lines with non-V600E mutations in BRAF. These G469E- and D594G-mutated melanomas were found to exhibit constitutive levels of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and low levels of phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (pMEK) and were resistant to MEK inhibition. Upon treatment with the CRAF inhibitor sorafenib, these lines underwent apoptosis and associated with mitochondrial depolarization and relocalization of apoptosis-inducing factor, whereas the BRAF-V600E-mutated melanomas did not. Studies have shown low-activity mutants of BRAF (G469E/D594G) instead signal through CRAF. Unlike BRAF, CRAF directly regulates apoptosis through mitochondrial localization where it binds to Bcl-2 and phosphorylates BAD. The CRAF inhibitor sorafenib was found to induce a time-dependent reduction in both BAD phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression in the D594G/G469E lines only. Knockdown of CRAF using a lentiviral shRNA suppressed both Bcl-2 expression and induced apoptosis in the D594G melanoma line but not in a V600E-mutated line. Finally, we showed in a series of xenograft studies that sorafenib was more potent at reducing the growth of tumors with the D594G mutation than those with the V600E mutation. In summary, we have identified a group of melanomas with low-activity BRAF mutations that are reliant upon CRAF-mediated survival activity."
https://openalex.org/W2043526119,"Proteolysis targeting chimeric molecules (Protacs) target proteins for destruction by exploiting the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic system of eukaryotic cells. We designed two Protacs that contain the peptide ‘degron’ from hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, which binds to the Von –Hippel–Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, linked to either dihydroxytestosterone that targets the androgen receptor (AR; Protac-A), or linked to estradiol (E2) that targets the estrogen receptor-α (ERα; Protac-B). We hypothesized that these Protacs would recruit hormone receptors to the VHL E3 ligase complex, resulting in the degradation of receptors, and decreased proliferation of hormone-dependent cell lines. Treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells with Protac-B induced the degradation of ERα in a proteasome-dependent manner. Protac-B inhibited the proliferation of ERα-dependent breast cancer cells by inducing G1 arrest, inhibition of retinoblastoma phosphorylation and decreasing expression of cyclin D1, progesterone receptors A and B. Protac-B treatment did not affect the proliferation of estrogen-independent breast cancer cells that lacked ERα expression. Similarly, Protac-A treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells induced G1 arrest but did not affect cells that do not express AR. Our results suggest that Protacs specifically inhibit the proliferation of hormone-dependent breast and prostate cancer cells through degradation of the ERα and AR, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2095059750,"Cancer cells differentiate along specific lineages that largely determine their clinical and biologic behavior. Distinct cancer phenotypes from different cells and organs likely result from unique gene expression repertoires established in the embryo and maintained after malignant transformation. We used comprehensive gene expression analysis to examine this concept in the prostate, an organ with a tractable developmental program and a high propensity for cancer. We focused on gene expression in the murine prostate rudiment at three time points during the first 48 h of exposure to androgen, which initiates proliferation and invasion of prostate epithelial buds into surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme. Here, we show that androgen exposure regulates genes previously implicated in prostate carcinogenesis comprising pathways for the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Wnt signaling along with cellular programs regulating such ‘hallmarks’ of cancer as angiogenesis, apoptosis, migration and proliferation. We found statistically significant evidence for novel androgen-induced gene regulation events that establish and/or maintain prostate cell fate. These include modulation of gene expression through microRNAs, expression of specific transcription factors, and regulation of their predicted targets. By querying public gene expression databases from other tissues, we found that rather than generally characterizing androgen exposure or epithelial budding, the early prostate development program more closely resembles the program for human prostate cancer. Most importantly, early androgen-regulated genes and functional themes associated with prostate development were highly enriched in contrasts between increasingly lethal forms of prostate cancer, confirming a ‘reactivation’ of embryonic pathways for proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer progression. Among the genes with the most significant links to the development and cancer, we highlight coordinate induction of the transcription factor Sox9 and suppression of the proapoptotic phospholipid-binding protein Annexin A1 that link early prostate development to early prostate carcinogenesis. These results credential early prostate development as a reliable and valid model system for the investigation of genes and pathways that drive prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2007050986,"The 26 S proteasome is an energy-dependent protease that degrades proteins modified with polyubiquitin chains. It is assembled from two multi-protein subcomplexes: a protease (20 S proteasome) and an ATPase regulatory complex (PA700 or 19 S regulatory particle) that contains six different AAA family subunits (Rpt1 to -6). Here we show that binding of PA700 to the 20 S proteasome is mediated by the COOH termini of two (Rpt2 and Rpt5) of the six Rpt subunits that constitute the interaction surface between the subcomplexes. COOH-terminal peptides of either Rpt2 or Rpt5 bind to the 20 S proteasome and activate hydrolysis of short peptide substrates. Simultaneous binding of both COOH-terminal peptides had additive effects on peptide substrate hydrolysis, suggesting that they bind to distinct sites on the proteasome. In contrast, only the Rpt5 peptide activated hydrolysis of protein substrates. Nevertheless, the COOH-terminal peptide of Rpt2 greatly enhanced this effect, suggesting that proteasome activation is a multistate process. Rpt2 and Rpt5 COOH-terminal peptides cross-linked to different but specific subunits of the 20 S proteasome. These results reveal critical roles of COOH termini of Rpt subunits of PA700 in the assembly and activation of eukaryotic 26 S proteasome. Moreover, they support a model in which Rpt subunits bind to dedicated sites on the proteasome and play specific, nonequivalent roles in the asymmetric assembly and activation of the 26 S proteasome."

https://openalex.org/W2051144047,"Sensory systems create neural representations of environmental stimuli and these representations can be associated with other stimuli through learning. Are spike patterns the neural representations that get directly associated with reinforcement during conditioning? In the moth Manduca sexta, we found that odor presentations that support associative conditioning elicited only one or two spikes on the odor's onset (and sometimes offset) in each of a small fraction of Kenyon cells. Using associative conditioning procedures that effectively induced learning and varying the timing of reinforcement relative to spiking in Kenyon cells, we found that odor-elicited spiking in these cells ended well before the reinforcement was delivered. Furthermore, increasing the temporal overlap between spiking in Kenyon cells and reinforcement presentation actually reduced the efficacy of learning. Thus, spikes in Kenyon cells do not constitute the odor representation that coincides with reinforcement, and Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity in Kenyon cells alone cannot underlie this learning."
https://openalex.org/W2091960117,"MiRNAs (microRNAs) play critical roles in many important biological processes such as growth and development in mammals. In this study, we identified hundreds of porcine miRNA candidates through in silico prediction and analyzed their expression in developing skeletal muscle using microarray. Microarray screening using RNA samples prepared from a 33-day whole embryo and an extra embryo membrane validated 296 of the predicted candidates. Comparative expression profiling across samples of longissimus muscle collected from 33-day and 65-day post-gestation fetuses, as well as adult pigs, identified 140 differentially expressed miRNAs amongst the age groups investigated. The differentially expressed miRNAs showed seven distinctive types of expression patterns, suggesting possible involvement in certain biological processes. Five of the differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using real-time PCR. In silico analysis of the miRNA-mRNA interaction sites suggested that the potential mRNA targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs may play important roles in muscle growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2038520353,"We re-assess support for our three stage model for the peopling of the Americas in light of a recent report that identified nine non-Native American mitochondrial genome sequences that should not have been included in our initial analysis. Removal of these sequences results in the elimination of an early (i.e. approximately 40,000 years ago) expansion signal we had proposed for the proto-Amerind population.Bayesian skyline plot analysis of a new dataset of Native American mitochondrial coding genomes confirms the absence of an early expansion signal for the proto-Amerind population and allows us to reduce the variation around our estimate of the New World founder population size. In addition, genetic variants that define New World founder haplogroups are used to estimate the amount of time required between divergence of proto-Amerinds from the Asian gene pool and expansion into the New World.The period of population isolation required for the generation of New World mitochondrial founder haplogroup-defining genetic variants makes the existence of three stages of colonization a logical conclusion. Thus, our three stage model remains an important and useful working hypothesis for researchers interested in the peopling of the Americas and the processes of colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2079223115,"The ephrinA1 ligand exerts antioncogenic effects in tumor cells through activation and downregulation of the EphA2 receptor and has been described as a membrane-anchored protein requiring clustering for function. However, while investigating the ephrinA1/EphA2 system in the pathobiology of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), we uncovered that ephrinA1 is released from GBM and breast adenocarcinoma cells as a soluble, monomeric protein and is a functional form of the ligand in this state. Conditioned media containing a soluble monomer of ephrinA1 caused EphA2 internalization and downregulation, dramatic alteration of cell morphology and suppression of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Moreover, soluble monomeric ephrinA1 was functional in a physiological context, eliciting collapse of embryonic neuronal growth cones. We also found that ephrinA1 is cleaved from the plasma membrane of GBM cells, an event which involves the action of a metalloprotease. Thus, the ephrinA1 ligand can, indeed, function as a soluble monomer and may act in a paracrine manner on the EphA2 receptor without the need for juxtacrine interactions. These findings have important implications for further deciphering the function of these proteins in pathology and physiology, as well as for the design of ephrinA1-based EphA2-targeted antitumor therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2046177939,"A major question in understanding the functional organization of the brain is to delineate the functional divisions of the prefrontal cortex. Of particular importance to the cognitive capacities that are uniquely human is the fronto-polar cortex (Brodmann's area 10), which is disproportionally larger in humans relative to the rest of the brain than it is in the ape's brain. The specific function of this brain region remains poorly understood, but recent neuroimaging studies have proposed that it may hold goals in mind while exploring and processing secondary goals.Here we show that the extent of damage to the fronto-polar cortex predicts impairment in the management of multiple goals. This result reveals that the integrity of the fronto-polar cortex is necessary to perform tasks that require subjects to maintain a primary goal in mind while processing secondary goals, an ability which is crucial for complex human cognitive abilities.These results provide important new insights concerning the cerebral basis of complex human cognition such as planning and multitasking."
https://openalex.org/W2140735560,"Background As a group, fibroproliferative disorders of the lung, liver, kidney, heart, vasculature and integument are common, progressive and refractory to therapy. They can emerge following toxic insults, but are frequently idiopathic. Their enigmatic propensity to resist therapy and progress to organ failure has focused attention on the myofibroblast–the primary effector of the fibroproliferative response. We have recently shown that aberrant beta 1 integrin signaling in fibrotic fibroblasts results in defective PTEN function, unrestrained Akt signaling and subsequent activation of the translation initiation machinery. How this pathological integrin signaling alters the gene expression pathway has not been elucidated. Results Using a systems approach to study this question in a prototype fibrotic disease, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF); here we show organized changes in the gene expression pathway of primary lung myofibroblasts that persist for up to 9 sub-cultivations in vitro. When comparing IPF and control myofibroblasts in a 3-dimensional type I collagen matrix, more genes differed at the level of ribosome recruitment than at the level of transcript abundance, indicating pathological translational control as a major characteristic of IPF myofibroblasts. To determine the effect of matrix state on translational control, myofibroblasts were permitted to contract the matrix. Ribosome recruitment in control myofibroblasts was relatively stable. In contrast, IPF cells manifested large alterations in the ribosome recruitment pattern. Pathological studies suggest an epithelial origin for IPF myofibroblasts through the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In accord with this, we found systems-level indications for TGF-β -driven EMT as one source of IPF myofibroblasts. Conclusions These findings establish the power of systems level genome-wide analysis to provide mechanistic insights into fibrotic disorders such as IPF. Our data point to derangements of translational control downstream of aberrant beta 1 integrin signaling as a fundamental component of IPF pathobiology and indicates that TGF-β -driven EMT is one source for IPF myofibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2047379648,"Proline oxidase (POX), a flavoenzyme localized at the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the first step of proline degradation by converting proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). POX is markedly elevated during p53-induced apoptosis and generates proline-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS), specifically superoxide radicals, to induce apoptosis through both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways. These previous studies also showed suppression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leading us to broaden our exploration of proliferative signaling. In our current report, we used DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells stably transfected with the POX gene under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter and found that three pathways which cross talk with each other were downregulated by POX: the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. First, POX markedly reduced COX-2 expression, suppressed the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) and importantly, the growth inhibition by POX was partially reversed by treatment with PGE(2.) Phosphorylation of EGFR was decreased with POX expression and the addition of EGF partially reversed the POX-dependent downregulation of COX-2. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was decreased by POX in that phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) was decreased on the one hand and phosphorylation of beta-catenin was increased on the other. There changes led to decreased accumulation of beta-catenin and decreased beta-catenin/TCF/LEF-mediated transcription. Our newly described POX-mediated suppression of proliferative signaling together with the previously reported induction of apoptosis suggested that POX could function as a tumor suppressor. Indeed, in human colorectal tissue samples, immunohistochemically-monitored POX was dramatically decreased in tumors compared with normal counterparts. Thus, POX metabolism of substrate proline affects multiple signaling pathways, modulating both apoptosis and tumor growth, and could be an attractive target to metabolically control the cancer phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2031002692,"Dementia takes decades to develop, and effective prevention will likely require early intervention. Thus, it is critical to identify biomarkers of preclinical disease, allowing targeting of high-risk subjects for preventive efforts. Since telomeres shorten with age and oxidative stress, both of which are important contributors to the onset of dementia, telomere length might be a valuable biomarker.Among 62 participants of the Nurses' Health Study, we conducted neurologic evaluations, including patient and caregiver interviews, physical exam, neurologic exam, and neuropsychologic testing. We also conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a sample of 29 of these women. In these preliminary data, after adjustment for numerous health and lifestyle factors, we found that truncated telomeres in peripheral blood leukocytes segregate with preclinical dementia states, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI); the odds of MCI were 12-fold higher (odds ratio = 12.00, 95% confidence interval 1.24-116.5) for those with shorter telomere length compared to longer telomere length. In addition, decreasing telomere length was strongly related to decreasing hippocampal volume (p = 0.038).These preliminary data suggest that telomere length may be a possible early marker of dementia risk, and merits further study in large, prospective investigations."

In tumor cells, the inhibition of FAS elicits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, so it is considered a potential drug target for oncology. Results from this study show that inhibition of FAS, by either knockdown with small interfering RNA or inhibition with the small molecule drug orlistat, leads to activation of the receptor-mediated apoptotic cascade (caspase-8-mediated) and ultimately to cell death. However, knockdown of two enzymes upstream of FAS, acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α and ATP-citrate lyase, fails to activate caspase-8 or to elicit apoptosis in tumor cells, even though palmitate synthesis was suppressed. Using differential gene analysis, we traced the unique apoptotic effect of FAS inhibition to up-regulation of DDIT4 (DNA damage-inducible transcript 4), a stress-response gene that negatively regulates the mTOR pathway.

Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 7139-7145Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This tumor selectivity stems from the increased reliance of tumor cells on de novo fatty acid synthesis to satisfy their metabolic needs, whereas normal cells obtain most lipids from the dietary supply (16Kuhajda F.P. Nutrition. 2000; 16: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of FAS in tumors represents an overall activation of genes involved in lipogenesis (17Swinnen J.V. Vanderhoydonc F. Elgamal A.A. Eelen M. Vercaeren I. Joniau S. Van Poppel H. Baert L. Goossens K. Heyns W. Verhoeven G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 88: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Lipogenic enzymes that function upstream of FAS such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase-α (ACC-α) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) are elevated in cancer and, like FAS, have been implicated as targets for tumor treatment, suggesting that palmitate suppression can halt tumorigenesis (supplemental Fig. 1) (17Swinnen J.V.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), yet there are also other hypotheses on how inhibition of FAS elicits tumor cell death. Recent evidence has linked the inhibition of FAS to endoplasmic reticulum stress (24Little J.L. Wheeler F.B. Fels D.R. Koumenis C. Kridel S.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 1262-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the generation of reactive oxygen species (25Chajes V. Cambot M. Moreau K. Lenoir G.M. Joulin V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5287-5294Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), and ceramide accumulation (26Bandyopadhyay S. Zhan R. Wang Y. Pai S.K. Hirota S. Hosobe S. Takano Y. Saito K. Furuta E. Iiizumi M. Mohinta S. Watabe M. Chalfant C. Watabe K. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5934-5940Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, an understanding of how inhibition of FAS leads to apoptosis remains elusive. Here, we show that inhibition of FAS activates caspase-8 and induces tumor apoptosis but that knockdown of ACC-α or ACL is without effect, even though their knockdown suppresses palmitate production. These findings indicate that suppression of palmitate biosynthesis alone is not sufficient to elicit tumor cell death and reveal that inhibition of FAS has effects on tumor cells that extend beyond lipid biosynthesis. We traced these FAS-specific effects to its unique ability to up-regulate the stress-response gene DDIT4 (DNA damage-inducible transcript 4; also known as REDD1/RTP801/Dig2), which negatively regulates the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. Cell Lines—The MDA-MB-435 cell line was obtained from Janet Price (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). MCF-7, LNCaP, PC-3, and Hs58.Fs cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 tumor cells were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salts (Mediatech, Inc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), minimum Eagle's medium vitamins (Invitrogen), nonessential amino acids (Mediatech, Inc.), and antibiotics (Omega Scientific, Inc., Tarzana, CA). LNCaP and PC-3 tumor cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Human fibroblast Hs58.Fs cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37 °C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Gene Silencing Using Small Interfering RNA—All small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). SMARTpool siRNA contains a pool of four siRNA sequences directed against the target gene. The siRNA sequences targeting FAS (SMARTpool M-003954-02) were designed and pooled as described previously (9Knowles L.M. Axelrod F. Browne C.D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30540-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fibroblast and tumor cells were plated at 3.91 × 103 and 7.81 × 103 cells/cm2, respectively, and grown for 24–48 h prior to transfection with 1–100 nm FAS SMARTpool, FAS duplex 9 (D-003954-09), caspase-8 SMARTpool (M-003466-00), caspase-9 SMARTpool (M-003309-00), ACC-α SMARTpool (M-004551-02), ACL SMARTpool (M-004915-00), DDIT4 duplex 9 (J-010855-09), DDIT4 duplex 10 (J-010855-10), DDIT4 duplex 11 (J-010855-11), non-silencing control pool (D-001206-13), non-silencing control duplex 1 (D-001810-01), and non-silencing control duplex 2 (D-001210-02) siRNAs. Cells were transfected in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 5 h, cells were placed in normal culture medium and grown for an additional 42–91 h. Inhibition of FAS with Orlistat—Orlistat was extracted from Xenical™ capsules (Roche Applied Science) and stored as described previously (9Knowles L.M. Axelrod F. Browne C.D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30540-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fibroblast and tumor cells were plated at 3.91 × 103 and 7.81 × 103 cells/cm2, respectively, and grown for 24–48 h. The medium was subsequently removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), refed with fresh medium containing orlistat (0–50 μm), and grown for an additional 24–72 h. Measuring Fatty Acid Biosynthesis—In vivo fatty acid synthesis was measured according to the method described by Lee et al. (27Lee W.N. Bassilian S. Guo Z. Schoeller D. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E372-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 tumor cells were transfected with siRNA targeting FAS or ACC-α or non-silencing control siRNA for 48 h, washed with medium once, and labeled for 24 h in glutamine-free minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.5 g/liter [U-13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) and 2.0 g/liter unlabeled glucose (Sigma). Labeled cells were harvested using a cell scraper, rinsed with PBS, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was saponified with 1 ml of 30% KOH/ethanol (1:1, v/v) at 70 °C overnight. Neutral lipids were removed by petroleum ether extraction. The aqueous layer was acidified, and fatty acids were recovered by another petroleum ether extraction. The petroleum ether layer was backwashed with water and evaporated to dryness. Fatty acids were methylated with 0.5 n HCl in methanol (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed on the Trace GC/Trace MS Plus system (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA) using an Rtx-5MS column (fused silica, 15 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm; (Restek, Bellefonte). Gas chromatography conditions were as follows. The helium flow rate was 2 ml/min, and the oven temperature was programmed from 180 °C (1 min) to 210 °C at 3 °C/min. The interface temperature was maintained at 250 °C and the source temperature at 200 °C. Mass spectra were obtained using electron ionization at –70 eV. Palmitate, stearate, and oleate were monitored at m/z 270, 298, and 296, respectively. Mass isotopomer distribution was determined after correcting the contribution of labeling arising from natural abundances of carbon (13C), oxygen (17O, 18O), and hydrogen (2H) (28Wittmann C. Heinzle E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 62: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The 13C enrichment of acetyl units and the de novo synthesis of fatty acids were determined from the distribution of mass isotopomers of palmitate (27Lee W.N. Bassilian S. Guo Z. Schoeller D. Edmond J. Bergner E.A. Byerley L.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E372-E383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). De novo synthesis of palmitate produces palmitate with two, four, or six 13C atoms (m2, m4, and m6). Thus, the enrichment of acetyl units was calculated from the m4/m2 or m6/m4 ratio using the formula m4/m2 = (n – 1)/2*(p/q) and m6/m4 = (n – 2)/3*(p/q), where n is the number of acetyl units in palmitate (n = 8), p is the labeled fraction, and q is the unlabeled fraction (p + q = 1). De novo synthesis was then calculated by dividing the observed by the predicted mass isotopomer fraction, i.e. m2/(8*p*q7) or m4/(28*p2*q6). The effects of knockdown on glucose uptake were excluded based on the ratio of [13C]acetyl-CoA to the naturally labeled [12C]acetyl-CoA. No changes were observed in the fraction of the acetyl-CoA pool labeled by 13Cinany experiments. Measuring DNA Fragmentation—DNA fragmentation was measured using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Floating and adherent cell populations were harvested using a cell scraper and rinsed with PBS. Pellets were lysed in 2× SDS sample buffer, passed 10 times through an 18-gauge needle, boiled for 5 min, and stored at –80 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein was separated by SDS-PAGE; transferred onto nitrocellulose; stained with 0.05% Ponceau S (Sigma) to ensure equivalent protein loading per lane; and probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-9, anti-ACC, anti-ACL, anti-eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), anti-phospho-eIF4E (Ser209) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-FAS (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-FLICE-like inhibitory protein (FLIP; Dave-2; Axxora LLC, San Diego, CA), and anti-actin (Millipore) antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected using peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Relative band density was determined using AlphaImager Version 4.1.0 software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Assessing the Activity of Caspase-3/7—The activity of caspase-3 and caspase-7 was measured using the Apo-ONE® homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Cells were incubated with the caspase-3/7 substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-R110, and fluorescence intensity (Ex485 nm/Em538 nm) was measured using a fluorescent plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The amount of benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-R110 cleavage and fluorescence directly corresponded to caspase-3/7 activity. Gene Analysis—MDA-MB-435 tumor cells were treated with orlistat, EtOH, FAS, ACC-α, ACL, or non-silencing control siRNA on four separate occasions to generate biologically independent measurements for each treatment. Whole genome expression was examined 48 h following treatment. Total RNA was isolated from adherent cells using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and hybridized to the HumanRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip (>22,000 gene transcripts; Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. BeadChips were developed as described previously (29Knowles L.M. Smith J.W. BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression data were filtered to identify genes expressed on the BeadChip at >0.99 confidence (10,859 genes) and normalized per chip using nonlinear normalize.quantiles to remove array-to-array variability. Knockdown of the target genes were verified, leading to removal of one ACL treatment group from further analysis due to lack of gene suppression. Genes differentially expressed between treatments were identified using the GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 software package (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, chip normalized normalize.quantiles data were imported into GeneSpring GX 7.3.1 and per gene normalized to the appropriate biological control for each treatment replicate. Genes that significantly changed in response to orlistat or siRNA targeting FAS, ACC-α, or ACL compared with controls were identified using one-way analysis of variance with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate of 0.05. Genes with a p value ≤0.05 and with 1.5-fold changes occurring in three or more biological replicates for a given treatment were then overlapped using Venn diagrams to identify a set of genes modified solely by ACC-α and ACL siRNAs and those regulated by FAS siRNA and orlistat. Measuring Sensitivity to TRAIL—His6-FLAG-tagged recombinant soluble TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) was obtained from John Reed (Burnham Institute for Medical Research) (30Hyer M.L. Croxton R. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Kress C.L. Lu M. Suh N. Sporn M.B. Cryns V.L. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4799-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). MCF-7 tumor cells were exposed to either orlistat (0–25 μm) or 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (25 μm; Sigma) for 24 h or transfected with 25 nm FAS, ACC-α, ACL, or non-silencing control siRNA for 48 h. TRAIL sensitization was subsequently determined by incubating the cells with TRAIL (200–500 ng/ml) for 4 h and measuring the level of DNA fragmentation as described above. Knockdown of FAS Is Unique in Its Ability to Induce Tumor Cell Apoptosis—RNA interference was used to silence the expression of FAS, ACC-α, and ACL and to assess their effects on apoptosis in a panel of tumor cells lines (MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 mammary carcinoma cells and LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells). Off-target effects are a major concern when using siRNA-mediated gene silencing, especially when followed by gene expression analysis (31Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). We minimized off-target activity by using pools of four siRNA sequences (SMART-pools) (31Jackson A.L. Bartz S.R. Schelter J. Kobayashi S.V. Burchard J. Mao M. Li B. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 635-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Measurements of protein expression showed that the targeted SMARTpool siRNAs knocked down between 65 and 90% of cellular FAS, ACC-α, and ACL; the non-silencing control siRNA had no impact on the expression of these enzymes when compared against Lipofectamine 2000 transfection alone (Fig. 1A, right panels, and supplemental Fig. 2). Transfection with 25 nm FAS siRNA induced apoptosis in all four tumor cell lines (Fig. 1A). In contrast, knockdown of ACL failed to induce tumor cell death in MDA-MB-435, MCF-7, and LNCaP cells and had only minor apoptotic activity in PC-3 cells; knockdown of ACC-α also failed to induce DNA fragmentation. These results are consistent with the conclusion that knockdown of enzymes upstream of FAS is not sufficient to elicit an apoptotic response in tumor cells. Anti-tumor effects of FAS inhibition are proposed to be mediated by suppression of palmitate production (32Pizer E.S. Wood F.D. Pasternack G.R. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 745-751PubMed Google Scholar), so it is surprising that knockdown of ACC-α and ACL had little effect on tumor cell death. To confirm that knockdown of the target enzymes resulted in suppression of palmitate biosynthesis, we compared the effect of knockdown of ACC-α or FAS on palmitate biosynthesis in MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 1B). Cells were transfected with 25 nm siRNA targeting FAS or ACC-α, and 48 h later, cells were labeled with [U-13C]glucose for 24 h. The enrichment of [13C]acetyl-CoA and [13C]palmitate was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. As expected, knockdown of FAS or ACC-α blocked palmitate biosynthesis to comparable levels (49 and 55%, respectively). A similar level of palmitate inhibition following knockdown of ACL was reported previously (22Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 23Bauer D.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Andreadis C. Thompson C.B. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The suppression of palmitate was not due to differences in the uptake or utilization of glucose because the ratio of [13C]acetyl-CoA to naturally occurring [12C]acetyl-CoA was unchanged in all experiments (Fig. 1B). Because knockdown of FAS or ACC-α leads to an equivalent reduction in de novo palmitate biosynthesis, we concluded that suppression of fatty acid biosynthesis by itself is not sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis. It has also been suggested that inhibition of FAS induces apoptosis by increasing the concentration of malonyl-CoA, a substrate of FAS. If this were the case, one might expect that simultaneous inhibition of ACC-α, which produces malonyl-CoA, would rescue tumor cells from apoptosis. However, inhibition of neither ACC-α nor ACL could rescue cells from the apoptotic effects of knockdown of FAS (supplemental Fig. 3). Inhibition of FAS Induces Tumor Cell Apoptosis by Activating Caspase-8—To determine which apoptotic pathways are activated by inhibition of FAS, we examined the effects of FAS knockdown on the activation of caspase-8 (receptor-mediated apoptosis) and caspase-9 (stress-induced apoptosis) (33Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-435 cells were incubated either with a titration range of orlistat (0–50 μm) for 48 h or with 100 nm FAS siRNA for 72 h. Cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies specific for either full-length or cleaved (activated) caspase-8 and caspase-9. Inhibition of FAS by both FAS siRNA and orlistat induced activation of caspase-8 but failed to activate caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). Rescue experiments were conducted to verify that the apoptotic effects of FAS inhibition are elicited solely by caspase-8. Cells were cotransfected with siRNA targeting caspase-8 and caspase-9 along with FAS. Cell death was gauged by measuring DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B). Knockdown of caspase-8 rescued cells from FAS knockdown by 64%. Correspondingly, we observed a decrease in the activity of the executioner caspase-3/7 in response to the same treatment (Fig. 2C) (33Fuentes-Prior P. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 201-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). Knockdown of caspase-9 with siRNA failed to block apoptosis or the activation of caspase-3/7 (Fig. 2, B and C). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ablation of FAS induces apoptosis through caspase-8. In contrast to the effects of knockdown of FAS, knockdown of ACC-α or ACL was without effect on the activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 2D). Notably, the apoptotic effect is unique to tumor cells because it does not occur in normal fibroblasts (Fig. 2E). The unique effect of FAS ablation on caspase-8 was also observed in the MCF-7, LNCaP, and PC-3 tumor cell lines (supplemental Fig. 2). Inhibition of FAS Up-regulates the Expression of DDIT4—To better understand the link between inhibition of FAS and activation of caspase-8, we compared changes in gene expression induced by knockdown of FAS with those induced by knockdown of ACC-α or ACL. Genome-wide expression patterns were monitored in response to the knockdowns in the MDA-MB-435 cells. Three filtering criteria were applied to identify gene expression changes unique to inhibition of FAS: (i) only genes modified by at least at least 1.5-fold were considered; (ii) target genes had to be affected both by the siRNA targeting FAS and by treatment with orlistat; and (iii) target genes could not be modified by knockdown of ACC-α or ACL (meaning a change of <1.5-fold) because they are not linked to apoptosis. Three genes that met these criteria were identified (supplemental Table 1): GPX8 (also known as LOC493869), a sec24 homolog, and DDIT4. We chose to test the hypothesis that DDIT4 is a link between FAS and caspase-8 because this gene was up-regulated the most by ablation of FAS and because there is evidence in the literature showing that DDIT4 negatively regulates the mTOR pathway (34Sofer A. Lei K. Johannessen C.M. Ellisen L.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 5834-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 35Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9769-9772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To test whether up-regulation of DDIT4 is necessary for the activation of caspase-8 in response to FAS inhibition, we treated MDA-MB-435 cells with siRNA targeting FAS and DDIT4. This experiment showed that knockdown of DDIT4 prevented activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 3A). Thus, DDIT4 is necessary for the activation of caspase-8 in response to FAS inhibition. Inhibition of FAS Reduces the Expression of eIF4E and the Antiapoptotic Protein FLIP—DDIT4 is reportedly a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, a pathway that controls protein biosynthesis through activation of the rate-limiting translation initiation factor eIF4E (36Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 37Kleijn M. Scheper G.C. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We found that knockdown of FAS and orlistat reduced the phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 3B), showing that inhibition of FAS negatively regulates protein translation. Knockdown of ACC-α or ACL had no effect on eIF4E phosphorylation, confirming that down-regulation of protein translation is specific to the inhibition of FAS. Suppression of protein translation by mTOR inhibition has been linked to down-regulation of the synthesis of FLIP, an anti-apoptotic protein that blocks activation of caspase-8 (38Panner A. James C.D. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8809-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We also found that inhibition of FAS reduced the expression of both isoforms of FLIP, FLIPL and FLIPS (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of FAS Sensitizes Tumor Cells to TRAIL-induced Apoptosis—Interestingly, down-regulation of FLIP sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL (39Siegmund D. Hadwiger P. Pfizenmaier K. Vornlocher H.P. Wajant H. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the tumor necrosis factor family that activates caspase-8. We tested whether inhibition of FAS could be exploited as a means to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL. MCF-7 tumor cells that are resistant to TRAIL were used as a model (30Hyer M.L. Croxton R. Krajewska M. Krajewski S. Kress C.L. Lu M. Suh N. Sporn M.B. Cryns V.L. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 4799-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MCF-7 cells for 24 h with increasing concentrations of orlistat sensitized the cells to TRAIL (Fig. 4A). Very little apoptosis occurred in cells exposed to TRAIL along with vehicle (data not shown). Similar observations were observed using siRNA to inhibit FAS (Fig. 4B). In contrast, neither small molecule inhibition nor siRNA knockdown of ACC-α or ACL sensitized the tumor cells to TRAIL (Fig. 4B). The salient conclusions of this study are that inhibition of FAS, but not other enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, (i) induces apoptosis in tumor cells by activating caspase-8; (ii) up-regulates the stress-response gene DDIT4, which inhibits the mTOR pathway; and (iii) sensitizes tumor cells to the apoptotic protein TRAIL. FAS is required for both tumor cell growth and survival (9Knowles L.M. Axelrod F. Browne C.D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30540-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Pizer E.S. Chrest F.J. DiGiuseppe J.A. Han W.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4611-4615PubMed Google Scholar), yet the mechanistic links between FAS and tumor cell death have not been unraveled. Here, we have shown that knockdown of FAS or its inhibition with orlistat induces tumor cell apoptosis through activation of caspase-8, with no detectable role for caspase-9. Hence, the central mechanism of tumor cell apoptosis in response to inhibition of FAS is activation of caspase-8. Knockdown of FAS leads to activation of caspase-8 in both breast and prostate carcinoma cells and in both less aggressive (MCF-7 and LNCaP) and more aggressive (MDA-MB-435 and PC-3) tumor cell lines (40Price J.E.

Perhaps most significantly though, knockdown of ACL or ACC-α failed to induce caspase-8-mediated apoptosis, even though their inhibition reduced palmitate production to the same level as knockdown of FAS. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that a blockade of fatty acid biosynthesis alone is not sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis. Indeed, prior work showed that inhibition of ACL can inhibit tumor growth but that this effect results from inhibition of cell cycle progression, not through tumor cell apoptosis (22Hatzivassiliou G. Zhao F. Bauer D.E. Andreadis C. Shaw A.N. Dhanak D. Hingorani S.R. Tuveson D.A. Thompson C.B. Cancer Cell. 2005; 8: 311-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Similarly, a blockade of ACC-α by 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid fails to induce tumor cell apoptosis even though it inhibits palmitate biosynthesis (13Pizer E.S. Thupari J. Han W.F. Pinn M.L. Chrest F.J. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 44Zhou W. Simpson P.J. McFadden J.M. Townsend C.A. Medghalchi S.M. Vadlamudi A. Pinn M.L. Ronnett G.V. Kuhajda F.P. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7330-7337PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether then, there is a growing body of evidence that separates the apoptotic effects of FAS inhibitors from the de novo synthesis of palmitate. Therefore, the simplest interpretation of our findings is that a reduction in the de novo synthesis of palmitate alone is not sufficient for activation of caspase-8 or for tumor cell apoptosis. Our observations support a model whereby inhibition of FAS up-regulates DDIT4 and, as a result, interferes with mTOR signaling. DDIT4 is involved in a series of binding interactions that ultimately lead to mTORC1. DDIT4 binds 14-3-3, preventing 14-3-3 from sequestering TSC2 in a bound complex (46DeYoung M.P. Horak P. Sofer A. Sgroi D. Ellisen L.W. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 239-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Unbound TSC2 is therefore free to bind TSC1, and their complex acts as a negative regulator of Rheb, a positive upstream regulator of mTORC1 (47Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 48Tee A.R. Manning B.D. Roux P.P. Cantley L.C. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Consequently, inhibition of FAS negatively regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway (Fig. 5). The connection between FAS and mTOR probably also explains why inhibition of the enzyme elicits apoptosis through caspase-8. The inhibition of mTOR suppresses protein translation, thereby reducing biosynthesis of FLIP, which blocks the activation of caspase-8 (38Panner A. James C.D. Berger M.S. Pieper R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8809-8823Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Hence, the reduction in mTOR signaling caused by knockdown of FAS or by inhibition of FAS with orlistat releases a natural inhibition of caspase-8. The down-regulation of FLIP was found previously to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL (39Siegmund D. Hadwiger P. Pfizenmaier K. Vornlocher H.P. Wajant H. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which probably explains how inhibition of FAS sensitizes tumor cells to TRAIL. TRAIL triggers apoptosis through engagement of death receptors that trigger apoptosis by recruiting caspase-8 (49Sprick M.R. Weigand M.A. Rieser E. Rauch C.T. Juo P. Blenis J. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Immunity. 2000; 12: 599-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar, 50Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Because the effects of TRAIL are rather selective for tumor cells, this protein is considered an attractive target for cancer treatment. Currently, recombinant TRAIL and TRAIL receptor agonists are being tested in clinical trials and are showing encouraging anti-tumor activity (52Carlo-Stella C. Lavazza C. Locatelli A. Vigano L. Gianni A.M. Gianni L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 2313-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the potential of TRAIL as a chemotherapeutic agent is limited due to the emergence of TRAIL resistance (53LeBlanc H.N. Ashkenazi A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that such resistance could potentially be avoided or overcome by sensitizing tumor cells to this agent by combining it with an inhibitor of FAS. A similar strategy could also be applied to drug development programs aimed at inhibiting the mTOR pathway (54Faivre S. Kroemer G. Raymond E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 671-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Download .pdf (.34 MB) Help with pdf files"

https://openalex.org/W2053672186,"Speech production, like other sensorimotor behaviors, relies on multiple sensory inputs--audition, proprioceptive inputs from muscle spindles and cutaneous inputs from mechanoreceptors in the skin and soft tissues of the vocal tract. However, the capacity for intelligible speech by deaf speakers suggests that somatosensory input alone may contribute to speech motor control and perhaps even to speech learning. We assessed speech motor learning in cochlear implant recipients who were tested with their implants turned off. A robotic device was used to alter somatosensory feedback by displacing the jaw during speech. We found that implant subjects progressively adapted to the mechanical perturbation with training. Moreover, the corrections that we observed were for movement deviations that were exceedingly small, on the order of millimeters, indicating that speakers have precise somatosensory expectations. Speech motor learning is substantially dependent on somatosensory input."
https://openalex.org/W2014941287,"Bcor (BCL6 corepressor) is a widely expressed gene that is mutated in patients with X-linked Oculofaciocardiodental (OFCD) syndrome. BCOR regulates gene expression in association with a complex of proteins capable of epigenetic modification of chromatin. These include Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase components and a Jumonji C (Jmjc) domain containing histone demethylase. To model OFCD in mice and dissect the role of Bcor in development we have characterized two loss of function Bcor alleles. We find that Bcor loss of function results in a strong parent-of-origin effect, most likely indicating a requirement for Bcor in extraembryonic development. Using Bcor loss of function embryonic stem (ES) cells and in vitro differentiation assays, we demonstrate that Bcor plays a role in the regulation of gene expression very early in the differentiation of ES cells into ectoderm, mesoderm and downstream hematopoietic lineages. Normal expression of affected genes (Oct3/4, Nanog, Fgf5, Bmp4, Brachyury and Flk1) is restored upon re-expression of Bcor. Consistent with these ES cell results, chimeric animals generated with the same loss of function Bcor alleles show a low contribution to B and T cells and erythrocytes and have kinked and shortened tails, consistent with reduced Brachyury expression. Together these results suggest that Bcor plays a role in differentiation of multiple tissue lineages during early embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W2018589460,"Polyglutamine expansions of huntingtin protein are responsible for the Huntington neurological disorder. HIP14 protein has been shown to interact with huntingtin. HIP14 and a HIP14-like protein, HIP14L, with a 69% similarity reside in the Golgi and possess palmitoyl acyltransferase activity through innate cysteine-rich domains, DHHC. Here, we used microarray analysis to show that reduced extracellular magnesium concentration increases HIP14L mRNA suggesting a role in cellular magnesium metabolism. Because HIP14 was not on the microarray platform, we used real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR to show that HIP14 and HIP14L transcripts were up-regulated 3-fold with low magnesium. Western analysis with a specific HIP14 antibody also showed that endogenous HIP14 protein increased with diminished magnesium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, HIP14 and HIP14L mediate Mg2+ uptake that is electrogenic, voltage-dependent, and saturable with Michaelis constants of 0.87 +/- 0.02 and 0.74 +/- 0.07 mm, respectively. Diminished magnesium leads to an apparent increase in HIP14-green fluorescent protein and HIP14L-green fluorescent fusion proteins in the Golgi complex and subplasma membrane post-Golgi vesicles of transfected epithelial cells. We also show that inhibition of palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate, or deletion of the DHHC motif HIP14DeltaDHHC, diminishes HIP14-mediated Mg2+ transport by about 50%. Coexpression of an independent protein acyltransferase, GODZ, with the deleted HIP14DeltaDHHC mutant restored Mg2+ transport to values observed with wild-type HIP14. Although we did not directly measure palmitoylation of HIP14 in these studies, the data are consistent with a regulatory role of autopalmitoylation in HIP14-mediated Mg2+ transport. We conclude that the huntingtin interacting protein genes, HIP14 and HIP14L, encode Mg2+ transport proteins that are regulated by their innate palmitoyl acyltransferases thus fulfilling the characteristics of ""chanzymes."""

https://openalex.org/W2016193564,"The Americas were the last continents to be populated by humans, and their colonization represents a very interesting chapter in our species' evolution in which important issues are still contentious or largely unknown. One difficult topic concerns the details of the early peopling of Beringia, such as for how long it was colonized before people moved into the Americas and the demography of this occupation. A recent work using mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) data presented evidence for a so called ""three-stage model"" consisting of a very early expansion into Beringia followed by approximately 20,000 years of population stability before the final entry into the Americas. However, these results are in disagreement with other recent studies using similar data and methods. Here, we reanalyze their data to check the robustness of this model and test the ability of Native American mtDNA to discriminate details of the early colonization of Beringia. We apply the Bayesian Skyline Plot approach to recover the past demographic dynamic underpinning these events using different mtDNA data sets. Our results refute the specific details of the ""three-stage model"", since the early stage of expansion into Beringia followed by a long period of stasis could not be reproduced in any mtDNA data set cleaned from non-Native American haplotypes. Nevertheless, they are consistent with a moderate population bottleneck in Beringia associated with the Last Glacial Maximum followed by a strong population growth around 18,000 years ago as suggested by other recent studies. We suggest that this bottleneck erased the signals of ancient demographic history from recent Native American mtDNA pool, and conclude that the proposed early expansion and occupation of Beringia is an artifact caused by the misincorporation of non-Native American haplotypes."

To analyze total 1377 high-confident serum-proteins, we developed a computing strategy called localized statistics of protein abundance distribution (LSPAD) to calculate a significant bias of a particular protein-abundance between these two cohorts. As a result, 68 proteins were found significantly over-represented in the diabetic serum (p<0.01). In addition, a pathway-associated analysis was developed to obtain the overall pathway bias associated with type 2 diabetes, from which the significant over-representation of complement system associated with type 2 diabetes was uncovered. Moreover, an up-stream activator of complement pathway, ficolin-3, was observed over-represented in the serum of type 2 diabetic patients, which was further validated with statistic significance (p = 0.012) with more clinical samples.The developed LSPAD approach is well fit for analyzing proteomic data derived from biological complex systems such as plasma proteome. With LSPAD, we disclosed the comprehensive distribution of the proteins associated with diabetes in different abundance levels and the involvement of ficolin-related complement activation in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1992954790,"Resistance to chemotherapy is believed to be a major cause of treatment failure in pancreatic cancer. Thus, it is necessary to explore alternative therapeutic modalities to overcome drug resistance in pancreatic cancer treatment. We tested the hypothesis that Src tyrosine kinase inhibition could augment the chemosensitivity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells to 5-FU. As detected by MTT proliferation assay, propidium iodide and annexin V staining, a combination of 5-FU+Src kinase inhibitor PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) reflected the chemotherapeutic sensitivity and restored the 5-FU-induced apoptosis in 5-FU-resistant cells. Furthermore, when small-interfering RNA approach to silence Src gene expression was applied, the degree of 5-FU-induced apoptosis was increased in all cell lines independently of the chemoresistance status. Western blotting and RT–PCR analysis revealed that the expression of thymidylate synthase (TS) was higher in 5-FU-resistant cells, however, decreased significantly after pretreatment with PP2. Furthermore, the combination of 5-FU+PP2 decreased the 5-FU-induced activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–AKT pathway. Finally, PP2 in combination with 5-FU substantially decreased the in vivo tumor growth and inhibited distant metastases. Taken together, 5-FU chemoresistance can be reversed through indirect TS regulation by inhibiting Src tyrosine kinase. A potential mechanism of action of Src kinase inhibitors on 5-FU chemosensitivity might be linked to the inhibition of 5-FU-induced EGFR–AKT activation."
https://openalex.org/W2149509826,"Many people experience transient difficulties in recognizing faces but only a small number of them cannot recognize their family members when meeting them unexpectedly. Such face blindness is associated with serious problems in everyday life. A better understanding of the neuro-functional basis of impaired face recognition may be achieved by a careful comparison with an equally unique object category and by a adding a more realistic setting involving neutral faces as well facial expressions. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuro-functional basis of perceiving faces and bodies in three developmental prosopagnosics (DP) and matched healthy controls. Our approach involved materials consisting of neutral faces and bodies as well as faces and bodies expressing fear or happiness. The first main result is that the presence of emotional information has a different effect in the patient vs. the control group in the fusiform face area (FFA). Neutral faces trigger lower activation in the DP group, compared to the control group, while activation for facial expressions is the same in both groups. The second main result is that compared to controls, DPs have increased activation for bodies in the inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and for neutral faces in the extrastriate body area (EBA), indicating that body and face sensitive processes are less categorically segregated in DP. Taken together our study shows the importance of using naturalistic emotional stimuli for a better understanding of developmental face deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1993848738,"Opsin genes are expressed in a cell type-specific manner in the retina and the pineal organ for visual and nonvisual photoreceptive purposes, but the regulatory mechanism behind the tissue and cell selectivity is not well understood. In this study, we focus on the expression regulation of the blue-sensitive opsin gene SWS2 of zebrafish by taking a transgenic approach using the green fluorescence protein as an expression reporter. The zebrafish SWS2 is a single-copy gene and is expressed specifically in the “long single cones” in the retina. We found the following. 1) A 0.3-kb region between 0.6 and 0.3 kb 5′ of the SWS2 initiation codon, encompassing four cone-rod homeobox-binding sites (OTX sequences), contains the region necessary and sufficient to drive gene expression in long single cones. 2) A 15-bp portion (-341 to -327) in the 0.3-kb region represses the gene expression in the “short single cones,” which are dedicated to the UV-sensitive opsin gene SWS1. 3) An 11-bp sequence TAACTGCCAGT (-441 to -431) in the 0.3-kb region, with its adjacent OTX element, also works as a repressor for gene expression in the pineal cells. 4) Finally, this OTX site is necessary for expression repression in the bipolar cells in the retina.

Vertebrate retina contains two types of visual photoreceptor cells, rods and cones, the former responsible for dim light vision and the latter for bright light and color vision. The vertebrate visual opsins are classified into the following five phylogenetic types that originated before the vertebrate radiation: one produced in rod cells (RH1 3The abbreviations used are: RH1, rod opsin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LSC, long single cones; Crx, cone-rod homeobox; SSC, short single cones; PINE, pineal negative regulatory element; M/LWS, red-sensitive cone opsin, RH2, green-sensitive cone opsin; SWS2, blue-sensitive cone opsin; SWS1, UV-sensitive cone opsin; dpf, days post fertilization; LCR, locus control region. or rhodopsins) and the other four produced in cone cells with different spectral sensitivity, red (M/LWS), green (RH2), blue (SWS2), and UV types (SWS1) (1Yokoyama S. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 385-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The combined output from the different spectral types of the cones allows an animal to perceive color. Although the selective expression of an opsin gene in a given cone cell is a basis of forming color vision, its regulatory mechanism achieving the cell type specificity remains less understood compared with the mechanism of rod-specific expression studied for the RH1 type opsin gene (2Chen J.

Non-mammalian vertebrates have multiple extra-ocular photosensors, mainly localized in the pineal complex (4Oksche A. Ophthalmic Res. 1984; 16: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) that secretes melatonin under a regular day/night cycle, the phase of which can be shifted upon its photoreception (5Takahashi J.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Several nonvisual opsin genes have been found expressed in pineal cells of non-mammalian vertebrates, such as pinopsin (6Okano T. Yoshizawa T. Fukada Y. Nature. 1994; 372: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), exo-rhodopsin (exrho) (7Mano H. Kojima D. Fukada Y. Mol.

It has been found, however, that some visual opsin genes are also expressed in these pineal cells (9Okano T. Takanaka Y. Nakamura A. Hirunagi K. Adachi A. Ebihara S. Fukada Y. Mol.

Both the retina and the pineal organ are ontogenetically derived from the diencephalon and, in non-mammalian vertebrates, display many similarities in tissue and cellular morphology and biochemical properties (13Meissl H. Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, study of expression regulation of visual opsins, especially of cone opsins, is important for understanding not only the visual system but also the general photoreception system in vertebrates. The cone-rod homeobox (Crx) protein, a member of the Otx family of the paired-like homeodomain proteins, binds the OTX core consensus sequence (GATTA) and is one of a key trans-acting regulatory factor responsible for the gene expression in the retina and pineal organ (14Chen S.

Raymond P.A. Halpern M.E. Liang J.O. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although important, the Crx/Otx family alone is not sufficient for establishing the tissue- and cell-selective expression in the retina and pineal organ and presumably requires complex interactions with its variations of binding sites and other transcription factors (19Ng L.

The zebrafish is an ideal animal model for the study of tissue and cell selectivity of the opsin gene expression because it has a total of eight cone opsin genes with distinct spectral sensitivity in addition to the rod-specific RH1 and the pineal organ-specific exorh: the UV-sensitive SWS1, the blue-sensitive SWS2, the four green-sensitive RH2 subtypes (RH2-1, RH2-2, RH2-3, and RH2-4), and the two red-sensitive M/LWS subtypes (LWS-1 and LWS-2) (7Mano H.

Each cone opsin type is produced in a morphologically distinct type of cone cells in the retina as follows: SWS1 in the short single cones (SSCs), SWS2 in the long single cones (LSCs), the four RH2 subtypes in the short members of double cones, and the two M/LWS subtypes in the long members of double cones (23Raymond P.A.

But core elementary sequences remain to be specified in the cone opsin regulatory regions identified thus far, unlike the case of RH1 and exrho. Regarding exrho, a cis-acting element, designated PIPE, has been identified as a pineal organ-specific expression-promoting element, together with three Crx/Otx-binding sites, in its proximal 147-bp promoter (28Asaoka Y. Mano H. Kojima D. Fukada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15456-15461Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on the zebrafish blue-sensitive opsin gene, SWS2, which is a single-copy gene expressed in the LSCs in the retina. By taking the transgenic approach using the GFP reporter, we identified for the first time the cis-acting elements specific for a cone visual opsin gene and also found these elements to work repressively in other cell types in the retina, i.e. SSCs and bipolar cells, and in pineal cells, thus achieving tissue and cell specificity of the cone opsin expression. PAC Clone—Through the screening service of the RZPD German Resource Center for Genome Research of a zebrafish PAC library (number 706, originally created by C. Amemiya), a clone DNA (BUSMP706E19271Q9), designated SWS2-LWS-PAC-E here, was obtained using the LWS-2 cDNA as a probe (22Chinen A. Hamaoka T. Yamada Y. Kawamura S. Genetics. 2003; 163: 663-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which encompasses the SWS2, LWS-1, and LWS-2 in its ∼87-kb insert. The nucleotide sequence of the SWS2-LWS-PAC-E corresponds to the nucleotide position 22684531–22771857 of the chromosome 11 in the Ensembl zebrafish assembly version 7. GFP Expression Constructs and Microinjection—The pEGFP-1 plasmid (Clontech) was used as the source of the GFP gene to assemble GFP expression constructs. The 5′-flanking sequences of the zebrafish SWS2 were obtained by PCR from the SWS2-LWS-PAC-E clone in the cases of -5.2-, -3.5-, and -1.4-kb and -404-bp constructs (Fig. 1A). The -582- and the -300-bp constructs (Fig. 1A) were prepared by PCR from the -3.5-kb construct. The PCR primers were designed on the basis of the 5.2-kb 5′ sequence of the zebrafish SWS2 (30Luo W.

The -1.1-kb construct (Fig. 1A) was prepared by digesting the 3.5-kb construct with EcoRI. The coinjection DNA fragments in Fig. 1F were PCRed from the SWS2-LWS-PAC-E clone using the primers listed in Table S2.

The noncomplementary and transversion mutations were introduced into the SWS2up1.4kb:EGFP (Figs. 2 and 5A) by the site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene, Tokyo, Japan). All the mutagenized constructs were sequenced to confirm that no spurious mutation was incorporated to the insert DNA or to the GFP coding region. The deletions were introduced by PCR using the circular form of the SWS2up1.4kb:EGFP (Fig. 3A) and SWS2up5.2kb:EGFP (Fig. 4A) constructs as the template (see Table S3 and Table S4, respectively, for PCR primers) and were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The deletion constructs using the SWS2up1.4kb: EGFP were sequenced further to confirm the absence of spurious mutations in the insert DNA and the GFP coding region. The deletion constructs using the SWS2up5.2kb:EGFP were made twice by independent PCRs and the two PCR products were mixed to compensate for potential PCR errors. The EXRHOup147bp and PINE-OTX-EXRHOup147bp (Fig. 5B) were obtained by PCR from the zebrafish genomic DNA using primers listed in Table S5.FIGURE 2Involvement of the OTX sequences in the regulation of the zebrafish SWS2 expression.

The final concentration and the amount of the DNA constructs was adjusted to 50 ng/μl and 0.5–1 nl/embryo. The DNA constructs were microinjected to the cytoplasm of 1–2 cell stage of zebrafish embryos. At 7–8 days post-fertilization (dpf), the percentage of the eyes with GFP signal among all the eyes examined was taken as a measure of the efficiency of the transgene expression. The GFP-positive eyes were further distinguished into three levels by the number of GFP-positive cells per eye as follows: +++ (>50 cells), ++ (5–50 cells), and + (1–4 cells), as in previous studies (30Luo W.

Whereas the +++ and ++ were taken as a significant sign of the expression induction, the + was not. The selection of transgenic lines in the subsequent generations was performed as described previously (29Takechi M. Hamaoka T. Kawamura S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining was carried out for whole-mount retinas of 5–8 dpf larvae or adult retinal sections by following Luo et al. (30Luo W. Williams J. Smallwood P.M. Touchman J.W. Roman L.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Antibodies against zebrafish opsins raised in rabbits were provided by T. Vihtelic and D. Hyde (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, IN) (24Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Vis. Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and were used to stain cone photoreceptor cells. The Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody. Images of GFP and Cy3 fluorescence were captured using a Zeiss 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Genomic Region between 0.6 and 0.3 kb 5′ of Zebrafish Blue Opsin Gene SWS2 Contains the Necessary and Sufficient Regulatory Sequences for its LSC-specific Expression—A series of GFP reporters was constructed containing 5.2 kb to 300 bp 5′ of the zebrafish SWS2 gene from the initiation codon (Fig. 1A) and were subjected to microinjection. As shown in Fig. 1A, the injection of the GFP constructs with the 5.2-kb to 582-bp upstream regions resulted in a high level of GFP expression in the retina, with a tendency, however, that the number of positive cells decreased as the 5′ region used became shorter, suggesting that the region more upstream than ∼0.6 kb from the initiation codon contains enhancing sequences of the expression that are scattered in the upstream region redundantly. With the 404-bp upstream region, the GFP signal became scarce, and with the 300-bp region the GFP signal was not detectable. This suggests that the ∼0.3-kb region between 0.6 and 0.3 kb 5′ of SWS2 contains the region necessary for its expression. The immunostaining of the embryos at 7–8 dpf using the antibody against the zebrafish SWS2 opsin (24Vihtelic T.S. Doro C.J. Hyde D.R. Vis. Neurosci. 1999; 16: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) revealed that the cells with the GFP signals were indeed the LSCs that produce the SWS2 opsin (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the GFP expression to the LSCs in the retina was confirmed in four lines of transgenic zebrafish carrying the 5′ regions of 5.2-kb (Tg(zfSWS2–5.2A:EGFP)), 3.5-kb (Tg(zfSWS2–3.5A:EGFP)), 1.7-kb (Tg(zfSWS2–1.7A:EGFP)), and 1.1-kb (Tg(zfSWS2–1.1A:EGFP)). In these transgenic fish, seemingly all LSCs in the retina expressed GFP (Fig. 1, C–E). To test if the 0.3-kb region contains a sufficient regulatory region for gene expression in the LSCs, a coinjection protocol using mixed concatamers of separate DNA fragments formed upon integration into the genome (32Muller F. Williams D.W. Kobolak J. Gauvry L. Goldspink G. Orban L. Maclean N. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1997; 47: 404-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was employed. The -595/-282 and -497/-282 fragments of the zebrafish SWS2 upstream region were injected, respectively, together with a GFP construct to which the 853 bp 5′ of the zebrafish UV opsin gene SWS1 was attached (SWS1up853bp:EGFP (Fig. 1F)). The 853 bp contains the region necessary for SSC-specific expression (30Luo W. Williams J. Smallwood P.M. Touchman J.W. Roman L.M. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19286-19293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistently, our microinjection of the SWS1up853bp:EGFP alone resulted in appearance of GFP-positive cells in the retina, among which only less than 1% (3/335) appeared overlapped with the LSCs immunostained with the antibody against the zebrafish SWS2 opsin (Fig. 1F). The addition of the -595/-282 and -497/-282 fragments increased the proportion to 24% (93/382) and 15% (43/286), respectively. These results indicate that the 0.3-kb region between 0.6 and 0.3 kb 5′ of the SWS2 contains the region necessary and sufficient for its expression in LSCs. OTX Sequences in the SWS2 Promoter Are Involved in the LSC-specific Gene Expression—The 5.2-kb 5′ sequence of the zebrafish SWS2 contains 15 OTX sequences (GATTA or its reverse complement TAATC) (Fig. 1A), among which four (at -455, -430, -400, and -316) are clustered in the proximal 0.2-kb portion of the 0.3-kb region discussed above (Fig. 2). To examine if the four OTX sites are relevant to the LSC-specific gene expression, the OTX sequence GATTA was modified to TCGGC by site-directed mutagenesis in the GFP construct that the 1.4-kb upstream region was used (SWS2up1.4kb:EGFP) (Fig. 2). After the microinjection, the number of GFP-expressing cells in the retina was scored. When the mutation was introduced to a single OTX site among the four (OTXmut-1 to -4 in Fig. 2), expression level did not seem to be affected. When the mutation was introduced to two of the four sites (OTXmut-5 to -10), the GFP expression was nearly abolished in the cases where the most distal site (-455) was involved (OTXmut-7, -9, and -10) but not in the other three cases. When the mutation was introduced to three of the four sites (OTXmut-11 to -14), the GFP expression was nearly absent in all cases. We confirmed that all the GFP-expressing cells were the LSCs by immunostaining using the antibody against zebrafish SWS2 opsin (data not shown). These results suggest that the four OTX sites exert individually minor but synergistically significant promoting effects on the gene expression in the LSCs, with the distal-most site at -455 being most effective in the synergy. We introduced a series of deletions into the 0.3-kb region between 0.6 and 0.3 kb 5′ of SWS2 in the SWS2up1.4kb:EGFP (del-1 to -6 in Fig. 3A), injected the deletion constructs to zebrafish embryos, and scored the GFP expression. Consistent with the injection experiment using the OTX mutations, the deletion of the proximal 0.2-kb portion (Δ-497/-282; del-2 in Fig. 3A), containing all the four OTX sites, resulted in nearly complete loss of GFP expression. Also consistent with the result using the OTXmut-10 (Fig. 2) where the GFP expression was abolished, the deletions, including the distal two OTX sites (del-1, -2, -4, and -6) resulted in considerable reduction of GFP expression. On the other hand, deletion of the distal 100-bp portion (Δ-595/-498; del-3) had a less severe effect on the expression induction. These results suggest that the central 0.1-kb portion in the 0.3-kb region, containing distal two of the four OTX sites, plays a major role in promoting gene expression in the LSCs. SWS2 Promoter Contains the Expression Repressor for the UV-sensitive SSCs—Unexpectedly, deletion of the proximal 0.1-kb portion (Δ-404/-282; del-5 in Fig. 3A), containing the proximal two of the four OTX sites, of the 0.3-kb region resulted in not a decrease but a significant increase of GFP expression in the retina. The intensity of the fluorescence per cell also seemed higher than that by the control construct (data not shown). The immunostaining by the antibodies against the zebrafish opsins revealed that the GFP signals were not only from the LSCs but also from SSCs producing the SWS1 (UV) opsin (Fig. 3B). The GFP signal was not found in the other photoreceptor types, i.e. the rods, long members of double cones and short members of double cones producing the RH1 (rod), M/LWS (red), and RH2 (green) opsins, respectively. When five embryos were examined at 7–8 dpf, to which the del-5 construct was injected, 47% (335/715) of the GFP-expressing cells were LSCs in total, ranging from 38 to 53% among the five embryos (Fig. 3C). Another five embryos were examined for GFP expression in SSCs, and 62% (185/298) of t"

Although the integration time is functionally crucial, it remains elusive during network activity. While mechanisms of rapid processing are well documented in sensory systems, agility in motor systems has received little attention. Here we analyze how intense synaptic activity affects integration time in spinal motoneurons during functional motor activity and report a 10-fold decrease. As a result, action potentials can only be predicted from the membrane potential within 10 ms of their occurrence and detected for less than 10 ms after their occurrence. Being shorter than the average inter-spike interval, the AHP has little effect on integration time and spike timing, which instead is entirely determined by fluctuations in membrane potential caused by the barrage of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic activity. By shortening the effective integration time, this intense synaptic input may serve to facilitate the generation of rapid changes in movements."
https://openalex.org/W2085882081,"Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are gated by the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). Among them, Kir3 requires additional molecules, such as the βγ subunits of G proteins or intracellular sodium, for channel gating. Using an interactive computational-experimental approach, we show that sodium sensitivity of Kir channels involves the side chains of an aspartate and a histidine located across from each other in a crucial loop in the cytosolic domain, as well as the backbone carbonyls of two more residues and a water molecule. The location of the coordination site in the vicinity of a conserved arginine shown to affect channel–PtdIns(4,5)P2 interactions suggests that sodium triggers a structural switch that frees the crucial arginine. Mutations of the aspartate and the histidine that affect sodium sensitivity also enhance the channel's sensitivity to PtdIns(4,5)P2. Furthermore, on the basis of the molecular characteristics of the coordination site, we identify and confirm experimentally a sodium-sensitive phenotype in Kir5.1."
https://openalex.org/W1967403316,"The N-alpha-acetyltransferase NatB, composed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by the Nat3p and Mdm20p subunits, is an important factor for yeast growth and resistance to several stress agents. However, the expression and functional role of the mammalian counterpart has not yet been analysed. Here, we report the identification of Nat3p human homologue (hNAT5/hNAT3) and the characterization of its biological function. We found that hNAT5/hNAT3 silencing in HeLa cells results in inhibition of cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic agent MG132. Moreover, inhibition of hNAT5/hNAT3 expression induces p53 activation and upregulation of the antiproliferative protein p21(WAF1/CIP1). The changes of the cellular transcriptome after hNAT5/hNAT3 knockdown confirmed the involvement of this protein in cell growth and survival processes. Among the genes differentially expressed, we observed upregulation of several p53-dependent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic genes. In the c-myc transgenic mice, which is a model of inducible hepatocarcinoma, we found that hNAT5/hNAT3 was upregulated when the tumour was induced. In accordance with this observation, we noticed increased hNAT5/hNAT3 protein level in neoplastic versus non-neoplastic tissue in a high proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, our results suggest that hNAT5/hNAT3 is required for cellular proliferation and can be implicated in tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W1979605928,"Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, the c-Abl tyrosine kinase is released from cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins and then is targeted to the nucleus. Phosphorylation of Thr735 in c-Abl is critical for binding to 14-3-3; however, kinases responsible for this phosphorylation are unknown. Here, we identify CLK1, CLK4, MST1, MST2 and TTK (also known as Mps1) as novel Thr735 kinases in vitro by expression cloning strategy using phosphospecific antibody. We also demonstrate that ectopic expression of these kinases is capable for phosphorylation of Thr735 in cells. Importantly, upon exposure to oxidative stress, phosphorylation of Thr735 is transiently upregulated, and the status of this phosphorylation remains unchanged in cells silenced for CLK1, CLK4, MST1 or MST2. By contrast, knockdown of TTK attenuates phosphorylation of Thr735, suggesting that TTK is a physiological kinase that phosphorylates Thr735. In concert with these results, we show that, in cells silenced for TTK, c-Abl is accumulated in the nucleus even in unstressed condition and no further targeting into the nucleus occurs after oxidative stress. Moreover, nuclear entrapment of c-Abl by knocking down TTK enhances oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. These findings provide evidence that TTK phosphorylates c-Abl at Thr735 and that this phosphorylation is of importance to the cytoplasmic sequestration of c-Abl."
https://openalex.org/W2131720804,"An erroneous transcriptional process, known as molecular misreading, gives rise to an alternative transcript of the ubiquitin B (UBB) gene. This transcript encodes the protein UBB(+1), which comprises a ubiquitin moiety and a 19-aa C-terminal extension. UBB(+1) is found in affected neurons in neurodegenerative diseases and behaves as an atypical ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) proteasome substrate that is poorly degraded and impedes the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Here, we show that the limited length of UBB(+1) is responsible for its inefficient degradation and inhibitory activity. Designed UFD substrates with an equally short 19-aa or a 20-aa C-terminal extension were also poorly degraded and had a general inhibitory activity on the ubiquitin/proteasome system in two unrelated cell lines. Extending the polypeptide to 25 aa sufficed to convert the protein into an efficiently degraded proteasome substrate that lacked inhibitory activity. A similar length dependency was found for degradation of two UFD substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which suggests that the mechanisms underlying this length constraint are highly conserved. Extending UBB(+1) also converted this protein into an efficient substrate of the proteasome. These observations provide an explanation for the accumulation of UBB(+1) in neurodegenerative disorders and offers new insights into the physical constraints determining proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2054044100,"CYP3A4 is an important xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme. We previously found that CYP2C55 is highly up-regulated in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Here, we have further investigated the mechanism of regulation of CYP2C55 and other detoxifying systems in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Induction studies with prototypical inducers demonstrated an important role for the nuclear receptors PXR and CAR in the up-regulation of CYP2C55. Subsequent diet-switch experiments revealed that food-derived xenobiotics are primarily responsible for the increased induction of CYP2C55, as well as of several other primary detoxifying systems in Cyp3a(-/-) mice. Our data suggest that CYP3A normally metabolizes food-derived activators of PXR and/or CAR, explaining the increased levels of such activators in Cyp3a(-/-) mice and subsequent up-regulation of a range of detoxifying systems. Interestingly, our studies with tissue-specific CYP3A4 transgenic Cyp3a(-/-) mice revealed that not only hepatic but also intestinal expression of CYP3A4 could reduce the hepatic expression of detoxifying systems to near wild-type levels. Apparently, intestinal CYP3A4 can limit the hepatic exposure to food-derived activators of nuclear receptors, thereby regulating the expression of a range of detoxifying systems in the liver. This broad biological effect further emphasizes the importance of intestinal CYP3A activity and could have profound implications for the prediction of drug exposure."

Global inhibition of myeloid Src family kinase (SFK) activity with the broad-spectrum pyrrolo-pyrimidine inhibitor, A-419259, blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in CML cell lines, suggesting that transformation by Bcr-Abl requires SFK activity. However, the contribution of Hck and other individual SFKs to Bcr-Abl signaling is less clear. Here, we developed an A-419259-resistant mutant of Hck by replacing the gatekeeper residue (Thr-338; c-Src numbering) in the inhibitor-binding site with a bulkier methionine residue (Hck-T338M). This substitution reduced Hck sensitivity to A-419259 by more than 30-fold without significantly affecting kinase activity in vitro. Expression of Hck-T338M protected K-562 CML cells and Bcr-Abl-transformed TF-1 myeloid cells from the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of A-419259. These effects correlated with persistence of Hck-T338M kinase activity in the presence of the compound, and were accompanied by sustained Erk and Stat5 activation. In contrast, control cells expressing equivalent levels of wild-type Hck retained sensitivity to the inhibitor. We also show for the first time that A-419259 induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in primary CD34+ CML cells with equal potency to imatinib. These data suggest that Hck has a nonredundant function as a key downstream signaling partner for Bcr-Abl and may represent a potential drug target in CML."
https://openalex.org/W2058226155,"The serpinopathies are a group of inherited disorders that share as their molecular basis the misfolding and polymerization of serpins, an important class of protease inhibitors. Depending on the identity of the serpin, conditions arising from polymerization include emphysema, thrombosis, and dementia. The structure of serpin polymers is thus of considerable medical interest. Wild-type alpha(1)-antitrypsin will form polymers upon incubation at moderate temperatures and has been widely used as a model system for studying serpin polymerization. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and mass spectrometry, we have obtained molecular level structural information on the alpha(1)-antitrypsin polymer. We found that the flexible reactive center loop becomes strongly protected upon polymerization. We also found significant increases in protection in the center of beta-sheet A and in helix F. These results support a model in which linkage between serpins is achieved through insertion of the reactive center loop of one serpin into beta-sheet A of another. We have also examined the heat-induced conformational changes preceding polymerization. We found that polymerization is preceded by significant destabilization of beta-sheet C. On the basis of our results, we propose a mechanism for polymerization in which beta-strand 1C is displaced from the rest of beta-sheet C through a binary serpin/serpin interaction. Displacement of strand 1C triggers further conformational changes, including the opening of beta-sheet A, and allows for subsequent polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2165679784,"Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is a well-known inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, producing slow glutathione (GSH) depletion and oxidative stress; some ""responder"" cells avoid BSO-induced death by trans-activating the prosurvival protein Bcl-2. Here we show that BSO activates a noncanonical, inhibitory NF-kappaB- and p65-independent NF-kappaB pathway via a multistep process leading to the up-regulation of Bcl-2. The slow BSO-induced GSH depletion allows separation of two redox-related phases, namely, early thiol disequilibrium and late frank oxidative stress; each phase contributes to the progressive activation of a p50-p50 homodimer. The early phase, coinciding with substantial thiol depletion, produces a cytosolic preparative complex, consisting of p50 and its interactor Bcl-3 linked by interprotein disulfide bridges. The late phase, coinciding with reactive oxygen species production, is responsible, probably via p38 activation, for nuclear targeting of the complex and trans-activation of Bcl-2."

In search for potential regulators of Smad3 through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified casein kinase 1 gamma 2 (CKIγ2) as a novel Smad3-interacting protein. In mammalian cells, CKIγ2 selectively and constitutively binds Smad3 but not Smad1, -2 or -4. Functionally, CKIγ2 inhibits Smad3-mediated TGF-β responses including induction of target genes and cell growth arrest, and this inhibition is dependent on CKIγ2 kinase activity. Mechanistically, CKIγ2 does not affect the basal levels of Smad proteins or activity of the receptors. Rather, CKIγ2 preferentially promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of activated Smad3 through direct phosphorylation of its MH2 domain at Ser418. Importantly, mutation of Ser418 to alanine or aspartic acid causes an increase or decrease of Smad3 activity, respectively, in the presence of TGF-β. CKIγ2 is the first kinase known to mark activated Smad3 for destruction. Given its negative function in TGF-β signaling and its reported overexpression in human cancers, CKIγ2 may act as an oncoprotein during tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2111025707,"ABL family tyrosine kinases are tightly regulated by autoinhibition and phosphorylation mechanisms. These kinases maintain an inactive conformation through intramolecular interactions involving SH3 and SH2 domains. RIN1, a downstream effector of RAS, binds to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains and stimulates ABL tyrosine kinase activity. RIN1 binding to the ABL2 kinase resulted in a large decrease in Km and a small increase in Vmax toward an ABL consensus substrate peptide. The enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) was increased more than 5-fold by RIN1. In addition, RIN1 strongly enhanced ABL-mediated phosphorylation of CRK, PSTPIP1, and DOK1, all established ABL substrates but with unique protein structures and distinct target sequences. Importantly RIN1-mediated stimulation of ABL kinase activity was independent of activation by SRC-mediated phosphorylation. RIN1 increased the kinase activity of both ABL1 and ABL2, and this occurred in the presence or absence of ABL regulatory domains outside the SH3-SH2-tyrosine kinase domain core. We further demonstrate that a catalytic site mutation associated with broad drug resistance, ABL1T315I, remains responsive to stimulation by RIN1. These findings are consistent with an allosteric kinase activation mechanism by which RIN1 binding promotes a more accessible ABL catalytic site through relief of autoinhibition. Direct disruption of RIN1 binding may therefore be a useful strategy to suppress the activity of normal and oncogenic ABL, including inhibitor-resistant mutants that confound current therapeutic strategies. Stimulation through derepression may be applicable to many other tyrosine kinases autoinhibited by coupled SH3 and SH2 domains.

Chem. 2006; 281: 32714-32723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The described ABL functions are mediated by the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple actin remodeling regulator proteins including the adaptor proteins CRK and CRKL. These phosphorylation events are coordinated with the action of filamentous actin (F-actin) binding domains found at the carboxyl termini of both ABL proteins (for a review, see Ref. 11Hernandez S.E. Krishnaswami M. Miller A.L. Koleske A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 36-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in regulating cytoplasmic F-actin, ABL1 has a demonstrated nuclear function in the cellular response to DNA damage (for reviews, see Refs. 12Shaul Y. Ben-Yehoyada M. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and 13Wang J.Y. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase activity of ABL proteins is normally regulated at multiple levels. First an amino-terminal myristoylated peptide contributes to an inactive kinase domain conformation through multiple surface interactions (14Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D.

Second the ABL SH3 2The abbreviations used are: SH, SRC homology; TK, tyrosine kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: SH, SRC homology; TK, tyrosine kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. and SH2 domains cradle the kinase domain and stabilize a low activity conformation (16Nagar B.

Finally tyrosine residues in the ABL kinase domain are substrates for auto- and trans-phosphorylation events that increase ABL kinase activity (17Brasher B.B. Van Etten R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35631-35637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 18Dorey K. Engen J.R. Kretzschmar J. Wilm M. Neubauer G. Schindler T. Superti-Furga G.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In particular, SRC family kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a tyrosine in the ABL kinase domain activation loop stimulates activity severalfold. Recent work also suggests a role for regulatory serine phosphorylation of ABL proteins (21Jung J.H. Pendergast A.M. Zipfel P.A. Traugh J.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Each type of ABL kinase regulation appears to be conserved between ABL1 and ABL2. Both proteins can be amino-terminal myristoylated, and they show 90% sequence identity throughout the SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains. Regulatory tyrosine residues subject to trans-phosphorylation are especially well conserved. ABL kinase inhibitors such as STI571 (imatinib or Gleevec) bind within the catalytic site of the enzyme and stabilize an inactive conformation (22Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science (N. Y.). 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). These compounds are effective in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, which is characterized by expression of a translocation-derived BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. Unfortunately drug resistance often arises because of mutations within the kinase domain (23Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science (N. Y.). 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). These mutations block inhibitor binding while maintaining only slightly altered catalytic activity. Little is known, however, about how such catalytic site mutations affect regulation of kinase activity. RIN1 is a RAS effector protein that enhances the activation of ABL kinases. Overexpression of RIN1 increased cellular phosphotyrosine and specifically elevated the level of tyrosine phosphorylated CRKL, and this was accompanied by alterations in the actin cytoskeleton (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Conversely silencing of RIN1 by short hairpin RNA or deletion of RIN1 in a mouse model resulted in less basal tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous CRKL (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). RIN1 silencing and deletion were associated with enhanced cell attachment to fibronectin and reduced cell migration, similar to the effects caused by treatment with the ABL kinase inhibitor STI571 (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, RIN1 enhanced the transforming potential of BCR-ABL1 (25Afar D.E. Han L. McLaughlin J. Wong S. Dhaka A. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. Witte O.N. Colicelli J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that RIN1 is a physiological positive regulator of ABL kinase activity. Signaling from RIN1 to ABL is initiated by the binding of a proline-rich sequence on RIN1 to the SH3 domain of ABL (26Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This interaction leads to phosphorylation of RIN1 on tyrosine 36 and perhaps other amino-terminal tyrosines. RIN1 subsequently associates with the ABL SH2 domain (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). An appealing model links the resulting divalent interaction (RIN1 proline-rich motif and phospho-Tyr36 bound to the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains, respectively) with ABL kinase domain activation. Deletion of the ABL SH3 domain blocks RIN1 binding (25Afar D.E. Han L. McLaughlin J. Wong S. Dhaka A. Parmar K. Rosenberg N. Witte O.N. Colicelli J. Immunity. 1997; 6: 773-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and mutation of RIN1 amino-terminal tyrosines severely diminishes both ABL binding and kinase activation (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Hu H. Milstein M. Bliss J.M. Thai M. Malhotra G. Huynh L.C.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 11510-11516Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), consistent with this model. Together these observations suggested that RIN1 directly activates the tyrosine kinase activity of ABL proteins, but the mechanism of enzyme activation is unclear. Here we demonstrate that RIN1 directly alters the kinetic properties of ABL in a manner consistent with derepression of ABL SH3- and SH2-imposed autoinhibition. Strong stimulation of ABL kinase activity by RIN1 required no other cellular proteins and was observed with three independent well characterized substrates. Furthermore stimulation through RIN1 binding was independent of trans-phosphorylation by other kinases or regulation by distal ABL domains. We also demonstrate that a clinically relevant ABL catalytic site mutant retains responsiveness to RIN1, suggesting that kinase inhibitor-resistant mutants may be susceptible to inhibitors that block RIN1 binding. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—The baculovirus vector construct encoding ABL1-(1–531) with a carboxyl-terminal cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus protease and a hexahistidine tag (14Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D. Bornmann W. Clarkson B. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2003; 112: 859-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) was provided by Dr. John Kuriyan (University of California, Berkeley, CA). To create the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 334 of ABL1-(1–531) (equivalent to the BCR-ABL1T315I mutation), we first subcloned a fragment of ABL1-(1–531) from the amino-terminal BamHI site to the carboxyl-terminal EcoRI site into pFastBac1 digested with BamHI and HindIII using the linkers 5′-AATTCACTAGT-3′ and 5′-AGCTACTAGTG-3′ to connect the EcoRI and HindIII sites. A KpnI to AatII fragment from murine stem cell virus BCR-ABLT315I (generously provided by Dr. Charles Sawyers, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center) was then cloned into the pFastBac1-ABL1-(1–531). The transferred T315I mutation was confirmed by diagnostic digest (loss of a DdeI site) and sequence analysis. A baculovirus vector was used to produce human ABL2 with an amino-terminal hexahistidine tag attached to residues 74–1182 (natural carboxyl terminus) and has been described previously (20Tanis K.Q. Veach D. Duewel H.S. Bornmann W.G. Koleske A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Full-length human RIN1 cDNA with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag was subcloned into the pFastBac1 vector, and a full baculovirus construct was generated by recombination according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Protein Expression and Purification—The tagged ABL1-(1–531) and full-length RIN1 proteins were produced in Sf9 insect cells following infection with the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses. Cells were harvested in Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences) 48–72 h postinfection, then sonicated, and cleared at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The bacterial expression constructs His6-CRK, His6-PSTPIP1, and GST-DOK1 were kindly provided by Drs. Bruce Meyer, Stephen Goff, and Tony Hunter, respectively. The corresponding recombinant proteins were generated in transformed BL21 cells. Following induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm for 3 h), cells expressing CRK or PSTPIP1 were harvested in Lysis Buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole), whereas cells expressing DOK1 were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (at pH 7.4). Lysates were sonicated and cleared at 17,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. His-tagged recombinant proteins were captured by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), washed with Lysis Buffer, and eluted with Lysis Buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Glutathione S-transferase-tagged proteins were captured on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 mm reduced glutathione. The expression and isolation of unphosphorylated ABL2 from Sf9 cells has been described previously (20Tanis K.Q. Veach D. Duewel H.S. Bornmann W.G. Koleske A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Anti-ABL2 has been described previously (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Purified protein concentrations were determined by a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (280 nm), and the approximate percent purity was evaluated by SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Kinase Assays—All kinase reactions were performed under conditions in which total phosphorylation increased linearly with substrate concentration. A biotin-conjugated consensus ABL2 substrate peptide, biotin-AQDVYDVPPAKKK (Bioanalysis, Ltd.; sequence was verified by mass spectrometry), was used to characterize the kinetic parameters of ABL2. The peptide was preincubated with purified ABL2 and RIN1 proteins at the indicated concentrations in the reaction buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 10 mm MgCl2 on ice. The reaction was initiated by adding an ATP mixture to a final concentration of 50 μm ATP and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with a final reaction volume of 50 μl. It was stopped by adding 50 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, to each sample after 15-min incubation in a 30 °C water bath. ABL2 substrate peptide was selected by incubating with 25 μl of 50% avidin-agarose (Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with 250 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 50 μm ATP. The radioactivity bound to the beads was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Km and Vmax values were determined using a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot. The same data set was used to calculate kcat values based on an estimated molecular mass of 120 kDa for ABL2. For the other kinase assays, the reaction was initiated by adding ATP to a final concentration of 500 μm and was stopped by adding 10 μl of protein SDS loading buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Protein phosphorylation were detected by immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). A 10 mm stock of STI571 was prepared as described previously (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Analysis—Purified proteins (RIN1, CRK, and ABL2) were mixed in 250 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (RIN1 + ABL2 samples were first incubated in a 50-μl kinase reaction) and then precleared with 10 μl of 1:1 immobilized protein G-agarose (Pierce) at room temperature for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated with 1 μl of immunoprecipitation antibody and 25 μl of 1:1 immobilized protein G-agarose at room temperature for 1 h and then washed five times with buffer. Beads were resuspended and boiled in 25 μl of SDS protein loading buffer prior to immunoblot analysis. RIN1 Stimulates ABL Phosphorylation Kinetics—To quantify the effect of RIN1 binding on the kinetics of substrate phosphorylation by ABL tyrosine kinases, we carried out kinase assays using ABL2 and RIN1 purified from an insect cell expression system. Working within the linear range of enzyme activity, we observed a substantial increase in the phosphorylation of a consensus substrate peptide by ABL2 when RIN1 was added to the assay (Fig. 1). Using an appropriate range of substrate concentrations, we evaluated the contribution of RIN1 to ABL enzyme kinetics. Analysis revealed that RIN1 decreased the Km for substrate by more than 4-fold while causing a modest increase in Vmax (Table 1). The net result was a greater than 5-fold elevation in ABL2 catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). This is consistent with the model that ABL SH3 and SH2 domains function in part to inhibit the kinase domain and that engagement with RIN1 relieves this autoinhibition and increases ABL catalytic site accessibility to substrate.TABLE 1Kinetic data for RIN1 stimulation of ABL2 kinase activity (from data presented inFig. 1)Kinetic value-RIN1+RIN1Km (μm)235Vmax (pmol·min-1 mg-1)826945kcat (min-1)0.0990.113kcat/Km (min-1m-1)4,20023,000 Open table in a new tab RIN1 Stimulates ABL Phosphorylation of Multiple Substrates—The contribution of RIN1 to ABL-mediated phosphorylation of CRK, a well established substrate involved in actin remodeling, was examined next by in vitro kinase assay. RIN1 enhanced the kinase activity of ABL2 in a concentration-dependent manner up to an ∼40-fold increase over a control sample without RIN1 (Fig. 2A). Parallel assays using bovine serum albumin in place of RIN1 showed no stimulation of ABL kinase activity (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that this was not a nonspecific effect of total protein concentration. The observed enhancement of ABL-mediated CRK phosphorylation following the addition of RIN1 was consistent with the large increase in phospho-CRK associated with overexpression of RIN1 in cultured cells (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) but much greater than previously measured in vitro effects using a bacterially expressed fragment of RIN1 (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the CRK phosphorylation assays were performed using 50-fold less ABL2 than was needed for the peptide phosphorylation assays. The reduced requirement for kinase in the protein substrate assays likely reflected the contribution of enzyme-substrate interactions involving sequences distal to the immediate target site in the protein but absent in the peptide. Such interactions have been shown previously for ABL1 and CRK (29Ren R. Ye Z.S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Even accounting for this factor, it appeared that RIN1 stimulated the phosphorylation of CRK more than of substrate peptide. We noted that when using substantially higher concentrations of ABL2 (2 versus 0.2 nm) at the same concentration of CRK, the reaction proceeded much more rapidly, and the stimulatory effect of RIN1 was greatly diminished (data not shown). This is consistent with a positive regulatory role for RIN1 under limiting conditions as occur during cellular signaling. To determine whether RIN1 enhancement of ABL kinase activity extends to targets other than CRK, we examined two additional cytoplasmic substrates. ABL kinases phosphorylate the adapter protein DOK1 during cell spreading-induced actin remodeling (5Woodring P.J. Meisenhelder J. Johnson S.A. Zhou G.L. Field J. Shah K. Bladt F. Pawson T. Niki M. Pandolfi P.P. Wang J.Y. Hunter T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). DOK1 shows no similarity to CRK in overall sequence or domain structure, although the target phosphorylation sites in each substrate conform to an established consensus ((I/L/V)YX1–5(P/F) where Y is the phosphorylation site (30Cujec T.P. Medeiros P.F. Hammond P. Rise C. Kreider B.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar)). RIN1 enhanced the phosphorylation of DOK1 by ABL2, and this effect appeared to be similar in magnitude to that observed for the CRK substrate in a semiquantitative assay (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the kinase stimulatory effect of RIN1 is broad with respect to phosphorylation substrates. We continued this analysis by examining an established ABL substrate with a markedly different function. PSTPIP1 is an adaptor protein that recruits PEST motif tyrosine phosphatases to negatively regulate ABL (31Cong F. Spencer S. Cote J.F. Wu Y. Tremblay M.L. Lasky L.A. Goff S.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1413-1423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PSTPIP1 is structurally unrelated to CRK, except for an SH3 domain in each protein, or to DOK1. In addition, the phosphorylation site in PSTPIP1 deviates from the consensus ABL target found in both CRK and DOK1. Using kinase assay conditions identical to those used for CRK and DOK1, we observed a strong stimulatory effect of RIN1 on ABL2-mediated PSTPIP1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that the RIN1 stimulatory effect is not limited to protein substrates with consensus target sites. We considered whether RIN1 could bind directly to substrate proteins to facilitate access to the ABL kinase domain, but no evidence of this was observed (Fig. 2E). The previously documented interaction of RIN1 with ABL (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Han L. Wong D. Dhaka A. Afar D. White M. Xie W. Herschman H. Witte O. Colicelli J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4954-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) was clearly detected using these proteins, however (Fig. 2F). These results indicate that RIN1 binding and derepression of the ABL kinase domain promote the phosphorylation of a wide spectrum of substrates. The magnitude of kinase enhancement provided by RIN1 appeared to be stronger for PSTPIP1 than for CRK and DOK1 (Fig. 2, A, C, and D) in this semiquantitative assay, suggesting the possibility that RIN1 may provide features that cooperate with ABL-encoded substrate binding surfaces and might participate in substrate selectivity. The ABL1 and ABL2 proteins are extremely well conserved with greater than 90% amino acid identity throughout the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. When assayed under the same conditions, RIN1 activated an ABL1 construct similarly to what was observed for ABL2 (Fig. 3, A and B). It should be noted that although both the ABL1 and ABL2 constructs include the full SH3-SH2-TK domain segment, they differ in the presence or absence of other regions common to both family members (Fig. 3C). The strong stimulation of both ABL constructs suggests that RIN1 function requires neither the ABL amino-terminal peptide implicated in autoinhibition (missing in the ABL2 construct) nor the large ABL carboxyl-terminal segment that includes F-actin-binding sites and several regulatory motifs (missing in the ABL1 construct). Activation by RIN1 Is Independent of ABL Kinase Transphosphorylation—We next tested whether stimulation by RIN1 requires ABL kinase domain activation loop trans-phosphorylation by SRC family kinases. ABL2 prepared from Sf9 cells treated with a combination of kinase inhibitors showed no phosphorylation at Tyr439 in the activation loop, and more generally had no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation (Ref. 20Tanis K.Q. Veach D. Duewel H.S. Bornmann W.G. Koleske A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar and Fig. 4A). When used in the CRK phosphorylation assay, we observed only a slight reduction in the level of ABL kinase stimulation by RIN1 (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that trans-phosphorylation of the kinase domain, a well characterized mechanism of ABL activation, is not required prior to RIN1 binding and activation. However, these experiments cannot rule out the possible contribution of ABL autophosphorylation in RIN1-medated kinase stimulation. The Inhibitor-resistant Mutant ABL1T315I Remains RIN1-responsive—We next examined the RIN1 responsiveness of an ABL kinase mutated in the “gatekeeper” residue that resides between the ATP-binding site and a hydrophobic pocket (32Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Science (N. Y.). 2004; 303: 1800-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). This residue is altered in BCR-ABL1T315I, a mutant resistant to multiple kinase inhibitor drugs used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (23Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science (N. Y.). 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar), and in EGFRT790M, a mutant resistant to epidermal growth factor kinase inhibitors used for lung cancer (33Bell D.W. Gore I. Okimoto R.A. Godin-Heymann N. Sordella R. Mulloy R. Sharma S.V. Brannigan B.W. Mohapatra G. Settleman J. Haber D.A. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 1315-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL1T315I shows protein kinase activity that is comparable to BCR-ABL1 (less active with a peptide substrate) but had an altered cellular substrate profile (34Griswold I.J. MacPartlin M. Bumm T. Goss V.L. O'Hare T. Lee K.A. Corbin A.S. Stoffregen E.P. Smith C. Johnson K. Moseson E.M. Wood L.J. Polakiewicz R.D. Druker B.J. Deininger M.W. Mol. Cell.

Graeber T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19466-19471Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). BCR-ABL1T315I also has elevated phosphorylation of Tyr257, an ABL kinase domain P-loop residue implicated in regulation (35Skaggs B.J. Gorre M.E. Ryvkin A. Burgess M.R. Xie Y. Han Y. Komisopoulou E. Brown L.M. Loo J.A. Landaw E.M. Sawyers C.L. Graeber T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19466-19471Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We introduced the T315I mutation into an ABL1 clone, creating ABL1T315I (the actual position in wild type ABL1 isoform 1B is 334). Compared with the wild type enzyme, ABL1T315I showed strong resistance to the kinase inhibitor STI571 in an assay of CRK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). These assays were performed using high concentrations of ABL1 (5 nm), greatly reducing the need for positive regulation by RIN1 and allowing detection of CRK Tyr(P) in the absence of RIN1. We next carried out CRK phosphorylation assays at low ABL1 concentrations (0.5 nm), conditions under which the stimulatory effect of RIN1 is pronounced. Both wild type ABL1 and the ABL1T315I mutant were strongly activated by the presence of RIN1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). This result demonstrates that this kinase domain drug resistance mutation does not diminish the intrinsic requirement for RIN1 to achieve full ABL tyrosine kinase activity. The activity of ABL family non-receptor tyrosine kinases is tightly controlled by structural elements that impose and stabilize a low activity kinase domain conformation. Our results demonstrate that RIN1 directly activates ABL kinases through an increase in enzyme efficiency. This likely occurs through an allosteric change in ABL SH3 and SH2 domains upon binding of PXXP and Tyr(P) motifs, respectively, found in the previously defined ABL binding domain of RIN1 (24Hu H. Bliss J.M. Wang Y. Colicelli J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 815-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This model (Fig. 6) invokes a subsequent release of the kinase domain from a tight autoinhibitory fold imposed by its engagement with the SH3 and SH2 regulatory domains. Such a RIN1-induced conformational change may favor a more open and active ABL catalytic site with enhanced substrate access that is detected as a reduction in Km and an increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). Structural studies of the isolated ABL tyrosine kinase domain suggest that it may adopt distinct inactive structures that can interconvert (36Levinson N.M. Kuchment O. Shen K. Young M.A. Koldobskiy M. Karplus M. Cole P.A. Kuriyan J. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e144Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), providing an additional level of regulatory complexity. An extended SH3-SH2-TK domain conformation, with critical SH2-TK domain interactions, has been implicated in the stable activation of ABL (16Nagar B. Hantschel O. Seeliger M. Davies J.M. Weis W.I. Superti-Furga G. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 37Filippakopoulos P. Kofler M. Hantschel O. Gish G.D. Grebien F. Salah E.

Determining the detailed structure of RIN1 bound to ABL would provide valuable insight into the conformation of the physiologically activated kinase. Engagement of ABL SH3 and SH2 domains may not, per se, relieve conformational autoinhibition. An ABI1-derived peptide that binds both the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains weakly stimulated tyrosine kinase activity at low concentrations but strongly inhibited activity at higher concentrations (38Xiong X. Cui P. Hossain S. Xu R. Warner B. Guo X. An X. Debnath A.K. Cowburn D. Kotula L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Notably this inhibitory effect required peptide concentrations more than 1,000-fold above the concentration of full-length RIN1 protein used to stimulate kinase activity in our assays. Nonetheless it may well be that amino acids bordering the Tyr(P) and PXXP motifs could dramatically influence the magnitude and even the direction of kinase regulation. The stimulation of ABL tyrosine kinase activity by RIN1 appears to be independent of the autoinhibition imposed by the amino-terminal “cap” domain. This suggests either that RIN1 binding to the SH3 and SH2 domains overrides regulation by the cap peptide and myristoyl group or that these features are also engaged by the RIN1 protein through an uncharacterized interaction. In either case, the cap domain is clearly not required for RIN1-mediated stimulation. Transforming fusions of ABL, such as BCR-ABL1 and TEL-ABL2, have lost the cap domain, and this is believed to contribute to their elevated and constitutive kinase activity (39Franz W.M. Berger P. Wang J.Y. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, these oncoproteins retain the ABL SH3 and SH2 domains. This raises the possibility that these human leukemia oncoproteins may still be responsive to RIN1. Tyrosine phosphorylation by SRC family kinases leads to increased ABL kinase activity, and this signal transduction link contributes to stimulus-induced actin remodeling (18Dorey K. Engen J.R. Kretzschmar J. Wilm M. Neubauer G. Schindler T. Superti-Furga G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8075-8084Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 3884-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The ABL binding partner ABI1 inhibits kinase activity in part through blocking trans-phosphorylation (38Xiong X. Cui P. Hossain S. Xu R. Warner B. Guo X. An X. Debnath A.K. Cowburn D. Kotula L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), consistent with a physiological role for ABL kinase domain phosphoregulation. Importantly, however, the activation of ABL via RIN1 binding appears to be independent of ABL trans-phosphorylation by other tyrosine kinases. This result suggests that conformational derepression and post-translational activation of the ABL kinase domain are uncoupled and implies that ABL kinases are responsive to distinct and non-overlapping regulatory signals. We cannot rule out, of course, the possible dependence of RIN1 on other ABL regulation mechanisms such as autophosphorylation, which was not examined here. Although much effort has focused on mechanisms regulating the intensity of kinase activity, it is equally important to consider the potential influence of regulators on substrate specificity. For ABL tyrosine kinases, synthetic peptide selection initially identified preferred target sites with proline at position +3 or +4 (40Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar) with subsequent studies leading to the broader consensus (I/L/V)YX1–5(P/F) (30Cujec T.P. Medeiros P.F. Hammond P. Rise C. Kreider B.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Large scale proteomics analysis of BCR-ABL1-expressing cells also showed significant overrepresentation of YX1–5(P/F) sites (41Goss V.L. Lee K.A. Moritz A. Nardone J. Spek E.J. MacNeill J. Rush J. Comb M.J. Polakiewicz R.D. Blood. 2006; 107: 4888-4897Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These and other (42Amoui M. Miller W.T. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) observations support a strong preference, although not a requirement, for a downstream proline. The fact that RIN1 enhanced ABL-mediated phosphorylation of substrates with a consensus site (CRK = pYAQPSVN where pY is phosphotyrosine) or a non-consensus site (PSTPIP1 = pYTAIAVQ) suggests that RIN1 increases ABL catalytic site accessibility for a wide range of substrates but does not rule out a potential contribution of RIN1 to substrate selectivity. A large component of kinase substrate specificity can be provided by interactions peripheral to the target and catalytic sites. Mitogen-activated protein kinases, such as ERK1 and ERK2, refine their substrate selectivity by combining a low complexity target site with a distal docking site recognized by the enzyme (43Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 44Jacobs D. Glossip D. Xing H. Muslin A.J. Kornfeld K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2893-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). RIN1 might possibly contribute a port for an as yet uncharacterized substrate docking site. Such a mechanism could lead to both enhanced kinase activity and refined substrate recruitment. Further studies will be needed to determine the identity of any such docking sites. The BCR-ABL1T315I mutant has been found in chronic myeloid leukemia patients before exposure to kinase inhibitors (46Shah N.P. Nicoll J.M. Nagar B. Gorre M.E. Paquette R.L. Kuriyan J. Sawyers C.L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar) and is associated with relapse in patients treated with imatinib and related ABL kinase inhibitors (23Gorre M.E. Mohammed M. Ellwood K. Hsu N. Paquette R. Rao P.N. Sawyers C.L. Science (N. Y.). 2001; 293: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2725) Google Scholar). The fact that the ABL1T315I mutant retains responsiveness to RIN1 is consistent with a model in which binding of RIN1 to the SH3 and SH2 domains promotes substrate access to the ABL catalytic site and suggests that BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutants selected for drug resistance may still be vulnerable to inhibitors targeted outside the catalytic domain. Disruption of the interaction between RIN1 and ABL1 might also synergize with ABL catalytic site inhibition to reduce the rate of relapse in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. The characterization of RIN1, a known RAS effector, as a potent direct positive regulator of ABL proteins suggests that RAS signaling can be channeled through a RAS-RIN1-ABL pathway. The majority of non-receptor tyrosine kinases have coupled SH3-SH2 domains as in ABL1 and ABL2. Our findings therefore raise the possibility that RIN1 may be representative of a larger class of tyrosine kinase conformational activators that cause derepression through direct binding of autoinhibitory SH3-SH2 domains to regulate cytoplasmic signaling. Interference with such activators could prove highly useful in efforts to redirect, dampen, or block tyrosine kinase function. We thank Joanne M.

https://openalex.org/W2021080421,"Cathelicidins, a group of vertebrate- specific immune effector molecules, developed into a multigene family through gene duplication in the Cetartiodactyla lineage, in which structural changes of the antimicrobial domains (AMDs) among paralogs during evolution are clearly associated with functional diversification of cathelicidins. However, the evolutionary mechanism for such structural diversity remains largely unsolved. Although at the genomic level, the 3'-exon alone encoding the variable AMD repertoire would favor a role of exon shuffling, the observation that two structurally unrelated subfamilies of AMDs (protegrins and prophenins) display high similarity in some nucleotide regions of the 3'-exons of their genes provides evidence for postduplication sequence remodeling. This opinion is further strengthened by finding a proline-arginine-rich antibacterial peptide of 38 residues (named PR-38) encoded by an open reading frame located in the 3' untranslated region of protegrins, which is in frame with prophenins. The latter appears to have undergone internal motif repeats in the region corresponding to PR-38. PR-38 exhibits similar amino acid sequence and carboxyl-terminal amidation feature to PR-39s, a subfamily of cathelicidin peptides conserved across Cetartiodactyla. Functional assays of the chemically synthesized PR-38 confirmed its antibacterial activity with a similar action mode to PR-39 against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at micromolar concentrations, supporting an ancient functional link among cathelicidin members belonging to different subfamilies. Resurrecting the fossil peptide highlights the evolutionary position of PR-39 in generating structurally variable subfamilies of porcine cathelicidins through postduplication sequence remodeling."

Studies conducted in our laboratory showed that the molecular mass of GST π is decreased by the addition of potassium bromide, implying that electrostatic interactions are important forces holding the subunits together (23Ralat L.A.

These residues are sufficiently close to participate in intra- and intersubunit electrostatic interactions that can influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium of the enzyme. Fig. 2 shows an expanded view of these amino acids. The distance between Arg-74 of subunit A and Asp-90 of the subunit B is only 3.0 Å (Fig. 2A), whereas the closest distance between the two carboxylate oxygens of Asp-94 of subunit A and the guanidinium group of Arg-70 of subunit B is 4.6 Å (Fig. 2B). In addition, Thr-67 of subunit A is only 2.9 Å from the carboxylate oxygens of Asp-94 of subunit B (Fig. 2B), a distance consistent with hydrogen bonding between these amino acids. The two arginines and two aspartates are conserved among GSTs of the π class from other mammals, although Thr-67 is not, as represented by the sequence alignment shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 2An enlargement of the wild-type human GST π interface showing interacting residues between the two subunits.

Arg-74, Asp-90, Arg-70, Asp-94, and Thr-67 were selected as target sites for mutagenesis because of their proximity to the subunit interface. In addition, we address the question of whether the dimeric form of GST π is required for activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—GSH, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), ampicillin, dithiothreitol, and buffer components were purchased from Sigma Co. Ni-NTA resin and the QuikChange-XL kit were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). The plasmid DNA purification kit was supplied by Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Human thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Lab, Inc. (South Bend, IN). CM-cellulose (CM-52) was supplied by Whatman Inc. (Clifton, NJ).Plasmid and Mutagenesis—The cDNA encoding human GST P1-1 was inserted into pET-15b vector, which contains a thrombin cleavable hexahistidine N-terminal tag (24Chang M. Bolton J.L. Blond S.Y. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 17: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All mutant enzymes were generated using the QuikChange-XL kit. The oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were as follows: T67A forward primer (5′-C CAG TCC AAT GCC ATC CTG CGT CAC CTG G) and its complement; R70Q forward primer (5′-CC AAT ACC ATC CTG CAG CAC CTG GGC CG) and its complement; R74Q forward primer (5′-G CGT CAC CTG GGC CAG ACC CTT GGG) and its complement; D90N forward primer (5′-GCA GCC CTG GTG AAC ATG GTG AAT GAC G) and its complement; D94N forward primer (5′-G GAC ATG GTG AAT AAC GGC GTG GAC C) and its complement. The underlined codons are for mutated amino acids. DNA extraction and purification were performed using a QIAgen Spin Miniprep Kit. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing performed on an ABI Prism model 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems) at the center for Agricultural Biotechnology, University of Delaware.Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant Enzyme—All His tag wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli cells. In each case, the cell cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 24 h. The cell cultures were then centrifuged and collected, as described previously (25Vargo M.A. Nguyen L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These His tag enzymes were purified using an Ni-NTA column (25Vargo M.A. Nguyen L. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3327-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this method, the cell pellet of wild-type or mutant enzyme was sonicated, and the supernatant was applied to the Ni-NTA column (12 ml of resin) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A). The column was eluted first with Buffer A, followed by Buffer B (Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole). The enzyme was eluted at ∼50 mm imidazole using a linear gradient of imidazole (20-200 mm) in buffer A (100 ml of each buffer). The fractions exhibiting activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA.For some experiments the His tag was cleaved by thrombin and then purified using a CM-52 ion-exchange column. In this procedure, the His tag enzyme was incubated with thrombin (40 units/mg GST protein) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 25 °C for 2 h. Separation of non-His tag GST and thrombin was achieved by applying the digest to a CM-52 column equilibrated with 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The isoelectric point of thrombin (7.5) is much higher than that of GST π (5.6); at pH 7.2, the negatively charged cleaved GST is eluted in the column wash, whereas the positively charged thrombin binds to the negatively charged carboxymethyl-cellulose column. The fractions of relatively high GST activity were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed into 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA.The purity of His tag and non-His tag enzymes was assessed by SDS-PAGE (26Soundar S. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5264-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and N-terminal sequencing. N-terminal amino acid sequencing was conducted on an Applied Biosystems instrument (Model Procise) equipped with an on-line microgradient delivery system (Model 140C) and a computer (Model 610 Macintosh). All the purified enzymes were stored in aliquots at −80 °C.Enzyme Assays—As a standard assay, the enzymatic activity was monitored continuously by the formation of the conjugate of glutathione (GSH) (2.5 mm in assay) and CDNB (3 mm) at 340 nm (Δϵ = 9.6 mm-1cm-1) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1 mm EDTA at 25 °C (27Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All assays contained 2.5% ethanol, which facilitates the solubility of CDNB. The measured enzymatic activity was corrected for the nonenzymatic reaction between GSH and CDNB. To determine the apparent Km for GSH, the concentration of GSH was varied (generally, 0.02 to 20 mm), whereas the concentration of CDNB was held constant at 3 mm in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. Similarly, to determine the apparent Km for CDNB, a range of CDNB concentration was used (0.05 to 3 mm), while the GSH concentration was maintained at saturating concentrations (2.5-60 mm). The Km and Vmax values were determined from direct plots of velocity versus substrate concentration using SigmaPlot software, and are presented along with their standard errors. The enzyme concentrations used in the assays are given in the tables.CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra of non-His tag and His tag wild-type and mutant enzymes were recorded using an Aviv CD spectrometer, Model 400. All enzymes (∼0.3 mg/ml) were scanned five times, averaged, and the background from buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer and 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) was subtracted from each spectrum. Ellipticity was measured as a function of wavelength from 250 to 200 nm at 2 nm increments using a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm path length. The mean molar ellipiticity (θ) (deg cm2dmol-1) was calculated from the equation, (θ) = θ/(10 nCl), where θ is the measured ellipticity in millidegrees, C is the molar concentration of subunit, l is the path length in centimeters, and n is the number of amino acids per subunit (215 and 231 for non-His tag and His tag GST π, respectively). The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay, based on the Bradford method, with the homogeneous wild-type GST π as the protein standard (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar).Molecular Mass Determination by Light Scattering—Molecular masses of wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined using light scattering (miniDAWN laser photometer from Wyatt Technology). Buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5) and all enzymes (0.02-1.2 mg/ml) were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter before being used. Because of possible changes in the concentration during filtration, the protein concentration (measured by the Bio-Rad assay, as described above) was determined on the sample used for light scattering after removal from the cuvette. Data were collected and analyzed using ASTRA for Windows.Atomic Force Microscopy—Protein was imaged on a cleaned polylysine-coated glass slide. AFM images were obtained on a BioScope II (Veeco Instruments) in conjunction with an inverted optical microscope (Axiovert, Zeiss, Germany) operated in contact mode in fluid. Protein samples (10 μl of enzyme at 0.25 mg/ml) were incubated with 5 μl of 2.5% glutaraldehyde solution in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, at room temperature for 15 min on the treated glass slides. Samples were then washed with phosphate buffer (100 μl) before imaging (29Adams E.L. Kroon P.A. Williamson G. Gilbert H.J. Morris V. Carbohydrate Res. 2004; 339: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Silicon-nitride probes (MLCT, Veeco Probes) with a nominal spring constant of 0.01 newton/m were used for imaging under phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were flattened using first order flattening and analyzed as described below.Molecular Mass Determination from AFM Images—Cross-sections (width, w, and height, h) of individual protein molecules were measured using the AFM software (Nanoscope version 7.20). The radius (r) is dependent on the width (w) and is calculated by the equation 1, r = w2/16R, (where r = 30 nm, and is a property of the geometry of the scanning tip). These images were analyzed for molecular volume in accordance with equation 2, Vm = (h/6) (3r2 + h2), which in turn was used to determine the molecular weight of the sample. Briefly, cross-sections were taken of individual proteins and compared with a standard curve of proteins of known molecular weight (29Adams E.L. Kroon P.A. Williamson G. Gilbert H.J. Morris V. Carbohydrate Res. 2004; 339: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Schneider S.W. Larmer J. Henderson R.M. Oberleithner H. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 435: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Molecular Modeling—Models were generated using the Insight II modeling software from Molecular Simulations, Inc. on an Indigo 2 workstation from Silicon Graphics. The model was based on the crystal structure of human GST π (PDB #9GSS) in complex with S-hexylglutathione. The figures illustrating the models were prepared using ICM software from Molsoft LLC (La Jolla, CA).RESULTSExpression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant GST π—The plasmid encoding human GST π with a thrombin-cleavable hexahistidine N-terminal tag was transformed and expressed in BL21 E. coli cells. The His tag enzymes were purified on an Ni-NTA column, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Enzymes were purified to homogeneity, yielding a single protein by N-terminal protein sequencing. The N-terminal sequence of GSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLEPPYTVVYEFP confirmed the presence of the thrombin cleavable hexahistidine (underlined amino acids) before the N-terminal of GST π (PPYTVV—). The purity and identity of His tag enzymes were also evaluated by SDS-PAGE. A single distinct band, corresponding to the molecular mass of 25.5 kDa, was observed for wild-type and mutant enzymes (data not shown). These results demonstrate that all His tag enzyme preparations contained a single protein.The non-His tag enzyme was obtained by first digesting the isolated His tag enzyme with thrombin and then purifying it on a CM-52 column at pH 7.2, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” N-terminal sequencing of each purified enzyme indicated the presence of one protein with the correct N-terminal sequence of GSHMLEPPY; the underlined amino acids before the N terminus of GST π (PPY) are the amino acid residues that follow the thrombin cleavage site. The results from SDS-PAGE confirmed the purity and identity of these enzymes: only a single band was observed for each enzyme, corresponding to the correct molecular mass of 23.5 kDa for the non-His tag wild-type and mutant class π GSTs (data not shown). The total yield of GST π purified by these methods was five to ten times higher than that obtained by the earlier procedures (16Ralat L.A. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12491-12499Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 17Ralat L.A. Colman R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50204-50213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The enzyme yield varies with the mutation; typically 100 mg/liter cell culture was obtained for the wild-type enzyme and 50-100 mg/liter cell culture for the mutant enzymes.CD Spectra of Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes—CD spectra of all non-His tag and His tag GSTs were measured to evaluate whether the mutations cause changes in the secondary structure. The spectra were determined using protein concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 4, the CD spectra of all non-His tag mutant enzymes were very similar to that of non-His tag wild-type enzyme. The CD spectrum of non-His tag wild-type GST π is superimposable on that of His tag wild-type enzyme, indicating that there is no detectable difference in secondary structure between these two forms of the enzyme. In addition, the CD spectra of all His tag mutant enzymes were the same as that of the His tag wild-type enzyme (data not shown). These results indicate that the mutations at the electrostatic interface do not cause appreciable changes in the enzyme's secondary structure.FIGURE 4CD spectra were determined with the protein (0. 3 mg/ml) in 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA.

The corresponding values for R70Q, R74Q, D90N, and D94N mutant enzymes were greatly decreased.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters at pH 6.5 for non-His-tag wild type and mutant human GST π enzymesEnzymeSpecific activityaThe standard assay solution contains 2.5 mm GSH, 3 mm CDNB, and 1 mm EDTA in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) in a total volume of 1 ml at 25 °C.Protein concentration in assayVmaxbVmax and Km values were determined by extrapolation to infinite concentration of the GSH, while maintaining (CDNB) at 3 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, using SigmaPlot for data analysis.Km GSHbVmax and Km values were determined by extrapolation to infinite concentration of the GSH, while maintaining (CDNB) at 3 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, using SigmaPlot for data analysis.Km CDNBcKm values were determined by varying the concentration of CDNB (0.05-3 mm), while the GSH concentration was maintained at concentrations (2.5-60 mm), which are 10 to 20 times the Km GSH for that enzyme.

https://openalex.org/W2033013637,"The Rad9–Rad1–Hus1 (9-1-1) cell cycle checkpoint complex plays a key role in the DNA damage response. Cells with a defective 9-1-1 complex have been shown to be sensitive to apoptosis induced by certain types of genotoxic stress. However, the mechanism linking the loss of a functional 9-1-1 complex to the cell death machinery has yet to be determined. Here, we report that etoposide treatment dramatically upregulates the BH3-only proteins, Bim and Puma, in Hus1-deficient cells. Inhibition of either Bim or Puma expression in Hus1-knockout cells confers significant resistance to etoposide-induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of both proteins results in further resistance, suggesting that Bim and Puma cooperate in sensitizing Hus1-deficient cells to etoposide treatment. Moreover, we found that Rad9 collaborates with Bim and Puma to sensitize Hus1-deficient cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, Rad9 localizes to chromatin in Hus1-wild-type cells, whereas in Hus1-deficient cells, it is predominantly located in the cytoplasm where it binds to Bcl-2. Taken together, these results suggest that loss of Hus1 sensitizes cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis not only by inducing Bim and Puma expressions but also by releasing Rad9 into the cytosol to augment mitochondrial apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2077306158,"Given that macrophages can proliferate and that certain microbes survive inside phagocytic cells, the question arises as to the post-mitotic distribution of microbial cargo. Using macrophage-like cells we evaluated the post-mitotic distribution of intracellular Cryptococcus yeasts and polystyrene beads by comparing experimental data to a stochastic model. For beads, the post-mitotic distribution was that expected from chance alone. However, for yeast cells the post-mitotic distribution was unequal, implying preferential sorting to one daughter cell. This mechanism for unequal distribution was phagosomal fusion, which effectively reduced the intracellular particle number. Hence, post-mitotic intracellular particle distribution is stochastic, unless microbial and/or host factors promote unequal distribution into daughter cells. In our system unequal cargo distribution appeared to benefit the microbe by promoting host cell exocytosis. Post-mitotic infectious cargo distribution is a new parameter to consider in the study of intracellular pathogens since it could potentially define the outcome of phagocytic-microbial interactions."
