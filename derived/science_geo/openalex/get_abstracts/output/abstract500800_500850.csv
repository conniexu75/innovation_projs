https://openalex.org/W1692771265,"The fine control afforded by trapped atomic ions is used to explore experimentally how the range of interactions between the ions influences the spreading of information in quantum many-body systems. The speed at which information propagates in quantum many-body systems determines the overall behaviour of these systems. If the interactions between the system components are short-ranged, the dynamics are well understood and relatively straightforward to compute. Less clear is what happens when long-range interactions are present. Now two groups have used the exquisite control afforded by trapped atomic ions to explore experimentally how the interaction range influences the time evolution of quantum many-body systems. The key to explaining and controlling a range of quantum phenomena is to study how information propagates around many-body systems. Quantum dynamics can be described by particle-like carriers of information that emerge in the collective behaviour of the underlying system, the so-called quasiparticles1. These elementary excitations are predicted to distribute quantum information in a fashion determined by the system’s interactions2. Here we report quasiparticle dynamics observed in a quantum many-body system of trapped atomic ions3,4. First, we observe the entanglement distributed by quasiparticles as they trace out light-cone-like wavefronts5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Second, using the ability to tune the interaction range in our system, we observe information propagation in an experimental regime where the effective-light-cone picture does not apply7,12. Our results will enable experimental studies of a range of quantum phenomena, including transport13,14, thermalization15, localization16 and entanglement growth17, and represent a first step towards a new quantum-optic regime of engineered quasiparticles with tunable nonlinear interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2003464774,"The maximum speed with which information can propagate in a quantum many-body system directly affects how quickly disparate parts of the system can become correlated and how difficult the system will be to describe numerically. For systems with only short-range interactions, Lieb and Robinson derived a constant-velocity bound that limits correlations to within a linear effective light cone. However, little is known about the propagation speed in systems with long-range interactions, since the best long-range bound is too loose to give the correct light-cone shape for any known spin model and since analytic solutions rarely exist. In this work, we experimentally determine the spatial and time-dependent correlations of a far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body system evolving under a long-range Ising- or XY-model Hamiltonian. For several different interaction ranges, we extract the shape of the light cone and measure the velocity with which correlations propagate through the system. In many cases we find increasing propagation velocities, which violate the Lieb-Robinson prediction, and in one instance cannot be explained by any existing theory. Our results demonstrate that even modestly-sized quantum simulators are well-poised for studying complicated many-body systems that are intractable to classical computation."
https://openalex.org/W2162454135,"N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are Hebbian-like coincidence detectors, requiring binding of glycine and glutamate in combination with the relief of voltage-dependent magnesium block to open an ion conductive pore across the membrane bilayer. Despite the importance of the NMDA receptor in the development and function of the brain, a molecular structure of an intact receptor has remained elusive. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of the Xenopus laevis GluN1-GluN2B NMDA receptor with the allosteric inhibitor, Ro25-6981, partial agonists and the ion channel blocker, MK-801. Receptor subunits are arranged in a 1-2-1-2 fashion, demonstrating extensive interactions between the amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains. The transmembrane domains harbour a closed-blocked ion channel, a pyramidal central vestibule lined by residues implicated in binding ion channel blockers and magnesium, and a ∼twofold symmetric arrangement of ion channel pore loops. These structures provide new insights into the architecture, allosteric coupling and ion channel function of NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2063135302,"Human pluripotent stem cells hold potential for regenerative medicine, but available cell types have significant limitations. Although embryonic stem cells (ES cells) from in vitro fertilized embryos (IVF ES cells) represent the 'gold standard', they are allogeneic to patients. Autologous induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) are prone to epigenetic and transcriptional aberrations. To determine whether such abnormalities are intrinsic to somatic cell reprogramming or secondary to the reprogramming method, genetically matched sets of human IVF ES cells, iPS cells and nuclear transfer ES cells (NT ES cells) derived by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) were subjected to genome-wide analyses. Both NT ES cells and iPS cells derived from the same somatic cells contained comparable numbers of de novo copy number variations. In contrast, DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of NT ES cells corresponded closely to those of IVF ES cells, whereas iPS cells differed and retained residual DNA methylation patterns typical of parental somatic cells. Thus, human somatic cells can be faithfully reprogrammed to pluripotency by SCNT and are therefore ideal for cell replacement therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2131949595,"The rise of smartphones and web services made possible the large-scale collection of personal metadata. Information about individuals' location, phone call logs, or web-searches, is collected and used intensively by organizations and big data researchers. Metadata has however yet to realize its full potential. Privacy and legal concerns, as well as the lack of technical solutions for personal metadata management is preventing metadata from being shared and reconciled under the control of the individual. This lack of access and control is furthermore fueling growing concerns, as it prevents individuals from understanding and managing the risks associated with the collection and use of their data. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we describe openPDS, a personal metadata management framework that allows individuals to collect, store, and give fine-grained access to their metadata to third parties. It has been implemented in two field studies; (2) we introduce and analyze SafeAnswers, a new and practical way of protecting the privacy of metadata at an individual level. SafeAnswers turns a hard anonymization problem into a more tractable security one. It allows services to ask questions whose answers are calculated against the metadata instead of trying to anonymize individuals' metadata. The dimensionality of the data shared with the services is reduced from high-dimensional metadata to low-dimensional answers that are less likely to be re-identifiable and to contain sensitive information. These answers can then be directly shared individually or in aggregate. openPDS and SafeAnswers provide a new way of dynamically protecting personal metadata, thereby supporting the creation of smart data-driven services and data science research."
https://openalex.org/W2147975845,"Dengue fever (DF) is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. In this decade it has expanded to new countries and from urban to rural areas. Nepal was regarded DF free until 2004. Since then dengue virus (DENV) has rapidly expanded its range even in mountain regions of Nepal, and major outbreaks occurred in 2006 and 2010. However, no data on the local knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of DF in Nepal exist although such information is required for prevention and control measures.We conducted a community based cross-sectional survey in five districts of central Nepal between September 2011 and February 2012. We collected information on the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and their knowledge, attitude and practice regarding DF using a structured questionnaire. We then statistically compared highland and lowland communities to identify possible causes of observed differences.Out of 589 individuals interviewed, 77% had heard of DF. Only 12% of the sample had good knowledge of DF. Those living in the lowlands were five times more likely to possess good knowledge than highlanders (P<0.001). Despite low knowledge levels, 83% of the people had good attitude and 37% reported good practice. We found a significantly positive correlation among knowledge, attitude and practice (P<0.001). Among the socio-demographic variables, the education level of the participants was an independent predictor of practice level (P<0.05), and education level and interaction between the sex and age group of the participants were independent predictors of attitude level (P<0.05).Despite the rapid expansion of DENV in Nepal, the knowledge of people about DF was very low. Therefore, massive awareness programmes are urgently required to protect the health of people from DF and to limit its further spread in this country."
https://openalex.org/W1980939996,"In recent years, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play key roles in tumorgenesis. However, the contributions of lncRNAs to cervical cancer (CC) remain largely unknown. In this study, differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in cervical cancer and paired peritumoral tissues were detected by transcriptome microarray analysis. We found 708 probe sets of lncRNAs increased and 836 probe sets decreased in CC tissues, while 1288 mRNA differential probe sets increased and 901 mRNA probe sets decreased. The results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Then, we found a specific differentially expressed lncRNA can physically bind to enhancer of zeste homolog2 (EZH2) by using RNA immunoprecipitation. We termed it as EZH2-binding lncRNA in cervical cancer [lncRNA-EBIC]. Wound healing assays and Matrigel invasion assays were used to determine the function of this lncRNA by silencing it. We observed that the migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells in vitro were inhibited upon suppression of lncRNA-EBIC by siRNA. We also found that the association between lncRNA-EBIC and EZH2 was required for the repression of E-cadherin, which was a key molecular in the metastasis of cervical cancer. Conclusion These results demonstrated that lncRNA-EBIC was an oncogenic lncRNA, which could promote tumor cell invasion in CC by binding to EZH2 and inhibiting E-cadherin expression."
https://openalex.org/W1999342657,"Myocardial ischemia and cardioprotection by ischemic pre-conditioning induce signal networks aimed at survival or cell death if the ischemic period is prolonged. These pathways are mediated by protein post-translational modifications that are hypothesized to cross-talk with and regulate each other. Phosphopeptides and lysine-acetylated peptides were quantified in isolated rat hearts subjected to ischemia or ischemic pre-conditioning, with and without splitomicin inhibition of lysine deacetylation. We show lysine acetylation (acetyl-Lys)-dependent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, AKT, and PKA kinases during ischemia. Phosphorylation and acetyl-Lys sites mapped onto tertiary structures were proximal in >50% of proteins investigated, yet they were mutually exclusive in 50 ischemic pre-conditioning- and/or ischemia-associated peptides containing the KXXS basophilic protein kinase consensus motif. Modifications in this motif were modeled in the C terminus of muscle-type creatine kinase. Acetyl-Lys increased proximal dephosphorylation by 10-fold. Structural analysis of modified muscle-type creatine kinase peptide variants by two-dimensional NMR revealed stabilization via a lysine-phosphate salt bridge, which was disrupted by acetyl-Lys resulting in backbone flexibility and increased phosphatase accessibility."
https://openalex.org/W1990806007,"Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common acute otitis media pathogen, with an incidence that is increased by previous antibiotic treatment. NTHi is also an emerging causative agent of other chronic infections in humans, some linked to morbidity, and all of which impose substantial treatment costs. In this study we explore the possibility that antibiotic exposure may stimulate biofilm formation by NTHi bacteria. We discovered that sub-inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotic (i.e., amounts that partially inhibit bacterial growth) stimulated the biofilm-forming ability of NTHi strains, an effect that was strain and antibiotic dependent. When exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics NTHi strains produced tightly packed biofilms with decreased numbers of culturable bacteria but increased biomass. The ratio of protein per unit weight of biofilm decreased as a result of antibiotic exposure. Antibiotic-stimulated biofilms had altered ultrastructure, and genes involved in glycogen production and transporter function were up regulated in response to antibiotic exposure. Down-regulated genes were linked to multiple metabolic processes but not those involved in stress response. Antibiotic-stimulated biofilm bacteria were more resistant to a lethal dose (10 µg/mL) of cefuroxime. Our results suggest that beta-lactam antibiotic exposure may act as a signaling molecule that promotes transformation into the biofilm phenotype. Loss of viable bacteria, increase in biofilm biomass and decreased protein production coupled with a concomitant up-regulation of genes involved with glycogen production might result in a biofilm of sessile, metabolically inactive bacteria sustained by stored glycogen. These biofilms may protect surviving bacteria from subsequent antibiotic challenges, and act as a reservoir of viable bacteria once antibiotic exposure has ended."
https://openalex.org/W2031690598,"The objective of this study was to assess changes in corticospinal excitability and spinal output following noninvasive transpinal and transcortical stimulation in humans. The size of the motor evoked potentials (MEPs), induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and recorded from the right plantar flexor and extensor muscles, was assessed following transcutaneous electric stimulation of the spine (tsESS) over the thoracolumbar region at conditioning-test (C-T) intervals that ranged from negative 50 to positive 50 ms. The size of the transpinal evoked potentials (TEPs), induced by tsESS and recorded from the right and left plantar flexor and extensor muscles, was assessed following TMS over the left primary motor cortex at 0.7 and at 1.1× MEP resting threshold at C-T intervals that ranged from negative 50 to positive 50 ms. The recruitment curves of MEPs and TEPs had a similar shape, and statistically significant differences between the sigmoid function parameters of MEPs and TEPs were not found. Anodal tsESS resulted in early MEP depression followed by long-latency MEP facilitation of both ankle plantar flexors and extensors. TEPs of ankle plantar flexors and extensors were increased regardless TMS intensity level. Subthreshold and suprathreshold TMS induced short-latency TEP facilitation that was larger in the TEPs ipsilateral to TMS. Noninvasive transpinal stimulation affected ipsilateral and contralateral actions of corticospinal neurons, while corticocortical and corticospinal descending volleys increased TEPs in both limbs. Transpinal and transcortical stimulation is a noninvasive neuromodulation method that alters corticospinal excitability and increases motor output of multiple spinal segments in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2032571358,"Remodeling of collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is crucial to tissue homeostasis and repair. MMP-13 is a collagenase with a substrate preference for collagen II over collagens I and III. It recognizes a specific, well-known site in the tropocollagen molecule where its binding locally perturbs the triple helix, allowing the catalytic domain of the active enzyme to cleave the collagen α chains sequentially, at Gly775–Leu776 in collagen II. However, the specific residues upon which collagen recognition depends within and surrounding this locus have not been systematically mapped. Using our triple-helical peptide Collagen Toolkit libraries in solid-phase binding assays, we found that MMP-13 shows little affinity for Collagen Toolkit III, but binds selectively to two triple-helical peptides of Toolkit II. We have identified the residues required for the adhesion of both proMMP-13 and MMP-13 to one of these, Toolkit peptide II-44, which contains the canonical collagenase cleavage site. MMP-13 was unable to bind to a linear peptide of the same sequence as II-44. We also discovered a second binding site near the N terminus of collagen II (starting at helix residue 127) in Toolkit peptide II-8. The pattern of binding of the free hemopexin domain of MMP-13 was similar to that of the full-length enzyme, but the free catalytic subunit bound none of our peptides. The susceptibility of Toolkit peptides to proteolysis in solution was independent of the very specific recognition of immobilized peptides by MMP-13; the enzyme proved able to cleave a range of dissolved collagen peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2065127110,"Cigarette smoke exposure is linked to the development of a variety of chronic lung and systemic diseases in susceptible individuals. Metabolomics approaches may aid in defining disease phenotypes, may help predict responses to treatment, and could identify biomarkers of risk for developing disease. Using a mouse model of chronic cigarette smoke exposure sufficient to cause mild emphysema, we investigated whether cigarette smoke induces distinct metabolic profiles and determined their persistence following smoking cessation. Metabolites were extracted from plasma and fractionated based on chemical class using liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction prior to performing liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Metabolites were evaluated for statistically significant differences among group means (p-value≤0.05) and fold change ≥1.5). Cigarette smoke exposure was associated with significant differences in amino acid, purine, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolite levels compared to air exposed animals. Whereas 60% of the metabolite changes were reversible, 40% of metabolites remained persistently altered even following 2 months of smoking cessation, including nicotine metabolites. Validation of metabolite species and translation of these findings to human plasma metabolite signatures induced by cigarette smoking may lead to the discovery of biomarkers or pathogenic pathways of smoking-induced disease."
https://openalex.org/W2108548260,"Colors and odors are associated; for instance, people typically match the smell of strawberries to the color pink or red. These associations are forms of crossmodal correspondences. Recently, there has been discussion about the extent to which these correspondences arise for structural reasons (i.e., an inherent mapping between color and odor), statistical reasons (i.e., covariance in experience), and/or semantically-mediated reasons (i.e., stemming from language). The present study probed this question by testing color-odor correspondences in 6 different cultural groups (Dutch, Netherlands-residing-Chinese, German, Malay, Malaysian-Chinese, and US residents), using the same set of 14 odors and asking participants to make congruent and incongruent color choices for each odor. We found consistent patterns in color choices for each odor within each culture, showing that participants were making non-random color-odor matches. We used representational dissimilarity analysis to probe for variations in the patterns of color-odor associations across cultures; we found that US and German participants had the most similar patterns of associations, followed by German and Malay participants. The largest group differences were between Malay and Netherlands-resident Chinese participants and between Dutch and Malaysian-Chinese participants. We conclude that culture plays a role in color-odor crossmodal associations, which likely arise, at least in part, through experience."
https://openalex.org/W2044805997,"Growing evidence shows the potential of nutritional interventions to treat obesity but most investigations have utilized non-digestible carbohydrates only. Peach and plum contain high amounts of polyphenols, compounds with demonstrated anti-obesity effects. The underlying process of successfully treating obesity using polyphenols may involve an alteration of the intestinal microbiota. However, this phenomenon is not well understood.Obese Zucker rats were assigned to three groups (peach, plum, and control, n = 10 each), wild-type group was named lean (n = 10). Carbohydrates in the fruit juices were eliminated using enzymatic hydrolysis. Fecal samples were obtained after 11 weeks of fruit or control juice administration. Real-time PCR and 454-pyrosequencing were used to evaluate changes in fecal microbiota. Over 1,500 different Operational Taxonomic Units at 97% similarity were detected in all rats. Several bacterial groups (e.g. Lactobacillus and members of Ruminococcacea) were found to be more abundant in the peach but especially in the plum group (plum juice contained 3 times more total polyphenolics compared to peach juice). Principal coordinate analysis based on Unifrac-based unweighted distance matrices revealed a distinct separation between the microbiota of control and treatment groups. These changes in fecal microbiota occurred simultaneously with differences in fecal short-chain acids concentrations between the control and treatment groups as well as a significant decrease in body weight in the plum group.This study suggests that consumption of carbohydrate-free peach and plum juice has the potential to modify fecal microbial ecology in an obese animal model. The separate contribution of polyphenols and non-polyphenols compounds (vitamins and minerals) to the observed changes is unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2058343866,"Calcific aortic stenosis is a common disease, and some of its early causes are the activation and differentiation of resident fibroblasts to myofibroblasts in response to transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1). The aim of this study was to understand how TGF-β1 and its downstream effector, OB-cadherin [cadherin 11 (CDH11)], regulate porcine myofibroblast phenotypes. Based on whole-genome microarrays, 95 and 107 genes are up- and down-regulated at both the early (8 h) and the late (24 h) time points of TGF-β1 treatment. Gene functions related to cell adhesion, skeletal system development, and extracellular matrix are up-regulated by TGF-β1, whereas oxidation-reduction and steroid metabolic process are down-regulated. Notably, one of the cell adhesion molecules, CDH11, is up-regulated by ~2-fold through both the Smad2/3 and the ERK pathways elicited by TGF-β1. CDH11 mediates cell-cell contacts in both valvular fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Knockdown of CDH11 by small interfering RNA increases the myofibroblast phenotype, including an ~ 2-fold increase in α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and stress fiber formation. In contrast, increased binding of CDH11 through antibody treatment inhibits α-SMA expression. This study presents gene functional changes in response to TGF-β1 at the systems level and supports an inhibitory role of CDH11 in myofibroblast differentiation.—Wang, H., Leinwand, L.

https://openalex.org/W2012916169,"Alcohol use is common in adolescence, with a large portion of intake occurring during episodes of binging. This pattern of alcohol consumption coincides with a critical period for neurocognitive development and may impact decision-making and reward processing. Prior studies have demonstrated alterations in adult decision-making following adolescent usage, but it remains to be seen if these alterations exist in adolescence, or are latent until adulthood. Here, using a translational model of voluntary binge alcohol consumption in adolescents, we assess the impact of alcohol intake on risk preference and behavioral flexibility during adolescence. During adolescence (postnatal day 30–50), rats were given 1-hour access to either a 10% alcohol gelatin mixture (EtOH) or a calorie equivalent gelatin (Control) at the onset of the dark cycle. EtOH consuming rats were classified as either High or Low consumers based on intake levels. Adolescent rats underwent behavioral testing once a day, with one group performing a risk preference task, and a second group performing a reversal-learning task during the 20-day period of gelatin access. EtOH-High rats showed increases in risk preference compared to Control rats, but not EtOH-Low animals. However, adolescent rats did a poor job of matching their behavior to optimize outcomes, suggesting that adolescents may adopt a response bias. In addition, adolescent ethanol exposure did not affect the animals' ability to flexibly adapt behavior to changing reward contingencies during reversal learning. These data support the view that adolescent alcohol consumption can have short-term detrimental effects on risk-taking when examined during adolescence, which does not seem to be attributable to an inability to flexibly encode reward contingencies on behavioral responses."
https://openalex.org/W2046971806,"Endothelial injury, which may present clinically as hypertension, proteinuria and increased von Willebrand Factor (vWF) level, is a common manifestation in IgA nephropathy (IgAN). However, causal factors for endothelial injury in IgAN are not completely understood. An imbalance of vascular endothelial growth factor/Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (VEGF/sFlt-1) has been observed in many diseases with endothelial dysfunction, including pre-eclampsia and diabetic retinopathy, but whether it contributes to endothelial injury in IgAN requires further exploration.Initially, 96 IgAN patients and 22 healthy volunteers were enrolled as a discovery cohort. VEGF/sFlt-1, sFlt-1 and VEGF levels were compared between patients with IgAN and healthy volunteers to explore the underlying factors that contribute to endothelial injury in IgAN. The identified contributor (sFlt-1) was further confirmed in a replication cohort, which included 109 IgAN patients and 30 healthy volunteers. Correlations of sFlt-1 with hypertension, proteinuria, Oxford-E score and plasma vWF were further evaluated in the combined 205 patients with IgAN.VEGF/sFlt-1 levels were significantly lower in IgAN patients than healthy volunteers (0.33±0.27 vs. 0.43±0.22, p = 0.02) in the discovery cohort. Within the ratio, plasma sFlt-1 levels were significantly elevated (101.18±25.19 vs. 79.73±18.85 pg/ml, p<0.001), but plasma VEGF levels showed no significant differences. Elevated sFlt-1 levels in the replication cohort were confirmed in IgAN patients (93.40±39.78 vs. 71.92±15.78 pg/ml, p<0.001). Plasma sFlt-1 levels in IgAN patients correlated with proteinuria (severe (>3.5 g/d) vs. moderate (1-3.5 g/d) vs. mild (<1 g/d) proteinuria: 115.95±39.09 vs. 99.89±28.55 vs. 83.24±33.92 pg/ml; severe vs. mild: p<0.001, moderate vs. mild p = 0.001, severe vs. moderate: p = 0.014), hypertension (with vs. without hypertension: 107.87±31.94 vs. 87.32±32.76 pg/ml, p = 0.015) and vWF levels (r = 0.161, p = 0.021).The present study found elevated sFlt-1 in IgAN patients and further identified its correlation with proteinuria, hypertension and vWF levels. These results suggested that elevated sFlt-1 contributes to endothelial injury in IgAN."
https://openalex.org/W2056654338,"Background p38 MAPK activity plays an important role in several steps of the osteoblast lineage progression through activation of osteoblast-specific transcription factors and it is also essential for the acquisition of the osteoblast phenotype in early development. Although reports indicate p38 signalling plays a role in early skeletal development, its specific contributions to adult bone remodelling are still to be clarified. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated osteoblast-specific deletion of p38α to determine its significance in early skeletogenesis, as well as for bone homeostasis in adult skeleton. Early p38α deletion resulted in defective intramembranous and endochondral ossification in both calvaria and long bones. Mutant mice showed reduction of trabecular bone volume in distal femurs, associated with low trabecular thickness. In addition, knockout mice also displayed decreased femoral cortical bone volume and thickness. Deletion of p38α did not affect osteoclast function. Yet it impaired osteoblastogenesis and osteoblast maturation and activity through decreased expression of osteoblast-specific transcription factors and their targets. Furthermore, the inducible Cre system allowed us to control the onset of p38α disruption after birth by removal of doxycycline. Deletion of p38α at three or eight weeks postnatally led to significantly lower trabecular and cortical bone volume after 6 or 12 months. Conclusions Our data demonstrates that, in addition to early skeletogenesis, p38α is essential for osteoblasts to maintain their function in mineralized adult bone, as bone anabolism should be sustained throughout life. Moreover, our data also emphasizes that clinical development of p38 inhibitors should take into account their potential bone effects."
https://openalex.org/W1995034911,"Atherosclerotic disease, and the subsequent complications of thrombosis and plaque rupture, has been associated with local shear stress. In the diseased carotid artery, local variations in shear stress are induced by various geometrical features of the stenotic plaque. Greater stenosis severity, plaque eccentricity (symmetry) and plaque ulceration have been associated with increased risk of cerebrovascular events based on clinical trial studies. Using particle image velocimetry, the levels and patterns of shear stress (derived from both laminar and turbulent phases) were studied for a family of eight matched-geometry models incorporating independently varied plaque features – i.e. stenosis severity up to 70%, one of two forms of plaque eccentricity, and the presence of plaque ulceration). The level of laminar (ensemble-averaged) shear stress increased with increasing stenosis severity resulting in 2–16 Pa for free shear stress (FSS) and approximately double (4–36 Pa) for wall shear stress (WSS). Independent of stenosis severity, marked differences were found in the distribution and extent of shear stress between the concentric and eccentric plaque formations. The maximum WSS, found at the apex of the stenosis, decayed significantly steeper along the outer wall of an eccentric model compared to the concentric counterpart, with a 70% eccentric stenosis having 249% steeper decay coinciding with the large outer-wall recirculation zone. The presence of ulceration (in a 50% eccentric plaque) resulted in both elevated FSS and WSS levels that were sustained longer (∼20 ms) through the systolic phase compared to the non-ulcerated counterpart model, among other notable differences. Reynolds (turbulent) shear stress, elevated around the point of distal jet detachment, became prominent during the systolic deceleration phase and was widely distributed over the large recirculation zone in the eccentric stenoses."
https://openalex.org/W2054576333,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a key regulator of vascular tone. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is responsible for NO generation under normoxic conditions. Under hypoxia however, eNOS is inactive and red blood cells (RBC) provide an alternative NO generation pathway from nitrite to regulate hypoxic vasodilation. While nitrite reductase activity of hemoglobin is well acknowledged, little is known about generation of NO by intact RBC with physiological hemoglobin concentrations. We aimed to develop and apply a new approach to provide insights in the ability of RBC to convert nitrite into NO under hypoxic conditions. We established a novel experimental setup to evaluate nitrite uptake and the release of NO from RBC into the gas-phase under different conditions. NO measurements were similar to well-established clinical measurements of exhaled NO. Nitrite uptake was rapid, and after an initial lag phase NO release from RBC was constant in time under hypoxic conditions. The presence of oxygen greatly reduced NO release, whereas inhibition of eNOS and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) did not affect NO release. A decreased pH increased NO release under hypoxic conditions. Hypothermia lowered NO release, while hyperthermia increased NO release. Whereas fetal hemoglobin did not alter NO release compared to adult hemoglobin, sickle RBC showed an increased ability to release NO. Under all conditions nitrite uptake by RBC was similar. This study shows that nitrite uptake into RBC is rapid and release of NO into the gas-phase continues for prolonged periods of time under hypoxic conditions. Changes in the RBC environment such as pH, temperature or hemoglobin type, affect NO release."
https://openalex.org/W2007636374,"There have been 3 outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Uganda in the last 2 years. VHF often starts with non-specific symptoms prior to the onset of haemorrhagic signs. HIV clinics in VHF outbreak countries such as Uganda see large numbers of patients with HIV 1/2 infection presenting with non-specific symptoms every day. Whilst there are good screening tools for general health care facilities expecting VHF suspects, we were unable to find tools for use in HIV or other non-acute clinics.We designed tools to help with communication to staff, infection control and screening of HIV patients with non-specific symptoms in a large HIV clinic during the outbreaks in Uganda. We describe our experiences in using these tools in 2 Ebola Virus Disease outbreaks in Uganda.During the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreaks, enhanced infection control and communication procedures were implemented within 24 hours of the WHO/Ministry of Health announcement of the outbreaks. During course of these outbreaks the clinic saw 12,544 patients with HIV 1/2 infection, of whom 3,713 attended without an appointment, suggesting new symptoms. Of these 4 were considered at risk of EVD and seen with full infection procedures; 3 were sent home after further investigation. One patient was referred to the National Referral Hospital VHF unit, but discharged on the same day. One additional VHF suspect was identified outside of a VHF outbreak; he was transferred to the National Referral Hospital and placed in isolation within 2 hours of arriving at the HIV clinic.Use of simple screening tools can be helpful in managing large numbers of symptomatic patients attending for routine and non-routine medical care (including HIV care) within a country experiencing a VHF outbreak, and can raise medical staff awareness of VHF outside of the epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2031184481,"In the kidney, epithelial cells of the thick ascending limb (TAL) reabsorb NaCl via the apical Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter NKCC2. Steady-state surface NKCC2 levels in the apical membrane are maintained by a balance between exocytic delivery, endocytosis, and recycling. cAMP is the second messenger of hormones that enhance NaCl absorption. cAMP stimulates NKCC2 exocytic delivery via protein kinase A (PKA), increasing steady-state surface NKCC2. However, the molecular mechanism involved has not been studied. We found that several members of the SNARE family of membrane fusion proteins are expressed in TALs. Here we report that NKCC2 co-immunoprecipitates with VAMP2 in rat TALs, and they co-localize in discrete domains at the apical surface. cAMP stimulation enhanced VAMP2 exocytic delivery to the plasma membrane of renal cells, and stimulation of PKA enhanced VAMP2-NKCC2 co-immunoprecipitation in TALs. In vivo silencing of VAMP2 but not VAMP3 in TALs blunted cAMP-stimulated steady-state surface NKCC2 expression and completely blocked cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytic delivery. VAMP2 was not involved in constitutive NKCC2 delivery. We concluded that VAMP2 but not VAMP3 selectively mediates cAMP-stimulated NKCC2 exocytic delivery and surface expression in TALs. We also demonstrated that cAMP stimulation enhances VAMP2 exocytosis and promotes VAMP2 interaction with NKCC2."
https://openalex.org/W2038091866,"Wingless-related proteins (WNTs) regulate extension of the central axis of the vertebrate embryo (convergent extension) as well as morphogenesis of organs such as limbs and kidneys. Here, we asked whether WNT signaling directs facial morphogenesis using a targeted approach in chicken embryos. WNT11 is thought to mainly act via β-catenin-independent pathways, and little is known about its role in craniofacial development. RCAS::WNT11 retrovirus was injected into the maxillary prominence, and the majority of embryos developed notches in the upper beak or the equivalent of cleft lip. Three-dimensional morphometric analysis revealed that WNT11 prevented lengthening of the maxillary prominence, which was due in part to decreased proliferation. We next determined, using a series of luciferase reporters, that WNT11 strongly induced JNK/planar cell polarity signaling while repressing the β-catenin-mediated pathway. The activation of the JNK-ATF2 reporter was mediated by the DEP domain of Dishevelled. The impacts of altered signaling on the mesenchyme were assessed by implanted Wnt11- or Wnt3a-expressing cells (activates β-catenin pathway) into the maxillary prominence or by knocking down endogenous WNT11 with RNAi. Host cells were attracted to Wnt11 donor cells. In contrast, cells exposed to Wnt3a or the control cells did not migrate. Cells in which endogenous WNT11 was knocked down were more oriented and shorter than those exposed to exogenous WNT11. The data suggest that JNK/planar cell polarity WNT signaling operates in the face to regulate several morphogenetic events leading to lip fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2160366403,"The way environmental variation shapes neutral and adaptive genetic variation in natural populations is a key issue in evolutionary biology. Genome scans allow the identification of the genetic basis of local adaptation without previous knowledge of genetic variation or traits under selection. Candidate loci for divergent adaptation are expected to show higher FST than neutral loci influenced solely by random genetic drift, migration and mutation. The comparison of spatial patterns of neutral markers and loci under selection may help disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection among populations living in contrasting environments. Using the gastropod Radix balthica as a system, we analyzed 376 AFLP markers and 25 mtDNA COI haplotypes for candidate loci and associations with local adaptation among contrasting thermal environments in Lake Mývatn, a volcanic lake in northern Iceland. We found that 2% of the analysed AFLP markers were under directional selection and 12% of the mitochondrial haplotypes correlated with differing thermal habitats. The genetic networks were concordant for AFLP markers and mitochondrial haplotypes, depicting distinct topologies at neutral and candidate loci. Neutral topologies were characterized by intense gene flow revealed by dense nets with edges connecting contrasting thermal habitats, whereas the connections at candidate loci were mostly restricted to populations within each thermal habitat and the number of edges decreased with temperature. Our results suggest microgeographic adaptation within Lake Mývatn and highlight the utility of genome scans in detecting adaptive divergence."
https://openalex.org/W1964121620,"p300 is a well-known histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and coactivator that plays vital roles in many physiological processes. Despite extensive research on the involvement of p300 in the regulation of transcription in numerous cell lines, the roles of this protein in regulating pluripotency genes and odontogenic differentiation in human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) are poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigated the expression of OCT4, NANOG and SOX2 and the proliferation and odontogenic differentiation capacity of HDPCs following p300 overexpression. We found that p300 overexpression did not overtly affect the ability of HDPCs to proliferate. The overexpression of p300 upregulated the promoter activity and the mRNA and protein expression of NANOG and SOX2. The HAT activity of p300 appeared to partially mediate the regulation of these factors; indeed, when a mutant form of p300 lacking the HAT domain was overexpressed, the promoter activity and expression of NANOG and SOX2 decreased relative to p300 overexpression but was greater than in the control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the odontogenic marker genes dentine matrix protein-1 (DMP-1), dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP), dentin sialoprotein (DSP), osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin (OCN) were significantly decreased in HDPCs overexpressing p300 cultured under normal culture conditions and increased in HDPCs inducted to undergo odontogenic differentiation. This finding was further confirmed by measuring levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and assessing the formation of mineralized nodules. The HAT activity of p300 had no significant effect on odontogenic differentiation. p300 was recruited to the promoter regions of OCN and DSPP and might be acting as a coactivator to increase the acetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 of OCN and DSPP. Collectively, our results show that p300 plays an important role in regulating the expression of key pluripotency genes in HDPCs and modifying odontogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1993939004,"Photoautotrophic organisms efficiently regulate absorption of light energy to sustain photochemistry while promoting photoprotection. Photoprotection is achieved in part by triggering a series of dissipative processes termed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which depend on the re-organization of photosystem (PS) II supercomplexes in thylakoid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we characterized the structural attributes of grana thylakoids from Arabidopsis thaliana to correlate differences in PSII organization with the role of SOQ1, a recently discovered thylakoid protein that prevents formation of a slowly reversible NPQ state. We developed a statistical image analysis suite to discriminate disordered from crystalline particles and classify crystalline arrays according to their unit cell properties. Through detailed analysis of the local organization of PSII supercomplexes in ordered and disordered phases, we found evidence that interactions among light-harvesting antenna complexes are weakened in the absence of SOQ1, inducing protein rearrangements that favor larger separations between PSII complexes in the majority (disordered) phase and reshaping the PSII crystallization landscape. The features we observe are distinct from known protein rearrangements associated with NPQ, providing further support for a role of SOQ1 in a novel NPQ pathway. The particle clustering and unit cell methodology developed here is generalizable to multiple types of microscopy and will enable unbiased analysis and comparison of large data sets."
https://openalex.org/W2005717024,"Various hippocampal and neocortical synapses of mammalian brain show both short-term plasticity and long-term plasticity, which are considered to underlie learning and memory by the brain. According to Hebb's postulate, synaptic plasticity encodes memory traces of past experiences into cell assemblies in cortical circuits. However, it remains unclear how the various forms of long-term and short-term synaptic plasticity cooperatively create and reorganize such cell assemblies. Here, we investigate the mechanism in which the three forms of synaptic plasticity known in cortical circuits, i.e., spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), short-term depression (STD) and homeostatic plasticity, cooperatively generate, retain and reorganize cell assemblies in a recurrent neuronal network model. We show that multiple cell assemblies generated by external stimuli can survive noisy spontaneous network activity for an adequate range of the strength of STD. Furthermore, our model predicts that a symmetric temporal window of STDP, such as observed in dopaminergic modulations on hippocampal neurons, is crucial for the retention and integration of multiple cell assemblies. These results may have implications for the understanding of cortical memory processes."
https://openalex.org/W2058258781,"Increase of the density of dendritic spines and enhancement of synaptic transmission through ionotropic glutamate receptors are important events, leading to synaptic plasticity and eventually hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory formation. Here we have undertaken an innovative approach to upregulate hippocampal plasticity. RNS60 is a 0.9% saline solution containing charge-stabilized nanobubbles that are generated by subjecting normal saline to Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille (TCP) flow under elevated oxygen pressure. RNS60, but not NS (normal saline), PNS60 (saline containing a comparable level of oxygen without the TCP modification), or RNS10.3 (TCP-modified normal saline without excess oxygen), stimulated morphological plasticity and synaptic transmission via NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive calcium influx in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons. Using mRNA-based targeted gene array, real-time PCR, immunoblot, and immunofluorescence analyses, we further demonstrate that RNS60 stimulated the expression of many plasticity-associated genes in cultured hippocampal neurons. Activation of type IA, but not type IB, phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase by RNS60 together with abrogation of RNS60-mediated upregulation of plasticity-related proteins (NR2A and GluR1) and increase in spine density, neuronal size, and calcium influx by LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, suggest that RNS60 upregulates hippocampal plasticity via activation of PI-3 kinase. Finally, in the 5XFAD transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), RNS60 treatment upregulated expression of plasticity-related proteins PSD95 and NR2A and increased AMPA- and NMDA-dependent hippocampal calcium influx. These results describe a novel property of RNS60 in stimulating hippocampal plasticity, which may help AD and other dementias."

This RasGAP-derived peptide, by targeting the deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC1) tumor suppressor, also hampers cell migration and invasion by promoting cell adherence and by inhibiting cell movement. Here, we systematically investigated the role of each amino acid within the RasGAP317-326 sequence for the anticancer activities of TAT-RasGAP317-326. We report here that the first three amino acids of this sequence, tryptophan, methionine, and tryptophan (WMW), are necessary and sufficient to sensitize cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and to reduce cell migration. The WMW motif was found to be critical for the binding of fragment N2 to DLC1. These results define the interaction mode between the active anticancer sequence of RasGAP and DLC1. This knowledge will facilitate the design of small molecules bearing the tumor-sensitizing and antimetastatic activities of TAT-RasGAP317-326."
https://openalex.org/W2092401854,"Diversity and community patterns of macro- and megafauna were compared on the Canadian Beaufort shelf and slope. Faunal sampling collected 247 taxa from 48 stations with box core and trawl gear over the summers of 2009–2011 between 50 and 1,000 m in depth. Of the 80 macrofaunal and 167 megafaunal taxa, 23% were uniques, present at only one station. Rare taxa were found to increase proportional to total taxa richness and differ between the shelf ( 100 m) where they tended to be sparse and the slope where they were relatively abundant. The macrofauna principally comprised polychaetes with nephtyid polychaetes dominant on the shelf and maldanid polychaetes (up to 92% in relative abundance/station) dominant on the slope. The megafauna principally comprised echinoderms with Ophiocten sp. (up to 90% in relative abundance/station) dominant on the shelf and Ophiopleura sp. dominant on the slope. Macro- and megafauna had divergent patterns of abundance, taxa richness ( diversity) and diversity. A greater degree of macrofaunal than megafaunal variation in abundance, richness and diversity was explained by confounding factors: location (east-west), sampling year and the timing of sampling with respect to sea-ice conditions. Change in megafaunal abundance, richness and diversity was greatest across the depth gradient, with total abundance and richness elevated on the shelf compared to the slope. We conclude that megafaunal slope taxa were differentiated from shelf taxa, as faunal replacement not nestedness appears to be the main driver of megafaunal diversity across the depth gradient."

The cDNA encoding VIMP(48–187) was inserted into pGEX-4T-3. The cDNAs encoding Reep1/Reep5 and ATL1 (gifts from Dr. Craig Blackstone, NINDS, Bethesda, MD) were inserted into pFLAG-CMV-5a and pFLAG-CMV-6c, respectively, so as to express Reep1 and Reep5 each with a C-terminal FLAG tag and ATL1 with an N-terminal FLAG tag. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M.

For immunoprecipitation of endogenous VIMP, 293T cells were homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the membrane pellet was solubilized in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. For immunoprecipitation of expressed proteins, 293T cells expressing FLAG-tagged proteins were lysed in homogenization buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at room temperature and observed with an Olympus FluoView 300 or 1000 laser scanning microscope as described (28.Tagaya M.

Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously (30.Gilady S.Y. Bui M. Lynes E.M. Benson M.D. Watts R. Vance J.E. Simmen T.

MT sedimentation assay was conducted as described previously (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M.

After centrifugation, equal protein amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against GST and α-tubulin. The RNA duplexes used for targeting VIMP were VIMP(210) (5′-ggaaccugauguuguuguuaa-3′), VIMP(247) (5′-gcagcugcucgacugaaaau-3′), CLIMP-63(748) (5′-gacaacaucgccaucuuca-3′), Syn18(390) (5-caggaccgcuguuuuggauuu-3), and Syn5(390) (5′-ggaaauugaagagcuaaca-3′). The number in parentheses after each protein name indicates the position of the first nucleotide of siRNA relative to the start codon. All siRNAs were purchased from Japan Bioservice. Transfection was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmid encoding ts045 VSVG-GFP was kindly supplied by Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Assay was conducted as described previously (31.Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. ER-to-Golgi transport visualized in living cells.Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). VIMP is a 189-amino acid protein with one N-terminal transmembrane domain (amino acids 26–49) and luminal N-terminal and cytoplasmic C-terminal domains (Fig. 1A). A previous study showed that overexpression of VIMP altered ER morphology to filamentous structures (24.Ye Y. Shibata Y. Yun C. Ron D. Rapoport T.A. A membrane protein complex mediates retro-translocation from the ER lumen into the cytosol.Nature. 2004; 429: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). To examine whether MTs are involved in formation of the filamentous structure, we first overexpressed FLAG-VIMP(1–187) and compared the distribution of FLAG-VIMP-positive filaments with that of MTs. As shown in Fig. 1B, FLAG-VIMP caused the rearrangement of the ER, as seen by calnexin staining (upper panels), and MTs, as seen by α-tubulin staining (lower panels). This ER-MT-bundling pattern is almost the same as that observed in cells overexpressing CLIMP-63 (15.Klopfenstein D.R. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P. A novel direct interaction of endoplasmic reticulum with microtubules.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6168-6177Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and Syn5L (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A similar ER-MT-bundling pattern was observed in cells expressing FLAG-tagged full-length VIMP (amino acids 1–189) (data not shown). Given that VIMP has an ER-MT-bundling activity, we next examined whether it interacts with CLIMP-63. As shown in Fig. 2A, CLIMP-63 coprecipitated with an anti-VIMP antibody (lane 2), whereas no coprecipitation was observed with a control IgG (lane 3). Of note is that α-tubulin did not coprecipitate with VIMP, excluding the possibility that the link between VIMP and CLIMP-63 is mediated through tubulins. To assess the importance of the link between VIMP and CLIMP-63, we knocked down CLIMP-63 by siRNA (Fig. 2B) and examined the formation of ER-MT bundling induced by VIMP overexpression. As shown in Fig. 2C, no clear bundling was detected in the absence of CLIMP-63 (middle panels), whereas bundling occurred in the absence of Syn5 (lower panels), which has been shown to bind to CLIMP-63 (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We then examined the interaction of VIMP with polymerized MTs. To this end, a VIMP construct (amino acids 48–187) lacking the transmembrane domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified. The purified protein was mixed with Taxol-stabilized MTs and then subjected to sedimentation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2D, almost all of GST-VIMP(48–187) (left, lane 6), but not GST (lane 3), coprecipitated with polymerized MTs. This coprecipitation did not occur in the absence of MTs (Fig. 2D, right, lane 6), suggesting the specific binding between VIMP and polymerized MTs. To confirm the interaction between VIMP and CLIMP-63, we expressed VIMP as a FLAG-tagged protein in 293T cells and performed immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 3A (lane 12), CLIMP-63 (second panel), in addition to VCP (upper panel) and the long form of Syn5 (Syn5L) (third panel), coprecipitated with FLAG-VIMP(1–187). A similar precipitation pattern was observed for FLAG-tagged full-length VIMP (data not shown), suggesting that selenocysteine is not involved in the interaction with these proteins. Because Syn5L coprecipitated with FLAG-VIMP, we examined the endogenous interaction between Syn5 and VIMP. We found little coprecipitation of Syn5 with an anti-VIMP antibody (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction of VIMP with Syn5L is weak compared with that with CLIMP-63. To define the regions of VIMP responsible for the interactions with CLIMP-63 and Syn5, we produced a series of C-terminally truncated mutants. VIMP(1–175) showed a markedly decreased ability to bind to CLIMP-63, but retained Syn5L-binding ability (Fig. 3A, lane 11). VIMP(1–166) (lane 10), but not VIMP(1–146) (lane 9), was found to have Syn5L-binding activity. Essentially no binding to Syn5L or CLIMP-63 was observed for VIMP(1–73) (Fig. 3A, lane 8). The bundle-forming activity of VIMP appeared to be correlated with its CLIMP-63- and Syn5L-binding abilities. VIMP(1–175) and VIMP(1–166), both of which bound Syn5L but little or no CLIMP-63 (Fig. 3A, lanes 10 and 11), exhibited a bundling-staining pattern, but with a substantial background of diffuse staining (Fig. 3B, second and third rows). Bundling was not obvious for VIMP(1–146) (Fig. 3B, fourth row), which bound little or no CLIMP-63 or Syn5L (Fig. 3A, lane 9), and an ER- and/or plasma membrane-staining pattern was observed for VIMP(1–73) (Fig. 3B, lower row). Intuitively, the data in Fig. 3B (second and third rows) appear to be contradictory to the finding that CLIMP-63 is essential for ER-MT bundling (Fig. 2C). The VIMP constructs with very low CLIMP-63-binding activities could induce ER-MT bundling. This can be reconciled with the idea that CLIMP-63 is a principal ER-MT anchor protein, whereas VIMP and Syn5L are secondary ones. In the presence of endogenous CLIMP-63, the ER is fully attached to MTs; therefore, the interaction of overexpressed VIMP with endogenous Syn5L might be enough to form ER-MT bundles (Fig. 3B, second and third rows). In contrast, in the absence of CLIMP-63, the association of overexpressed VIMP with endogenous Syn5L might be insufficient for the formation of ER-MT bundles (Fig. 2C). To investigate whether VIMP is involved in the organization of the ER, we knocked down VIMP expression and examined the morphology of the ER. Both siRNA(210) and siRNA(247) effectively knocked down VIMP expression (Fig. 4A). Of note, no dispersal of a Golgi marker (GM130) was observed, suggesting that ER-to-Golgi transport is not impaired in VIMP-depleted cells. Consistent with this idea, the transport of VSVG-GFP from the ER to the plasma membrane through the Golgi apparatus was not significantly affected by VIMP depletion (Fig. 4B). In contrast, both siRNAs caused spreading of the ER membrane proteins Sec61β and CLIMP-63 to the cell periphery (Fig. 5A). These spreading patterns were similar to those in cells depleted of CLIMP-63 or Syn5 (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of VIMP in shaping the ER.FIGURE 5.Knockdown of VIMP causes ER spreading. HeLa cells (A) or those stably expressing mRFP-Sec61β (B) were transfected without (Mock) or with one of the siRNAs targeting VIMP (siRNA(210) or siRNA(247)). A, after 72 h, the HeLa cells were fixed and stained with an antibody against Sec61β (left) or CLIMP-63 (right). Sec61β or CLIMP-63 fluorescence along white lines from the nucleus to the cell periphery was analyzed using ImageJ software. The average values of fluorescence brightness in five cells are shown. Scale bar = 5 μm. B, alternatively, HeLa cells stably expressing mRFP-Sec61β were incubated with 5 μg/ml nocodazole, and live cell imaging was performed. Representative images at the indicated times are shown. Arrows indicate peripheral regions, where ER structures were rarely seen before nocodazole treatment. Scale bar = 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In cells depleted of Syn5, the distribution of spread ER membranes was not affected by the MT-depolymerizing reagent nocodazole (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To show that depletion of VIMP specifically affects ER structure, not cell shape, we treated mRFP-Sec61β-expressing cells with nocodazole and performed live cell imaging. As shown in Fig. 5B, nocodazole treatment of VIMP-depleted cells did not cause further mRFP-Sec61β spreading, whereas the centrally accumulated mRFP-Sec61β in mock-treated cells was redistributed to more peripheral regions upon nocodazole treatment. Our previous study showed that an ER membrane protein, Bap31, undergoes one-time cycling between the peripheral and perinuclear ER regions in an MT-dependent manner after treatment with BFA, an inhibitor of the ARF1 (ADP-ribosylation factor 1) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (32.Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Brefeldin A inhibits Golgi membrane-catalysed exchange of guanine nucleotide onto ARF protein.Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), followed by its washout (26.Wakana Y. Takai S. Nakajima K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Watson P. Stephens D.J. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Bap31 is an itinerant protein that moves between the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a juxtanuclear compartment related to ER-associated degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1825-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This may reflect the fact that the movement of Bap31 to the perinuclear region within the ER is ARF1-dependent (26.Wakana Y. Takai S. Nakajima K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Watson P. Stephens D.J. Hauri H.-P. Tagaya M. Bap31 is an itinerant protein that moves between the peripheral endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a juxtanuclear compartment related to ER-associated degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 1825-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To explore the link between VIMP and an MT-dependent process, we investigated the effect of VIMP depletion on the cycling of Bap31 within the ER. In mock-treated cells, BFA treatment/washout caused the movement of Bap31 to the perinuclear region at 120–240 min after BFA washout (Fig. 6, left), and the accumulated Bap31 returned to the cell periphery by 360 min in a considerable fraction of cells (lower row). In contrast, in VIMP-depleted cells, Bap31 exhibited large punctate peripheral staining at 120 min after BFA washout and did not accumulate at the perinuclear region (Fig. 6, right). At 360 min after BFA washout, Bap31 remained as punctuate structures in many cells (Fig. 6, lower row). These results suggest that the MT- and dynein-dependent movement of Bap31 to the perinuclear region is inhibited by VIMP depletion. Our previous study showed that Lys-82 of Syn5L is important for binding to CLIMP-63 and MTs (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7A, this residue is also responsible for the interaction with VIMP. Next, we examined whether VIMP interacts with proteins (such as the RTN, DP1/Yop1, and ATL families) that are responsible for shaping the smooth ER (20.Park S.H. Zhu P.P. Parker R.L. Blackstone C. Hereditary spastic paraplegia proteins REEP1, spastin, and atlastin-1 coordinate microtubule interactions with the tubular ER network.J. Clin.

A class of membrane proteins shaping the tubular endoplasmic reticulum.Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). These protein families and the MT-severing protein spastin interact with one another and coordinate MT interactions with the tubular ER network (20.Park S.H. Zhu P.P. Parker R.L. Blackstone C. Hereditary spastic paraplegia proteins REEP1, spastin, and atlastin-1 coordinate microtubule interactions with the tubular ER network.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 (B and C), Reep family members (Reep1 and Reep5 each represent two distinct Reep1 subfamilies (20.Park S.H. Zhu P.P. Parker R.L. Blackstone C. Hereditary spastic paraplegia proteins REEP1, spastin, and atlastin-1 coordinate microtubule interactions with the tubular ER network.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar)), ATL1, RTN3, RTN4a, RTN4b, and RTN4c were found not to bind to FLAG-VIMP. To determine the distribution of VIMP in the ER, we first performed subcellular fractionation using a 5–25% OptiPrep gradient. In our protocol, VIMP almost completely co-sedimented with CLIMP-63 with a peak in fractions 6 and 7, whereas the smooth ER marker RTN4 sedimented in fractions 4–9 without a clear peak (Fig. 8A). Next, we sought to examine the distribution of VIMP by immunoelectron microscopy. Because the immunoreactivity of our antibody to VIMP was lost upon fixation of cells with 4% PFA plus 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min or with 4% PFA for 2 h, we observed cells fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min. Because of mild fixation, the ultrastructure was slightly obscure, but the presence of VIMP on ER membranes was seen (Fig. 8B, arrows). As we could not clearly demonstrate the presence of VIMP on the rough ER, we examined whether VIMP behaves like rough ER membrane proteins upon Syn18 depletion. Our previous work showed that knockdown of Syn18, a SNARE localized in the ER (34.Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. Syntaxin 18, a SNAP receptor that functions in the endoplasmic reticulum, intermediate compartment, and cis-Golgi vesicle trafficking.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), causes segregation of rough and smooth ER membranes (29.Iinuma T. Aoki T. Arasaki K. Hirose H. Yamamoto A. Samata R. Hauri H.-P. Arimitsu N. Tagaya M. Tani K. Role of syntaxin 18 in the organization of endoplasmic reticulum subdomains.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. In Syn18-depleted cells, smooth ER membrane proteins such as RTN4 aggregate to form patch-like structures, whereas rough ER membrane proteins such as CLIMP-63 and Sec61β remain largely unchanged and are almost completely excluded from the patch-like structures (29.Iinuma T. Aoki T. Arasaki K. Hirose H. Yamamoto A. Samata R. Hauri H.-P. Arimitsu N. Tagaya M. Tani K. Role of syntaxin 18 in the organization of endoplasmic reticulum subdomains.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We knocked down Syn18 and stained cells with antibodies against VIMP and smooth or rough ER markers. In mock-treated cells, the distribution of all proteins examined was almost indistinguishable at the level of immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 9, A and B, left). As reported previously (29.Iinuma T. Aoki T. Arasaki K. Hirose H. Yamamoto A. Samata R. Hauri H.-P. Arimitsu N. Tagaya M. Tani K. Role of syntaxin 18 in the organization of endoplasmic reticulum subdomains.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1680-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in Syn18-depleted cells, RTN4 became aggregated, whereas CLIMP-63 and Sec61β largely retained their distributions except for the absence in RTN4-positive patches (Fig. 9A, right). Similarly, VIMP did not accumulate at the aggregates and largely retained normal morphology (Fig. 9B, right), consistent with the finding that VIMP specifically interacts with rough ER membrane proteins. MTs play an important role in the organization of the ER in mammalian cells. The static interaction between ER membranes and MTs is mediated by several ER-residing proteins (6.Vedrenne C. Hauri H.-P. Morphogenesis of the endoplasmic reticulum: beyond active membrane expansion.Traffic. 2006; 7: 639-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the ER-residing form of Syn5 (Syn5L) regulates ER structure by interacting with both CLIMP-63 and MTs (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that VIMP also contributes to the organization of the ER by interacting with both CLIMP-63 and MTs. It should be noted that VIMP binds to polymerized MTs (Fig. 2D), but not depolymerized tubulin (Fig. 2A), suggesting that VIMP directly interacts with CLIMP-63, not through tubulin. As in the case of Syn5L (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), ER-MT bundle formation induced by VIMP overexpression is dependent on the presence of CLIMP-63. Mutation analysis revealed a rough correlation between bundle formation and abilities to interact with CLIMP-63 and Syn5L. Of note, Lys-82 of Syn5L is responsible for the interaction with VIMP as well as with CLIMP-63 and MTs (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Perhaps multivalent and cooperative interactions of VIMP with MT-binding proteins and MTs are necessary for ER-MT bundle formation. It should be emphasized that CLIMP-63 serves as a critical hub for MT-binding ER proteins. Depletion of VIMP caused spreading of the ER membrane, a characteristic phenotype observed when the link between the ER and MTs is disrupted by nocodazole treatment (14.Miyazaki K. Wakana Y. Noda C. Arasaki K. Furuno A. Tagaya M. Contribution of the long form of syntaxin 5 to the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Sci. 2012; 125: 5658-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35.Lu L. Ladinsky M.S. Kirchhausen T. Cisternal organization of the endoplasmic reticulum during mitosis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3471-3480Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A difference in the effects of nocodazole treatment and VIMP depletion is that the Golgi apparatus is disassembled by MT depolymerization, whereas no Golgi disassembly is induced by VIMP depletion. In addition to a morphological change in the ER, VIMP depletion affected one round of MT-dependent Bap31 cycling after BFA washout. These results suggest that VIMP is involved in MT-dependent processes on the ER, but not in other pathways such as ER-to-Golgi transport and the maintenance of the steady-state distribution of GM130. Like CLIMP-63 (21.Hu J. Shibata Y. Zhu P.P. Voss C. Rismanchi N. Prinz W.A. Rapoport T.A. Blackstone C. A class of dynamin-like GTPases involved in the generation of the tubular ER network.Cell. 2009; 138: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), VIMP was found not to interact with smooth ER-shaping proteins. Moreover, our data show that VIMP did not accumulate in smooth ER patches in Syn18-depleted cells, although we could not clearly demonstrate that VIMP is localized in rough ER membranes by immunoelectron microscopy. Blackstone and co-workers (20.Park S.H. Zhu P.P. Parker R.L. Blackstone C.

Invest. 2010; 120: 1097-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility that Reep1 and CLIMP-63 play similar roles in mediating ER-MT interactions in different ER subdomains. Extending their idea, we have hypothesized that multivalent and cooperative interactions between ER membrane proteins, such as CLIMP-63 (15.Klopfenstein D.R. Kappeler F. Hauri H.-P.

The PsbP domain protein 1 (PPD1; At4g15510) is located in the thylakoid lumen of plant chloroplasts and is essential for photoautotrophy, functioning as a PS I assembly factor. In this work, RNAi was used to suppress PPD1 expression, yielding mutants displaying a range of phenotypes with respect to PS I accumulation and function. These PPD1 RNAi mutants showed a loss of assembled PS I that was correlated with loss of the PPD1 protein. In the most severely affected PPD1 RNAi lines, the accumulated PS I complexes exhibited defects in electron transfer from plastocyanin to the oxidized reaction center P700+. The defects in PS I assembly in the PPD1 RNAi mutants also had secondary effects with respect to the association of light-harvesting antenna complexes to PS I. Because of the imbalance in photosystem function in the PPD1 RNAi mutants, light-harvesting complex II associated with and acted as an antenna for the PS I complexes. These results provide new evidence for the role of PPD1 in PS I biogenesis, particularly as a factor essential for proper assembly of the lumenal portion of the complex. Photosystem I (PS I) is a multisubunit membrane protein complex that functions as a light-driven plastocyanin-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The PsbP domain protein 1 (PPD1; At4g15510) is located in the thylakoid lumen of plant chloroplasts and is essential for photoautotrophy, functioning as a PS I assembly factor.

https://openalex.org/W2044109531,"Posttranslational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) is being associated with a growing number of regulatory functions in diverse cellular processes. The biochemical investigation into the underlying molecular mechanisms, however, has been lagging behind due to the difficulty to generate sufficient amounts of recombinant SUMOylated proteins. Here, we present two newly designed two-component vector systems for the expression and purification of SUMO-modified target proteins in Escherichia coli. One system consists of a vector for SUMO conjugation, expressing human SUMO-activating (SAE1/SAE2) and conjugating (Ubc9) enzymes together with His6-tagged SUMO1, 2 or 3, that can be combined with commonly used expression constructs for any gene of interest. To facilitate SUMOylation of targets normally requiring a SUMO-E3 ligase for efficient modification, a second system is designed to express the target protein as a fusion with the human SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, thus compensating the absence of a potential SUMO ligase. We demonstrate the proficiency of these systems by SUMOylation of two DNA repair proteins, the thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and XRCC1, and describe purification schemes for SUMOylated proteins in native and active form. This SUMO toolbox facilitates “in-cell” and “in-extract” production and purification of recombinant SUMO-modified target proteins for functional and structural analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2080386375,"To develop public-health policies that extend the lifespan of affordable anti-malarial drugs as effective treatment options, it is necessary to understand the evolutionary processes leading to the origin and spread of mutations conferring drug resistance in malarial parasites. We built a population-genetic model for the emergence of resistance under combination drug therapy. Reproductive cycles of parasites are specified by their absolute fitness determined by clinical parameters, thus coupling the evolutionary-genetic with population-dynamic processes. Initial mutations confer only partial drug-resistance. Therefore, mutant parasites rarely survive combination therapy and within-host competition is very weak among parasites. The model focuses on the early phase of such unsuccessful recurrent mutations. This ends in the rare event of mutants enriching in an infected individual from which the successful spread of resistance over the entire population is initiated. By computer simulations, the waiting time until the establishment of resistant parasites is analysed. Resistance spreads quickly following the first appearance of a host infected predominantly by mutant parasites. This occurs either through a rare transmission of a resistant parasite to an uninfected host or through a rare failure of drugs in removing ""transient"" mutant alleles. The emergence of resistance is delayed with lower mutation rate, earlier treatment, higher metabolic cost of resistance, longer duration of high drug dose, and higher drug efficacy causing a stronger reduction in the sensitive and resistant parasites' fitnesses. Overall, contrary to other studies' proposition, the current model based on absolute fitness suggests that aggressive drug treatment delays the emergence of drug resistance."

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for more than 90 percent of esophageal cancers. Genetic factors probably play an important role in the ESCC carcinogenesis.We conducted a hospital based case-control study to evaluate functional hTERT rs2736098 G>A and TERT-CLPTM1L rs401681 C>T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of ESCC. Six hundred and twenty-nine ESCC cases and 686 controls were recruited. Their genotypes were determined using the ligation detection reaction (LDR) method.When the TERT-CLPTM1L rs401681 CC homozygote genotype was used as the reference group, the CT genotype was associated with a significantly decreased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.58-0.94, p = 0.012); the CT/TT variants were associated with a 26% decreased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.59-0.93, P = 0.009). The significantly decreased risk of ESCC associated with the TERT-CLPTM1L rs401681 C>T polymorphism was associated with male sex, young age (<63 years in our study) and alcohol consumption. No association between the hTERT rs2736098 G>A polymorphism and ESCC risk was observed.TERT-CLPTM1L rs401681 CT and CT/TT genotypes were associated with decreased risk of ESCC, particularly among men, young patients and those reported to be drinkers. However, our results are preliminary conclusions. Larger studies with more rigorous study designs are required to confirm the current findings."
https://openalex.org/W2043599583,"Acanthamoeba are opportunistic protozoan pathogens that may lead to sight-threatening keratitis and fatal granulomatous encephalitis. The successful prognosis requires early diagnosis and differentiation of pathogenic Acanthamoeba followed by aggressive treatment regimen. The plasma membrane of Acanthamoeba consists of 25% phospholipids (PL). The presence of C20 and, recently reported, 28- and 30-carbon fatty acyl residues is characteristic of amoeba PL. A detailed knowledge about this unusual PL composition could help to differentiate Acanthamoeba from other parasites, e.g. bacteria and develop more efficient treatment strategies. Therefore, the detailed PL composition of Acanthamoeba castellanii was investigated by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Normal and reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection was used for detailed characterization of the fatty acyl composition of each detected PL. The most abundant fatty acyl residues in each PL class were octadecanoyl (18∶0), octadecenoyl (18∶1 Δ9) and hexadecanoyl (16∶0). However, some selected PLs contained also very long fatty acyl chains: the presence of 28- and 30-carbon fatty acyl residues was confirmed in phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid and cardiolipin. The majority of these fatty acyl residues were also identified in PE that resulted in the following composition: 28∶1/20∶2, 30∶2/18∶1, 28∶0/20∶2, 30∶2/20∶4 and 30∶3/20∶3. The PL of amoebae are significantly different in comparison to other cells: we describe here for the first time unusual, very long chain fatty acids with Δ5-unsaturation (30∶35,21,24) and 30∶221,24 localized exclusively in specific phospholipid classes of A. castellanii protozoa that could serve as specific biomarkers for the presence of these microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W2064173708,"Although smokeless tobacco (SLT) use is prevalent in South Asian countries including Bangladesh, information about the pattern and correlates of SLT use is scarce. This study described the pattern and predictors of SLT use among Bangladeshi adults.The data for this study were derived from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Bangladesh (ITC BD) Survey, a prospective cohort survey of a nationally representative sample of smokers and non-smokers, conducted during November 2011 and May 2012. The study included 5522 adults aged 15 or above. We used multiple logistic regression models to identify predictors of SLT use.Of the respondents (N = 5522), 20% were SLT users. In general, SLT use was significantly higher among women, the illiterate and residents of the Dhaka slums or non-tribal/non-border areas outside Dhaka; SLT use increased with age. Several attitudinal factors were also associated with SLT use. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed several predictors of SLT use: being female (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.18-3.24), an increasing age, being a resident of a Dhaka slum (OR = 5.86; 95% CI: 3.73-9.21) or non-tribal/non-border areas outside Dhaka (OR = 3.42; 95% CI: 1.94-6.03), being illiterate (OR = 3.37; 95% CI: 1.99-5.71), holding positive opinion towards societal approval of SLT use (OR = 5.84; 95% CI: 3.38-10.09), holding positive opinion towards SLT use by women (OR = 2.63; 95% CI: 1.53-4.54), believing that SLT is addictive (OR = 2.96; 95% CI: 1.51-5.81), and believing SLT is less harmful than bidi (OR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.36-3.62).The findings suggest that coordinated efforts of governmental and non-governmental organizations, targeting both smoked tobacco and SLT use reduction and cessation, could be modified to reach each level of population including those who are marginalized, female, less educated and elderly. As most tobacco control programs in Bangladesh target mainly cigarette or bidi smoking, coordinated programs are needed that will also include SLT use within the tobacco control policy and prevention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2067344117,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the HIV co-infected population. Interferon-alpha (IFN-α) remains a major component of anti-HCV therapy despite its deleterious effects on the immune system. Furthermore, IFN-α was recently shown to diminish the size of the latent HIV reservoir. The objectives of this study were to monitor the impact of IFN-α on T cell phenotype and proliferation of HIV and HCV-specific T cells during IFN therapy, and to identify immune markers that can predict the response to IFN in HICV/HIV co-infected patients. We performed longitudinal analyses of T cell numbers, phenotype and function in co-infected patients undergoing IFN-α therapy with different outcomes including IFN-α non-responders (NR) (n = 9) and patients who achieved sustained virologic response (SVR) (n = 19). We examined the expression of activation (CD38, HLA-DR), functional (CD127) and exhaustion markers (PD1, Tim-3, CD160 and CD244) on total CD4 and CD8 T cells before, during and after therapy. In addition, we examined the HIV- and HCV-specific proliferative responses against HIV-p24 and HCV-NS3 proteins. Frequencies of CD127+ CD4 T cells were higher in SVR than in NR patients at baseline. An increase in CD127 expression on CD8 T cells was observed after IFN-α therapy in all patients. In addition, CD8 T cells from NR patients expressed a higher exhaustion status at baseline. Finally, SVR patients exhibited higher proliferative response against both HIV and HCV antigens at baseline. Altogether, SVR correlated with higher expression of CD127, lower T cell exhaustion status and better HIV and HCV proliferative responses at baseline. Such factors might be used as non-invasive methods to predict the success of IFN–based therapies in co-infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2137031864,"The widely used pathway-based approach for interpreting Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS), assumes that since function is executed through the interactions of multiple genes, different perturbations of the same pathway would result in a similar phenotype. This assumption, however, was not systemically assessed on a large scale. To determine whether SNPs associated with a given complex phenotype affect the same pathways more than expected by chance, we analyzed 368 phenotypes that were studied in >5000 GWAS. We found 216 significant phenotype-pathway associations between 70 of the phenotypes we analyzed and known pathways. We also report 391 strong phenotype-phenotype associations between phenotypes that are affected by the same pathways. While some of these associations confirm previously reported connections, others are new and could shed light on the molecular basis of these diseases. Our findings confirm that phenotype-associated SNPs cluster into pathways much more than expected by chance. However, this is true for <20% (70/368) of the phenotypes. Different types of phenotypes show markedly different tendencies: Virtually all autoimmune phenotypes show strong clustering of SNPs into pathways, while most cancers and metabolic conditions, and all electrophysiological phenotypes, could not be significantly associated with any pathway despite being significantly associated with a large number of SNPs. While this may be due to missing data, it may also suggest that these phenotypes could result only from perturbations of specific genes and not from other perturbations of the same pathway. Further analysis of pathway-associated versus gene-associated phenotypes is, therefore, needed in order to understand disease etiology and in order to promote better drug target selection."

https://openalex.org/W2052756074,"The function and capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is determined by multiple processes ranging from the local regulation of peptide translation, translocation, and folding, to global changes in lipid composition. ER homeostasis thus requires complex interactions amongst numerous cellular components. However, describing the networks that maintain ER function during changes in cell behavior and environmental fluctuations has, to date, proven difficult. Here we perform a systems-level analysis of ER homeostasis, and find that although signaling networks that regulate ER function have a largely modular architecture, the TORC1-SREBP signaling axis is a central node that integrates signals emanating from different sub-networks. TORC1-SREBP promotes ER homeostasis by regulating phospholipid biosynthesis and driving changes in ER morphology. In particular, our network model shows TORC1-SREBP serves to integrate signals promoting growth and G1-S progression in order to maintain ER function during cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2076168481,"A functional voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channel comprises four pore-forming α-subunits, and only members of the same Kv channel subfamily may co-assemble to form heterotetramers. The ether-à-go-go family of Kv channels (KCNH) encompasses three distinct subfamilies: Eag (Kv10), Erg (Kv11), and Elk (Kv12). Members of different ether-à-go-go subfamilies, such as Eag and Erg, fail to form heterotetramers. Although a short stretch of amino acid sequences in the distal C-terminal section has been implicated in subfamily-specific subunit assembly, it remains unclear whether this region serves as the sole and/or principal subfamily recognition domain for Eag and Erg. Here we aim to ascertain the structural basis underlying the subfamily specificity of ether-à-go-go channels by generating various chimeric constructs between rat Eag1 and human Erg subunits. Biochemical and electrophysiological characterizations of the subunit interaction properties of a series of different chimeric and truncation constructs over the C terminus suggested that the putative C-terminal recognition domain is dispensable for subfamily-specific assembly. Further chimeric analyses over the N terminus revealed that the N-terminal region may also harbor a subfamily recognition domain. Importantly, exchanging either the N-terminal or the C-terminal domain alone led to a virtual loss of the intersubfamily assembly boundary. By contrast, simultaneously swapping both recognition domains resulted in a reversal of subfamily specificity. Our observations are consistent with the notion that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal recognition domains are required to sustain the subfamily-specific assembly of rat Eag1 and human Erg."
https://openalex.org/W2047439469,"Oscillations in electrical activity are a characteristic feature of many brain networks and display a wide variety of temporal patterns. A network may express a single oscillation frequency, alternate between two or more distinct frequencies, or continually express multiple frequencies. In addition, oscillation amplitude may fluctuate over time. The origin of this complex repertoire of activity remains unclear. Different cortical layers often produce distinct oscillation frequencies. To investigate whether interactions between different networks could contribute to the variety of oscillation patterns, we created two model networks, one generating on its own a relatively slow frequency (20 Hz; slow network) and one generating a fast frequency (32 Hz; fast network). Taking either the slow or the fast network as source network projecting connections to the other, or target, network, we systematically investigated how type and strength of inter-network connections affected target network activity. For high inter-network connection strengths, we found that the slow network was more effective at completely imposing its rhythm on the fast network than the other way around. The strongest entrainment occurred when excitatory cells of the slow network projected to excitatory or inhibitory cells of the fast network. The fast network most strongly imposed its rhythm on the slow network when its excitatory cells projected to excitatory cells of the slow network. Interestingly, for lower inter-network connection strengths, multiple frequencies coexisted in the target network. Just as observed in rat prefrontal cortex, the target network could express multiple frequencies at the same time, alternate between two distinct oscillation frequencies, or express a single frequency with alternating episodes of high and low amplitude. Together, our results suggest that input from other oscillating networks may markedly alter a network's frequency spectrum and may partly be responsible for the rich repertoire of temporal oscillation patterns observed in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1971814749,"Studying human behavior in response to large-scale catastrophic events, particularly how moral challenges would be undertaken under extreme conditions, is an important preoccupation for contemporary scientists and decision leaders. However, researching this issue was hindered by the lack of readily available models. Immersive virtual worlds could represent a solution, by providing ways to test human behavior in controlled life-threatening situations. Using a massively multi-player zombie apocalypse setting, we analysed spontaneously reported feelings of guilt following ethically questionable actions related to survival. The occurrence and magnitude of guilt depended on the nature of the consequences of the action. Furthermore, feelings of guilt predicted long-lasting changes in behavior, displayed as compensatory actions. Finally, actions inflicting immediate harm to others appeared mostly prompted by panic and were more commonly regretted. Thus, extreme conditions trigger a reduction of the impact of ethical norms in decision making, although awareness of ethicality is retained to a surprising extent."

Here, we sought to identify patterns of gene expression that determine the NPMI during inflorescence differentiation. We monitored gene expression profiles in the main inflorescence of two B. napus F6 RIL pools, each composed of nine lines with a low or high NPMI, and their parental lines, Zhongshuang 11 (ZS11) and 73290, using a Brassica 90K elements oligonucleotide array. We identified 4,805 genes that were differentially expressed (≥1.5 fold-change) between the low- and high-NPMI samples. Of these, 82.8% had been annotated and 17.2% shared no significant homology with any known genes. About 31 enriched GO clusters were identified amongst the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including those involved in hormone responses, development regulation, carbohydrate metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription regulation. Furthermore, 92.8% of the DEGs mapped to chromosomes that originated from B. rapa and B. oleracea, and 1.6% of the DEGs co-localized with two QTL intervals (PMI10 and PMI11) known to be associated with the NPMI. Overexpression of BnTPI, which co-localized with PMI10, in Arabidopsis suggested that this gene increases the NPMI. This study provides insight into the molecular factors underlying inflorescence architecture, NPMI determination and, consequently, seed yield in B. napus."
https://openalex.org/W2075622490,"Various histone modifications are widely associated with gene expression, but their functional selectivity at individual genes remains to be characterized. Here, we identify widespread differences between genome-wide patterns of two prominent marks, H3K9ac and H3K4me3, in budding yeasts. As well as characteristic gene profiles, relative modification levels vary significantly amongst genes, irrespective of expression. Interestingly, we show that these differences couple to contrasting features: higher methylation to essential, periodically expressed, 'DPN' (Depleted Proximal Nucleosome) genes, and higher acetylation to non-essential, responsive, 'OPN' (Occupied Proximal Nucleosome) genes. Thus, H3K4me3 may generally associate with expression stability, and H3K9ac, with variability. To evaluate this notion, we examine their association with expression divergence between the closely related species, S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. Although individually well conserved at orthologous genes, changes between modifications are mostly uncorrelated, indicating largely non-overlapping regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we find that inter-species differences in methylation, but not acetylation, are well correlated with expression changes, thereby proposing H3K4me3 as a candidate regulator of expression divergence. Taken together, our results suggest distinct evolutionary roles for expression-linked modifications, wherein H3K4me3 may contribute to stabilize average expression, whilst H3K9ac associates with more indirect aspects such as responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2086486726,"Caliciviruses use reinitiation of translation governed by a 'termination upstream ribosomal binding site' (TURBS) for expression of their minor capsid protein VP2. Mutation analysis allowed to identify sequences surrounding the translational start/stop site of the feline calicivirus (FCV) that fine tune reinitiation frequency. A selection of these changes was introduced into the infectious FCV cDNA clone to check the influence of altered VP2 levels on virus replication. In addition, full length constructs were established that displayed a conformation, in which VP2 expression occurred under control of a duplicated subgenomic promoter. Viable viruses recovered from such constructs revealed a rather broad range of VP2 expression levels but comparable growth kinetics showing that caliciviruses can tolerate gross changes of the VP2 expression level."
https://openalex.org/W2013620174,"Background Efforts to improve the diagnosis, prognosis and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa) are relevant. Gleason score (GSc) overestimation may subject individuals to unnecessary aggressive treatment. We aimed to use stereology in PCa evaluations and investigate whether mean nuclear volume (MNV) correlates with the Gleason primary pattern (Gpp) and to improve the subjective GSc to obtain an objective and reliable method without inter-observer dissension. Methods We identified 74 radical prostatectomy specimens that were divided into six groups based on Gpp, from 3 to 5. Controls (C) were designed in paired non-tumor regions of the same specimens. MNV was estimated using the “point-sampled intercepts” method. Differences in MNV among the C groups and the Gpp groups were tested with the Kruskall-Wallis test and Dunn post-hoc test. Differences between each Gpp group and its control counterpart were tested with the Wilcoxon test. Correlations were evaluated with the Spearman rank correlation (R[Spearman]). Results The correlations between prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and GSc (R[Spearman] of 0.76) and between PSA and MNV (R[Spearman] of 0.78) were moderately strong and highly significant, and the correlation between MNV and Gpp (R[Spearman] of 0.53) was moderate and highly significant. MNV was significantly greater in cancerous regions than in paired-control regions. Limitations included sample size. Conclusions Proper planning of a study, as well as the availability of equipment and software for morphological quantification, can provide incentive to quickly and accurately estimate MNV as an adjunct parameter in the assessment of PCa. Current data are in favor of the use of MNV associated with GSc and PSA in the assessment of PCa."

To achieve lesion-specific visualization of tumors by MRI, we investigated the availability of a novel polymer-based tracer. Although the 13C nucleus is a candidate for a detection nucleus because of its low background signal in the body, the low magnetic resonance sensitivity of the nucleus needs to be resolved before developing a 13C-based tracer. In order to overcome this problem, we enriched polyethylene glycol (PEG), a biocompatible polymer, with 13C atoms. 13C-PEG40,000 (13C-PEG with an average molecular weight of 40 kDa) emitted a single 13C signal with a high signal-to-noise ratio due to its ability to maintain signal sharpness, as was confirmed by in vivo investigation, and displayed a chemical shift sufficiently distinct from that of endogenous fat. 13C-PEG40,000 intravenously injected into mice showed long retention in circulation, leading to its effective accumulation in tumors reflecting the well-known phenomenon that macromolecules accumulate in tumors because of leaky tumor capillaries. These properties of 13C-PEG40,000 allowed visualization of tumors in mice by 13C spectroscopic imaging. These findings suggest that a technique based on 13C-PEG is a promising strategy for tumor detection."

Two structures of almost complete receptors reveal the intricate complexity of these large, multi-domain molecular machines.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors function by opening a transmembrane ion channel upon binding of glutamate. Eric Gouaux and colleagues report the X-ray crystal structure of the GluN1–GluN2B N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a heterotetrameric complex comprised of a glycine-binding GluN1 subunit and a glutamate-binding GluN2 subunit. Activation of the receptor opens a cation-selective, calcium-permeable channel, thereby causing further depolarization of the cell membrane and influx of calcium. The structure of this membrane protein was obtained in complex with the allosteric inhibitor Ro25-6981, the channel blocker MK-801, and with two partial agonists. The overall structure of this membrane protein is mushroom-like, with the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits arranged as a dimer-of-dimers in a 1-2-1-2 fashion."
