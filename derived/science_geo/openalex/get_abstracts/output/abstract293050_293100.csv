https://openalex.org/W2066999391,"Many kinds of sediment bedforms are presumed to trend either normal or parallel to the direction of sediment transport. For this reason, the trend of bedforms observed by remote sensing or by field observations is commonly used as an indicator of the direction of sediment transport. Such presumptions regarding bedform trend were tested experimentally in bidirectional flows by rotating a sand-covered board in steady winds. Transverse, oblique, and longitudinal bedforms were created by changing only two parameters: the angle between the two winds and the proportions of sand transported in the two directions. Regardless of whether the experimental bedforms were transverse, oblique, or longitudinal (as defined by the bedform trend relative to the resultant transport direction), they all had trends that yielded the maximum gross transport across the bedforms. The fact that many of the experimental bedforms were neither transverse nor parallel to the resultant transport direction suggests that transport directions cannot be accurately determined by presuming such alignment."

From about 9500 to 4500 years ago, lower Wadi Howar flowed through an environment characterized by numerous ground water outlets and freshwater lakes. Savanna fauna and cattle-herders occupied this region, which today receives at most 25 millimeters of rainfall per year. At that period the southern edge of the eastern Sahara was some 500 kilometers further north than today and ground water resources were recharged for the last time."

https://openalex.org/W2064590981,"AS WALL STREET TRACKS THE HEALTH OF AMERICAN BUSIness by monitoring indicators of economic productivity, so must scientists, parents, and taxpayers heed leading indicators of scientific productivity. Since mathematics is the foundation discipline for science, the state of mathematics education is a crucial predictor of future national strength in science and technology. Evidence suggests that our mathematics classrooms, like our smokestack industries, no longer provide adequate support for modern society. They deliver neither the mathematical foundation required for scientific research nor the quantitative literacy necessary for a democratic society. International Comparisons Because of its widespread utility in industrial, military, and scientific applications, mathematics is a crucial indicator of future economic competitiveness. The evidence is overwhelming, however, that the mathematics yield of U.S. schools-the sum total of mathematics learned by all students-is substantially less than that of other industrialized nations. Current levels of achievement in the United States are unacceptably low. Our mathematics curriculum is not what it ought to be, nor is it even close to what it could be. By looking downward through the grades, we can foresee the poor quality of mathematical understanding of future generations of scientists: a Non-U.S. citizens who take the Graduate Record Examination in mathematics average 100 points higher than U.S. students. The performance gap is twice as high in mathematics as in any other field-the next highest being in physics, the most mathematical of the sciences (1). a The mathematics achievement of the top 5% of twelfth grade students is lower in the United States than in other industrialized nations. The average twelfth grade mathematics student in Japan outperforms 95% of comparable U.S. twelfth graders (2). * U.S. eighth graders, who are about average in rote computation, are well below international norms in solving problems that require higher order thinking skills (2). Indeed, as the back-tobasics movement has flourished in the last 15 years, the ability of U.S. students to think (rather than just to memorize) has declined accordingly. * For fifth graders, the highest average mathematics achievement in typical U.S. schools (in Chicago and Minneapolis) is below the lowest average scores from similar schools in China (Beijing) and Japan (Sendai). Only one of the top 100 students in the fifth grade in these recent international studies was an American (3). * Even in kindergarten and first grade, differences emerge. Japanese children enter school ahead of U.S. children in mathematical skills. Only 15 of the top 100 first graders in a U.S.-China-Japan study were American. The unanimity of these studies, from different countries and different investigators, underscores their significance. Contrary to popular myth, the United States is not among the world leaders in the percentage of its youth who receive advanced education in mathematics. In the eighth grade, virtually all students take mathematics in all industrialized countries. At the twelfth grade level, most countries (including the United States) enroll about 12 to 15% of 18-year-olds in advanced mathematics courses, although in some countries (such as Hungary) the number is as high as 50%. These studies also show that there is no consistent correlation internationally between student achievement and time spent in mathematics instruction. Except in elementary school, where U.S. emphasis on mathematics is unusually light, many countries devote less classroom time to mathematics than we do. Similarly, average class size from country to country seems to be quite unrelated to achievement. Since the cultural diversity of American society is so much greater than that of most other countries, many believe that lower U.S. scores are due to the greater challenge of achieving excellence in a diverse society. Yet even in culturally homogeneous Minneapolisarea schools, average performance is well below comparable schools in China and Japan. Analysis of the data involved in these studies dispels many simplistic explanations for poor U.S. performance. Lower U.S. scores are not due simply to averages taken over a higher percentage of our population, nor are they due to less contact time in schools, or to the broadening effects of a heterogeneous population. As there are no simple causes, there are no simple solutions to the problem of poor performance."
https://openalex.org/W1996326879,"The discovery of a turtle in the Early Jurassic(185 million years before present) Kayenta Formation of northeastern Arizona provides significant evidence about the origin of modern turtles. This new taxon possesses many of the primitive features expected in the hypothetical common ancestor of pleurodires and cryptodires, the two groups of modern turtles. It is identified as the oldest known cryptodire because of the presence of a distinctive cryptodiran jaw mechanism consisting of a trochlea over the otic chamber that redirects the line of action of the adductor muscle. Aquatic habits appear to have developed very early in turtle evolution. Kayentachelys extends the known record of cryptodires back at least 45 million years and documents a very early stage in the evolution of modern turtles."

https://openalex.org/W1965721966,"Infusion of angiotensin or renin in small quantities affects the sympathetic nervous system so that responses are increased to either drugs or reflexes that cause release of norepinephrine at nerve endings. Response to injected norepinephrine is relatively unchanged. This action of angiotensin is dependent upon an intact sympathetic nervous system. The direct vasoconstrictor action of angiotensin is not an essential part of the enhanced response. The phenomenon was shown to have relevance to acute and chronic experimental renal hypertension in dogs by the fact that in both the pressor response to tyramine was enhanced. We believe that the ability of angiotensin to intensify the effect of normal neurogenic vasomotor activity, along with an upward reset of the carotid sinus buffer mechanism, might account importantly for the neurogenic component of renal hypertension."

In an experiment to demonstrate this long-range utility, the release of 84 grams of methane-21 was detected at distances of 1500 to about 2500 kilometers at concentrations of about 1 part in 2 x 10(16) parts (by volume) in the air by a technique in which methane was separated and the methane-21 content was measured with a mass spectrometer."
https://openalex.org/W2126056617,"Although making liquid nitrogen-temperature superconductors is easy enough that high school science projects already feature them, researchers still have little idea how the new ceramic oxides work and therefore little guidance for improving them. At the International Workshop on Novel Mechanisms of Superconductivity, held from 22 to 26 June in Berkeley, California, theorists reviewed a host of competing explanations of how these materials come by their remarkable properties, but they could not, get far in sifting through the candidates for the best one. One cause of the unsettled situation is that theorists have not yet pushed their models far enough to make many specific predictions about physical properties and therefore to provide a reason to choose one theory over another. But experimental data for comparison with theory are lacking, too. For example, experimentalists are just now succeeding in being able to grow single crystals and thin films of the ceramic oxide superconductors, whose properties were shown at the workshop to be highly anisotropic. Measurements already made on the polycrystalline sintered material available up to now are difficult to interpret and therefore need to be repeated on good-quality crystals and films, where the variation of properties with crystallographic orientation can be mapped out. Given the high level of Japanese activity in the field, it was surprising that no researchers from industrial laboratories in Japan presented their findings at the workshop. In the light of a budding international competition in commercializing superconductors, some American scientists interpreted the absence as an attempt to protect proprietary advances. A more pleasant surprise was the attendance of a delegation of six Soviet scientists, although one of the fathers of superconductivity theory, Vitaly Ginzburg of the P.N.Lebedev Institute of Physics in Moscow, who was expected, did not come."

These, together with older sections, now slumped or no longer exposed, offer convincing evidence of two glaciations of the Rockford area, the first of Illinoian age and the second of early Wisconsin (Farmdale) age. The sections further suggest that the greater part of the drift fill in Ancient Rock River Valley is Illinoian, and that this is overlain by a relatively thin mantle of Farmdale drift."

https://openalex.org/W2028438449,"We disagree with the statements in Andrew Lawler's article “U.S. neutron scientists settle for less” concerning the availability of cold neutrons at pulsed neutron sources (PSs) (News & Comment, [9 Aug., p. 728][1]) that cold neutron production is merely a “theoretical possibility” and that the associated technology lags behind that for reactors.

Because pulsed sources produce high fluxes of “hot” neutrons in a natural way, perhaps not everyone is aware of the success with which cold neutrons are being produced and exploited at PSs. It is actually easier to produce cold neutrons at a PS than at a reactor. The overall heat load is much less for the same peak neutron flux, and the required moderators are small in dimension and can usually be inserted into the neighborhood of the spallation target in a simple way. Thus, a moderator change can be accomplished in a few weeks. The cold moderator design, construction, and installation can be done within normal operating budgets. This is in contrast to the case for reactors, where the installation of a cold moderator is a major project requiring separate funding and usually a significant shutdown for installation. Moreover, the spectral and pulse characteristics can be tailored to fit applications.

The existing pulsed spallation neutron sources owe much of their success to cold moderator technology. The scientific problems that have been addressed have been in the same areas as those addressed using reactor-based cold sources. The areas in question, as is typical for neutron beam exploitation in general, are extraordinarily diverse and range from surface science and chemical spectroscopy to magnetism. The possibilities inherent in the time structure of PS cold moderator performance represent opportunities for optimization beyond those of steady-source moderators that are still being explored.

https://openalex.org/W2171515554,"The quote (Random Samples, 11 Oct., p. 183) from Norman Levitt's book The Flight from Science and Reason ([1][1]) exhibits a flight from reason equivalent to that apparent in many postmodernistic critiques of “science.” Specifically, “the idea that the cultural critic can meaningfully analyze …” anything or everything does not follow from the premise that “everything that people do is ‘cultural.’” It may be “distinctly weird to listen to pronouncements on the nature of mathematics from the lips of someone who cannot tell you what a complex number is,” but it does not follow that those pronouncements have no empirical validity. The explicit methods of study that constitute “science” were created to address the question of how we can establish empirical validity. This question arises only because all human understanding is “culture.”
