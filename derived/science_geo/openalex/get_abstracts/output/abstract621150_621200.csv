https://openalex.org/W2951879551,"Marchantia polymorpha is one of the model species of basal land plants. Although CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has already been demonstrated for this plant, the efficiency was too low to apply to functional analysis. In this study, we show the establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing vectors with high efficiency for both construction and genome editing. Codon optimization of Cas9 to Arabidopsis achieved over 70% genome editing efficiency at two loci tested. Systematic assessment revealed that guide sequences of 17 nt or shorter dramatically decreased this efficiency. We also demonstrated that a combinatorial use of this system and a floxed complementation construct enabled conditional analysis of a nearly essential gene. This study reports that simple, rapid, and efficient genome editing is feasible with the series of developed vectors."
https://openalex.org/W2899041273,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), especially non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease commonly associated with hepatic fibrosis. NASH patients have an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An altered retinol metabolism is one of the pathways involved in the process of hepatic fibrosis, and enzymes involved in retinol metabolism have been associated with HCC. We aimed to determine the association between plasma retinol levels and hepatic expression of genes related to retinol metabolism, as well as to assess the hepatic expression of transcription factors regulated by retinoic acid in patients with NAFLD. Cross-sectional study where hepatic gene expression (Illumina microarray) and plasma retinol levels (HPLC) were measured in 17 patients with simple steatosis (SS), 15 with NASH, and 22 living liver donors (LD) as controls. Plasma retinol levels were higher in SS (1.53 ± 0.44 μmol/L) and NASH (1.51 ± 0.56 μmol/L) compared to LD (1.21 ± 0.38 μmol/L; p<0.05). AKR1B10 was highly overexpressed in NASH compared to SS (+6.2-fold) and LD (+9.9-fold; p = 4.89E-11). Retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A2 (ALDH1A2) and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family, member A3 (ALDH1A3), key enzymes for retinoic acid synthesis, were underexpressed in SS (-1.48 and -2.3-fold, respectively) and NASH (-1.47 and -2.6-fold, respectively) versus LD. In NASH, hepatic ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3 were underexpressed and inversely correlated with plasma retinol levels, which may reduce retinoic acid in the liver. This, in addition to changes in expression of other genes involved in retinol metabolism, suggests a role for altered retinol homeostasis in NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2898931259,"Biological control is a promising measure in the control of plant disease. In the present study, we isolated 13 endophytic strains from Angelica dahurica. Among them, an endophytic strain which was named GYLH001 exhibited remarkable activity against Magnaporthe oryzae. 16S rRNA sequence analysis, biochemical and physiological proved that it is Bacillus tequilensis. The sterilized culture filtrate of GYLH001 can inhibit the growth of M.oryzae, which suggests the presence of secondary metabolites. Proved by experiment, GYLH001 can produce cellulase, protease, gelatinase, indole-3-acetic acid and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase. In addition, the temperature experiment showed that secondary metabolites produced by GYLH001 had good thermal stability. They can remain activity even heated at 100°C for 30 min. They also had good acid-resistance in heavily acidic condition. But under alkaline condition, the antifungal effect decreased significantly. By simulative field tests, the spraying of GYLH001 spore solution could prevent and treat rice blast. Through continuous separation and purification of sterilized culture filtrate and identification by mass spectrometry, the molecular weight of an active substance is 364.26. In the control of rice blast, B. tequilensis GYLH001 has potential as a biological control agent in agriculture."
https://openalex.org/W2952566600,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite with a predation-mediated transmission cycle between rodents and felines. Intermediate hosts acquire Toxoplasma by eating parasite cysts which invade the small intestine, disseminate systemically and finally establish host life-long chronic infection in brain and muscles. Here we show that Toxoplasma infection can trigger a severe form of sustained cachexia: a disease of progressive lean weight loss that is a causal predictor of mortality in cancer, chronic disease and many infections. Toxoplasma cachexia is characterized by acute anorexia, systemic inflammation and loss of 20% body mass. Although mice recover from symptoms of peak sickness, they fail to regain muscle mass or visceral adipose depots. We asked whether the damage to the intestinal microenvironment observed at acute time points was sustained in chronic infection and could thereby play a role in sustaining cachexia. We found that parasites replicate in the same region of the distal jejunum/proximal ileum throughout acute infection, inducing the development of secondary lymphoid structures and severe, regional inflammation. Small intestine pathology was resolved by 5 weeks post-infection. However, changes in the commensal populations, notably an outgrowth of Clostridia spp., were sustained in chronic infection. Importantly, uninfected animals co-housed with infected mice display similar changes in commensal microflora but never display symptoms of cachexia, indicating that altered commensals are not sufficient to explain the cachexia phenotype alone. These studies indicate that Toxoplasma infection is a novel and robust model to study the immune-metabolic interactions that contribute to chronic cachexia development, pathology and potential reversal."
https://openalex.org/W2899175060,"Thoroughbred horses are finely-tuned athletes with a high aerobic capacity relative to skeletal muscle mass, attributable to centuries of genetic selection for speed and stamina. Polymorphisms in the myostatin gene (MSTN), a pronounced inhibitor of skeletal muscle growth, have been shown to almost singularly account for gene-based race distance aptitude in racehorses. In Thoroughbreds, two MSTN polymorphisms, a single nucleotide variation in the first intron (SNP g.66493737C>T) and a non-coding transposable element within the promoter region (a 227 bp SINE insertion) are of particular interest. Until now, it has not been clear which of these variants affect skeletal muscle phenotypes or whether both can impact racing performance. In a large cohort of Thoroughbreds, we observed a complete concordance between the SNP and the SINE insertion. By means of in vitro assays in C2C12 myoblasts, we isolated the SNP variant from the SINE polymorphism and showed the latter is exclusively responsible for adversely affecting transcription initiation and gene expression thereby limiting myostatin protein production. Mapping the MSTN transcription start site in horse skeletal muscle likewise revealed anomalous transcription initiation in the presence of the SINE insertion. Our data provides mechanistic evidence that the SINE insertion uniquely accounts for the MSTN “speed gene” effect on race distance aptitude in the Thoroughbred horse."
https://openalex.org/W2899490952,"Efforts to conserve bats in the western United States have long been impeded by a lack of information on their winter whereabouts, particularly bats in the genus Myotis. The recent arrival of white-nose syndrome in western North America has increased the urgency to characterize winter roost habitats in this region. We compiled 4,549 winter bat survey records from 2,888 unique structures across 11 western states. Myotis bats were reported from 18.5% of structures with 95% of aggregations composed of ≤10 individuals. Only 11 structures contained ≥100 Myotis individuals and 6 contained ≥500 individuals. Townsend’s big-eared bat (Corynorhinus townsendii) were reported from 38% of structures, with 72% of aggregations composed of ≤10 individuals. Aggregations of ≥100 Townsend’s big-eared bats were observed at 41 different caves or mines across 9 states. We used zero-inflated negative binomial regression to explore biogeographic patterns of winter roost counts. Myotis counts were greater in caves than mines, in more recent years, and in more easterly longitudes, northerly latitudes, higher elevations, and in areas with higher surface temperatures and lower precipitation. Townsend’s big-eared bat counts were greater in caves, during more recent years, and in more westerly longitudes. Karst topography was associated with higher Townsend’s big-eared bat counts but did not appear to influence Myotis counts. We found stable or slightly-increasing trends over time in counts for both Myotis and Townsend’s big-eared bats from 82 hibernacula surveyed ≥5 winters since 1990. Highly-dispersed winter roosting of Myotis in the western USA complicates efforts to monitor population trends and impacts of disease. However, our results reveal opportunities to monitor winter population status of Townsend’s big-eared bats across this region."
https://openalex.org/W2899232187,"Exosomes, the smallest subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs), have recently attracted much attention in the scientific community. Their involvement in intercellular communication and molecular reprogramming of different cell types created a demand for a stringent characterization of the proteome which exosomes carry and deliver to recipient cells. Mass spectrometry (MS) has been extensively used for exosome protein profiling. Unfortunately, no standards have been established for exosome isolation and their preparation for MS, leading to accumulation of artefactual data. These include the presence of high-abundance exosome-contaminating serum proteins in culture media which mask low-abundance exosome-specific components, isolation methods that fail to yield “pure” vesicles or variability in protein solubilization protocols. There is an unmet need for the development of standards for exosome generation, harvesting, and isolation from cellular supernatants and for optimization of protein extraction methods before proteomics analysis by MS. In this communication, we illustrate the existing problems in this field and provide a set of recommendations that are expected to harmonize exosome processing for MS and provide the faithful picture of the proteomes carried by exosomes. The recommended workflow for effective and specific identification of proteins in exosomes released by the low number of cells involves culturing cells in medium with a reduced concentration of exosome-depleted serum, purification of exosomes by size-exclusion chromatography, a combination of different protein extraction method and removal of serum-derived proteins from the final dataset using an appropriate sample of cell-unexposed medium as a control. Application of this method allowed detection of >250 vesicle-specific proteins in exosomes from 10 mL of culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W2898712829,"On many dairy farms cows are kept indoors. Providing outdoor access is often considered desirable, but housing can protect animals from aversive climatic conditions. For example, by providing shade and fans, indoor housing can protect cows from heat stress they might otherwise experience on open pasture. This study tested how public attitudes to cattle rearing varied when participants were experimentally assigned to different scenarios using a 2 x 2 factorial design varying pasture versus indoor housing with or without heat stress. Participants (n = 581) were randomly assigned to a single scenario, and attitudes in response to the scenario were measured using a Likert scale (1 = ""strongly disagree"" to 5 = ""strongly agree""). We also asked open-ended questions allowing participants to explain their responses. Participants responded most positively to the scenario that provided both pasture access and protection from heat stress (Likert 4.1±0.08), and least positively to scenario with indoor housing and heat stress (Likert 2.2±0.08). However, when the different animal welfare attributes were in conflict (i.e. naturalness as provided by pasture, and biological functioning/affective state as associated with protection from heat stress), participants placed priority on the latter: they were more supportive of the scenario providing indoor housing that protected cows from heat stress (Likert 3.5±0.08), than they were of a pasture rearing system that exposed cows to heat stress (Likert 2.4±0.08). Open-ended responses indicated that participants viewed the lack of protection from heat stress as a failure in the farmer's duty of care towards the cow. We conclude that participants valued both access to pasture and protection from heat stress for dairy cows, but prioritized protecting animal from heat stress when these features were in conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2899287545,"Retention forestry aims to mitigate impacts of native forestry on biodiversity, but data are limited on its effectiveness for threatened species. We used acoustics to investigate the resilience of a folivorous marsupial, the koala Phascolarctos cinereus, to timber harvesting where a key mitigation practice is landscape exclusion of harvesting. We deployed acoustic recorders at 171 sites to record male bellows (~14,640 hours) for use in occupancy modelling and for comparisons of bellow rate (bellows night-1). Surveys targeted modelled medium-high quality habitat, with sites stratified by time since logging and logging intensity, including old growth as a reference. After scanning recordings with software to identify koala bellows, we found a high probability of detection (~0.45 per night), but this varied with minimum temperature and recorder type. Naïve occupancy was ~ 64% across a broad range of forests, which was at least five times more than expected based on previous surveys using alternative methods. After accounting for imperfect detection, probability of occupancy was influenced by elevation (-ve), cover of important browse trees (+ve), landscape NDVI (+ve) and extent of recent wildfire (-ve, but minor effect). Elevation was the most influential variable, though the relationship was non-linear and low occupancy was most common at tableland elevations (> 1000 m). Neither occupancy nor bellow rate were influenced by timber harvesting intensity, time since harvesting or local landscape extent of harvesting or old growth. Extrapolation of occupancy across modelled habitat indicates that the hinterland forests of north-east NSW support a widespread, though likely low density koala population that is considerably larger than previously estimated. Retention forestry has a significant role to play in mitigating harvesting impacts on biodiversity, including for forest specialists, but localised studies are needed to optimise prescriptions for koalas."
https://openalex.org/W2899395044,"Background The recruitment and retention of patients are significant methodological challenges for trials. Whilst research has focussed on recruitment, the failure to retain recruited patients and collect outcome data can lead to additional problems and potentially biased results. Research to identify effective retention strategies has focussed on influencing patient behaviour through incentives, reminders and alleviating patient burden, but has not sought to improve patient understanding of the importance of retention. Our aim is to assess how withdrawal, retention and the value of outcome data collection is described within the Patient Information Leaflets (PIL) used during consent. Methods Fifty adult or parent PIL from a cohort of trials starting between 2009–2012 and funded by the NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme were obtained from protocols, websites or by contacting trialists. A checklist of PIL content based on Health Research Authority (HRA) and ICH GCP Guidelines was supplemented with retention specific questions. Corresponding protocols were also evaluated to cross reference trial specific procedures with information communicated to patients. Results PIL frequently reiterated the patient’s right to withdraw at any time (n = 49, 98%), without having to give a reason and without penalty (n = 45, 90%). However, few informed patients they may be asked to give a withdrawal reason where willing (n = 6, 12%). Statements about the value of retention were infrequent (n = 8, 16%). Consent documents failed to include key content that might mitigate withdrawals, such as the need for treatment equipoise (n = 3, 6%). Nearly half the trials in the cohort (n = 23, 46%) wanted to continue to collect outcome data if patients withdraw. However, in 70% of PIL using prospective consent, withdrawal was described in generic terms leaving patients unaware of the difference between stopping treatment and all trial involvement. Nineteen (38%) trials offered withdrawing patients the option to delete existing data. Conclusions Withdrawal and retention is poorly described within PIL and addressing this might positively impact levels of patient attrition, reducing missing data. Consent information is unbalanced, focussing on patient’s rights to withdraw without accompanying information that promotes robust consent and sustained participation. With many citing altruistic reasons for participation it is essential that PIL include more information on retention and clarify withdrawal terminology so patients are aware of how they can make a valuable contribution to clinical studies. There is a need to determine how retention can be described to patients to avoid concerns of coercion. Future research is needed to explore whether the absence of information about retention at the time of consent is impacting attrition."
https://openalex.org/W2899020366,"The aim was to objectively identify key performance indicators in professional soccer that influence outfield players’ league status using an artificial neural network. Mean technical performance data were collected from 966 outfield players’ (mean SD; age: 25 ± 4 yr, 1.81 ±) 90-minute performances in the English Football League. ProZone’s MatchViewer system and online databases were used to collect data on 347 indicators assessing the total number, accuracy and consistency of passes, tackles, possessions regained, clearances and shots. Players were assigned to one of three categories based on where they went on to complete most of their match time in the following season: group 0 (n = 209 players) went on to play in a lower soccer league, group 1 (n = 637 players) remained in the Football League Championship, and group 2 (n = 120 players) consisted of players who moved up to the English Premier League. The models created correctly predicted between 61.5% and 78.8% of the players’ league status. The model with the highest average test performance was for group 0 v 2 (U21 international caps, international caps, median tackles, percentage of first time passes unsuccessful upper quartile, maximum dribbles and possessions gained minimum) which correctly predicted 78.8% of the players’ league status with a test error of 8.3%. To date, there has not been a published example of an objective method of predicting career trajectory in soccer. This is a significant development as it highlights the potential for machine learning to be used in the scouting and recruitment process in a professional soccer environment."
https://openalex.org/W2898758156,"Climate change is affecting the growth, phenology, and distribution of species across northeastern United States. In response to these changes, some species have been adversely impacted while others have benefited. One species that has benefited from climate change, historically and in response to experimental treatments, is common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a widely distributed annual weed and a leading cause of hay fever in North America. To better understand how climate change may affect the distribution of common ragweed, we built a maximum entropy (Maxent) predictive model using climate and bioclimatic data and over 700 observations across the eastern U.S. Our model performed well with an AUC score of 0.765 using four uncorrelated variables, including precipitation seasonality, mean diurnal temperature range, August precipitation, and January maximum temperature. After building and testing our model, we then projected potential future common ragweed distribution using a suite of 13 global climate models (GCMs) under two future greenhouse gas scenarios for mid and late-century. In addition to providing georeferenced hot spots of potential future expansion, we also provide a metric of confidence by evaluating the number of GCMs that agree. We show a substantial contraction of common ragweed in central Florida, southern Appalachian Mountains, and northeastern Virginia and areas of potential expansion at the northern margins of its current distribution, notably in northeastern U.S. However, the vast majority of this increase is projected to occur by mid-century and may be moderated somewhat by the 2070s, implying that common ragweed may be sensitive to climatic variability. Although other factors and modeling approaches should be explored, we offer preliminary insight into where common ragweed might be a new concern in the future. Due to the health impacts of ragweed, local weed control boards may be well advised to monitor areas of expansion and potentially increase eradication efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2898812018,"Halal food is that which is permissible or lawful for Muslims to consume. Meat products must abide by a number of requirements in relation to their preparation, condition and content to be considered halal. We conducted a survey in order to assess the knowledge of, and attitudes towards, halal meat products in two contrasting countries, one with a majority non-Muslim population (Australia, respondent n = 565), where the most commonly followed religion is Christianity, and one with a majority Muslim population (Malaysia, n = 740). The most common reasons for avoiding halal food were animal welfare, religion and meat quality. Malaysians generally believed that halal processes led to improved meat quality, whereas Australians did not. The general consensus was in favour of legally controlling animal welfare during slaughter, supported by both Muslims and Christians. Malaysians were more aware of the main tenets of halal slaughter than Australians. However, some non-compulsory, incorrect practices were thought to be required practices by respondents in both countries, but especially in Australia. Muslims were more concerned about humane treatment of animals during halal slaughter. They generally believed that stunning is never allowed and that this view was acceptable, whereas people from other belief systems generally held the view that this was unacceptable. Religion and education were the most common factors associated with attitudes, beliefs and consumer habits concerning halal. Information from this study can help to improve understanding of attitudes to halal and provide insights to policy makers seeking to address animal welfare concerns."
https://openalex.org/W2754877830,"Climate change mitigation is a shared global challenge that involves collective action of a set of individuals with different tendencies to cooperation. However, we lack an understanding of the effect of resource inequality when diverse actors interact together towards a common goal. Here, we report the results of a collective-risk dilemma experiment in which groups of individuals were initially given either equal or unequal endowments. We found that the effort distribution was highly inequitable, with participants with fewer resources contributing significantly more to the public goods than the richer -sometimes twice as much. An unsupervised learning algorithm classified the subjects according to their individual behavior, finding the poorest participants within two ""generous clusters"" and the richest into a ""greedy cluster"". Our results suggest that policies would benefit from educating about fairness and reinforcing climate justice actions addressed to vulnerable people instead of focusing on understanding generic or global climate consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2899298863,"Understanding microhabitat preferences of animals is critical for effective conservation, especially for temperate-zone bats, which receive fitness benefits from selecting optimal roost microhabitats. Artificial roost structures are increasingly being used in conservation efforts for at-risk bat species. To evaluate microhabitat differences in common artificial roost structures and determine if roost selection occurs based on structure type, we installed artificial roosts of three different styles (bat box, rocket box, and bark mimic) in six clusters. We compared size and measured temperature parameters (12 points/roost) while bats were excluded from one cluster. We simultaneously conducted census counts during the active season at five more clusters open to bats for 1–2 years. The rocket box style provided larger entrance area, surface area, and volume versus other roost types. Microclimate varied with roost design. More positions inside the bat box and rocket box stayed within critical temperature limits for bats (0–45°C)—i.e., were usable. The bark-mimic provided less usable space than the rocket box and, often, large proportions of the roost were > 45°C. The rocket box provided the widest temperature availability in a given hour (max range available 7°C) and was more stable than the bark mimic. A maternity colony of Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) selected the rocket box style; four of five available rocket boxes became primary maternity roosts, with 2–210 bats emerging per night. Future work should aim to manipulate roost size, temperature availability, and temperature stability in isolation to identify which features drive roost microhabitat selection by bats. Comparative studies of artificial roosts account for some inherent irregularity in natural systems, allowing us to study the dynamics of roost microhabitats. We recommend season-long monitoring of microhabitat in novel artificial refuges and comparative studies of artificial and natural roosts, and urge managers to consider potential positive and negative effects when substituting artificial roosts for natural habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2899399825,"Human sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 14 (Siglec-14) is a glycan-recognition protein that is expressed on myeloid cells, recognizes bacterial pathogens, and elicits pro-inflammatory responses. Although Siglec-14 is a transmembrane protein, a soluble form of Siglec-14 is also present in human blood. However, the mechanism that generates soluble Siglec-14 and what role this protein form may play remain unknown. Here, investigating the generation and function of soluble Siglec-14, we found that soluble Siglec-14 is derived from an alternatively spliced mRNA that retains intron 5, containing a termination codon and thus preventing the translation of exon 6, which encodes Siglec-14’s transmembrane domain. We also note that the translated segment in intron 5 encodes a unique C-terminal 7-amino acid extension, which allowed the specific antibody-mediated detection of this isoform in human blood. Moreover, soluble Siglec-14 dose-dependently suppressed pro-inflammatory responses of myeloid cells that expressed membrane-bound Siglec-14, likely by interfering with the interaction between membrane-bound Siglec-14 and Toll-like receptor 2 on the cell surface. We also found that intron 5 contains a G-rich segment that assumes an RNA tertiary structure called a G-quadruplex, which may regulate the efficiency of intron 5 splicing.

Recent studies have shown that the soluble form of Siglec-9 is produced by dental pulp stem cells and shows anti-inflammatory effects by regulating the polarization of macrophages (14Ishikawa J.

Thus, soluble Siglecs may also contribute to the fine regulation of immune cell activities. Siglec-14 is expressed on myeloid cells, associates with signal adapter protein DNAX activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12), and transduces immune cell-activating signals through the spleen tyrosine kinase (17Angata T. Hayakawa T. Yamanaka M. Varki A. Nakamura M. Discovery of Siglec-14, a novel sialic acid receptor undergoing concerted evolution with Siglec-5 in primates.FASEB J. 2006; 20 (17012248): 1964-197310.1096/fj.06-5800comCrossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Genes encoding human Siglec-14 and its inhibitory counterpart Siglec-5 (SIGLEC14 and SIGLEC5, respectively) are located in tandem on chromosome 19. Recombination between SIGLEC14 and SIGLEC5 at the high-homology region (5′UTR through exon 3) yields an allele that encodes a SIGLEC14–SIGLEC5 fusion gene (encoding a protein identical to Siglec-5), which does not produce Siglec-14 protein (18Yamanaka M. Kato Y. Angata T. Narimatsu H.

We previously demonstrated that this SIGLEC14-null allele is common (allele frequency >0.05) in all human populations tested, and its frequency is particularly high in East Asia (exceeding 0.5) (18Yamanaka M. Kato Y. Angata T. Narimatsu H.

We have also reported that homozygous SIGLEC14-null patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are less prone to exacerbation (i.e. an acute worsening of disease symptoms, often caused by microbial airway infection) (19Angata T.

In a previous study, we found that the soluble form of Siglec-14 is present in sera from COPD patients who have at least one functional SIGLEC14 allele (19Angata T. Ishii T. Motegi T. Oka R.

Furthermore, soluble Siglec-14 (sSiglec-14) was recently reported to be a potential early plasma biomarker of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (20Förster K. Sass S. Ehrhardt H. Mous D.S. Rottier R.J.

We hypothesized that sSiglec-14 may represent a negative feedback mechanism that regulates myeloid pro-inflammatory responses elicited by the engagement of membrane-bound Siglec-14 (mSiglec-14). For example, activation of myeloid cells is known to up-regulate several proteases that cleave membrane proteins (e.g. a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein (ADAM)10 and ADAM17 (23Edwards D.R. Handsley M.M. Pennington C.J. The ADAM metalloproteinases.Mol. Aspects Med. 2008; 29 (18762209): 258-28910.1016/j.mam.2008.08.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar)) that “shed” these membrane proteins. If mSiglec-14 is proteolytically cleaved, this will uncouple the ligand recognition (extracellular) and signal transduction (intracellular) functions of the protein, possibly terminating the pro-inflammatory signal elicited by mSiglec-14. In addition, the shed extracellular domain of Siglec-14 may influence myeloid cell differentiation, in a similar manner as reported for soluble Siglec-9 (14Ishikawa J. Takahashi N. Matsumoto T.

To test these hypotheses, we investigated the generation mechanism of sSiglec-14, and we explored its potential functions. In this paper, we demonstrate that sSiglec-14 is a product of alternative splicing. The alternative splicing may be influenced by the presence of an RNA G-quadruplex structure in intron 5 of SIGLEC14 pre-mRNA. We also show that sSiglec-14 has anti-inflammatory properties through interference with the cis-interaction between mSiglec-14 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor recognizing bacterial lipoproteins. The possible biological implications of these findings will be discussed. A soluble form of Siglec-14 may be generated by proteolysis of a membrane-bound form of Siglec-14 or by alternative mRNA splicing. To test whether proteolysis explains the generation of sSiglec-14, we first cultured Siglec-14/THP-1 cells that overexpress mSiglec-14 cDNA and tested whether sSiglec-14 is detected in the culture supernatant. By sandwich ELISA using a detection antibody that is specific to the third Ig-like domain of Siglec-14 (clone 40-1 (18Yamanaka M. Kato Y. Angata T. Narimatsu H.

In contrast, the culture supernatant of U937 cells, which express lower levels of mSiglec-14 as compared with Siglec-14/THP-1 (Fig. 1B), contained higher levels of sSiglec-14 (Fig. 1A). These results prompted us to adopt an alternative hypothesis that sSiglec-14 is produced by alternative mRNA splicing, rather than by proteolysis of mSiglec-14. To test this hypothesis, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′RACE) of SIGLEC14 using human bone marrow first-strand cDNA library (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of the obtained cDNA clones revealed that some clones represented a fully spliced form, whereas others retained intron 5 (or both introns 5 and 6). The splice variants containing intron 5 encode sSiglec-14, as intron 5 contains an in-frame stop codon that prevents the translation of exon 6 encoding the transmembrane domain (Fig. 3).Figure 3Sequence of soluble Siglec-14 cDNA and its translation. C-terminal heptapeptide unique to the soluble Siglec-14 synthesized from the alternatively spliced mRNA retaining intron 5 is shown in red. Stop codon in the intron 5-spliced form (encoding membrane-bound Siglec-14) is underlined. G-rich segment in intron 5 is shown in orange and underlined, and perfect inverted repeats flanking exon 5/intron 5 junction are shown in blue and underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We analyzed the relative abundances of splice variants with or without intron 5 by RT-PCR using the same human bone marrow first-strand cDNA library as template and the primers that flank intron 5 and found that the relative abundances of mRNA that was spliced (mSiglec-14) versus unspliced (sSiglec-14) were similar, whereas the former appeared to be somewhat more abundant (Fig. 2B). Quantitative PCR using combinations of primers and probe that specifically identify the mRNA isoforms with or without intron 5 confirmed this observation (Fig. 2C). To demonstrate that the alternative splicing indeed accounts for sSiglec-14, we prepared a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes a C-terminal heptapeptide that is unique to the sSiglec-14 generated by alternative splicing and used it in Western blotting (Fig. 4A). The data verified that the antibody is specific to sSiglec-14 with C-terminal heptapeptide. We used this antibody in sandwich ELISA (Fig. 4B) and found that sSiglec-14 with the C-terminal heptapeptide is indeed present in human serum. The concentration of sSiglec-14 with C-terminal heptapeptide in the human serum sample (a mixture of sera from multiple donors) was calculated to be 8.08 ± 0.35 ng/ml, which is lower than the concentration of total sSiglec-14 quantified by ELISA using the antibody (clone 40-1) that recognizes Siglec-14 regardless of the C-terminal peptide (29.1 ± 1.9 ng/ml). This result implies that sSiglec-14 undergoes gradual proteolysis from the C terminus and becomes undetectable by the polyclonal antibody, or the proteolytic cleavage of mSiglec-14 also contributes to the generation of sSiglec-14 in vivo. The results of the ELISA of U937 cell culture supernatant (sSiglec-14 with heptapeptide: 2.34 ± 0.06 ng/ml; total sSiglec-14: 2.48 ± 0.04 ng/ml) implies that the former mechanism likely contributes to the lower-than-expected concentration of sSiglec-14 with heptapeptide in human sera. We have previously shown that the expression of Siglec-14 on THP-1 cells enhances pro-inflammatory responses elicited by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) (19Angata T. Ishii T. Motegi T. Oka R. Taylor R.E. Soto P.C. Chang Y.C. Secundino I. Gao C.X. Ohtsubo K. Kitazume S. Nizet V. Varki A. Gemma A. Kida K. Taniguchi N.

To test whether sSiglec-14 has a role in the regulation of myeloid cell inflammatory responses, we prepared recombinant N-terminal His6-tagged sSiglec-14, and we stimulated Siglec-14/THP-1 cells with NTHi in the presence or absence of the recombinant sSiglec-14. As shown in Fig. 5A, recombinant sSiglec-14 suppressed IL-8 response in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the production of several other cytokines and chemokines, chosen from genes that are specifically up-regulated in Siglec-14/THP-1 cells by NTHi stimulation (24Angata T. Ishii T. Gao C. Ohtsubo K. Kitazume S. Gemma A. Kida K. Taniguchi N. Association of serum interleukin-27 with the exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Physiol. Rep. 2014; 2 (24994897)e1206910.14814/phy2.12069Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), were also suppressed by recombinant sSiglec-14 (Fig. 6).Figure 6Soluble Siglec-14 inhibits production of various cytokines and chemokines by myeloid cells expressing membrane-bound Siglec-14 upon NTHi stimulation.

Error bars represent standard deviation of technical triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We attempted to identify the structural element of sSiglec-14 that is required for its anti-inflammatory activity by introducing a mutation at the arginine residue that is required for sialic acid recognition (R119A) or by truncating the C-terminal heptapeptide (ΔC). Both variants suppressed IL-8 production to similar extents as the native form (Fig. 5B). This result implies that neither C-terminal heptapeptide nor sialic acid recognition is essential for the anti-inflammatory effect of sSiglec-14. As sSiglec-14 also suppressed the production of some cytokines/chemokines spontaneously produced at low levels in the absence of NTHi (Fig. 6), we hypothesized the following: 1) interaction between mSiglec-14 and a cis-ligand, likely a pattern-recognition receptor, triggers low-level production of cytokines/chemokines by Siglec-14/THP-1 in the absence of microbial stimulation, and 2) sSiglec-14, by interfering with the interaction between mSiglec-14 and the cis-ligand, cancels the enhanced production of cytokines/chemokines. To detect how sSiglec-14 suppresses production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by Siglec-14/THP-1 cells, we sought to identify a protein that interacts with mSiglec-14 by a proximity labeling method (25Chang L. Chen Y.J. Fan C.Y. Tang C.J. Chen Y.H. Low P.Y. Ventura A. Lin C.C. Chen Y.J. Angata T. Identification of Siglec ligands using a proximity labeling method.J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16 (28899088): 3929-394110.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00625Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, biotin labels were introduced into many proteins in an mSiglec-14–dependent manner by proximity labeling, and biotinylated proteins were successfully enriched by streptavidin affinity purification. The proteins obtained by streptavidin affinity purification were analyzed by proteomics using LC-MS2. By applying a few screening criteria, we identified several proteins as cis-ligand candidates of mSiglec-14 (Table S1). One of the cis-ligand candidates of mSiglec-14 was TLR2, a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes NTHi-associated lipoprotein and induces pro-inflammatory responses (26Lugade A.A. Bogner P.N. Murphy T.F. Thanavala Y. The role of TLR2 and bacterial lipoprotein in enhancing airway inflammation and immunity.Front. Immunol. 2011; 2 (22566801): 10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shuto T.

We therefore tested by co-immunoprecipitation whether TLR2 is interacting with mSiglec-14. As shown in Fig. 8A, TLR2 was indeed co-immunoprecipitated with mSiglec-14, verifying their interaction under steady state. We therefore tested whether the cis-interaction between mSiglec-14 and TLR2 explains the enhanced cytokine/chemokine production by Siglec-14/THP-1 cells. For this, we stimulated Siglec-14/THP-1 cells with N-palmitoyl-S-(2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl)cysteinyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (Pam3CSK4), a specific agonist of the TLR1/2 heterodimer. Pam3CSK4 elicited IL-8 production to a similar extent as NTHi, which was suppressed by sSiglec-14 (Fig. 8B). We confirmed that a blocking antibody against TLR2 suppressed the Pam3CSK4-induced production of IL-8 and found that the addition of sSiglec-14 further suppressed IL-8 production to some extent (Fig. 8C; the anti-TLR2 antibody was used at nonsaturating concentration). Taken together, these results support our model that sSiglec-14 blocks production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines by interfering with the cis-interaction between mSiglec-14 and TLR2. To understand why the splice variant retaining intron 5 is relatively abundant, we sought a conserved element in intron 5 of primate SIGLEC14. As shown in Fig. 9A, intron 5 of SIGLEC14 contains a well-conserved guanosine (G)-rich segment, which could form a higher-order structure known as a G-quadruplex (G4) (28Hänsel-Hertsch R.

DNA barcoding evidenced the presence of cryptic diversity in T. palmi and that warrants exhaustive molecular studies. Our present study is on decoding the first complete mitochondrial genome of T. palmi (15,333 bp) through next-generation sequencing (NGS). The T. palmi mt genome contains 37 genes, including 13 Protein coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA (rRNAs), 22 transfer RNA (tRNAs), and two control regions (CRs). The majority strand of T. palmi revealed 78.29% A+T content, and 21.72% G+C content with positive AT skew (0.09) and negative GC skew (-0.06). The ATN initiation codons were observed in 12 PCGs except for cox1 which have unique start codon (TTG). The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis revealed Phe, Leu, Ile, Tyr, Asn, Lys and Met were the most frequently used amino acids in all PCGs. The codon (CGG) which is assigned to Arginine in most insects but absent in T. palmi. The Ka/Ks ratio ranges from 0.078 in cox1 to 0.913 in atp8.

The T. palmi gene order (GO) was compared with ancestral GO and observed an extensive gene arrangement in PCGs, tRNAs and rRNAs. The cox2 gene was separated from the gene block ‘cox2-trnL2’ in T. palmi as compared with the other thrips mt genomes, including ancestor GO. Further, the nad1, trnQ, trnC, trnL1, trnV, trnF, rrnS, and rrnL were inversely transpositioned in T. palmi GO. The gene blocks ‘trnQ-trnS2-trnD’ and ‘trnN-trnE-trnS1-trnL1’ seems to be genus specific. The T. palmi mt genome contained 24 intergenic spacer regions and 12 overlapping regions. The 62 bp of CR2 shows the similarity with CR1 indicating a possible duplication. The occurrence of multiple CRs in thrips mt genomes seems to be a derived trait which needs further investigation. Although, the study depicted extensive gene rearrangements in T. palmi mt genome, but the negative GC skew reflects only strand asymmetry. Both the ML and BI phylogenetic trees revealed the close relationships of Thrips with Scirtothrips as compared to Frankliniella. Thus, more mt genomes of the diverse thrips species are required to understand the in-depth phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2899219745,"Background HIV and pregnancy prevention are dual health priorities for women, and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Drug-eluting fibers offer a dosage form that combines HIV prevention and contraception, but early understanding of end-user perspectives is critical to avoid misalignment between products being developed and preferred product attributes. Methods Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted in South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe, among 55 women who had used vaginal products in previous trials. Participants were given the opportunity to feel a sample of electrospun nanofiber (the fabric), see how it dissolves, and give feedback on shape, size and other attributes. Women were also asked to compare the fabric to vaginal gel and film. Results Three key themes regarding the acceptability of the fabric emerged: 1) look and feel of the product undissolved vs. undissolved, 2) expected effect on sex, and 3) convenience and ease of use. Upon being presented with the fabric, women were initially distrustful, seeing it as undesirable for vaginal insertion. Women generally approved of the product once they saw it dissolve. However, they stressed the importance of the product not interfering with sex by altering the vaginal environment. Women also reacted favorably to the perceived convenience of the fabric, particularly with regards to storage and transport, perceived ease of insertion and use, and dosing regimen. Conclusion Multipurpose prevention technologies, and nanofibers in particular, should be developed with an eye to minimizing impact on sex while maximizing convenience, and presented in such a way as to emphasize non-abrasiveness and ease of dissolution."

Using shotgun proteomics tools, we explored the nuclear proteins of mixed populations of Plasmodium falciparum extracted from infected erythrocytes. We combined GeLC-MS/MS and 2D-LC-MS/MS with a peptide ion exclusion procedure in order to increase the detection of low abundant proteins such as those involved in gene expression. We have identified 446 nuclear proteins covering all expected nuclear protein families involved in gene regulation. All structural ribosomal (40S and 60S) proteins were identified which is consistent with the nuclear localization of ribosomal biogenesis. Proteins involved in the translation machinery were also found suggesting that translational events might occur in the nucleus in P. falciparum as previously hypothesized in eukaryotes. These data were compared to the protein list established by PlasmoDB and submitted to Plasmobase a recently reported Plasmodium annotation website to propose new functional putative annotation of several unknown proteins found in the nuclear extracts."

Breast cancer mortality rate was calculated considering the mortality cases and women population of each municipality, both based on women older than 20 years old. Moran global and local analyses were used to verify the presence of spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression modeling (Spatial Lag-SAR) with the purpose of analyzing the association between socioeconomic indicators, access and mortality rates for breast cancer.Significant positive spatial autocorrelation was found for breast cancer mortality rates (I = 0.5432, p = 0.001). In the spatial regression analysis, the model explained 61% of the variance of the mortality rates for breast cancer. The mortality rate for breast cancer was negatively associated with the illiteracy rate (Coefficient = -0.0279) and positively associated with the access index (Coefficient = 12.9525).The lower illiteracy rate has not been sufficient to reduce the specific mortality rate by breast cancer, and the higher the score of accessibility to cancer services, the higher the specific mortality due to breast cancer. The results show that in the state of Parana, the problem is not related to a lack of education of the patients or the distance walked, but rather with the organization of services. These conclusions have important political implications on the organization and quality of the services provided for the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in the state of Parana."

https://openalex.org/W2949185261,"Drosophila suzukii is a horticultural pest on a global scale which causes both yield and economic losses on a range of soft- and stone-fruit. Tackling this pest is problematic but exploiting behavioral rhythms could increase the impact of control. To do this, a better understanding of behavioral patterns is needed. Within this study we aimed to investigate rhythms in reproductive behavior of wild D. suzukii under natural conditions in the field. Environmental parameters were also recorded to decipher how they influence these rhythms. Assays were then performed on laboratory cultures, housed under artificial conditions mimicking the temperature and light cycles, to see if these patterns were reproducible and rhythmic. We were able to promote field like oviposition patterns within the laboratory using realistic temperature and light cycles regardless of variations in other factors including substrate, humidity, and lighting type. Locomotion activity was also recorded under these mimicked conditions to identify how this behavior interacts with oviposition rhythms. Both our field and laboratory assays show that oviposition behavior is likely under the control of the circadian clock and primarily occurs during the day. However, consistent with prior reports we observed that these patterns become crepuscular when day-time temperature peaks exceeded 30°C. This was also found within locomotion rhythms. With an increased understanding of how these behaviors are influenced by environmental conditions, we highlight the importance of using realistic temperature and light cycles when investigating behavioral patterns. From an increased understanding of D. suzukii behavior we increase our ability to target the pest in the field."

Caffeine intake was discontinued 3 days prior to the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 200-mg doses of caffeine or a placebo. Thirty minutes after administration, cognitive functions were evaluated via the Symbol Digit Coding Test (SDC), the Stroop Test (ST), the Shifting Attention Test (SAT) and the Four Part Continuous Performance Test (FPCPT). After the cognitive function tests were conducted, driving performance was evaluated using a driving simulator. We measured the brake reaction time (BRT) in the Harsh-braking test and the standard deviation of the lateral position (SDLP) in the Road-tracking test.Of 100 randomized subjects, 50 (50%) of 100 in the caffeine group and 50 (50%) of 100 in the placebo group completed the study. Participants in the caffeine group had more correct responses than participants in the placebo group on the SAT (P = 0.03) and made fewer errors (P = 0.02). Participants in the caffeine group exhibited shorter times in the Harsh-braking test than participants in the placebo group (P = 0.048).A single instance of caffeine intake changed some neurocognitive functions and driving performance in healthy volunteers.UMIN000023576."

Interestingly, we noted that various P. aeruginosa isolates of the PA14 family, including highly virulent strains, harbor ExoY variants with a mutation altering the C terminus of this effector. We found that these naturally occurring ExoY variants display drastically reduced enzymatic activity and toxicity. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of the ExoY–F-actin interaction, revealing that the extreme C terminus of ExoY is critical for binding to F-actin in target cells and that some P. aeruginosa isolates carry C-terminally mutated, low-activity ExoY variants.

This study aimed to investigate the association between socioeconomic status and reactions to radiation exposure risk. This cross-sectional study, based on a self-reported online survey was conducted between 3 March and 21 March 2012, one year after the accident at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. We used feelings of anxiety and risk-averse behavior concerning radiation exposure as dependent variables, and equivalent income and educational attainment as independent variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) with adjustment for possible confounders. Among 10 000 participants, 23.0% felt anxious and 12.0% engaged in risk-averse behavior for radiation exposure. Participants with a higher socioeconomic status tended not to feel anxious but undertook risk-averse behavior. Participants in the highest quartile income category did not report feeling anxious but showed prevalent undertaking of risk-averse behavior for radiation exposure compared to the lowest income category (for anxiety, aOR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.93, for risk-averse behavior, aOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.69).

https://openalex.org/W2899359859,"Bacterial communities are frequently found in symbiotic associations with most animal species. The characteristically moist amphibian skin provides a good environment for the growth of some species of bacteria; among these a few can act as a first line defense mechanism against infections. Amphibians in the wild have relatively high exposure to bacteria through environmental transmission and through interactions with different conspecifics, whilst in captivity animals interact with fewer individuals, as well as experiencing a less complex environment through which to obtain their bacterial community. Here we compared the skin microbiota of captive and wild Mantella aurantiaca to investigate whether the captive environment was affecting individuals' skin associated bacteria. This could have survivorship implications if captive animals had a different skin microbial community in comparison to wild counterparts and they were to be used in a reintroduction program. The microbial community were characterized through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing methodology. Analyses showed that captive individuals had significantly lower diversity of bacterial species and lower relative abundant microbiota when compared to wild populations; this could result in captive frogs released back to the wild probably has greater susceptibility to infections due to inadequate skin microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2952887497,"We consider competition between antibiotic producing bacteria, non-producers (or cheaters), and sensitive cells in a two-dimensional lattice model. Previous work has shown that these three cell types can survive in spatial models due to the presence of spatial patterns, whereas coexistence is not possible in a well-mixed system. We extend this to consider the evolution of the antibiotic production rate, assuming that the cost of antibiotic production leads to a reduction in growth rate of the producers. We find that coexistence occurs for an intermediate range of antibiotic production rate. If production rate is too high or too low, only sensitive cells survive. When evolution of production rate is allowed, a mixture of cell types arises in which there is a dominant producer strain that produces sufficient to limit the growth of sensitive cells and which is able to withstand the presence of cheaters in its own species. The mixture includes a range of low-rate producers and non-producers, none of which could survive without the presence of the dominant producer strain. We also consider the case of evolution of antibiotic resistance within the sensitive species. In order for the resistant cells to survive, they must grow faster than both the non-producers and the producers. However, if the resistant cells grow too rapidly, the producing species is eliminated, after which the resistance mutation is no longer useful, and sensitive cells take over the system. We show that there is a range of growth rates of the resistant cells where the two species coexist, and where the production mechanism is maintained as a polymorphism in the producing species and the resistance mechanism is maintained as a polymorphism in the sensitive species."

The incidence of glucose abnormalities or risk factors that may predict the development of abnormal glucose in the pediatric pancreatitis population is not known. We performed a retrospective chart review from 1998–2016 for patients who carry the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP), acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), and chronic pancreatitis (CP). We extracted glucose values, HbA1c%, and data from oral glucose tolerance and mixed meal testing with timing in relation to pancreatic exacerbations. Patient characteristic data such as age, gender, body proportions, family history of pancreatitis, exocrine function and genetic mutations were also assessed. Abnormal glucose was based on definitions put forth by the American Diabetes Society for pre-diabetes and diabetes. Fifty-two patients had AP and met criteria. Of those, 15 (29%) had glucose testing on or after the first attack, 21 (40%) were tested on or after the second attack (in ARP patients) and 16 (31%) were tested after a diagnosis of CP. Of the patients tested for glucose abnormalities, 25% (13/52) had abnormal glucose testing (testing indicating pre-DM or DM as defined by ADA guidelines. A significantly higher proportion of the abnormal glucose testing was seen in patients (85%, 11/13) with a BMI at or greater than the 85th percentile compared to the normal glucose patients (28%, 11/39) (p = 0.0007). A significantly higher proportion of the abnormal glucose patients (77%, 10/13) had SAP during the prior AP episode to testing compared to the 10% (4/39) of the normal glucose patients (p<0.0001). Older age at DM testing was associated with a higher prevalence of abnormal glucose testing (p = 0.04). In our patient population, a higher proportion of glucose abnormalities were after the second episode of pancreatitis, however 62% (8/13) with abnormalities was their first time tested. We identified obesity and having severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) during the prior AP episode to testing could be associated with abnormal glucose. We propose that systematic screening for abnormal glucose after the first episode of acute pancreatitis in order to better establish the timing of diabetes progression."
https://openalex.org/W2899510904,"Microorganisms, including rotifers, are thought to be capable of long distance dispersal. Therefore, they should show little population genetic structure due to high gene flow. Nevertheless, substantial genetic structure has been reported among populations of many taxa. In rotifers, genetic studies have focused on planktonic taxa leaving sessile groups largely unexplored. Here, we used COI gene and ITS region sequences to study genetic structure and delimit cryptic species in two sessile species (Limnias melicerta [32 populations]; L. ceratophylli [21 populations]). Among populations, ITS region sequences were less variable as compared to those of the COI gene (ITS; L. melicerta: 0–3.1% and L. ceratophylli: 0–4.4%; COI; L. melicerta: 0–22.7% and L. ceratophylli: 0–21.7%). Moreover, L. melicerta and L. ceratophylli were not resolved in phylogenetic analyses based on ITS sequences. Thus, we used COI sequences for species delimitation. Bayesian Species Delimitation detected nine putative cryptic species within L. melicerta and four putative cryptic species for L. ceratophylli. The genetic distance in the COI gene was 0–15.4% within cryptic species of L. melicerta and 0.5–0.6% within cryptic species of L. ceratophylli. Among cryptic species, COI genetic distance ranged 8.1–21.9% for L. melicerta and 15.1–21.2% for L. ceratophylli. The correlation between geographic and genetic distance was weak or lacking; thus geographic isolation cannot be considered a strong driver of genetic variation. In addition, geometric morphometric analyses of trophi did not show significant variation among cryptic species. In this study we used a conservative approach for species delimitation, yet we were able to show that species diversity in these sessile rotifers is underestimated."

Eight species of Brachinus beetles -famous for their unique, highly effective, chemical defense-regularly settle together form large diurnal multispecies aggregations in dark, moist areas in riparian habitats in the Sonoran Desert Region. Here, we document these multispecies aggregations and investigate the incidence and dynamics of aggregation behavior. Analysis of species composition of 59 field-collected aggregations revealed that 71% contained more than one species, eight species regularly co-occurred in aggregations, and no two species showed a preference to aggregate with one another. We provide the first phylogenetic analyses of participants in multispecies aggregations, and find that Brachinus species found together in aggregations are not each other's closest relatives but rather are dispersed throughout the phylogeny of the genus. Further, we find no tendency for species to aggregate with close relatives more frequently than distant relatives. Laboratory experiments on B. elongatulus showed that it chose to settle in occupied shelters over empty shelters. Experiments with B. hirsutus and B. elongatulus showed that B. hirsutus prefers to settle under shelters housing heterospecifics over conspecifics. Our findings suggest that these multispecies aggregations do not form by chance, but rather are initiated by a genus-wide aggregation cue associated with the presence of individuals already in a shelter, which is likely to be chemical and potentially tactile in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2899010172,"Growth factor receptor-binding protein 10 (GRB10) is a well-known adaptor protein and a recently identified substrate of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Depletion of GRB10 increases insulin sensitivity and overexpression suppresses PI3K/Akt signaling. Because the major reason for the limited efficacy of PI3K/Akt-targeted therapies in prostate cancer (PCa) is loss of mTOR-regulated feedback suppression, it is therefore important to assess the functional importance and regulation of GRB10 under these conditions. On the basis of these background observations, we explored the status and functional impact of GRB10 in PCa and found maximum expression in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient PCa. In human PCa samples, GRB10 inversely correlated with PTEN and positively correlated with pAKT levels. Knockdown of GRB10 in nontumorigenic PTEN null mouse embryonic fibroblasts and tumorigenic PCa cell lines reduced Akt phosphorylation and selectively activated a panel of receptor tyrosine kinases. Similarly, overexpression of GRB10 in PTEN wild-type PCa cell lines accelerated tumorigenesis and induced Akt phosphorylation. In PTEN wild-type PCa, GRB10 overexpression promoted mediated PTEN interaction and degradation. PI3K (but not mTOR) inhibitors reduced GRB10 expression, suggesting primarily PI3K-driven regulation of GRB10. In summary, our results suggest that GRB10 acts as a major downstream effector of PI3K and has tumor-promoting effects in prostate cancer.—Khan, M.

https://openalex.org/W2899311175,"Mammalian predators encounter unique hunting challenges during the winter as snow increases the cost of locomotion and influences predator-prey interactions. Winter precipitation may also affect predators’ ability to detect and pursue prey. We investigated the effects of snowfall events on grey wolves (Canis lupus) in a boreal forest ecosystem in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We predicted that wolves would respond to snowfall events by reducing their travel speed and the time they spent travelling. Over the course of two winters, we used remote cameras to identify localized snowfall events and estimate snow depth. We used telemetry data from 17 wolves to calculate travel speed and time spent travelling versus resting. Data were categorized by time of day (night versus day) and time since snowfall events, and analyzed using linear and logistic regression mixed-effects models. We found that wolves were less likely to travel on dates of snowfall events than any date prior to or after an event. Wolves also travelled slower during snowfall events, but only when compared to their travel speed 24 hours before. Effects were most pronounced at night, when movements appeared to be consistent with hunting behavior, and activity levels resumed within 24 hours of a snowfall event. Including snow depth as a variable did not improve model fit. Collectively, our findings suggest that wolves’ response is not driven by increased hunting success or by energetic considerations resulting from increased snow depth. Instead, we propose that wolves reduce their activity levels because precipitation dampens hunting success. Snowfall events may impact wolves’ ability to detect prey and changes in prey behavior could also lead to decreased encounter rates. We encourage scientists to further investigate the effects of short-term weather events on movement rates and predator-prey interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2898804510,"Immune priming in insects involves an initial challenge with a non-pathogenic microbe or exposure to a low dose of pathogenic microorganisms, which provides a certain degree of protection against a subsequent pathogenic infection. The protective effect of insect immune priming has been linked to the activation of humoral or cellular features of the innate immune response during the preliminary challenge, and these effects might last long enough to promote the survival of the infected animal. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a superb model to dissect immune priming processes in insects due to the availability of molecular and genetic tools, and the comprehensive understanding of the innate immune response in this organism. Previous investigations have indicated that the D. melanogaster immune system can be primed efficiently. Here we have extended these studies by examining the result of immune priming against two potent entomopathogenic bacteria, Photorhabdus luminescens and P. asymbiotica. We have found that rearing D. melanogaster on diet containing a non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli alone or in combination with Micrococcus luteus upregulates the antibacterial peptide immune response in young adult flies, but it does not prolong fly life span. Also, subsequent intrathoracic injection with P. luminescens or P. asymbiotica triggers the Immune deficiency and Toll signaling pathways in flies previously exposed to a live or heat-killed mix of the non-pathogenic bacteria, but the immune activation fails to promote fly survival against the pathogens. These findings suggest that immune priming in D. melanogaster, and probably in other insects, is determined by the type of microbes involved as well as the mode of microbial exposure, and possibly requires a comprehensive and precise alteration of immune signaling and function to provide efficient protection against pathogenic infection."
https://openalex.org/W2899046398,"The study of animal behavior, especially regarding welfare, needs the development of tools to identify, quantify and compare animal postures with interobserver reliability. While most studies subjectively describe animal postures, or quantify only limited parts of the body, the usage of geometric morphometrics has allowed for the description of horses’ and pigs’ upper body outline and the comparison of postures from different populations thanks to robust statistical analysis. We have attempted here to optimize the geometric morphometrics (GM) method already used in horses by introducing the outline analysis with sliding semilandmarks (SSL), by eliminating the balance movement of the neck and by focusing only on parts of the upper line. For this purpose, photographs of 85 horses from 11 riding schools, known for differing in terms of housing and working conditions, were analyzed with previous and new GM methods and these results were compared with each other. Using SSL and eliminating the neck movement appeared to better discriminate the horse populations than the previous GM method. Study of parts of the dorsum proved efficient too. This new methodology should now be used to examine if posture could be an indicator of horse welfare state, and similar studies should be performed in other species in order to validate the same methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2898790086,"The MHC class II region in humans is highly polymorphic. Each MHC molecule is formed by an α and a β chain, produced by different genes, creating an antigen-binding groove. In the groove there are several pockets into which antigens anchor and fit. The affinity of this fitting determines the recognition specificity of a given peptide. Here, based on our previous results about the association of MHC class II with the WNV disease, we examined the role of the binding pockets of HLA-DPA1, -DQA1 and–DRB1 in the severe form of the disease. In HLA-DQA1, variants in all pockets 1, 6 and 9 were found to be associated with either protection and/or susceptibility to neuroinvasion caused by WNV. Similarly, pockets 7, 9 and 10 in HLA-DRB1 were associated with severe disease. Protein modeling of these molecules revealed structural and functional differences among alleles with opposite roles concerning the development of the disease. Different amino acids in positions α52 and α66 (HLA-DQA1) significantly influenced the peptide binding while DYWLR/EFA combination (HLA-DRB1) was associated with neuronal damage. Further studies could help us understand the selectivity of pocket variants in order to create suitable peptides for an effective response."

Therefore, in this work, we sought to determine whether the human CATSPER1 gene expression is regulated by the SRY transcription factor. To this end, a series of deletions and mutations were introduced in the wild- type CATSPER1 gene promoter to eliminate the SRY sites, and the different constructs were tested for their ability to activate transcription in human embryonic kidney and murine spermatogonial germ cell lines (HEK-293 and GC1-spg, respectively) using luciferase assays. In addition, by using a strategy that combines electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) we investigated whether the CATSPER1 gene expression is regulated by the SRY transcription factor both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that the transcriptional factor SRY specifically binds to different sites in the promoter sequence and has the ability to control CATSPER1 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2899313905,"P-selectin expressed on activated endothelia and platelets supports recruitment of leukocytes expressing P-selectin ligand to sites of inflammation. While monitoring P-selectin ligand expression on activated CD8+ T cells in murine adoptive transfer models, we observed two distinct ligands on responding donor cells, the canonical cell-intrinsic P-selectin ligand PSGL-1 and a second undocumented P-selectin ligand we provisionally named PSL2. PSL2 is unusual among selectin ligands in that it is cell-extrinsic, loaded onto L-selectin expressed by activated T cells but not L-selectin on resting naïve CD8+ T cells. PSL2 display is highest on activated T cells responding in peripheral lymph nodes and low on T cells responding in spleen suggesting that the original source of PSL2 is high endothelial venules, cells known to produce L-selectin ligands. PSL2 is a ligand for both P-selectin and L-selectin and can physically bridge the two selectins. The L-selectin/PSL2 complex can mediate P-selectin-dependent adherence of activated T cells to immobilized P-selectin or to activated platelets, either independently or cooperatively with PSGL-1. PSL2’s capacity to bridge between L-selectin on activated T cells and P-selectin reveals an undocumented and unanticipated activity of cell-extrinsic selectin ligands in mediating selectin-selectin connectivity. The timing and circumstances of PSL2 detection on T cells, together with its capacity to support adherence to P-selectin-bearing substrates, are consistent with P-selectin engagement of both PSGL1 and the L-selectin/PSL2 complex during T cell recruitment. Engagement of PSGL-1 and L-selectin/PSL2 would likely deliver distinct signals known to be relevant in this process."

Video-derived observations demonstrated higher and more accurate estimates of the prevalence of high bat flight activity and feeding events than acoustic sampling methods. Elevated levels of acoustic activity by Hawaiian hoary bats were found to be related primarily to beetle biomass in this study. The approach may have a variety of applications in bat research, including inference about species-resource relationships, habitat quality and the extent to which species intensively use areas for activities such as foraging."

However, activin A stimulates fibrosis of pancreatic stellate cells, whereas conophylline inhibits it, suggesting that this compound may serve as an antifibrotic drug. Here we investigated the effects of conophylline on human foreskin fibroblasts, especially focusing on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. A gene microarray analysis revealed that conophylline remarkably suppressed expression of the gene for hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and of its antisense RNA, whereas the expression of collagen genes was unaffected. Of note, immunostaining experiments revealed that conophylline substantially inhibits incorporation of versican and collagens into the ECM in cells treated with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), which promotes collagen synthesis, but not in cells not treated with TGFβ. Moreover, a protein biosynthesis assay disclosed that conophylline decreases collagen biosynthesis, concomitant with a decrease in total protein biosynthesis, indicating that conophylline-mediated inhibition of fibrosis is not specific to collagen synthesis. Conophylline affected neither TGFβ-induced nuclear translocation of SMAD family member 2/3 (SMAD2/3) nor phosphorylation of SMAD2. However, conophylline substantially inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), suggesting that conophylline inhibits HAS2 expression via TGFβ-mediated activation of the ERK1/2 pathway.

When fibrosis occurs in organs such as the lungs and liver, excessive connective tissue in the stroma obliterates the architecture and interferes with their function, leading to serious diseases.

Conophylline (CNP) is a Vinca alkaloid extracted from leaves of the tropical plant Ervatamia microphylla (4Umezawa K. Ohse T. Yamamoto T. Koyano T. Takahashi Y.

This compound was initially found to mimic the effect of activin A on the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells (5Kojima I. Umezawa K. Conophylline: a novel differentiation inducer for pancreatic β cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38 (16337165): 923-93010.1016/j.biocel.2005.09.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Interestingly, although activin A up-regulates the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and collagens of pancreatic stellate cells toward pancreatic fibrosis (7Saito R. Yamada S. Yamamoto Y.

CNP inhibits progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis by inhibiting fibrosis (8Nakade Y. Sakamoto K. Yamauchi T. Inoue T. Kobayashi Y. Yamamoto T. Ishii N. Ohashi T. Sumida Y. Ito K. Nakao H. Fukuzawa Y. Umezawa K. Yoneda M. Conophylline inhibits non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28594915)e017843610.1371/journal.pone.0178436Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results suggest that CNP may serve as an anti-fibrosis drug. Here we investigated the effects of CNP on the behavior of human foreskin fibroblasts (NB1RGB). Our microarray analysis revealed that CNP remarkably suppressed hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) expression, leading to a decrease in hyaluronan (HA). CNP inhibited collagen biosynthesis by a decrease in total protein synthesis. Further analysis suggested that CNP inhibits the TGFβ-mediated pathway, especially to ERK1/2, but not the Smad2/3 pathway. Initially, we treated growing and confluent NB1RGB fibroblasts with different concentrations of CNP and examined its cytotoxicity (Fig. 1). In a growing phase, CNP at a concentration of 0.1 μg/ml and higher decreased the cell number, which became apparent as early as day 2 after treatment (Fig. 1B). On day 5, the cells treated with 0.1 μg/ml CNP decreased to ∼40% that of nontreated cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, treatment with 0.025 μg/ml CNP in the growing phase showed only 20% inhibition of cell proliferation on day5 (Fig. 1C). When cells were plated at confluence and cultured further, the MTT levels increased slightly, indicating that cells proliferated slightly and piled up. When CNP was added to confluent NB1RGB cells, the cell number decreased at 0.025 μg/ml and higher concentrations, which became apparent as early as day 2 (Fig. 1B). At 0.1 μg/ml CNP, the decrease became obvious on day 5 (Fig. 1C). As observed under a microscope, cells were viable and attached on the dishes. In addition, both a trypan blue exclusion test and alamarBlue® assay showed no clear cytotoxicity (Fig. S3). These results indicate that CNP inhibits cell proliferation without cytotoxicity, at least up to 0.1 μg/ml. Therefore, we treated cells with CNP at 0.025 or 0.1 μg/ml in the following experiments. To detect specific molecules whose expression is affected by CNP treatment, we performed a microarray analysis. When 27,958 genes in total were analyzed, 39 genes were up-regulated more than 5-fold, and 53 genes were down-regulated less than 0.2-fold after 6 h of CNP treatment in the presence or absence of TGFβ (Fig. 2A). Panther classification analysis (PCA) showed that 22% of CNP-suppressed genes encoded proteins related to the heterotrimeric G protein signaling pathway (the Gαq- and Gα0-mediated pathways, e.g. BDKRB1, RASGRP1, SSTR1, and BDKRB2), and 11% of them encode proteins related to the inflammation signaling pathway (e.g. IL6 and NFATC4) (Fig. 2B). In addition, PCA by cellular component showed that CNP down-regulates expression of membrane-related genes, including HAS1 and HAS2 (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, PCA by molecular function showed that CNP down-regulates the expression of genes encoding catalytic activity (23%; e.g. DGK1, HAS1, HAS2, and NOX4), receptor activity (23%; BDKRB1, IL7R, IL21R, and SSTR1), and binding activity (39%; ADAMTS4, CXCL12, and NFATC4) (Fig. 2D). Accordingly, the raw fluorescence intensities of both HAS1 and HAS2, which encode hyaluronan-synthesizing enzymes, significantly decreased after CNP treatment compared with no treatment (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that CNP down-regulates the expression of HAS genes in NB1RGB fibroblasts. To validate the microarray results, we performed qRT-PCR. The levels of HAS2 expression decreased dramatically 3 h after treatment with CNP at either 0.025 or 0.1 μg/ml (Fig. 3A). As HAS2 expression is regulated by its antisense RNA (HAS2 AS), we also examined its expression levels and found that it decreases substantially (Fig. 3B). As CNP was initially found to mimic the effect of activin A, we examined whether activin A inhibits HAS2 expression. Interestingly, activin A showed little effect on HAS2 expression, suggesting specific inhibition by CNP (Fig. 3C). By erythrocyte exclusion assay, a pericellular HA coat was observed in both TGFβ-treated and nontreated cells (Fig. 3D, left panels, arrowheads). CNP treatment at a concentration of 0.025 or 0.1 μg/ml abrogated the pericellular HA coat in both TGFβ-treated and nontreated cells (Fig. 3D, center and right panels). When HA amounts in the cell lysate/ECM and conditioned medium after 3 days of culture were measured using ELISA, significant decreases of HA levels in the conditioned medium and a trend (not statistically significant; p = 0.3, n = 6) of decrease in HA deposition, correlated with CNP concentrations, were observed in both TGFβ-treated and nontreated samples (Fig. 3, E and F). Interestingly, TGFβ slightly increased HA deposition during 3 days of culture (Fig. 3F). Formation of a pericellular HA coat requires HA-binding molecules, including versican, TSG-6, pentraxin-3, and inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (ITI) (9Evanko S.P. Tammi M.I. Tammi R.H. Wight T.N.

As seen by immunofluorescence staining, versican expression was substantially up-regulated by TGFβ treatment. In both treated and nontreated samples, versican was localized along with fibers and did not accumulate in the pericellular coat (Fig. 3G). Although CNP had little effect on versican deposition of cell culture without TGFβ treatment, it substantially inhibited its deposition with TGFβ treatment (Fig. 3, G and H). Our microarray data revealed little effect of CNP on expression of TSG6 and pentraxin-3, although TGFβ substantially up-regulated expression of TSG6 and down-regulated that of pentraxin 3 (Fig. S1). We further mined the transcriptomics data for the effects of CNP on glycolytic pathways genes, including those for production of UDP sugar precursors. No genes related to HA metabolism, except for HAS1 and HAS2, showed more than 3-fold changes of expression (Table S1). Taken together, the decrease in HA secretion in CNP-treated cells is mainly due to a remarkable reduction in HAS expression. As CNP has been reported to inhibit fibrosis of pancreatic tissue (5Kojima I. Umezawa K. Conophylline: a novel differentiation inducer for pancreatic β cells.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38 (16337165): 923-93010.1016/j.biocel.2005.09.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of CNP on collagen secretion and its incorporation into the ECM. As seen by immunofluorescence staining, CNP treatment substantially diminished type I collagen incorporation into the ECM (Fig. 4A, top panels). TGFβ treatment increased collagen incorporation into the ECM. Under this condition, CNP treatment dramatically decreased its incorporation (Fig. 4A, bottom panels). Quantification of the staining intensity confirmed the decreased levels, with statistical significance, of collagen incorporation observed under the microscope (Fig. 4B). We also investigated expression of type III collagen, known to be involved in fibrosis. Immunofluorescence staining displayed essentially the same patterns, with lower staining levels than type I collagen (Fig. 4, C and D). The specificity of immunostaining patterns for collagens was confirmed by immunostaining using nonimmune IgG in place of primary antibodies (Fig. 4E). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that CNP substantially inhibited type I collagen incorporation (Fig. 4F). By SircolTM assay, CNP at both 0.025 and 0.1 μg/ml did not affect collagen levels in the cell lysate and the ECM of cell culture without TGFβ treatment. When co-treated with TGFβ, CNP inhibited them (Fig. 4G). Taken together, these results clearly indicate that CNP suppresses the incorporation of collagens into the ECM, which is more remarkable when cells are treated with TGFβ. Next we labeled fibroblasts with [3H]proline and examined the effects of CNP on biosynthesis of collagens and total proteins. The levels of total protein synthesis decreased by treatment with CNP at concentrations of both 0.025 and 0.1 μg/ml by ∼40%. TGFβ stimulation up-regulated protein biosynthesis by 50%, and under such conditions, CNP treatment inhibited total protein biosynthesis in a manner similar to that of unstimulated cells, i.e. by ∼35% and 50% at 0.025 and 0.1 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 4H, left panel). The ratio of collagen per total protein in nonstimulated cells was ∼2% in both CNP-treated and nontreated cells. That in TGFβ-stimulated cells was ∼6% and was unaffected by CNP treatment (Fig. 4H, right panel). These results suggest that CNP inhibits total protein biosynthesis and that its inhibition is not specific to collagen. We further mined the transcriptomics data for the effects of CNP on collagen gene expression, which confirmed that CNP has no specific effects on collagen expression (Table S2). The fact that CNP inhibited collagen incorporation more strongly when the cells were treated with TGFβ (Fig. 4) suggests that CNP inhibits TGFβ-mediated pathways. TGFβ facilitates differentiation of fibroblasts toward myofibroblasts, which actively synthesize collagens. Therefore, we examined whether CNP affects the TGFβ-mediated pathway and differentiation. When double-stained for total Smad2/3 and αSMA, Smad2/3 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm in all TGFβ-nontreated cells. When treated with TGFβ, Smad2/3 was translocated to the nuclei in all samples regardless of CNP treatment. Without TGFβ treatment, CNP did not affect the number of αSMA-positive cells. When treated with TGFβ, the number of αSMA-positive cells increased at 24 h and decreased with CNP treatment (Fig. 5, A and B). These results indicate that CNP inhibits TGFβ-mediated differentiation of fibroblasts toward myofibroblasts. The results shown in Fig. 5 suggested that CNP has little effect on Smad2/3 signal transduction. When analyzed by Western blotting, TGFβ treatment substantially increased phophoSmad2, and CNP at both 0.025 and 0.1 μg/ml had little effect on phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 6A, first panel and graph), confirming the results of Smad2/3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5A). Next we investigated other signaling pathways mediated by TGFβ. CNP inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at both 0.025 and 0.1 μg/ml. TGFβ treatment substantially inhibited it, and combined treatment with CNP further inhibited phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A, second panel and graph). CNP inhibited phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in a dose-dependent manner. TGFβ substantially inhibited it; however, combined treatment with CNP did not affect it (Fig. 6A, third panel and graph). To investigate whether the RAS–ERK1/2 pathway was suppressed by CNP treatment, we analyzed the microarray data using the GSEA software version 2.2.4 and the Molecular Signatures Database (Broad Institute). The representative GSEA enrichment plot and corresponding heatmap image of the indicated gene set for CNP-treated and untreated cells confirmed suppression of the RAS–ERK1/2 pathway by CNP treatment (Fig. 6B). To examine whether the PI3K/AKT pathway is involved in CNP effects, we analyzed the transcriptomics data and found that CNP slightly inhibits the expression of AKT2 and AKT3 but not AKT1 (Table S3). When the expression of four representative genes downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway was examined, we observed no remarkable changes with CNP treatment (Fig. S2). Western blot analysis demonstrated little effect on the phosphorylation of Akt by CNP (Fig. 6A, fourth panel and graph). In this study, we investigated the effects of CNP, a Vinca alkaloid that mimics activin A function, on fibroblast behavior and formation of the ECM. The interesting features of this study were as follows: CNP dramatically inhibits HAS 1, HAS2, and HAS2 AS expression, resulting in a decrease in HA secretion; CNP inhibits cell proliferation and biosynthesis of collagens at the same ratio with total protein biosynthesis; CNP inhibits versican incorporation into the ECM; CNP inhibits TGFβ-mediated differentiation of fibroblasts toward myofibroblasts; and although CNP does not affect Smad2/3 signaling, it inhibits ERK1/2 activation, which may be responsible for CNP action. Taken together, these findings compellingly indicate inhibitory effects of CNP on ECM formation by fibroblasts. Our microarray analysis revealed marked decreases in HAS1 and HAS2 expression with CNP treatment among ECM-related genes. In addition, HAS2AS was substantially reduced by the treatment, which was validated by qRT-PCR. The measurement of HA in cell lysate and the ECM and an erythrocyte exclusion assay confirmed its decreased levels by CNP treatment. HAS2 transcription is regulated by a variety of signal transduction pathways involving many molecules (12Tammi R.H. Passi A.G. Rilla K. Karousou E. Vigetti D. Makkonen K. Tammi M.I.

Incorporation of HA into the ECM involves HA-binding ECM molecules such as versican. We have shown that TGFβ substantially increases versican expression and that CNP inhibits its incorporation into the ECM without affecting its transcription. Although versican deposition decreased to ∼60% with CNP treatment, the HA amount in the cells/ECM and the conditioned medium decreased only slightly. This is consistent with our previous results showing that mouse embryonic fibroblas"
https://openalex.org/W2953126773,"Objective The objective of this study was to examine public attitudes towards third-party reproduction and the disclosure of conception through third-party reproduction. Methods We conducted the web-based survey for the public attitude towards third-party reproduction in February 2014. Twenty-five hundred people were recruited with equal segregation of age (20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) and gender. We analyzed the association between gender, age, infertility, and ethical view using a questionnaire regarding donor sperm, donor oocyte, donor embryo, gestational surrogacy, and disclosure to offspring. Results Of the respondents, 36.2% approved and 26.6% disapproved of gamete or embryo donation. The frequency of those who approved was lowest in females in the 50–59 year age group, and was significantly higher in males or females with infertility. Secondly, 40.9% approved and 21.8% disapproved of gestational surrogacy. The frequency of those who approved gestational surrogacy was higher in males or females with infertility. Thirdly, 46.3% of respondents agreed and 20.4% disagreed with “offspring have the right to know their origin”. Those who disagreed were primarily in the 50–59 year age group of both genders, and disagreement was significantly higher in the infertility group compared with non-infertility group. Conclusion In this study, public attitudes were affected by gender, age, and experience of infertility. These study findings are important in understanding the attitude towards third-party reproduction and disclosure to the offspring. Respondents having indecisive attitudes were >30%, which might indicate an increased requirement for information and education to enhance the discussion on the ethical consensus on third-party reproduction in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2898794866,"Patients discharged on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represent a complex population and are at higher risk of early readmission. The reasons and predictors of early readmission in this group have not been well characterized. We identified patients in an integrated health care system who underwent PCI between 2009 and 2014 and were readmitted within 30 days within this health care system. Of the 9,357 patients surviving to discharge after the index PCI, 692 were readmitted within 30 days (7.4%). At the time of readmission, 143 had been discharged from the index PCI hospitalization on OACs (96.5% on warfarin) and 549 had not been discharged on OACs, with readmission rates of 12.9% and 6.7%, respectively (p<0.01). The most common reason for readmission among all patients was chest pain syndromes (21.7% on OACs, 34.4% not on OACs). However, bleeding represented the next most frequent cause of readmission among patients on OACs (14.0% on OACs vs 6.0% not on OACs, p<0.01). Among patients on OAC therapy, peripheral arterial disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–2.57, p = 0.02) and nonelective PCI (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.17–3.12, p<0.01) were found to be independent predictors of 30-day readmission. During rehospitalization, compared to patients not on OACs, patients on OACs suffered a higher unadjusted rate of mortality (6.3% vs 1.8%, p<0.01) and a longer length of stay (6.4 ± 7.1 days vs 4.9 ± 6.8 days, p = 0.02). In conclusion, patients discharged on OAC therapy after PCI are commonly readmitted, with bleeding representing a major reason. These readmissions are associated with high mortality and longer lengths of stay. Interventions targeted towards optimizing discharge planning for these complex patients are needed to potentially reduce readmissions."
https://openalex.org/W2899229574,"UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) catalyzes the transfer of glycosyl groups (e.g., glucuronic acid) to exogenous or endogenous chemicals and plays an important role in conjugation reactions. In vertebrates, UGT genes are divided into 5 families: UGT1, UGT2, UGT3, UGT5, and UGT8. Among these UGT enzymes, UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes are known to be important xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes in mammals. However, little is known about UGT1 and UGT2 genes in avian species. In this study, we therefore aimed to classify avian UGT1 and UGT2 genes based on their evolutionary relationships. We also investigated the association between UGT molecular evolution and ecological factors, specifically feeding habits, habitat, and migration. By examining the genomes of 43 avian species with differing ecology, we showed that avian UGT1E genes are divided into 6 groups and UGT2 genes into 3 groups. Correlations between UGT gene count and ecological factors suggested that the number of UGT1E genes is decreasing in carnivorous species. Estimates of selection pressure also support the hypothesis that diet influenced avian UGT1E gene evolution, similar to mammalian UGT1A and UGT2B genes."
https://openalex.org/W2899272015,"The primary aim was to compare physiological and perceptual outcome parameters identified at common gas exchange and blood lactate (BLa) thresholds in Paralympic athletes while upper-body poling. The secondary aim was to compare the fit of the breakpoint models used to identify thresholds in the gas exchange thresholds data versus continuous linear and curvilinear (no-breakpoint) models.Fifteen elite Para ice hockey players performed seven to eight 5-min stages at increasing workload until exhaustion during upper-body poling. Two regression lines were fitted to the oxygen uptake (VO2)-carbon dioxide (VCO2) and minute ventilation (VE)/VO2 data to determine the ventilatory threshold (VT), and to the VCO2-VE and VE/VCO2 data to determine the respiratory compensation threshold (RCT). The first lactate threshold (LT1) was determined by the first rise in BLa (+0.4mmol·L-1 and +1.0mmol·L-1) and a breakpoint in the log-log transformed VO2-BLa data, and the second lactate threshold (LT2) by a fixed rise in BLa above 4mmol·L-1 and by employing the modified Dmax method. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare the outcome parameters within and between the different threshold methods. The fit of the two regression lines (breakpoint model) used to identify thresholds in the gas exchange data was compared to that of a single regression line, an exponential and a 3rd order polynomial curve (no-breakpoint models) by Akaike weights.All outcome parameters identified with the VT (i.e., breakpoints in the VO2-VCO2 or VE/VO2 data) were significantly higher than the ones identified with a fixed rise in BLa (+0.4 or +1.0mmol·L-1) at the LT1 (e.g. BLa: 5.1±2.2 or 4.9±1.8 vs 1.9±0.6 or 2.3±0.5mmol·L-1,p<0.001), but were not significantly different from the log-log transformed VO2-BLa data (4.3±1.6mmol·L-1,p>0.06). The outcome parameters identified with breakpoints in the VCO2-VE data to determine the RCT (e.g. BLa: 5.5±1.4mmol·L-1) were not different from the ones identified with the modified Dmax method at the LT2 (5.5±1.1mmol·L-1) (all p>0.53), but were higher compared to parameters identified with VE/VCO2 method (4.9±1.5mmol·L-1) and a fixed BLa value of 4mmol·L-1 (all p<0.03). Although we were able to determine the VT and RCT via different gas exchange threshold methods with good fit in all 15 participants (mean R2>0.931), the continuous no-breakpoint models had the highest probability (>68%) of being the best models for the VO2-VCO2 and the VCO2-VE data.In Paralympic athletes who exercise in the upper-body poling mode, the outcome parameters identified at the VT and the ones identified with fixed methods at the LT1 showed large differences, demonstrating that these cannot be used interchangeably to estimate the aerobic threshold. In addition, the close location of the VT, RCT and LT2 does not allow us to distinguish the aerobic and anaerobic threshold, indicating the presence of only one threshold in athletes with a disability exercising in an upper-body mode. Furthermore, the better fit of continuous no-breakpoint models indicates no presence of clear breakpoints in the gas exchange data for most participants. This makes us question if breakpoints in the gas exchange data really exist in an upper-body exercise mode in athletes with disabilities."

https://openalex.org/W2899173372,"To describe labor progression patterns with oxytocin for augmentation in women who achieve vaginal delivery; and to determine how long one should wait with effective uterine contraction before labor arrest can be diagnosed.Population-based retrospective cohort study.The final sample involved 8,988 women with singleton gestation, term live birth, vertex presentation, no previous cesarean section, vaginal delivery, and neonatal Apgar score at 5 minutes at 7 or higher, and complete information on oxytocin augmentation in 2005-2007.Linear interpolation was used from the vaginal exam records for each woman to estimate the cervical dilation when oxytocin was started and the highest dose was first reached by parity. We used survival methods to estimate quartiles of the traverse time distributions of cervical dilation.Duration of labor under oxytocin augmentation.When oxytocin was just started, it took a long time to observe cervical dilation. The 50th(95th) centiles of the time interval from 4 to 5 cm, 5 to 6 cm, and 6 to 10 cm dilation were 2.9(8.8) hr, 1.7(5.8) hr, and 2.1(6.0) hr in nulliparas; and 3.1(10.1) hr, 1.9(8.0) hr, and 1.7(6.2) hr in multiparas. After effective uterine contractions were achieved under oxytocin, labor progressed much faster. The corresponding values were 0.7(2.4)hr, 0.5(1.5)hr, and 0.5(1.5)hr in nulliparas; and 0.6(1.9)hr, 0.4(1.1)hr, and 0.4(0.9)hr in multiparas. Low- and high-dose oxytocin regimens had similar effects on labor.When oxytocin is just started for labor augmentation in early first stage, it may take up to 10 hours for the cervix to dilate by 1 cm. Once effective uterine contractions are achieved and the cervix is dilated more than 5 cm, cervical dilation to the next centimeter occurs within 2 hrs in both nulliparas and multiparas in 95% of the cases. High- and low-dose oxytocin had a similar impact on labor progression in augmented labor."
https://openalex.org/W2899174452,"The objective was to describe and validate a new and alternative software procedure for 24-locus mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number-tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) based on the multipurpose BioNumerics software. DNA from randomly selected isolates of Mtb from two European laboratories, including external control samples for MIRU-VNTR typing, were analysed. Samples were genotyped using the commercial 24-locus VNTR typing kit from GenoScreen. The PCR amplified fragments were separated by capillary electrophoresis. For the subsequent analyses, the currently used software GeneMapper was compared with BioNumerics. The endpoint was the level of concordance when comparing genotyping results obtained from BioNumerics with results obtained from GeneMapper and the ECDC proficiency study reference results. Also, the number of necessary manual standard size corrections and allele assignments in the two different software methods were compared. In total, 272 DNA samples, including the ECDC proficiency panel, were analysed. For all samples, there were 100% concordance of results. For a randomly selected set of 96 samples the numbers of manual corrections needed for size standards were 199 with GeneMapper versus zero for BioNumerics. The numbers of manual corrections for allele assignments were 122 with GeneMapper versus 16 with BioNumerics. In conclusion, we have validated the multipurpose software BioNumerics for standard 24-locus MIRU-VNTR typing and the software shows promising benefits in terms of simplification and minimization of hand-on time."
https://openalex.org/W2949799380,"New cytometric techniques continue to push the boundaries of multi-parameter quantitative data acquisition at the single-cell level particularly in immunology and medicine. Sophisticated analysis methods for such ever higher dimensional datasets are rapidly emerging, with advanced data representations and dimensional reduction approaches. However, these are not yet standardized and clinical scientists and cell biologists are not yet experienced in their interpretation. More fundamentally their range of statistical validity is not yet fully established. We therefore propose a new method for the automated and unbiased analysis of high-dimensional single cell datasets that is simple and robust, with the goal of reducing this complex information into a familiar 2D scatter plot representation that is of immediate utility to a range of biomedical and clinical settings. Using publicly available flow cytometry and mass cytometry datasets we demonstrate that this method (termed CytoBinning), recapitulates the results of traditional manual cytometric analyses and leads to new and testable hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2898964852,"Estimates of spatial patterns of broad-scale species richness are central to major questions in ecology, evolution and conservation. Yet, they are scarce due to incomplete information on species distributions. Often the only germane data derives from museum specimens collected during non-standardized sampling. Rarefaction, a promising approach to estimate broad-scale richness with these data, estimates the expected number of species represented in subsets of n specimens drawn from N specimens collected in a sampling unit. One version of rarefaction, known as individual-based rarefaction, assumes that the N specimens collected in a sampling unit constitute a random sample of individuals in that sampling unit. Another version, known as spatially explicit rarefaction, assumes that the N specimens collected in a sampling unit are spatially aggregated. We examined the working hypothesis that, when applied to museum specimen data, spatially explicit rarefaction is less biased than individual-based rarefaction because it reduces overestimation due to spatially aggregated sampling. We derived five predictions from this working hypothesis and tested them using computer simulation experiments based on a database of 129,782 plant specimens from Nicaragua, and sampling units of 5 x 5, 50 x 50, and 100 x 100 km. One experiment was a negative control, whereby we simulated collection of randomly chosen individuals from each sampling unit. In contrast, three other experiments included spatially aggregated sampling. In all experiments we applied individual-based and spatially explicit rarefaction to estimate richness, with n = 200 and n = 500 specimens. As expected, the experiment designed as a negative control did not support the working hypothesis. The other three experiments supported the working hypothesis in analyses of larger sampling units, but not in 5 x 5 km sampling units. The predictions we derived from the working hypothesis can be used to assess which rarefaction version is best in particular systems."
