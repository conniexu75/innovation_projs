https://openalex.org/W2090735953,"Male Mormon crickets produce a large spermatophore that the female eats. Spermatophore proteins are important to female reproduction, and females compete for access to singing males. Males reject most receptive females as mates, and those accepted are more fecund than rejected individuals. This role reversal in courtship is in contrast to the behavior of the sexes in katydid species in which the males produce small spermatophores."

This result supports the view that organic compounds in meteorites were produced by catalytic reactions between carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the solar nebula."

When the first rehearsal occurs, at about 300 days of age, large numbers of syllables are perfected. They are developed through invention and improvisation as well as imitation. Most are discarded at the time of song crystallization. Hence, these songbirds learn more than they manifest in full adult song."
https://openalex.org/W2063720903,"The permeability of plant cell walls to macromolecules may limit the ability of enzymes to alter the biochemical and physical properties of the wall. Proteins of molecular weight up to 60,000 can permeate a substantial portion of the cell wall. Measurements of wall permeability in which cells are exposed to hypertonic solutions of macromolecules may seriously underestimate wall permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2021746632,"The solubility of rhyolitic glass increases with increasing alkalinity, whereas the ratio of silicon to aluminum decreases with increasing alkalinity. The strong correlation observed between alkalinity and zeolite mineralogy in saline, alkaline lakes is thought to be a function of this relationship between pH and the Si/Al ratio. It is suggested that this function is a result of the reaction between silicic glass and alkaline solution whereby (i) a gel forms, whose Si/Al ratio is controlled by the Si/Al ratio of the solution, and (ii) a zeolite forms from the gel, whose Si/Al ratio is, in turn, controlled by the composition of the gel."
https://openalex.org/W2092647584,"Both biologically active and autoclaved sediments convert trimethyltin hydroxide to the volatile tetramethyltin. Larger amounts of tetramethyltin were formed in the bioactive sediments than in the sterile sediments. No volatile tin compounds were detected in the absence of trimethyltin hydroxide or from trimethyltin hydroxide in seawater or in seawater containing bentonite. The formation of tetramethyltin is slow, taking over 80 days at 16Â°C to reach a maximum. The extent of conversion, although significant, is not extensive. The formation of tetramethyltin occurs in estuarine sediments by both abiotic and biologically enhanced pathways. A redistribution mechanism accounts for at least the abiotic pathway and possibly both formation pathways."

The resulting slicks are several hundred meters wide and are of the order of 10(-5) centimeters thick; tarry masses within these slicks frequently wash ashore."
https://openalex.org/W2082612647,"Ingestion of diet containing streptomycin inhibited the conversion of myrcene, a host plant terpene, to the male-specific pheromones ipsenol and ipsdienol in 1ps paraconfusus. Synthesis of cis-verbenol, which is not a sex-specific pheromone, from the host plant terpene (-)-alpha-pinene and other metabolites from these two terpenes was not inhibited by the antibiotic."
https://openalex.org/W1976143005,"Elemental abundances of major (Ti, Al, Fe, and Ca), minor (Na, Mn, and Cr), and trace elements [14 rare-earth elements (REE), Y, In, Cd, Rb, Cs, Ba, Co, and Sc] in lunar anorthosites separated from Apollo 11 sample 10085 coarse fines have been determined by means of instrumental and radiochemical neutron activation analysis. The REE distribution pattern of lunar anorthosites, relative to ordinary chondrites, has a positive Eu anomaly. On the assumption that (i) the lunar composition is similar to that of ordinary chondritic meteorites low in total Fe ( approximately 13 percent); (ii) lunar anorthosites are derived from highland cratering events and are representative of the highlands; and (iii) the moon differentiated into olivine, hypersthene, and basaltic and anorthositic phases, and plagioclase crysstallization began after approximately 93 percent solidification, then mass balance calculations yield approximately 30-kilometer and approximately 10-kilometer thicknesses for the lunar highlands for the melting and chemical differentiation of the entire moon and of the upper 200 kilometers, respectively. Corresponding thicknesses of the basaltic basement rocks were approximately 5 kilometers and approximately 2 kilometers, respectively. Alternatively, if the anorthosites of this study are representative of the highlands and the onset of plagioclase crystallization occurred after approximately 50 percent solidification of the initially melted moon, calculations with REE and Ba partition coefficients suggest that the REE and Ba abundances in the primeval moon were similar to those observed in basaltic achondrites."
https://openalex.org/W2001248285,Populations of the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammica (Brandt) occur in tide pools and surge channels below intertidal mussel beds where they capture mussels dislodged by wave action and by sea star foraging. Dense concentrations of small juvenile anemones occur only within mussel beds and are probably the result of larval settlement or differential survival in that habitat. Areas experimentally cleared of anemones showed that recruitment was primarily by migrating juveniles and that the rate of immigration over a 2-year period was much higher in experimental removal areas near mussel beds than in those further away. Mussel beds thus function as an important juvenile habitat (refuge and nursery); juveniles later migrate downward and are then in a position to capture dislodged mussels and grow to adult size.

https://openalex.org/W2029488351,"Oxidation of sewage ammonium in the Potomac River is described in terms of a simple kinetic model, with growth of nitrifying bacteria limited by the supply of ammonium ion. The oxidation rate varies inversely with freshwater inflow, and the associated demand for oxygen varies as the inverse square of the freshwater inflow rate. Similar behavior is observed for the Delaware River. The model accounts for the observed concentrations of ammonium and nitrous oxide."
