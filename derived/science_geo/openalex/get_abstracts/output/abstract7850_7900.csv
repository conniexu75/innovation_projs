https://openalex.org/W1598617551,"We have studied the crystallization of Bacillus ste- arothermophilus tryptophan tRNA synthetase. Exper- imental conditions used in 35 different crystallization trials were chosen by systematic assignment of varia- bles in accordance with the two principles of randomi- zation and balance, which are characteristic of incom- plete factorial experiments. Polymorphism in the re- sulting precipitated, microcrystalline, or crystalline protein samples was identified and rated numerically on a rough but quantitative scale. Correlations between these estimates of crystal quality and all experimental variables were identified by stepwise multiple regres- sion analysis. Several variables proved to be signifi- cantly correlated with crystal quality. Having established a favorable precipitation proce- dure and ionic composition within broad limits, we next carried out a complete factorial experiment with four factors using two pH values and two temperatures in the presence or absence of two low molecular weight substrates, tryptophan and ATP. These experiments clearly established a favorable pH and produced large (0.5 mm) single crystals with each of the four possible substrate permutations. At least one crystal form, en- zyme plus tryptophan, is suitable for structural studies by x-ray diffraction. The factorial approach appears to be an advantageous alternative to classical controlled single factor and full factorial designs for establishing cause and effect relationships in protein crystallization. Rational exploration of cause and effect relationships gov- erning the crystallization of proteins has traditionally been eschewed, owing to the potentially very large number of controlled experiments required for a systematic study. The essential difficulty is that a number of different experimental conditions, pH, temperature, various mono- and divalent ions, and different organic solutes, may interact in apparently ca- pricious ways to provide a favorable environment in which crystals will eventually grow (an excellent review is Mc- Pherson, 1976a). Despite this seemingly overwhelming difficulty, small quan- tities of protein can be used quite efficiently by using the factorial approach to experimental design (Fisher, 1942). This approach is counter-intuitive: no attempt is made to identify the effects of varying individual factors by controlled experi- ments in which other factors remain constant. Rather, effi- ciency in a factorial experiment arises from two rather differ- * This work was supported by Research Grant GM21991 from the National Institutes of Health and by a fellowship in academic medi- cine from the Jefferson Pilot Corporation (C!.

https://openalex.org/W178378932,"The inactivation of glucocorticoid receptors that occurs when cytosol is heated at 25 degrees C is blocked reversibly by molybdate and slowed by some other phosphatase inhibitors such as fluoride and glucose 1-phosphate. Molybdate is also capable of preventing nonenzymatic inactivation of unbound receptors caused by exposure to salt or precipitation with ammonium sulfate at 0 degrees C. Inactivation of unbound receptors caused by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration is prevented by all three inhibitors. Both molybdate and tungstate block temperature-dependent transformation of glucocorticoid.receptor complexes to the DNA-binding state, where fluoride and glucose 1-phosphate have no effect. Transformation brought about at 0 degrees C by salt, ammonium sulfate precipitation, or gel filtration is also blocked by both molybdate and tungstate. Tungstate differs from molybdate in that it has little or no effect on receptor inactivation. Fluoride and glucose 1-phosphate do not inhibit transformation. These observations support the proposal that molybdate and tungstate are interacting through a reversible association with the glucocorticoid receptor itself. We propose that they may act by forming a complex with a phosphate moiety on the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1599155589,"Human high Mr kininogen was purified from normal plasma in 35% yield. The purified high Mr kininogen appeared homogeneous on polyacrylamide gels in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol and gave a single protein band with an apparent Mr = 110,000. Using sedimentation equilibrium techniques, the observed Mr was 108,000 +/- 2,000. Human plasma kallikrein cleaves high Mr kininogen to liberate kinin and give a kinin-free, two-chain, disulfide-linked molecule containing a heavy chain of apparent Mr = 65,000 and a light chain of apparent Mr = 44,000. The light chain is histidine-rich and exhibits a high affinity for negatively charged materials. The isolated alkylated light chain quantitatively retains the procoagulant activity of the single-chain parent molecule. 125I-Human high Mr kininogen undergoes cleavage in plasma during contact activation initiated by addition of kaolin. This cleavage, which liberates kinin and gives a two-chain, disulfide-linked molecule, is dependent upon the presence of prekallikrein and Factor XII (Hageman factor) in plasma. Addition of purified plasma kallikrein to normal plasma or to plasmas deficient in prekallikrein or Factor XII in the presence or absence of kaolin results in cleavage of high Mr kininogen and kinin formation."
https://openalex.org/W1583481604,"We showed previously that fibril formation in vitro from rat tail tendon collagen requires a temperature-dependent initiation (Step 1) following which linear assembly to form thin filaments (Step 2) proceeds as rapidly at 4 degrees C as at 26 degrees C. Step 3, lateral assembly of filaments to form fibrils, is again temperature-dependent. We now find that Step 1 is complete in 6 min at 26 degrees C and the time is independent of collagen concentration in the range 0.08 to 0.39 mg/ml. Collagen treated with pepsin, which removes the nonhelical ends but leaves the triple helix intact, forms fibrils by a similar mechanism. However, Step 1 is altered or absent and early temperature changes produce a complex response consistent with an alternate, counterproductive pathway. Assembly is also much slower, particularly Step 2, and the fibrils formed are abnormal in that native banding is often absent and short tactoidal forms are common. These results suggest that in the assembly of fibrils from normal collagen the nonhelical ends are involved in an early conformational change and critically regulate later steps."
https://openalex.org/W1546966197,"Myosin light chain kinase, which is located primarily in the soluble fraction of bovine myocardium, has been isolated and purified approximately 1200-fold with 16% yield by a three-step procedure. The approximate content of soluble myosin light chain kinase in heart is calculated to be 0.63 microM. The isolated kinase is active only as a ternary complex consisting of the kinase, calmodulin, and Ca2+; the apparent Kd for calmodulin is 1.3 nM. The enzyme also exhibits a requirement for Mg2+ ions. Myosin light chain kinase is a monomeric enzyme with Mr = 85,000. The enzyme exhibits a Km for ATP of 175 microM, and a K0.5 for the regulatory light chain of cardiac myosin of 21 microM. The optimum pH is 8.1. Kinase activity is specific for the regulatory light chain of myosin. The specific activity of the isolated enzyme (30 nmol 32P/min/mg of protein) is considerably less than and corresponding values reported for the skeletal and smooth muscle light chain kinases. This is probably due to proteolysis during extraction of the myocardium, a phenomenon which has, as yet, proven impossible to eliminate. In contrast to the smooth muscle enzyme (Adelstein, R.S., Conti, M.A., Hathaway, D.R., and Klee, C.B. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 8347-8350), the cardiac kinase is not phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1492106511,"Two isomers of tetrasialogangliosides were isolated and purified to homogeneity from human, bovine, chicken, and cod fish brains by employing DEAE-Sephadex and Iatrobeads column chromatographies. The tetrasialogangliosides of human, bovine, and chicken brains appeared to be identical because they had identical mobilities on thin layer plates developed with six different solvent systems. The tetrasialoganglioside of cod fish brain moved slower on thin layer plates than the tetrasialoganglioside from the other species. The ganglioside preparations were subjected to mild acid hydrolysis, neuraminidase treatment, and periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction. The structures of the two isomers were differentiated from each other by controlled mild acid hydrolysis in both aqueous and organic solvents. The structure IV3(NeuAc)2,II3(NeuAc)2-GgOse4ceramide is assigned to the tetrasialoganglioside of human, bovine, and chicken brains; and the structure IV3NeuAc,II2(NeuAc)3-GgOse4ceramide is assigned to that of cod fish brain. The possible pathways for the synthesis of the two tetrasialogangliosides are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1001283980,"We present a kinetic model of protein synthesis which encompasses initiation, elongation, and termination parameters. We have investigated the dependence of the total rate of protein synthesis and the size of the translating polysomes on each of these parameters and in particular on the level of active 40 S ribosomes and initiation factors. This model qualitatively fits experimental data for the ratio of alpha- to beta-globin synthesis in reticulocytes, both under normal conditions and in the presence of inhibitors of chain initiation. This model has also been used to examine the effect that limiting amounts of certain tRNAs might have on the total rate of protein synthesis. In addition, the role of initiation factor discrimination and mRNA length are examined with respect to the differential translation of mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1522482374,"Abstract Cytochrome P-450scc can be reconstituted into a phospholipid bilayer in the absence of added detergent by incubation of purified hemoprotein with preformed phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Salt effects demonstrate that the primary interaction between the cytochrome and phospholipid vesicles is hydrophobic rather than ionic; in contrast, neither adrenodoxin reductase nor adrenodoxin will bind to phosphatidylcholine vesicles by hydrophobic interactions. Insertion of cytochrome P-450scc into a phospholipid bilayer results in conversion of the optical spectrum to a low spin type, but this transition is markedly diminished if cholesterol is incorporated within the bilayer. Vesicle-reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc metabolizes cholesterol within the bilayer (turnover = 13 nmol/min/nmol of cytochrome P-450scc); virtually all (greater than 94%) of the cholesterol within the vesicle is accessible to the enzyme. Dilution of cholesterol within the bilayer by increasing the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio at a constant amount of cholesterol and cytochrome P-450scc results in a decreased rate of side chain cleavage, and cytochrome P-450scc incorporated into a cholesterol-free vesicle cannot metabolize cholesterol within a separate vesicle. In addition, activity of the reconstituted hemoprotein is sensitive to the fatty acid composition of the phospholipid. These results indicate that the cholesterol binding site on vesicle-reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc is in communication with the hydrophobic bilayer of the membrane. The reducibility of vesicle-reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc as well as spectrophotometric and activity titration experiments show that all of the reconstituted cytochrome P-450scc molecules possess an adrenodoxin binding site which is accessible from the exterior of the vesicle. Activity titrations with adrenodoxin reductase also demonstrate that a ternary or quaternary complex among adrenodoxin reductase, adrenodoxin, and cytochrome P-450scc is not required for catalysis, a finding consistent with our proposed mechanism of steroidogenic electron transport in which adrenodoxin acts as a mobile electron shuttle between adrenodoxin reductase and cytochrome P-450 (Lambeth, J.D., Seybert, D.W., and Kamin, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7255-7264."
https://openalex.org/W1508199610,"Fibronectin is synthesized as a monomeric polypeptide chain. As early as it can be detected inside the cell, it carries carbohydrate side chains. These chains are sensitive to endoglycosidase H, suggesting that they are asparagine linked and high mannose form. The monomeric chains quickly dimerize while still inside the cell. Newly synthesized fibronectin appears as a dimer, both at the cell surface and secreted into the culture medium, about 30 min after commencement of labeling. This exported fibronectin has endoglycosidase H-resistant carbohydrate side chains, indicating processing from the high mannose form to a complex form. Exit of fibronectin to the outside of the cell follows quickly on carbohydrate processing; no large pool of endoglycosidase H-resistant fibronectin exists inside the cell. The dimeric fibronectin at the cell surface is initially deoxycholate soluble but slowly becomes deoxycholate-insoluble and also slowly forms high molecular weight aggregates which require reduction of disulfide bonds for their dissociation."

https://openalex.org/W1577744319,"Cunninghamella elegans oxidized benzo[a]pyrene to several metabolic products. Compounds that were isolated and identified were: trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene, trans-7,8-dihydroxy-7,8-dihydrobenzo[a]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene 1,6-quinone, benzo[a]pyrene 3,6-quinone, 9-hydroxybenz[a]pyrene, and 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene. In addition, an unidentified dihydroxybenzo[a]pyrene metabolite was also formed. Experiments with [14C]benzo[a]pyrene showed that over a 96-h period, 18.4% of the hydrocarbon was converted to metabolic products. Most of the metabolites were sulfate conjugates as demonstrated by the formation of benzo[a]pyrene quinones and phenols after treatment with aryl sulfatase. Glucuronide and sulfate conjugates were also detected as water-soluble metabolites. The results show that benzo[a]pyrene is metabolized by a filamentous fungus in a manner that is remarkably similar to that observed in higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1563522530,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells were isolated from immature female rats after stimulation with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and then maintained in culture. Proteoglycans were labeled using [35S]sulfate, D-[3h]glucosamine, or L-[3H]serine as precursors. 35S-labeled proteoglycans in the medium increased linearly up to 72 h after a 6- to 8-h lag period, and those in a 4 M guanidine HCl extract of the cell layer increased for about 16 h and then reached a plateau and stayed fairly constant up to 72 h. Two distinct sizes of proteoglycans were observed in the medium. The smaller (Kav = 0.60 on Sepharose CL-2B) had lower buoyant densities in dissociative gradients (rho less than 1.4 g/ml). The larger (Kav = 0.26 on Sepharose CL-2B) had high buoyant densities (recovered mainly in the bottom (D1) fraction of the dissociative gradient). More than 90% of the D1 proteoglycans contained dermatan sulfate chains (average Mr = 38,000) which yielded 84% 4-sulfated and 15% disulfated disaccharides after digestion with chondroitinase ABC. About 8% of the 35S-label in D1 was present as a heparan sulfate proteoglycan. When [3H]-glucosamine was used as a precursor, 28% of the 3H activity in the D1 proteoglycans was located in three major oligosaccharide components, two of which were similar or identical with those observed previously in D1 proteoglycans isolated from porcine follicular fluid. These results plus similar susceptibility of the labeled proteoglycans to proteolytic enzymes, especially plasmin, suggest that the granulosa cells synthesize the predominant follicular fluid proteoglycans."

https://openalex.org/W1504679897,"The role of histone H1 in nucleosome heterogeneity and structure has been studied using a reconstitution procedure. Histone H1 and non-histone proteins are removed selectively from enzymatically fragmented chromatin by Dowex 50W-X2 treatment. The resulting stripped chromatin then is reassociated with purified histone H1 using step gradient dialysis. Material reconstituted in this manner was examined by gel electrophoresis, protein cross-linking, and chromatin fingerprinting. The results demonstrate that the histone H1 molecule efficiently binds to nucleosomes with fidelity in an apparent noncooperative manner. Polynucleosomes possess two specific binding sites for histone H1 per histone octamer; the first binding site is of higher affinity than the second. The 160-base pair nuclease digestion barrier and nucleosome electrophoretic class (MIII)n are established upon binding the 1st histone H1 molecule. Upon binding the 2nd histone H1 molecule, polynucleosomes assume a highly compact conformation. The experimental approach introduced here should permit determining whether nucleosomes possess independent specific binding sites for other chromosomal proteins, and should allow reconstitution of the other electrophoretic forms of nucleosomes which we have described previously."

More than one form of epoxide hydratase could be separated from each liver source. Most of the rat and human preparations were apparently homo- geneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electropho- resis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate; all of the preparations examined had apparent M,s of 50,000 as judged by this technique. Different epoxide hydra- tase fractions showed differences upon rechromatog- raphy or agarose gel electrophoresis. Amino acid com- positions were determined for all of the apparently homogeneous enzyme preparations; analysis of the data indicated differences between some of the isolated proteins. Differences were also found between some of the epoxide hydratase fractions when their activities toward the substrates styrene-7,8-oxide, benzo(a)py- rene-4,5-oxide, benzo(a)pyrene-7,8-oxide, benzo(a)- anthracene-5,6-oxide, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene-5,6-0x- ide, 3-methylcholanthrene-11,12-oxide, and f-chloro- ethylene oxide were examined under conditions of fixed time and enzyme and substrate concentrations. Some apparent differences were also observed in the effects of fixed concentrations of metyrapone, cyclohexene ox- ide, and 3,3,3&ichloropropylene oxide on enzymatic activities of the various epoxide hydratase fractions. These observations, coupled with immunological studies presented in the accompanying paper (Guen- gerich, F. P., Wang, P., Mason, P. S., and Mitchell, M. B. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12255-12259), provide evi- dence that 1) rat and human liver microsomal epoxide hydratases are similar to each other in many respects but are distinguishable by several criteria, 2) multiple forms of epoxide hydratase exist in livers of individual rats or humans, and 3) the natures of these forms and the levels of each can be altered by treatment with various xenobiotics. Epoxide hydratase (EC 4.2.1.63) is a microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the formation of trans-dihydrodiols from a variety of epoxides, many of which are known carcinogens (3). Such hydration is usually, although not always (4), associated"
https://openalex.org/W1496034005,"The nonspecific alkaline phosphatase of yeast (Saccharomyces strain 1710) has been purified by ion exchange, hydrophobic, and affinity chromatography. This vacuolar enzyme has a molecular weight of 130,000 and is composed of subunits (probably of 66,000 molecular weight). It also has a small quantity of covalently associated carbohydrate; hydrolysis yielded mannose and glucosamine. The endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase of Streptomyces plicatus released carbohydrate indicating that the latter was attached to protein through an N-acetylglucosaminylasparginyl bond. Synthesis of active alkaline phosphatase by yeast protoplasts is not depressed by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of dolichol-mediated protein glycosylation. Unlike the enzyme normally produced, the alkaline phosphatase which is formed in the presence of the antibiotic does not interact with concanavalin A and, therefore is deficient in or lacking carbohydrate. We infer that there is no regulatory link in yeast between the glycosylation of a protein and its synthesis. The fact that other Asn-GlcNAc-type glycoprotein enzymes of yeast such as acid phosphatase are not produced in their active forms by tunicamycin-treated protoplasts may mean that, as unglycosylated proteins, they cannot be correctly folded or processed. Protoplasts derepressed for phosphatase production contained substantial amounts of a second alkaline phosphatase which differed from the purified enzyme in substrate specificity, sensitivity to calcium, and reactivity with concanavalin A."

https://openalex.org/W1533159545,"8-Azidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-N3GTP) was used in a photoactivatable probe to examine the role of GTP in microtubule assembly. 8-N3GTP was able to substitute for GTP in the promotion of tubulin polymerization and was hydrolyzed at 37 degrees C in the presence or absence of colchicine or calcium. Photolysis of the analog in the presence of microtubular protein resulted in its covalent incorporation onto a GTP-specific site of the beta monomer. The efficiency of this incorporation was different when 8-N3GDP (which does not affect polymerization) was used in place of 8-N3GTP, implying a different orientation of the nucleoside diphosphate within the receptor site. During microtubule assembly, 8-N3GTP was hydrolyzed in situ at the tubulin-GTP exchangeable site in a process that was dependent upon polymerization. The use of [beta, gamma-32P]8-N3GTP and [gamma-32P]8-N3GTP indicated that this hydrolysis occurred concurrently with polymerization and that only nucleoside diphosphate remained bound to the polymerized tubulin."
https://openalex.org/W1498408566,"Partial NH2-terminal sequence analysis has been performed on some products that result from the translation of 26 S mRNA of Sindbis virus either in vivo or in vitro. In vivo products were obtained after pulse-labeling of virus-infected cells. In vitro products were obtained after cell-free translation either in the absence or presence of microsomal membrane vesicles from dog pancreas. The sequence data indicate that the selective translocation across the microsomal membrane required for a distinct portion of one of the integral viral envelope proteins (PE2) is not accompanied by cleavage of its putative signal sequence. Furthermore, the NH2-terminal sequence of a proteolytic derivative (PE'2) that contains the bulk of PE2 and that is generated after exposure of the microsomal vesicles to proteolytic enzymes is identical to that of intact PE2, strongly suggesting that only a COOH-terminal portion of PE2 is excluded from translocation across the microsomal membrane."

https://openalex.org/W7353251,"The cell-free synthesis of hyaluronic acid has been demonstrated in extracts of cultured human fibroblasts. Preparations from fibroblasts of normal individuals as well as those from patients with Marfan syndrome incorporate glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine from their UDP derivatives into hyaluronic acid. Extracts from Marfan fibroblasts demonstrate 3 to 10 times more total and specific hyaluronic acid synthetase activity than do preparations from normal fibroblasts. All synthetic activity was found in particulate fractions with the bulk of activity localized in material sedimenting as large membrane fragments. Marfan and normal preparations exhibited similar properties with respect to substrate, cofactor, pH requirements, and heat stability. Neither the Marfan nor normal enzyme systems could be stimulated by exogenous acceptors, nor did either preparation contain a soluble factor which stimulated or inhibited the enzymic activity of the other. The genetic defect in Marfan syndrome appears to result in increased activity of hyaluronic acid synthetase without demonstrable changes in properties of the particulate enzymes involved."
https://openalex.org/W2201257844,"The activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, an enzyme recently discovered in interferon-treated cells, was found in lymphocytes from normal mouse spleen that had received neither exogenous interferon nor its inducers. The oligoadenylate synthesized by lymphocyte cell extracts inhibited protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. The oligomers were composed mainly of trimer and were resistant to digestion by T2 ribonuclease. The level of the enzyme in lymphocytes was about 20 to 30% of that in L929 cells treated with interferon. The activity of the enzyme was further enhanced in lymphocytes in vitro by addition of interferon. The 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase was distributed among several lymphoid tissues, but was not detected in cell extracts from brain or liver. The enzyme may play an important role in the regulation of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W1486073735,"Studies were initiated to determine whether the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides was coupled to the synthesis of protein. Canine kidney cells were grown with [2-3H]mannose or [3H]leucine in the presence of cycloheximide or puromycin and the effect of these inhibitors on the synthesis of proteins and lipid-linked oligosaccharides was measured. In all cases, the inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a substantial inhibition in the incorporation of mannose into the lipid-linked oligosaccharides, although the synthesis of mannosyl-phosphoryl-dolichol was only slightly inhibited. Cycloheximide had no effect on the in vitro incorporation of mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides when GDP-[14C]mannose was incubated with aorta microsomal preparations. The inhibition of lipid-linked oligosaccharides was apparently not due to a decrease in the amount of glycosyltransferases as a result of protein degradation in the absence of protein synthesis, nor was it the result of a more rapid degradation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides. The inhibition also did not appear to be due to limitations in the available dolichyl-phosphate. The results suggest that the formation of lipid-linked oligosaccharides may be regulated by end product inhibition."

(1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 5381-5385). We now show that the purified protein also stimulates microsomal squalene-2,3-oxide leads to lanosterol cyclase but has no effect on the subsequent conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol. Phospholipid, specifically phosphatidylglycerol or phosphatidylethanolamine, is required for maximal stimulation of the cyclase by purified SPF. The response of microsomal squalene epoxide-lanosterol cyclase to SPF was abolished by pretreatment of the membranes with phospholipase A2 or by low concentrations of deoxycholate, indicating that an intact membrane system is required. Digestion of intact microsomes with trypsin had no effect on the SPF-stimulated cyclase activity. However, in the presence of 0.4% deoxycholate, trypsin completely inhibited microsomal squalene epoxide-lanosterol cyclase. We conclude that the cyclase is located on the luminal side of the microsomal membrane. SPF also significantly enhances the formation of lanosterol from squalene-2,3-oxide already bound to microsomes. This finding is constant with the proposal that SPF influences intramembrane events."

https://openalex.org/W1573687968,"Cleavage of the collagen B chain with cyanogen bromide yields nine peptides which have been isolated and characterized with regard to molecular weight and amino acid composition. The peptides are recovered in equimolar quantities and account for the full amino acid complement of the chain as isolated following limited pepsin digestion of human placental tissue. These data thus confirm the unique composition of the chain and further indicate that the chain has been isolated in essentially pure form. The total number of amino acid residues (1018) observed in the cyanogen bromide peptides of the B chain indicate that it is comparable in length to the previously characterized collagen alpha chains. Thus, the apparent larger size of the B chain noted in previous studies may possibly be attributed to the relatively large quantities of hydroxylysine-linked carbohydrate, but more likely to the increased numbers of large hydrophobic amino acids in the B chain. Although the cyanogen bromide peptide pattern obtained in studies on the B chain serves to differentiate this chain from other known chains, some possible homologies between the B chain peptides and peptides derived from the alpha chains of type I, II, and III collagens are noted."

The protease activity was recovered exclusively from infected cell nuclei and was insoluble, sedimenting with the membrane fraction. Endogenous activity could be demonstrated in young virions which contain precursor PVII molecules. This protease activity only became sensitive to L-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone- or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-mediated inhibition after disruption of the virus particles by sonication, suggesting that the enzyme was internally located. The putative precursors to virus particles, referred to as top components, which do not contain a full complement of viral DNA, did not contain protease activity. The protease released from sonicated virions converted exogenous PVII substrate molecules to polypeptide VII. The noninfectious H2ts1 virus particles synthesized at the nonpermissive temperature phenotypically resemble young virions, but unlike their wild type counterparts, were devoid of protease activity. The results show that the protease enters the precursor particles concurrently with the viral chromosome and that its presence is a prerequisite for the processing and subsequent maturation of infectious adenovirions."

These cells contained very high levels of glycogen (about half the defatted dry weight) and carried out high rates of lipogenesis (up to 800 micron at tritium incorporation from 3HOH/g (defatted dry weight)/h), even in the absence of added substrates. Pentose cycle flux was estimated by a method involving the use of [1-14C]galactose (Rognstad, R. (1976) Int. J. Biochem. 7, 221-228). In hepatocytes from normal fasted refed rats, the amount of NADPH produced by the pentose cycle was sufficient for about one-half to three-fourths of that required for fatty acid synthesis. 2,4-Dihydroxybutyrate, a malic enzyme inhibitor (Schimerlik, M.I. & Cleland, W.W. (1977) Biochemistry 16, 565-570) markedly depressed the randomization of 14C in lactate from [6-14C]hexoses, indicating an inhibition of the pyruvate cycle. 2,4-Dihydroxybutyrate (10 mM) had only a slight inhibitory effect on overall lipogenesis, but increased the rate of the pentose cycle by 40 to 90%."
https://openalex.org/W1580446964,"Abstract A disulfide-interchange enzyme from rat liver microsomes was found to promote binding in vitro of human free secretory component (SC) to dimeric serum-type IgA containing J chain, as assessed by immune precipitation and gel filtration. This effect was greater withe native than with partially reduced SC. Most of the bound SC was covalently linked, as determined by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels in detergent. The enzyme did not promote binding of native or partially reduce SC to IgG, IgA monomer, IgA dimer without J chain, or IgM. In the case of IgM, the enzyme did, however, promote covalent bonding of previously non-covalently linked SC. The results overall suggest that a disulfide-interchange enzyme could play a role in vivo in the cell-associated assembly of secretory IgA by promoting the covalent attachment of SC to a dimer of serum-type IgA and that the J chain in the IgA dimer contributes to the enzyme effect."
https://openalex.org/W1564916688,"A stable apoprotein has been prepared from a soluble purified bovine thyroid iodotyrosine deiodinase, previously shown to be an FMN-containing flavoprotein requiring dithionite for enzymatic activities. The apoprotein binds FMN (Ka = 1.47 x 10(8) M-1) with an almost complete restoration of enzymatic activity. It can also bind FAD (Ka = 0.58 x 10(8) M-1) with partial restoration of activity, but does not bind riboflavin. Photoreduction of the holoenzyme in presence of excess of its free cofactor, FMN, supported enzyme activity at a level of 50% of that obtained with dithionite; substituting FAD or riboflavin for FMN produced, respectively, 20 and 11% of the dithionite-supported activity. The oxidation-reduction potential (E1) of the couple semiquinone/fully reduced enzyme is -0.412 V at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. The value (E2) for the oxidized/semiquinone couple is -0.190 V at pH 7 and 25 degrees C. Potentiometric titrations with sodium hydrosulfite suggests that the enzyme is reduced in two successive 1-electron oxidation-reduction steps. Effects of pH on E1 suggest ionization of the protonated flavin with an ionization constant of 5.7 x 10(-7). The highly negative oxidation-reduction potential for the fully reduced enzyme species and the apparent requirement for full reduction for enzymatic activity suggests that in NADPH-mediated microsomal deiodination an NADPH-linked electron carrier of suitably negative midpoint potential is a probable intermediate."

https://openalex.org/W870812414,"A sensitive immunoassay for the adenosine deaminase binding protein (complexing protein) of human kidney has been developed. Impetus for the development of the assay was provided by the observations that (a) antibody to complexing protein does not react with the catalytically active adenosine deaminase monomer, and (b) binding of antibody to complexing protein does not affect the binding or catalytic activity of the enzyme monomer. Preformed immune precipitate prepared from rabbit anti-kidney complexing protein serum and goat anti-rabbit gamma-globulin serum is used to selectively insolubilize complexing protein. Quantitation is accomplished by measuring the intrinsic adenosine deaminating activity or adenosine deaminase binding capacity of the protein held in the immune precipitate. As little as 1 ng of kidney complexing protein can be accurately quantitated with the assay. The assay was used to demonstrate that complexing proteins from liver, lung, spleen, fibroblasts, plasma, and urine react with antibody to kidney complexing protein. The shared capacity to bind adenosine deaminase coupled with their antigenic similarity suggests that the complexing proteins of a number of human tissues and body fluids may be products of the same gene."

https://openalex.org/W1667642762,"The reaction of choline acetyltransferase with methoxycarbonyl alkyl disulfides leads to a progressive loss in enzyme activity as the size of the alkyl group increases from methyl to n-butyl. Reaction with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) or methoxycarbonyl coenzyme A (CoA) disulfide, leads to a total loss of enzyme activity. DTNB inactivation is biphasic (k1 = approximately 9 x 10(2) M-1 s-1, k2 = approximately 6 x 10(1) M-1 s-1) with the slow phase being diminished by acetyl-CoA. Methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide inactivation is also biphasic (k1 = approximately 2.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1, k2 = approximately 6 x 10(1) M-1 s-1), with the rapid phase being diminished in the presence of acetyl-CoA. Inactivation by methoxycarbonyl methyl disulfide, ethyl disulfide, or hydroxyethyl disulfide, or by methyl methanethiosulfonate is not biphasic. Pretreatment of the enzyme with methyl methanethiosulfonate, which leads to a 25% loss in enzyme activity, abolishes the fast phase of DTNB inactivation, the slow phase of methoxycarbonyl-CoA disulfide inactivation, and any further inactivation by methoxycarbonyl ethyl disulfide. These results are interpreted to suggest that choline acetyltransferase contains two classes of reactive sulfhydryl groups, neither of which are required for enzyme activity."

Rat fecal suspensions were incubated with the taurine conjugate of THCA for 5 and 60% of the free THCA was recovered. When bile from Alligator mississippiensis, which contains mostly the taurine conjugate of THCA, was analyzed by this method, THCA was obtained with the 25R configuration."

https://openalex.org/W108684768,Conditions were established to separate proteoglycan aggregate (AH1) from a bovine nasal septum extract by associative rate zonal sedimentation on a NaCl gradient. The AH1 has a higher protein content than the mixed aggregate-monomer (A1) isolated by conventional associative CsCl density gradient centrifugation from a portion of the same extract. The same associative rate zonal conditions separated the A1 fraction into aggregated AH1 containing hyaluronic acid and nonaggregated proteoglycan monomer (N1) essentially free of hyaluronic acid. The AH1 fraction is richer in protein and keratin sulfate than is N1. Dissociative rate zonal sedimentation of A1 under conditions which totally sedimented most of the disaggregated monomer (AH1-D1) and the nonaggregated monomer N1 separated a less sedimentable protein and keratan sulfate-rich proteoglycan monomer (AH1-D2). Chromatography on Sepharose 2B under dissociative conditions demonstrated that the nonaggregated N1 monomer is intermediate in size between the disaggregated monomers AH1-D1 and AH1-D2. N1 has a buoyant density higher than AH1 and is practically equivalent to AH1-D1. All are dense fractions so that separation by CsCl density gradient equilibration is not feasible.
https://openalex.org/W1500580196,"The isolation and reconstitution of two electron transfer components of tryptophan side chain oxidase from Pseudomonas (ATCC 29574) are described. The dehydrogenase component abstracts electrons from the substrate and transfers them to oxidation-reduction dyes such as potassium ferricyanide and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol but not to molecular oxygen. It is composed of a single polypeptide chain with a molecular weight of 72,000 and exhibits the absorption spectrum of a reduced b-type cytochrome with maxima at 563, 532, 433, 323, and 278 nm. The oxidase component transfers electrons, derived from the former component, to oxygen, and has a molecular weight of 48,000. The absorption spectrum exhibits broad peaks at 680, 438, and 358 nm, and a peak at 280 nm. On sucrose gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, these two components are shown to form a molecular complex, which has the reconstituted oxidase activity. The turnover number of the reconstituted enzyme is comparable to that of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1519378956,"Hyaluronate oligomers were treated with anhydrous hydrazine in the presence of hydrazine sulfate to remove the N-acetyl groups. Complete deacetylation could not be achieved without extensive degradation of the oligosaccharide chain. Partially deacetylated oligomers exhibited decreased inhibition of cartilage proteoglycan-hyaluronate interaction as compared to the unreacted starting material; re-N-acetylation by reaction with acetic anhydride restored the inhibitory activity to a great extent. When the hydrazine-treated oligosaccharides were reacted with other acyl anhydrides, the inhibitory potency was restored to an extent which was inversely related to the size of the acyl group. Thus, for maximal interaction between hyaluronate and proteoglycan, the glucosamine residue of hyaluronate must be N-acylated with a minimally sized acyl group."
