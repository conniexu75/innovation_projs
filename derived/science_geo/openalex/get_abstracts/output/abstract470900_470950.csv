https://openalex.org/W2135403800,"Using the ImmunoChip custom genotyping array, we analyzed 14,498 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 24,091 healthy controls for 161,311 autosomal variants and identified 135 potentially associated regions (P < 1.0 × 10−4). In a replication phase, we combined these data with previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from an independent 14,802 subjects with multiple sclerosis and 26,703 healthy controls. In these 80,094 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 48 new susceptibility variants (P < 5.0 × 10−8), 3 of which we found after conditioning on previously identified variants. Thus, there are now 110 established multiple sclerosis risk variants at 103 discrete loci outside of the major histocompatibility complex. With high-resolution Bayesian fine mapping, we identified five regions where one variant accounted for more than 50% of the posterior probability of association. This study enhances the catalog of multiple sclerosis risk variants and illustrates the value of fine mapping in the resolution of GWAS signals."

The molecular basis for this clinical heterogeneity remains incompletely understood. Here we characterize a long noncoding RNA termed SChLAP1 (second chromosome locus associated with prostate-1; also called LINC00913) that is overexpressed in a subset of prostate cancers. SChLAP1 levels independently predict poor outcomes, including metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality. In vitro and in vivo gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments indicate that SChLAP1 is critical for cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Mechanistically, SChLAP1 antagonizes the genome-wide localization and regulatory functions of the SWI/SNF chromatin-modifying complex. These results suggest that SChLAP1 contributes to the development of lethal cancer at least in part by antagonizing the tumor-suppressive functions of the SWI/SNF complex."

The hallmark of proliferating populations is progression through the cell cycle, which is driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Here, we introduce a live-cell sensor for CDK2 activity and unexpectedly found that proliferating cells bifurcate into two populations as they exit mitosis. Many cells immediately commit to the next cell cycle by building up CDK2 activity from an intermediate level, while other cells lack CDK2 activity and enter a transient state of quiescence. This bifurcation is directly controlled by the CDK inhibitor p21 and is regulated by mitogens during a restriction window at the end of the previous cell cycle. Thus, cells decide at the end of mitosis to either start the next cell cycle by immediately building up CDK2 activity or to enter a transient G0-like state by suppressing CDK2 activity.

Thus, cells decide at the end of mitosis to either start the next cell cycle by immediately building up CDK2 activity or to enter a transient G0-like state by suppressing CDK2 activity. Metazoans tightly control the number of cells in each tissue during development and throughout adult life. Imbalances between the creation and removal of cells lead to excessive tissue growth or failure of tissue function. Much of this feat of balanced tissue homeostasis is achieved by switching cells between two different states: proliferative and quiescent. The transitions between proliferation and quiescence are often reversible—cells must be able to switch from a proliferative to a quiescent state (also termed G0) and later re-engage the proliferation machinery from the quiescent state. A better understanding of these transitions is not only important to understand normal development and adult physiology but also to identify better therapeutic approaches for diseases that involve excessive proliferation, such as cancer, or net cell loss, such as aging and neurodegeneration. Although reduced levels of mitogens, contact inhibition, and various stress conditions are known to promote quiescence, and many molecular regulators of proliferation have been identified, the detailed mechanisms that control the transitions between these two states are still poorly understood. In one prominent model, cells are thought to commit to the cell cycle at a “restriction point” in late G1 (Pardee, 1974Pardee A.B. A restriction point for control of normal animal cell proliferation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). This model was based on experiments in which mitogen-starved cells were restimulated for varying amounts of time to identify a point when the presence of mitogens is no longer necessary to complete the cell cycle. Cells that have crossed the restriction point prior to mitogen removal are committed to completing the cell cycle, whereas cells that have not crossed the restriction point at the time of mitogen withdrawal remain in G0 or G1. Much is known about the molecular events associated with emergence from a mitogen-starved state. In mitogen-starved cells, CDK activity is off, and the CDK substrate retinoblastoma protein (Rb) is hypophosphorylated, resulting in an inhibition of E2F transcriptional activators. Re-exposure of cells to mitogens triggers CDK4/6-dependent phosphorylation of Rb, which initiates the reactivation of E2F. Active E2F induces expression of cyclin E and other proteins that promote CDK2 activity, leading to further phosphorylation of Rb (Massagué, 2004Massagué J. G1 cell-cycle control and cancer.Nature. 2004; 432: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, Trimarchi and Lees, 2002Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Sibling rivalry in the E2F family.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). This reinforced expression of cell-cycle regulators is thought to engage in G1 a few hours before DNA replication, causing an upregulation of CDK2 activity, full phosphorylation of Rb, and passage through the restriction point (Dou et al., 1993Dou Q.P.

What is the restriction point?.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination and degradation of the CDK inhibitor, p21, is also thought to promote the G1/S transition (Abbas and Dutta, 2009Abbas T. Dutta A. p21 in cancer: intricate networks and multiple activities.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Despite a significant amount of knowledge about the biochemical processes associated with emergence from quiescence, much less is known about cell-cycle commitment in proliferating cells. Because cycling cell populations are asynchronous, biochemical analysis of commitment mechanisms cannot readily be performed. Chemical and other synchronization methods can be used to obtain more homogeneous populations, but these procedures can trigger stress responses and may alter the natural behavior of cells. In addition, bulk analysis may mask the existence of distinct sub-states in a population. Even if single-cell methods are used, the lack of accepted molecular markers that distinguish precommitment from postcommitment cells or G0 from G1 cells still leaves challenging problems. For example, there has been a long-standing debate over where between mitosis and S phase G0 ought to be placed (Coller, 2007Coller H.A. What’s taking so long? S-phase entry from quiescence versus proliferation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 667-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A). Here, we introduce a fluorescent sensor to monitor CDK2 activity in single cycling cells. Using time-lapse microscopy and customized cell tracking, we monitored CDK2 activity over several cell cycles in an immortalized but nontransformed human mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A. We confirmed our results in primary human foreskin fibroblasts and in a previously used model for cell-cycle progression, murine Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. By studying unperturbed, asynchronous cultures, we discovered a bifurcation point at mitotic exit where cells choose between two different fates. Many cells exit mitosis with an intermediate level of CDK2 activity, from which they continue to build up CDK2 activity and complete the next cell cycle. The remaining cells enter a transient state of quiescence characterized by low CDK2 activity. We show that cells integrate mitogenic signals during a “restriction window” at the end of the previous cell cycle to decide which of the two paths to take upon completion of mitosis. Finally, using immunofluorescence, genetics, and chemical biology approaches, we show that the bifurcation in cell fate is directly controlled by the CDK inhibitor, p21. We adapted a previously described sensor for the G1/S transition (Hahn et al., 2009Hahn A.T. Jones J.T. Meyer T. Quantitative analysis of cell cycle phase durations and PC12 differentiation using fluorescent biosensors.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) to quantitatively measure changes in CDK activity. The sensor includes amino acids 994–1087 of human DNA helicase B fused to the yellow fluorescent protein mVenus (DHB-Ven; Figure 1B), and contains four CDK consensus phosphorylation sites, a nuclear localization signal, and a nuclear export signal (Gu et al., 2004Gu J. Xia X. Yan P. Liu H. Podust V.N. Reynolds A.B. Fanning E. Cell cycle-dependent regulation of a human DNA helicase that localizes in DNA damage foci.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3320-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We established an MCF10A line stably expressing this construct and found that DHB-Ven localizes to the nucleus in newly born cells. The sensor then translocates progressively out of the nucleus as the cell cycle proceeds and exhibits cytosolic localization at the end of G2 (Figure 1C). We used the cytoplasmic to nuclear ratio (Cyt/Nuc) of DHB-Ven fluorescence intensity as a potential readout for CDK activity. To measure this ratio, we compared the nuclear DHB-Ven signal to the intensity of a region outside, but adjacent to, each nucleus (Figure 1D). An in vitro kinase activity screen using a panel of CDK/cyclin pairs and amino acids 994–1087 of DHB revealed that DHB is phosphorylated strongly by CDK2/cyclin A, more weakly by CDK2/cyclin E, and is not phosphorylated by CDK1/cyclin B, CDK4/cyclin D, or CDK6/cyclin D (Figure 1E). Using small molecule inhibitors in vivo, we showed that the cytoplasmic localization of DHB-Ven was reversed by addition of a CDK1/2 inhibitor (Figures 1F and 1G) but was not altered by treating cells with selective inhibitors targeting CDK4/6, EGFR, MEK, p38, Akt, or PI3K across a wide range of doses (Figures 1H and S1 available online). The localization of DHB-Ven was also unaffected by addition of a CDK1-selective inhibitor (Figure 1H), arguing that the sensor responds primarily to CDK2 activity, at least in cells where CDK2 is present. Treatment of cells with the CDK1/2 inhibitor caused retro-translocation of DHB-Ven from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with a half-life of 7 min (Figures 1F and 1G), showing that DHB-Ven responds rapidly to changes in CDK2 activity. Furthermore, the rate of translocation of DHB-Ven did not significantly depend on when during interphase we added the CDK1/2 inhibitor (Figure S1), arguing that the phosphatase activity acting on the sensor is relatively constant during interphase. We then compared the sensitivity of the response of DHB-Ven to that of two established CDK2 substrates (Cdc6 and Rb) using titration of the CDK1/2 inhibitor (Figure 1I). We found that the three substrates had very different EC50 values, with DHB-Ven being 3.5-fold and 23-fold more sensitive to the inhibitor than Cdc6 and Rb, respectively. Thus, Rb is a highly sensitive CDK2 substrate, meaning it takes very little CDK2 activity to phosphorylate Rb, whereas DHB-Ven required a higher level of CDK2 activity to become phosphorylated. When we examined the phosphorylation status of Rb and the localization of DHB-Ven as a function of DNA content in single cells, we found that cells can have hyperphosphorylated Rb already in G1 when they still have a 2N DNA content (Figure 1J). In contrast, DHB-Ven was only partially phosphorylated when cells have a 2N DNA content (Figure 1K). The phosphorylation and consequent cytoplasmic translocation of DHB-Ven then gradually increased as cells progressed through the cell cycle and the DNA content increased from 2N to 4N. This implies that CDK2 activity progressively increases throughout interphase, and that the DHB-Ven sensor has a dynamic range well-suited to monitor changes in CDK2 activity throughout the cell cycle. To further validate our sensor, we compared single-cell time-lapse measurements of DHB-Ven to earlier bulk experiments in which cells were synchronized by mitogen starvation, restimulated with mitogens, and then lysed for biochemical analysis after varying amounts of time. These earlier studies described an increase in CDK2 activity in late G1 followed by entry into S phase (Dulić et al., 1992Dulić V. Lees E. Reed S.I.

Because adherent cells migrate over time, we developed a custom script to track cells and monitor CDK2 activity in thousands of individual cells through several cell cycles (Figure 2B; Extended Experimental Procedures) and made use of a 96-well plate format to test different conditions in the same experiment. In addition to the CDK2 sensor, we monitored the time of entry into S phase in single cells using SCFSkp2-mediated degradation of a fluorescently tagged fragment of Cdt1 (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008Sakaue-Sawano A.

When we tracked CDK2 activity in individual cells emerging from mitogen starvation, we observed a period of roughly 8 hr of low CDK2 activity, followed by a broad time window during which individual cells triggered a buildup in CDK2 activity (Figure 2D; Movie S1). These dynamics of CDK2 activity are consistent with results from earlier biochemical experiments. Once the increase in CDK2 activity began in a cell, CDK2 activity continued to increase monotonically. When DHB-Ven reached a Cyt/Nuc ratio of approximately one, cells consistently entered S phase. CDK2 activity then continued to increase for another ∼16 hr during S and G2 until the nuclear envelope broke down and the Cyt/Nuc ratio of DHB-Ven became ill-defined until nuclear envelope reformation. Our results also revealed a large cell-to-cell variation in the delay between mitogen restimulation and CDK2 activation, to the extent that some cells in the population failed to build up CDK2 activity at all during the 40 hr observation period. Finally, using siRNA targeting cyclin A, we showed that the initial rise in CDK2 activity (up to a Cyt/Nuc DHB-Ven ratio of one) did not require cyclin A, but the subsequent rise in CDK2 activity did, consistent with a requirement for cyclin A in S phase (Figure 2E). Although the emergence of cells from serum starvation has been extensively studied, it has not previously been possible to study unperturbed cells at a molecular level due to the asynchronous nature of proliferating populations. When we examined CDK2 activity traces from individual cycling MCF10A cells, we noticed two distinct behaviors (Figure 3A and Movie S2), which became even more apparent when we aligned multiple traces of CDK2 activity to the time of anaphase (Figure 3B). In the majority of MCF10A cells (75%), CDK2 activity began to increase immediately after mitosis from an intermediate level (designated CDK2inc; blue, Figure 3B); these cells had short intermitotic times of 16–20 hr. The remaining cells (25%) entered a reversible state of low CDK2 activity (designated CDK2low; red, Figure 3B); these cells had heterogeneous intermitotic times ranging from 20 hr to >50 hr, reminiscent of a G0-like state. These CDK2low cells could later re-enter the proliferative state by increasing CDK2 activity, indicating that these cells remained cell-cycle competent. Indeed, the CDK2inc and CDK2low cells are not fixed subpopulations, but rather could interconvert at mitotic exit (Figures 3A and S3). The two behaviors can be reliably distinguished as early as 2 hr after anaphase, approximately 1 hr after nuclear envelope reformation. The roughly unimodal distribution of CDK2 activity at 2 hr after anaphase quickly evolved into a clearly bimodal distribution by 4 hr after anaphase (Figure S3). We therefore set a threshold in the Cyt/Nuc ratio of DHB-Ven at 2 hr after anaphase and found that the level of CDK2 activity above or below this threshold was highly predictive of whether a cell would enter the CDK2inc or CDK2low state, respectively (Figure S3).Figure S3Additional Characterization of the Bifurcation in CDK2 Activity, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Four cells demonstrating transitions at mitosis from CDK2inc to CDK2inc, CDK2low to CDK2low, CDK2inc to CDK2low and CDK2low to CDK2inc.

Using the null hypothesis that each mitosis is independent, we obtain a Chi2 value of 28.43, and reject the null hypothesis with p < < 0.001. Thus, CDK2inc and CDK2low cells can interconvert, but the CDK2inc versus CDK2low decision is not independent of previous decisions.(C) Distribution of CDK2 activity at 2hr, 4hr, 6hr or 8hr after anaphase, for bifurcating MCF10A cells as in Figure 3B.

Thus, DHB-Ven ≤ 0.43 at 2hr after anaphase is 100% predictive of entry into the CDK2low state, whereas DHB-Ven ≥ 0.63 is 100% predictive of an immediate entry into the next cell cycle. To verify that CDK2inc and CDK2low are really two distinct cell states, we treated asynchronously cycling cells with a MEK inhibitor to test whether MEK inhibition would prevent CDK2low cells from reactivating CDK2 activity. When we examined only those cells that received MEK inhibitor 1–3 hr after anaphase, we found that we were able to block the reactivation of CDK2low cells. In contrast, MEK inhibition had no effect on the already increasing CDK2inc trajectories. Thus, a clear decision is made at the end of mitosis that causes a bifurcation in cell fate in which CDK2inc cells no longer require MEK activity to complete the next cell cycle, whereas CDK2low cells require MEK activity to transition out of the CDK2low state back to the cycling state (Figure 3C). We then examined two additional cell types, primary human foreskin fibroblasts (Hs68 cells) and a previously used model for cell-cycle progression, murine Swiss 3T3 cells. Both cell types displayed a bifurcation in CDK2 activity at mitotic exit, similar to MCF10A cells. However, the fraction of CDK2low cells was slightly larger in Hs68 cells (39%, Figure 3D) compared to MCF10A cells, and much larger in Swiss 3T3 cells (77%, Figure 3E). For both Hs68 and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, cells also tended to persist in the CDK2low state for longer durations than MCF10A cells. This argues that the bifurcation at mitotic exit is likely a general cell-cycle mechanism but that the fraction of cells bifurcating into each state as well as the time cells spend in the CDK2low state vary between cell types, growth factor concentrations, and other experimental conditions (Figure S4). To determine which cyclin partner of CDK2 was responsible for the immediate build-up of CDK2 activity after mitosis, we treated cycling cells with siRNA against cyclin E and cyclin A. Cells treated with siRNA targeting cyclin E during the previous cell cycle failed to build up CDK2 activity after mitosis and behaved similarly to CDK2low cells (Figure 3F). As in cells emerging from quiescence, cyclin A was required to raise CDK2 activity above a Cyt/Nuc DHB-Ven ratio of one. Thus, the initial rise in DHB-Ven signal requires cyclin E/CDK2 activity, after which cyclin A/CDK2 takes over in S phase. Using Cer-Cdt1 to mark the start of S phase, we found that neither the CDK2inc nor the reactivating CDK2low MCF10A cells entered into S phase until DH"

https://openalex.org/W4238403033,"Self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells are fundamentally associated with cell-cycle progression to enable tissue specification, organ homeostasis, and potentially tumorigenesis. However, technical challenges have impaired the study of the molecular interactions coordinating cell fate choice and cell-cycle progression. Here, we bypass these limitations by using the FUCCI reporter system in human pluripotent stem cells and show that their capacity of differentiation varies during the progression of their cell cycle. These mechanisms are governed by the cell-cycle regulators cyclin D1-3 that control differentiation signals such as the TGF-β-Smad2/3 pathway. Conversely, cell-cycle manipulation using a small molecule directs differentiation of hPSCs and provides an approach to generate cell types with a clinical interest. Our results demonstrate that cell fate decisions are tightly associated with the cell-cycle machinery and reveal insights in the mechanisms synchronizing differentiation and proliferation in developing tissues."

This paper reports a novel innate immune signalling pathway that depends on intercellular communication. The cytoplasmic DNA receptor cGAMP synthase (cGAS) catalyses the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP, which in turn activates type I interferon via the transmembrane protein STING. Veit Hornung and colleagues show that cGAMP is transmitted to neighbouring cells via gap junction channels and activates STING, thereby inducing an antiviral state in these bystander cells independent of paracrine interferon signalling. Bystander activation and signal amplification might prove beneficial for the restriction of viral infection, but might also aggravate disease manifestations in STING-dependent autoimmune syndromes, making it a potential target for therapeutics. The innate immune defence of multicellular organisms against microbial pathogens requires cellular collaboration. Information exchange allowing immune cells to collaborate is generally attributed to soluble protein factors secreted by pathogen-sensing cells. Cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), serve to alert non-infected cells to the possibility of pathogen challenge1. Moreover, in conjunction with chemokines they can instruct specialized immune cells to contain and eradicate microbial infection. Several receptors and signalling pathways exist that couple pathogen sensing to the induction of cytokines, whereas cytosolic recognition of nucleic acids seems to be exquisitely important for the activation of type I IFNs, master regulators of antiviral immunity2. Cytosolic DNA is sensed by the receptor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which catalyses the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP(2′-5′)3,4,5,6,7,8. This molecule in turn activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor STING9,10,11, thereby inducing an antiviral state and the secretion of type I IFNs. Here we find in murine and human cells that cGAS-synthesized cGAMP(2′-5′) is transferred from producing cells to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, where it promotes STING activation and thus antiviral immunity independently of type I IFN signalling. In line with the limited cargo specificity of connexins, the proteins that assemble gap junction channels, most connexins tested were able to confer this bystander immunity, thus indicating a broad physiological relevance of this local immune collaboration. Collectively, these observations identify cGAS-triggered cGAMP(2′-5′) transfer as a novel host strategy that serves to rapidly convey antiviral immunity in a transcription-independent, horizontal manner."

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that forms intracellular aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases collectively termed tauopathies. These include Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranculear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012Mandelkow E.M.

In tauopathies, tau accumulates in hyperphosphorylated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are visualized within dystrophic neurites and cell bodies (Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2012Mandelkow E.M.

The prion hypothesis holds that tau aggregates escape cells of origin to enter adjacent cells, where they seed further tau aggregation and propagate pathology (Frost and Diamond, 2010Frost B. Diamond M.I. Prion-like mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We have previously observed that recombinant tau fibrils will induce aggregation of full-length intracellular tau in cultured cells and that aggregated forms of tau transfer between cells (Frost et al., 2009Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. Propagation of tau misfolding from the outside to the inside of a cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Further, we found that intracellular tau fibrils are released free into the media, where they propagate aggregation by direct interaction with native tau in recipient cells. An anti-tau antibody (HJ9.3) blocks this process by preventing tau aggregate uptake into recipient cells (Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). In addition to similar experiments with recombinant tau (Guo and Lee, 2011Guo J.L. Lee V.M. Seeding of normal Tau by pathological Tau conformers drives pathogenesis of Alzheimer-like tangles.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 15317-15331Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), others have shown that paired helical filaments from AD brain induce cytoplasmic tau aggregation (Santa-Maria et al., 2012Santa-Maria I. Varghese M. Ksiezak-Reding H. Dzhun A. Wang J. Pasinetti G.M. Paired helical filaments from Alzheimer disease brain induce intracellular accumulation of Tau protein in aggresomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20522-20533Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Injection of brain extract from human P301S tau transgenic mice into the brains of mice expressing wild-type human tau induces assembly of wild-type human tau into filaments and spreading of pathology (Clavaguera et al., 2009Clavaguera F. Bolmont T. Crowther R.A. Abramowski D. Frank S. Probst A. Fraser G. Stalder A.K. Beibel M. Staufenbiel M. et al.Transmission and spreading of tauopathy in transgenic mouse brain.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Similar effects occurred after injection of recombinant full-length or truncated tau fibrils, which caused rapid induction of NFT-like inclusions that propagated from injected sites to connected brain regions in a time-dependent manner (Iba et al., 2013Iba M. Guo J.L. McBride J.D. Zhang B. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Synthetic tau fibrils mediate transmission of neurofibrillary tangles in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s-like tauopathy.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 1024-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Selective tau expression in the entorhinal cortex caused late pathology in the axonal terminal zones in cells in the dentate gyrus and hippocampus, consistent with transsynaptic movement of aggregates (de Calignon et al., 2012de Calignon A. Polydoro M. Suárez-Calvet M. William C. Adamowicz D.H. Kopeikina K.J. Pitstick R. Sahara N. Ashe K.H.

A growing body of work thus supports the idea that tau aggregates transfer between cells and might be targeted with therapeutic antibodies. In mouse models that mimic aspects of AD and Parkinson’s disease, passive immunization using antibodies against Aβ and alpha synuclein can reduce Aβ and alpha-synuclein deposition in brain (Bard et al., 2000Bard F.

Alzheimer Res. 2012; 9: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In two passive vaccination studies, there was reduced tau pathology and improved motor function when the antibody was given prior to the onset of pathology (Boutajangout et al., 2011Boutajangout A. Ingadottir J. Davies P. Sigurdsson E.M. Passive immunization targeting pathological phospho-tau protein in a mouse model reduces functional decline and clears tau aggregates from the brain.J.

Chem. 2011; 286: 34457-34467Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). While several of the tau immunization studies appear to show some beneficial effects, the maximal expected efficacy of anti-tau antibodies administered after the onset of pathology, the optimal tau species to target, and the mechanism of the therapeutic effect have remained unknown. Our prior work in cell culture has suggested that aggregate flux in and out of cells might be central to progressive pathology (Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Thus, we predicted that antibodies that specifically block P301S brain-derived seeding activity might block propagation between cells and decrease overall tau pathology. We have used P301S human tau transgenic mice (Yoshiyama et al., 2007Yoshiyama Y. Higuchi M. Zhang B. Huang S.M. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Maeda J. Suhara T. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.

We have previously observed that tau aggregates, but not monomer, are up taken by cultured cells and that internalized tau aggregates trigger intracellular tau aggregation in recipient cells (Frost et al., 2009Frost B. Jacks R.L. Diamond M.I. Propagation of tau misfolding from the outside to the inside of a cell.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12845-12852Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). We characterized the HJ8 series of eight mouse monoclonal antibodies (raised against full-length human tau) and HJ9 series of five antibodies (raised against full-length mouse tau) in an adapted cellular biosensor system we have previously described (Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) that measures cellular tau aggregation induced by the addition of brain lysates containing tau aggregates. The antibodies had variable effects in blocking seeding, despite the fact that all antibodies efficiently bind tau monomer and stain neurofibrillary tangles. We selected three antibodies with different potencies in blocking seeding for our studies. Prior to testing in vivo, we determined the binding affinities and epitopes of the antibodies, which are all IgG2b isotype. We immobilized human and mouse tau on a sensor chip CM5 for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Figure 1). The HJ9.3 antibody, raised against mouse tau, recognizes both human (Figure 1A) and mouse (Figure 1B) tau with the same binding constant (KD = Kd/Ka = 100 pM) (Figure 1G). The association (Ka) and dissociation (Kd) rate constants were calculated by using BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB) selecting Fit kinetics simultaneous Ka/Kd (Global fitting) with 1:1 (Langmuir) interaction model. The Ka and Kd of HJ9.3 toward human (Ka = 7.5 × 104 Ms−1, Kd = 7.5 × 10−6 s−1) and mouse (Ka = 8.6 × 104 Ms−1, Kd = 9.1 × 10−6 s−1) indicate strong binding to both. We mapped the epitope of HJ9.3 to the repeat domain (RD) region, between amino acids 306–320. HJ9.4, raised against mouse tau, had high affinity KD (2.2 pM) toward mouse tau with a high association rate constant (Ka = 2.28 × 105 Ms−1) and very low dissociation constant (Kd = 5.1 × 10−7 s−1) (Figures 1D and 1G). However, the same antibody had a much lower affinity (KD = 6.9 nM) toward human tau (Figures 1C and 1G), with a similar association rate constant (Ka = 1.5 × 105 Ms−1) as mouse tau but with much faster dissociation (Kd = 1.07 × 10−3 s−1). Thus, the HJ9.4 interaction with human tau is less stable than with mouse tau. The epitope for this antibody is amino acids 7–13. HJ8.5 was raised against human tau. It binds to human tau (Figure 1E) but not to mouse tau (Figure 1F). The KD (0.3 pM) (Figures 1E and 1G) and low dissociation rate (Kd = 4.38 × 10−8 s−1) indicate that HJ8.5 binds human tau with very high affinity. We mapped the epitope of HJ8.5 to amino acids 25–30. All three anti-tau antibodies strongly recognized human tau fibrils on SPR (Figure S1 available online). Because the fibrils have multiple identical epitopes, we could not directly calculate the association and dissociation rates. We also assessed the antibodies by immunoblotting and immunostaining. On western blots, all three antibodies bound to human tau (Figure 1H). HJ9.3 and HJ9.4 bound to mouse tau, while HJ8.5 did not (Figure 1H). Consistent with our prior findings (Yamada et al., 2011Yamada K. Cirrito J.R. Stewart F.R. Jiang H. Finn M.B. Holmes B.B. Binder L.I. Mandelkow E.M. Diamond M.I. Lee V.M. Holtzman D.M. In vivo microdialysis reveals age-dependent decrease of brain interstitial fluid tau levels in P301S human tau transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13110-13117Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), there appeared to be less reassembly buffer (RAB)-soluble tau in 9-month-old compared to 3-month-old P301S mice. We found that HJ8.5 stained human tau in 3-month-old and 9- to 12-month-old transgenic P301S mouse brains. Tau immunoreactivity was present throughout the cell bodies and processes (Figure S2). In 9- to 12-month-old P301S mice with tau aggregates, HJ8.5 detected tau aggregates in cell bodies (Figure S2A). Other antibodies produced similar results (Figure S2B). All antibodies bound to neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in AD brain (Figure S2). To evaluate seeding activity present in P301S brain lysates, we adapted a cellular biosensor system that we have previously described (Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This is based on expression of the repeat domain of tau (aa 243–375) containing the ΔK280 mutation fused either to cyan or yellow fluorescent protein (RD(ΔK)-CFP/YFP). Uptake of exogenous aggregates into these cells triggers intracellular aggregation of RD(ΔK)-CFP/YFP that is detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) recorded on a fluorescence plate reader (Kfoury et al., 2012Kfoury N. Holmes B.B. Jiang H. Holtzman D.M. Diamond M.I. Trans-cellular propagation of Tau aggregation by fibrillar species.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19440-19451Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Clarified brain lysates from 12-month-old P301S mice added to the biosensor cell system induced strong aggregation of the RD(ΔK)-CFP/YFP reporter, indicating the presence of tau seeding activity (Figure 2A). The seeding activity from 12-month-old P301S brain homogenate mice roughly corresponds to 50 nM (monomer equivalent) of recombinant full-length fibrils (data not shown). There was little to no aggregation induced by lysates from tau knockout mice, wild-type mice, or 3-month-old P301S mice lacking tau pathology (Figure 2A). We assessed the anti-tau antibodies (HJ8.5, HJ9.3, and HJ9.4) for their ability to block the uptake and seeding activity from the 12-month-old P301S brain lysates. HJ3.4 (mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody) was a negative control. The anti-tau antibodies effectively blocked seeding activity (Figure 2B). To determine their relative efficacy, we titrated the antibodies (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg/ml) against a fixed amount of P301S brain lysate (Figure 2C). The HJ8.5 antibody blocked seeding activity at concentrations as low as 0.25 μg/ml compared to controls. At 0.5 μg/ml, both HJ8.5 and HJ9.3 antibody significantly blocked uptake and seeding activity compared to control. HJ9.4 was least potent in blocking the uptake and seeding activity, consistent with its higher affinity for mouse tau. All three anti-tau antibodies detected tau aggregates internalized after uptake by HEK293 cells, as detected by post hoc cellular permeabilization and staining. However, when these antibodies were preincubated with and without P301S brain lysates, none of these antibodies were detected inside cells upon staining with anti-mouse secondary antibody (Figure S3). While other modes of inhibition are possible, these data are consistent with a mechanism based on blocking cellular uptake of tau aggregates. To further assess tau seeding activity present in TBS-soluble P301S brain lysates, we immunoprecipitated lysates with the different antibodies and assessed both the bound and unbound fractions for seeding activity. After control HJ3.4 immunoprecipitation, the unbound fraction had strong seeding activity and the immunoprecipitated material had no seeding activity (Figure 2D). After immunoprecipitaton with HJ8.5 and HJ9.3, the unbound fraction had no significant seeding activity, and with HJ9.4, the unbound material had reduced seeding activity. After elution from the anti-tau antibodies, the immunoprecipitated material had strong seeding activity. To assess the tau seeds, we analyzed these fractions by nondenaturing blots (semidenaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis [SDD-AGE]) (Halfmann and Lindquist, 2008Halfmann R. Lindquist S. Screening for amyloid aggregation by semi-denaturing detergent-agarose gel electrophoresis.J. Vis. Exp. 2008; (Published online July 16, 2008)https://doi.org/10.3791/838Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and by denaturing blots (SDS-PAGE) followed by western blotting for tau. SDD-AGE of immunoprecipitated tau revealed monomer and multiple larger species that are probably oligomeric (Figure 2E). The unbound material had some residual tau species but less than what was present in the immunoprecipated material. HJ3.4 did not immunoprecipitate any tau species. Western blot following SDS-PAGE (Figure 2F) revealed that the tau multimers were denatured to predominantly tau monomer, but the overall patterns were similar. Although tauopathy is associated with detergent-insoluble tau, we observed that TBS-soluble brain lysates contain tau seeding activity. To characterize the tau present in this fraction, we evaluated the immunoprecipitated material by atomic force microscopy (AFM). HJ3.4 immunoprecipiated no aggregated material. Interestingly, each tau antibody immunoprecipitated unique forms of aggregated material (Figure 3), consistent with a multiplicity of aggregated tau species. In our colonies, P301S mice first develop intracellular tau pathology beginning at 5 months of age. To test the efficacy of the three antibodies by chronic intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration, we surgically implanted a catheter into the left lateral ventricle of each mouse at 6 months of age and continuously infused anti-tau antibodies for 3 months via Alzet subcutaneous osmotic minipump (Figure S4A). We used anti-Aβ antibody HJ3.4 and PBS as negative controls. After 6 weeks, we replaced each pump with one filled with fresh antibody solution or PBS. At the time of brain dissection, we verified catheter placement in the left lateral ventricle of each mouse by cresyl violet staining (Figure S4B). Only mice with correctly placed catheters were included in the analyses. To test the stability of the antibodies after 6 weeks in vivo (Figure S4A), we collected residual pump contents upon removal from the animals and assessed the antibodies using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Light and heavy chains were intact, with no fragmentation, and retained tau binding activity on western blot (data not shown). To estimate the concentration of anti-tau antibodies in CSF and serum during the infusion, we administered biotinylated HJ8.5 (HJ8.5B) for 48 hr (∼7.2 μg/day) (Figure S4A). The concentration of free HJ8.5B was 7.3 μg/ml in the CSF and 6.2 μg/ml in the serum, indicating clearance of the antibody from the CNS to the periphery (Figure S4C). We also detected HJ8.5B bound to human tau in both CSF and serum, though the concentration was lower than that of free antibody (Figure S4C). To determine the extent of tau pathology in P301S mice after 3 months of treatment, we carried out multiple stains for tau pathology. Brain sections were first assessed by immunostaining with the anti-phospho tau antibody AT8 (Figure 4). AT8 binds phosphorylated residues Ser202 and Thr205 of both mouse and human tau (Figure 4) (Goedert et al., 1995Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Monoclonal antibody AT8 recognises tau protein phosphorylated at both serine 202 and threonine 205.Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 189: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In mice treated with PBS and HJ3.4, AT8 strongly stained neuronal cell bodies and the neuropil in multiple brain regions, particularly in the piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus (Figures 4A and 4B). HJ8.5 treatment strongly reduced AT8 staining (Figure 4C), especially in the neuropil. HJ9.3 and HJ9.4 also decreased AT8 staining but the effects were slightly less (Figures 4D and 4E). Quantitative analysis of AT8 staining in piriform cortex (Figure 5A), entorhinal cortex (Figure 5B), and amygdala (Figure 5C) demonstrated a strong but variable reduction in phospho-tau in all anti-tau antibody-treated mice. HJ8.5 antibody markedly reduced AT8 staining in piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. HJ9.3 had slightly decreased effects compared to HJ8.5, and HJ9.4 had significant effects in both entorhinal cortex and amygdala but not in the piriform cortex (Figure 5). The hippocampus exhibited much more variable AT8 staining versus other brain regions, predominantly in cell bodies, and thus was not statistically different in treatment versus control groups (Figure 5D). Because it has been reported that male P301S mice have greater tau pathology than females (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang B. Carroll J. Trojanowski J.Q. Yao Y. Iba M. Potuzak J.S. Hogan A.M. Xie S.X. Ballatore C. Smith 3rd, A.B. et al.The microtubule-stabilizing agent, epothilone D, reduces axonal dysfunction, neurotoxicity, cognitive deficits, and Alzheimer-like pathology in an interventional study with aged tau transgenic mice.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 3601-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), we also assessed the effect of both gender and treatment (Figure S5). In addition to an effect of treatment, there was significantly more AT8 staining in all brain regions analyzed in male mice (Figure S5C). However, the effects of the antibodies were still highly significant and virtually identical after adjusting for gender (Figure S5D). We also compared the treatment groups versus controls in males and females separately, and the effects of antibody HJ8.5 remained most significant (Figures S5A and S5B).Figure 5Certain Anti-Tau Antibodies Strongly Decrease AT8 Staining in P301S Mouse BrainShow full captionPercent of"
https://openalex.org/W2115088504,"Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. Here, in human, rat and mouse, we identify a novel mechanism linking CaMKII and hyperglycaemic signalling in diabetes mellitus, which is a key risk factor for heart and neurodegenerative diseases. Acute hyperglycaemia causes covalent modification of CaMKII by O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII at Ser 279 activates CaMKII autonomously, creating molecular memory even after Ca(2+) concentration declines. O-GlcNAc-modified CaMKII is increased in the heart and brain of diabetic humans and rats. In cardiomyocytes, increased glucose concentration significantly enhances CaMKII-dependent activation of spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events that can contribute to cardiac mechanical dysfunction and arrhythmias. These effects were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of O-GlcNAc signalling or genetic ablation of CaMKIIδ. In intact perfused hearts, arrhythmias were aggravated by increased glucose concentration through O-GlcNAc- and CaMKII-dependent pathways. In diabetic animals, acute blockade of O-GlcNAc inhibited arrhythmogenesis. Thus, O-GlcNAc modification of CaMKII is a novel signalling event in pathways that may contribute critically to cardiac and neuronal pathophysiology in diabetes and other diseases."

This previously unrecognized role for MFN2 argues for a crucial involvement in mediating ER stress-induced leptin resistance. The mediobasal hypothalamus is a critical area of the central nervous system implicated in the regulation of homeostatic functions. Specific populations of neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) play fundamental roles in the regulation of energy balance (Williams and Elmquist, 2012Williams K.W. Elmquist J.K. From neuroanatomy to behavior: central integration of peripheral signals regulating feeding behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1350-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In particular, neurons coexpressing orexigenic neuropeptides agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) along with neurons coexpressing anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor and cocaine and amphetamine-related transcript (CART) have been extensively involved in the regulation of appetite, body weight, and metabolism (Diéguez et al., 2011Diéguez C.

A hallmark of obesity is leptin resistance, in which high-circulating leptin levels are unable to promote its central anorexigenic effects (Bjørbaek, 2009Bjørbaek C. Central leptin receptor action and resistance in obesity.J. Investig. Med. 2009; 57: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). POMC neurons are primary targets of leptin in the hypothalamus and evidence suggests that alterations in this subset of neurons may mediate the development of hypothalamic leptin resistance (Bjørbaek, 2009Bjørbaek C.

Recent data demonstrate that enhanced hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) play a primary pathogenic role in leptin resistance development. For example, both diet-induced and genetic models of obesity have been associated with increased ER stress in the hypothalamus (Ozcan et al., 2009Ozcan L. Ergin A.S. Lu A. Chung J. Sarkar S. Nie D.

Despite the strong link between ER stress and leptin resistance in the hypothalamus, the cellular and molecular determinants involved remain elusive. The ER and mitochondria form contacts that support essential structural and functional interorganelle communication, a process that is partially modulated by mitochondrial fusion and fission (Rowland and Voeltz, 2012Rowland A.A. Voeltz G.K. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contacts: function of the junction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 607-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Recent evidences indicate that Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial transmembrane dynamin-like GTPase protein, plays fundamental roles in both mitochondrial fusion (Chen et al., 2003Chen H. Detmer S.A. Ewald A.J. Griffin E.E. Fraser S.E. Chan D.C. Mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2 coordinately regulate mitochondrial fusion and are essential for embryonic development.J.

Mitofusin 2 tethers endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.Nature. 2008; 456: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, mitochondrial and ER dysfunctions have been associated with the development of metabolic alterations and recent data suggest a key role for MFN2 in the pathophysiology of obesity and type 2 diabetes in both humans and rodents (Bach et al., 2005Bach D.

USA. 2012; 109: 5523-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These evidences encouraged us to hypothesize that MFN2 in POMC neurons may be a molecular link between ER stress and leptin resistance in the hypothalamus. Here, we provide evidence that mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-ER interactions in POMC neurons are altered in diet-induced obesity (DIO). Our data also indicate that Mfn2 deficiency in this population of neurons causes loss of mitochondria-ER contacts, ER stress, leptin resistance, and reduced α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) production, leading to severe obesity. These results unravel an unexpected role for MFN2 in the regulation of POMC neuronal function and hypothalamic ER stress to appropriately regulate whole-body energy balance. The cellular adaptations to fluctuations in nutrient availability involve the regulation of mitochondrial function, a process that is intimately associated with changes in mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondria-ER interactions (Baltzer et al., 2010Baltzer C.

Mitochondrial fission, fusion, and stress.Science. 2012; 337: 1062-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). We assessed potential alterations in POMC neuron mitochondrial network complexity caused by energy excess in DIO mice using confocal microscopy. Aspect ratio (AR) and form factor (FF), parameters associated with mitochondria length and branching, respectively, were decreased in POMC neurons from DIO mice when compared to lean controls (Figures 1A, 1B, S1A, and S1B available online). The positive correlation between mitochondria AR and FF in POMC neurons from lean mice was lost in DIO mice (Figure 1C). To further examine the effects of nutrient excess in POMC neurons, we conducted electron microscopy (EM) analysis. As previously described, mitochondrial density in POMC neurons from DIO mice was increased (Diano et al., 2011Diano S. Liu Z.W. Jeong J.K. Dietrich M.O. Ruan H.B. Kim E. Suyama S. Kelly K. Gyengesi E. Arbiser J.L. et al.Peroxisome proliferation-associated control of reactive oxygen species sets melanocortin tone and feeding in diet-induced obesity.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar; data not shown). Interestingly, DIO mice showed a significant reduction in the number of mitochondria-ER contacts in POMC neurons when compared to lean controls (Figures 1D and 1E). Collectively, these results indicate that both mitochondrial network complexity and their association to ER in POMC neurons are altered in DIO mice. A candidate protein to mediate the alterations in mitochondria-ER contacts and mitochondrial network observed in DIO mice is MFN2. To initially assess this, we conducted a time course study and analyzed the expression of genes implicated in mitochondrial dynamics in the hypothalamus of lean and DIO mice at different time points. Although 4 days of high-fat diet (HFD) did not cause changes in body weight (Figure 1F), hypothalamic Mfn2 expression was already downregulated (Figure 1G). Reduced Mfn2 expression in the hypothalamus was observed throughout the study (Figure 1G). Expression of mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1) remained unchanged (Figures S1C–S1F). Next, we assessed whether adenovirus-mediated overexpression of MFN2 in the ARC of DIO mice was able to improve their metabolic alterations. Localization studies showed correct delivery of the adenovirus (Figure 2A). MFN2 overexpression (Figure 2B) in the ARC of DIO mice resulted in reduced body weight (Figure 2C), adiposity (Figure 2D), and plasma leptin levels (Figure 2E). This was associated with diminished food intake (Figure 2F) and increased interscapular surface temperature adjacent to brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 2G). Consistent with this, the expression of BAT thermogenic marker uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) was upregulated (Figure 2H), while the trend in hypothalamic neuropeptide expression was congruent with increased anorexigenic output (Figure 2I). Remarkably, MFN2 overexpression in the ARC attenuated the hypothalamic DIO-induced expression of ER stress markers such as Bip, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (Chop), spliced form of X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1s), activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4) and 6 (Atf6) (Figure 2J). Together, these results suggest that MFN2 in the hypothalamus may underlie the metabolic alterations of DIO mice, and hence it can be a relevant protein implicated in the central regulation of energy balance. MFN2 immunoreactivity was widely observed in the ARC including POMC neurons (Figure S2A). To explore the role of MFN2 in POMC neurons upon the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis, we generated POMC neuron-specific Mfn2 knockout mice (POMCMfn2KO). We confirmed tissue-specific recombination of the Mfn2-floxed allele in the hypothalamus (Figure S2B). We also detected reduction in Mfn2 gene expression but not in other mitochondrial dynamics genes in the hypothalamus (Figure S2C). The POMC promoter also drives cre recombinase expression in corticotrophs and melanotrophs, so we examined the integrity and functionality of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Expression of pituitary genes Pomc, T box transcription factor (Tpit), corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 (Crhr1), pituitary-specific transcription factor 1 (Pit1), growth hormone (Gh), and thyroid-stimulating hormone beta-chain (Tshβ) were unaltered (Figure S2D). Plasma corticosterone levels were equivalent between control and POMCMfn2KO mice under basal conditions, and the stress response was preserved (Figure S2E). Epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine concentrations were normal in mutant mice (Figures S2F–S2H). These results indicate that deletion of Mfn2 in pituitary cells does not cause defects in the pituitary-adrenal axis. Anatomical assessment of POMC neurons throughout the ARC revealed no alterations in neuronal population size, distribution, or somatic area (Figures S2I–S2K), indicating that Mfn2 deficiency did not alter POMC neuron differentiation and/or survival. Male POMCMfn2KO mice exhibited a marked obese phenotype that was significant by 7 weeks of age onward (Figure 3A). POMCMfn2KO mice were hyperphagic both under ad libitum conditions (Figure 3B) and after a fast-refeeding test (Figure 3C), suggesting impaired satiety mechanisms. Female mutant mice displayed a similar phenotype (data not shown), so we undertook subsequent studies in male mice. Altered energy homeostasis in POMCMfn2KO mice was further demonstrated by reduced oxygen consumption and energy expenditure (Figures 3D and 3E). Given that energy expenditure includes physical activity and thermogenesis, we undertook studies to measure these parameters. Ambulation activity was unchanged (control: 6,016 ± 453 counts/24 hr; POMCMfn2KO: 7,174 ± 567 counts/24 hr; n = 7–8, NS). However, interscapular temperature adjacent to BAT was reduced in mutant mice (Figures 3F and 3G). Consistently, mRNA expression of BAT thermogenic markers Ucp1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Pgc1α) were decreased in POMCMfn2KO mice (Figure 3H). Obesity is closely associated with alterations in glucose metabolism. As expected, 12-week-old mutant mice exhibited hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (data not shown). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the obese phenotype observed in POMCMfn2KO mice is due to hyperphagia and reduced activity of the thermogenic program. To assess the specificity of the metabolic consequences caused by Mfn2 deficiency in POMC neurons, we characterized mice lacking MFN1 (a closely related mitofusin protein) in the same population of neurons (POMCMfn1KO). Appropriate deletion of Mfn1 was assessed by the recombination event and gene expression analysis (data not shown and Figure S3A). The pituitary-adrenal axis function was preserved as suggested by unaltered expression of pituitary genes (Figure S3B), plasma corticosterone (Figure S3C) and catecholamines (Figures S3D–S3F). In contrast to POMCMfn2KO mice, energy balance parameters such as body weight (Figure S3G), adiposity (Figure S3H), plasma leptin levels (Figure S3I) and feeding behavior (Figures S3J and S3K) were unaltered in POMCMfn1KO mice. Oxygen consumption (Figure S3L), energy expenditure (Figure S3M), interscapular temperature (Figure S3N), and 24 hr ambulation activity (data not shown) were comparable between mutant and control mice. Consistent with the lack of alterations in energy homeostasis, hypothalamic neuropeptide expression was unchanged (Figure S3O). These results demonstrate a specific role for MFN2 in POMC neurons in the regulation of energy balance. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the hypothalamic phenotype of POMCMfn2KO mice, we assessed neuropeptide gene expression. While mRNA expression of Agrp, Npy, and Cart exhibited no differences between genotypes and appropriate regulation according to the nutritional status (Figure 4A), Pomc mRNA in mutant mice was downregulated and insensitive to the fed/fasting transition (Figure 4A). Reduced fasting Pomc gene expression was also observed in 6-week-old mutant mice (control: 100% ± 7% versus POMCMfn2KO: 44% ± 4%; n = 12–16, p < 0.0001). POMC is a prohormone that in the ARC undergoes posttranslational proteolysis by the sequential activity of different convertases to generate α-MSH, a key melanocortin system component implicated in energy homeostasis (Wardlaw, 2011Wardlaw S.L. Hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin processing and the regulation of energy balance.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2011; 660: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Hence, we measured POMC and α-MSH content in hypothalamic extracts from 6- and 12-week-old control and POMCMfn2KO mice. Whereas total POMC content was increased in the hypothalamus from mutant mice (Figure 4B), α-MSH content was decreased by ∼50%–60% at both ages (Figure 4C). The α-MSH/POMC ratio, a measure of POMC precursor processing, was also decreased (Figure 4D). However, reduced α-MSH concentration did not seem to be the consequence of defective expression of processing enzymes, since mRNA levels of prohormone convertase 1 (Pc1/3), prohormone convertase 2 (Pc2), carboxypeptidase E (Cpe), α-amidating monooxygenase (Pam), and prolylcarboxypeptidase (Prcp) were either unchanged or regulated in opposite manner (Figures 4E and 4F). α-MSH is released from POMC axonal terminals to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus where exerts its anorexigenic actions. Thus, we examined α-MSH peptide expression in the PVN by immunohistochemistry and found a dramatic reduction of α-MSH staining in neuronal projections from mutant mice (Figures 4G and 4H). To investigate whether the obese phenotype in POMCMfn2KO mice resulted from reduced α-MSH production, we assessed the anorectic effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of this peptide. A daily single dose of α-MSH to POMCMfn2KO mice normalized food intake and markedly reduced body weight gain (Figures 4I and 4J). Collectively, our data suggest that deletion of Mfn2 in POMC neurons leads to reduced α-MSH concentration in the hypothalamus, this defect being the cause of the POMCMfn2KO obese phenotype. The obese phenotype of POMCMfn2KO mice resulted from increased adiposity (Figure 5A). Consistently, plasma leptin levels were also elevated (Figure 5B), a scenario indicative of leptin resistance. To examine leptin action in POMCMfn2KO mice we performed a leptin sensitivity test. The anorectic effects of leptin were clearly detectable in 12-week-old control mice. In contrast, the effect of this hormone was blunted in POMCMfn2KO mice, suggesting leptin resistance (Figures 5C and 5D). We next asked whether defective leptin sensitivity in POMCMfn2KO mice was a primary defect or secondary to the development of obesity. Thus, we assessed leptin sensitivity at 6 weeks of age when body weight (control: 22.1 ± 0.3 g; POMCMfn2KO: 21.0 ± 1.5 g; n = 6, NS; Figure 3A) and adiposity (control: 13.7% ± 0.8%; POMCMfn2KO: 14.2% ± 1.0%; n = 6, NS) were still unchanged. The anorectic effects of exogenous leptin were significantly attenuated in mice lacking MFN2 in POMC neurons (Figures 5E and 5F; reduction in food intake vehicle versus leptin: control 49% ± 3%, POMCMfn2KO 35% ± 2%; n = 6, p = 0.005). To confirm these findings we examined leptin signaling by double immunofluorescence analysis of phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) in POMC neurons. Leptin administration increased pSTAT3 in POMC neurons of control mice, but to a significantly lesser extent in POMC neurons from 6-week-old POMCMfn2KO mice (Figures 5G and 5H). Together, these results indicate that deletion of Mfn2 in POMC neurons leads to an early state of leptin resistance in the hypothalamus that is independent of obesity. It has been shown that ER stress plays a key role in the development of leptin resistance and obesity (Ozcan et al., 2009Ozcan L. Ergin A.S. Lu A. Chung J. Sarkar S. Nie D. Myers Jr., M.G. Ozcan U.

Given that MFN2 supports structural and functional communication between mitochondria and ER (de Brito and Scorrano, 2008de Brito O.M. Scorrano L.

Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 5523-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), we investigated whether deletion of Mfn2 in POMC neurons leads to alterations in mitochondria and ER homeostasis. Ultrastructure analysis by EM showed similar density of mitochondria related to cell size in POMC neurons from mutant mice (Figures 6A–6C), concomitant with an increase in mitochondria coverage of the cell area (Figure 6D). This change was due to enlarged mitochondria (Figure 6E), which also presented altered shape (Figure 6A, 6B, and 6F). Mitochondria from POMC neurons lacking MFN2 also contained smaller and more rounded cristae (data not shown). Remarkably, while most mitochondria in control POMC neurons showed close interactions with ER, the number of mitochondria-ER contacts was significantly reduced in POMC neurons from POMCMfn2KO mice (Figures 6A, 6B, and 6G). Similar results were observed in POMC neuron mitochondria from nonobese 6-week-old mutant mice (Figures S4A and S4B), indicating that these alterations precede the onset of obesity. These results imply MFN2 as a critical protein in the maintenance of mitochondria morphology and mitochondria-ER interactions in hypothalamic POMC neurons.Figure S4Mitochondria-ER Contacts and Expression of Hypothalamic ER Stress Markers in POMCMfn2KO Mice, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A) Representative EM images of POMC neurons from nonobese 6-week-old control and POMCMfn2KO mice.

We show here that the osteoblast-derived hormone osteocalcin crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to neurons of the brainstem, midbrain, and hippocampus, enhances the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters, inhibits GABA synthesis, prevents anxiety and depression, and favors learning and memory independently of its metabolic functions. In addition to these postnatal functions, maternal osteocalcin crosses the placenta during pregnancy and prevents neuronal apoptosis before embryos synthesize this hormone. As a result, the severity of the neuroanatomical defects and learning and memory deficits of Osteocalcin−/− mice is determined by the maternal genotype, and delivering osteocalcin to pregnant Osteocalcin−/− mothers rescues these abnormalities in their Osteocalcin−/− progeny. This study reveals that the skeleton via osteocalcin influences cognition and contributes to the maternal influence on fetal brain development.

Bone was recently identified as an endocrine organ (Guntur and Rosen, 2012Guntur A.R. Rosen C.J. Bone as an endocrine organ.Endocr. Pract. 2012; 18: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A hormone secreted by osteoblasts, osteocalcin, affects physiological processes as diverse as energy expenditure, glucose homeostasis, and male fertility (Ferron et al., 2010Ferron M. Wei J.

The latter function of osteocalcin led to the identification of its only known receptor, Gprc6a, which is expressed on Leydig cells (Oury et al., 2010Oury F. Yadav V.K. Wang Y. Zhou B. Liu X.S. Guo X.E. Tecott L.H. Schutz G. Means A.R. Karsenty G.

Given that most hormones act in many organs and regulate multiple physiological processes, it is likely that the spectrum of endocrine functions of osteocalcin is broader than what is already known. In another development of skeletal biology, the brain was shown to determine bone mass accrual (Karsenty and Ferron, 2012Karsenty G. Ferron M. The contribution of bone to whole-organism physiology.Nature. 2012; 481: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This was revealed while studying the mechanisms whereby leptin inhibits bone mass accrual in mice, rats, sheep, and humans (Ducy et al., 2000Ducy P. Amling M. Takeda S. Priemel M. Schilling A.F.

A systematic, step-wise, and cell-specific genetic dissection in the mouse demonstrated that leptin does so by signaling in brainstem neurons to prevent the synthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that decreases the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, which in turn inhibits bone mass accrual (Oury et al., 2010Oury F.

The importance of this serotonin-dependent regulation of bone mass accrual is evidenced by the fact that serotonin reuptake inhibitors that increase intrasynaptic concentrations of serotonin in the brain can affect bone mass in humans (Gardier et al., 1996Gardier A.M. Malagié I. Trillat A.C. Jacquot C. Artigas F.

Pharmacol. 1996; 10: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because it is so powerful (the absence of leptin signaling overrides the deleterious effect of the lack of sex steroid hormones on bone mass), this mode of regulation of bone mass raises the following questions: does bone signal back to the brain? If it does, what are the identities and functions of these bone-derived signals? These questions are also prompted by a clinical observation. Patients affected with Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a disease caused by mutations in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2, often demonstrate cognitive impairment (McBrien et al., 2006McBrien H.

Clinical outcome studies and experimental evidence gathered in animal models both indicate that maternal health during pregnancy is a determinant of embryonic development (Challis, 2012Challis J.R.

Any direct maternal influence on vertebrate embryonic development should occur through the placenta, an organ allowing the transfer of circulating molecules from the mother to the embryo. However, maternally derived molecules that cross the placenta and affect brain development and functions in the progeny have not yet been identified. Because maternal health is a risk factor for neurologic and psychiatric diseases in the offspring, this is an important question to study (Van den Bergh et al., 2005Van den Bergh B.R. Mulder E.J. Mennes M. Glover V. Antenatal maternal anxiety and stress and the neurobehavioural development of the fetus and child: links and possible mechanisms. A review.Neurosci. Biobehav.

Rev. 2008; 32: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). This study was initiated to determine whether the skeleton regulates any function of the brain. Testing this hypothesis revealed that osteocalcin crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), binds to neurons in the brainstem, midbrain, and hippocampus, and influences the synthesis of several neurotransmitters. Consequently, osteocalcin favors postnatally, and independently of its metabolic role, several behaviors by signaling in the brain. As importantly, during pregnancy maternal osteocalcin crosses the placenta and prevents neuronal apoptosis in the embryo before it can synthesize this hormone. This explains why this pool of osteocalcin determines the quality of spatial learning and memory in adult offspring. These results indicate that the skeleton via osteocalcin regulates cognition and is a mediator of the maternal influence on brain development and functions of the offspring (Broad and Keverne, 2011Broad K.D.

The passivity of the Ocn−/− mice, a feature reported by all investigators handling them since they were generated, was quantified by comparing their locomotion to that of wild-type (WT) littermates during light and dark phases or over 30 min of an open-field paradigm test (Figures 1A–1C). Both assays showed a significant decrease in locomotion in 3-month-old Ocn−/− mice. Given that this analysis was conducted in female mice, this decrease in locomotion could not be ascribed to a lack of sex steroid hormones as their synthesis is not regulated by osteocalcin in female mice (Oury et al., 2011Oury F. Sumara G. Sumara O. Ferron M. Chang H. Smith C.E. Hermo L. Suarez S. Roth B.L. Ducy P. Karsenty G.

Locomotion was normal in mice lacking Gprc6a, the only known receptor for osteocalcin (Figures 1A–1C), implying that the passivity of Ocn−/− mice may not be a consequence of their metabolic abnormalities since these are equally severe in Ocn−/− and Gprc6a−/− mice (Figures S1B–S1E). This was further addressed by including Gprc6a−/− mice in subsequent experiments.Figure S1Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Treadmill analysis of Ocn−/− (n = 8) and their littermates control (n = 7).

The statistical test on the top of each graph represents the Student’s t test; p < 0.05 is significant. To determine whether this passivity was caused by perturbations in neurotransmitters that have accumulated in the brain, we measured neurotransmitter content in various areas of the brain of 3-month-old WT, Ocn−/−, and Gprc6a−/− mice. This analysis showed that GABA content was increased in all brain areas tested in Ocn−/− compared to WT mice (Figure 1D). In contrast, norepinephrine and serotonin contents were significantly decreased in the brainstem, whereas that of dopamine was decreased in the midbrain, cortex, and striatum of Ocn−/− mice (Figures 1E–1G). Glutamate levels were normal in the brains of Ocn−/− mice (Figure S1I). The contents of all these neurotransmitters were similar in WT and Gprc6a−/− brains (Figures S1F–S1H). An explanation for the changes in neurotransmitter accumulation in Ocn−/− mice is the alteration in expression of genes necessary for neurotransmitter biosynthesis. Expression of Gad1 and Gad2, two enzymes required for GABA biosynthesis, was increased in the brainstems of Ocn−/− mice (Figure 1H). Expression of Tph2, the gene encoding the initial enzyme needed for brain serotonin synthesis (Walther et al., 2003Walther D.J. Peter J.U. Bashammakh S. Hörtnagl H. Voits M. Fink H. Bader M. Synthesis of serotonin by a second tryptophan hydroxylase isoform.Science. 2003; 299: 76Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), and of Th that encodes the initial enzyme in dopamine and norepinephrine synthesis (Daubner et al., 2011Daubner S.C.

Sci. 2008; 1129: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) was decreased in the brainstem and midbrain, respectively (Figure 1H). Conversely, in Esp−/− mice, which display an increase in the circulating levels of the undercarboxylated form of osteocalcin (Lee et al., 2007Lee N.K. Sowa H. Hinoi E. Ferron M. Ahn J.D. Confavreux C. Dacquin R. Mee P.J. McKee M.D. Jung D.Y. et al.Endocrine regulation of energy metabolism by the skeleton.Cell. 2007; 130: 456-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar), Tph2 expression in the brainstem was increased (Figure S1J). All these genes were normally expressed in Gprc6a−/− mice (Figure 1H), further suggesting that osteocalcin affects the synthesis of neurotransmitters in a Gprc6a-independent manner. The increase in the content of GABA and the decrease of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin and catecholamine) in the brains of Ocn−/− mice should hamper their behavior. This was assessed in female WT, Ocn−/−, and Gprc6a−/− mice. Anxiety-like behavior was analyzed by three conflict-based tests. The dark/light transition test exploits the innate aversion of rodents to brightly illuminated areas (Crawley, 1985Crawley J.N. Exploratory behavior models of anxiety in mice.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1985; 9: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, David et al., 2009David D.J. Samuels B.A. Rainer Q. Wang J.W. Marsteller D. Mendez I. Drew M. Craig D.A. Guiard B.P.

The test apparatus consists of a dark, safe compartment and an illuminated, aversive one. Three parameters were recorded: (1) latency to enter the lit compartment, (2) time spent in the lit compartment, and (3) the number of transitions between compartments. Ocn−/− mice displayed longer latency and spent less time in the lit compartment, two indexes of anxiety-related behavior (Figure 2A). They also made fewer transitions between compartments, an index of anxiety-like behavior and of motor-exploratory activity (Figure 2A).

Psychiatry. 2003; 54: 960-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), relies on the aversion of rodents to open spaces. The EPMT is comprised of two open and two enclosed arms. Testing takes place in bright ambient light conditions. Animals are placed onto the central area facing one closed arm and allowed to explore for 5 min. Anxiety-related behavior is defined in this test by a lesser proportion of time spent and fewer entries in the open arms. This is what was observed in Ocn−/− mice (Figure 2B). In the third test, the open-field test (OFT) (David et al., 2009David D.J. Samuels B.A. Rainer Q. Wang J.W. Marsteller D. Mendez I. Drew M. Craig D.A. Guiard B.P. Guilloux J.P. et al.Neurogenesis-dependent and -independent effects of fluoxetine in an animal model of anxiety/depression.Neuron. 2009; 62: 479-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), mice are placed in the center of the open-field box and video-tracked under normal light conditions for 30 min. Ocn−/− mice showed a drastic decrease in the distance moved, time spent in the center, and vertical activity compared to WT littermates, all features indicative of greater anxiety-like behavior and decreased exploratory activity (Figure 2C). Anxiety is often accompanied by depression. This was first assessed by the tail suspension test (TST) in which animals are subjected to the inescapable stress of being suspended by their tails (Cryan et al., 2005Cryan J.F. Mombereau C. Vassout A. The tail suspension test as a model for assessing antidepressant activity: review of pharmacological and genetic studies in mice.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2005; 29: 571-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, David et al., 2009David D.J. Samuels B.A. Rainer Q. Wang J.W. Marsteller D. Mendez I. Drew M. Craig D.A. Guiard B.P.

In this test, an index of helplessness is the time spent immobile. This time was significantly increased in Ocn−/− mice (Figure 2D). In the forced swim test (FST), mice are forced to swim over 6 min in a glass cylinder filled with water from which they cannot escape. Over time, mice cease their attempts to escape and float passively, an indication of a depression-like behavior. Ocn−/− mice spent 45% more time floating than WT mice (Figure 2E). Spatial learning and memory were assayed through the Morris water maze test (MWMT) that is thought to reflect functions of the hippocampus. This test relies on the ability of mice to use spatial cues to locate a submerged platform. Spatial learning is assessed through four trials a day for 10 to 12 days. Ocn−/− mice showed a nearly complete inability to learn over the course of 10 days (Figure 2F). Taken together, these tests showed that osteocalcin exerts a significant influence on anxiety, depression-like behaviors, learning, and memory. An electroretinogram did not detect any difference between Ocn−/− and WT mice, thus ruling out that these behavioral abnormalities were secondary to blindness (Figure S2A). Gprc6a−/− mice were indistinguishable from WT littermates for all these tests (Figures 2A–2E and 2G). Next we asked through a variety of approaches whether the molecular and behavioral abnormalities observed in Ocn−/− mice were indicative of a direct signaling of this hormone in the brain. We first tested whether osteocalcin crossed the BBB. For that purpose, we delivered subcutaneously vehicle or recombinant uncarboxylated, full-length, mouse osteocalcin (hereafter referred to as osteocalcin) in 3-month-old Ocn−/− mice. As a positive control, leptin, which crosses the BBB (Banks et al., 1996Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Huang W. Jaspan J.B. Maness L.M. Leptin enters the brain by a saturable system independent of insulin.Peptides. 1996; 17: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), was delivered in the same conditions in 3-month-old ob/ob mice. Seven days later, leptin and osteocalcin contents were measured in the blood and various parts of the brain of ob/ob and Ocn−/− mice, respectively. As expected, leptin was detected in the brainstem and hypothalamus of ob/ob mice (Yadav et al., 2009Yadav V.K. Oury F. Suda N. Liu Z.W. Gao X.B. Confavreux C. Klemenhagen K.C. Tanaka K.F.

In the conditions of this assay, the quantity of osteocalcin that accumulated in each location in the brains of Ocn−/− mice was similar to that observed in the brains of WT mice (Figures 3A and S3B). When using carboxylated, full-length mouse osteocalcin (hereafter referred to as carboxylated osteocalcin), significantly less accumulated in the brainstem and hypothalamus and none in the midbrain (Figure 3A).Figure 3Osteocalcin Binds to Neurons in the BrainShow full caption(A) Measurement of osteocalcin in bone, serum, cortex, midbrain, hypothalamus, and brainstem of Ocn−/− mice receiving either PBS (first column), uncarboxylated (second column), or carboxylated (third column) osteocalcin s.c. during 7 days.(B) Binding of GST-biotin (1.5 μg/ml) (panel 1) and biotinylated uncarboxylated osteocalcin (300 ng/ml) (panels 2–4) to the dorsal (DR) (first row) and median (MR) (second row) raphe nuclei of the brainstem (identified by anti-5-HT immunofluorescence), to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (third row) of the midbrain (identified by anti-TH immunofluorescence), and to the CA3 region (fourth row) of the hippocampus (identified anatomically).

Both genetic regulation of immune cell levels and their relationships with autoimmunity are largely undetermined. Here, we report genetic contributions to quantitative levels of 95 cell types encompassing 272 immune traits, in a cohort of 1,629 individuals from four clustered Sardinian villages. We first estimated trait heritability, showing that it can be substantial, accounting for up to 87% of the variance (mean 41%). Next, by assessing ∼8.2 million variants that we identified and confirmed in an extended set of 2,870 individuals, 23 independent variants at 13 loci associated with at least one trait. Notably, variants at three loci (HLA, IL2RA, and SH2B3/ATXN2) overlap with known autoimmune disease associations. These results connect specific cellular phenotypes to specific genetic variants, helping to explicate their involvement in disease."
https://openalex.org/W1996739007,"Mitochondrial fission, regulated by dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1), is a newly recognized determinant of mitochondrial function, but its contribution to left ventricular (LV) impairment following ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is unknown. We report that Drp1 activation during IR results in LV dysfunction and that Drp1 inhibition is beneficial. In both isolated neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and adult rat hearts (Langendorff preparation) mitochondrial fragmentation and swelling occurred within 30 min of IR. Drp1-S637 (serine 637) dephosphorylation resulted in Drp1 mitochondrial translocation and increased mitochondrial fission. The Drp1 inhibitor Mdivi-1 preserved mitochondrial morphology, reduced cytosolic calcium, and prevented cell death. Drp1 siRNA similarly preserved mitochondrial morphology. In Langendorff hearts, Mdivi-1 reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, improved LV developed pressure (92±5 vs. 28±10 mmHg, P<0.001), and lowered LV end diastolic pressure (10±1 vs. 86±13 mmHg, P<0.001) following IR. Mdivi-1 was protective if administered prior to or following ischemia. Because Drp1-S637 dephosphorylation is calcineurin sensitive, we assessed the effects of a calcineurin inhibitor, FK506. FK506 treatment prior to IR prevented Drp1-S637 dephosphorylation and preserved cardiac function. Likewise, therapeutic hypothermia (30°C) inhibited Drp1-S637 dephosphorylation and preserved mitochondrial morphology and myocardial function. Drp1 inhibition is a novel strategy to improve myocardial function following IR."
https://openalex.org/W1981102645,"Mitochondria are key organelles in the maintenance of cellular energy metabolism and integrity. Here, we show that mitochondria number decrease but their size increase in orexigenic agouti-related protein (Agrp) neurons during the transition from fasted to fed to overfed state. These fusion-like dynamic changes were cell-type specific, as they occurred in the opposite direction in anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Interfering with mitochondrial fusion mechanisms in Agrp neurons by cell-selectively knocking down mitofusin 1 (Mfn1) or mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) resulted in altered mitochondria size and density in these cells. Deficiency in mitofusins impaired the electric activity of Agrp neurons during high-fat diet (HFD), an event reversed by cell-selective administration of ATP. Agrp-specific Mfn1 or Mfn2 knockout mice gained less weight when fed a HFD due to decreased fat mass. Overall, our data unmask an important role for mitochondrial dynamics governed by Mfn1 and Mfn2 in Agrp neurons in central regulation of whole-body energy metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2099188975,"Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates gene expression during lineage specification through trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). In Drosophila, polycomb binding sites are dynamic chromatin regions enriched with the histone variant H3.3. Here, we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), H3.3 is required for proper establishment of H3K27me3 at the promoters of developmentally regulated genes. Upon H3.3 depletion, these promoters show reduced nucleosome turnover measured by deposition of de novo synthesized histones and reduced PRC2 occupancy. Further, we show H3.3-dependent interaction of PRC2 with the histone chaperone, Hira, and that Hira localization to chromatin requires H3.3. Our data demonstrate the importance of H3.3 in maintaining a chromatin landscape in ESCs that is important for proper gene regulation during differentiation. Moreover, our findings support the emerging notion that H3.3 has multiple functions in distinct genomic locations that are not always correlated with an ""active"" chromatin state."
https://openalex.org/W2141897899,"Understanding how to recover fully functional and transcriptionally active chromatin when its integrity has been challenged by genotoxic stress is a critical issue. Here, by investigating how chromatin dynamics regulate transcriptional activity in response to DNA damage in human cells, we identify a pathway involving the histone chaperone histone regulator A (HIRA) to promote transcription restart after UVC damage. Our mechanistic studies reveal that HIRA accumulates at sites of UVC irradiation upon detection of DNA damage prior to repair and deposits newly synthesized H3.3 histones. This local action of HIRA depends on ubiquitylation events associated with damage recognition. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the early and transient function of HIRA in response to DNA damage primes chromatin for later reactivation of transcription. We propose that HIRA-dependent histone deposition serves as a chromatin bookmarking system to facilitate transcription recovery after genotoxic stress."

When ectopically expressed in a cancer cell line, this variant promotes transformation. Epigenetic dysregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancers. We developed a high-information-content mass spectrometry approach to profile global histone modifications in human cancers. When applied to 115 lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia1, this approach identified distinct molecular chromatin signatures. One signature was characterized by increased histone 3 lysine 36 (H3K36) dimethylation, exhibited by several lines harboring translocations in NSD2, which encodes a methyltransferase. A previously unknown NSD2 p.Glu1099Lys (p.E1099K) variant was identified in nontranslocated acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines sharing this signature. Ectopic expression of the variant induced a chromatin signature characteristic of NSD2 hyperactivation and promoted transformation. NSD2 knockdown selectively inhibited the proliferation of NSD2-mutant lines and impaired the in vivo growth of an NSD2-mutant ALL xenograft. Sequencing analysis of >1,000 pediatric cancer genomes identified the NSD2 p.E1099K alteration in 14% of t(12;21) ETV6-RUNX1–containing ALLs. These findings identify NSD2 as a potential therapeutic target for pediatric ALL and provide a general framework for the functional annotation of cancer epigenomes."
https://openalex.org/W1997427906,"The importance of maternal folate consumption for normal development is well established, yet the molecular mechanism linking folate metabolism to development remains poorly understood. The enzyme methionine synthase reductase (Mtrr) is necessary for utilization of methyl groups from the folate cycle. We found that a hypomorphic mutation of the mouse Mtrr gene results in intrauterine growth restriction, developmental delay, and congenital malformations, including neural tube, heart, and placental defects. Importantly, these defects were dependent upon the Mtrr genotypes of the maternal grandparents. Furthermore, we observed widespread epigenetic instability associated with altered gene expression in the placentas of wild-type grandprogeny of Mtrr-deficient maternal grandparents. Embryo transfer experiments revealed that Mtrr deficiency in mice lead to two distinct, separable phenotypes: adverse effects on their wild-type daughters' uterine environment, leading to growth defects in wild-type grandprogeny, and the appearance of congenital malformations independent of maternal environment that persist for five generations, likely through transgenerational epigenetic inheritance."

Using genome-wide association results, we demonstrate that common variants associated with complex diseases are enriched in the genes indicated by this ""Mendelian code."" Finally, we detect hundreds of comorbidity associations among Mendelian disorders, and we use probabilistic genetic modeling to demonstrate that Mendelian variants likely contribute nonadditively to the risk for a subset of complex diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1974979950,"Sirtuins, a family of histone deacetylases, have a fiercely debated role in regulating lifespan. In contrast with recent observations, here we find that overexpression of sir-2.1, the ortholog of mammalian SirT1, does extend Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Sirtuins mandatorily convert NAD(+) into nicotinamide (NAM). We here find that NAM and its metabolite, 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA), extend C. elegans lifespan, even in the absence of sir-2.1. We identify a previously unknown C. elegans nicotinamide-N-methyltransferase, encoded by a gene now named anmt-1, to generate MNA from NAM. Disruption and overexpression of anmt-1 have opposing effects on lifespan independent of sirtuins, with loss of anmt-1 fully inhibiting sir-2.1-mediated lifespan extension. MNA serves as a substrate for a newly identified aldehyde oxidase, GAD-3, to generate hydrogen peroxide, which acts as a mitohormetic reactive oxygen species signal to promote C. elegans longevity. Taken together, sirtuin-mediated lifespan extension depends on methylation of NAM, providing an unexpected mechanistic role for sirtuins beyond histone deacetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2040203747,"In a new study, Yingzi Yang and her colleagues show that a careful balance between Wnt and Hedgehog signaling is required to maintain proper differentiation of osteogenic precursor cells. Upon mutation of GNAS, this balance is disturbed and severe bone disease develops, including either heterotopic ossification or fibrous dysplasia. Heterotopic ossification, the pathologic formation of extraskeletal bone, occurs as a common complication of trauma or in genetic disorders and can be disabling and lethal. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that Gαs restricts bone formation to the skeleton by inhibiting Hedgehog signaling in mesenchymal progenitor cells. In progressive osseous heteroplasia, a human disease caused by null mutations in GNAS, which encodes Gαs, Hedgehog signaling is upregulated in ectopic osteoblasts and progenitor cells. In animal models, we show that genetically-mediated ectopic Hedgehog signaling is sufficient to induce heterotopic ossification, whereas inhibition of this signaling pathway by genetic or pharmacological means strongly reduces the severity of this condition. As our previous work has shown that GNAS gain-of-function mutations upregulate WNT–β-catenin signaling in osteoblast progenitor cells, resulting in their defective differentiation and fibrous dysplasia, we identify Gαs as a key regulator of proper osteoblast differentiation through its maintenance of a balance between the Wnt–β-catenin and Hedgehog pathways. Also, given the results here of the pharmacological studies in our mouse model, we propose that Hedgehog inhibitors currently used in the clinic for other conditions, such as cancer, may possibly be repurposed for treating heterotopic ossification and other diseases caused by GNAS inactivation."

Here, we show that activation of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in aorta-gonad-mesonephros-derived HE ex vivo dramatically enhanced its HSC potential, whereas conditional inactivation of the RA metabolizing enzyme retinal dehydrogenase 2 in VE-cadherin expressing endothelial cells in vivo abrogated HSC development. Wnt signaling completely blocked the HSC inductive effects of RA modulators, whereas inhibition of the pathway promoted the development of HSCs in the absence of RA signaling. Collectively, these findings position RA and Wnt signaling as key regulators of HSC development and in doing so provide molecular insights that will aid in developing strategies for their generation from pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2115553685,"Infections disturb metabolic homeostasis in many contexts, but the underlying connections are not completely understood. To address this, we use paired genetic and computational screens in Drosophila to identify transcriptional regulators of immunity and pathology and their associated target genes and physiologies. We show that Mef2 is required in the fat body for anabolic function and the immune response. Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we find that MEF2 is phosphorylated at a conserved site in healthy flies and promotes expression of lipogenic and glycogenic enzymes. Upon infection, this phosphorylation is lost, and the activity of MEF2 changes--MEF2 now associates with the TATA binding protein to bind a distinct TATA box sequence and promote antimicrobial peptide expression. The loss of phosphorylated MEF2 contributes to loss of anabolic enzyme expression in Gram-negative bacterial infection. MEF2 is thus a critical transcriptional switch in the adult fat body between metabolism and immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2069043023,"The de novo DNA methyltransferase 3-like (Dnmt3L) is a catalytically inactive DNA methyltransferase that cooperates with Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to methylate DNA. Dnmt3L is highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), but its function in these cells is unknown. Through genome-wide analysis of Dnmt3L knockdown in ESCs, we found that Dnmt3L is a positive regulator of methylation at the gene bodies of housekeeping genes and, more surprisingly, is also a negative regulator of methylation at promoters of bivalent genes. Dnmt3L is required for the differentiation of ESCs into primordial germ cells (PGCs) through the activation of the homeotic gene Rhox5. We demonstrate that Dnmt3L interacts with the Polycomb PRC2 complex in competition with the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b to maintain low methylation levels at the H3K27me3 regions. Thus, in ESCs, Dnmt3L counteracts the activity of de novo DNA methylases to maintain hypomethylation at promoters of bivalent developmental genes."
https://openalex.org/W1978719878,"Macrophage-mediated inflammation is a major contributor to obesity-associated insulin resistance. The corepressor NCoR interacts with inflammatory pathway genes in macrophages, suggesting that its removal would result in increased activity of inflammatory responses. Surprisingly, we find that macrophage-specific deletion of NCoR instead results in an anti-inflammatory phenotype along with robust systemic insulin sensitization in obese mice. We present evidence that derepression of LXRs contributes to this paradoxical anti-inflammatory phenotype by causing increased expression of genes that direct biosynthesis of palmitoleic acid and ω3 fatty acids. Remarkably, the increased ω3 fatty acid levels primarily inhibit NF-κB-dependent inflammatory responses by uncoupling NF-κB binding and enhancer/promoter histone acetylation from subsequent steps required for proinflammatory gene activation. This provides a mechanism for the in vivo anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitive phenotype observed in mice with macrophage-specific deletion of NCoR. Therapeutic methods to harness this mechanism could lead to a new approach to insulin-sensitizing therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2060776420,"In glioblastoma, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is frequently activated by loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). However, it is not known whether inhibiting PI3K represents a selective and effective approach for treatment. We interrogated large databases and found that sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is activated in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma. We demonstrate that the SHH and PI3K pathways synergize to promote tumor growth and viability in human PTEN-deficient glioblastomas. A combination of PI3K and SHH signaling inhibitors not only suppressed the activation of both pathways but also abrogated S6 kinase (S6K) signaling. Accordingly, targeting both pathways simultaneously resulted in mitotic catastrophe and tumor apoptosis and markedly reduced the growth of PTEN-deficient glioblastomas in vitro and in vivo. The drugs tested here appear to be safe in humans; therefore, this combination may provide a new targeted treatment for glioblastoma."

To address this, we used a reinforcement learning paradigm to independently manipulate both spectral and temporal features of birdsong, a complex learned motor sequence, while recording and perturbing activity in underlying circuits. Our results uncovered a striking dissociation in how neural circuits underlie learning in the two domains. The basal ganglia was required for modifying spectral, but not temporal, structure. This functional dissociation extended to the descending motor pathway, where recordings from a premotor cortex analog nucleus reflected changes to temporal, but not spectral, structure. Our results reveal a strategy in which the nervous system employs different and largely independent circuits to learn distinct aspects of a motor skill."
https://openalex.org/W2039403738,"Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is emerging as a critical factor in understanding prostate cancer biology. Although reduced in prostate cancer above Gleason grade 3, ERβ is a potential drug target at the initial stage of the disease. In human prostate cancer cells, we found that ERβ causes apoptosis by increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic factor p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), independent of p53, but dependent on the forkhead transcription factor class-O family member, FOXO3a. FOXO3a has previously been shown to induce PUMA after growth factor withdrawal and inhibition of the Akt pathway. Surprisingly, the phosphorylation of FOXO3a remained unchanged, while the mRNA and total protein levels of FOXO3a were increased in response to ERβ expression or treatment of PC3, 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells with the ERβ-specific ligands 3β-Adiol (5α-androstane-3β,17β-diol), DPN (diarylpropionitrile) or 8β-VE2 (8-vinylestra-1,3,5 (10)-triene-3,17β-diol). Knockdown of FOXO3a or ERβ expression abolished the increase of PUMA in response to 3β-Adiol in LNCaP and PC3 cells, suggesting that FOXO3a mediates the apoptotic effect of 3β-Adiol-activated ERβ. Moreover, the ventral prostate of ERβ-/- mice had decreased expression of FOXO3a and PUMA compared with the ERβ+/+ mice, indicating a relationship between ERβ and FOXO3a expression. The regulation of FOXO3a by ERβ in normal basal epithelial cells indicates a function of ERβ in cell differentiation and maintenance of cells in a quiescent state. In addition, the expression of ERβ, FOXO3a and PUMA is comparable and higher in benign prostatic hyperplasia than in prostate cancer Gleason grade 4 or higher, where there is substantial loss of ERβ, FOXO3a and PUMA. We conclude that ERβ induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by increasing transcription of FOXO3a, leading to an increase of PUMA and subsequent triggering of apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway involving caspase-9. Furthermore, we conclude that ligands specifically activating ERβ could be useful pharmaceuticals in the treatment of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1980239925,"The cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancer and correlated with a poor prognosis. Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of CTSB attenuates tumor growth, invasion and metastasis in mouse models of human cancers. CTSB is expressed in both cancer cells and cells of the tumor stroma, in particular in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). In order to evaluate the impact of tumor- or stromal cell-derived CTSB on Polyoma Middle T (PyMT)-induced breast cancer progression, we used in vivo and in vitro approaches to induce human CTSB overexpression in PyMT cancer cells or stromal cells alone or in combination. Orthotopic transplantation experiments revealed that CTSB overexpression in cancer cells rather than in the stroma affects PyMT tumor progression. In 3D cultures, primary PyMT tumor cells showed higher extracellular matrix proteolysis and enhanced collective cell invasion when CTSB was overexpressed and proteolytically active. Coculture of PyMT cells with bone marrow-derived macrophages induced a TAM-like macrophage phenotype in vitro, and the presence of such M2-polarized macrophages in 3D cultures enhanced sprouting of tumor spheroids. We employed a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible CTSB expression system to selectively overexpress human CTSB either in cancer cells or in macrophages in 3D cocultures. Tumor spheroid invasiveness was only enhanced when CTSB was overexpressed in cancer cells, whereas CTSB expression in macrophages alone did not further promote invasiveness of tumor spheroids. We conclude that CTSB overexpression in the PyMT mouse model promotes tumor progression not by a stromal effect, but by a direct, cancer cell-inherent mode of action: CTSB overexpression renders the PyMT cancers more invasive by increasing proteolytic extracellular matrix protein degradation fostering collective cell invasion into adjacent tissue."

Here we assessed the role of ESRP1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using anti-ESRP1, FGFR-2 IIIb and FGFR-2 IIIc antibodies in 123 PDAC cases. ESRP1 expression vector and small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting ESRP1 were transfected into human PDAC cells, and cell growth, migration and invasion were analyzed. In vivo heterotopic and orthotopic implantations using ESRP1 overexpression clones were performed and effects on pancreatic tumor volumes and hepatic and pulmonary metastases determined. ESRP1 immunoreactivity was strong in the nuclei of cancer cells in well-to-moderately differentiated PDACs but weak in poorly differentiated cancers. Well-to-moderately differentiated cancers also exhibited high FGFR-2 IIIb and low FGFR-2 IIIc expression, whereas this ratio was reversed in the poorly differentiated cancers. Increased ESRP1 expression was associated with longer survival in comparison with low ESRP1 expression, and PANC-1 cells engineered to express ESRP1 exhibited increased FGFR-2 IIIb expression and decreased migration and invasion in vitro, whereas ESRP1 siRNA-transfected KLM-1 cells exhibited increased FGFR-2 IIIc expression and increased cell growth, migration and invasion. In vivo, ESRP1-overexpressing clones formed significantly fewer liver metastases as compared with control clones. ESRP1 regulates the expression pattern of FGFR-2 isoforms, attenuates cell growth, migration, invasion and metastasis, and is a favorable prognostic factor in PDAC. Therefore, devising mechanisms to upregulate ESRP1 may exert a beneficial therapeutic effect in PDAC."

It does not take much perspicacity to see that what really makes this difference is not the tall hat and the umbrella, but the wealth and nourishment of which they are evidence, and that a gold watch or membership of a club in Pall Mall might be proved in the same way to have the like sovereign virtues….George Bernard Shaw, The Doctor’s Dilemma (Preface), 1909 Distinguishing correlation from causality is the essence of experimental science. Nowhere is the need for this distinction greater today than in complex disease genetics, where proof that specific genes have causal effects on human disease phenotypes remains an enormous burden and challenge. Given the potential scientific and medical payoffs of disease gene discovery (Chakravarti, 2001Chakravarti A. To a future of genetic medicine.Nature. 2001; 409: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we argue in this Essay of the need for a rigorous examination of the assumptions under which we connect genes to phenotypes. This is particularly so in this age of routine -omic surveys, which can produce more false-positive than true-positive findings (Kohane et al., 2006Kohane I.S. Masys D.R. Altman R.B. The incidentalome: a threat to genomic medicine.JAMA. 2006; 296: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Moreover, genomic mapping and sequencing approaches that are invaluable for producing a list of unbiased candidates are, by themselves, insufficient for implicating specific gene(s) in a disease or biological process. Consequently, we suggest that specific genetic criteria, analogous to Koch’s postulates in microbiology, need to be satisfied in order to promote the role of one or more genes as being “causal,” rather than just “associated,” in a disease process (Brown and Goldstein, 1992Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Koch’s postulates for cholesterol.Cell. 1992; 71: 187-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, Falkow, 1988Falkow S.

Below we discuss the nature of the “proof” that we desire in order to make fundamental discoveries in human pathophysiology. We admit at the outset that the answers are not straightforward, and that there are serious technical and intellectual impediments to demonstrating causality for the common complex disorders of man where multiple interacting genes are involved. We acknowledge that even unproven candidate genes may lead to significant insight into disease pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the casual conflation of “mapped locus” to “proven gene” is a constant source of confusion and obfuscation in biology and medicine that requires remedy. We hope to offer some concrete suggestions, however difficult they may be to satisfy, because incorrect knowledge is worse than no knowledge at all (Brown and Goldstein, 1992Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Koch’s postulates for cholesterol.Cell. 1992; 71: 187-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consider that two types of genomic surveys, one horizontal and the other vertical, are now routine for attempting to understand human biology and disease. In horizontal or broad surveys, we can obtain the full genome sequence in tens to hundreds of thousands of individuals to sort out which genomic segments are important and which are innocent bystanders, to a particular comparison between individuals, such as those with versus without coronary artery disease or cases with early versus late onset of dementia. In contrast, in vertical or deep surveys, we examine the effects of the genome as the DNA information gets processed, and its encoded functions get executed through its transcriptome, proteome, and effectors such as the metabolome. Both of these classes of studies are relevant to analysis of a disease of unknown etiology and have re-emphasized the long-held suspicion that studying genes one-at-a-time may not be meaningful because a gene’s effect is usually pleiotropic, context dependent, and contingent upon the state of many other genetic and nongenetic factors (Chin et al., 2012Chin B.L. Ryan O. Lewitter F. Boone C. Fink G.R. Genetic variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: circuit diversification in a signal transduction network.Genetics. 2012; 192: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In turn, this implies that proving a gene’s specific role in a biological process, either in wild-type or mutant form, may not be straightforward because its role may only be evident when examined in relation to its biochemical partners, and in particular contexts of diet, pathogen exposure, etc. (Zerba et al., 1996Zerba K.E. Ferrell R.E. Sing C.F. Genotype-environment interaction: apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene effects and age as an index of time and spatial context in the human.Genetics. 1996; 143: 463-478PubMed Google Scholar). This is a particular problem in genetic studies of any outbred nonexperimental organism, such as the human, and studies of human disease, where investigations are observational not experimental. It is the strong belief of contemporary human geneticists that uncovering the genetic underpinnings of any disease, however complex, is the surest unbiased route to understanding its pathophysiology and, thus, enabling its future rational therapies (Brooke et al., 2008Brooke B.S. Habashi J.P. Judge D.P. Patel N. Loeys B. Dietz 3rd, H.C. Angiotensin II blockade and aortic-root dilation in Marfan’s syndrome.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 358: 2787-2795Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Consequently, for this view to prevail, we should require experimental evidence, be it in cells, tissues, experimental models, or the rare patient, for the role of a specific gene in a disease process. We discuss here the types of evidence that we consider incontrovertible. Success in this difficult task requires us to solve a logical conundrum: how can we understand the genes underlying a phenotype if some of these component factors, in isolation, do not have recognizable phenotypes on their own? We know that even in a simple model organism, budding yeast, synthetic lethality—where death or some other phenotype occurs only through the conspiracy of mutations at two different genes—is widely prevalent (Costanzo et al., 2010Costanzo M. Baryshnikova A. Bellay J. Kim Y. Spear E.D. Sevier C.S. Ding H. Koh J.L. Toufighi K. Mostafavi S. et al.The genetic landscape of a cell.Science. 2010; 327: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Interactions of greater complexity and involving more than two genes are also known in yeast (Hartman et al., 2001Hartman 4th, J.L. Garvik B. Hartwell L. Principles for the buffering of genetic variation.Science. 2001; 291: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) and must be true for humans as well. A human genome will typically harbor 20 genes that are fully inactivated, without any overt disease phenotype, presumably due to the buffering by other genes (MacArthur et al., 2012MacArthur D.G. Balasubramanian S. Frankish A. Huang N. Morris J. Walter K. Jostins L. Habegger L. Pickrell J.K. Montgomery S.B. et al.1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumA systematic survey of loss-of-function variants in human protein-coding genes.Science. 2012; 335: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Acknowledging this complexity, there are two general ways forward. First, at this stage of our knowledge, perhaps we should not worry about “all” of the genes in a disease, in many ways an undefinable goal, but rather those whose effects are demonstrable, i.e., through a mutation that, irrespective of its interactions, can by itself affect a critical pathway. Second, as we unravel the effects of multiple genes on a phenotype, we should advance the same criterion, namely, that a set of mutations affects that same critical process. Both of these goals are approachable, particularly with recent advances in genome-editing technologies that allow the creation of multiple mutations within a single experimental organism (Wang et al., 2013Wang H. Yang H. Shivalila C.S. Dawlaty M.M. Cheng A.W. Zhang F. Jaenisch R. One-step generation of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome engineering.Cell. 2013; 153: 910-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). The question then is how “complex” are complex traits and diseases? With the rediscovery of Mendel’s rules of transmission more than 100 years ago, there was a vicious debate on the relative importance of single-gene versus multifactorial inheritance (Provine, 1971Provine W.B. The Origins of Theoretical Population Genetics. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago1971Google Scholar). Geneticists quickly, and successfully, focused on deciphering the specific mechanisms of gene inheritance and understanding the physiology of the gene in lieu of answering why some phenotypes had complex etiology and transmission. Nevertheless, the rare examples of deciphering the genetic basis of complex phenotypes, such as for truncate (wing) in Drosophila (Altenburg and Muller, 1920Altenburg E. Muller H.J. The genetic basis of truncate wing,-an inconstant and modifiable character in Drosophila.Genetics. 1920; 5: 1-59PubMed Google Scholar), clearly emphasized that traits were more than the additive properties of multiple genes. Today, it is quite clear that Mendelian inheritance of traits, including diseases, is the exception not the rule. Nevertheless, the entire language of genetics is in terms of individual genes for individual phenotypes, with one function, rather than the ensemble and emergent properties of genomes. This absence of a specific genetics language for the proper description of the multigenic architecture of traits (the ensemble) remains as an impediment to our understanding of the nature and degree of genetic complexity of the phenotype. The case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating, progressive motor neuron disease, illustrates this point (Ludolph et al., 2012Ludolph A.C. Brettschneider J. Weishaupt J.H. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2012; 25: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of evidence, we largely describe ALS as being “heterogeneous” and comprised of single-gene mutations that can individually lead to disease. In 1993, mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were identified in an autosomal-dominant form of the disease; subsequently, the disorder has become synonymous with aberrant clearance of free radicals as its central pathology. What is often not appreciated, however, is that fewer than 10% of all cases of ALS are familial and even fewer follow an apparent Mendelian pattern. Even within this subset of cases, more than 20 distinct genes, spanning other pathways including RNA homeostasis, have been identified, and SOD1 represents a minority of cases. The molecular etiology for the majority of the sporadic forms of the disease remains unclear, and the scientific problem in understanding ALS is more than simply identification of additional genes. We may ask, can SOD1 and the other described gene mutations lead to ALS by themselves? Are these the key rate-limiting steps to ALS or simply one of several required in concert? Is the aberrant clearance of free radicals the fundamental defect or one of many such pathologies or a common downstream consequence? Given the diversity and number of deleterious, even loss-of-function, genetic variants in all of our genomes (Abecasis et al., 2012Abecasis G.R. Auton A. Brooks L.D. DePristo M.A. Durbin R.M. Handsaker R.E. Kang H.M. Marth G.T. McVean G.A. 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes.Nature. 2012; 491: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5691) Google Scholar, MacArthur et al., 2012MacArthur D.G. Balasubramanian S. Frankish A. Huang N. Morris J. Walter K. Jostins L. Habegger L. Pickrell J.K.

No doubt, this plurality is the case for cancer (Vogelstein et al., 2013Vogelstein B. Papadopoulos N. Velculescu V.E. Zhou S. Diaz Jr., L.A. Kinzler K.W. Cancer genome landscapes.Science. 2013; 339: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (5232) Google Scholar), Crohn’s disease (Jostins et al., 2012Jostins L. Ripke S. Weersma R.K. Duerr R.H. McGovern D.P. Hui K.Y. Lee J.C. Schumm L.P. Sharma Y. Anderson C.A. et al.International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC)Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2012; 491: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar), and even rare developmental disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (McCallion et al., 2003McCallion A.S. Emison E.S. Kashuk C.S. Bush R.T. Kenton M. Carrasquillo M.M. Jones K.W. Kennedy G.C. Portnoy M.E. Green E.D. Chakravarti A. Genomic variation in multigenic traits: Hirschsprung disease.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2003; 68: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In all of these cases, a richer genetics vocabulary may improve our understanding of the phenotypes through recognizing what we know and what we don’t; our current language limits us to describing genes not phenotypes. Molecular biology, genetics’ twin, on the other hand, appears to have been far more successful in deciphering and describing not only its individual components (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein) but also their mutual relationships (e.g., DNA-protein interaction) and ensembles (e.g., transcriptional complex), although this is also far from complete (Watson et al., 2007Watson J.D. Baker T.A. Bell S.P. Gann A. Levine M. Losick R. Molecular Biology of the Gene.Seventh Edition. CSHL Press & Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco2007Google Scholar). Not only do we understand the structure of individual genes and how their molecular functions get executed, but we are also starting to learn how functions get regulated through a diversity of cis- and trans-acting functions. The consequences of the primary and interaction effects are often well understood, even though not completely described, at both the molecular and cellular levels (Alberts et al., 2007Alberts B. Johnson A. Lewis J. Raff M. Robert K. Walter P. Molecular Biology of the Cell.Fifth Edition. Garland Science, New York2007Crossref Google Scholar). There are also improving technologies and understanding of the structures and functions of ensembles of proteins and cells, and how these interact and communicate with one another to create complexity (Ilsley et al., 2013Ilsley G.R. Fisher J. Apweiler R. Depace A.H. Luscombe N.M. Cellular resolution models for even skipped regulation in the entire Drosophila embryo.Elife. 2013; 2: e00522Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the use of genetic tools and genetic perspectives are fundamental to this progress, these advances have not as yet led to a major revision of our understanding of trait or disease variation. The major reason for this discrepancy is that, with few exceptions (Raj et al., 2010Raj A. Rifkin S.A. Andersen E. van Oudenaarden A. Variability in gene expression underlies incomplete penetrance.Nature. 2010; 463: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), molecular and cell biology has focused on the impact of deleting or overexpressing genes and not grappled with the consequences of allelic variation. Classical Mendelian genetics has been a boon to uncovering biology from yeast to humans whenever a mutation with a simple inheritance pattern can be isolated. This approach has been revolutionary in the unicellular yeast, particularly because genetics (and gene manipulation), biochemistry, and cell biology were melded to understand function at a variety of levels. This kind of multilevel approach has been less straightforward, but still largely successful, for a metazoan such as Drosophila where more genes and multiple specialized cells often rescue the effects of a mutation or enhance its minor effect. These lessons suggest to us that the current approach, based strictly on genetic variation, to understanding complex human disease is also grossly insufficient and, as in yeast and flies, will require the contemporaneous analysis of the molecular biology, biochemistry, and physiology of the genes within a mapped locus to even identify the disease gene, let alone understand its functions. Success in this endeavor will require a synthesis of many biological disciplines that includes the role of genetic variation as intrinsic to the biological process, not an aspect to be ignored. Consequently, melding variation-based genetic and molecular biological thinking is of critical importance for both fields and is central to our understanding of mechanisms of trait variation, including interindividual variation in disease risk. If most disease, in most humans, is the consequence of the effects of variation at many genes, then knowledge of their functional relationships, rather than merely their identities, is central to understanding the phenotype. This is clearly a problem of “Systems Biology” but one that incorporates genetic variation directly. The ability to integrate the realities of such widespread genetic variation, which are ultimately at the causal root of disease mechanisms, with systems biology approaches to understand functional contingencies is central to the challenge of deciphering complex human disease. Importantly, it is likely to spur new thinking in both fields. Genetic transmission rules imply that, even in an intractable species such as us, one can map genomic segments that must contain a disease or trait gene. The lure and success of this method is that we can map a disease locus in the absence of any knowledge of the underlying biology of the phenotype. Such mapping requires identification of the segregation of common sites of variation across the genome, now easy to identify through sequencing, and recognition of a genomic segment identical-by-descent in affected individuals, both within and between families. This task has become easier and more powerful as sequencing technology has improved to provide a nearly complete catalog of variants above 1% frequency in the population; further improvements to sample rarer variants are ongoing (Abecasis et al., 2012Abecasis G.R. Auton A. Brooks L.D. DePristo M.A. Durbin R.M. Handsaker R.E. Kang H.M. Marth G.T. McVean G.A. 1000 Genomes Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes.Nature. 2012; 491: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5691) Google Scholar). Consequently, genetic mapping, once the province of rare Mendelian disorders, is now applicable to any human trait or disease. In fact, more than 2,000 confirmed loci, each containing multiple genes, affecting susceptibility to more than 100 medically relevant traits (e.g., blood pressure) and disease (e.g., hypertension) are now known (Hindorff et al., 2009Hindorff L.A. Sethupathy P. Junkins H.A. Ramos E.M. Mehta J.P. Collins F.S. Manolio T.A. Potential etiologic and functional implications of genome-wide association loci for human diseases and traits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 9362-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (3058) Google Scholar). For most complex traits examined, many such loci have been mapped, but the vast majority of the specific genes remain unidentified. We can sometimes guess at a candidate gene within the locus (Jostins et al., 2012Jostins L. Ripke S. Weersma R.K. Duerr R.H. McGovern D.P. Hui K.Y. Lee J.C. Schumm L.P. Sharma Y. Anderson C.A. et al.International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC)Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2012; 491: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar), sometimes implicate a gene by virtue of an abundance of rare variants among affected individuals (Jostins et al., 2012Jostins L. Ripke S. Weersma R.K. Duerr R.H. McGovern D.P. Hui K.Y. Lee J.C. Schumm L.P. Sharma Y. Anderson C.A. et al.International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC)Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2012; 491: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar), in rare circumstances, use therapeutic modulation of a pathway to pinpoint the gene (Moon et al., 2004Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. WNT and beta-catenin signalling: diseases and therapies.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), and sometimes identify one by painstaking experimental dissection (Musunuru et al., 2010Musunuru K. Strong A. Frank-Kamenetsky M. Lee N.E. Ahfeldt T. Sachs K.V. Li X. Li H. Kuperwasser N. Ruda V.M. et al.From noncoding variant to phenotype via SORT1 at the 1p13 cholesterol locus.Nature. 2010; 466: 714-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar), but, generally, identification of the underlying gene has not become easier. In fact, most of the mapped loci underlying complex traits remain unresolved at the gene or mechanistic level. Despite the beginning clues to human disease pathophysiology that complex disease mapping is providing, and the slow identification of individual genes, it appears highly unlikely that we can understand traits and diseases this way. There is indeed evidence for scenarios in which variation in complex traits, including risk of complex disease, is mediated by a myriad of variants of minute effect, spread evenly across the genome (Yang et al., 2011Yang J. Manolio T.A. Pasquale L.R. Boerwinkle E. Caporaso N. Cunningham J.M. de Andrade M. Feenstra B. Feingold E. Hayes M.G. et al.Genome partitioning of genetic variation for complex traits using common SNPs.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Therefore, we need other approaches to override this bottleneck. For Mendelian disorders, gene identification within a locus is made possible by each mutation being necessary and sufficient for the phenotype, being functionally deleterious and rare, and having an inheritance pattern consistent with the phenotype. It’s the mutation that eventually reveals the biology and explains the phenotype. Any component locus for a complex disease has no such restriction, as the causal variants are neither necessary nor sufficient, nor coding (in fact, they are frequently noncoding and regulatory) nor rare (Emison et al., 2010Emison E.S. Garcia-Barcelo M. Grice E.A. Lantieri F. Amiel J. Burzynski G. Fernandez R.M. Hao L. Kashuk C. West K. et al.Differential contributions of rare and common, coding and noncoding Ret mutations to multifactorial Hirschsprung disease liability.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 87: 60-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, Jostins et al., 2012Jostins L. Ripke S. Weersma R.K. Duerr R.H. McGovern D.P. Hui K.Y. Lee J.C. Schumm L.P. Sharma Y. Anderson C.A. et al.International IBD Genetics Consortium (IIBDGC)Host-microbe interactions have shaped the genetic architecture of inflammatory bowel disease.Nature. 2012; 491: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar). Currently, the major attempts to overcome this impediment involve reliance on single severe mutations at the very same component genes and demonstrating Mendelian inheritance of the same or similar phenotype, and/or identifying single genes with a demonstrable excess of rare coding variants. The first of these two strategies is a strong unproven hypothesis and probably not universally true, whereas the second relies on very large sample sizes of patients and suffers from the unknown functional effect of the majority of rare coding variants. Consequently, these strategies themselves depend on the hidden biology we seek and are applicable only to the most common human diseases. It appears to us that ignorance of biology has become rate limiting for understanding disease pathophysiology, except perhaps for the Mendelian disorders. There are two ways to get out of this vicious cycle (Figure 1). One approach may be to use a set of model traits and diseases and employ their existing mapped loci to identify a small set of the component genes by brute-force (or, luck) and use the uncovered biology to infer which other genes in their “pathways” can explain the disease. This approach has been highly profitable in Crohn’s disease—a common inflammatory disorder whose root causes remained cryptic until genome-wide association studies identified a large number of loci with fundamental defects in mucosal immunity (Graham and Xavier, 2013Graham D.B. Xavier R.J. From genetics of inflammatory bowel disease towards mechanistic insights.Trends Immunol. 2013; 34: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)—but not in type 2 diabetes, where the pathophysiology awaits clarification (Groop and Pociot, 2013Groop L. Pociot F. Genetics of diabetes - Are we missing the genes or the disease?.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2013; Google Scholar). Although we suspect that the numbers of pathways involved are fewer than the numbers of genes involved, this is merely suspicion. Nevertheless, can we reduce the complexity of the problem by identifying all of the relevant pathways? Despite uncertainty, this approach has the advantage of leading to specific testable hypotheses. The second approach is to focus research on why the disease is complex in the first place. Although the genome is linear, its expression and biology are highly nonlinear and hierarchical, being sequestered in specific cells and organelles (Ilsley et al., 2013Ilsley G.R. Fisher J. Apweiler R. Depace A.H. Luscombe N.M. Cellular resolution models for even skipped regulation in the entire Drosophila embryo.Elife. 2013; 2: e00522Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Understanding this hierarchy, the province of systems biology, is critical to the solution of the complex inheritance problem (Yosef et al., 2013Yosef N. Shalek A.K. Gaublomme J.T. Jin H. Lee Y. Awasthi A. Wu C. Karwacz K. Xiao S. Jorgolli M. et al.Dynamic regulatory network controlling TH17 cell differentiation.Nature. 2013; 496: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Even more importantly, this approach might, through the effect of mutations, allow us to decipher cell circuitry and understand which pathways are limiting and which are redundant. This last aspect is critical: as we argue below, with our current state of knowledge, we are likely to have our greatest success with understanding how genes map onto pathways, and how pathways map onto disease, before a true quantitative understanding of disease biology emerges. One might counter that existing gene ontologies do precisely that, but, even in yeast, this appears to be highly incomplete (Dutkowski et al., 2013Dutkowski J. Kramer M. Surma M.A. Balakrishnan R. Cherry J.M. Krogan N.J. Ideker T. A gene ontology inferred from molecular networks.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The evidence that a specific gene is involved in a particular human disease has historically been nonstatistical and based on our experience with identifying mutations in Mendel"

https://openalex.org/W1971654797,"Hypoxic regions are frequent in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common type of malignant adult brain tumor, and increased levels of tumor hypoxia have been associated with worse clinical outcomes. To unmask genes important in hypoxia, we treated GBM neurospheres in hypoxia and identified monocarboxylate transporter-4 (MCT4) as one of the most upregulated genes. To investigate the clinical importance of MCT4 in GBM, we examined clinical outcomes and found that MCT4 overexpression is associated with shorter patient survival. Consistent with this, MCT4 upregulation correlated with the aggressive mesenchymal subset of GBM, and MCT4 downregulation correlated with the less aggressive G-CIMP (Glioma CpG Methylator Phenotype) subset of GBM. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays confirmed that MCT4 protein levels were increased in high-grade as compared with lower-grade astrocytomas, further suggesting that MCT4 is a clinically relevant target. To test the requirement for MCT4 in vitro, we transduced neurospheres with lentiviruses encoding short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against MCT4, resulting in growth inhibition of 50-80% under hypoxia in two lines. MCT4 knockdown was associated with a decreased percentage of cells expressing the stem-cell marker CD133 and increased apoptotic fraction. We also found that flow-sorted CD133-positive cells had almost sixfold higher MCT4 levels than CD133-negative cells, suggesting that the stem-like population might have a greater requirement for MCT4. Most importantly, MCT4 silencing also slowed GBM intracranial xenograft growth in vivo. Interestingly, whereas MCT4 is a well-characterized lactate exporter, we found that both intracellular and extracellular lactate levels did not change following MCT4 silencing, suggesting a novel lactate export-independent mechanism for growth inhibition in GBMs. To identify this potential mechanism, we performed microarray analysis on control and shMCT4-expressing neurospheres and found a dramatic reduction in the expression of multiple Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF)-regulated genes following MCT4 knockdown. The overall reduction in HIF transcriptional response was further validated using a hypoxia response element (HRE)-dependent green-fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter line."

https://openalex.org/W2133462710,"Myometrial contraction is a central feature of labor. Although a link between infection and preterm labor is widely accepted, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms coupling infection-induced inflammation to myocyte contractile machinery. This study explores the myocyte response to pathogen-derived ligands in vitro. The pregnant human myometrial cell line PHM1-41 and primary cultured uterine myocytes responded to Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, including the bacterial wall component LPS, which at 100 ng/ml increased contraction of cells embedded within collagen gels over 72 h compared to PBS. LPS-treated myocytes secreted inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin F2α, the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, and a range of chemokines. The contractile response to LPS required TLR4 signaling and was independent of prostaglandin synthesis. Neutralizing TNF-α had no effect on LPS-mediated contraction; however, the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors Y-27632 (10 μM) and GSK-269962 (50 nM) both abrogated the contractile response. The finding of LPS-mediated contraction was supported by a 1.38 ± 0.072-fold (mean±SE) increase in myosin light-chain phosphorylation 48 h post-treatment, assessed by in-cell Western blot analysis. Together, these data suggest that, in addition to modulating the local inflammatory environment, pathogen-derived ligands may directly promote myometrial contractility via Rho/ROCK signaling, thus contributing to preterm labor-mediated preterm birth."
https://openalex.org/W1503431777,"The constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling in the mammary basal epithelial cell layer in transgenic K5ΔNβcat mice leads to basal-type tumor development. Integrins of the β1 family and integrin-mediated signaling events have an important role in breast tumor growth and progression. We show here that the deletion of α3β1 integrin, a major laminin receptor, from the basal layer of the mammary epithelium of K5ΔNβcat mice completely prevented the tumorigenesis induced by β-catenin signaling. Moreover, the depletion of α3β1 integrin from a spontaneously transformed mouse mammary basal epithelial cell line (MEC) prevented the cells from forming colonies in soft agar and greatly reduced tumor development in orthotopic grafts. Inhibition of the integrin signaling intermediates Rac1 or PAK1 (P21-activated Kinase 1) in MEC affected tumor cell growth in soft agar, whereas the expression of activated forms of these effectors in α3-depleted cells rescued the capacity of these cells to grow in non-adherent conditions. Similarly, the tumorigenic potential of α3-depleted cells was restored by the expression of activated PAK1, as assessed by orthotopic transplantation assay. In three-dimensional Matrigel culture, MEC survival and proliferation were affected by the depletion of α3β1 integrin, which also significantly decreased the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). Our data suggest that the activation of signaling cascades downstream from α3β1 and involving the Rac1/PAK1 pathway, MAPK and JNK, promotes prosurvival and proproliferative signals required for the malignant growth of basal mammary epithelial cells, providing further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer initiation and progression."
https://openalex.org/W1989435100,"Endoglin is a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) coreceptor that serves as a prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic vascular target in human cancer. A number of endoglin ectodomain-targeting antibodies (Abs) can effectively suppress both normal and tumor-associated angiogenesis, but their molecular actions remain poorly characterized. Here we define a key mechanism for TRACON105 (TRC105), a humanized monoclonal Ab in clinical trials for treatment of advanced or metastatic tumors. TRC105, along with several other endoglin Abs tested, enhance endoglin shedding through direct coupling of endoglin and the membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 at the cell surface to release the antiangiogenic factor, soluble endoglin (sEng). In addition to this coupling process, endoglin shedding is further amplified by increased MMP-14 expression that requires TRC105 concentration-dependent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. There were also notable counterbalancing effects on canonical Smad signaling in which TRC105 abrogated both the steady-state and TGF-β-induced Smad1/5/8 activation while augmenting Smad2/3 activation. Interestingly, TRC105-induced sEng and aberrant Smad signaling resulted in an excessive migratory response through enhanced stress fiber formation and disruption of endothelial cell–cell junctions. Collectively, our study defines endoglin shedding and deregulated TGF-β signaling during migration as major mechanisms by which TRC105 inhibits angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2098033989,"EGFRvIII is a key oncogene in glioblastoma (GBM). EGFRvIII results from an in-frame deletion in the extracellular domain of EGFR, does not bind ligand and is thought to be constitutively active. Although EGFRvIII dimerization is known to activate EGFRvIII, the factors that drive EGFRvIII dimerization and activation are not well understood. Here we present a new model of EGFRvIII activation and propose that oncogenic activation of EGFRvIII in glioma cells is driven by co-expressed activated EGFR wild type (EGFRwt). Increasing EGFRwt leads to a striking increase in EGFRvIII tyrosine phosphorylation and activation while silencing EGFRwt inhibits EGFRvIII activation. Both the dimerization arm and the kinase activity of EGFRwt are required for EGFRvIII activation. EGFRwt activates EGFRvIII by facilitating EGFRvIII dimerization. We have previously identified HB-EGF, a ligand for EGFRwt, as a gene induced specifically by EGFRvIII. In this study, we show that HB-EGF is induced by EGFRvIII only when EGFRwt is present. Remarkably, altering HB-EGF recapitulates the effect of EGFRwt on EGFRvIII activation. Thus, increasing HB-EGF leads to a striking increase in EGFRvIII tyrosine phosphorylation while silencing HB-EGF attenuates EGFRvIII phosphorylation, suggesting that an EGFRvIII-HB-EGF-EGFRwt feed-forward loop regulates EGFRvIII activation. Silencing EGFRwt or HB-EGF leads to a striking inhibition of EGFRvIII-induced tumorigenicity, while increasing EGFRwt or HB-EGF levels resulted in accelerated EGFRvIII-mediated oncogenicity in an orthotopic mouse model. Furthermore, we demonstrate the existence of this loop in human GBM. Thus, our data demonstrate that oncogenic activation of EGFRvIII in GBM is likely maintained by a continuous EGFRwt-EGFRvIII-HB-EGF loop, potentially an attractive target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2120439521,"We evaluated the therapeutic potential of a sustained nitric oxide (NO)-releasing compound to correct the molecular hallmarks and pathophysiology of priapism, an important but poorly characterized erectile disorder. 1,5-Bis-(dihexyl-N-nitrosoamino)-2,4-dinitrobenzene (C6') and an inactive form of the compound [1,5-bis-(dihexylamino)-2,4-dinitrobenzene (C6)] were tested in neuronal cell cultures and penile lysates for NO release (Griess assay) and biological activity (cGMP production). The effect of local depot C6' or C6 was evaluated in mice with a priapic phenotype due to double neuronal and endothelial NO synthase deletion (dNOS(-/-)) or human sickle hemoglobin transgenic expression (Sickle). Changes in NO signaling molecules and reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrogates were assessed by Western blot. The physiological response after C6' treatment was assessed using an established model of electrically stimulated penile erection. C6' generated NO, increased cGMP, and dose dependently increased NO metabolites. C6' treatment reversed abnormalities in key penile erection signaling molecules, including phosphodiesterase type 5, phosphorylated endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. In Sickle mice, C6' also attenuated the increased ROS markers gp91(phox), 4-hydroxynonenal, and 3-nitrotyrosine. Finally, C6' corrected the excessive priapic erection response of dNOS(-/-) mice. Exogenous sustained NO release from C6' corrects pathological erectile signaling in mouse models of priapism and suggests novel approaches to human therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2006939007,"Bone marrow mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BM-MSCs) can infiltrate into tumors and subsequently evolve into tumor resident MSCs in tumor microenvironment. In this study, using a mouse lymphoma model, we showed that the lymphoma resident MSCs (L-MSCs) are able to confer tumor-promoting property to the naïve cocultured BM-MSCs. Examination of cytokines and chemokines showed that post exposure to L-MSCs, BM-MSCs acquired an expression profile that is similar to that in L-MSCs. In vivo, BM-MSCs educated by L-MSCs (BM-L-MSCs) possess a greatly enhanced ability in promoting lymphoma growth. Consistent with an elevated CCL-2 expression in BM-L-MSCs, the tumor-promoting effect of BM-L-MSCs largely depends on CCR2-mediated macrophage recruitment to tumor sites. We further showed that the transmission of tumor-promoting effect is partially mediated by soluble factors. Our findings thus revealed a novel reinforcing mechanism in the maintenance of tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2171205177,"The mitotic spindle is assembled by the coordinated action of centrosomes and kinetochore microtubules. An evolutionally conserved protein family, transforming acidic coiled-coil (TACC), has been shown to be involved in this process. In humans, TACC3 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of human cancers, but its biological significance remains to be elucidated. Here, using a novel compound targeting TACC3, spindlactone (SPL), we show that the perturbation of TACC3 selectively inhibited the nucleation of centrosome microtubules in ovarian cancer cells. In contrast to centrosome microtubules, the kinetochore microtubules were robustly assembled, forming ectopic spindle poles that resulted in multipolar spindles. Interestingly, the extensive inhibition of TACC3 partially suppressed the nucleation of kinetochore microtubules. These dose-dependent effects of SPL were consistent with the results observed by the depletion of TACC3 and its binding partner, colonic and hepatic tumor overexpressed gene protein (TOGp). Although these proteins both have roles in the assembly of centrosome and kinetochore microtubules, their contributions were spatiotemporally different. Notably, SPL did not affect spindle assembly in normal cells. Furthermore, the oral administration of SPL significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo. The unique mechanism of action of SPL not only enables it to be used as a tool to dissect the molecular basis of spindle assembly but also to provide a rationale for the use of TACC3 as a molecular target for cancer treatment. This rationale offers an opportunity to develop new strategies for cancer chemotherapy that overcome the limitations of microtubule toxins and expand their scope and clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2153009342,"Serous ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in Western countries. The molecular events that underlie the development of the disease have been elusive for many years. The recent identification of the fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells (FTSECs) as the cell-of-origin for most cases of this disease has led to studies aimed at elucidating new candidate therapeutic pathways through profiling of normal FTSECs and serous carcinomas. Here we describe the results of transcriptional profiles that identify the loss of the tumor suppressive transcription factor FOXO3a in a vast majority of high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. We show that FOXO3a loss is a hallmark of the earliest stages of serous carcinogenesis and occurs both at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. We describe several mechanisms responsible for FOXO3a inactivity, including chromosomal deletion (chromosome 6q21), upregulation of miRNA-182 and destabilization by activated PI3K and MEK. The identification of pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer can advance the management of this disease from being dependant on surgery and cytotoxic chemotherapy alone to the era of targeted therapy. Our data strongly suggest FOXO3a as a possible target for clinical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2075489157,"This study was designed to investigate the role of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/p70(S6K) signaling path on regulation of primary normal human bronchial epithelial cell-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, and -9 expression in tuberculosis (TB). These MMPs are key in pathological extracellular matrix degradation in TB. Normal human bronchial epithelials were stimulated with conditioned medium from monocytes infected with virulent TB (CoMTb) and components of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway blocked using specific chemical inhibitors and siRNA. MMP gene expression was measured by RT-PCR and secretion by ELISA, luminex, or zymography. Phospho-p70 S6K was detected by Western blot analysis and activity blocked by rapamycin. Chemical blockade of the proximal catalytic PI3K p110 subunit augmented MMP-1 and MMP-9 in a dose-dependent manner (all P<0.001) but suppressed MMP-3 (P<0.01). Targeted siRNA studies identified the p110α isoform as key causing 5-fold increase in TB network-dependent MMP-1 secretion to 4900 ± 1100 pg/ml. Specific inhibition of the AKT node suppressed all 3 MMPs. Phospho-p70(S6K) was identified in the cellular model, and rapamycin, a p70(S6K) inhibitor, inhibited MMP-1 (P<0.001) and MMP-3 (P<0.01) but not MMP-9. Controls were epithelial cells that were unstimulated or exposed to conditioned medium from monocytes not exposed to TB. In summary, blockade of the proximal PI3K catalytic subunit increases MMP-1 and MMP-9, whereas rapamycin decreased both MMP-1 and MMP-3. The regulation of the PI3K path in TB is complex, MMP specific, and a potential immunotherapeutic target in diseases characterized by tissue destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2045748716,"Tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2 are suppressors of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR is the major component of two protein complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. Inactive mutation of either TSC1 or TSC2 unleashes mTOR signaling and consequently causes TSC, a benign tumor syndrome affecting multiple organs. We report here that expression of αB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1−/− or Tsc2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis nodules. αB-crystallin was transcriptionally activated by mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2): nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) signaling cascade. The augmented αB-crystallin was critical for the migration, invasion and apoptotic resistance of Tsc2-defective cells. Disruption of αB-crystallin suppressed Tsc2-null cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Therefore, enhanced αB-crystallin has an essential role in TSC1/2 complex deficiency-mediated tumorigenesis, and inhibition of αB-crystallin may complement the current therapy for TSC."
