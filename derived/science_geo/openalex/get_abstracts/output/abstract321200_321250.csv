https://openalex.org/W1987003587,"Transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana expressing the bacterial enzyme salicylate hydroxylase cannot accumulate salicylic acid (SA). This defect not only makes the plants unable to induce systemic acquired resistance, but also leads to increased susceptibility to viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens. The enhanced susceptibility extends even to host-pathogen combinations that would normally result in genetic resistance. Therefore, SA accumulation is essential for expression of multiple modes of plant disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2111629830,"Dendrimers are well-defined, highly branched macromolecules that emanate from a central core and are synthesized through a stepwise, repetitive reaction sequence. The synthesis and characterization of dendritic boxes, based on the construction of a chiral shell of protected amino acids onto poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers with 64 amine end groups, is reported here. Nuclear magnetic resonance-relaxation and optical data show that a dense shell with solid-phase character is formed. Guest molecules were captured within the internal cavities of the boxes when these boxes were constructed in the presence of guest molecules. The diffusion of guest molecules out of the boxes into solution was unmeasurably slow because of the close packing of the shell. These monomolecular dendritic containers of 5-nanometer dimensions with physically locked-in guest molecules were characterized spectroscopically."

The structure consists of a nearly hexagonal two-dimensional arrangement of the hydrocarbon chains with a dimerization of the sulfur head groups (accommodated through a gauche bond), resulting in a S-S spacing of 2.2 angstroms. These results demonstrate the importance of internal molecular degrees of freedom in the templating of ""soft"" organic materials on inorganic substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1978864750,"Carbon nanotubes produced in arcs have been found to have the form of multiwalled fullerenes, at least over short lengths. Sintering of the tubes to each other is the predominant source of defects that limit the utility of these otherwise perfect fullerene structures. The use of a water-cooled copper cathode minimized such defects, permitting nanotubes longer than 40 micrometers to be attached to macroscopic electrodes and extracted from the bulk deposit. A detailed mechanism that features the high electric field at (and field-emission from) open nanotube tips exposed to the arc plasma, and consequent positive feedback effects from the neutral gas and plasma, is proposed for tube growth in such arcs."
https://openalex.org/W2071077484,"The breeding chronology and reproductive attempts of the seabird community on Christmas Island in the central Pacific Ocean (2 degrees N, 157 degrees W) were interrupted by the 1982-1983 El Niño Southern Oscillation. The resultant reproductive failure and disappearance of the entire seabird community of this equatorial atoll represents the most dramatic interruption on record of a seabird community located distant from coastal upwelling. Our data indicate the effect that the abiotic and biotic aspects of a global atmospheric-oceanic anomaly have on marine birds. The 1982-1983 El Niño Southern Oscillation provides an example of selective pressures and a natural experiment in the study of vertebrate population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2054186411,"Ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional images of a microscopic test object were made with soft x-rays collected with a scanning transmission x-ray microscope. The test object consisted of two different patterns of gold bars on silicon nitride windows that were separated by ∼5 micrometers. Depth resolution comparable to the transverse resolution was achieved by recording nine two-dimensional images of the object at angles between –50 and +55 degrees with respect to the beam axis. The projections were then combined tomographically to form a three-dimensional image by means of an algorithm using an algebraic reconstruction technique. A transverse resolution of ∼1000 angstroms was observed. Artifacts in the reconstruction limited the overall depth resolution to ∼6000 angstroms; however, some features were clearly reconstructed with a depth resolution of ∼1000 angstroms."
https://openalex.org/W2052869621,"A comparison of paleobotanical records with archeological and ethnographic evidence from the Pacific Northwest shows a strong correlation between the expansion of Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) in coastal forests between 5000 and 2500 years ago and the evolution of a massive woodworking technology by native cultures. This suggests that an important component of cultural development was environmentally constrained until large cedar trees, the basic resource for canoe-building and plank-house construction, had become available in late Holocene time."
https://openalex.org/W2093519489,"In Texas, great egret Casmerodius albus chicks attack younger nestmates, often fatally (siblicide). By contrast, the young of neighboring great blue herons Ardea herodias seldom strike or kill siblings. These interspecific differences seem related to prey size: only fish provided by egret parents are small enough for chicks to monopolize (a process facilitated by aggression). Experimentally cross-fostered heron chicks raised on small prey by egret parents became siblicidal, but the reverse procedure of cross-fostering egret chicks did not reduce aggression or siblicide."
https://openalex.org/W1974010434,Sex ratios of hatchling loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta taken from South Carolina and Georgia ranged from no females in nests laid in late May to 80 percent females in those laid in early July; the sex ratio decreased to 10 percent females in nests laid in early August. These seasonal changes are consistent with the role of temperature in directing sexual differentiation in various reptiles. The data have implications for understanding the demography of sea turtles and for their conservation.

This system is characterized by the existence of a particle called the composite fermion, which manifests itself in several dramatic experimental observations."
https://openalex.org/W1964026255,"The results of observations of Jupiter at 18 megacycles per second indicate that the apparent rotation period drifts cyclically about a constant mean value. The most probable drift period appears to be 11.9 years, Jupiter's orbital period. The mean rotation period during one orbital period is about 0.3 second longer than that of the system III (1957.0) period. This is in close agreement with the rotation period deduced from decimetric observations and probably represents the true rotation period of the magnetic field. The cyclic drift in the rotation period of source A at 18 megacycles per second is explained on the basis of beaming of the escaping radiation at an angle 6 degrees north of the magnetic equator. The apparent rotation period of source A depends on the rate of change of the Jovicentric declination of Earth."
https://openalex.org/W2093122821,"Over the past few years, the satellite topside sounders have significantly contributed to the understanding of the upper ionosphere. A great quantity of radio echo data has been accumulated, from which the ionospheric electrondensity distribution can be determined. The topside measurements of electron density essentially agree with similar measurements from the ground, except for an occasional 10-percent discrepancy near the peak of the ionosphere. While horizontal non-uniformity is a likely cause, this discrepancy has not yet been adequately explained. The electron-density scale heights measured at a constant altitude indicate both a higher temperature and a heavier mean ion mass at high latitudes. At low latitudes the topside measurements have shown the detailed latitudinal structure of the equatorial anomaly, demonstrating control by the geomagnetic field. A variety of electron-density irregularities have been studied. Most are greatly elongated along the magnetic field, and produce echoes either by lateral scattering, if they are thin, or by longitudinal ducting, if they are thick. Some of the thick irregularities are continuous between the hemispheres and support conjugate echo propagation. The topside sounders have revealed the complex structure of the ionosphere near the auroral zone and at higher latitudes. At night an east-west trough of greatly reduced electron density occurs equatorward of the auroral zone. At the auroral zone itself the electron density is high and quite variable, both in space and time. The electron density at the polar cap within the auroral zone is often uniform and smooth. Ionospheric irregularities are common in the area of the trough and the auroral zone. Among other satellites, the topside sounders have been used in various plasma studies involving the excitation and propagation of waves. These studies suggest that the ionosphere is an appropriate region for future plasma physics investigations, especially with rocket and satellite payloads designed specifically for that purpose."

These records refute previous interpretation of structural benches of older, nearly horizontal strata outcropping on the slope face."
https://openalex.org/W2013221660,"Observations now require that there be a continuous supply of energy to the giant extragalactic radio sources. These observations also suggest that this energy input may be in the form of streams or jets of gas emanating from the centers of galaxies and quasi-stellar objects. Current data indicate that the large-scale jet structures are not moving with relativistic speeds, as previously proposed. Slow-moving jets, which possess turbulent interiors and are dominated by relatively cool gas, can account for the observed jet properties at optical and radio wavelengths. Extremely small-scale jets observed adjacent to the central energy source may or may not be in relativistic motion."
https://openalex.org/W2013687832,"A specimen of the murid rodent Nesokia indica has been recovered from a late Paleolithic archeological site in the Sudan. This is a range 1200 km south of the site of any known occurrences, and it indicates a different environment near the Nile River than that which exists at the present time. The late Paleolithic water table is inferred to have been more stable, allowing for permanent moist soil."

https://openalex.org/W2051918466,"These six Japanese science education centers signify a sweeping reform of elementary and secondary school science teaching. They achieve their striking results because they are established on a permanent, local basis and are supported mainly by the local boards of education. They have avoided control by pedagogues and specialists in ""education."" Instead, they are operated by trained scientists and experienced school teachers who work together to devise programs specially suited to the needs of their teachers. With small and practicable steps, the teachers improve their understanding of methods which they can readily test in their own classrooms rooms and laboratories. The laboratory equipment in the science education centers is only slightly superior to that which the teachers have in their own schools, but superior enough to make them desire to improve their own facilities. Major facilities, such as x-ray machines, electron microscopes, telescopes (15-cm), and machine shops, as well as good working collections of minerals and fossils, and adequate greenhouses, permit the teachers to work with more expensive equipment, to gain a firsthand knowledge of its operation, and to bring groups of students to the center to observe what such instruments make possible. The use of American experimental course content improvement programs is widespread. Every science education center I visited is using PSSC, CHEMS, CBA, BSCS, or ESCP materials and studying the philosophy of these programs. Yet no center is entirely dependent on these programs, but uses them critically to supplement and improve its own courses. The emphasis is on good laboratory and field teaching as a basis for understanding scientific methods and concepts. Science as investigation and inquiry, instead of treatment solely as an authoritative body of facts, is coming into its own. The few defects of the science education centers of Japan inhere in the educational situation itself. The centers are at present inadequate to reach even a reasonable proportion of the science teachers within a 5-year, or even a 10-year cycle. The shortage of substitute teachers causes most of the courses to be far too brief for maximum effectiveness. Staff programming tends to be rather spotty instead of comprehensive. A major difficulty, frequently expressed, lies in the grim hold of the university entrance examination system over the science curricula of the lower schools. The university is the goal of every able student, for economic as well as intellectual reasons. To enter a university he must pass the examinations, which are established separately by each institution. The professor who makes out the examination questions therefore controls what must be taught and learned in the lower schools. This same rigorous control is in part reflected in the Ministry of Education syllabi, which must be followed by the teachers. Nevertheless, I found the men in the biological section of the Ministry of Education very enlightened and pressing for change. Many professors in the universities are also in the full current of modern biological thought, participate gladly in the programs of the science education centers, and would write examinations that emphasize interpreting data, applying tests to hypotheses, and drawing valid conclusions instead of merely memorizing and regurgitating facts. On the other hand, in many universities the upper positions are still filled by men to whom biology means classification rather than experimentation, morphology rather than biochemistry, organ physiology rather than cell biology. We cannot afford to discard taxonomy, morphology, or gross physiology-they are important parts of biology and will remain so. But they do not comprise all of biology-they are only a diminishing proportion of it. In Japan, as in the United States, the examination system must become more flexible. It must change with the development of science itself, must encourage scientific attitudes and cease defeating the introduction of new disciplines, new outlooks, new subject matter. The university and the examining boards in some educational systems indeed exhibit a rigor mortis. On balance, the science education centers in Japan may well represent the most significant educational experiment of our time. Their vitality, which springs from their local relationship to the prefectural schools and their permenent staffs, far exceeds in my own estimation that of most of the summer science institutes held in the United States, which lack that close relation to the local schools and which by their impermanency countenance ill-planned and ill-taught programs that are often little different from the usual summer school sessions. The best summer institutes in the United States are indeed very good, but far too few of them reach a passable standard. That is because, for the most part, their staffs are recruited quickly, teach their favorite subjects without much consideration of their appropriateness or suitability for improving science education in the lower schools, and depart without much contact with other members of the staff. What is needed is serious, continuous, prolonged, hard work devoted to the development of the right sorts of courses for renewing the training of science teachers. The Japanese seem to be achieving just that. We would do well, with our vast resources for the improvement of education, to emulate them. As they have profited by employing and improving upon our NSF supported programs in science education, we may likewise profit through the establishment of science education centers modeled on theirs."
