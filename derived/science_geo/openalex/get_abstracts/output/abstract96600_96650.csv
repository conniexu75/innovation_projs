https://openalex.org/W2149300987,"The interaction of free fatty acids with cell membranes and lipid bilayers was studied by monitoring the emission polarization changes of the fluorescent probes 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS). It was found that cis unsaturated fatty acids incorporated into plasma membranes reduced DPH and increased ANS polarization, while trans-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids had no effect on DPH, but did increase ANS polarization. Although in fluid lipid vesicles, both types of fatty acids decreased DPH polarization, in mixed phase vesicles (dilauroyl phosphatidylcho1ine:dipalmitoy1 phosphatidylcholine) polarization changes of ANS and DPH were similar to that observed in plasma membranes. Alteration in the dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine phase transition as a function of fatty acid type was used to study the fluid-solid partition behavior in lipid bilayers. Using solution theory, the shift in the transition midpoint temperature was used to infer that the el-unsaturated fatty acids partition into fluid domains while the tmns-unsaturated and saturated fatty acids preferentially partition into solid-like domains. The fluorescent lifetime of DPH in membranes and vesicles was measured by the phase-modulation technique. The results were analyzed in terms of site heterogeneity and indicate that while DPH decay in single phase vesicles is monoexponential, a considerable degree of heterogeneity is observed in mixed phase vesicles and plasma membranes. In particular, evidence is obtained for a DPH binding site which corresponds to the interface between lipid domains. These results, together with the free fatty acid effects, are interpreted in terms of lipid domains in membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2070842533,"Mothers among !Kung hunter-gatherers nurse briefly and frequently, with brief intervals between nursing bouts (mean +/- standard error, 13.19 +/- 1.28 minutes). The low levels of 17 beta-estradiol and progesterone in the serum of the mother are correlated with infant's age and with interbout interval, but not with total nursing time. Maternal gonadal function is apparently suppressed by a timing-dependent, prolactin-mediated effect of breast stimulation. Interbout interval may be a key variable in lactation infertility. If so, it solves the puzzle of !Kung birth spacing."
https://openalex.org/W1534056652,"Abstract The canine lipoproteins containing only the E apoprotein (apo-E HDLc), when perfused through a rat liver, display high affinity, receptor-mediated uptake, and saturation kinetics. These data indicate that the hepatic uptake of apo-E HDLc proceeds via a finite number of binding sites. The kinetic values determined for apo-E HDLc binding and uptake during a single-pass perfusion through a rate liver are: Km = 4.99 micrograms of protein . ml-1 and Vmax = 6.42 microgram of protein . g-1 . min-1. On a molar basis, the hepatic extraction of apo-E HDLc is almost equivalent to the high hepatic extraction of a class of lipoproteins that is most avidly removed from systemic circulation--the rat chylomicron remnants. Competition experiments between apo-E HDLc and rat chylomicron remnants indicate that the hepatic uptake mechanism for the two macromolecules is identical. Given that the recognition of apo-E HDLc is mediated by the E apoprotein and that the kinetic uptake properties of chylomicron remnants and apo-E HDLc are almost identical, it is probable that the E apoprotein is the major determinant responsible for hepatic chylomicron remnant recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1562774482,"The synthesis and accumulation of cholesteryl esters by monolayers of mouse peritoneal macrophages was stimulated 20- to 160-fold by incubation with beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL, density less than 1.006 g/ml) isolated from the plasma of cholesterol-fed dogs. Three other cholesterol-rich lipoprotein fractions obtained from the plasma of the same hypercholesterolemic dogs, including low density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol-induced high density lipoprotein (HDLc), and apo-E HDLc, had little to no stimulatory effect. Plasma VLDL (density less than 1.006 g/ml) from normal dogs did not increase cholesteryl ester formation in macrophages. The enhancement in cholesteryl ester synthesis and accumulation by hypercholesterolemic canine beta-VLDL was due to the presence of a high affinity binding site on the macrophage cell surface that mediated the uptake and lysosomal degradation of the beta-VLDL. Competition studies with fucoidin and dextran sulfate indicated that the receptor for canine beta-VLDL was different from that previously described for human acetylated low density lipoprotein (acetyl-LDL). Prior incubation of macrophage monolayers with either unlabeled canine beta-VLDL or human acetyl-LDL, both of which raised the cellular content of cholesteryl esters, reduced the ability of the cells to degrade 125I-labeled beta-VLDL, suggesting that the receptor for beta-VLDL is subject to regulation. The current findings indicate: 1) that macrophages possess a high affinity receptor that recognizes one of the four cholesterol-rich lipoproteins present in the plasma of cholesterol-fed dogs, beta-VLDL, and 2) that the receptor-mediated ingestion of beta-VLDL leads to cholesteryl ester deposition in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2083925556,Intraocular grafts of chick epithelium combined with mouse molar mesenchyme produced a variety of dental structures including perfectly formed crowns with differentiated ameloblasts depositing enamel matrix. The results suggest that the loss of teeth in Aves did not result from a loss of genetic coding for enamel synthesis in the oral epithelium but from an alteration in the tissue interactions requisite for odontogenesis.
https://openalex.org/W1533884306,"The intracellular distribution of lipophilic ions and weak acids and bases was studied in intact hepatocytes as indicators of gradients of pH and membrane potential. Mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials of 161 and 32.8 mV (negative inside), respectively, were calculated from the intracellular accumulation of triphenylmethylphosphonium (TPMP+) and thiocyanate in the intact hepatocyte, assuming a two-compartment model. The predominantly mitochondrial localization of TPMP+ was confirmed using disruption procedures that selectively break the plasma membrane but not the mitochondrial membrane. The intracellular distribution of 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione and methylamine was studied with similar techniques. A cytosolic pH of 6.95 to 7.00 and a mitochondrial delta pH of 0.97 units was observed. From these results, a total mitochondrial protonmotive force in the intact cell in excess of -200 mV was obtained."

By using this reconstitution assay, the channel-forming protein in the mung bean mitochondria was identified as protein(s) with an apparent molecular weight of 30,000 through differential detergent extraction and centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient. The channel was nonspecific, and allowed the diffusion of saccharides of up to 2000 to 8000 daltons."

https://openalex.org/W1563136437,"The ratio of initiation of protein synthesis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in culture is reduced by over 60% in the absence of a single essential amino acid. Cell-free extracts prepared from control and amino acid-starved cells retain some of the translational characteristics of these cells and are able to form [40 S.Met-tRNAfMet] initiation complexes. Studies with inhibitors show that up to 63% of the translation directed by endogenous mRNAs in vitro depends on reinitiation of polypeptide chains. Amino acid starvation inhibits this activity, as well as protein synthesis due to in vitro polysomal run-off, by up to 75%. Analysis of [40 S.Met-tRNAfMet]initiation complexes formed in vitro on native 40 S subunits shows that amino acid starvation causes up to a 77% decrease in the concentration of these complexes relative to the corresponding fed controls. This difference is eliminated by the addition of highly purified eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-2. Factor eIF-3 also stimulates [40 S.Met-tRNAfMet] formation in the cell extracts but does not abolish the difference between fed and starved preparations. Mixing experiments have not so far revealed any inhibitor of initiation complex formation in the starved cell extracts."

Bronchial caliber, as assessed by changes in pulmonary resistance, demonstrated a marked dilatation, and dilatation could still be demonstrated after preliminary treatment with reserpine. By stimulating the component branches of the vagus nerve, it was determined that the parasympathetic branch is responsible for this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1549133456,"T200 glycoprotein, a major cell surface component of murine hematopoietic cells, is a phosphorylated transmembrane glycoprotein. Two distinct regions of the molecule can be defined by radiolabeling with a variety of metabolic precursors or by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, in combination with protease treatments, immunoprecipitation techniques, and peptide mapping analysis. A relative protease-resistant domain, which is exposed on the cell surface and contains the antigenic site recognized by a monoclonal anti-T200 antibody known to react with the exterior cell surface, contains most if not all of the mannose-containing oligosaccharide units of the glycoprotein and all of the amino acid residues labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of intact viable cells. This protease-resistant fragment migrates with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 100,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The remaining portion of the molecule contains a region, extensively digested by trypsin, which is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane and contains phosphoserine residues which can be labeled with 32PO4 in vivo. A 125I-labeled tryptic peptide derived from this region of the molecule was obtained if membrane preparations from cells disrupted by nitrogen cavitation were labeled by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination."
https://openalex.org/W1560056637,"X-ray crystallographic study of the ferredoxin-like protein (iron-sulfur protein III) from Azotobacter vinelandii has been extended to 2.5-A resolution. A 4.0-A resolution electron density map revealed that the molecule contains two Fe-S clusters of differing size and shape separated by 12 A (Stout, C.D. (1979) Nature 279, 83-84). Recent Mossbauer results by Emptage et al. (Emptage, M.H., Kent, T.A., Huynh, B.H., Rawlings, J., Orme-Johnson, W.H., and Munck, E. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1793-1796) have shown that the molecule contains 7 iron atoms as a high potential iron protein-like Fe4 center and a novel 3-Fe center. The 2.5-A electron density map shows two distinctly different Fe-S clusters. The larger cluster consists of a tetranuclear [4Fe-4S] core ligated to the protein at each iron atom. The smaller cluster is distinctly planar and cannot be modeled with [2Fe-2S] or [4Fe-4S] structures. The best model for this cluster is a [3Fe-3S] core. The protein makes six contacts with this cluster."

https://openalex.org/W2054137681,"Intrinsic myogenic tone in the buccal segment of the rabbit facial vein is exquisitely sensitive to small changes in temperature in the range 33 degrees to 44 degrees C. This particular venous segment also exhibits a preponderance of beta-adrenergic receptors and receives a dense, medial sympathetic innervation. This area of the vein is proposed to act as a temperature-sensitive sphincter that distributes cooled nasal venous blood between superficial and deep venous drainage systems in the head and neck. Deviation of cool blood to deeper venous sinuses has been shown to be an important thermoregulatory mechanism."

Each chiral thiophosphate was incorporated into isomer A of ATP beta S with distinct oxygen isotopic labelings, which were characterized by 31P NMR. The 3-phosphoglycerate kinase-catalyzed reaction was shown to proceed by inversion at phosphorus since all other steps in the reaction sequence between inorganic thiophosphate and ATP beta S were of known stereospecificity."

Accordingly, the sites of Schiff base formation of the sugar aldehyde with hemoglobin have been determined by peptide of the protein after treatment of CO-saturated sickle cells with 10 mM [14C]glyceraldehyde for 90 min and reduction with NaBH4. About 23% of the glyceraldehyde incorporated into hemoglobin was present at Val-1(beta) with very little present at Val-1(alpha) (less than 5%. The distribution of [14C]glyceraldehyde between the hemoglobin chains was 60% in the beta chains and 40% in the alpha chains. The reactive lysine residues of the beta chain were Lys-82, Lys-59, and Lys-120 (45%, 20%, and 16% of the total 14C in the beta chains, respectively). The most reactive lysine residue of the alpha chain was Lys-16 where 75% of the total [14C]glyceraldehyde was present. The limited number of sites reactive with glyceraldehyde indicate some type of selectivity in the reaction of sugar aldehydes with hemoglobin."
https://openalex.org/W1485886059,"It is shown that the protochlorophyllide pool of etiolated higher plants is made up of both monovinyl and divinyl protochlorophyllide. Although the two pigments exhibited similar emission maxima, they were distinguishable by their Soret excitation maxima, which were found at 436 to 437 and 443 to 444 nm, respectively, in ether at 77 K. The two pigments were partially separated on thin layers of polyethylene. They were shown to be accompanied by two unknown fluorescent compounds. The latter were designated compound (E451 F626) and compound (E453 F640) where E refers to the Soret excitation maxima and F to the fluorescence emission maxima of the two unknown compounds. Furthermore, it was shown under several different growth conditions that divinyl protochlorophyllide constituted the major component of the protochlorophyllide pool."
https://openalex.org/W1658256030,"An NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase specific for prostaglandin D2 was discovered and partially purified from cytosol of swine brain. Prostaglandins A2, B2, D3, E2, and F2 alpha were poor substrates for this enzyme, the rates of reaction being less than 10% of that with prostaglandin D2. The enzyme was separated by Sephadex column chromatography from the other NADP-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase that was also present in brain and metabolized prostaglandins B2, E2, and F2 alpha much more effectively than D2. The primary reaction product was tentatively identified as 15-ketoprostaglandin D2 by its characteristic absorption spectrum with a peak at 415 nm at pH 9. This compound was further converted to 13,14-dihydro-15-ketoprostaglandin D2 in the presence of NADPH by the action of 15-ketoprostaglandin delta 13-reductase that was co-purified with the dehydrogenase. This dehydrogenase appears to be responsible for the specific inactivation of prostaglandin D2 which is the major prostaglandin in the central nervous system."

An examination of the patterns of enzyme expression in the hybrids showed that, in three instances, absence of an enzyme from a specific tissue was dominant to presence. Since other developmental features indicated that both parental genomes were functioning, these results suggest that, in these cases, the pattern differences in the parental species were due to diffusible factors that affected expression of the relevant structural genes rather than to differences in the genes themselves or in cis-acting regulatory sites."

The hexokinase activity has been isolated in 35% yield as a protein that is homogeneous by polyacrylamide and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The highest specific activity obtained was 145 units/mg of proteins. The native protein has a molecular weight of 110,000 by gel filtration on Ultrogel AcA 44 and 112,000 by sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels gave a molecular weight of 110,000 indicating that hexokinase is a monomer. The enzyme had a pI of 6.20 to 6.30 pH units by isoelectric focusing. The enzyme was specific for Mg . ATP and Mg . ITP as the nucleotide substrates. Several hexokinase with different affinities."

https://openalex.org/W1498680158,"During the development and growth of the lens, lens epithelial cells differentiate to form lens fiber cells. The present study investigates phosphatidylinositol metabolism in these two lens cell populations in the 6-day-old embryonic chick in vivo, to determine whether changes in the metabolism of this phospholipid are associated with lens fiber differentiation. [32P]Orthophosphate was injected into the embryos in ovo, and the incorporation of label into phosphatidylinositol in the lens epithelia and lens fiber masses was followed for 42 h. The time course of the specific activity of the gamma-PO4 of ATP was also determined during this time period, and was shown to be approximately equal to the specific activity of CDP-diacylglycerol, the immediate precursor of phosphatidylinositol. Analysis of the data by means of a simple kinetic model yielded a value of about 2 x 10(-9) pmol/s/cell for the rate of phosphatidylinositol synthesis in the lens epithelial cells, and 6.4 x 10(-9) pmol/s/cell in the lens fiber cells; the corresponding half-lives of phosphatidylinositol were 5 h and 63 h in the epithelial cells and fiber cells, respectively. Thus, lens fiber formation in the 6-day-old embryonic chick is associated with increased synthesis and decreased turnover of phosphatidylinositol. This is the first report of changes in phosphatidylinositol metabolism associated with cell differentiation during embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1513999940,"Inhibition of highly purified rat liver fatty acid synthetase occurs when it is assayed in the presence of the ATP citrate lyase reaction components. Citrate, Mg2+, ATP, and ATP citrate lyase were all necessary for the inhibition to take place. Inhibition was prevented by hydroxycitrate, a competitive inhibitor for ATP citrate lyase. The length of time for the onset of inhibition to take place was proportional to the ratio of ATP citrate lyase activity to the fatty acid synthetase activity. The inhibition was reversed by the addition of coenzyme A. This indicates a reaction mechanism for fatty acid synthetase which involves free coenzyme A. Two possible roles for CoA are discussed, one as an allosteric activator and the other in the cleavage of palmitoyl enzyme in the last step of the reaction."

Higher concentrations of enzyme protein, as determined by competition radioimmunoassay, correspond to proportionately higher enzyme activity. Elevated superoxide dismutase levels were not related to any other clinical, historical, or demographic variables.

The proportion of the protein in the cell extract that was tubulin (4.6%) was the same in populations of both mitotic and log phase cells. The self assembly and copolymerization activity of extract tubulin were also compared for the two populations of cells. Approximately 60% of the tubulin in extracts of both mitotic enriched and log phase cells self assembled reversibly as determined by quantitative sedimentation assays. In copolymerization experiments, isotopically labeled tubulin from both mitotic enriched and log phase cell extracts was incorporated with equal efficiency into microtubules formed with microtubule protein purified from porcine brain. Greater than 80% of the tubulin in HeLa extracts participated in one cycle of reversible polymerization with carrier brain tubulin. In addition, the amount and type of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) were similar in the extracts of mitotic and log phase cells. The capacity of tubulin from the two populations to incorporate tyrosine into the COOH terminus of the (Y chain was also compared before and after partiaI digestion with carboxypeptidase A to release any endogenously bound COOH-terminal tyrosine. Once again, the results obtained for the material from the two sources showed no significant difference. In summary, no differences have yet been detected in the properties of microtubule protein in interphase and mitotic HeLa cells."

All three enzymes exist in a low Km form, which predominates at pH 3 and is stabilized by bovine serum albumin, and a high Km form, which predominates at pH 5.5 to 6.0 in the absence of serum albumin. At intermediate pH values both forms are present. Addition of 0.2 M NaCl shifts the equilibrium toward the high Km form. Both forms of these enzymes are active on 4-methyl umbelliferyl-beta-D-glucuronide and on the hexasaccharides of chondroitin-6-SO4, chondroitin, and hyaluronic acid, with the low Km forms showing 2- to 20-fold more activity on the oligosaccharide substrates than the high Km forms."

In all cases, the spectral properties of the artificial enzymes changed as a result of photoreduction in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate or oxalate as sources of reducing equivalents. The same changes were found to occur on irradiation of the enzymes which had been reduced previously in the dark under anaerobic conditions with dithionite. Using analogous 7- and 8-chlorolumiflavins, the observed changes were shown to be due to a novel photoreaction of the reduced flavin chromophore, in which either the 7- or 8-halogen substituent is eliminated and replaced by a proton derived from the solvent. The same reaction was shown to occur with 7,8-bis-norlumiflavin where 1 deuterium atom was incorporated into the molecule as a result of photoirradiation of the reduced flavin in deuterated medium. In the case of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, both the 8-chloro-FAD and 7-bromo-FAD enzymes, as well as their 8-nor-FAD and 7-nor-FAD photoproducts, possessed catalytic activity comparable to that of the native enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1501166459,"1-Anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonate (ANS) binds to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase with subsequent rapid inactivation. Kinetics are saturating, with an enzyme half-life of 0.29 min at 4 x 10(-4) M ANS. IDP, GDP, and phosphoenolpyruvate protect against the inactivation. The enzyme is not covalently modified and it retains an affinity for protecting substrates and substrate analogs, with the exception of oxalate. Binding of ANS occurs in a hydrophobic environment, as suggested by the changes in fluorescence emission, and is markedly pH-dependent, leading to more rapid inactivation at acid pH. Inactivation by ANS differs in this respect from inactivation by N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonate which affinity labels the enzyme (Silverstein, R., Rawitch, A.B., and Grainger, D.A. (1979) Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 87, 911-918). Though the mechanism by which ANS inactivates the enzyme is unclear, the effect is atypical in that ANS binding does not normally lead to irreversible inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1489888571,"Previous in vitro studies have shown that the oxidation of the side chain of bile acid precursors can start with either microsomal or mitochondrial enzyme systems. The microsomal system oxidizes the terminal methyl group (C-26) of the side chain that originates from C-2 of mevalonic acid, and the mitochondrial system oxidizes the terminal methyl group (C-27) derived from C'-3 of mevalonic acid. We administered [2-14C]-mevalonic acid to a patient with a complete bile fistula and isolated from the bile 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy[1,7,15,22,26-14C]5 beta-cholestanoic acid, a precursor in the synthesis of cholic acid which has undergone partial oxidation of the side chain. This compound was chemically decarboxylated and the liberated CO2 was trapped and counted. The recovery from control experiments using [24-14C]cholic acid was 82.6 +/- 2.3% (+/- 1 S.D.). However, following decarboxylation of 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy[14C5]5 beta-cholestanoic acid, only 7.5 +/- 0.58% (+/- S.D.) of the C-26 radioactivity was recovered. This study suggests that the major pathway of side chain oxidation of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-triol starts with hydroxylation of the methyl group derived from C'-3 of mevalonate (C-27) by mitochondrial enzymes. It is also concluded that the 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-27-oic acid formed in man has the R configuration at carbon 25."

Purification procedures result in low yields of activity even after relatively mild separation methods.

Recombination of the separated components is possible if the detergent (Triton X-100) concentration is lowered and ethylene glycol is added to the system. Under these conditions, vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of synthetic pentapeptide (Phe-Leu-Glu-Glu-Leu) can be totally reconstituted."
