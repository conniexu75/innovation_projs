https://openalex.org/W2127088485,"The subcellular position of lysosomes, whether adjacent to the plasma membrane or perinuclear, regulates mTOR signalling and autophagy in response to nutrient availablity. Lysosomal position is regulated by changes in intracellular pH. mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling and macroautophagy (henceforth autophagy) regulate numerous pathological and physiological processes, including cellular responses to altered nutrient levels. However, the mechanisms regulating mTOR and autophagy remain incompletely understood. Lysosomes are dynamic intracellular organelles1,2 intimately involved both in the activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling and in degrading autophagic substrates3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we report that lysosomal positioning coordinates anabolic and catabolic responses with changes in nutrient availability by orchestrating early plasma-membrane signalling events, mTORC1 signalling and autophagy. Activation of mTORC1 by nutrients correlates with its presence on peripheral lysosomes that are physically close to the upstream signalling modules, whereas starvation causes perinuclear clustering of lysosomes, driven by changes in intracellular pH. Lysosomal positioning regulates mTORC1 signalling, which in turn influences autophagosome formation. Lysosome positioning also influences autophagosome–lysosome fusion rates, and thus controls autophagic flux by acting at both the initiation and termination stages of the process. Our findings provide a physiological role for the dynamic state of lysosomal positioning in cells as a coordinator of mTORC1 signalling with autophagic flux."

We controlled PCM bits with single-wall and small-diameter multi-wall carbon nanotubes. This configuration achieves programming currents of 0.5 microampere (set) and 5 microamperes (reset), two orders of magnitude lower than present state-of-the-art devices. Pulsed measurements enable memory switching with very low energy consumption. Analysis of over 100 devices finds that the programming voltage and energy are highly scalable and could be below 1 volt and single femtojoules per bit, respectively."

We assessed the bactericidal activity and mechanism of action of Revamil® source (RS) honey and manuka honey, the sources of two major medical-grade honeys. RS honey killed Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 2 hours, whereas manuka honey had such rapid activity only against B. subtilis. After 24 hours of incubation, both honeys killed all tested bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but manuka honey retained activity up to higher dilutions than RS honey. Bee defensin-1 and H₂O₂ were the major factors involved in rapid bactericidal activity of RS honey. These factors were absent in manuka honey, but this honey contained 44-fold higher concentrations of methylglyoxal than RS honey. Methylglyoxal was a major bactericidal factor in manuka honey, but after neutralization of this compound manuka honey retained bactericidal activity due to several unknown factors. RS and manuka honey have highly distinct compositions of bactericidal factors, resulting in large differences in bactericidal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1977120293,"The primary cilium is an antenna-like organelle that is dynamically regulated during the cell cycle. Ciliogenesis is initiated as cells enter quiescence, whereas resorption of the cilium precedes mitosis. The mechanisms coordinating ciliogenesis with the cell cycle are unknown. Here we identify the centrosomal protein Nde1 (nuclear distribution gene E homologue 1) as a negative regulator of ciliary length. Nde1 is expressed at high levels in mitosis, low levels in quiescence and localizes at the mother centriole, which nucleates the primary cilium. Cells depleted of Nde1 have longer cilia and a delay in cell cycle re-entry that correlates with ciliary length. Knockdown of Nde1 in zebrafish embryos results in increased ciliary length, suppression of cell division, reduction of the number of cells forming the Kupffer's vesicle and left-right patterning defects. These data suggest that Nde1 is an integral component of a network coordinating ciliary length with cell cycle progression and have implications for understanding the transition from a quiescent to a proliferative state."
https://openalex.org/W1987529702,"Primary cilia are displayed during the G(0)/G(1) phase of many cell types. Cilia are resorbed as cells prepare to re-enter the cell cycle, but the causal and molecular link between these two cellular events remains unclear. We show that Tctex-1 phosphorylated at Thr 94 is recruited to ciliary transition zones before S-phase entry and has a pivotal role in both ciliary disassembly and cell cycle progression. However, the role of Tctex-1 in S-phase entry is dispensable in non-ciliated cells. Exogenously adding a phospho-mimic Tctex-1(T94E) mutant accelerates cilium disassembly and S-phase entry. These results support a model in which the cilia act as a brake to prevent cell cycle progression. Mechanistic studies show the involvement of actin dynamics in Tctex-1-regulated cilium resorption. Tctex-1 phosphorylated at Thr 94 is also selectively enriched at the ciliary transition zones of cortical neural progenitors, and has a key role in controlling G(1) length, cell cycle entry and fate determination of these cells during corticogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2093145534,"The ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes and associated proteins mediate membrane scission reactions, such as multivesicular body formation, the terminal stages of cytokinesis and retroviral particle release. These proteins are believed to be sequentially recruited to the site of membrane scission, and then complexes are disassembled by the ATPase Vps4A. However, these events have never been observed in living cells, and their dynamics are unknown. By quantifying the recruitment of several ESCRT and associated proteins during the assembly of two retroviruses, we show that Alix progressively accumulated at viral assembly sites, coincident with the accumulation of the main viral structural protein, Gag, and was not recycled after assembly. In contrast, ESCRT-III and Vps4A were transiently recruited only when the accumulation of Gag was complete. These data indicate that the rapid and transient recruitment of proteins that act late in the ESCRT pathway and carry out membrane fission is triggered by prior and progressive accumulation of proteins that bridge viral proteins and the late-acting ESCRT proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012321776,"Many animals, including the fruit fly, are sensitive to small differences in ambient temperature. The ability of Drosophila larvae to choose their ideal temperature (18°C) over other comfortable temperatures (19° to 24°C) depends on a thermosensory signaling pathway that includes a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein), a phospholipase C, and the transient receptor potential TRPA1 channel. We report that mutation of the gene (ninaE) encoding a classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Drosophila rhodopsin, eliminates thermotactic discrimination in the comfortable temperature range. This role for rhodopsin in thermotaxis toward 18°C was light-independent. Introduction of mouse melanopsin restored normal thermotactic behavior in ninaE mutant larvae. We propose that rhodopsins represent a class of evolutionarily conserved GPCRs that are required for initiating thermosensory signaling cascades."

https://openalex.org/W2092978417,"Accurate chromosome segregation depends on biorientation, whereby sister chromatids attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles. The spindle-assembly checkpoint is a surveillance mechanism in eukaryotes that inhibits anaphase until all chromosomes have bioriented. In present models, the recruitment of the spindle-assembly checkpoint protein Mad2, through Mad1, to non-bioriented kinetochores is needed to stop cell-cycle progression. However, it is unknown whether Mad1-Mad2 targeting to kinetochores is sufficient to block anaphase. Furthermore, it is unclear whether regulators of biorientation (for example, Aurora kinases) have checkpoint functions downstream of Mad1-Mad2 recruitment or whether they act upstream to quench the primary error signal. Here, we engineered a Mad1 construct that localizes to bioriented kinetochores. We show that the kinetochore localization of Mad1 is sufficient for a metaphase arrest that depends on Mad1-Mad2 binding. By uncoupling the checkpoint from its primary error signal, we show that Aurora, Mps1 and BubR1 kinases, but not Polo-like kinase, are needed to maintain checkpoint arrest when Mad1 is present on kinetochores. Together, our data suggest a model in which the biorientation errors, which recruit Mad1-Mad2 to kinetochores, may be signalled not only through Mad2 template dynamics, but also through the activity of widely conserved kinases, to ensure the fidelity of cell division."
https://openalex.org/W2098276373,"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in cellular growth control inducing a plethora of different response pathways. The molecular mechanisms that discriminate between the distinct p53-responses have remained largely elusive. Here, we have analyzed the p53-regulated pathways induced by Actinomycin D and Etoposide treatment resulting in more growth arrested versus apoptotic cells respectively. We found that the genome-wide p53 DNA-binding patterns are almost identical upon both treatments notwithstanding transcriptional differences that we observed in global transcriptome analysis. To assess the role of post-translational modifications in target gene choice and activation we investigated the genome-wide level of phosphorylation of Serine 46 of p53 bound to DNA (p53-pS46) and of Serine 15 (p53-pS15). Interestingly, the extent of S46 phosphorylation of p53 bound to DNA is considerably higher in cells directed towards apoptosis while the degree of phosphorylation at S15 remains highly similar. Moreover, our data suggest that following different chemotherapeutical treatments, the amount of chromatin-associated p53 phosphorylated at S46 but not at pS15 is higher on certain apoptosis related target genes. Our data provide evidence that cell fate decisions are not made primarily on the level of general p53 DNA-binding and that post-translationally modified p53 can have distinct DNA-binding characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2001663331,"Abnormal activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway has been described in a wide variety of human cancers and in cancer stem cells (CSCs), however, the role of SHH pathway in gastric CSCs has not been reported. In this study, we investigated the possibility that abnormal activation of the SHH pathway maintained the characteristics of gastric CSCs. First, we identified cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) from human gastric cancer cell lines (HGC-27, MGC-803 and MKN-45) using tumorsphere culture. Compared with adherent cells, the floating tumorsphere cells had more self-renewing capacity and chemoresistance. The cells expressing CSCs markers (CD44, CD24 and CD133) were also significantly more in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells. More importantly, in vivo xenograft studies showed that tumors could be generated with 2×104 tumorsphere cells, which was 100-fold less than those required for tumors seeding by adherent cells. Next, RT-PCR and Western blot showed that the expression levels of Ptch and Gli1 (SHH pathway target genes) were significantly higher in tumorsphere cells than in adherent cells. The results of quantitative real-time PCR were similar to those of RT-PCR and Western blot. Further analysis revealed that SHH pathway blocked by cyclopamine or 5E1 caused a higher reduction in self-renewing capacity of HGC-27 tumorsphere cells than that of adherent cells. We also found that SHH pathway blocking strongly enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs in HGC-27 tumorsphere cells in vitro and in vivo but had no significant effect in adherent cells. Finally, we isolated the tumorspheres from gastric cancer specimen, these cells also had chemoresistance and tumorigenic capacity, and SHH pathway maintained the gastric CSLCs characteristics of tumorsphere cells from primary tumor samples. In conclusion, our data suggested that SHH pathway was essential for maintenance of CSLCs in human gastric cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2169960781,"A fundamental characteristic of metazoans is the formation of a simple, polarized epithelium. In higher animals, the structural integrity and functional polarization of simple epithelia require a cell-cell adhesion complex that contains a classical cadherin, the Wnt-signaling protein β-catenin and the actin-binding protein α-catenin. We show that the non-metazoan Dictyostelium discoideum forms a polarized epithelium that is essential for multicellular development. Although D. discoideum lacks a cadherin homolog, we identify an α-catenin ortholog that binds a β-catenin-related protein. Both proteins are essential for formation of the epithelium, polarized protein secretion, and proper multicellular morphogenesis. Thus, the organizational principles of metazoan multicellularity may be more ancient than previously recognized, and the role of the catenins in cell polarity predates the evolution of Wnt signaling and classical cadherins."
https://openalex.org/W2019825211,"The cyclobutadiene (CBD) molecule C(4)H(4) deviates from a high-symmetry square geometry to compensate for its antiaromatic electronic structure. Here, we report a CBD silicon analog, Si(4)(EMind)(4) (1), stabilized by the bulky 1,1,7,7-tetraethyl-3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-s-hydrindacen-4-yl (EMind) groups, obtained as air- and moisture-sensitive orange crystals by the reduction of (EMind)SiBr(3) with three equivalents of lithium naphthalenide. X-ray crystallography reveals a planar and rhombic structure of the Si(4) four-membered ring, with alternating pyramidal and planar configurations at the silicon atoms. The large (29)Si chemical shift differences (Δδ > 350 parts per million) in the solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra suggest a contribution of an alternately charge-separated structure. The rhombic-shaped charge-separated singlet state of compound 1 thus stabilizes its cyclic 4π-electron antiaromaticity in a manner that contrasts sharply with the bond-length alternation, characterizing the rectangular distortion of carbon-based CBD."
https://openalex.org/W2086264753,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine and inflammatory pain. The trigeminal ganglion and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are crucial components in the pathophysiology of primary headaches. 5-HT1B/D receptor agonists, which reduce CGRP release, and cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors can abort trigeminally mediated pain. However, the cellular source of COX and the interplay between COX and CGRP within the trigeminal ganglion have not been clearly identified.1. We used primary cultured rat trigeminal ganglia cells to assess whether IL-1β can induce the expression of COX-2 and which cells express COX-2. Stimulation with IL-1β caused a dose and time dependent induction of COX-2 but not COX-1 mRNA. Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of COX-2 protein in neuronal and glial cells. 2. Functional significance was demonstrated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) release 4 hours after stimulation with IL-1β, which could be aborted by a selective COX-2 (parecoxib) and a non-selective COX-inhibitor (indomethacin). 3. Induction of CGRP release, indicating functional neuronal activation, was seen 1 hour after PGE(2) and 24 hours after IL-1β stimulation. Immunohistochemistry showed trigeminal neurons as the source of CGRP. IL-1β induced CGRP release was blocked by parecoxib and indomethacin, but the 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist sumatriptan had no effect.We identified a COX-2 dependent pathway of cytokine induced CGRP release in trigeminal ganglia neurons that is not affected by 5-HT1B/D receptor activation. Activation of neuronal and glial cells in the trigeminal ganglion by IL-β leads to an elevated expression of COX-2 in these cells. Newly synthesized PGE(2) (by COX-2) in turn activates trigeminal neurons to release CGRP. These findings support a glia-neuron interaction in the trigeminal ganglion and demonstrate a sequential link between COX-2 and CGRP. The results could help to explain the mechanism of action of COX-2 inhibitors in migraine."
https://openalex.org/W1975291766,"T-shaped molecules with a rod-like aromatic core and a flexible side chain form liquid crystal honeycombs with aromatic cell walls and a cell interior filled with the side chains. Here, we show how the addition of a second chain, incompatible with the first (X-shaped molecules), can form honeycombs with highly complex tiling patterns, with cells of up to five different compositions (""colors"") and polygonal shapes. The complexity is caused by the inability of the side chains to separate cleanly because of geometric frustration. Furthermore, a thermoreversible transition was observed between a multicolor (phase-separated) and a single-color (mixed) honeycomb phase. This is analogous to the Curie transition in simple and frustrated ferro- and antiferromagnets; here spin flips are replaced by 180° reorientations of the molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2118281048,"Intrastriatal grafts of stem cell-derived dopamine (DA) neurons induce behavioral recovery in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD), but how they functionally integrate in host neural circuitries is poorly understood. Here, Wnt5a-overexpressing neural stem cells derived from embryonic ventral mesencephalon of tyrosine hydroxylase-GFP transgenic mice were expanded as neurospheres and transplanted into organotypic cultures of wild type mouse striatum. Differentiated GFP-labeled DA neurons in the grafts exhibited mature neuronal properties, including spontaneous firing of action potentials, presence of post-synaptic currents, and functional expression of DA D2 autoreceptors. These properties resembled those recorded from identical cells in acute slices of intrastriatal grafts in the 6-hydroxy-DA-induced mouse PD model and from DA neurons in intact substantia nigra. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of grafted cells and host neurons using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR), respectively, revealed complex, bi-directional synaptic interactions between grafted cells and host neurons and extensive synaptic connectivity within the graft. Our data demonstrate for the first time using optogenetics that ectopically grafted stem cell-derived DA neurons become functionally integrated in the DA-denervated striatum. Further optogenetic dissection of the synaptic wiring between grafted and host neurons will be crucial to clarify the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying behavioral recovery as well as adverse effects following stem cell-based DA cell replacement strategies in PD."

https://openalex.org/W2070889512,"MYC and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-pathway deregulation are common in human prostate cancer. Through examination of 194 human prostate tumors, we observed statistically significant co-occurrence of MYC amplification and PI3K-pathway alteration, raising the possibility that these two lesions cooperate in prostate cancer progression. To investigate this, we generated bigenic mice in which both activated human AKT1 and human MYC are expressed in the prostate (MPAKT/Hi-MYC model). In contrast to mice expressing AKT1 alone (MPAKT model) or MYC alone (Hi-MYC model), the bigenic phenotype demonstrates accelerated progression of mouse prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) to microinvasive disease with disruption of basement membrane, significant stromal remodeling and infiltration of macrophages, B- and T-lymphocytes, similar to inflammation observed in human prostate tumors. In contrast to the reversibility of mPIN lesions in young MPAKT mice after treatment with mTOR inhibitors, Hi-MYC and bigenic MPAKT/Hi-MYC mice were resistant. Additionally, older MPAKT mice showed reduced sensitivity to mTOR inhibition, suggesting that additional genetic events may dampen mTOR dependence. Since increased MYC expression is an early feature of many human prostate cancers, these data have implications for treatment of human prostate cancers with PI3K-pathway alterations using mTOR inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2018580377,"In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human cells, ERO1α and protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) constitute one of the major electron flow pathways that catalyze oxidative folding of secretory proteins. Specific and limited PDI oxidation by ERO1α is essential to avoid ER hyperoxidation. To investigate how ERO1α oxidizes PDI selectively among more than 20 ER-resident PDI family member proteins, we performed docking simulations and systematic biochemical analyses. Our findings reveal that a protruding β-hairpin of ERO1α specifically interacts with the hydrophobic pocket present in the redox-inactive PDI b′-domain through the stacks between their aromatic residues, leading to preferred oxidation of the C-terminal PDI a′-domain. ERO1α associated preferentially with reduced PDI, explaining the stepwise disulfide shuttle mechanism, first from ERO1α to PDI and then from oxidized PDI to an unfolded polypeptide bound to its hydrophobic pocket. The interaction of ERO1α with ERp44, another PDI family member protein, was also analyzed. Notably, ERO1α-dependent PDI oxidation was inhibited by a hyperactive ERp44 mutant that lacks the C-terminal tail concealing the substrate-binding hydrophobic regions. The potential ability of ERp44 to inhibit ERO1α activity may suggest its physiological role in ER redox and protein homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2044186768,"Background The liver stages of malaria parasites are inhibited by cytokines such as interferon-γ or Interleukin (IL)-6. Binding of these cytokines to their receptors at the surface of the infected hepatocytes leads to the production of nitric oxide (NO) and radical oxygen intermediates (ROI), which kill hepatic parasites. However, conflicting results were obtained with TNF-α possibly because of differences in the models used. We have reassessed the role of TNF-α in the different cellular systems used to study the Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages. Methods and Findings Human or mouse TNF-α were tested against human and rodent malaria parasites grown in vitro in human or rodent primary hepatocytes, or in hepatoma cell lines. Our data demonstrated that TNF-α treatment prevents the development of malaria pre-erythrocytic stages. This inhibitory effect however varies with the infecting parasite species and with the nature and origin of the cytokine and hepatocytes. Inhibition was only observed for all parasite species tested when hepatocytes were pre-incubated 24 or 48 hrs before infection and activity was directed only against early hepatic parasite. We further showed that TNF-α inhibition was mediated by a soluble factor present in the supernatant of TNF-α stimulated hepatocytes but it was not related to NO or ROI. Treatment TNF-α prevents the development of human and rodent malaria pre-erythrocytic stages through the activity of a mediator that remains to be identified. Conclusions Treatment TNF-α prevents the development of human and rodent malaria pre-erythrocytic stages through the activity of a mediator that remains to be identified. However, the nature of the cytokine-host cell-parasite combination must be carefully considered for extrapolation to the human infection."
https://openalex.org/W1998243827,"Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule-1 (CEACAM1) is expressed in a variety of cell types and is implicated in carcinogenesis. Alternative splicing of CEACAM1 pre-mRNA generates two cytoplasmic domain splice variants characterized by the inclusion (L-isoform) or exclusion (S-isoform) of exon 7. Here we show that the alternative splicing of CEACAM1 pre-mRNA is regulated by novel cis elements residing in exon 7. We report the presence of three exon regulatory elements that lead to the inclusion or exclusion of exon 7 CEACAM1 mRNA in ZR75 breast cancer cells. Heterologous splicing reporter assays demonstrated that the maintenance of authentic alternative splicing mechanisms were independent of the CEACAM1 intron sequence context. We show that forced expression of these exon regulatory elements could alter CEACAM1 splicing in HEK-293 cells. Using RNA affinity chromatography, three members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family (hnRNP L, hnRNP A1, and hnRNP M) were identified. RNA immunoprecipitation of hnRNP L and hnRNP A1 revealed a binding motif located central and 3' to exon 7, respectively. Depletion of hnRNP A1 or L by RNAi in HEK-293 cells promoted exon 7 inclusion, whereas overexpression led to exclusion of the variable exon. By contrast, overexpression of hnRNP M showed exon 7 inclusion and production of CEACAM1-L mRNA. Finally, stress-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of hnRNP A1 in MDA-MB-468 cells dynamically alters the CEACAM1-S:CEACAM1:L ratio in favor of the l-isoform. Thus, we have elucidated the molecular factors that control the mechanism of splice-site recognition in the alternative splicing regulation of CEACAM1."

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to protect hepatocyte death, but the role of IL-6 in protecting chronic T cell-induced liver diseases is not clearly defined due to lack of relevant animal models. We aimed to define the role of IL-6 in CD8+ T cell-mediated liver injury induced by a CD137 agonistic mAb (clone 2A) in mice.We expressed IL-6 in the liver by hydrodynamic gene delivery in mice treated with 2A or control mAb and studied how IL-6 treatment affected host immunity and T cell-mediated liver injury. We found that ectopic IL-6 expression in the liver elevated intrahepatic leukocyte infiltration but prevented CD8+ T cell-mediated liver injury. In IL-6 treated mice, CD8+ T cells proliferation and IFN-γ expression were inhibited in the liver. We discovered that IL-6 increased accumulation of Gr-1+CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the liver and spleen. These MDSCs had the ability to inhibit T cells proliferation and activation. Finally, we showed that the MDSCs were sufficient and essential for IL-6-mediated protection of anti-CD137 mAb-induced liver injury.We concluded that IL-6 induced Gr-1+CD11b+ MDSCs in the liver to inhibit T cell-mediated liver injury. The findings have defined a novel mechanism of IL-6 in protecting liver from CD8+ T cell-mediated injury."

https://openalex.org/W2043753749,"A poorly understood problem in genetics is how the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus contributes to establishment and maintenance of transcriptional networks. Genetic loci can reside in chromosome “territories” and undergo dynamic changes in subnuclear positioning. Such changes appear to be important for regulating transcription, although many questions remain regarding how loci reversibly transit in and out of their territories and the functional significance of subnuclear transitions. We addressed this issue using GATA-1, a master regulator of hematopoiesis implicated in human leukemogenesis, which often functions with the coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1). In a genetic complementation assay in GATA-1-null cells, GATA-1 expels FOG-1-dependent target genes from the nuclear periphery during erythroid maturation, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We demonstrate that GATA-1 induces extrusion of the β-globin locus away from its chromosome territory at the nuclear periphery, and extrusion precedes the maturation-associated transcriptional surge and morphological transition. FOG-1 and its interactor Mi-2β, a chromatin remodeling factor commonly linked to repression, were required for locus extrusion. Erythroid Krüppel-like factor, a pivotal regulator of erythropoiesis that often co-occupies chromatin with GATA-1, also promoted locus extrusion. Disruption of transcriptional maintenance did not restore the locus subnuclear position that preceded activation. These results lead to a model for how a master developmental regulator relocalizes a locus into a new subnuclear neighborhood that is permissive for high level transcription as an early step in establishing a cell type-specific genetic network.

These results lead to a model for how a master developmental regulator relocalizes a locus into a new subnuclear neighborhood that is permissive for high level transcription as an early step in establishing a cell type-specific genetic network. Alterations in the regulatory milieu can abrogate maintenance without reversion of locus residency back to its original neighborhood. trans-Acting factors establish cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific transcriptional networks as a critical step in the development of multicellular organisms. Many questions remain unanswered regarding how genetic networks are established and maintained. An important parameter is the three-dimensional organization of the cell nucleus, in which chromosomes occupy distinct territories, and regulatory factors reside in specific nuclear bodies that exert specialized functions (1Takizawa T.

The nuclear periphery is commonly associated with transcriptional repression (4Deniaud E. Bickmore W.A. Curr. Opin. Genet.

GATA-1 expels FOG-1-dependent, but not -independent, genes from the nuclear periphery during erythroid maturation (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The finding that only FOG-1-dependent targets relocalize raises intriguing questions. How does a trans-acting factor differentially control subnuclear positioning of distinct members of its target gene ensemble? Is locus repositioning required for, or a consequence of, altered transcription? Studies in diverse systems indicate that genes can reside within or external to their chromosome territory (1Takizawa T. Meaburn K.J. Misteli T. Cell. 2008; 135: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene cluster spanning 3.6 Mb localizes away from its territory in a cell type-specific manner (18Volpi E.V. Chevret E. Jones T. Vatcheva R.

During murine B lymphocyte development, immunoglobulin genes IgH and Igκ reside preferentially at the nuclear periphery in hematopoietic progenitors and pro-T cells, whereas they localize internally in pro-B cells (19Kosak S.T.

Retinoic acid induces activated Hoxb, but not Hoxd, to migrate away from its chromosome territory in mouse embryonic stem cells (20Chambeyron S. Bickmore W.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1119-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The signaling environment can therefore be an important determinant of gene positioning. Although various studies imply important functional consequences of gene positioning, it is challenging to establish causality, and certain results are inconsistent with simple correlations (1Takizawa T. Meaburn K.J. Misteli T. Cell. 2008; 135: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Repositioning of the lymphoid genes Rag and Tdt to centromeric subdomains in primary CD4+8+ T lymphocytes occurs after transcription silencing (21Brown K.E. Baxter J. Graf D. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Approaches to test whether nuclear periphery association instigates repression have involved fusing the Lac repressor to nuclear periphery constituents (lamin B, emerin, and Lap2β) to tether enhanced GFP-containing reporter genes to the nuclear periphery (1Takizawa T. Meaburn K.J. Misteli T. Cell. 2008; 135: 9-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, different modes of manipulating positioning yielded inconsistent conclusions. Although gene movement may be required for transcriptional activity in certain contexts, causality remains debatable, and the molecular underpinnings of how a locus is driven from one subnuclear compartment to another remain to be elucidated. In the context of erythropoiesis, in which billions of red blood cells are generated daily from specific progenitors, the FOG-1-dependent β-globin locus relocalizes from the nuclear periphery to internal sites as primary fetal liver erythroblasts mature (22Ragoczy T. Bender M.A. Telling A. Byron R. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Relocalization correlates with high level transcription but not the transition from an inactive to an active state. Because considerable mechanistic insights have emerged regarding how the β-globin locus is regulated (23Bresnick E.H. Johnson K.D. Kim S.I. Im H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2006; 81: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Dean A. Trends Genet. 2006; 22: 38-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), this system is attractive for dissecting mechanisms of how a trans-acting factor dynamically controls target gene positioning. Using a genetic complementation approach in GATA-1-null cells (25Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26Welch J.J. Watts J.A.

Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 8811-8816Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that GATA-1-induced β-globin locus extrusion from its chromosome territory precedes induction of key markers of erythroid maturation. GATA-1-driven locus movement is therefore not merely a consequence of the surge of transcriptional activity nor of the gross morphological remodeling intrinsic to maturation. Because GATA-1 engages multiple trans-acting factors and coregulators to control hematopoiesis (28Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6777-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 29Bresnick E.H. Lee H.Y. Fujiwara T. Johnson K.D. Keles S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), we assessed whether these factors interface with GATA-1 to drive chromosomal transitions. Finally, because many questions remain unanswered regarding similarities and differences in mechanisms of transcriptional activation versus maintenance, we used a novel paradigm to compare the molecular underpinnings of these processes. In aggregate, the results support a model in which multiple components involved in GATA-1 function exert critical activities to rapidly induce locus extrusion from the respective chromosome territory, yielding a new subnuclear residency site. Abrogating maintenance of transcriptional activity did not restore the locus to its original neighborhood, indicating that establishing the requisite nuclear topography is intrinsic to the process of building a cell type-specific genetic network, although network remodeling can occur independent of gross locus rearrangements. G1E cells expressing ER-GATA-1 (G1E-ER-GATA-1) were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 units/ml erythropoietin, 120 nm monothioglycerol (Sigma), 0.6% conditioned medium from a Kit ligand-producing Chinese hamster ovary cell line, 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini BioProducts), and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). ER-GATA-1 was induced by 1 μm β-estradiol treatment. G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells (3 × 106) were resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector solution R (Amaxa Biosystems) and transfected with 240 pmol of SMARTpool siRNA (Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific). siGenome nontargeting siRNA pool (Dharmacon/Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a control. Cells were transfected twice with the Nucleofector II (Amaxa Biosystems) using the G-016 program, allowing 24 h between transfections, and treated with 1 μm β-estradiol after the second transfection. Cells were harvested 24 h after the second transfection. Protein and RNA were prepared from 1 × 106 and 2 × 106 cells, respectively. For analyses of transcriptional maintenance, cells were treated with β-estradiol, transfected twice after 24 and 36 h of β-estradiol treatment, and harvested 48 h post-treatment. Whole cell lysates were boiled for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, 3% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 5% glycerol). Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were measured by semi-quantitative Western blotting with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Total RNA was purified with TRIzol (Invitrogen) from identical cultures used for Western blotting and FISH analyses. cDNA was prepared by annealing RNA (1 μg) with 250 ng of a 5:1 mixture of random and oligonucleotide (deoxyribosylthymine) primers preheated at 68 °C for 10 min, followed by incubation with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; 50 units) (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphates at 42 °C for 1 h. Reactions were diluted to a final volume of 130 μl and heat-inactivated at 98 °C for 5 min. Reactions (15 μl) contained 2.0 μl of cDNA, 7.5 μl of SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), and appropriate primers. Product was monitored by SYBR Green fluorescence. Control reactions lacking RT yielded little to no signal. Relative expression levels were determined from a standard curve of serial dilutions of cDNA samples and were normalized to Gapdh expression. G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were pretreated with 1 μm β-estradiol for 24 h. Cultures were treated with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (A1410; Sigma) or vehicle for up to 4 h. Total RNA was purified and quantitated by real time RT-PCR analysis. The three-dimensional immuno-FISH assay was conducted as described previously (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were stained with goat anti-lamin B (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 350 (Invitrogen) to detect the nuclear periphery prior to FISH. Biotinylated probes were prepared by nick translation (Roche Applied Science) of BACs obtained from BACPAC resources. The following BACs were used: RP23-370E12 (β-globin), RP24-330L18 (Epb4.9), and RP24-167E18 (Slc4a1); for sites on murine chromosome 7, RP23-238C3 (−28.5 Mb), RP23-368M23 (−25.6 Mb), RP24-232O8 (−5 Mb), RP24-272L15 (−0.8 Mb), RP24-344J7 (−0.3 Mb), RP24-151B23 (−0.1 Mb), RP23-430G11 (+0.6 Mb), RP24-315I4 (+5.5 Mb), RP24-312B10 (+10 Mb), and RP23-447D22 (+18 Mb). Detection of probe was by sequential applications of Rhodamine600 Avidin D (Vector Laboratories), biotinylated goat anti-avidin D (Vector Laboratories) and Rhodamine600 Avidin D. For microscopic analysis, images were captured by Olympus IX81 motorized inverted microscope, in which image stacks were captured from 0.25-μm Z-sections and deconvoluted with Slidebook 5.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.). The image stacks were projected onto a single plane, and the distance of loci from nuclear periphery was measured with Slidebook 5.0 software. Measurements were normalized to nuclear size by dividing the distance by the average radius of the cell nucleus. The nucleus was divided into five concentric shells, each encompassing 20% of the radius. The subnuclear positioning of loci in shells 1–5 was scored. Shell 1 represents the nuclear periphery, and shell 5 represents the center of the nucleus. A minimum of 100–200 loci was scored for each locus. Three-dimensional analyses, in which distances were measured with multiple single optical sections from a single cell, yielded identical conclusions. For statistical analysis, a two-sample binomial test was performed using the statistical software R. The proportion of loci localized at the nuclear periphery (shell 1) and in other nuclear compartments (shells 2–5) in control versus knockdown cells or untreated versus β-estradiol-treated cells was analyzed for statistical significance. To elucidate how trans-acting factors instigate target gene relocalization during development, it is important to derive structural insights into the chromosomal transition. In principle, factors may expel target genes away from the nuclear periphery by repositioning the locus concomitantly with a major component of the chromosome (Fig. 1A, top) or by facilitating a higher order chromosomal transition, allowing for locus extrusion from its chromosome territory without relocalization of major flanking sequences (Fig. 1A, bottom). Although loci can relocalize away from their respective territories, given that GATA-1-induced transcriptional changes are accompanied by massive maturation-associated changes in cell morphology (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it would not be surprising if entire, or major components of, chromosome territories relocalized during maturation. We tested whether GATA-1-dependent expulsion of the FOG-1-dependent β-globin locus from the nuclear periphery is highly restricted to the locus or involves concomitant repositioning of neighboring sequences. To distinguish between models, three-dimensional immuno-FISH was conducted with BAC probes to detect multiple regions of murine chromosome 7 containing the β-globin locus under conditions in which nuclear morphology was preserved. The subnuclear localization of target loci relative to nuclear periphery-associated lamin was quantitated as described (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to yield the percentage of loci localizing at the periphery (outer 20% of the nuclear radius), as well as the inner four shells, each constituting 20% of the radius (Fig. 1B). BACs were used to detect regions −27, −5, −0.8, −0.3, −0.1, +0.6, +5.5, +10, and +18 Mb relative to the β-globin locus (Fig. 1C). The subnuclear localization of these sites was compared with the β-globin locus in uninduced and β-estradiol-treated G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells. The sites analyzed lacked GATA-1-regulated genes, based on transcription profiling and ChIP-seq analyses (30Fujiwara T. O'Geen H. Keles S. Blahnik K. Linnemann A.K. Kang Y.A. Choi K. Farnham P.J. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 667-681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The β-globin locus subnuclear localization was identical to our prior analysis (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), with 40–50% of the loci at the nuclear periphery (shell 1) in immature cells in which ER-GATA-1 is inactive. ER-GATA-1 activation expelled ∼20% of the loci from the periphery (p = 0.007), thereby relocating the loci into internal subnuclear compartments (Fig. 1D). Shell 1 constitutes 36% of the nuclear volume, a greater volume than any of the other four shells. This suggests that ER-GATA-1-mediated expulsion of loci from the periphery reflects the need for loci to escape from regulatory influences imposed by the periphery microenvironment or loci must rendezvous with regulatory factors residing in internal subnuclear compartments. Because genes are often expressed stochastically, with only certain alleles in the cell population active at any given time (31Larson D.R. Singer R.H. Zenklusen D. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 630-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 32Raj A. van Oudenaarden A. Cell. 2008; 135: 216-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar), one would not expect the full complement of loci to relocalize in the genetic complementation assay. We also conducted a double-labeling three-dimensional immuno-FISH assay to detect the β-globin locus (Fig. 1E, red) and +18-Mb site (green) simultaneously. This analysis confirmed that β-estradiol treatment significantly induced expulsion of the β-globin locus from the nuclear periphery (19.5% reduction in shell 1, p = 0.003) without significantly affecting the subnuclear localization of the +18-Mb site (5.5% reduction, p = 0.478) (Fig. 1E). Upon maturation of primary fetal liver erythroblasts, the percentage of β-globin loci associated with the periphery progressively decreased from 66 to 27% (22Ragoczy T. Bender M.A. Telling A. Byron R. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1447-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). All of the other BACs, except the −5-Mb BAC, detected 35–45% of the loci at the periphery pre- and post-ER-GATA-1 activation (Fig. 1D). ER-GATA-1 did not significantly affect the subnuclear localization of any of the other regions of chromosome 7 (Fig. 1D). The topography of these regions was therefore insensitive to ER-GATA-1-induced erythroid maturation. In immature cells, a greater percentage of the −5-Mb loci localized internally versus β-globin, with ∼25% loci residing at the periphery (Fig. 1D). The −5-Mb region was immobile upon maturation (Fig. 1D). As GATA-1-driven β-globin locus repositioning is highly restricted to the locus, independent of major neighboring sequences, the results support a model (Fig. 1A, bottom) in which GATA-1 induces extrusion of FOG-1-dependent target loci from their chromosome territories without measurable repositioning of flanking chromosomal regions. As GATA-1 is essential for erythroid differentiation (33Pevny L. Simon M.C. Robertson E. Klein W.H. Tsai S.F. D'Agati V. Orkin S.H. Costantini F. Nature. 1991; 349: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 34Simon M.C. Pevny L. Wiles M.V. Keller G. Costantini F. Orkin S.H. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), repositioning of GATA-1 target genes might be a consequence of cell maturation and/or the associated transcriptional changes. To address this issue, we conducted kinetic analyses in G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells, systematically monitoring hallmark features of cell maturation, including reduced cell size, reduced nuclear size, and induction of βmajor and Slc4a1 primary transcripts. The kinetics of changes in these parameters were compared with that of β-globin subnuclear relocalization. Cell size and nuclear size progressively decreased concomitant with induction of βmajor transcription during erythroid maturation (Fig. 2A). 40–50% of β-globin loci resided at the nuclear periphery in immature cells, whereas β-estradiol treatment rapidly expelled the loci from the periphery. Treatment of cells with β-estradiol for up to 6 h did not influence the subnuclear positioning of the β-globin locus. Maximal expulsion of the β-globin locus from the nuclear periphery was apparent by 12 h (Fig. 2B). The β-globin locus was expelled from the periphery considerably faster than the morphological remodeling and the surge of βmajor and Slc4a1 transcription coupled with maturation (Fig. 2C). As locus extrusion occurred early during maturation, the extrusion is not likely a consequence of maturation. These results support a model in which locus extrusion is a prerequisite for high level transcription of the β-globin locus and is likely for a large cohort of FOG-1-dependent GATA-1 target genes. Although GATA-1 interacts with a cohort of trans-acting factors and coregulators (29Bresnick E.H. Lee H.Y. Fujiwara T. Johnson K.D. Keles S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), how these factors contribute to GATA-1 function is incompletely understood. GATA-1 regulates target genes through multistep mechanisms (36Kim S.I. Bultman S.J. Jing H. Blobel G.A. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4551-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 37Kim S.I. Bultman S.J. Kiefer C.M. Dean A. Bresnick E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and therefore individual GATA-1 interactors might have dedicated functions at specific steps. We established subnuclear relocalization of target loci as a rapid step in the GATA-1-dependent activation mechanism. To determine whether all or a subset of GATA-1-interacting factors mediate this relocalization, we used an RNAi-based loss-of-function approach to knock down trans-acting factors or coregulators in G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells, and the functional consequences were analyzed vis à vis subnuclear localization and transcription. Because GATA-1 relocalizes FOG-1-dependent genes (5Lee H.Y. Johnson K.D. Fujiwara T. Boyer M.E. Kim S.I. Bresnick E.H. Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 984-995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we asked whether the GATA-1-dependent chromosomal transition requires FOG-1. After introduction of nontargeting control or anti-Fog1 siRNA into G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells, ER-GATA-1 was activated by β-estradiol (Fig. 3A). Fog1 mRNA and protein were greatly reduced by the knockdown (Fig. 3, B and C). The FOG-1 knockdown significantly inhibited β-globin and α-globin loci expulsion from the periphery (p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively) and locus relocalization internally (β-globin: shell 4, p = 0.023; α-globin: shell 3, p = 0.007, shell 4, p = 0.016) (Fig. 3D), and it had a devastating consequence for βmajor transcription (Fig. 3B). By contrast, activated ER-GATA-1 expelled the β-globin locus from the nuclear periphery normally in cells containing control siRNA (Fig. 3D). ER-GATA-1 did not significantly affect Epb4.9 subnuclear positioning (∼50% of loci residing at the periphery) and was insensitive to the FOG-1 knockdown (Fig. 3D). These results reveal an essenti"

However, plants expressing the SP/HrpZPsph showed increased vigor and grew faster in comparison with non-transgenic control plants. Transgenic resistance was assessed after challenge inoculation with BNYVV on T1 progeny by scoring of disease symptoms and by DAS-ELISA at 20 and 30 dpi. Transgenic and control lines showed significant differences in terms of the number of plants that became infected, the timing of infection and the disease symptoms displayed. Plants expressing the SP/HrpZPsph developed localized leaf necrosis in the infection area and had enhanced resistance upon challenge with BNYVV. In order to evaluate the SP/HrpZ-based resistance in the sugar beet host, A. rhizogenes-mediated root transformation was exploited as a transgene expression platform. Upon BNYVV inoculation, transgenic sugar beet hairy roots showed high level of BNYVV resistance. In contrast, the aerial non-transgenic parts of the same seedlings had virus titers that were comparable to those of the seedlings that were untransformed or transformed with wild type R1000 cells. These findings indicate that the transgenically expressed SP/HrpZ protein results in enhanced rhizomania resistance both in a model plant and sugar beet, the natural host of BNYVV. Possible molecular mechanisms underlying the enhanced resistance and plant growth phenotypes observed in SP/HrpZ transgenic plants are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1987516951,"Wilson disease (WD) is a disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutations in the Cu-transporting ATPase ATP7B. WD is characterized by significant phenotypic variability, the molecular basis of which is poorly understood. The E1064A mutation in the N-domain of ATP7B was previously shown to disrupt ATP binding. We have now determined, by NMR, the structure of the N-domain containing this mutation and compared properties of E1064A and H1069Q, another mutant with impaired ATP binding. The E1064A mutation does not change the overall fold of the N-domain. However, the position of the α1,α2-helical hairpin (α-HH) that houses Glu(1064) and His(1069) is altered. The α-HH movement produces a more open structure compared with the wild-type ATP-bound form and misaligns ATP coordinating residues, thus explaining complete loss of ATP binding. In the cell, neither the stability nor targeting of ATP7B-E1064A to the trans-Golgi network differs significantly from the wild type. This is in a contrast to the H1069Q mutation within the same α-HH, which greatly destabilizes protein both in vitro and in cells. The difference between two mutants can be linked to a lower stability of the α-HH in the H1069Q variant at the physiological temperature. We conclude that the structural stability of the N-domain rather than the loss of ATP binding plays a defining role in the ability of ATP7B to reach the trans-Golgi network, thus contributing to phenotypic variability in WD."

Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (Traf)2(-/-) mice spontaneously developed severe colitis and succumbed within 3 weeks after birth. Histological analysis revealed that apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells was enhanced, and B cells diffusely infiltrated into the submucosal layer of the colon of Traf2(-/-) mice. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including Tnfa, Il17a, and Ifng, was up-regulated, whereas expression of antimicrobial peptides was down-regulated in the colon of Traf2(-/-) mice. Moreover, a number of IL-17-producing helper T cells were increased in the colonic lamina propria of Traf2(-/-) mice. These cellular alterations resulted in drastic changes in the colonic microbiota of Traf2(-/-) mice compared with Traf2(+/+) mice. Treatment of Traf2(-/-) mice with antibiotics ameliorated colitis along with down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and prolonged survival, suggesting that the altered colonic microbiota might contribute to exacerbation of colitis. Finally, deletion of Tnfr1, but not Il17a, dramatically ameliorated colitis in Traf2(-/-) mice by preventing apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, down-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, and restoration of wild-type commensal bacteria. Together, TRAF2 plays a crucial role in controlling homeostasis of the colon."
https://openalex.org/W2062211566,"Background Recent molecular genetics studies showed significant associations between dopamine-related genes (including genes for dopamine receptors, transporters, and degradation) and working memory, but little is known about the role of genes for dopamine modulation, such as those related to neurotensin (NT), in working memory. A recent animal study has suggested that NT antagonist administration impaired working memory in a learning task. The current study examined associations between NT genes and working memory among humans. Methods Four hundred and sixty healthy undergraduate students were assessed with a 2-back working memory paradigm. 5 SNPs in the NTSR1 gene were genotyped. 5 ANOVA tests were conducted to examine whether and how working memory differed by NTSR1 genotype, with each SNP variant as the independent variable and the average accuracy on the working memory task as the dependent variable. Results ANOVA results suggested that two SNPs in the NTSR1 gene (rs4334545 and rs6090453) were significantly associated with working memory. These results survived corrections for multiple comparisons. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that NTSR1 SNP polymorphisms were significantly associated with variance in working memory performance among healthy adults. This result extended previous rodent studies showing that the NT deficiency impairs the working memory function. Future research should replicate our findings and extend to an examination of other dopamine modulators."

One of the most frequently reported associations is the presence of recurrent de novo or inherited microdeletions and microduplications on chromosome 16p11.2. The analysis of rare variations of 8 candidate genes among the 27 genes located in this region suggested SEZ6L2 as a compelling candidate.We further explored the role of SEZ6L2 variations by screening its coding part in a group of 452 individuals, including 170 patients with ASD and 282 individuals from different ethnic backgrounds of the Human Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP), complementing the previously reported screening. We detected 7 previously unidentified non-synonymous variations of SEZ6L2 in ASD patients. We also identified 6 non-synonymous variations present only in HGDP. When we merged our results with the previously published, no enrichment of non-synonymous variation in SEZ6L2 was observed in the ASD group compared with controls.Our results provide an extensive ascertainment of the genetic variability of SEZ6L2 in human populations and do not support a major role for SEZ6L2 sequence variations in the susceptibility to ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2050806368,"Background The myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) gene family is broadly expressed during the development and maintenance of muscle cells. Although a great deal has been elucidated concerning MEF2 transcription factors' regulation of specific gene expression in diverse programs and adaptive responses, little is known about the origin and evolution of the four members of the MEF2 gene family in vertebrates. Methodology/Principal Findings By phylogenetic analyses, we investigated the origin, conservation, and evolution of the four MEF2 genes. First, among the four MEF2 paralogous branches, MEF2B is clearly distant from the other three branches in vertebrates, mainly because it lacks the HJURP_C (Holliday junction recognition protein C-terminal) region. Second, three duplication events might have occurred to produce the four MEF2 paralogous genes and the latest duplication event occurred near the origin of vertebrates producing MEF2A and MEF2C. Third, the ratio (Ka/Ks) of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates showed that MEF2B evolves faster than the other three MEF2 proteins despite purifying selection on all of the four MEF2 branches. Moreover, a pair model of M0 versus M3 showed that variable selection exists among MEF2 proteins, and branch-site analysis presented that sites 53 and 64 along the MEF2B branch are under positive selection. Finally, and interestingly, substitution rates showed that type II MADS genes (i.e., MEF2-like genes) evolve as slowly as type I MADS genes (i.e., SRF-like genes) in animals, which is inconsistent with the fact that type II MADS genes evolve much slower than type I MADS genes in plants. Conclusion Our findings shed light on the relationship of MEF2A, B, C, and D with functional conservation and evolution in vertebrates. This study provides a rationale for future experimental design to investigate distinct but overlapping regulatory roles of the four MEF2 genes in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2030788364,"A very small proportion of people remain negative for HIV infection after repeated HIV-1 viral exposure, which is called HIV-1 resistance. Understanding the mechanism of HIV-1 resistance is important for the development of HIV-1 vaccines and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) therapies. In this study, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of CD4+ T cells from HIV-1-resistant individuals and HIV-susceptible individuals. One hundred eighty-five discriminative HIV-1 resistance genes were identified using the Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) methods. The virus protein target enrichment analysis of the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes suggested that the HIV-1 protein nef might play an important role in HIV-1 infection. Moreover, we identified 29 infection information exchanger genes from the 185 HIV-1 resistance genes based on a virus-host interaction network analysis. The infection information exchanger genes are located on the shortest paths between virus-targeted proteins and are important for the coordination of virus infection. These proteins may be useful targets for AIDS prevention or therapy, as intervention in these pathways could disrupt communication with virus-targeted proteins and HIV-1 infection."

https://openalex.org/W1983300146,"Background Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic fossils of ancient retroviral integrations that remain in the genome of many organisms. Most loci are rendered non-functional by mutations, but several intact retroviral genes are known in mammalian genomes. Some have been adopted by the host species, while the beneficial roles of others remain unclear. Besides the obvious possible immunogenic impact from transcribing intact viral genes, endogenous retroviruses have also become an interesting and useful tool to study phylogenetic relationships. The determination of the integration time of these viruses has been based upon the assumption that both 5′ and 3′ Long Terminal Repeats (LTRs) sequences are identical at the time of integration, but evolve separately afterwards. Similar approaches have been using either a constant evolutionary rate or a range of rates for these viral loci, and only single species data. Here we show the advantages of using different approaches. Results We show that there are strong advantages in using multiple species data and state-of-the-art phylogenetic analysis. We incorporate both simple phylogenetic information and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods to date the integrations of these viruses based on a relaxed molecular clock approach over a Bayesian phylogeny model and applied them to several selected ERV sequences in primates. These methods treat each ERV locus as having a distinct evolutionary rate for each LTR, and make use of consensual speciation time intervals between primates to calibrate the relaxed molecular clocks. Conclusions The use of a fixed rate produces results that vary considerably with ERV family and the actual evolutionary rate of the sequence, and should be avoided whenever multi-species phylogenetic data are available. For genome-wide studies, the simple phylogenetic approach constitutes a better alternative, while still being computationally feasible."

Published evidence suggests that the mechanisms through which HN exerts its cyto- and neuroprotective activity may include its secretion and binding to membrane-associated receptors. Here, we describe the identification of a new modulator of HN neuroprotective activity, V-set and transmembrane domain containing 2 like (VSTM2L), previously known as C20orf102. VSTM2L interacts with HN in both yeast and mammalian cells, is secreted in cultured cells, is present in serum, and is selectively expressed in the central nervous system. VSTM2L colocalizes with HN in distinct brain areas as well as in primary cultured neurons, where it plays a role in the modulation of neuronal viability. When tested in HN neuroprotection bioassays, VSTM2L acts as a strong antagonist of HN neuroprotective activity. In summary, VSTM2L is the first example of a secreted antagonist of HN and may play a role in the modulation of HN biological functions."

https://openalex.org/W2053186969,"Exposure to perchlorate is ubiquitous in the United States and has been found to be widespread in food and drinking water. People living in the lower Colorado River region may have perchlorate exposure because of perchlorate in ground water and locally-grown produce. Relatively high doses of perchlorate can inhibit iodine uptake and impair thyroid function, and thus could impair neurological development in utero. We examined human exposures to perchlorate in the Imperial Valley among individuals consuming locally grown produce and compared perchlorate exposure doses to state and federal reference doses. We collected 24-hour urine specimen from a convenience sample of 31 individuals and measured urinary excretion rates of perchlorate, thiocyanate, nitrate, and iodide. In addition, drinking water and local produce were also sampled for perchlorate. All but two of the water samples tested negative for perchlorate. Perchlorate levels in 79 produce samples ranged from non-detect to 1816 ppb. Estimated perchlorate doses ranged from 0.02 to 0.51 µg/kg of body weight/day. Perchlorate dose increased with the number of servings of dairy products consumed and with estimated perchlorate levels in produce consumed. The geometric mean perchlorate dose was 70% higher than for the NHANES reference population. Our sample of 31 Imperial Valley residents had higher perchlorate dose levels compared with national reference ranges. Although none of our exposure estimates exceeded the U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2032804864,"The regulatory subunit (R) of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is a modular flexible protein that responds with large conformational changes to the binding of the effector cAMP. Considering its highly dynamic nature, the protein is rather stable. We studied the thermal denaturation of full-length RIα and a truncated RIα(92-381) that contains the tandem cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domains A and B.As revealed by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry, both RIα proteins contain significant residual structure in the heat-denatured state. As evidenced by CD, the predominantly α-helical spectrum at 25°C with double negative peaks at 209 and 222 nm changes to a spectrum with a single negative peak at 212-216 nm, characteristic of β-structure. A similar α→β transition occurs at higher temperature in the presence of cAMP. Thioflavin T fluorescence and atomic force microscopy studies support the notion that the structural transition is associated with cross-β-intermolecular aggregation and formation of non-fibrillar oligomers.Thermal denaturation of RIα leads to partial loss of native packing with exposure of aggregation-prone motifs, such as the B' helices in the phosphate-binding cassettes of both CNB domains. The topology of the β-sandwiches in these domains favors inter-molecular β-aggregation, which is suppressed in the ligand-bound states of RIα under physiological conditions. Moreover, our results reveal that the CNB domains persist as structural cores through heat-denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W2076977567,"In the visual signal terminating transition state, the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) inhibitory γ-subunit (PDEγ) stimulates GTPase activity of the α-subunit of transducin (αt) by enhancing the interaction between αt and its regulator of G protein signaling (RGS9), which is constitutively bound to the type 5 G protein β-subunit (β5). Although it is known from a crystal structure of partial molecules that the PDEγ C terminus contacts with both αt and RGS9, contributions from the intrinsically disordered PDEγ N-terminal half remain unclear. In this study, we were able to investigate this issue using a photolabel transfer strategy that allows for mapping the interface of full-length proteins. We observed label transfer from PDEγ N-terminal positions 50, 30, and 16 to RGS9·β5 in the GTPase-accelerating protein (GAP) complex composed of PDEγ·αt·RGS9·β5. In support of a direct PDEγ N-terminal interaction with RGS9·β5, the PDEγ N-terminal peptide PDEγ(1-61) abolished label transfer to RGS9·β5, and another N-terminal peptide, PDEγ(10-30), disassembled the GAP complex in label transfer and pulldown experiments. Furthermore, we determined that the PDEγ C-terminal interaction with αt was enhanced whereas the N-terminal interaction was weakened upon changing the αt conformation from the signaling state to the transition state. This ""rearrangement"" of PDEγ domain interactions with αt appears to facilitate the interaction of the PDEγ N-terminal half with RGS9·β5 and hence its contribution to optimal stabilization of the GAP complex."
https://openalex.org/W2121255997,"The RNA oligo(U) sequence, along with an immediately preceding RNA hairpin structure, is an essential cis-acting element for bacterial class I intrinsic termination. This sequence not only causes a pause in transcription during the beginning of the termination process but also facilitates transcript release at the end of the process. In this study, the oligo(U) sequence of the bacteriophage T7 intrinsic terminator Tϕ, rather than the hairpin structure, induced pauses of phage T7 RNA polymerase not only at the termination site, triggering a termination process, but also 3 bp upstream, exerting an antitermination effect. The upstream pause presumably allowed RNA to form a thermodynamically more stable secondary structure rather than a terminator hairpin and to persist because the 5′-half of the terminator hairpin-forming sequence could be sequestered by a farther upstream sequence via sequence-specific hybridization, prohibiting formation of the terminator hairpin and termination. The putative antiterminator RNA structure lacked several base pairs essential for termination when probed using RNases A, T1, and V1. When the antiterminator was destabilized by incorporation of IMP into nascent RNA at G residue positions, antitermination was abolished. Furthermore, antitermination strength increased with more stable antiterminator secondary structures and longer pauses.

The most common class of intrinsic (factor-independent) termination signal relies on an oligo(U) sequence in the RNA preceded by an RNA hairpin structure (class I intrinsic termination signal) (3d'Aubenton Carafa Y. Brody E. Thermes C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 835-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The termination mechanism of class I signals is shared by virtually all multisubunit bacterial and single-subunit phage RNA polymerases. However, it is distinct from the mechanism of class II intrinsic termination, which is caused by specific DNA sequence recognition of single-subunit phage T7 RNA polymerase (4Sohn Y. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The oligo(U) sequence allows ECs to pause prior to the release of RNA transcripts (5Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol.

This transcription pause has been shown to be the first signal for the class I termination pathway, providing additional time for the formation of a terminator RNA hairpin that opens or unwinds the RNA-DNA hybrid at an upstream region, shortening and weakening the hybrid (5Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Epshtein V. Cardinale C.J. Ruckenstein A.E. Borukhov S. Nudler E. Mol.

Because the remaining downstream part of the hybridized region consists mostly of rU:dA base pairs, it becomes thermodynamically unstable, facilitating the release of nascent RNA transcripts (9Martin F.H. Tinoco Jr., I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2295-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In this study, an opposite effect of the oligo(U)-mediated pause was found with a typical class I signal of T7 terminator Tϕ for T7 RNA polymerase (see Fig. 1). The oligo(U) sequence of this terminator induces a pause not only at the termination site (referred to hereafter as position T) but also at a position 3 bp upstream (position T-3). Although the pause at position T facilitates termination, the pause at position T-3 exerts an antitermination activity on the complex. In many of the antitermination mechanisms of class I intrinsic termination, regulatory factors interact with RNA polymerase to convert the transcription complex into a termination-resistant form. For example, phage λ-encoded N protein interacts with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, exerting an antitermination effect on nutL and nutR terminators of the phage λ genome (1Nudler E. Gottesman M.E. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In other examples, RNA polymerase interacts with a product transcript rather than an external factor; hence, the antitermination is intrinsic, requiring no external factors, such as the antitermination at the phage HK022 put operon leader (10King R.A. Banik-Maiti S. Jin D.J. Weisberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, in other antitermination mechanisms, antitermination factors interact with transcript RNA rather than RNA polymerase to alter RNA secondary structure. For example, tiny abortive initiation transcript RNAs (11Lee S. Nguyen H.M. Kang C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6045-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or uncharged tRNAs (12Henkin T.M.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11121-11126Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) interact with transcript RNA, interfering with terminator hairpin formation and exerting antitermination effects on phage T7 terminator Tϕ and on the Bacillus subtilis terminator of the T box gene family, respectively. Rather than involving an alteration in RNA polymerase conformation, the antitermination mechanism described in this study appears to involve an alteration in transcript RNA secondary structure that prevents the formation of the terminator hairpin structure. This antitermination is made possible by a transcription pause prior to the termination site and does not require an external regulatory factor. In this intrinsic antitermination, the causal pause associates with the oligo(U) sequence, which is also responsible for causing another pause and termination at the termination site. We suggest that the oligo(U)-induced pause could be an antitermination signal as well as a termination signal, depending on the RNA secondary structures that are formed during the pauses. The pET3 plasmid contained T7 promoter ϕ10 and terminator Tϕ (14Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar).

Several plasmids with variations in Tϕ were additionally constructed by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pKM01.

EC with 15-mer RNA stalled at position T-77 (i.e. 77 bp upstream of the termination site) was obtained by incubating the linear biotinylated KM01 template (125 nm) bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Invitrogen) in a 160-μl reaction containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP, 500 μm GTP, 50 μm CTP, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), and 2000 units of T7 RNA polymerase at room temperature for 20 min (15Sohn Y. Shen H. Kang C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). EC at position T-77 was advanced to position T-74 in a walking reaction using 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences); after washing, the radiolabeled EC was farther advanced to the desired downstream positions by repetition of washing and incubation in 160 μl of transcription buffer containing 0.5 μm rNTPs required for the next walking step. For incorporation of IMP into RNA transcripts, ECs were incubated with 5 μm ITP (Ambion). EC stalled at a particular position was incubated in a 20-μl solution of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm rNTPs, and 4 units of RNasin at room temperature for various amounts of time, and the incubation was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of gel loading buffer (12 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) prewarmed at 65 °C. After being heated at 95 °C for 5 min, reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 8 m urea-12% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and scanned using a phosphorimaging analyzer (Fuji BAS 3000), and band intensities were quantified using TINA 2.0 software. For structure probing, the terminator and antiterminator RNAs were synthesized and labeled by incubating 10 pmol of a DNA template as described above in a 200-μl reaction containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm ATP, 500 μm GTP, 500 μm CTP, 100 units of T7 RNA polymerase, and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C for 4 h. DNA templates were obtained by PCRs of pKM01 using 5′-CGGCGTAGAGGATCGAGA-3′ as the forward primer and 5′-CAAGACCCGTTTAGAGGCCC-3′ (for an EC pausing at position T-3) or 5′-CCTCAAGACCCGTTTAGAGG-3′ (for an EC pausing at position T) as the reverse primer and were digested by DNase I (Takara), followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Synthesized RNAs were refolded by heating in RNA structure buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7), 100 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) at 95 °C for 2 min, followed by cooling to room temperature for 1 h. For enzymatic cleavage, radioactive RNA (5 nCi) was incubated at room temperature with RNase A, T1, or V1 (Ambion) for 15 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of inactivation buffer (Ambion), followed by ethanol precipitation. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea. RNA was denatured and digested by RNase T1 to produce G ladders and then boiled in an alkaline buffer (50 mm NaOH and 10 mm EDTA) for 5 min to make all ladders. An oligo(U) sequence is immediately adjacent to the 3′-terminal G residue in most of the RNA terminated at phage T7 terminator Tϕ by T7 RNA polymerase (Fig. 1) (16Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 2119-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17McAllister W.T. Morris C. Rosenberg A.H. Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 153: 527-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To study the pattern of transcription pausing in Tϕ, we monitored transcription reactions of a template with Tϕ in a time course manner. Elongation paused for several seconds at two positions, T-3 and T (Fig. 2A). In a modified template with substitutions that disrupt the terminator hairpin, elongation still paused at both positions (Fig. 2A). In contrast, both pauses disappeared in a broken oligo(U) variant (Fig. 2A). Thus, the transcription pauses at positions T-3 and T were caused by oligo(U) rather than by RNA hairpin. Although the T-3 pause was caused by oligo(U), a causal element for termination, quantitative analysis of the results of time course elongation on the wild-type template showed that it associated with read-through rather than termination (Fig. 2, B and C). After reaching a peak at 4 or 5 s, the amount of the T-3 pause complex decreased by 22% during the next 2-s period (from 5 to 7 s). During the same period, the amount of read-through complexes increased by 28%, but that of terminated complexes increased by only 7%. Accordingly, read-through complexes rather than terminated complexes appeared to emerge in a reciprocal manner as the T-3 pause complexes diminished. When time course transcriptions were repeated at a lower NTP concentration (10 μm), it was also observed that read-through complexes emerged in a reciprocal manner as the pause complexes diminished (Fig. 2, D and E). From 16 to 31 s, the pause decreased by 31%, and read-through increased by 41%, although termination increased by only 4%. When the NTP concentration was increased to 250 μm, the T-3 pause reached a lower maximum peak (5% at 2 s), and subsequently, a lower plateau of read-through (30%) was achieved than at 50 or 10 μm NTP. Comparison of the data obtained at the three different NTP concentrations revealed a high correlation (r = 0.89) between the T-3 pause strength and the final read-through efficiency. The read-through efficiency was 30, 40, and 68% when the maximum pause was 5, 28, and 39%, respectively (as measured at 250, 50, and 10 μm NTP, respectively). Thus, the more strongly a pause occurred at position T-3, the more frequently a read-through occurred at position T. These results suggest that the pause at position T-3 facilitates read-through at position T rather than termination, whereas the pause at position T facilitates termination. To confirm the finding that the T-3 pause facilitates read-through, the pause was prolonged by stalling ECs in transcription reactions that lacked a specific NTP before resuming elongation with supplementation of the NTP. Stalled complexes could be isolated on biotinylated templates using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (15Sohn Y. Shen H. Kang C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and stalling could be induced virtually at any position of the template for any length of time in this way. When ECs were stalled at position T-3 for varying periods of time on a modified template in which an A residue had been substituted for the T-2 residue, breaking the oligo(T) stretch (this substitution decreased termination efficiency to 57%), termination occurred less frequently as the duration of stalling increased (Fig. 3A). When ECs were stalled briefly (for 5 min) at varied positions of the wild-type template before being chased with 50 μm NTP, termination efficiency was decreased upon stalling at position T-12, T-11, or T-7 (Fig. 3B). However, brief stalling at positions between T-33 and T-13 had little effect on termination efficiency. These experiments were repeated with stalling at various positions for varied durations (Fig. 3C). For reactions in which stalling occurred at positions between T-12 and T-3, termination efficiency exponentially decreased with increasing duration of stalling. In contrast, stalling at position T enhanced the termination efficiency, consistent with previous observations (5Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Stalling at positions between T-17 and T-13 reduced termination efficiency only a bit, regardless of the duration of stalling. Thus, upstream stalling facilitated read-through at position T more effectively when it was longer or closer to position T, but it was effective only with stalling at positions between T-12 and T-3. A much shorter or weaker pause than stalling can be induced by lowering the concentration of an NTP(s) instead of completely removing it. According to previous studies, elongation slowed down and termination increased with lower concentrations of NTPs (18Reynolds R. Bermúdez-Cruz R.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 31-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 19Farnham P.J. Greenblatt J. Platt T. Cell. 1982; 29: 945-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found here that lowering specific NTP concentrations decreased termination efficiency. After stalling at position T-17, which, as described above, did not affect termination efficiency, ECs were chased with NTPs in which the GTP concentration was varied from 5 pm to 500 μm (Fig. 3D). In the wild-type template, GTP was required at positions T-12, T-10, T-9, T-8, T-7, and T, among other positions (Fig. 1); for this experiment, the G residue at position T was replaced with a T residue (this substitution did not affect termination efficiency) to remove the effect of slowing down the extension from position T-1 to T. When the GTP concentration was lowered from 5 nm (Fig. 3D, lane 7) to 5 pm (lane 10), termination was dramatically reduced from 76 to 28%. In similar experiments using other template variants, termination was suppressed by lowering the concentration of the NTP required at positions T-11, T-4, and T-3 (data not shown). Accordingly, slowing down the elongation at positions from T-13 to T-3 resulted in enhanced read-through at position T rather than termination. Two explanations can be conceived for the finding that upstream pausing facilitates read-through rather than termination. The first is that termination-prone complexes are selectively destabilized during the upstream pause, resulting in increased relative amounts of read-through complexes. The second is that the conformation of the nascent RNA in the complex is changed to a read-through-favorable form during the upstream pause. To test the first possibility, the stability of stalled ECs was examined as described previously (4Sohn Y. Kang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ECs stalled at a position from T-7 to T-1 were obtained using a modified template with a broken oligo(T) sequence, and aliquots of the reaction were incubated at room temperature for 0–120 min. The ECs, which contained biotinylated DNA, were purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and their radioactive RNA transcripts were measured after gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4A). When RNA transcripts dissociate from ECs or when binary complexes of polymerase-RNA are released from biotinylated DNA during the incubation, a reduction in radioactivity will be seen. In this assay, the stability of diverse ECs was measured in a time course manner. A dramatic reduction in radioactive RNA was observed with ECs isolated after stalling at position T-2 or T-1; after 20 min of incubation, only ∼20% remained (Fig. 4B). In contrast, ECs collected after stalling at position T-3 or upstream were stable. For example, 77% of the T-3 ECs remained even after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 4B). Accordingly, the enhanced read-through after pausing at position T-3 (or any position between T-12 and T-3) was probably caused by structural change rather than by dissociation of ECs. To uncover the structural difference in the EC related to the two pauses at positions T and T-3 that exert opposite effects on Tϕ, the RNA secondary structures were estimated by the mfold program for each pause complex (20Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10412) Google Scholar). We assumed that 9 residues at the 3′-end (from positions T-8 to T) cannot participate in the formation of a secondary structure because 7 or 8 residues at the 3′-end are engaged in an RNA-DNA hybrid (21Huang J. Sousa R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Tahirov T.H. Temiakov D. Anikin M. Patlan V. McAllister W.T. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the 9th residue from the 3′-end is in contact with T7 RNA polymerase (23Temiakov D. Mentesana P.E. Ma K. Mustaev A. Borukhov S. McAllister W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 14109-14114Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Shen H. Kang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4080-4084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). A stable terminator hairpin structure with an 11-bp stem (ΔG = −14.8 kcal/mol) was estimated for the T pause complex (Fig. 5A). In the T-3 pause complex, an alternative secondary structure (ΔG = −17.4 kcal/mol) (Fig. 5B) was predicted, and the 5′-half of the terminator hairpin-forming sequence hybridized with a farther upstream sequence. This structure is incapable of inducing termination because it is located 16 nucleotides distant from oligo(U). If this antiterminator RNA structure persists at position T, the terminator hairpin close to oligo(U) cannot be formed efficiently, and antitermination would occur at Tϕ. The prediction of RNA secondary structures was checked by enzymatic probing assays using three structure-specific endonucleases. Two RNA molecules radioactively labeled at the 5′-end were synthesized in multiround transcription reactions using [γ-32P]GTP to represent the terminator and antiterminator RNA structures formed in nascent transcripts. The terminator RNA was produced to match the 83-nucleotide sequence from positions T-91 to T-9, and the antiterminator RNA to match the 80-nucleotide sequence from positions T-91 to T-12. The radioactive transcripts were subjected to partial digestion with RNases A, T1 and V1 separately. Cleavage sites revealed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5, C and D) were consistent with the expectations made from the predicted secondary structures, except for cleavage between the 2 bp at the extreme bottom of the antiterminator stem by RNase A, which cleaves the 3′-side of unpaired U or C residues, likely due to breathing of RNA (Fig. 5, A and B). The best distinction between the terminator and antiterminator structures was observed with the 5′-GGGU-3′ sequence at positions T-19 to T-16 (boldface in Fig. 5, A and B), the base pairing of which has been demonstrated to be essential for termination (11Lee S. Nguyen H.M. Kang C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6045-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It was cleaved well by RNase T1, which cleaves the 3′-side of unpaired G residues, and by RNase A but not by RNase V1 in the antiterminator RNA (Fig. 5B). The same sequence was not cleaved by RNase A or T1 but was cleaved by RNase V1 in the terminator RNA (Fig. 5A), although RNase V1 cleaves stacked unpaired residues as well as paired residues at the 5′-side (25Lowman H.B. Draper D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5396-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the hypothesis that stable antiterminator RNA structure at position T-3 causes antitermination, termination efficiency was measured under conditions in which formation of the antiterminator structure was blocked or made inefficient. Incorporation of IMP into RNA transcripts at G residue positions destabilizes RNA secondary structures by reducing the number of hydrogen bonds (26SantaLucia Jr., J. Kierzek R. Turner D.H. Science. 1992; 256: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). IMP incorporation at 12 G residue positions from T-66 to T-29 (circled in Fig. 5B) would disrupt the antiterminator RNA structure of Fig. 5B, allowing the terminator hairpin structure of Fig. 5A to be formed. When ECs were stalled at position T-3 after IMP incorporation at the 12 positions, termination efficiency was consistently high regardless of how long the complexes had been stalled (Fig. 6A), unlike in the case of normal GMP incorporation (Fig. 3A). When ECs were stalled briefly at other upstream positions, termination efficiency was high (Fig. 6B), unlike in the GMP incorporation case (Fig. 3B). Thus, antitermination was not observed when the secondary structure shown in Fig. 5B could not be formed. Accordingly, the antiterminator RNA structure formed with the sequence from positions T-68 to T-50 was responsible for the cis-acting antitermination activity of Tϕ. To verify the hypothesis that the termination-interfering RNA secondary structure is responsible for the cis-acting antitermination of Tϕ, the correlation between stability of the antiterminator structure and antitermination strength was examined. Several antiterminator structures of varied ΔG values were designed by substitution mutations (Fig. 7A). First, the A and T residues at positions T-62 and T-61 were exchanged with G residues, generating a more stable structure (S-AT RNA) with ΔG = −26.5 kcal/mol. Second, two G residues at positions T-64 and T-63 were replaced with A residues, producing a less stable structure (W-AT RNA) with ΔG = −10.3 kcal/mol. When termination efficiencies were measured at 0.1 mm NTP using these modified templates, there was a positive linear correlation (r = 0.99) between termination efficiency and the estimated ΔG value of the RNA secondary structure (Fig. 7B, solid line). Thus, antitermination strength depended on the thermodynamic stability of the antiterminator RNA secondary structure. A linear correlation (r = 0.99) was also observed when transcription reactions were carried out at 50-fold higher NTP concentration, 5 mm (Fig. 7B, dotted line). The antitermination strength was lower in 5 mm NTP than in 0.1 mm NTP; this can be explained by the fact that because the T-3 pause is shortened at higher NTP concentrations, there is insufficient time for formation of antiterminator structure. Accordingly, for cis-acting antitermination to occur, the pause must be long enough, and the antiterminator RNA structure must be sufficiently stable. In this study, we found for the first time that in addition to facilitating termination by causing a pause at the termination site, RNA oligo(U) can induce antitermination on an RNA hairpin-dependent intrinsic terminator (class I) by provoking a transcription pause at a position upstream of the termination site. Because the antitermination pause precedes the termination pause, termination efficiency would be expected to depend primarily on the antitermination strength. This phenomenon could explain, at least in part, why termination efficiency is not strictly correlated with stability of the terminator hairpin and is affected by some changes in the upstream nucleotide sequence outside of a class I termination signal (27Larson M.H. Greenleaf W.J. Landick R. Block S.M. Cell. 2008; 132: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Lee J.T. Kim H. Kang C. Mol. Cells. 1991; 1: 203-209Google Scholar). Transcription pausing can be induced or modulated by various signals, including RNA secondary structure, regulatory proteins, backtracking of ECs, certain downstream DNA sequences, and others (6Landick R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 29Artsimovitch I. Landick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7090-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The RNA oligo(U) portion of class I termination signals has been well documented to make a transcription pause at the termination site (position T), triggering a termination process. The termination pause allows formation of an RNA hairpin that shortens or destabilizes the RNA-DNA hybrid and/or alters RNA polymerase conformation to facilitate release of RNA (5Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 8Komissarova N. Becker J. Solter S. Kireeva M. Kashlev M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It was confirmed in this study that the termination pause is caused by oligo(U) rather than by hairpin formation in terminator Tϕ RNA (Fig. 2A) and that strengthening the pause at position T stimulates termination (Fig. 3C). In this study, we also found that the same oligo(U) can induce another pause 3 bp upstream, i.e. at position T-3 (Fig. 2A), and that the consequence of this upstream pause is opposite, stimulating read-through rather than termination at position T (Fig. 3A). This intrinsic antitermination, which requires no external factor, is presumably rendered by formation of an antiterminator RNA structure in which a farther upstream sequence sequesters the 5′-half of the terminator hairpin-forming sequence (Fig. 5B) to prevent formation of the terminator hairpin structure. In this mode of intrinsic antitermination, the antitermination strength and the resulting termination efficiency will be determined by the formation and persistence of antiterminator secondary structure(s) over the terminator hairpin across position T. The persistence apparently depends on two parameters. First, the antitermination efficiency was positively linearly correlated with the stability (ΔG values) of antiterminator RNA secondary structure (Fig. 6B). Second, increasing the pause duration at position T-3 enhanced the antitermination efficiency (Fig. 3C), whereas decreasing the pause strength at a higher NTP concentration reduced the antitermination efficiency (Fig. 7B). Accordingly, both a sufficiently long pause and stable antiterminator RNA structure are required for the pause-mediated cis-acting antitermination. In this study, we did not examine whether this pause-mediated antitermination has any biological relevance or even whether it is effective in vivo, other than the fact that ∼195 nucleotides upstream of this terminator are not translated, and no interference of ribosome is expected. However, this question must be considered because a transcription pause has been observed a little ahead of the termination site with many intrinsic terminators in vitro, and such pauses have been presumed to associate with termination events (30Song H. Kang C. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Lyakhov D.L. He B. Zhang X. Studier F.W. Dunn J.J. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, an E. coli RNA polymerase transcription pause occurring 2 bp upstream of the termination site (position T-2) has been observed with the phage λ tR2 intrinsic terminator at low ATP concentrations (32Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); the biochemical properties of this pause complex have been regarded as part of the intrinsic termination mechanism (5Gusarov I. Nudler E. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, like the T-3 pause complex of Tϕ described in this study, the T-2 pause complex of tR2 would be more likely to result in read-through rather than termination, although the former was with T7 RNA polymerase and the latter with E. coli RNA polymerase. This is supported by a previous finding that tR2 termination efficiency was reduced at lower ATP concentrations (32Wilson K.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ΔG value for the tR2 terminator hairpin is estimated to be −10.1 kcal/mol (Fig. 8A) by the mfold program. In the T-2 pause complex with an 8-bp RNA-DNA hybrid (33Nudler E. Mustaev A. Lukhtanov E. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1997; 89: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), however, the hairpin would be shorter, with ΔG = −3.7 kcal/mol (Fig. 8B), which is much less stable than an alternatively formed antiterminator structure with ΔG = −10.1 kcal/mol (Fig. 8C). Thus, a pause upstream of the termination site should not be presumed to associate with termination without further characterization. This intrinsic antitermination activity mediated by transcription pausing is distinct from the recently reported antitermination activity that is exerted by tiny abortive initiation transcripts (11Lee S. Nguyen H.M. Kang C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 6045-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), although both antitermination mechanisms were found for the T7 Tϕ terminator and T7 RNA polymerase. Antiterminator abortive transcripts are produced from some T7 promoters and interfere with formation of the terminator hairpin in a trans-acting manner, and therefore, the trans-antitermination strength increases over multiple rounds of transcription. In contrast, the pause mediates antitermination in a cis-acting manner and is effective even in single-round transcription that is experimentally performed after transcription ternary complexes are separated from all released products, including abortive initiation transcripts. In this study, termination efficiency was measured only in single-round transcription reactions and was therefore not compounded by trans-antitermination. In summary, an oligo(U) that can induce a pause at the termination site to trigger a termination process on RNA hairpin-dependent intrinsic terminators can induce another pause upstream, which can exert antitermination on the same terminator. Thus, transcription pausing can induce either termination or antitermination depending on the subsequent RNA folding.
