https://openalex.org/W1859117663,"Mammalian genomes are organized into megabase-scale topologically associated domains (TADs). We demonstrate that disruption of TADs can rewire long-range regulatory architecture and result in pathogenic phenotypes. We show that distinct human limb malformations are caused by deletions, inversions, or duplications altering the structure of the TAD-spanning WNT6/IHH/EPHA4/PAX3 locus. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing, we generated mice with corresponding rearrangements. Both in mouse limb tissue and patient-derived fibroblasts, disease-relevant structural changes cause ectopic interactions between promoters and non-coding DNA, and a cluster of limb enhancers normally associated with Epha4 is misplaced relative to TAD boundaries and drives ectopic limb expression of another gene in the locus. This rewiring occurred only if the variant disrupted a CTCF-associated boundary domain. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome."
https://openalex.org/W1635615463,"CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology holds great promise for discovering therapeutic targets in cancer and other diseases. Current screening strategies target CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutations to the 5' exons of candidate genes, but this approach often produces in-frame variants that retain functionality, which can obscure even strong genetic dependencies. Here we overcome this limitation by targeting CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to exons encoding functional protein domains. This generates a higher proportion of null mutations and substantially increases the potency of negative selection. We also show that the magnitude of negative selection can be used to infer the functional importance of individual protein domains of interest. A screen of 192 chromatin regulatory domains in murine acute myeloid leukemia cells identifies six known drug targets and 19 additional dependencies. A broader application of this approach may allow comprehensive identification of protein domains that sustain cancer cells and are suitable for drug targeting."
https://openalex.org/W1706150252,"Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) selectively degrades a subset of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes. A potent physiological activator of CMA is nutrient deprivation, a condition in which intracellular triglyceride stores or lipid droplets (LDs) also undergo hydrolysis (lipolysis) to generate free fatty acids for energetic purposes. Here we report that the LD-associated proteins perilipin 2 (PLIN2) and perilipin 3 (PLIN3) are CMA substrates and their degradation through CMA precedes lipolysis. In vivo studies revealed that CMA degradation of PLIN2 and PLIN3 was enhanced during starvation, concurrent with elevated levels of cytosolic adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and macroautophagy proteins on LDs. CMA blockage both in cultured cells and mouse liver or expression of CMA-resistant PLINs leads to reduced association of ATGL and macrolipophagy-related proteins with LDs and the subsequent decrease in lipid oxidation and accumulation of LDs. We propose a role for CMA in LD biology and in the maintenance of lipid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1517221380,"Immune systems must recognize and destroy different pathogens that threaten the host. CRISPR-Cas immune systems protect prokaryotes from viral and plasmid infection utilizing small CRISPR RNAs that are complementary to the invader's genome and specify the targets of RNA-guided Cas nucleases. Type III CRISPR-Cas immunity requires target transcription, and whereas genetic studies demonstrated DNA targeting, in vitro data have shown crRNA-guided RNA cleavage. The molecular mechanism behind these disparate activities is not known. Here, we show that transcription across the targets of the Staphylococcus epidermidis type III-A CRISPR-Cas system results in the cleavage of the target DNA and its transcripts, mediated by independent active sites within the Cas10-Csm ribonucleoprotein effector complex. Immunity against plasmids and DNA viruses requires DNA, but not RNA, cleavage activity. Our studies reveal a highly versatile mechanism of CRISPR immunity that can defend microorganisms against diverse DNA and RNA invaders."

We recently reported that radial neural stem cells (rNSCs) in the hippocampus undergo activation-dependent conversion into astrocytes, a mechanism that over time contributes to a reduction in the rNSC population. Here, we injected low and high levels of kainic acid (KA) in the dentate gyrus to assess whether neuronal hyperexcitation, a hallmark of epileptic disorders, could accelerate this conversion. At low levels of KA, generating epileptiform activity without seizures, we indeed found increased rNSC activation and conversion into astrocytes. At high levels, generating sustained epileptic seizures, however, we find that rNSCs divide symmetrically and that both mother and daughter cells convert into reactive astrocytes. Our results demonstrate that a threshold response for neuronal hyperexcitation provokes a dramatic shift in rNSC function, which impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the long term.

Adult neurogenesis (Altman and Das, 1965Altman J. Das G.D. Autoradiographic and histological evidence of postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis in rats.J. Comp.

In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG), newly born neurons migrate to become integrated in the mature granule cell synaptic circuitry (van Praag et al., 2002van Praag H.

Their ability to modulate the existing network to influence pattern separation is believed to encode context that underlies formation of distinct memories (Sahay et al., 2011Sahay A. Wilson D.A.

Because of its important role in memory formation and learning, impairment of adult hippocampal neurogenesis leads to deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks (Clelland et al., 2009Clelland C.D.

In addition, mood disorders such as anxiety and depression are affected by hippocampal neuroendocrine regulation and become exacerbated when adult neurogenesis is inhibited (Snyder et al., 2011Snyder J.S. Soumier A. Brewer M. Pickel J. Cameron H.A. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis buffers stress responses and depressive behaviour.Nature. 2011; 476: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). New neurons arise from a population of glia-like radial neural stem cells (rNSCs), that, like astrocytes, express glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (Fukuda et al., 2003Fukuda S. Kato F. Tozuka Y.

Astrocytes give rise to new neurons in the adult mammalian hippocampus.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7153-7160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). rNSCs divide mostly asymmetrically, giving rise to rapidly proliferating amplifying neural progenitors (ANPs) that lack GFAP expression and differentiate into neurons (Kempermann et al., 2004Kempermann G. Jessberger S. Steiner B. Kronenberg G. Milestones of neuronal development in the adult hippocampus.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 447-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Overproduction of ANPs is kept in check by apoptosis and microglial phagocytosis (Sierra et al., 2010Sierra A. Encinas J.M. Deudero J.J. Chancey J.H. Enikolopov G. Overstreet-Wadiche L.S. Tsirka S.E.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 3707-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), are known to target the ANP population, whereas mechanisms that specifically control quiescence and activation of rNSCs have been more challenging to identify. Early work had suggested that strong enhancers of neuronal activity such as electroconvulsive shock (Segi-Nishida et al., 2008Segi-Nishida E. Warner-Schmidt J.L. Duman R.S. Electroconvulsive seizure and VEGF increase the proliferation of neural stem-like cells in rat hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 11352-11357Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and systemic injection of kainic acid (KA), a glutamate agonist, increase activation of rNSCs (Hüttmann et al., 2003Hüttmann K. Sadgrove M. Wallraff A. Hinterkeuser S. Kirchhoff F. Steinhäuser C. Gray W.P.

Neurosci. 2003; 18: 2769-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). More recently, epileptic seizures were found to activate and expand a subset of quiescent rNSCs that were distinct from those activated by running (Lugert et al., 2010Lugert S. Basak O. Knuckles P. Haussler U. Fabel K. Götz M. Haas C.A. Kempermann G. Taylor V. Giachino C.

Using optogenetic approaches, Song et al., 2012Song J. Zhong C. Bonaguidi M.A. Sun G.J. Hsu D. Gu Y. Meletis K. Huang Z.J. Ge S. Enikolopov G. et al.Neuronal circuitry mechanism regulating adult quiescent neural stem-cell fate decision.Nature. 2012; 489: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar found that rNSCs depend on tonic release of GABA from fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons to make dynamic choices between activation and self-renewal modes, as well as return to quiescence. The transcription factor Ascl1 has been proposed to be a main molecular link between neuronal activity and rNSC activation (Andersen et al., 2014Andersen J. Urbán N. Achimastou A. Ito A. Simic M. Ullom K. Martynoga B. Lebel M. Göritz C. Frisén J. et al.A transcriptional mechanism integrating inputs from extracellular signals to activate hippocampal stem cells.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These recent findings suggest that activation of quiescent rNSCs is controlled directly by the level of activity of the surrounding hippocampal neural network, with important implications for pathological conditions of neuronal hyperactivation such as epilepsy. Indeed, it is known that epileptic seizures can chronically impair hippocampal neurogenesis (Hattiangady et al., 2004Hattiangady B. Rao M.S. Shetty A.K.

In turn, impaired neurogenesis has been suggested to contribute to the cognitive deficits (Gargaro et al., 2013Gargaro A.C. Sakamoto A.C. Bianchin M.M. Geraldi Cde.V. Scorsi-Rosset S. Coimbra E.R.

Taubøll E. Nagelhus E.A. Cvancarova M. Petter Ottersen O. Gjerstad L. Phenotypic characteristics of temporal lobe epilepsy: the impact of hippocampal sclerosis.Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 2009; : 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) associated with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE), a chronic condition in which a third of patients do not respond to medical treatment. Neuronal alterations, as well as reactive astrocytosis, have been proposed as an underlying mechanism driving both pathology and endogenous repair in epileptogenesis (Gibbons et al., 2013Gibbons M.B. Smeal R.M. Takahashi D.K. Vargas J.R. Wilcox K.S. Contributions of astrocytes to epileptogenesis following status epilepticus: opportunities for preventive therapy?.Neurochem. Int. 2013; 63: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the extent to which rNSCs as well may participate in these processes is not known. We reported earlier that under normal conditions and at the population level rNSCs have restricted mitotic potential; once they are activated to enter the cell cycle they undergo a round of several consecutive asymmetric cell divisions to generate neuronal precursors and immediately thereafter differentiate into astrocytes (Encinas et al., 2011bEncinas J.M. Michurina T.V. Peunova N. Park J.H. Tordo J. Peterson D.A. Fishell G. Koulakov A. Enikolopov G. Division-coupled astrocytic differentiation and age-related depletion of neural stem cells in the adult hippocampus.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 566-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Thus, rNSCs deplete over time after being activated, a mechanism accounting for most of the age-associated decline of hippocampal neurogenesis. Indeed, blocking rNSC activation through Acl1 knockout prevents the age-associated decline of the rNSC pool (Andersen et al., 2014Andersen J. Urbán N. Achimastou A. Ito A. Simic M. Ullom K. Martynoga B. Lebel M. Göritz C. Frisén J. et al.A transcriptional mechanism integrating inputs from extracellular signals to activate hippocampal stem cells.Neuron. 2014; 83: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we asked whether neuronal hyperexcitation in the hippocampus would intensify rNSC activation and accelerate their normal aging-related depletion, prematurely exhausting hippocampal neurogenesis. We also asked whether distinct levels of neuronal hyperexcitation would elicit disparate responses on rNSCs and the neurogenic niche. Using constitutive and conditional nestin-based reporter transgenic mice, we performed intrahippocampal injections of high and low doses of KA to model MTLE (Bouilleret et al., 1999Bouilleret V. Ridoux V. Depaulis A. Marescaux C. Nehlig A. Le Gal La Salle G. Recurrent seizures and hippocampal sclerosis following intrahippocampal kainate injection in adult mice: electroencephalography, histopathology and synaptic reorganization similar to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.Neuroscience. 1999; 89: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), as well as epileptiform activity (EA), neuronal hyperexcitation discharges in the form of waves and spikes that do not trigger seizures, but are detectable by electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in epilepsy patients. We find in both models that rNSC activation is increased and rNSC depletion accelerated, but both elicit distinctly different self-renewal modes. In order to test distinct levels of neuronal hyperactivity in a precisely controlled manner, we resorted to KA, which can be delivered locally into the DG accurately titrated (Figure 1) to consistently reproduce the human pathophysiological features of MTLE: unprovoked seizures and hippocampal sclerosis, including cell death, gliosis, inflammation, and granule cell dispersion (GCD) (Babb et al., 1995Babb T.L.

Granule cell dispersion develops without neurogenesis and does not fully depend on astroglial cell generation in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.Epilepsia. 2008; 49: 1711-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We confirmed the seizure-inducing effect of 1 nmol of KA in 50 nl of saline (MTLE mice) injected into the DG of Nestin-GFP transgenic mice (Mignone et al., 2004Mignone J.L. Kukekov V. Chiang A.S. Steindler D. Enikolopov G. Neural stem and progenitor cells in nestin-GFP transgenic mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 469: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), in which rNSCs and ANPs are readily visualized in the SGZ (Figure 1A). EEG recordings from the hippocampus confirmed that MTLE mice developed seizures (repetitive-spike and slow-wave discharges lasting 10 s or more) within 6 hr after the KA injection and later generated seizures spontaneously for the duration of the recording, which lasted up to 50 days (Figures 1B–1D). In addition to seizures, MTLE mice also had interictal discharges, determined as fast and high amplitude spike events lasting up to 200 ms (Figures 1B–1E). The electrographic seizures in MTLE mice were synchronized with behavioral stage 4–5 generalized seizures (monitored by video recording) according to the Racine scale (Racine, 1972Racine R.J. Modification of seizure activity by electrical stimulation. II. Motor seizure.Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 1972; 32: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5739) Google Scholar), with forelimb clonus, rearing, and falling (data not shown). In addition to the MTLE, we developed a model to mimic the EA that occurs between seizures. For this purpose, we injected a lower dose of KA (0.037 nmol in 50 nl of saline) into the DG of Nestin-GFP mice (EA mice). EA mice did not develop seizures at any time point, but as early as 6 hr after the KA injection they showed epileptiform discharges that continued intermittently for the duration of the recordings (Figure 1B). The frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges was significantly higher in the MTLE group as compared with the EA group (Figure 1E). Saline-injected controls (Sal mice) did not display seizures or EA at any time during the monitoring. In addition to seizures and interictal spikes, MTLE is also characterized by a number of pathological changes in the DG. Accordingly, we found significantly increased GCD and decreased GC density in MTLE mice (Figures 1F–1I) compared with Sal and EA mice, while no difference was found between the latter two groups. We also measured inflammation at 1- and 3-day post-KA injection (dpKAi) by determining the expression of mRNA from several cytokines (Figure 1J). At 1 dpKAi, MTLE mice significantly overexpressed interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) compared with Sal mice. IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β mRNA levels were also significantly higher in the MTLE group in comparison to the EA group. At this time point, IL-6 and TNF-α were significantly higher in EA mice compared with Sal mice. At 3 dpKAi, however, all the analyzed cytokines were significantly overexpressed in MTLE mice when compared with Sal and EA mice, but no difference was found between the latter two groups (Figure 1J). To further explore our EA model, we performed genome-wide expression analysis of the DG from Sal, EA, and MTLE mice at 3 dpKAi by means of a two-color gene microarray (Figure S1). We found that the expression changes induced by EA were subtle and not significant compared with the Sal group when using conventional statistical criteria (for a sample size = 4), and thus, more permissive statistical criteria were used (Figure S1A). To investigate the functional relevance of the changes induced by EA and MTLE, we performed pathway and gene ontology enrichment analyses. We found that MTLE induced a robust overexpression of pathways involved in matrix remodeling; cellular damage (unfolded protein response, stress, and apoptosis); activation of the cellular and humoral branches of the immune system; activation of the cell cycle; metabolism; and signaling pathways such as Notch, semaphorin 4b, and the erbB tyrosine kinase receptor (Figure S1B; Table S1). MTLE also induced a robust downregulation of pathways related to neurotransmitter receptor and signaling (mostly related to ionotropic glutamate receptors); glycosphingolipid and nitric oxide metabolism; as well as signaling pathways related to nodal/activin, hedgehog, and other components of the erbB pathway (Figure S1C; Table S2). Most of the changes induced by EA were also induced by MTLE (genes with common regulation), including upregulation of pathways related to the cell cycle or the immune response (Figure S1C; Table S3), and downregulation of a few genes, for which functional analysis could not be performed (Table S4). In addition, EA specifically induced changes in the expression of few genes that were not modified by MTLE and were not functionally related (Tables S5 and S6). These results show that our EA model triggers a subtle response in the DG and therefore is a unique tool to study changes in rNSCs directly related to neuronal hyperactivity, whereas, as expected, MTLE provokes a strong pathological response. Our hypothesis predicts that different levels of neuronal hyperactivity will lead to different amounts of rNSC and ANP activation. To test this prediction, we first determined the number of cells which were in cell cycle, measured as Ki67-positive cells in the SGZ and the GCL together. Proliferation was significantly increased in EA mice (both at 3 and 7 dpKAi) and MTLE mice (at 3 dpKAi), but was later (at 50 and 150 dpKAi) decreased below the Sal group levels (Figures S2A–S2C). We then used the thymidine analog 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a tool that allows the analysis of cell proliferation as well as of survival and differentiation. In agreement with previous reports, a very low proportion of rNSCs were in S phase (3.29% ± 0.44%) in the Sal group after a short pulse (BrdU was given at 2 dpKAi and the mice were sacrificed 2 hr later). In contrast, there were significant increases in the EA (7.62% ± 0.18%) and MTLE (14.87 ± 1.32) groups (Figure S2D). The same changes in cell proliferation in EA and MTLE mice compared with the Sal group were observed when measured with Ki67 (Figure S2E). To determine which cell types were proliferating in the DG, we administered BrdU to Nestin-GFP mice at 2 or 6 dpKAi and sacrificed the animals 24 hr later. The number of activated (BrdU-positive) rNSCs was notably higher in MTLE mice at 3 and 7 dpKAi (Figures 2A–2D). Interestingly, MTLE did not induce ANP proliferation at 3 or 7 dpKAi. In fact, the number of proliferating ANPs was reduced in MTLE mice compared to both Sal and EA mice (Figures 2A and 2B). In contrast, EA increased not only the activation of rNSCs at 3 and 7 dpKAi (although more modestly than MTLE), but also the proliferative activity of ANPs at both time points (Figures 2A and 2B). Importantly, dividing astrocytes (BrdU+GFAP+ Nestin-GFP− cells) were rarely observed, and their number was not altered in EA or MTLE mice (Figures 2A–2D). BrdU+ cells were almost completely restricted to the SGZ in Sal and EA mice, but in MTLE mice, dividing cells were also found in the hilus and the molecular layer (these cells were excluded from the quantification, Figure 2E). In conclusion, MTLE induced a rapid and massive activation of rNSCs to enter the cell cycle whereas EA induced a more modest but still significant activation of rNSCs and also promoted ANP proliferation. Remarkably, in MTLE, rNSCs not only became activated in large numbers, but they also changed both their morphology and their cell-cycle program. At 3 dpKAi, we observed that the majority of the rNSCs presented a “reactive phenotype” (Figures 2 and 3), following similar criteria used to describe reactive astrocytes (Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010Sofroniew M.V. Vinters H.V. Astrocytes: biology and pathology.Acta Neuropathol. 2010; 119: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar): In contrast to the typical single radial process that characterizes rNSCs in normal conditions (Figure 3A), several primary processes emerged from an enlarged soma of the rNSCs of MTLE mice. In addition, the processes were also significantly thicker, and there was a clear increased expression of both Nestin-GFP and GFAP. Finally, secondary branching, especially in the initial segment of the primary process, was noticeable in the rNSCs of MTLE mice (Figures 3A–3C). The quantification of these morphological parameters (number and thickness of the primary processes, and secondary branching) showed significant differences (Figures 3D–3F). No differences in rNSC morphology were identified in EA and Sal mice. Thus, after seizures, rNSCs acquire a reactive phenotype that shares features with that of reactive astrocytes: increased ramification, hypertrophic cell body, thickened prolongations, and overexpression of nestin and GFAP. We also observed that in MTLE mice most of the daughter cells of reactive rNSCs presented a similar phenotype to that of the mother cell, suggesting that seizures prompt a switch from predominantly asymmetric rNSC division in normal conditions to symmetric division (Figures 3G–3L). We modified slightly our experimental paradigm for BrdU administration to investigate this functional switch in the type of cell division of rNSCs in detail. Nestin-GFP mice were intrahippocampally injected with Sal or KA and at 2 dpKAi were administered BrdU (four injections 2 hr apart). The animals were sacrificed 16 hr after the first BrdU injection (Figure 3G), a period shorter than the estimated time needed to complete mitosis (Hayes and Nowakowski, 2002Hayes N.L. Nowakowski R.S.

Thus, we analyzed only BrdU-stained pairs of cells in which the nuclei of the rNSC and its daughter cell were in contact and their cytoplasms were still united. Under normal conditions and as we confirmed in the Sal and EA mice, rNSCs divide mostly asymmetrically, giving rise to ANPs that bear only very short (1–5 μm) and thin (1–2 μm) processes and lack GFAP expression (Figures 3I and 3J). In contrast, in MTLE mice, we observed that daughter cells being born from reactive rNSCs had long (10–50 μm) and thick (3–5 μm) processes strongly immunostained for GFAP (Figures 3K and 3L). Thus, in contrast to the asymmetric neurogenic model of division that takes place in normal conditions and in Sal and EA mice, we here demonstrate a symmetrical model of division of rNSCs in which both the mother and daughter cell dif"

The origin of these myeloid cells, and the response of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) to MI, however, is unclear. Here, we identify a CCR2(+)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK hematopoietic subset as the most upstream contributor to emergency myelopoiesis after ischemic organ injury. This subset has 4-fold higher proliferation rates than CCR2(-)CD150(+)CD48(-) LSK cells, displays a myeloid differentiation bias, and dominates the migratory HSPC population. We further demonstrate that the myeloid translocation gene 16 (Mtg16) regulates CCR2(+) HSPC emergence. Mtg16(-/-) mice have decreased levels of systemic monocytes and infarct-associated macrophages and display compromised tissue healing and post-MI heart failure. Together, these data provide insights into regulation of emergency hematopoiesis after ischemic injury and identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate leukocyte output after MI."

https://openalex.org/W2129138941,"Vaccines for rapidly evolving pathogens will confer lasting immunity if they elicit antibodies recognizing conserved epitopes, such as a receptor-binding site (RBS). From characteristics of an influenza-virus RBS-directed antibody, we devised a signature motif to search for similar antibodies. We identified, from three vaccinees, over 100 candidates encoded by 11 different VH genes. Crystal structures show that antibodies in this class engage the hemagglutinin RBS and mimic binding of the receptor, sialic acid, by supplying a critical dipeptide on their projecting, heavy-chain third complementarity determining region. They share contacts with conserved, receptor-binding residues but contact different residues on the RBS periphery, limiting the likelihood of viral escape when several such antibodies are present. These data show that related modes of RBS recognition can arise from different germline origins and mature through diverse affinity maturation pathways. Immunogens focused on an RBS-directed response will thus have a broad range of B cell targets."
https://openalex.org/W1837192145,"Genomic alterations in GNAS, the gene coding for the Gαs heterotrimeric G protein, are associated with a large number of human diseases. Here, we explored the role of Gαs on stem cell fate decisions by using the mouse epidermis as a model system. Conditional epidermal deletion of Gnas or repression of PKA signalling caused a remarkable expansion of the stem cell compartment, resulting in rapid basal-cell carcinoma formation. In contrast, inducible expression of active Gαs in the epidermis caused hair follicle stem cell exhaustion and hair loss. Mechanistically, we found that Gαs–PKA disruption promotes the cell autonomous Sonic Hedgehog pathway stimulation and Hippo signalling inhibition, resulting in the non-canonical activation of GLI and YAP1. Our study highlights an important tumour suppressive function of Gαs–PKA, limiting the proliferation of epithelial stem cells and maintaining proper hair follicle homeostasis. These findings could have broad implications in multiple pathophysiological conditions, including cancer. Gutkind and colleagues delineate a tumour suppressive signalling pathway involving the Gαs G protein and the PKA kinase, which inhibits pro-tumorigenic Yap and Shh signalling in epidermal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547537150,"Under uncertainty, the brain uses previous knowledge to transform sensory inputs into the percepts on which decisions are based. When the uncertainty lies in the timing of sensory evidence, however, the mechanism underlying the use of previously acquired temporal information remains unknown. We study this issue in monkeys performing a detection task with variable stimulation times. We use the neural correlates of false alarms to infer the subject's response criterion and find that it modulates over the course of a trial. Analysis of premotor cortex activity shows that this modulation is represented by the dynamics of population responses. A trained recurrent network model reproduces the experimental findings and demonstrates a neural mechanism to benefit from temporal expectations in perceptual detection. Previous knowledge about the probability of stimulation over time can be intrinsically encoded in the neural population dynamics, allowing a flexible control of the response criterion over time."
https://openalex.org/W1911557887,"In addition to inter-chromatid cohesion, mitotic and meiotic chromatids must have three physical properties: compaction into ‘threads’ roughly co-linear with their DNA sequence, intra-chromatid cohesion determining their rigidity, and a mechanism to promote sister chromatid disentanglement. A fundamental issue in chromosome biology is whether a single molecular process accounts for all three features. There is universal agreement that a pair of Smc–kleisin complexes called condensin I and II facilitate sister chromatid disentanglement, but whether they also confer thread formation or longitudinal rigidity is either controversial or has never been directly addressed respectively. We show here that condensin II (beta-kleisin) has an essential role in all three processes during meiosis I in mouse oocytes and that its function overlaps with that of condensin I (gamma-kleisin), which is otherwise redundant. Pre-assembled meiotic bivalents unravel when condensin is inactivated by TEV cleavage, proving that it actually holds chromatin fibres together. By inactivating condensin I or II before the first meiotic division in mouse oocytes, Nasmyth and colleagues demonstrate that condensin is needed for chromatin thread formation and chromosome rigidity."

While brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential to high-frequency stimulation-induced LTP in many brain areas, the role of BDNF in t-LTP is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate a striking change in the expression mechanism of t-LTP in CA1 of the hippocampus following two distinct modes of synaptic activation. Single postsynaptic APs paired with presynaptic stimulation activated a BDNF-independent canonical t-LTP. In contrast, a theta burst of postsynaptic APs preceded by presynaptic stimulation elicited BDNF-dependent postsynaptic t-LTP that relied on postsynaptic BDNF secretion. This suggests that BDNF release during burst-like patterns of activity typically observed in vivo may play a crucial role during memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W1533064539,"The mammalian eye-to-brain pathway includes more than 20 parallel circuits, each consisting of precise long-range connections between specific sets of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and target structures in the brain. The mechanisms that drive assembly of these parallel connections and the functional implications of their specificity remain unresolved. Here we show that in the absence of contactin 4 (CNTN4) or one of its binding partners, amyloid precursor protein (APP), a subset of direction-selective RGCs fail to target the nucleus of the optic tract (NOT)--the accessory optic system (AOS) target controlling horizontal image stabilization. Conversely, ectopic expression of CNTN4 biases RGCs to arborize in the NOT, and that process also requires APP. Our data reveal critical and novel roles for CNTN4/APP in promoting target-specific axon arborization, and they highlight the importance of this process for functional development of a behaviorally relevant parallel visual pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2170080777,"Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule- interacting proteins. Nine enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family catalyze glutamylation. TTLL7, the most abundant neuronal glutamylase, adds glutamates preferentially to the β-tubulin tail. Coupled with ensemble and single-molecule biochemistry, our hybrid X-ray and cryo-electron microscopy structure of TTLL7 bound to the microtubule delineates a tripartite microtubule recognition strategy. The enzyme uses its core to engage the disordered anionic tails of α- and β-tubulin, and a flexible cationic domain to bind the microtubule and position itself for β-tail modification. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all single-chain TTLLs with known glutamylase activity utilize a cationic microtubule-binding domain analogous to that of TTLL7. Therefore, our work reveals the combined use of folded and intrinsically disordered substrate recognition elements as the molecular basis for specificity among the enzymes primarily responsible for chemically diversifying cellular microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W1493583608,"How the highly stereotyped morphologies of individual neurons are genetically specified is not well understood. We identify six transcription factors (TFs) expressed in a combinatorial manner in seven post-mitotic adult leg motor neurons (MNs) that are derived from a single neuroblast in Drosophila. Unlike TFs expressed in mitotically active neuroblasts, these TFs do not regulate each other's expression. Removing the activity of a single TF resulted in specific morphological defects, including muscle targeting and dendritic arborization, and in a highly specific walking defect in adult flies. In contrast, when the expression of multiple TFs was modified, nearly complete transformations in MN morphologies were generated. These results show that the morphological characteristics of a single neuron are dictated by a combinatorial code of morphology TFs (mTFs). mTFs function at a previously unidentified regulatory tier downstream of factors acting in the NB but independently of factors that act in terminally differentiated neurons."

Select subtypes of retinal ganglion cells perceive image motion and connect to the accessory optic system (AOS) in the brain, which generates compensatory eye movements that stabilize images during slow visual field motion. Here, we show that the murine transmembrane semaphorin 6A (Sema6A) is expressed in a subset of On direction-selective ganglion cells (On DSGCs) and is required for retinorecipient axonal targeting to the medial terminal nucleus (MTN) of the AOS. Plexin A2 and A4, two Sema6A binding partners, are expressed in MTN cells, attract Sema6A(+) On DSGC axons, and mediate MTN targeting of Sema6A(+) RGC projections. Furthermore, Sema6A/Plexin-A2/A4 signaling is required for the functional output of the AOS. These data reveal molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of AOS circuits critical for moving image perception."
https://openalex.org/W1960615704,"The coordinated regulation of mitochondrial and nuclear activities is essential for cellular respiration and its disruption leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, a hallmark of ageing. Mitochondria communicate with nuclei through retrograde signalling pathways that modulate nuclear gene expression to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis. The monooxygenase CLK-1 (human homologue COQ7) was previously reported to be mitochondrial, with a role in respiration and longevity. We have uncovered a distinct nuclear form of CLK-1 that independently regulates lifespan. Nuclear CLK-1 mediates a retrograde signalling pathway that is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and is responsive to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, thus acting as a barometer of oxidative metabolism. We show that, through modulation of gene expression, the pathway regulates both mitochondrial reactive oxygen species metabolism and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. Our results demonstrate that a respiratory enzyme acts in the nucleus to control mitochondrial stress responses and longevity. Whitmarsh and colleagues identify a nuclear form of the mitochondrial enzyme, CLK-1 in C. elegans and COQ7 in human cells, respectively, that senses reactive oxygen species and regulates gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W211995612,"Humans living at high altitude (≥ 2,500 meters above sea level) have acquired unique abilities to survive the associated extreme environmental conditions, including hypoxia, cold temperature, limited food availability and high levels of free radicals and oxidants. Long-term inhabitants of the most elevated regions of the world have undergone extensive physiological and/or genetic changes, particularly in the regulation of respiration and circulation, when compared to lowland populations. Genome scans have identified candidate genes involved in altitude adaption in the Tibetan Plateau and the Ethiopian highlands, in contrast to populations from the Andes, which have not been as intensively investigated. In the present study, we focused on three indigenous populations from Bolivia: two groups of Andean natives, Aymara and Quechua, and the low-altitude control group of Guarani from the Gran Chaco lowlands. Using pooled samples, we identified a number of SNPs exhibiting large allele frequency differences over 900,000 genotyped SNPs. A region in chromosome 10 (within the cytogenetic bands q22.3 and q23.1) was significantly differentiated between highland and lowland groups. We resequenced ~1.5 Mb surrounding the candidate region and identified strong signals of positive selection in the highland populations. A composite of multiple signals like test localized the signal to FAM213A and a related enhancer; the product of this gene acts as an antioxidant to lower oxidative stress and may help to maintain bone mass. The results suggest that positive selection on the enhancer might increase the expression of this antioxidant, and thereby prevent oxidative damage. In addition, the most significant signal in a relative extended haplotype homozygosity analysis was localized to the SFTPD gene, which encodes a surfactant pulmonary-associated protein involved in normal respiration and innate host defense. Our study thus identifies two novel candidate genes and associated pathways that may be involved in high-altitude adaptation in Andean populations."
https://openalex.org/W218737921,"Adiponectin, an adipokine predominantly produced from adipose tissue, exhibited potent anti-inflammatory properties. In particular, it inhibits production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in macrophages. Autophagy, an intracellular self-digestion process, has been recently shown to regulate inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated the role of autophagy induction in the suppression of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced TNF-α expression by globular adiponectin (gAcrp) and its potential mechanisms. Herein, we found that gAcrp treatment increased expression of genes related with autophagy, including Atg5 and microtubule-associated protein light chain (LC3B), induced autophagosome formation and autophagy flux in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Similar results were observed in primary macrophages isolated peritoneum of mice. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by pretreatment with Bafilomycin A1 or knocking down of LC3B gene restored suppression of TNF-α expression, tumor necrosis factor receptor- associated factor 6 (TRAF6) expression and p38MAPK phosphorylation by gAcrp, implying a critical role of autophagy induction in the development of tolerance to LPS-induced TNF-α expression by gAcrp. We also found that knocking-down of FoxO3A, a forkhead box O member of transcription factor, blocked gAcrp-induced expression of LC3II and Atg5. Moreover, gene silencing of Silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) blocked both gAcrp-induced nuclear translocation of FoxO3A and LC3II expression. Finally, pretreatment with ROS inhibitors, prevented gAcrp-induced SIRT1 expression and further generated inhibitory effects on gAcrp-induced autophagy, indicating a role of ROS production in gAcrp-induced SIRT1 expression and subsequent autophagy induction. Taken together, these findings indicate that globular adiponectin suppresses LPS-induced TNF-α expression, at least in part, via autophagy activation. Furthermore, SIRT1-FoxO3A axis plays a crucial role in gAcrp-induced autophagy in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W854922782,"In the past few decades, several researchers have proposed highly accurate prediction models that have typically relied on climate parameters. However, climate factors can be unreliable and can lower the effectiveness of prediction when they are applied in locations where climate factors do not differ significantly. The purpose of this study was to improve a dengue surveillance system in areas with similar climate by exploiting the infection rate in the Aedes aegypti mosquito and using the support vector machine (SVM) technique for forecasting the dengue morbidity rate.Areas with high incidence of dengue outbreaks in central Thailand were studied. The proposed framework consisted of the following three major parts: 1) data integration, 2) model construction, and 3) model evaluation. We discovered that the Ae. aegypti female and larvae mosquito infection rates were significantly positively associated with the morbidity rate. Thus, the increasing infection rate of female mosquitoes and larvae led to a higher number of dengue cases, and the prediction performance increased when those predictors were integrated into a predictive model. In this research, we applied the SVM with the radial basis function (RBF) kernel to forecast the high morbidity rate and take precautions to prevent the development of pervasive dengue epidemics. The experimental results showed that the introduced parameters significantly increased the prediction accuracy to 88.37% when used on the test set data, and these parameters led to the highest performance compared to state-of-the-art forecasting models.The infection rates of the Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes and larvae improved the morbidity rate forecasting efficiency better than the climate parameters used in classical frameworks. We demonstrated that the SVM-R-based model has high generalization performance and obtained the highest prediction performance compared to classical models as measured by the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and mean absolute error (MAE)."

It is also capable of flowering and producing seeds, but requires vernalization in some cases. DORMANCY ASSOCIATED MADS-BOX (DAM) genes have been proposed to play a direct role in the transition to winter-induced dormancy and maintenance through regulation of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which also is likely involved in the vernalization process. To explore the regulation of FT and DAM during dormancy transitions in leafy spurge, the transcript accumulation of two previously cloned DAM splice variants and two different previously cloned FT genes was characterized. Under long-photoperiods (16 h light), both DAM and FT transcripts accumulate in a diurnal manner. Tissue specific expression patterns indicated the tissues with high DAM expression had low FT expression and vice versa. DAM expression is detected in leaves, stems, shoot tips, and crown buds. FT transcripts were detected mainly in leaves and flowers. Under dormancy inducing conditions, DAM and FT genes had an inverse expression pattern. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed using DAM-like protein specific antibodies to demonstrate that DAM or related proteins likely bind to cryptic and/or conserved CArG boxes in the promoter regions of FT genes isolated from endodormant crown buds. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that DAM proteins play a crucial role in leafy spurge dormancy transition and maintenance, potentially by negatively regulating the expression of FT."

We present a large-scale investigation of the inter-chromosomal segment and gene contact networks in embryonic stem cells of two mammalian organisms: humans and mice. Both interaction networks are characterized by a high degree of clustering of genome regions and the existence of hubs. Both genomes exhibit similar structural characteristics such as increased flexibility of certain Y chromosome regions and co-localization of centromere-proximal regions. Spatial proximity is correlated with the functional similarity of genes in both species. We also found a significant association between spatial proximity and the co-expression of genes in the human genome. The structural properties of chromatin are also species specific, including the presence of two highly interactive regions in mouse chromatin and an increased contact density on short, gene-rich human chromosomes, thereby indicating their central nuclear position. Trans-interacting segments are enriched in active marks in human and had no distinct feature profile in mouse. Thus, in contrast to interactions within individual chromosomes, the inter-chromosomal interactions in human and mouse embryonic stem cells do not appear to be conserved."

Biomedical literature mining can aid DDI research by extracting evidence for large numbers of potential interactions from published literature and clinical databases. Though DDI is investigated in domains ranging in scale from intracellular biochemistry to human populations, literature mining has not been used to extract specific types of experimental evidence, which are reported differently for distinct experimental goals. We focus on pharmacokinetic evidence for DDI, essential for identifying causal mechanisms of putative interactions and as input for further pharmacological and pharmacoepidemiology investigations. We used manually curated corpora of PubMed abstracts and annotated sentences to evaluate the efficacy of literature mining on two tasks: first, identifying PubMed abstracts containing pharmacokinetic evidence of DDIs; second, extracting sentences containing such evidence from abstracts. We implemented a text mining pipeline and evaluated it using several linear classifiers and a variety of feature transforms. The most important textual features in the abstract and sentence classification tasks were analyzed. We also investigated the performance benefits of using features derived from PubMed metadata fields, various publicly available named entity recognizers, and pharmacokinetic dictionaries. Several classifiers performed very well in distinguishing relevant and irrelevant abstracts (reaching F1≈0.93, MCC≈0.74, iAUC≈0.99) and sentences (F1≈0.76, MCC≈0.65, iAUC≈0.83). We found that word bigram features were important for achieving optimal classifier performance and that features derived from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms significantly improved abstract classification. We also found that some drug-related named entity recognition tools and dictionaries led to slight but significant improvements, especially in classification of evidence sentences. Based on our thorough analysis of classifiers and feature transforms and the high classification performance achieved, we demonstrate that literature mining can aid DDI discovery by supporting automatic extraction of specific types of experimental evidence."

T cell and antibody responses were measured.The vaccines were generally well-tolerated, and did not cause serious adverse events. The response rate, by IFN-γ ELISPOT, was greater when Ad35-GRIN was the priming vaccine and in the co-administration groups. F4/AS01 induced CD4+ T-cells expressing primarily CD40L and IL2 +/- TNF-α, while Ad35-GRIN induced predominantly CD8+ T-cells expressing IFN-γ +/- IL2 or TNF-α. Viral inhibition was induced after Ad35-GRIN vaccination, regardless of the regimen. Strong F4-specific antibody responses were induced.

https://openalex.org/W1496663128,"Adenocarcinoma (AdC) is the most common lung cancer subtype and is often associated with pleural effusion (PE). Its poor prognosis is attributable to diagnostic delay and lack of effective treatments and there is a pressing need in discovering new biomarkers for early diagnosis or targeted therapies. To date, little is known about lung AdC proteome. We investigated protein expression of lung AdC in PE using the isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) approach to identify possible novel diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. This provided the identification of 109 of lung AdC-related proteins. We further analyzed lumican, one of the overexpressed proteins, in 88 resected lung AdCs and in 23 malignant PE cell-blocks (13 lung AdCs and 10 non-lung cancers) using immunohistochemistry. In AdC surgical samples, lumican expression was low in cancer cells, whereas it was strong and diffuse in the stroma surrounding the tumor. However, lumican expression was not associated with tumor grade, stage, and vascular/pleural invasion. None of the lung cancer cell-blocks showed lumican immunoreaction, whereas those of all the other tumors were strongly positive. Finally, immunoblotting analysis showed lumican expression in both cell lysate and conditioned medium of a fibroblast culture but not in those of A549 lung cancer cell line. PE is a valid source of information for proteomic analysis without many of the restrictions of plasma. The high lumican levels characterizing AdC PEs are probably due to its release by the fibroblasts surrounding the tumor. Despite the role of lumican in lung AdC is still elusive, it could be of diagnostic value."
https://openalex.org/W2171724686,"Bird and arthropod predation is often associated with natural pest control in agricultural landscapes, but the rates of predation may vary with the amount of tree cover or other environmental factors. We examined bird and arthropod predation in three tree-rich and three tree-poor landscapes across southwestern Ethiopia. Within each landscape we selected three tree-rich and three tree-poor homegardens in which we recorded the number of tree species and tree stems within 100 × 100 m surrounding the central house. To estimate predation rates, we attached plasticine caterpillars on leaves of two coffee and two avocado shrubs in each homegarden, and recorded the number of attacked caterpillars for 7–9 consecutive weeks. The overall mean daily predation rate was 1.45% for birds and 1.60% for arthropods. The rates of arthropod predation varied among landscapes and were higher in tree-poor landscapes. There was no such difference for birds. Within landscapes, predation rates from birds and arthropods did not vary between tree-rich and tree-poor homegardens in either tree-rich or tree-poor landscapes. The most surprising result was the lack of response by birds to tree cover at either spatial scale. Our results suggest that in tree-poor landscapes there are still enough non-crop habitats to support predatory arthropods and birds to deliver strong top-down effect on crop pests."

Intra-abdominal anti-adhesion gel reduces the incidence of adhesions, but effects on fertility after uterine surgery are not known. The objective of our work was to evaluate the effect of intrauterine anti-adhesion gel on spontaneous fertility after repeated intrauterine surgery with induced experimental synechiae in the rabbit model.Twenty New Zealand White rabbits underwent a double uterine curettage 10 days apart and were randomized into two groups. Each rabbit served as its own control: one uterine tube was the treatment group (A), the second uterine tube was the control group (B) to avoid bias through other causes of infertility. Group A received a post curettage intrauterine instillation of anti-adhesion gel whereas group B, the control group, underwent curettage without instillation of the gel. After a recovery period, the rabbits were mated. An abdominal ultrasound performed 21 days after mating allowed us to diagnose pregnancy and quantify the number of viable fetuses.There was a significant difference in total fetuses in favor of group A, with an average of 3.7 (range, 0-9) total fetuses per tube against 2.1 (0-7) in group B (p = .04). The number of viable fetuses shows a trend in favor of group A, with an average of 3.4 (0-7) viable fetuses per tube against 1.9 (0-6) viable fetuses per tube in group B (p = .05).The use of immediate postoperative anti-adhesion gel improved fertility in an animal model after intrauterine surgery likely to cause uterine synechiae. This experimental model will permit comparison of different anti-adhesion solutions, including assessment of their tolerance and potential mucosal toxicity on embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1491720268,"Conflicts between humans and crocodilians are a widespread conservation challenge and the number of crocodile attacks is increasing worldwide. We identified the factors that most effectively decide whether a victim is injured or killed in a crocodile attack by fitting generalized linear models to a 42-year dataset of 87 attacks (27 fatal and 60 non-fatal) by saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) in Australia. The models showed that the most influential factors were the difference in body mass between crocodile and victim, and the position of victim in relation to the water at the time of an attack. In-water position (for diving, swimming, and wading) had a higher risk than on-water (boating) or on-land (fishing, and hunting near the water's edge) positions. In the in-water position a 75 kg person would have a relatively high probability of survival (0.81) if attacked by a 300 cm crocodile, but the probability becomes much lower (0.17) with a 400 cm crocodile. If attacked by a crocodile larger than 450 cm, the survival probability would be extremely low (<0.05) regardless of the victim's size. These results indicate that the main cause of death during a crocodile attack is drowning and larger crocodiles can drag a victim more easily into deeper water. A higher risk associated with a larger crocodile in relation to victim's size is highlighted by children's vulnerability to fatal attacks. Since the first recently recorded fatal attack involving a child in 2006, six out of nine fatal attacks (66.7%) involved children, and the average body size of crocodiles responsible for these fatal attacks was considerably smaller (384 cm, 223 kg) than that of crocodiles that killed adults (450 cm, 324 kg) during the same period (2006-2014). These results suggest that culling programs targeting larger crocodiles may not be an effective management option to improve safety for children."

Cellular and molecular events responsible for liver stage development are poorly characterized. Here, we show that sporozoite, liver stage tryptophan-rich protein (SLTRiP) forms large multimers. Mice immunized with a purified recombinant SLTRiP protein gave high antibody titers in both inbred and outbred mice. Immunized mice showed highly significant levels of protection upon challenge with sporozoites and exhibited 10,000-fold fewer parasite 18S-rRNA copy numbers in their livers. The protection offered by immunization with SLTRiP came mainly from T-cells, and antibodies had little role to play despite their high titers. Immunofluorescence assays showed that SLTRiP is expressed in the sporozoite and early to late liver stages of malaria parasites. SLTRiP protein is exported to the cytosol of infected host cells during the early hours of parasite infection. Parasites deficient in SLTRiP were moderately defective in liver stage parasite development. A transcriptome profile of SLTRiP-deficient parasite-infected hepatocytes highlighted that SLTRiP interferes with multiple pathways in the host cell.

https://openalex.org/W219279757,"Autosomal dominant non-syndromic hearing loss is highly heterogeneous, and eyes absent 4 (EYA4) is a disease-causing gene. Most EYA4 mutations founded in the Eya-homologous region, however, no deafness causative missense mutation in variable region of EYA4 have previously been found. In this study, we identified a pathogenic missense mutation located in the variable region of the EYA4 gene for the first time in a four-generation Chinese family with 57 members. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on samples from one unaffected and two affected individuals to systematically search for deafness susceptibility genes, and the candidate mutations and the co-segregation of the phenotype were verified by polymerase chain reaction amplification and by Sanger sequencing in all of the family members. Then, we identified a novel EYA4 mutation in exon 8, c.511G>C; p.G171R, which segregated with postlingual and progressive autosomal dominant sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). This report is the first to describe a missense mutation in the variable region domain of the EYA4 gene, which is not highly conserved in many species, indicating that the potential unconserved role of 171G>R in human EYA4 function is extremely important."
https://openalex.org/W2335828972,"Combined chemo-gene therapy is one of the treatment modalities that have attracted extensive research interests; however, there is little information regarding the influence of drug application on gene transfer. This study bridges this gap by examining how chemotherapeutic drugs (teniposide, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and temozolomide) interfere with polyplex formation and transfection of chitosan-graft-poly(ethylenimine). Our results indicate that the degree of drug interference varies with the mechanism of drug action, with the transgene expression being severely suppressed when the plasmid is co-delivered with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) or teniposide but not temozolomide. In addition, the interference with transfection by drugs varies with different gene/drug co-formulations. This is the first study to evidence that, though combined chemo-gene therapy has therapeutic potential, some chemotherapeutic drugs may reduce the treatment efficiency of gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2293257892,"This work presents a numerical simulation of intraventricular flow after the implantation of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve at the mitral position. The left ventricle was simplified conceptually as a truncated prolate spheroid and its motion was prescribed based on that of a healthy subject. The rigid leaflet rotation was driven by the transmitral flow and hence the leaflet dynamics were solved using fluid-structure interaction approach. The simulation results showed that the bileaflet mechanical heart valve at the mitral position behaved similarly to that at the aortic position. Sudden area expansion near the aortic root initiated a clockwise anterior vortex, and the continuous injection of flow through the orifice resulted in further growth of the anterior vortex during diastole, which dominated the intraventricular flow. This flow feature is beneficial to preserving the flow momentum and redirecting the blood flow towards the aortic valve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to numerically model intraventricular flow with the mechanical heart valve incorporated at the mitral position using a fluid-structure interaction approach. This study facilitates future patient-specific studies."
https://openalex.org/W314475785,"Objective The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to predict adverse outcomes in several pathologic conditions. The majority of indeterminate interferon (IFN)-γ release assays were due to inadequate IFN-γ response to the phytohemagglutinin. We sought to study the value of NLR to predict an indeterminate result of QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) performed in routine laboratory practice. Methods Results from 2,773 QFT-GIT assays were analyzed. Data collection included demographic data, the level of IFN-γ to nil, mitogen, and TB antigen of QFT-GIT, total WBC, and a differential count. We calculated the absolute neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and NLR. Results Of the total, 224 (8.1%) indeterminate results were observed. Twelve (1.8%) showed indeterminate results in the NLR range from 1.71 to 2.84, but 132 (19.2%) had indeterminate results in NLR≥5.18 (p<0.0001). The likelihood ratio for indeterminate results were 2.70 (95% CI, 2.36-3.08) in NLR ≥5.18 and 1.93 (95% CI, 1.64-2.27) in lymphocyte count ≤1050/μL. NLR and neutrophil count were independent predictors for indeterminate QFT-GIT result in multiple regression analysis. The IFN-γ response to PHA was negatively associated with NLR (r=-0.33, p<0.001). Conclusion We showed that the NLR is an independent predictor of indeterminate QFT-GIT result. Low frequency of indeterminate results in group with normal NLR may imply the importance of a balance between two cellular compartments in physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W332478907,"Multimodal monitoring of brain state is important both for the investigation of healthy cerebral physiology and to inform clinical decision making in conditions of injury and disease. Near-infrared spectroscopy is an instrument modality that allows non-invasive measurement of several physiological variables of clinical interest, notably haemoglobin oxygenation and the redox state of the metabolic enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Interpreting such measurements requires the integration of multiple signals from different sources to try to understand the physiological states giving rise to them. We have previously published several computational models to assist with such interpretation. Like many models in the realm of Systems Biology, these are complex and dependent on many parameters that can be difficult or impossible to measure precisely. Taking one such model, BrainSignals, as a starting point, we have developed several variant models in which specific regions of complexity are substituted with much simpler linear approximations. We demonstrate that model behaviour can be maintained whilst achieving a significant reduction in complexity, provided that the linearity assumptions hold. The simplified models have been tested for applicability with simulated data and experimental data from healthy adults undergoing a hypercapnia challenge, but relevance to different physiological and pathophysiological conditions will require specific testing. In conditions where the simplified models are applicable, their greater efficiency has potential to allow their use at the bedside to help interpret clinical data in near real-time."

The metabolic pathway can be represented by a mathematical model known as the generalized mass action model, which leads to a complex nonlinear equations system. The optimization process becomes difficult when steady state and the constraints of the components in the metabolic pathway are involved. To deal with this situation, this paper presents an in silico optimization method, namely the Newton Cooperative Genetic Algorithm (NCGA). The NCGA used Newton method in dealing with the metabolic pathway, and then integrated genetic algorithm and cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm. The proposed method was experimentally applied on the benchmark metabolic pathways, and the results showed that the NCGA achieved better results compared to the existing methods."

The messages that a user writes in these networks and his/her interactions with other users leave a digital trace that is recorded. Thanks to this fact and the use of network theory, the analysis of messages, user interactions, and the complex structures that emerge is greatly facilitated. In addition, information generated in on-line social networks is labeled temporarily, which makes it possible to go a step further analyzing the dynamics of the interaction patterns. In this article, we present an analysis of the evolution of user interactions that take place in television, socio-political, conference, and keynote events on Twitter. Interactions have been modeled as networks that are annotated with the time markers. We study changes in the structural properties at both the network level and the node level. As a result of this analysis, we have detected patterns of network evolution and common structural features as well as differences among the events."
https://openalex.org/W1605489610,"Near work is associated with increased activity in the neck and shoulder muscles, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. This study was designed to determine whether a dynamic change in focus, alternating between a nearby and a more distant visual target, produces a direct parallel change in trapezius muscle activity. Fourteen healthy controls and 12 patients with a history of visual and neck/shoulder symptoms performed a Near-Far visual task under three different viewing conditions; one neutral condition with no trial lenses, one condition with negative trial lenses to create increased accommodation, and one condition with positive trial lenses to create decreased accommodation. Eye lens accommodation and trapezius muscle activity were continuously recorded. The trapezius muscle activity was significantly higher during Near than during Far focusing periods for both groups within the neutral viewing condition, and there was a significant co-variation in time between accommodation and trapezius muscle activity within the neutral and positive viewing conditions for the control group. In conclusion, these results reveal a connection between Near focusing and increased muscle activity during dynamic changes in focus between a nearby and a far target. A direct link, from the accommodation/vergence system to the trapezius muscles cannot be ruled out, but the connection may also be explained by an increased need for eye-neck (head) stabilization when focusing on a nearby target as compared to a more distant target."
https://openalex.org/W2134860331,"Glucagon levels are often moderately elevated in diabetes. It is known that glucagon leads to a decrease in hepatic glutathione (GSH) synthesis that in turn is associated with decreased postprandial insulin sensitivity. Given that cAMP pathway controls GSH levels we tested whether insulin sensitivity decreases after intraportal (ipv) administration of a cAMP analog (DBcAMP), and investigated whether glucagon promotes insulin resistance through decreasing hepatic GSH levels.Insulin sensitivity was determined in fed male Sprague-Dawley rats using a modified euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp in the postprandial state upon ipv administration of DBcAMP as well as glucagon infusion. Glucagon effects on insulin sensitivity was assessed in the presence or absence of postprandial insulin sensitivity inhibition by administration of L-NMMA. Hepatic GSH and NO content and plasma levels of NO were measured after acute ipv glucagon infusion. Insulin sensitivity was assessed in the fed state and after ipv glucagon infusion in the presence of GSH-E. We founf that DBcAMP and glucagon produce a decrease of insulin sensitivity, in a dose-dependent manner. Glucagon-induced decrease of postprandial insulin sensitivity correlated with decreased hepatic GSH content and was restored by administration of GSH-E. Furthermore, inhibition of postprandial decrease of insulin sensitivity L-NMMA was not overcome by glucagon, but glucagon did not affect hepatic and plasma levels of NO. These results show that glucagon decreases postprandial insulin sensitivity through reducing hepatic GSH levels, an effect that is mimicked by increasing cAMP hepatic levels and requires physiological NO levels. These observations support the hypothesis that glucagon acts via adenylate cyclase to decrease hepatic GSH levels and induce insulin resistance. We suggest that the glucagon-cAMP-GSH axis is a potential therapeutic target to address insulin resistance in pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W803963015,"Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri colonizes its hosts through the trafficking of effector proteins to the plant cell by the type III protein secretion system. In X. citri subsp. citri, as in other plant pathogens, the hrp cluster encodes the type III protein secretion system and is regulated by the transcription factors HrpG and HrpX. HrpG belongs to the OmpR family's response regulator of EnvZ/OmpR two-component signal transduction system. Here, we show that the arginine 210 residue is crucial for the transcriptional activity of HrpG revealed by the absence of disease in host plants and hypersensitive response in non-host plants when a strain carrying this point mutation is used in plant infiltration assays. Also, this strain showed decreased expression levels of hrp genes in bacteria grown in culture or when they were recovered from citrus leaves. Moreover, we show for the first time that HrpG binds to both hrpX and its own promoter, and the change of the arginine 210 by a cysteine does not prevent the binding to both promoters. Nevertheless, in vitro hrpX transcription was observed only with HrpG whereas no transcription was detected with the R210C mutant. HrpG was able to interact with itself as well as with the mutant R210C suggesting that it functions as a dimer. The mutant protein R210C showed altered protease sensitivity, suggesting that Arg210 is essential for protein active conformation and thus for transcriptional activity. Our results indicate that arginine 210 in HrpG, as it may occur with this conserved residue in other members of this family of response regulators, is not required for DNA binding whereas is essential for hrp genes transcription and therefore for pathogenicity and HR induction."
https://openalex.org/W240232324,"Suberin-derived substituted fatty acids have been shown to be potential biomarkers for plant-derived carbon (C) in soils across ecosystems. Analyzing root derived suberin compounds bound in soil could help to understand the root input into a soil organic carbon pool. In this study, bound lipids were extracted and identified in root and topsoil samples. Short-chain suberin diacids were quantified under rice (Oryza sativa L.) and rape (Brassica campestris) rotations with different cultivar combinations in a Chinese rice paddy. After removal of free lipids with sequential extraction, the residual bound lipids were obtained with saponification and derivatization before analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Diacids C16 and C18 in bound lipids were detected both in rice and rape root samples, while diacids C20 and C22 were detected only in rape root samples. Accordingly, diacids were quantified in both rhizosphere and bulk soil (0-15 cm). The amount of total root-derived diacids in bulk soil varied in a range of 5.6-9.6 mg/kg across growth stages and crop seasons. After one year-round rice-rape rotation, root-derived suberin diacids were maintained at a level of 7-9 mg/kg in bulk soil; this was higher under a super rice cultivar LY than under a hybrid cultivar IIY. While concentrations of the analyzed diacids were generally higher in rhizosphere than in bulk soil, the total diacid (DA) concentration was higher at the time of rape harvest than at rice harvest, suggesting that rape roots made a major contribution to the preservation of diacids in the paddy. Moreover, the net change in the concentration and the ratios of C16:0 DA to C18:1 DA, and of C16:0 DA to C18:0 DA, over a whole growing season, were greater under LY than under IIY, though there was no difference between cultivars within a single growth stage. Overall, total concentration of root-derived suberin diacids was found to be positively correlated to soil organic carbon concentration both for bulk soil and rhizosphere. However, the turnover and preservation of the root suberin biomolecules with soil property and field conditions deserve further field studies."
https://openalex.org/W297482906,"Polymerization of the Z variant alpha-1-antitrypsin (Z-α1AT) results in the most common and severe form of α1AT deficiency (α1ATD), a debilitating genetic disorder whose clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic to fatal liver and/or lung disease. As the altered conformation of Z-α1AT and its attendant aggregation are responsible for pathogenesis, the polymerization process per se has become a major target for the development of therapeutics. Based on the ability of Z-α1AT to aggregate by recruiting the reactive center loop (RCL) of another Z-α1AT into its s4A cavity, we developed a high-throughput screening assay that uses a modified 6-mer peptide mimicking the RCL to screen for inhibitors of Z-α1AT polymer growth. A subset of compounds from the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) with molecular weights ranging from 300 to 700 Da, was used to evaluate the assay’s capabilities. The inhibitor S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioguanosine was identified as a lead compound and its ability to prevent Z-α1AT polymerization confirmed by secondary assays. To further investigate the binding location of S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioguanosine, an in silico strategy was pursued and the intermediate α1AT M* state modeled to allow molecular docking simulations and explore various potential binding sites. Docking results predict that S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioguanosine can bind at the s4A cavity and at the edge of β-sheet A. The former binding site would directly block RCL insertion whereas the latter site would prevent β-sheet A from expanding between s3A/s5A, and thus indirectly impede RCL insertion. Altogether, our investigations have revealed a novel compound that inhibits the formation of Z-α1AT polymers, as well as in vitro and in silico strategies for identifying and characterizing additional blocking molecules of Z-α1AT polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W304026471,"The neutral theory of biodiversity has emerged as a major null hypothesis in community ecology. The neutral theory may sufficiently well explain the structuring of microbial communities as the extremely high microbial diversity has led to an expectation of high ecological equivalence among species. To address this possibility, we worked with microcosms of two soils; the microcosms were either exposed, or not, to a dilution disturbance which reduces community sizes and removes some very rare species. After incubation for recovery, changes in bacterial species composition in microcosms compared with the source soils were assessed by pyrosequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. Our assays could detect species with a proportional abundance ≥ 0.0001 in each community, and changes in the abundances of these species should have occurred during the recovery growth, but not be caused by the disturbance per se. The undisturbed microcosms showed slight changes in bacterial species diversity and composition, with a small number of initially low-abundance species going extinct. In microcosms recovering from the disturbance, however, species diversity decreased dramatically (by > 50%); and in most cases there was not a positive relationship between species initial abundance and their chance of persistence. Furthermore, a positive relationship between species richness and community biomass was observed in microcosms of one soil, but not in those of the other soil. The results are not consistent with a neutral hypothesis that predicts a positive abundance-persistence relationship and a null effect of diversity on ecosystem functioning. Adaptation mechanisms, in particular those associated with species interactions including facilitation and predation, may provide better explanations."

Serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations were measured before and 72 h after contrast administration. Glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) were estimated using serum creatinine-based [Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Cockroft-Gault and cystatin C based (Larsson) equations. Exploratory data analysis was performed. The nonparametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare pre and post contrast of test results and estimated clearance. The confidence interval used in the analysis was 95%.Compared with the pre-contrast values, the mean serum creatinine concentration was significantly higher and average GFRs estimated using MDRD and Cockcroft-Gault equations were significantly lower after the administration of contrast (p <0.001). It was also observed a significant increase after contrast in the concentration of Cystatin C (p = 0.015). In addition, a decrease in GFR estimated using the average Larsson (p = 0.021) was observed between time points. However, none of the patients presented clinically significant nephropathy.Assessment using serum creatinine and cystatin C concentrations showed changes in renal function among patients with cancer undergoing contrast-enhanced CT examination in this study. No significant renal damage related to the use of low-osmolarity iodinated contrast medium of the type and dosage employed in this study was observed. This contrast medium is thus safe for use in patients with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W280396912,"We identified the spatiotemporal patterns of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the years 1982-2008 in the desert areas of Northwest China and quantified the impacts of climate and non-climate factors on NDVI changes. The results indicate that although the mean NDVI has improved in 24.7% of the study region; 16.3% among the region has been stagnating in recent years and only 8.4% had a significantly increasing trend. Additionally, 45.3% of the region has maintained a stable trend over the study period and 30.0% has declined. A multiple regression model suggests that a wetter climate (quantified by the Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI) is associated with higher NDVI in most areas (18.1% of significance) but these historical changes in PDSI only caused an average improvement of approximately 0.4% over the study region. Contrasting the regression results under different trend patterns, no significant differences in PDSI impacts were detected among the four trend patterns. Therefore, we conclude that climate is not the primary driver for vegetative coverage in Northwest China. Future studies will be required to identify the impacts of specific non-climatic factors on vegetative coverage based on high-resolution data, which will be beneficial in creating an effective strategy to combat the recent desertification trend in China."
https://openalex.org/W2953237605,"Models of social influence have explored the dynamics of social contagion, imitation, and diffusion of different types of traits, opinions, and conducts. However, few behavioral data indicating social influence dynamics have been obtained from direct observation in ""natural"" social contexts. The present research provides that kind of evidence in the case of the public expression of political preferences in the city of Barcelona, where thousands of citizens supporting the secession of Catalonia from Spain have placed a Catalan flag in their balconies and windows. Here we present two different studies. 1) During July 2013 we registered the number of flags in 26% of the electoral districts in the city of Barcelona. We find that there is a large dispersion in the density of flags in districts with similar density of pro-independence voters. However, by comparing the moving average to the global mean we find that the density of flags tends to be fostered in electoral districts where there is a clear majority of pro-independence vote, while it is inhibited in the opposite cases. We also show that the distribution of flags in the observed districts deviates significantly from that of an equivalent random distribution. 2) During 17 days around Catalonia's 2013 national holiday we observed the position at balcony resolution of the flags displayed in the facades of a sub-sample of 82 blocks. We compare the 'clustering index' of flags on the facades observed each day to thousands of equivalent random distributions. Again we provide evidence that successive hangings of flags are not independent events but that a local influence mechanism is favoring their clustering. We also find that except for the national holiday day the density of flags tends to be fostered in facades located in electoral districts where there is a clear majority of pro-independence vote."
https://openalex.org/W1806189676,"Establishing mixed chimerism is a promising approach for inducing donor-specific transplant tolerance. The establishment and maintenance of mixed chimerism may enable long-term engraftment of organ transplants while minimizing the use of immunosuppressants. Several protocols for inducing mixed chimerism have been reported; however, the exact mechanism underlying the development of immune tolerance remains to be elucidated. Therefore, understanding the kinetics of engraftment during early post-transplant period may provide insight into establishing long-term mixed chimerism and permanent transplant tolerance. In this study, we intentionally induced allogeneic mixed chimerism using a nonmyeloablative regimen by host natural killer (NK) cell depletion and T cell-depleted bone marrow (BM) grafts in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched murine model and analyzed the kinetics of donor (C57BL/6) and recipient (BALB/c) engraftment in the weeks following transplantation. Donor BM cells were well engrafted and stabilized without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) as early as one week post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Donor-derived thymic T cells were reconstituted four weeks after BMT; however, the emergence of newly developed T cells was more obvious at the periphery as early as two weeks after BMT. Also, the emergence and changes in ratio of recipient- and donor-derived NKT cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells were noted after BMT. Here, we report a longitudinal analysis of the development of donor- and recipient-originated hematopoietic cells in various lymphatic tissues of intentionally induced mixed chimerism mouse model during early post-transplant period. Through the understanding of immune reconstitution at early time points after nonmyeloablative BMT, we suggest guidelines on intentionally inducing durable mixed chimerism."
