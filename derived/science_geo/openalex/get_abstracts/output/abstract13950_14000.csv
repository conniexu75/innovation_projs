https://openalex.org/W1994625228,"An enzymatic preparation from human brain converts tryptamine to tryptoline (9H-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrido(3,4-b)indole) in the presence of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. Similarly, N-methyltryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine yield 1-methyltryptoline and 5-hydroxytryptoline, respectively. Neither in vitro nor in vivo formation of these compounds by human tissues has been described."
https://openalex.org/W2039668585,"The significance of fever in response to a bacterial infection has been investigated using the lizard Dipsosaurus dorsalis as an animal model. These lizards develop a fever of about 2 degrees C after injection with the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila. To determine whether this elevation in body temperature increases the resistance of the host to this infection, as measured by survival, lizards were infected with the live bacteria and placed in a neutral (38 degrees C), low (34 degrees or 36 degrees C), or high (40 degrees or 42 degrees C) ambient temperature. An elevation in temperature following experimental bacterial infection results in a significant increase in host survival."

https://openalex.org/W1540596657,"The binding of Ca2+ to prothrombin and the intermediates of prothrombin activation was investigated by equilibrium dialysis using 45Ca2+ as the ligand. Scatchard plots of these data indicate that prothrombin (Mr = 70,000) has 10 to 11 Ca2+ binding sites which can be differentiated in terms of their binding affinity. Six of these Ca2+ binding sites have log Kassoc = 3.5 and all are found intact in the NH2-terminal segment (activation intermediate 3, Mr = 23,000) of the prothrombin molecule. Four or five additional weaker binding sites for Cz2+ with log Kassoc = 2.7 present in prothrombin are found intact in the remaining COOH-segment (activation intermediate 1, Mr = 51,000) of the prothrombin molecule. Upon further activation the Ca2+ binding sites residing in intermediate 1 are found intact in activation intermediate 4 (which constitutes the NH2-terminal segment of the intermediate 1 molecule). The remaining COOH-terminal portion (activation intermediate 2, Mr = 41,000) of the intermediate 1 molecule has no affinity for Ca2+. The activation of prothrombin and activation intermediates 1 and 2 was studied using these activators: Factor Xa alone, Factor Xa-Ca+, AND Factor Xa-Ca2+-phospholipid. The rate of thrombin production from prothrombin was progressively increased as Ca2+ and phospholipid were added to the system, whereas no significant increase in the rates of activation of intermediate 1 and 2 was observed. When Factor V was added to the Factor Xa-Ca2+-phospholipid system, the rate of activation of intermediate 1 was greatly enhanced. In the absence of Ca2+, Factor V had no effect on the rate of thrombin formation from intermediate 1. Factor V had no stimulatory effects on the rate of intermediate 2 activation. However, in the presence of an equimolar amount of intermediate 4, Factor V accelerated the conversion of intermediate 2 to thrombin. These studies indicate that the Ca2+ binding sites of the prothrombin molecule are contained in the pro fragment (intermediates 3 and 4) of the prothrombin molecule. Intermediate 1 and intermediate 2, both of which lack the strong Ca2+ binding sites of prothrombin, are poor substrates for the Factor Xa-Ca2+-phospholipid complex activation when compared to prothrombin. The addition of Factor V to the catalyst results in acceleration of the activation rate of intermediate 1 and an equimolar mixture if intermediates 2 and 4. These results lead us to conclude that the strong Ca2+ binding sites are the sites of phospholipid binding (intermediate 3), whereas the seak binding sites are the sites of Factor V binding (intermediate 4)."

https://openalex.org/W1549176069,"Multiple forms of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 isolated from immature male rats pretreated with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene are described. Afraction of low specific content (Fraction A. 1.7 TO 4.0 nmol of cytochrome P-450 per mg of protein) and a fraction substantially purified (Fraction B, 9.0 TO 11.0 NMOL of cytochrome P-450 per mg of protein) are obtained by DEAE-cellulose chromatography of a partially purified cytochrome P-450 preparation in the presence of Emulgen 911. Shifts in the absorption maxima in the CO-reduced and ethyl isocyanide difference spectra are observed in the fractions derived from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. The fractions derived from phenobarbital-treated rats exhibit different 455:430 ratios and pH intercepts in the ethyl isocyanide difference spectra. The absolute oxidized spectra and n-octylamine binding spectra at room temperature and EPR analysis at the temperature of liquid helium characterize all the fractions, except the Fraction A from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats, as low spin ferric hemeproteins. The A hemeprotein fractions from both 3-methylcholanthrene- and phenobarbital-treated rats have poor catalytic activity for the metabolism of benzphentamine and 3,4-benzo-[a]pyrene in comparison to the B hemeprotein fractions which may be due to the presence of a high concentration of Emulgen 911 in the A fractions. However, the presence of Emulgen 911 cannot account for the spectral differences among the fractions."

https://openalex.org/W2017791865,"Using a translational assay and new analytical procedures we have found that: •—Histone mRNA can be detected both associated with polyribosomes and in the postribosomal supernatant of S phase HeLa S3 cells. •—Inhibition of DNA replication by cytosine arabinoside treatment causes histone mRNA to completely disappear from polyribosomes, and little histone mRNA can be detected in the postribosomal supernatant of inhibited cells. These data indicate that histone mRNA does not accumulate in the cytoplasm after the inhibition of DNA replication. •—Histone mRNA species cannot be detected in the postribosomal supernatant of G1 cells synchronized by selective detachment. This observation, together with the previous finding that histone mRNA is not present on G1 polyribosomes, is consistent with the idea of a transcriptional block in histone mRNA production and transport to the cytoplasm during G1."
https://openalex.org/W1989861513,"The Balb/3T3 mouse embryo cell line has been frequently used in cancer research as representative of nontumorigenic cells with the characteristic in vitro properties of postconfluence inhibition of cell division, low saturation density, and anchorage dependence. On the reasoning that anchorage dependence might also apply in vivo, each of nine mice were subcutaneously inoculated with an average of 15,400 Balb/3T3 cells attached to two glass beads 3 millimeters in diameter. After 8 weeks, all the mice had developed large bloody tumors that microscopically proved to be hemangioendotheliomas. Ther inoculation of Balb/3T3 cells alone or beads alone produced no tumors. Transplants of each tumor into normal mice grew to kill the animal within 6 weeks. Tumor cells from collagenase-disaggregated tumor tissue had a plating efficiency of 21.2 percent compared to that of normal adult subcutaneous fibroblasts of less than 0.1 percent. The tumor cells in vitro closely resembled Balb/3T3 cells in appearance and were tumorigenic at a dose of 10-4 cells. A second, repeat experiment produced the same type of tumors grossly and microscopically in 17 of 25 mice between 99 and 211 days after inoculation of the Balb/3T3 cells attached to glass beads. These findings require a reassessment of the postulate that low saturation density, postconfluence of cell division, and anchorage dependence are characteristic in vitro properties only of nonneoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1579581978,"Sulfated glycoproteins having blood group H activity were isolated from the sputum of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis, by reduction of the fibrillar mucus, chromatography on ECTEOLA-cellulose, and gel filtration on Sepharose 4B. The sulfated glycoproteins were degraded with alkaline borohydride, and the degradation products were fractionated by chromatography on ion exchange resins and by gel filtration. The carbohydrate chains thus obtained have a wide heterogeneity with regard to acidity and molecular size. The neutral chains contain blood group H active oligosaccharides and incomplete chains as short as 1 residue of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose. The minimal size of the neuraminic acid-containing chains is less than that of the sulfated chains, which increases with the degree of sulfation. The sulfate groups are linked at C-6 at the D-galactose residues."

These responses are much less variable in amplitude than would be expected if rods were independent quantum detectors. Rods interact with one another by pooling their signals, so that at least 85 to 90 percent of the response recorded from a single rod is generated by pigment molecules bleached in other receptors."

The absence of one class of mechanoreceptors throughout postembryonic development deprives certain sensory neurons of normal stimulation and results in abnormal physiological and structural development of an identified interneuron."

https://openalex.org/W2090872342,"The cellular levels of the various RNA polymerases have been monitored in resting human peripheral lymphocytes and in lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin. Activity was measured in the presence of exogenous templates following solubilization and chromatographic resolution of the different RNA polymerases. Resting lymphocytes contain Class I, II, and III RNA polymerases, although the respective levels of activity are very low compared to the levels in metabolically active cell types. During the PHA-induced transformation of resting lymphocytes, the Class I, II, and III enzyme levels rise dramatically. During four days exposure to PHA, the levels of RNA polymerases I and III (which synthesize, respectively, rRNA and the transfer and 5S RNAs) increase 17 fold, while the level of RNA polymerase II (which synthesizes heterogeneous nuclear RNA) increases 8 fold. The possible relationship between enzyme levels and the regulation of gene expression is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529180858,"At least 60 percent of the fucose residues in HeLa cell glycoprotein are nonreducing, terminal, and closely proximal to the protein carbohydrate linkage. As determined by pulse-labeling with (3H) fucose and sizing glycopeptides in Sephadex chromatography these residues are added near the time of completion of oligosaccharide chains. Glycoproteins, the large bulk if not the only macromolecules labeled with radioactive fucose in HeLa cells, were not soluble in ethanol or chloroform-methanol, 2:1, but were substanially solubilized by chloroform-methanol-water, 10:10:3. Folch extraction of labeled cells and analysis of the upper phase revealed little if any (3H) fucose-labeled glycosphingolipids. Studies on the distribution of radioactively labeled glycoprotein in various cell fractions show that in uniform labeling conditions fucosylated glycoproteins accumulate in the plasma membrane specifically. Pulse-chase and protein synthesis inhibitor studies show that there is an internal pool of completed fucosylated glycoprotein, taking not less than 12 min to deplete. From this pool newly synthesized glycoprotein moves to the plasma membrane with a transit time of 12 min and little was found soluble in the cell. By contrast, a pool of protein labeled with 14C-aminoacids and precursor to plasma membrane protein is small and depleted almost immediately. From this pool newly synthesized protein molecules move to the plasma membrane with a transit time of less than 2 min. It would appear that these two distinct molecular components of plasma membranes may be assembled into membranes sequentially or into the plasma membrane independently."

The calcium source was examined by microprobe analysis of cytoplasmic pigmented granules. Illumination markedly depleted granules of calcium and altered them structurally. Release of calcium from granules is essential for phototransduction.
https://openalex.org/W2028348432,"Spots of light were used to measure the light sensitivity of spatially separated regions of single Limulus photoreceptors. The desensitization caused by irradiating part of the cell was largest in the irradiated region. The desensitization caused by intracellular calcium ion injection was largest near the infection site. The spread of desensitization away from the injection site suggests that calcium ion can diffuse over neuronal dimensions, but that the effective rate of diffusion is not so high as to abolish calcium gradients. The results are compatible with the previously proposed hypothesis that a rise in the intracellular calcium ion concentration mediates light adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1982332806,Trichlorofluoromethane (CCl3F) measurements in the troposphere over the Atlantic in 1971 and over the Pacific in 1972 and 1974 were compared. A rapid increase of CCl3F in the troposphere is evident. The observed increase of CCl3F between 1971 and 1974 is proportional to the increase of industrially produced amounts of CCl3F in the same time period.

On illumination the globules rearrange into paracrystalline arrays and membrane-like lamellae. The morphologic transformation may be related to calcium release from the granules, and the released calcium may mediate the light-evoked hyperpolarization described by others."
https://openalex.org/W1516596254,"Administration of a single injection of estradiol-17 beta to adult male Xenopus laevis induces the synthesis and secretion by the liver of the egg-yolk protein complex vitellogenin. Explants taken from livers of hormone-treated animals and maintained in organ culture continue to produce this protein at a rate which is dependent on the length of time between estrogen injection of the donor and preparation of the explants. Organ culture, therefore, can be used to quantitate the vitellogenic response and to study its time course in detail. An increase in the rate of incorporation of radioactive amino acids into secreted protein is first detectable in explants taken from animals 12 hours after estradiol injection. The response becomes increasingly pronounced as the period after hormone treatment of the donors is prolonged, and it is maximal in explants taken from frogs 12 days after estrogen administration. At this time production of vitellogenin can account for as much as 90 per cent of total protein synthesis in the liver. Labeling of intracellular protein with [14C]serine is stimulated 2-fold and incorporation into secreted protein increased 36-fold under conditions where the rate or extent of uptake of radioactive precursor into the acid-soluble pool does not change. After a lag period of 2 to 4 hours the secretion of vitellogenin in culture continues at a constant rate for up to 3 days. At least part of the stability of yolk protein synthesis in culture is attributable to long lived messenger RNA species. The major component of vitellogenin labeled wither in vivo or in culture has a molecular weight of approximately 180,000 as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Material labeled with [3H]serine gives a similar distribution of radioactivity on gel electrophoresis as that labeled with [35S]methionine, with no peak corresponding to the molecular weight of phosvitin. It is suggested that phosvitin is not a primary product of translation but is synthesized as part of the large subunit of vitellogenin."

https://openalex.org/W1556487680,"The effect of phenobarbital on the rates of the synthesis of the protein and heme moieties of cytochromeP-450 has been studied. For this purpose, cytochrome P-450 has been partially purified as its P-420 derivative and the labeled amino acid incorporation into the protein has been studied after subjecting a partially purified preparation to sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The incorporation studies into the protein species after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis reveal that the drug primarily accelerates the rate of apoptotein synthesis followed by an increase in the rate of heme synthesis. The messenger for apocytochrome P-450 appears to be fairly stable."

https://openalex.org/W1520677058,"The effects of in vitro treatment of the hepatic microsomal fraction with various porphyrin compounds on the activity and the content of the heme-containing components of the mixed function oxidase system were studied. The compounds examined were hematin, methemalbumin (with heme to protein molar ratio of 13:1 or 1:1), mesohemalbumin, bilirubin, biliverdin, mesoporphyrin IX, and protoprophyrin IX. The activity of the system was monitored by measuring its oxidative activity for the type I and type II substrates, ethylmorphine and aniline, respectively; as well as the microsomal contents of cytochrome P-450 and b5 and 14C-labeled heme, Mesoporphyrin IX was found to be most effective in inhibiting the oxidative activity of the mixed function oxidase system as well as in decreasing the microsomal contents of cytochromes P-450, b5, and heme. Biliverdin exerted no effect on these parameters. Hematin and the other compounds studied exerted variable inhibitory effects on the system. The degradative and inhibitory effects of protoporphvrin IX and mesoporphyrin IS could be blocked significantly by conducting the studies in the dark. The presence of biliverdin decreased the inhibitory effects of the porphyrins on the system; conversely the effects could be magnified in the presence of deuterium oxide. It is suggested that the mechanism by which porphyrins inhibit the mixed function oxidase system is through porphyrin-sensitized photo-oxidation of various constituents of the hepatic microsomal fraction and that the formation of singlet oxygen molecules is most likely involved in this process. Moreover the destructive effects of heme compounds on the microsomal components and activities of the drug-metabolizing mixed function oxidase system raise questions concerning the hypothesis that the components of this system, and specifically cytochrome P-450, are involved in the activity of the heme oxygenase system."

https://openalex.org/W2011328095,"The hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal complex (HNC) of the fetal guinea pig shows a dramatic increase in its content of vasopressin and neurophysin between the 40th and 55th days of gestation. The values for radioimmunoassayable hormone and binding protein are at day 40, 2 milliunits and less than 0.1 microgram; and at day 55, about 100 milliunits and 10 micrograms, respectively. Isotope incorporation experiments with organ cultures of the fetal HNC taken prior to the 35th day of gestation added additional confirmation of the inability of the hypothalamic neurosecretory cells to synthesize vasopressin or neurophysin at this time. However, by the 45th day, similar organ cultures show a vigorous incorporation of labeled amino acids into both hormone and binding protein. Furthermore, the HNC of the 45-day-old fetus apparently contains a factor that stimulates specifically the biosynthesis of vasopressin and neurophysin in HNC cultures from the adult guinea pig. This factor is not detectable in either cortex or liver of the 45-day-old fetus or in the fetal HNC taken prior to or after the period of exponential rise (40th to 55th days) of hormone and binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W1562711907,"Factors which influence the distribution of pyruvate dehydrogenase between its active, unphosphorylated form (PDHa) and its inactive, phosphorylated form (PDHb) have been examined in isolated rat liver mitochondria. A rapid freezing method was developed for the extraction of pyruvate dehydrogenase from incubated mitochondria which prevented interconversions between PHDa and PDHb which normally occur when mitochondria are collected by centrifugal methods. The intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ration was varied over a 100-fold range by the addition of dinitrophenol, oligomycin, or both substances to mitochondria oxidizing 2-oxoglutarate. PDHa activity was found to be inversely proportional to the intramitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio but was not closely correlated with the extramitochondrial adenine nucleotide levels. When mitochondria were incubated in State 4 with succinate and rotenone, the addition of pyruvate increased PDHa activity more than 10-fold without appreciably altering the mitochondrial ATP:ADP ratio. These observations are most readily explained by the known inhibitory effects of pyruvate and ADP on PDHa kinase. PDHa activity could be maintained at a high level by incubating mitochondria in a condition resembling State 3 by the addition of succinate, glucose, and hexokinase. The further addition of octanoate reduced PDHa activity by 60% without appreciably altering the ATP:ADP ratio. Rotenone had a sililar effect. When added in the presence of octanoate, rotenone further decreased PDHa activity whereas 4-pentenoate led to an increase in activity. The effects of octanoate on PDHa activity were not seen when mitochondria were incubated in the presence of high levels of pyruvate, though pyruvate oxidation was till diminished by over 50%. The data suggest that octanoate addition favors the PDHa kinase reaction leading to inactivation of PDHa, and in addition causes the accumulation of NADH and acetyl-CoA which are recognized competitive inhibitors of pyruvate dehydrogenase."

https://openalex.org/W1594480325,"The level of pyruvate carboxylase in Pseudmonas citronellolis is controlled by the carbon source of the growth medium. The activity of the enzyme is highest in cells grown on lactate or glucose and virtually absent in cells grown on malate or aspartate. Double labeling studies with 3H- and 14C-labeled leucine confirm that pyruvate carboxylase is synthesized in the presence of lactate but not in the presence of aspartate. The studies also show that coordinated regulation occurs at the level of the synthesis of the two polypeptides which make up pyruvate carboxylase in P. citronellolis, rather than at the stages of their assembly into protomers or the biotinylation of the apoenzyme. There is no evidence for control of the catalytic acitivity of the holoenzyme via effectors. In all other varieties of pyruvate carboxylase examined thus far, the enzyme appears to be constitutive with regulation accomplished either through effector modulation of holoenzyme activity (pyruvate carbox-lase from animal sources, yeast, several species of bacteria) or through control of the biotinylation of the apoenzyme by holocarboxylase synthetase (Bacillus stearothermophilus, yeast)."

https://openalex.org/W1621234352,"In vitro incubation of hyperimmune rabbit lymphoid cells with the hallucinogenic indole alkaloid, d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), results in biosynthesis of modified, secretable immunoglobulin peptides. Modification involves covalent attachment of the lysergyl moiety to COOH-terminal portions of the peptides. Aalogous effects occur when cells are incubated in vitro in the presence of the non-hallucinogenic LSD analogue, d-lysergic acid, and N-[3H]-carboxymethyl-d-lysergamide. The phenomenon is reversed by tryptophan and is inhibited by puromycin and cycloheximide. In vitro attachment of the lysergyl moiety occurs in the presence of actinomycin D at levels which inhibit RNA synthesis. While LSD is not attached to intracellular tRNA, the drug binds to 80 S ribosomes from hyperimmune lymphoid cells with high affinity (K A equals 3.5 times 10-8 M-1). Similar binding occurs to nonimmune splenic ribosomes. Implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the degree of involvement of cellular protein translational mechanisms in the covalent attachment of the lysergyl moiety to low molecular weight immunoglobulin peptides."
