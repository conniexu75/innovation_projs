https://openalex.org/W2056046302,The amyloid β protein has been identified as an important component of both cerebrovascular amyloid and amyloid plaques of Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. A complementary DNA for the β protein suggests that it derives from a larger protein expressed in a variety of tissues. Overexpression of the gene in brain tissue from fetuses with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) can be explained by dosage since the locus encoding the β protein maps to chromosome 21. Regional localization of this gene by both physical and genetic mapping places it in the vicinity of the genetic defect causing the inherited form of Alzheimer's disease.

An antibody to a 19-mer from domain III inhibited attachment of HT-1080 and CHO cells to laminin, while the peptide itself was inactive. A nearby peptide (CDPGYIGSR) from domain III with homology to epidermal growth factor was synthesized and found to be one of the principle sites in laminin mediating cell attachment, migration, and receptor binding."
https://openalex.org/W2139127386,"The lipocortins are a group of proteins that have been reported to inhibit phospholipase A2 by direct interaction with enzyme. Two proteins which have been identified as lipocortin on the basis of inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity have recently been cloned and sequenced. These have been shown to be identical to the calpactins, which are membrane cytoskeletal proteins serving as major substrates of the tyrosine protein kinases. We have now found that two forms of calpactin (I and II) inhibit porcine pancreatic phospholipase A2 in an assay using Escherichia coli cells or extracted phospholipid vesicles as substrate, but only when the substrate concentration is very low. Both calpactins, as well as another, 73-kDa inhibitory protein, were found to bind purified phospholipids and E. coli cell membranes directly. Kinetic studies show that the inhibition of phospholipase A2 by calpactin can be overcome by high phospholipid substrate concentrations, whether E. coli cells or isolated phospholipid vesicles are used. For example, in the presence of 5 X 10(-10) M phospholipase A2 and 1 X 10(-7) M calpactin, the inhibition decreases from 100 to 0% as phospholipid in vesicles is raised from 2 to 8 microM. The evidence reported here strongly suggests that in vitro inhibition of phospholipase A2 by lipocortin is due to sequestering of the phospholipid substrate by the inhibitor protein, rather than a direct interaction with the phospholipase. These results raise questions about the physiological significance of the inhibition of phospholipases by calpactins."

https://openalex.org/W2072174355,"Although homelessness has been recognized as a serious and growing urban social problem, scientifically acceptable methods for estimating the composition and size of the homeless population have been lacking. A new research approach to estimating the size and composition of undomiciled urban populations is presented, and its utility is illustrated through a description of the literal homeless of Chicago. The homeless in the Chicago sample are unaffiliated persons living in extreme poverty, with high levels of physical and mental disability. Homelessness is interpreted as a manifestation of extreme poverty among persons without families in housing markets with declining stocks of inexpensive dwelling units suitable for single persons."
https://openalex.org/W1607959146,"A rat hepatocyte cell line was cultured in Higuchi's medium with fetal calf serum and insulin and labeled with 35SO2/4-. The cells were treated with a number of ligands to displace the heparan 35SO4 proteoglycan (HSPG) from the pericellular matrix. Maximum release was obtained with D-mannose-6-PO4 (50 mM), D-glucose-6-PO4 (50 mM), myo-inositol-2-PO4 (2-5 mM), myo-inositol hexaphosphate (2-5 mM), and DL-myo-inositol-1-PO4 (1-2 mM). D-myo-Inositol-1,3,4-(PO4)3 (1 mM) and L-myo-inositol-1-PO4 (2 mM) were intermediate in their ability to release the cell surface HSPG, whereas heparin (2 mg/ml), yeast phosphomannan (4 mg/ml), D-xylose-1-PO4 (50 mM), D-glucose-6-SO4 (50 mM), and myo-inositol hexasulfate (5 mM) were ineffective. When 35SO2/4- was added to cell cultures, the total cell surface HSPG increased linearly, but the percentage of the total cell surface [35SO4]HSPG that was released by myo-inositol-PO4 increased with time during the labeling period, reaching a maximum of 65% after 5 h. When cells were labeled for 12 h without insulin in the medium, the maximum amount of cell surface HSPG that was released by myo-inositol-PO4 was reduced to 30%. However, when cells labeled in the absence of insulin were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and then myo-inositol-PO4, the release of the cell surface [35SO4]HSPG was increased to 73%. When the [35SO4]HSPG that was released from the cell surface by treatment with myo-inositol-PO4 was added to cultures of unlabeled hepatocytes, it was taken up very rapidly and a portion of the internalized HSPG was converted to free heparan SO4 chains which appeared in the nucleus. Uptake was Ca2+- and Mg2+-independent. The amount of [35SO4]HSPG taken up was markedly reduced when the myo-inositol-PO4-releasable [35SO4]HSPG was pretreated with trypsin, thermolysin, alkaline borohydride, or alkaline phosphatase. When the cells were grown in inositol-deficient medium or in the presence of myo-inositol-PO4, the amount of heparan SO4 found in the nucleus was markedly reduced, and the cells no longer exhibited contact inhibition. These effects of myo-inositol deficiency on the growth and nuclear heparan SO4 were accentuated by addition of LiCl to the cultures to prevent phosphatidylinositol synthesis from the endogenous myo-inositol-PO4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1598176996,"The interactions of vascular smooth muscle caldesmon with actin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin were determined under conditions in which the four proteins can form reconstituted Ca2+-sensitive smooth muscle thin filaments. Caldesmon bound to actin in a complex fashion with high affinity sites (K = 10(7) M-1) saturating at a stoichiometry of 1 per 28 actins, and lower affinity sites at 1 per 7 actins. The affinity of binding was increased in the presence of tropomyosin, and this could be attributed to a direct interaction between caldesmon and tropomyosin which was demonstrated using caldesmon cross-linked to Sepharose. In the presence of tropomyosin, occupancy of the high affinity sites was associated with inhibition of actin-activated myosin MgATPase activity. Caldesmon was found to bind to calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+, with an affinity of 10(6) M-1. The binding of Ca2+ X calmodulin to caldesmon was associated with the neutralization of inhibition of actin-tropomyosin. Ca2+ X calmodulin binding reduced but did not abolish the binding of caldesmon to actin-tropomyosin. From this data we have proposed a model for smooth muscle thin filaments in which Ca2+ regulates activity by converting the inhibited actin-tropomyosin-caldesmon complex to the active complexes, actin-tropomyosin-caldesmon-calmodulin X Ca2+ and actin-tropomyosin."
https://openalex.org/W1590852456,"The interaction of three protein synthesis initiation factors, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4A, -4B, and -4F, with mRNA has been examined. Three assays specifically designed to evaluate this interaction are RNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, retention of mRNAs on nitrocellulose filters, and cross-linking to periodate-oxidized mRNAs. The ATPase activity of eIF-4A is only activated by RNA which is lacking in secondary structure, and the minimal size of an oligonucleotide capable of effecting an optimal activation is 12-18 bases. In the presence of ATP, eIF-4A is capable of binding mRNA. Consistent with the ATPase activity, this binding shows a definite preference for single-stranded RNA. In the absence of ATP, eIF-4F is the only factor to bind capped mRNAs, and this binding, unlike that of eIF-4A, is sensitive to m7GDP inhibition. The activities of both eIF-4A and eIF-4F are stimulated by eIF-4B, which seems to have no specific independent activity in our assays. Evidence from the cross-linking studies indicates that in the absence of ATP, only the 24,000-dalton polypeptide of eIF-4F binds to the 5' cap region of the mRNA. From the data presented in conjunction with the current literature, a suggested sequence of factor binding to mRNA is: eIF-4F is the first initiation factor to bind mRNA ind an ATP-independent fashion; eIF-4B then binds to eIF-4F, if in fact it was not already bound prior to mRNA binding; and finally, eIF-4A binds to the eIF-4F X eIF-4B X mRNA complex and functions in an ATP-dependent manner to allow unwinding of the mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1488781666,"Extracellular ATP stimulates transmembrane ion fluxes in the mouse macrophage cell line J774. In the presence of Mg2+, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and other purine and pyrimidine nucleotides do not elicit this response, suggesting the presence of a specific receptor for ATP on the macrophage plasma membrane. One candidate for such a receptor is the ecto-ATPase expressed on these cells. We, therefore, investigated the role of this enzyme in ATP-induced 86Rb+ efflux in J774 cells. The ecto-ATPase had a broad nucleotide specificity and did not hydrolyze extracellular ATP in the absence of divalent cations. 86Rb+ efflux was not blocked by inhibition of the ecto-ATPase and did not require Ca2+ or Mg2+. In fact, ATP-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux was inhibited by Mg2+ and correlated with the availability of ATP4- in the medium. In the absence of divalent cations, the slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs adenosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (ATP-gamma-S) also stimulated 86Rb+ efflux, albeit at higher concentrations than that required for ATP4-. Exposure of J774 cells to 10 mM ATP for 45 min caused death of 95% of cells. By this means we selected variant J774 cells that did not exhibit 86Rb+ efflux in the presence of extracellular ATP but retained ecto-ATPase activity. These results show that the ecto-ATPase of J774 cells does not mediate the effects of ATP on these cells; that ATP4- and not MgATP2- promotes 86Rb+ efflux from these cells; and that hydrolysis of ATP is not required to effect this change in membrane permeability. These findings suggest that J774 cells possess a plasma membrane receptor which binds ATP4-, AMP-PNP, and ATP-gamma-S, and that the ecto-ATPase limits the effects of ATP on these cells by hydrolyzing Mg-ATP2-."
https://openalex.org/W2016122406,"With the recently cloned complementary DNA probe, lambda Am4 for the chromosome 21 gene encoding brain amyloid polypeptide (beta amyloid protein) of Alzheimer's disease, leukocyte DNA from three patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease and two patients with karyotypically normal Down syndrome was found to contain three copies of this gene. Because a small region of chromosome 21 containing the ets-2 gene is duplicated in patients with Alzheimer's disease, as well as in karyotypically normal Down syndrome, duplication of a subsection of the critical segment of chromosome 21 that is duplicated in Down syndrome may be the genetic defect in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2004928211,"In many genetic disorders, the responsible gene and its protein product are unknown. The technique known as ""reverse genetics,"" in which chromosomal map positions and genetically linked DNA markers are used to identify and clone such genes, is complicated by the fact that the molecular distances from the closest DNA markers to the gene itself are often too large to traverse by standard cloning techniques. To address this situation, a general human chromosome jumping library was constructed that allows the cloning of DNA sequences approximately 100 kilobases away from any starting point in genomic DNA. As an illustration of its usefulness, this library was searched for a jumping clone, starting at the met oncogene, which is a marker tightly linked to the cystic fibrosis gene that is located on human chromosome 7. Mapping of the new genomic fragment by pulsed field gel electrophoresis confirmed that it resides on chromosome 7 within 240 kilobases downstream of the met gene. The use of chromosome jumping should now be applicable to any genetic locus for which a closely linked DNA marker is available."
https://openalex.org/W1482513578,"At least 23 soluble proteins (chromobindins) bind to chromaffin granule membranes in the presence of Ca2+. In order to further the identification of the chromobindins and to determine the roles they may play in exocytosis or other aspects of chromaffin cell biology, several of these proteins were compared to other known membrane-binding proteins. Chromobindin 4 was identified as a 32-kDa protein called calelectrin or endonexin. Immunologically related proteins were detected in bovine brain and human platelets. Chromobindin 20 was identified as a 67-kDa variant of calelectrin and was found to have the activities of the synexin inhibitory protein, synhibin. Chromobindin 8 was identified as p36, a substrate for the tyrosine-specific kinase, pp60v-src. Chromobindin 8 was also demonstrated to undergo phosphorylation predominantly on alkali-sensitive sites during stimulation of the chromaffin cell with 20 microM nicotine. Chromobindin 6 was identified as p35, a substrate for the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor. Chromobindin 9, which is known to be a substrate for protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), was found to be immunologically related to p35 and may be a precursor of chromobindin 6. The identification of these proteins from the chromaffin system may be useful in the characterization of similar, complex groups of membrane-binding proteins that have been observed in other systems."

https://openalex.org/W1604280960,"The selenium in mammalian glutathione peroxidase is present as a selenocysteine ([Se]Cys) moiety incorporated into the peptide backbone 41-47 residues from the N-terminal end. To study the origin of the skeleton of the [Se]Cys moiety, we perfused isolated rat liver with 14C- or 3H-labeled amino acids for 4 h, purified the GSH peroxidase, derivatized the [Se]Cys in GSH peroxidase to carboxymethylselenocysteine ([Se]Cys(Cm)), and determined the amino acid specific activity. Perfusion with [14C]cystine resulted in [14C]cystine incorporation into GSH peroxidase without labeling [Se]Cys(Cm), indicating that cysteine is not a direct precursor for [Se]Cys. [14C]Serine perfusion labeled serine, glycine (the serine hydroxymethyltransferase product), and [Se]Cys(Cm) in purified GSH peroxidase, whereas [3-3H]serine perfusion only labeled serine and [Se]Cys(Cm), thus demonstrating that the [Se]Cys in GSH peroxidase is derived from serine. The similar specific activities of serine and [Se]Cys(Cm) strongly suggest that the precursor pool of serine used for [Se] Cys synthesis is the same or similar to the serine pool used for acylation of seryl-tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1590558744,"Primary neuronal cultures from fetal rat brain were utilized to investigate the possible role of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in neuronal growth and differentiation. 125I-IGF-I binding to intact cultured neurons was specific and saturable with an apparent Kd of 7.0 +/- 1.2 nM and a Bmax of 1.8 +/- 0.3 pmol/mg protein. Binding of 125I-IGF-I to neurons was inhibited by IGF-I, followed by IGF-II and insulin. 7 S nerve growth factor, but not beta-nerve growth factor, also inhibited 125I-IGF-I binding. A similar binding site was detected on brain membranes. Affinity cross-linking of 125I-IGF-I to intact cultured neurons revealed, under reducing conditions, a major binding moiety with an Mr of 115,000 and a minor component at Mr 260,000. The former represents a neuronal type of the IGF-I receptor alpha subunit, whereas the latter probably represents an alpha dimer. The Mr = 115,000 binding component for 125I-IGF-I was also present in membranes prepared from postnatal whole brain. In contrast, the binding moiety in cultured glial cells was of Mr = 135,000, which was identical to the IGF-I receptor alpha subunit of placenta. Thus mature brain, despite its cellular heterogeneity, expresses a structural subtype of IGF-I receptor which appears to be unique to differentiated neurons. Moreover, glial and neuronal cultures secreted a polypeptide which specifically bound IGF-I; the apparent Mr of this binding protein was determined by affinity cross-linking to be approximately 35,000. The presence of neuronal IGF-I receptors and binding proteins suggested that IGF-I may exert neurotrophic effects on developing neurons. This possibility was supported by the observation that IGF-I markedly stimulated neuronal RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1657305554,"Administration to normal rats of 100 mg of streptozotocin/kg body weight produced ketotic diabetic rats in which the affinity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase for malonyl-CoA was decreased by 10-fold and its activity was increased by 30%, but the injection of insulin brought the affinity and the activity back to normal within 4 h. Administration of 60 mg of streptozotocin/kg produced non-ketotic diabetic rats and caused a less substantial change in the affinity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase for malonyl-CoA. In the BB Wistar diabetic rat, the onset of diabetes also increased the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and decreased its affinity for malonyl-CoA. Injection of insulin brought both of these values back to normal within 2 h. The total activity of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase (outer + inner activities) was 40% greater in the BB Wistar diabetic rat, but treatment with insulin did not decrease the total activity to normal values within 2 h. The elevated activity and decreased affinity for malonyl-CoA found in fasting rats did not respond to short-term insulin treatment. The evaluation of a previous report that cycloheximide blocks the effects of starvation indicated that cycloheximide did not act by inhibiting protein synthesis, but produced its effect by preventing gastric emptying. Current data suggest that diabetes increases the activity of carnitine palmitoyltransferase and greatly diminishes the affinity of the enzyme for malonyl-CoA and that the severity of diabetes is associated with differences in the affinity of the enzyme for its inhibitor. Insulin acts on the outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase to reverse these effects very rapidly, but diabetes produces some change in the total activity that is not reversed by short-term treatment with insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1497160593,"The serum amyloid P component (SAP) is a precursor glycoprotein of amyloid P component found in all types of amyloid deposits. The binding of human SAP to heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate was studied using Sepharose-immobilized SAP. The apparent dissociation constants of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate for immobilized-SAP were estimated to be approximately 2 X 10(-7) M in the presence of 2 mM CaCl2 at neutral pH and physiological ionic strength. Both the binding affinity of SAP for these glycosaminoglycans and the numbers of binding sites of SAP depended on calcium concentration. Cadmium partially substituted for calcium as an activator of glycosaminoglycan binding to SAP. No binding occurs in the absence of added metal, or in the presence of barium, copper, magnesium, manganese, and strontium. The calcium-dependent binding of [3H]heparan sulfate and [3H]dermatan sulfate to SAP was strongly inhibited by heparan sulfate, heparin, and dermatan sulfate. Chondroitin 6-sulfate was a moderate inhibitor, whereas hyaluronic acid, chondroitin 4-sulfate, and keratan sulfate were not potent inhibitors. The calcium-dependent binding of amyloid P component to heparan sulfate and/or dermatan sulfate may be a cause of the coexistence of the particular glycoprotein and these glycosaminoglycans in amyloid tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2029961931,"We have detected a cellular factor in F9 teratocarcinoma cells that recognizes an adenovirus E1A inducible promoter. This factor, termed E2F, was previously identified in HeLa cells and was found at increased levels as a function of the E1A gene product. Upon differentiation of F9 cells with retinoic acid and cAMP, the factor declines to near undetectable levels, consistent with the control of this factor by E1A and the presence of a cellular E1A-like activity in F9 cells but not in differentiated F9 cells. Finally, if the E1A gene is introcuced into differentiated cells by an adenovirus infection, there is a large increase in the level of the factor. We suggest that the control of E2F during F9 differentiation is indeed due to an E1A-like activity."
https://openalex.org/W1623075183,"Lon protease from Escherichia coli degraded lambda N protein in a reaction mixture consisting of the two homogeneous proteins, ATP, and MgCl2 in 50 mM Tris, Ph 8.0. Genetic and biochemical data had previously indicated that N protein is a substrate for Lon protease in vivo (Gottesman, S., Gottesman, M., Shaw, J. E., and Pearson, M. L. (1981) Cell 24, 225-233). Under conditions used for N protein degradation, several lambda and E. coli proteins, including native proteins, oxidatively modified proteins, and cloned fragments of native proteins, were not degraded by Lon protease. Degradation of N protein occurred with catalytic amounts of Lon protease and required the presence of ATP or an analog of ATP. This is the first demonstration of the selective degradation of a physiological substrate by Lon protease in vitro. The turnover number for N protein degradation was approximately 60 +/- 10 min-1 at pH 8.0 in 50 mM Tris/HCl, 25 mM MgCl2 and 4 mM ATP. By comparison the turnover number for oxidized insulin B chain was 20 min-1 under these conditions. Kinetic studies suggest that N protein (S0.5 = 13 +/- 5 microM) is intermediate between oxidized insulin B chain (S0.5 = 160 +/- 10 microM) and methylated casein (S0.5 = 2.5 +/- 1 microM) in affinity for Lon protease. N protein was extensively degraded by Lon protease with an average of approximately six bonds cleaved per molecule. In N protein, as well as in oxidized insulin B chain and glucagon, Lon protease preferentially cut at bonds at which the carboxy group was contributed by an amino acid with an aliphatic side chain (leucine or alanine). However, not all such bonds of the substrates were cleaved, indicating that sequence or conformational determinants beyond the cleavage site affect the ability of Lon protease to degrade a protein."
https://openalex.org/W1579490087,"Abstract Previous studies had led to the conclusion that the globular, single-headed myosins IA and IB from Acanthamoeba castellanii contain two actin-binding sites: one associated with the catalytic site and whose binding to F-actin activates the Mg2+-ATPase activity and a second site whose binding results in the cross-linking of actin filaments and makes the actin-activated ATPase activity positively cooperative with respect to myosin I concentration. We have now prepared a 100,000-Da NH2-terminal peptide and a 30,000-Da COOH-terminal peptide by alpha-chymotryptic digestion of the myosin IA heavy chain. The intact 17,000-Da light chain remained associated with the 100,000-Da fragment, which also contained the serine residue that must be phosphorylated for expression of actin-activated ATPase activity by native myosin IA. The 30,000-Da peptide, which contained 34% glycine and 21% proline, bound to F-actin with a KD less than 0.5 microM in the presence or absence of ATP but had no ATPase activity. The 100,000-Da peptide bound to F-actin with KD = 0.4-0.8 microM in the presence of 2 mM MgATP and KD less than 0.01 microM in the absence of MgATP. In contrast to native myosin IA, neither peptide cross-linked actin filaments. The phosphorylated 100,000-Da peptide had actin-activated ATPase activity with the same Vmax as that of native phosphorylated myosin IA but this activity displayed simple, noncooperative hyperbolic dependence on the actin concentration in contrast to the complex cooperative kinetics observed with native myosin IA. These results provide direct experimental evidence for the presence of two actin-binding sites on myosin IA, as was suggested by enzyme kinetic and filament cross-linking data, and also for the previously proposed mechanism by which monomeric myosins I could support contractile activities."

https://openalex.org/W1520688290,"The metabolism of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, a major product of human colon carcinoma cells, was investigated in a series of pulse-chase experiments using a combination of quantitative biochemistry and electron microscope autoradiography. This was possible primarily because these cells incorporate [35S]sulfate exclusively into heparan sulfate proteoglycan, thus allowing the possibility of correlating the two sets of information. The results showed a progressive movement of the newly synthesized proteoglycan from the Golgi to the cell surface, where it became closely associated with the plasma membrane and was labeled ultrastructurally by both ruthenium red and radiosulfate. Subsequently, about 55% was released into the medium (t1/2 approximately 2.5 h) where it resided as intact macromolecule and was neither endocytosed nor degraded further. The remaining 45% was internalized and converted into smaller species through a series of degradative steps. Initially (Step 1) there was proteolytic cleavage of the protein core and partial endoglycosidic cleavage of the heparan sulfate chains (t1/2 approximately 6 h), with generation of larger glycosaminoglycan-peptide intermediates with chains of Mr approximately 10,000, about one-third their original size. These components were subsequently converted (Step 2) to yet smaller, limiting fragments of Mr approximately 5,000, which were finally depolymerized (Step 3) with quantitative release of free sulfate. The intracellular degradation of the proteoglycan, particularly Steps 2 and 3, was markedly inhibited by choloroquine, implicating the involvement of acidic compartments in the catabolism of these macromolecules. This was corroborated by the autoradiographic studies which showed the close association of 35S-labeled products with secondary lysosomes. However, the initial degradation of the proteoglycan might have occurred in a prelysosomal compartment since Step 1 was not totally blocked by chloroquine. The combined results indicate that the intracellular degradation of heparan sulfate follows structural as well as functional compartmentalization and provide a model that may be shared by other cell systems."
https://openalex.org/W1555616833,"This report describes studies designed to evaluate possible inhibitory effects of diaminoantifolates on folate-dependent biosynthetic enzymes in intact L1210 leukemia cells. A novel approach is described which involves an assessment of the metabolism of and biosynthetic flux of the one-carbon moiety from (6S)5-formyltetrahydrofolate in folate-depleted cells. Pretreatment with methotrexate (10 microM), resulting in the formation of methotrexate polyglutamates, or continuous incubation with trimetrexate (1 microM) inhibited growth of folate-depleted L1210 cells in the presence of folic acid or 5-formyltetrahydrolate. In both control and drug-treated cells, double-labeled (6S)-5-[14C]formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate was rapidly metabolized with the loss of the [14C]formyl group. Under all conditions, the predominant metabolite was 10-formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate, detectable both intracellularly and extracellularly. In drug-treated cells, there was a remarkably small decrease in the level of 10-formyl[3H]tetrahydrofolate (approximately 30%) and a 10-fold rise in the level of [3H]dihydrofolate to less than 20% of the total folate pool. The incorporation of [14C]formyl group from 5-[14C]formyltetrahydrofolate into thymidylate, serine, and methionine was unaffected by the presence of 1 microM trimetrexate, consistent with the generation of sufficient 5,10-[14C]methylenetetrahydrofolate to drive these reactions. Similarly, the presence of methotrexate polyglutamates had no effect at the level of amino acid synthesis; however, carbon transfer into thymidylate was markedly inhibited. Even though 10-formyltetrahydrofolate was readily formed from 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in this model, the net incorporation of 14C from 5-[14C]formyltetrahydrofolate into purine nucleotides was inhibited by both methotrexate and trimetrexate treatments. Similar findings were obtained when [14C]glycine incorporation into purine nucleotides was monitored in cells incubated with unlabeled 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. Finally, in antifolate-treated cells incubated with unlabeled 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, transfer of 14C from [14C]formate or [14C]serine into biosynthetic products or incorporation of [3H]deoxyuridine into nucleic acids was potently inhibited. These results suggest that insufficient levels of tetrahydrofolate and 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate were formed to drive these reactions despite the presence of high levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1592095860,"Kinetic properties of regulatory enzymes of glycolysis in liver of the mouse, Zapus hudsonius, were modified during hibernation, the probable mechanism being covalent modification. Liver glycogen phosphorylase activity was strongly depressed during both short (less than 24 h) and long (5-8 days) term hibernation, the mechanism involving a decrease in both the percentage of enzyme in the active a form and the total amount (a + b) of enzyme expressed. Phosphofructokinase showed kinetic changes (a 2.5-fold increase in Ka for fructose-2,6-P2, 4- and 3.7-fold decreases in I50 values for ATP and citrate, compared to euthermic controls) in liver of hibernators indicative of phosphorylation inactivation of the enzyme. Measured levels of fructose-2,6-P2 in liver did not change during hibernation. Changes in pyruvate kinase kinetics in liver from long term hibernators similarly indicated enzyme phosphorylation in the depressed state (Ka for fructose-1,6-P2 increased 4.4-fold, I50 for L-alanine decreased 6.3-fold). Apparent covalent modification of glycolytic enzymes during hibernation may serve two functions: depression of glycolytic activity as part of the general metabolic rate depression of hibernation, or reorganization of fuel use in the hibernating state to limit carbohydrate catabolism and promote gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1532050495,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to probe the regulatory nucleotide site of the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum and to study its relationship with the catalytic nucleotide site. Our approach was to use the nucleotide analogue 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrocyclohexadienylidene)adenosine 5'-phosphate (TNP-AMP), which is known to bind the Ca2+-ATPase with high affinity and to undergo a manyfold increase in fluorescence upon enzyme phosphorylation with ATP in the presence of Ca2+. TNP-AMP was shown to bind the regulatory site in that it competitively inhibited (Ki = 0.6 microM) the secondary activation of turnover induced by millimolar ATP, thus providing a high affinity probe for the site. Observation of the high phosphoenzyme-dependent fluorescence upon monomerization of the enzyme without an increase in phosphoenzyme levels showed the regulatory site to be on the same subunit as the catalytic site and excluded an uncovering of silent nucleotide sites resulting from dissociation of enzyme subunits. Identical stoichiometric levels of [3H]TNP-AMP binding (4 nmol/mg of protein) to either the free enzyme or the enzyme phosphorylated with 250 microM ATP excluded models of two nucleotide sites per subunit. Finally, transient kinetic experiments in which TNP-AMP was found to block the ADP-induced burst of phosphoenzyme decomposition showed that TNP-AMP was bound to the phosphorylated catalytic site. We conclude that the regulatory nucleotide site is not a separate and distinct site on the Ca2+-ATPase but, rather, results from the nucleotide catalytic site following formation of the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1516535598,"The GTPase activity of plasma membranes isolated from rat livers was stimulated 20% over basal by vasopressin. A concentration dependency curve showed that maximal stimulation was obtained with 10(-8) M vasopressin. The vasopressin-stimulated GTPase activity was not inhibited in plasma membranes that had been ADP-ribosylated with either cholera toxin or pertussis toxin. Identical results were obtained from plasma membranes that had been solubilized with 1% digitonin. When membranes that had been solubilized after preincubation with [3H]vasopressin were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation, the majority of protein-bound [3H]vasopressin migrated as a single band with a sedimentation constant of 16.8 S. Moreover, there was a GTPase activity that migrated with the bound [3H]vasopressin. This peak of bound [3H]vasopressin was decreased by 90% when the sucrose gradient centrifugation was run in the presence of 10 microM guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate). When the 16.8 S peak of bound [3H]vasopressin was further purified over a wheat germ lectin-Sepharose column, a GTPase activity co-eluted from the column with the protein-bound [3H]vasopressin. Direct evidence that a GTP-binding protein was present in the 16.8 S peak was obtained by the immunodetection of a 35-kDa beta subunit of a GTP-binding protein. These results support the conclusion that liver plasma membranes contain a GTP-binding protein that can complex with the vasopressin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1488678007,"A crucial enzyme in the pathway for protein degradation in Escherichia coli is protease La, an ATP-hydrolyzing protease encoded by the lon gene. This enzyme degrades various proteins to small polypeptides containing 10-20 amino acid residues. To learn more about its energy requirement, we determined the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed by the purified protease for each peptide bond cleaved. The enzyme hydrolyzed about 2 molecules of ATP for each new amino group generated with casein, bovine serum albumin, glucagon, or guanidinated casein as substrates, even though these proteins differ up to 20-fold in size and 3-4 fold in rates of hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Similar values for the stoichiometry (from 1.9 to 2.4) were obtained using fluorescamine or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid to estimate the appearance of new amino groups. These values appeared lower at 1 mM than at 10 mM Mg2+. The coupling between ATP and peptide bond hydrolysis appeared very tight. However, when the protease was assayed under suboptimal conditions (e.g. at lower pH or with ADP present), many more ATP molecules (from 3.5 to 12) were consumed per peptide bond cleaved. Our data would indicate that the early steps in protein degradation consume almost as much energy (2 ATPs for each cleavage) as does the formation of peptide bonds during protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1518153536,"The galR gene, which encodes the Gal repressor protein in Escherichia coli, has been fused to the strong pL promoter of bacteriophage lambda in plasmid pKC31. The pL promoter is kept repressed by a thermolabilie lambda repressor, CIts857, to prevent cell killing. Heat induction of the pL-galR fusion plasmid synthesizes large amounts of active Gal repressor. The protein has been purified to homogeneity in three steps. The purification is greatly aided by the reversible insolubility of active repressor in crude extract at salt concentrations of less than 200 mM. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence determined by automated Edman degradation is: N-Ala-Thr-Ile-Lys-Asp-Val-Ala-Arg-Leu-Ala-Gly-Val-Ser-Val-Ala-Thr-Val-. Comparison of this sequence with that deduced from the DNA sequence of the galR gene showed that the formyl methionine residue preceding alanine at position 1 is cleaved off. The repressor is present in solution as a dimer of a 37-kDa subunit. The protein binds to gal DNA containing wild type and not mutant operator sequences. As predicted, this sequence-specific binding is inhibited by the presence of D-galactose or D-fucose, both of which are in vivo inducers of the gal operon. Gal repressor inhibits the expresison of gal operon by binding to two spatially separated operators which flank, but do not overlap, the gal promoter segment. Experiments to study the mechanism of repressor action are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536295628,"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) were solubilized from human lung fibroblast monolayers with detergent. Presumptive membrane-associated forms displaying hydrophobic properties were purified by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-4B, by ion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q and by incorporation in lipid vesicles. The HSPG preparations were 125I-iodinated and treated with heparitinase before sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five radiolabeled proteins with apparent molecular weights of 125,000, 90,000, 64,000, 48,000, and 35,000 were visualized by autoradiography. A sixth protein, identified in nonreduced 125I-HSPG preparations, appeared as a non-HS chain-bearing Mr 35,000 peptide which was disulfide-linked to an HS chain-bearing peptide of similar size. This multiplicity of core proteins did not seem to result from proteolysis during the heparitinase treatment itself, since some of the core proteins migrated independently during gel filtration before heparitinase digestion. Moreover, heparitinase digestion of 125I-HSPG purified by affinity chromatography on an immobilized monoclonal antibody yielded only the Mr 64,000 protein. Alternative depolymerizations of the HS chains by heparinase or HNO2 also yielded multiple protein bands. These results imply that heterogeneity of the core protein moiety may be a genuine property of the hydrophobic HSPG of human lung fibroblasts. The occurrence of multiple integral membrane HSPG forms may be relevant for the multiple functions that have been ascribed to cell-surface HSPG."
https://openalex.org/W1561924747,"The regulation of lysosomal cystine transport was studied using cystine dimethyl ester-loaded lysosomes isolated from human diploid fibroblasts. Net efflux from normal fibroblast lysosomes was compared to that from lysosomes of cystinotic fibroblasts, which contain an inherited mutation decreasing lysosomal cystine transport. This exodus of cystine from normal fibroblast lysosomes was greater than from cystinotic fibroblast lysosomes. When lysosomes were incubated with both 5 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP (Mg/ATP), the amount of lysosomal cystine lost from normal lysosomes doubled, but the amount of cystine lost from cystinotic lysosomes remained small. This effect of Mg/ATP on cystine loss from lysosomes isolated from normal fibroblasts was abolished when either carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or N-ethylmaleimide was present, suggesting that the effect of Mg/ATP was mediated by the action of a lysosomal proton-translocating ATPase. Addition of KCl, RbCl, or NaCl to normal lysosomes caused smaller increases in cystine exodus. A variety of experimental conditions altered lysosomal pH, membrane potential, and the cystine lost from normal fibroblast lysosomes. These same experimental conditions produced similar alterations in the lysosomal pH and membrane potential of cystinotic fibroblast lysosomes without a comparable alteration in cystine loss. These results have led us to propose a model in which the transport of cystine out of the normal lysosome is regulated by both the lysosomal membrane potential gradient and the transmembrane pH gradient."
https://openalex.org/W1514472306,"Glutaraldehyde treatment of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles results in formation of cross-linked Ca2+-ATPase oligomers. Under limiting reaction conditions, where minimal interpolypeptide cross-linking occurs, hydrodynamic properties of the monomer are altered, such that, on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the enzyme migrates with an apparent molecular weight of 125,000 (E(125], as compared to the native enzyme (E(110]. The E(125) species was also formed following reaction with other cross-linking bis-aldehydes, with formaldehyde and with a bissuccinimidyl ester. Derivitization resulted in inactivation of ATPase activity and of phosphoprotein formation from Pi. E(125) formation was inhibited by ATP, ADP, AMPPCP, and orthovanadate, and by specific modification of active site Lys-514 with fluorescein-5'-isothiocyanate. Tryptic cleavage patterns of the glutaraldehyde-modified enzyme were consistent with covalent linkage of A1 and B fragments that have been postulated to comprise the phosphorylation and nucleotide-binding domains (MacLennan, D. H., Brandt, C. J., Korczak, B., and Green, N. M. (1985) Nature 316, 696-700). The denaturing detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, prevented cross-link formation. Interdomain cross-linking was inhibited by prior modification with either 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonate, phenylglyoxal, or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate but was unaffected by thiol group modification with iodoacetate or N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting involvement of lysine residues. These findings indicate that intramolecular cross-linking at the active site of the Ca2+-ATPase involves phosphorylation- and ATP-binding domains that are widely separated in the linear sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1636709211,"The effects of insulin and increased cardiac work on glycolytic rate, metabolite content, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2) content were studied in isolated perfused rat hearts. Steady-state rates of glycolysis increased 5-fold with the addition of insulin to the perfusate or by increasing cardiac pressure-volume work and correlated well in most conditions with changes in substrate concentration (Fru-6-P) and with concentration of the activator, Fru-2,6-P2. There was no correlation with changes in other well known regulators including citrate, ATP, AMP, Pi, or cytosolic phosphorylation potential. Using phosphofructokinase purified from hearts perfused under identical conditions, allosteric kinetic experiments were performed using the metabolite and effector concentrations determined from in vivo experiments. Reaction rates for phosphofructokinase calculated in vitro agreed well with the glycolytic rates measured in vivo and correlated with changes in Fru-6-P but not with other effectors. However, higher Fru-2,6-P2 levels were more effective in maintaining phosphofructokinase activity at high ATP and citrate levels. Kinetic experiments did not indicate a covalent modification of phosphofructokinase. These data indicate that control of cardiac phosphofructokinase and glycolysis may be accomplished by changes in the availability of substrate, Fru-6-P, and activator, Fru-2,6-P2, rather than by citrate, adenine nucleotides, or cytosolic phosphorylation potential as previously suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1595546948,"Synthetic 75-base pair promoters bearing base changes and/or base analog substitutions at selected positions were constructed. Using both abortive initiation and run-off transcription assays, the interaction of these altered promoters with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase was studied in order to determine the involvement of DNA functional groups in promoter recognition. Two adjacent thymines in the -35 region were identified whose 5-methyl groups play a crucial role. Additionally, the combined results from several substitution experiments showed that functional groups in the major groove of the strongly conserved T-A base pair at the -7 position are probable sites of direct interaction with RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1549682544,"Dynein 1 was extracted from sperm flagella of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla with 0.6 M NaCl and dialyzed against 0.5 mM EDTA, 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mM imidazole/HCl buffer, pH 7.0, for 24-48 h. In some cases, fractions containing the alpha heavy chain and the beta/intermediate chain 1 complex (beta/IC1) were separated by density gradient centrifugation in the same solution. Treatment of the samples at a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:10 w/w for 32 min at room temperature yields a crude digest from which Fragment A is purified by density gradient centrifugation. The purified Fragment A consists of two principal peptides (Mr = 195,000 and 130,000) that cosediment with the peak of ATPase activity at 12.5 S, which is slightly faster than the 11 S of the original beta/IC1 complex. When digests of the separated alpha chain and of the beta/IC1 complex are followed as a function of time, the early cleavages of the two heavy chains (Mr = 428,000) resemble each other in that both lead to similarly sized peptides of Mr 316,000 and 296,000, but only in the beta/IC1 fraction does the digestion proceed to form Fragment A. The remainder of the beta chain, termed Fragment B, occurs as an Mr 110,000 peptide sedimenting at 5.7 S with no associated ATPase activity. Fragment A has a specific ATPase activity of 4.3 mumol Pi X min-1 X mg-1, with a Km of 29 microM in 0.1 M NaCl medium, and an apparent Ki for inhibition by vanadate of 1.2 microM in the absence of salt, and 22 microM in 0.6 M NaCl. Photoaffinity labeling with [alpha-32P]8-azidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate indicates that the ATP binding site on the beta chain of dynein 1 is located on the Mr 195,000 peptide of Fragment A. The possibility that Fragments A and B of the beta/IC1 complex may correspond to the head and tail regions of the tadpole-shaped particle seen by electron microscopy is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2138404748,"Generalized recombination in Escherichia coli is elevated near Chi sites. In vitro, RecBCD enzyme can nick Chi a few nucleotides 3' of the terminal GG of the Chi sequence (5'-GCTGGTGG). The simplest model in which this nick at Chi participates in Chi function predicts that in phage lambda, Chi-stimulated recombinants not crossed-over for flanking markers (patches) should be heteroduplex, with recombinant information on the lambda I chain. I report here that patches are heteroduplex, but that recombinant information occurs primarily on the lambda r chain. This result rules out the simplest model in which the nick at Chi promotes initiation of recombination, forces reconsideration of Chi's role in recombination, and bears on molecular models for Rec-mediated recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1561240465,"We have previously shown that liver plasma membrane (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity is inhibited by glucagon. To investigate the possible involvement of a GTP-binding (G) protein in this regulation, we have examined the effects of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin on inhibition of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase by glucagon. Treatment of liver plasma membranes with pertussis toxin did not affect the sensitivity of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase to the hormone. In contrast, treatment of plasma membranes or prior injection of animals with cholera toxin prevented inhibition of the (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase by glucagon. Even though adenylate cyclase activity was increased by cholera toxin treatment, addition of cyclic AMP did not mimic the effect of cholera toxin in blocking glucagon-mediated inhibition of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity. These data suggest that a cholera toxin-sensitive protein, perhaps Gs or a Gs-like protein, is involved in the regulation of liver (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity. The results emphasize the possible role of Gs-like proteins in regulation of enzymes other than adenylate cyclase and suggest that the study of (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase may provide a useful enzymatic system to examine such regulation."
https://openalex.org/W91769349,"Abstract In the present study we examined factors affecting the reversal of the ischemia-induced protonic inhibition of the mitochondrial ATPase described earlier (Rouslin, W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 9657-9661). It was found that ATPase reactivation and accompanying inhibitor protein release during the re-energization of intact mitochondria isolated from 20-min ischemic canine heart muscle could be blocked completely by either carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) or nigericin but was unaffected by valinomycin at 35 mM K+. At higher K+ concentrations, valinomycin also blocked ATPase reactivation but not quite as completely as did nigericin. These observations suggest that ATPase reactivation and inhibitor protein release are particularly dependent upon either the trans-inner membrane pH gradient (delta pH) or possibly upon matrix pH per se and slightly less dependent upon membrane potential (delta psi) in intact cardiac muscle mitochondria. The addition of FCCP at the end of the re-energization incubations limited partially the extent of both ATPase reactivation and inhibitor protein release. This latter effect appears to have been mediated by a partial reassociation of the inhibitor protein with the enzyme, and it was accentuated (when FCCP was added at the end of the incubations) or mimicked (when FCCP was absent) by lowering the pH of the re-energization medium. A close examination of the first 10 min of the time course of enzyme activation and of inhibitor protein release revealed that while the former process was essentially finished in 1 min or less, the latter required approximately 10 min for completion. This observation led to the proposal of a two-site model of enzyme-inhibitor interaction which is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1576088629,"To clarify the physiological role of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in the perinatal switching of myocardial fuels from carbohydrate to fatty acids, the kinetic effects of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate on phosphofructokinase purified from fetal and adult rat hearts were compared. For both enzymes at physiological pH and ATP concentrations, 1 microM fructose 2,6-bisphosphate induced a greater than 10-fold reduction in S0.5 for fructose 6-phosphate and it completely eliminated subunit cooperativity. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate may thereby reduce the influence of changes in fructose 6-phosphate concentration on phosphofructokinase activity. Based on double-reciprocal plots and ATP inhibition studies, adult heart phosphofructokinase activity is more sensitive to physiological changes in ATP and citrate concentrations than to changes in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentrations. Fetal heart phosphofructokinase is less sensitive to ATP concentration above 5 mM and equally sensitive to citrate inhibition. The fetal enzyme has up to a 15-fold lower affinity for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, rendering it more sensitive to changes in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate concentration than adult heart phosphofructokinase. Together, these factors allow greater phosphofructokinase activity in fetal heart while retaining sensitive metabolic control. In both fetal and adult heart, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is primarily permissive: it abolishes subunit cooperativity and in its presence phosphofructokinase activity is extraordinarily sensitive to both the energy balance of the cell as reflected in ATP concentration and the availability of other fuels as reflected in cytosolic citrate concentration."
https://openalex.org/W1527077584,"Conjugation of natural bilirubin (BR) depends on a hepatic microsomal UDP-glycosyltransferase using UDP-Glc, UDP-xylose, and predominantly UDP-GlcA. We found that esterification of BR occurred when washed intact microsomes derived from rat or guinea pig liver were incubated with BR in the absence of added UDP-sugar. This endogenous esterification was shown to lead predominantly to formation of the two positional isomers of BR monoglucoside and displayed the same regioselectivity as found for the BR monoglucosides formed by microsomes incubated with a saturating concentration of added UDP-Glc. This finding and absence of endogenous esterification in liver microsomes from mutant rats lacking BR UDP-glycosyltransferase activities demonstrated that endogenous esterification depended on UDP-glycosyltransferase and indicated, therefore, that UDP-Glc was present in the intact microsomal vesicles. With UDP-Glc added to the extramicrosomal incubation medium, BR glucosidation was markedly enhanced when the membrane permeability barrier was disrupted by pretreatment of the microsomes with detergent, sonication, or Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. In contrast, such membrane disruption resulted in abolishment of endogenous esterification of BR, and a direct relationship was found between impairment of endogenous esterification and degree of vesicle disruption, suggesting that the UDP-Glc on which endogenous esterification depended was present in the lumenal space of the microsomes. Kinetic evidence and absence of an effect of increasing the microsomal concentration of dolichol-P-Glc (Dol-P-Glc) on endogenous esterification excluded direct or indirect involvement of Dol-P-Glc in the endogenous esterification reaction. Preincubation of intact microsomes with UDP-Glc or UDP-xylose at 37 degrees C, but not at 0 degrees C, led to expansion of the microsomal UDP-sugar pool on which endogenous esterification depended, suggesting that both UDP-sugars can enter the microsomal vesicles by a temperature-dependent mechanism. In contrast to these findings, no increase of BR esterification was detected when the microsomes had been preincubated at 37 degrees C with UDP-GlcA. We conclude that native, intact microsomes contain a lumenal pool of endogenous UDP-Glc and that BR UDP-glucosyltransferase and UDP-xylosyltransferase, by virtue of a lumenal orientation, have direct access to the postulated intramicrosomal pool of nucleotide sugar."
https://openalex.org/W1495978543,"Conflicting reports have appeared concerning the effect of [Mg2+] on muscle activity. Several groups have found that increasing [Mg2+] produces a right-ward shift of the pCa-tension curve, while others have found no effect of [Mg2+] on myofibrillar ATPase activity. The present study is a careful evaluation of the effect of [Mg2+] on myofibrillar ATPase, skinned fiber tension development, TnCDANZ (troponin C (TnC)-labeled with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl aziridine) fluorescence, and simultaneous TnCDANZ fluorescence and tension development in the same fiber. A small effect of [Mg2+] on both ATPase and tension development was found with an apparent association constant of about 2 X 10(2) M-1. The Ca2+ dependence of TnCDANZ fluorescence was similarly effected by [Mg2+], either alone or when incorporated into TnC-depleted skinned fibers (K'Mg approximately equal to 2-3 X 10(2) M-1), suggesting that the effect of [Mg2+] on activity is due to an effect of [Mg2+] on Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific sites of TnC. It is not yet clear whether this effect of [Mg2+] is through direct competition at the binding sites or through indirect effects. In either case, the calculated effect of physiological [Mg2+] is so small that the regulatory sites of TnC can still be considered Ca2+-specific. In addition, a slightly greater effect of [Mg2+] on tension development (K'Mg = 4.62 X 10(2) M-1) was observed only for very low levels of [Mg2+], which might suggest an additional effect of Mg2+ on tension development which is saturated by millimolar Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1603344804,"The human B-cell line Namalwa expresses the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA). Frame-shift mutants in Namalwa cell cultures were generated with ICR-191, and mutants were then selected for resistance to ricin or resistance to a conjugate of ricin with the anti-CALLA antibody J5 in the presence of lactose. Three mutants were found that were resistant to ricin and were in addition shown to be resistant to diphtheria toxin, to a J5-ricin conjugate, and to a conjugate between ricin B-chain and gelonin. The mutants, however, were sensitive to a J5-gelonin conjugate. These mutants expressed high levels of CALLA and/or receptors for ricin, and their cell-free translation systems appeared to be as sensitive to the inhibitory action of ricin A-chain and of gelonin as the translation system of wild-type Namalwa cells. The behavior of these mutants was consistent with the hypothesis that these cells possess an alteration of their surface that impedes the passage of ricin and diphtheria toxin across the plasma membrane. A fourth mutant was found to bind reduced quantities of ricin and was resistant to ricin but was sensitive to J5-ricin. The properties of this cell line provide evidence that the binding of antibody-ricin conjugates to cells via the ricin moiety may be prevented without impeding the cytotoxicity of the conjugates."
https://openalex.org/W1564139829,"A pure bovine phospholamban sample was phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase maximally to about 1 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Mr 25,000), whereas phospholamban purified from bovine cardiac SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum) vesicle prephosphorylated by the protein kinase was found to contain 4.6 mol of phosphate/mol of phospholamban. The decrease in phospholamban phosphorylation occurred during the protein purification at the immunoaffinity chromatography step. The protein phosphorylation could be restored by the addition of the affinity column flow-through fraction to the phosphorylation reaction. The phosphorylation-stimulating activity of the flow-through fraction was resistant to boiling and trypsin treatment and extractable by organic solvent, suggesting that the endogenous factor(s) is lipid. Various phospholipids were found capable of stimulating the phosphorylation of phospholamban by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, but only phosphatidylinositol could stimulate the protein phosphorylation to a level achieved by the phosphorylation of SR membrane-bound phospholamban, about 5 mol of phosphate/mol. Phospholamban phosphorylated in the presence of phosphatidylinositol showed similar sites of phosphorylation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis mobility shifts as the phospholamban isolated from phosphorylated SR vesicles. Results of the present study suggest that phospholamban in SR is embedded in a phosphatidylinositol-rich microenvironment, and that this specific environment may be important for the regulation of Ca2+ pump by phospholamban."
https://openalex.org/W1494684747,"The mechanism of the sucrose synthetase reaction has been probed by the technique of positional isotope exchange. [beta-18O2, alpha beta-18O]UDP-Glc has been synthesized starting from oxygen-18-labeled phosphate and the combined activities of carbamate kinase, hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, and uridine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase. The oxygen-18 at the alpha beta-bridge position of the labeled UDP-Glc has been shown to cause a 0.014 ppm upfield chemical shift in the 31P NMR spectrum of both the alpha- and beta-phosphorus atoms in UDP-Glc relative to the unlabeled compound. The chemical shift induced by each of the beta-nonbridge oxygen-18 atoms was 0.030 ppm. Incubation of [beta-18O2, alpha beta-18O]UDP-Glc with sucrose synthetase in the presence and absence of 2,5-anhydromannitol did not result in any significant exchange of an oxygen-18 from the beta-nonbridge position to the anomeric oxygen of the glucose moiety. It can thus be concluded that either sucrose synthetase does not catalyze the cleavage of the scissile carbon-oxygen bond of UDP-Glc in the absence of fructose or, alternatively, the beta-phosphoryl group of the newly formed UDP is rotationally immobilized."
