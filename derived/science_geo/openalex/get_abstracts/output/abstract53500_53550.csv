https://openalex.org/W1605839106,"Abstract Rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase has been obtained as a nearly homogeneous protein showing a single peak on electrophoresis and in the ultracentrifuge. Incubation of the purified kinase with γ32P-ATP in the presence of Mg++ ions activates the enzyme; this process is accompanied by phosphorylation of the protein. Activation and phosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase occur more rapidly when cyclic 3',5'-AMP or glycogen is present in activation reaction mixtures, but these two substances apparently act by different mechanisms since their effects are additive. Cyclic 3',5'-AMP and glycogen stimulate activation of the kinase more than they affect phosphorylation. No evidence was obtained to indicate that cyclic 3',5'-AMP undergoes any modification when it exerts its effect on phosphorylase kinase activation. Activation of the kinase was shown to be autocatalytic, but the possibility that cyclic 3',5'-AMP acts through stimulation of a second enzyme involved in the system was suggested by the failure to find any evidence for a significant degree of binding of this nucleotide to purified phosphorylase kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1595192741,"Abstract The role of phospholipid in rat liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase has been investigated with the use of phospholipase A and phospholipase C to alter the microsomal phospholipids. The phospholipase C-treated preparation lost a maximum of 80 to 90% of the original activity, and 70% of the microsomal phospholipid was hydrolyzed. Addition of phospholipid completely restored the original activity. The soluble and insoluble products of the phospholipase C treatment had no effect on the inactivation of glucose 6-phosphatase or the subsequent reactivation by phospholipid. The relative effectiveness of various single and mixed phospholipids, with respect to reactivation of the lipid-deficient, phospholipase C-treated glucose 6-phosphatase, was compared. Lecithin, which represents 53% of the microsomal phospholipid, was essentially all hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, but it was ineffective in reactivation. Phosphatidyl ethanolamine, which represents 23% of the phospholipid, was 60% hydrolyzed by phospholipase C, and it was the most effective individual phospholipid in terms of maximal reactivation. Lysolecithin, a trace component in microsomes, was the most effective phospholipid in reactivation at low concentrations, but inhibited at higher levels. In contrast to the phospholipase C-treated preparation, the phospholipase A-treated samples were quite unstable; i.e. the ability to reactivate glucose 6-phosphatase with phospholipid was rapidly lost. In the presence of bovine serum albumin, a fatty acid-binding agent, there was essentially no loss of activity during incubation with phospholipase A. Lysolecithin, another product of the phospholipase A action, was shown to satisfy the phospholipid requirement of the lipid-deficient phospholipase C-treated preparation; thus, the phospholipase A products have contradictory effects on glucose 6-phosphatase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1503770775,"A procedure is described for the purification from extracts of Escherichia coli of the enzyme that catalyzes the release of carbon 8 of guanosine triphosphate as formic acid. This reaction is the first in a series of steps involved in the conversion of GTP to the pteridine component of folic acid. The enzyme, which has been purified some 700-fold, has been named GTP cyclohydrolase. No purine, nucleoside, or nucleotide other than GTP can be used as substrate. No coenzyme or metal activator is required in the reaction. The Km for GTP has been determined to be 2.2 × 10−5M. The molecular weight of the enzyme has been estimated to be larger than 300,000. The purified enzyme has been shown to catalyze the formation from GTP of formic acid and the triphospho ester of 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(erythro-1′,2′,3′-trihydroxypropyl)dihydropteridine (dihydroneopterin triphosphate) as products. No evidence was obtained to indicate that more than a single protein is involved in this transformation, although theoretical considerations suggest that this phenomenon is the sum of several individual reactions. Evidence is presented which shows that an arsenate-sensitive phosphatase is present in extracts of E. coli and that this enzyme is involved in the dephosphorylation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate, an enzymatic step which is necessary in order for this compound to be converted to dihydropteroic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1579228257,"Abstract Acidic lipids with smooth muscle-stimulating properties were extracted from rat epididymal fat pads and were shown to co-chromatograph with prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), PGE2, and PGF1α. Further chemical identification was not possible with the small amounts of material available. A basal efflux of PGE and PGF compounds was observed following incubation of adipose tissue in vitro. Increased efflux of prosta-glandin was detected under conditions reported to enhance free fatty acid release, i.e. addition of lipolytic hormones or drugs to the incubating medium, prior fasting of the animal, or stimulation of the epididymal nerve. These results, together with a decreased release of prostaglandin-like material in the presence of insulin, suggested that the efflux may be associated with lipolysis resulting from activation of a hormone-sensitive lipase. Since the prostaglandins are known to affect the concentration of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in adipose tissue, and this nucleotide is an intermediary in hormone-stimulated lipolysis, it is possible that the prostaglandins released may serve to maintain the homeostasis of adipose tissue by way of a physiological feedback control mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1524786741,"Abstract Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle reacts rapidly with β-(2-furyl)acryloyl phosphate (FA-phosphate) in aqueous solutions at neutral pH to yield an active site-specific, spectrophotometrically identifiable β-(2-furyl)acryloyl enzyme (FA-enzyme). This acyl-enzyme reacts with arsenate, phosphate, and NADH to give β-(2-furyl)acrylic acid, FA-phosphate, and β-(2-furyl)acrolein, respectively. The ultraviolet spectrum of native FA-enzyme includes, in addition to the protein absorption bands, a strong absorption band with λmax at 344 mµ. On denaturation this absorption maximum shifts to the maximum observed for a corresponding furylacryloyl thiol ester (337 mµ). The formation of acyl-enzyme in excess of FA-phosphate follows a single exponential (first order) time dependence. The rate of acylation is a function of [FA-phosphate] and [NAD+]. kacylation increases linearly with [NAD+] in the concentration range in which 0.5 to 2.0 moles of NAD+ are bound per mole of enzyme (mol wt 140,000), and extrapolates to zero, at zero NAD+ concentration. In the presence of a large excess of acyl phosphate, only 2 eq of acyl group can be introduced per mole of glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase, although this enzyme is known to be made up of four subunits of identical primary structure. At very high [FA-phosphate] and low [NAD+], the stoichiometry can be raised to as high as 3.5 eq of acyl per mole of enzyme; the first 2 acyl equivalents are introduced about 20 times more rapidly than subsequent acyl groups. Stoichiometric considerations and the influence of [NAD+] on kacylation strongly suggest that the four subunits (α) of the glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase molecule are arranged as two pairs (interacting pairs) (α2α'2) rather than as a symmetrical tetramer (α4). The affinity of the enzyme for NAD+ decreases on acylation. Increasing [NAD+] shifts the equilibrium, FA-phosphate + E ⇋ FA-enzyme + Pi, toward deacylation with a greater than first power dependence of Keq on [NAD+]. The rates of deacylation reactions of FA-enzyme (in the presence of an excess of arsenate, phosphate, or NADH) are more complex than would be anticipated on the basis of the above presumed acylation equilibrium. The results are discussed in terms of enzyme conformational changes, brought about both by acylation and by interaction with specific ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1607179755,"Abstract An unknown mitochondrial lipid which is labeled in vitro by incubation with γ-32P-adenosine triphosphate has been isolated. A series of degradations including hydrolysis, oxidation, and reduction of the 32P-lipid resulted in various labeled products which were then characterized by co-chromatography or by co-electrophoresis. Alkaline methanolysis resulted in the release of all radioactivity from the lipid as inorganic phosphate. On the basis of its chemical properties in comparison with synthetic palmitoyldihydroxyacetone phosphate, the lipid has been identified as an acyl dihydroxyacetone phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1558515036,"Abstract Rapidly labeled lipids of guinea pig liver mitochondria incubated with 32Pi or γ-32P-ATP were studied. With the use of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, it was shown that 32Pi is converted to labeled ATP, which is the more direct precursor of labeled lipid. Atractyloside blocks phosphorylation of lipid by endogenous ATP under conditions in which it has little effect on oxidative phosphorylation or lipid labeling by externally added ATP. Two radioactive lipids were identified by chromatography as phosphatidylinositol phosphate and phosphatidic acid. The properties of an unknown third lipid were studied. Its formation was selectively blocked by the addition of hydroxylamine to the incubation medium. It is postulated that the lipids are labeled by the action of kinases and phosphatases in the mitochondrial fraction."

https://openalex.org/W2040137259,The first flight response of bark beetles to synthetic sex pheromones under natural conditions is reported. Two insect species predaceous on this bark beetle also responded. The synthetic compounds delivered in an airstream from a substrate of Carbowax 20M on Chromosorb A appear to elicit the same response as the natural attractant from male-infested bolts of ponderosa pine elicits.
https://openalex.org/W2079574306,"An infectious agent obtained from patients who became ill after exposure to tissues of African green monkeys is viral in character. By electron microscopy, the agent appeared cylindrical, 90 to 100 nanometers in diameter, and 130 to 2600 nanometers in length. Cross-striations at 5-nanometer intervals and a core diameter of 45 nanometers were observed. The agent was completely resistant to the effects of the metabolic inhibitor 5-bromodeoxyuridine, which may mean that RNA is the genetic material. It was sensitive to ether and relatively sensitive to destruction by heat."
https://openalex.org/W2030430694,The excitatory postsynaptic potentials produced in motoneurons by impulses in single afferent fibers (Ia) have been recorded with the aid of an averaging computer. These responses were used to map the distribution of the terminals of single fibers within the pool of 300 motoneurons of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Twelve Ia fibers were studied in separate experiments. Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials were found in 94 percent of the 77 motoneurons investigated. This finding indicates that each of the 300 motoneurons must receive afferent fibers from almost all of the spindles of the muscle it innervates.
https://openalex.org/W1603928282,"The anaerobic incorporation of 32P into ATP by the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta was studied in the presence and absence of uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and anticestodal agents. Low concentrations of all compounds tested inhibited this incorporation. Under the anaerobic conditions employed, internal ATP concentrations remained constant in spite of the inhibition of the incorporation of exogenous 32P into ATP. On the other hand, removal of carbon dioxide, which is required by the helminths for optimal anaerobic carbohydrate utilization, produced a marked decrease in both 32P incorporation and ATP levels. These findings indicate the presence of an anaerobic phosphorylation site associated with electron transport. Mitochondrial preparations obtained from H. diminuta rapidly exchange 32P into ATP upon incubation in the absence of exogenous substrates. This exchange reaction is inhibited also by uncouplers and anticestodal agents. In addition, fumarate was reduced by NADH in aged or partially disrupted mitochondria of the worm, and no cytochrome oxidase activity was demonstrable."
https://openalex.org/W1604598779,"Nucleolar 4 to 6 S RNA of Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells was fractionated by exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-100. Three peaks of RNA were separated: I, a fraction that emerged in the void volume; II, a fraction emerging in the exclusion volume of 5 S RNA; and III, a 4 S RNA peak. Peak I, eluted in the void volume, contained approximately half the nucleolar 4 to 6 S RNA and had the highest incorporation of radioactivity among the three fractions 20 to 40 min after 32P-orthophosphate was injected into the ascites fluid. Each peak contained one major and one or more minor RNA bands of different mobility on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; the fastest moving bands were in the 4 S RNA fraction of Peak III, the slowest moving bands were in Peak I, and RNA bands of intermediate mobility were in Peak II. In addition, Peak I contained an RNA band which has not hitherto been described. Although the template activity of the RNA in each of the peaks was low, that of Peak I was the highest of the three fractions. The RNA in Peak II, which corresponds to ribosomal 5 S RNA in electrophoretic mobility and elution from Sephadex, had a higher content of uridylic acid (28.8%) and a lower content of cytidylic acid than ribosomal 5 S RNA. Virtually all of the amino acid acceptor activity was found in the 4 S RNA of Peak III. The presence of RNA other than amino acid acceptor RNA in Peak III is indicated by the base composition of the RNA, the low level of amino acid acceptor activity, and the low level of incorporation of 14C-methylmethionine. These studies indicate that nucleolar 4 to 6 S RNA contains components that are different from those of the cytoplasmic soluble 4 S RNA or the ribosomal 5 S RNA as indicated by base composition, template activity, and amino acid acceptor activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533366558,"1. The addition of a chelating agent was necessary in order to obtain maximal activity of rabbit liver fructose 1,6-diphosphatase at neutral pH. All attempts to demonstrate that this 10-fold or greater activation was merely due to the removal of trace heavy metal contaminants have been negative. 2. A naturally occurring material has been found in rabbit liver supernatant which produces a similar increase in enzymatic activity. Properties of the activator may be summarized as follows: (a) it is nondialyzable and destroyed by crystalline Bacillus subtilis proteolytic enzyme, and therefore it is probably a protein; (b) it can be precipitated at pH 6 and redissolved at pH 7.8; (c) it is unaffected by either p-mercuribenzoate or N-ethylmaleimide; (d) it is readily converted to aggregates upon purification. A very high concentration of activator was found in extracts of Novikoff hepatoma. 3. Purification of the muscle activator of liver fructose 1,6-diphosphatase paralleled phosphofructokinase activity. Twice recrystallized rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase activated rabbit liver fructose 1,6-diphosphatase 4-fold and both prevented and reversed the specific inhibition of the enzyme by adenosine 5′-monophosphate. Both phenomena were very specific for phosphofructokinase. The reversal of inhibition appears to be due to protein-protein interaction. Addition of adenosine 5′-triphosphate to this system counteracted the inhibition reversal. Similar results have been found with rabbit muscle fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. 4. Dissociation of muscle phosphofructokinase into active subunits of molecular weights 235,000 and 125,000 has been observed upon sucrose density gradient centrifugation in the presence of sulfate ions and liver supernatant (pH 6). It is suggested that these may be the active dimer and monomer, respectively, of phosphofructokinase. 5. The molecular and physiological significance of these observations is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2160990215,"Abstract The rate of hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate and the binding of inorganic pyrophosphate to myosin vary inversely with increasing concentration of free Mg++, in the presence of a magnesium ethylenediaminetetraacetate buffer system; half-maximum binding of pyrophosphate and 50% inhibition of adenosine triphosphatase activity occur at a free Mg++ concentration about 10-7 m at 3°. The binding of pyrophosphate to myosin is reduced if Ca++ replaces Mg++ in the medium; it is also reduced by lowering the pH or raising the temperature. Actin is a competitive inhibitor of pyrophosphate binding to myosin. The actin-myosin interaction requires firmly bound Mg++. 2,4-Dinitrophenol has no effect on pyrophosphate binding to myosin. A hypothesis is presented, on the basis of the above data, which gives a simple explanation of the effects of Mg++, Ca++, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and actin on the adenosine triphosphatase activity of myosin."

https://openalex.org/W1675448339,"Abstract When purified rabbit skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase is activated by preliminary incubation with γ-32P-ATP in the presence of Mg++ ions, it incorporates covalently bound 32P. All of the 32P is bound as alkali-labile phosphate, presumably on seryl residues. Serine phosphate has been isolated after partial acid hydrolysis of the labeled enzyme. Skeletal muscle and other tissues contain a phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of activated phosphorylase kinase, and it has been shown that this reaction is accompanied by reversal of activation. The phosphatase, tentatively designated phosphorylase kinase phosphatase, has a different tissue distribution profile than the phosphatase which catalyzes dephosphorylation of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and casein. Phosphorylase kinase phosphatase is activated by metal ions and is inhibited by sodium fluoride. When the phosphatase acts on activated phosphorylase kinase, various phosphorylated sites appear to be attacked at different rates."
https://openalex.org/W1591172061,"Digestion of preparations of insoluble collagen of guinea pig skin with collagenase and trypsin led to the production of two distinct glycopeptide fractions. The lower molecular weight fraction was similar in amount and in composition to the single predominant glycopeptide fraction obtained by similar treatment of soluble collagen. The major component in this fraction had the same chemical and physical characteristics as the glycohexapeptide, Gly-Met-Hyl(-Gal-Glc)-Gly-His-Arg, which had been characterized previously in similar digests of soluble collagen. The second and higher molecular weight glycopeptide fraction (which contained no hydroxylysine) was found only in insoluble collagen. The major amino acids and carbohydrates present in this fraction were aspartic and glutamic acids, glycine, alanine, serine, proline, glucose, galactose, mannose, glucosamine, galactosamine, and sialic acid. The fraction appeared to be quite heterogeneous, and it has not yet been possible to establish whether interpeptide crosslinks were present. This fraction was, however, increased in samples of perchlorate-insoluble collagen identical with those in which Hormann reported evidence for covalent cross-links involving carbohydrate. Alkaline hydrolysis of soluble or insoluble collagen led to the isolation of closely similar quantities of both O-Hyl-(-Gal-Glc) and O-Hyl(-Gal), thus establishing the presence of limited numbers of monosaccharide side chains in both forms of collagen. These analyses, as well as studies of partial acid hydrolysates of purified hydroxylysine-containing glycopeptides, showed the presence in mammalian skin collagen of a disaccharide in which C-1 of D-glucose is linked to D-galactose, and C-1 of D-galactose to the δ-hydroxyl group of hydroxylysine. No evidence was found for the participation of this carbohydrate prosthetic group in crosslinking related to the conversion of soluble collagen to insoluble collagen."

https://openalex.org/W1550704204,"Abstract The absorption spectrum of crystalline phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase had a peak at 276 mµ and a broad shoulder at 320 to 340 mµ. When activated in the region of 285 mµ the enzyme had a fluorescence emission spectrum with peaks in the region of 330 and 430 mµ. The 430 mµ peak was bleached when hydroxypyruvate phosphate was added. This result, plus the fluorescence activation spectrum, shows that the 430 mµ peak results from enzyme-bound DPNH. Addition of a solution of DPNH to the enzyme enhanced the 430 mµ peak and quenched the protein fluorescence at 330 mµ. The physiologically important inhibitor serine reduced the intensity of the 430 mµ peak. On the basis of changes in the fluorescence of the enzyme that accompany ligand binding, titrations were carried out with hydroxypyruvate phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, DPN, DPNH, analogues of DPNH, and serine. Dissociation constants were obtained and two binding sites per enzyme molecule were shown for hydroxypyruvate phosphate, DPNH, and serine. The titration curve for serine was sigmoidal, indicating interaction between the binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1593963480,"The effects of fasting on hydrolytic and synthetic activities of liver microsomal glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) have been investigated. Differential responses of the two types of activity were observed. Glucose 6-phosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate phosphohydrolase activity levels were elevated after a 48-hour fast, while inorganic pyrophosphate-glucose phosphotransferase activity responded relatively slightly, based on assays carried out in the absence of detergent. However, when homogenates were treated with deoxycholate prior to assay, parallel increases in all three activities were obtained. This latter observation constitutes additional substantiation for the multifunctional nature of microsomal glucose 6-phosphatase. The differential response patterns, and modifying effects of detergent thereon, were observed regardless of the hydrogen ion concentration in assay mixtures in the pH range 4.5 to 7. Kinetic analyses revealed that the differential response patterns were not due simply to fasting-induced changes in Km values, for the noted differences persisted when activity levels were expressed on the basis of Vmax values extrapolated to infinite concentrations of all substrates. Phosphotransferase activity of enzyme newly synthesized or newly activated in response to fasting appears to be blocked at the level of phosphoryl transfer from phosphoryl-enzyme intermediate to glucose. The observed differential patterns of response are consistent with the established hydrolytic role for the enzyme in fasted animals, and contrast with previously observed modes of response of these activities to glucocorticoid administration and experimental diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1604934061,"Abstract Solvent perturbation experiments were extended to the study of the location of tyrosyl groups in pancreatic ribonuclease. Together with the results obtained on the ureadenatured enzyme with a number of perturbants of varying dimensions and range effects, the results obtained were examined in terms of two alternative models. In Model A, three of the six tyrosyl residues were assumed to be buried, one partly blocked to solvent access, and two fully exposed. In Model B, two groups were taken to be buried, two partly blocked, and the remaining two exposed. The fraction of exposed groups predicted by Model B is found to agree closely with the experimental data. This model is also favored by the more recent iodination and denaturation solution studies of other workers and by the recently reported detailed three-dimensional x-ray structure of ribonuclease in the crystalline state. Solvent perturbation experiments on the urea-denatured protein suggest that in the native protein at least one of the normally titrating and presumably iodinating tyrosyl residues is partly blocked by an adjoining disulfide linkage. Experiments on the effects of divalent ions on the enzyme that has been unfolded in acid and urea show that the exposed tyrosyl residues in these media can be largely refolded and buried as a result of strong anion binding."
https://openalex.org/W1498534129,"Abstract These studies were initiated to ascertain whether, in rat brown adipose tissue as in white, lipolysis is a forerunner and fatty acid esterification an energy-consuming accompaniment of the increased oxygen uptake induced by catecholamines. No evidence could be obtained with brown adipose tissue slices to support this premise. Respiratory processes in homogenates of brown adipose tissue were therefore investigated. Oxygen consumption of homogenates of this tissue is increased about 25-fold upon the addition of a mixture of cofactors (coenzyme A, dl-carnitine, fumarate, and ATP). The addition of any single cofactor is without effect. The respiratory quotient of the process is less than 0.7. The stimulation of O2 consumption by cofactors is accompanied by a nearly 90-fold increase in the yield of radioactive CO2 from added trace amounts of palmitate-1-14C. Esterification of the added palmitate to triglyceride occurs only when glycerophosphate is present in addition to cofactors. Addition of glycerophosphate without cofactors results in a 10-fold stimulation of oxygen consumption but has little effect on the conversion of added palmitate-1-14C either to 14CO2 or to triglycerides. It is concluded that, in the absence of glycerophosphate, addition of cofactors stimulates the oxidation of fatty acids present in the homogenate but not their esterification to triglyceride. Glycerophosphate oxidation is accompanied by the production of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and fructose 1,6-diphosphate in amounts which account for the oxygen consumption observed. The oxidation of glycerophosphate is nearly completely inhibited by sodium cyanide and antimycin A, but is unaffected by the addition of sodium amytal, rotenone, or DPN. These results are interpreted to mean that oxidation of glycerophosphate is proceeding through the action of a DPN-independent glycerophosphate dehydrogenase. The addition of serum albumin (0.5%) to homogenates strongly inhibits the cofactor-stimulated O2 consumption, but has no effect on the oxidation of glycerophosphate. The results are discussed in relation to the production of high energy phosphate by brown adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1500467667,"Abstract Neurospora crassa lysine auxotrophs 33933 and STL-7 which on nutritional grounds are known to be blocked at an early stage of lysine biosynthesis via the aminoadipic acid pathway, were found to accumulate homocitrate and malate plus citrate, respectively. Such accumulations predominate only when these mutants are grown in a medium containing minimal, but not excess, lysine. The acids were isolated by two-phase partition chromatography on silicic acid, and their structures were adduced from appropriate chemical and spectral data. Homocitrate was formed from acetate and α-ketoglutarate under suitable conditions by cell-free extracts of mutant 33933, but such homocitrate-condensing enzyme activity could not be shown in mutant STL-7 under the conditions of assay. Homocitrate-condensing enzyme activity of mutant 33933 extracts was subject to repression and feedback inhibition by lysine. The significance, if any, of malate and citrate accumulation to lysine metabolism in mutant STL-7 remains to be elucidated. This paper extends present knowledge, derived exclusively from studies in yeast, and shows that, in Neurospora, the initial step of lysine biosynthesis is via a homocitrate-condensing enzyme which is under effective end product control by lysine."

https://openalex.org/W1607237977,"Abstract A molecular weight of 163,000 daltons was determined by equilibrium sedimentation analysis for crystalline 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase. The enzymatically active enzyme had a s20, w of 7.7 and treatment at alkaline pH values or with silver ions inactivated the enzyme and reduced the s20, w to 3.0. The decrease in sedimentation coefficient indicated dissociation of the enzyme and sedimentation equilibrium measurements made in 3.75 m guanidine-HCl showed that the enzyme was composed of subunits with a molecular weight between 40 and 50,000 daltons. The amino acid composition of the enzyme was determined. A p-hydroxymercuribenzoate titration showed approximately 12 readily available sulfhydryl groups and the fluorometric determination of DPN showed that the enzyme crystallized with 2 moles of DPNH bound per mole of enzyme. The intensity of the peak at 330 and 430 mµ in the fluorescence emission spectrum was altered in a characteristic way by changes in pH. Changes in the fluorescence spectrum were also observed when the enzyme was treated with silver ions or p-hydroxymercuribenzoate."
https://openalex.org/W1529351854,"The initial rates of incorporation of amino acids by liver microsomes and ribosomes (prepared without detergent and with polyuridylic acid in place of endogenous messenger RNA) from normal, partially hepatectomized, and acutely stressed (Celite-treated) rats are linear. Removal of part of the liver and stress cause increases in the initial rates of incorporation. The reactivities of liver microsomes and ribosomes with puromycin are also enhanced by partial hepatectomy and acute stress. The enhanced rates of reaction with the antibiotic were observed in the presence and absence of guanosine triphosphate and over a wide range of Mg++ concentrations. The changes in reactivity with puromycin parallel the changes in vitro and in vivo in liver protein synthesis as a function of time after partial hepatectomy and acute stress. When normal liver microsomes are treated with 1% deoxycholate, the initial rates of incorporation of 14C-leucine and 3H-puromycin are raised to the levels ordinarily found with untreated preparations from partially hepatectomized and stressed animals. The initial rates with preparations from partially hepatectomized and stressed animals are not affected by the detergent. Similar results are obtained when ribosomes have been treated with deoxycholate. These results suggest that liver ribosomes contain a factor that regulates peptide bond synthesis or the attachment of aminoacyl transfer RNA. Removal of part of the liver and acute stress may reduce the function of the regulatory factor, and deoxycholate may remove it from the ribosome."

https://openalex.org/W1530961414,"Abstract Wurster's blue, a semiquindiimine radical of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, acts as an artificial electron carrier in the oxidation of substrates by the respiratory chain. The effect of this compound on the oxidation of various substrates has been studied at three levels of organization: submitochondrial particles, mitochondria, and intact tissue culture cells. In cardiac submitochondrial particles (the Keilin-Hartree preparation), as judged by the rate of oxygen consumption, the inhibition of NADH and succinate oxidation by various respiratory inhibitors was bypassed through Wurster's blue. The typical inhibitors were antimycin A, hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, triflurothenoylacetone, rotenone, Amytal, and Seconal. In liver mitochondria, studied at States 3 and 4, the observation was the same whether β-hydroxybutyrate or succinate was used as a substrate. The phosphorylation was partially restored by Wurster's blue in the inhibited systems of mitochondria. The P:O ratios of about 1 and 2 resulted for oxidation of succinate-Wurster's blue and β-hydroxybutyrate-Wurster's blue, respectively, when antimycin A was present. However, the P:O ratio was 1 in the presence of rotenone, Amytal, Seconal, or antimycin A plus Seconal for the β-hydroxybutyrate-Wurster's blue system. In systems of tissue culture cells, the inhibition of endogenous respiration was reversed by Wurster's blue. Cellular ATP content decreased considerably in the presence of Wurster's blue, but never reached zero. The viability of cells was practically not affected by Wurster's blue during a 4-hour incubation. The oxidation-reduction states of cytochromes were followed with respect to the interaction of substrates plus Wurster's blue with the respiratory chain in the presence and absence of various inhibitors. An energy-dependent reduction of cytochrome b via the reversed electron transport utilizing the reducing equivalents from Wurster's blue-substrate systems was shown. The results of the experiments on respiration and phosphorylation together with spectrophotometric evidence indicate the general nature of Wurster's blue shunts in the respiratory chain.

Its properties suggest that it is B12 5'-phosphate. The new compound is converted, presumably by a phosphatase, to B12. Mild heating of the bacteria appears to inactivate the phosphatase, and increases the yield of the precursor. A biosynthetic route is proposed, involving condensation of guanosine diphosphate cobinamide with α-ribazole 5'-phosphate. Two new compounds, α-ribazole 3',5'-diphosphate and a corrinoid containing a total of three phosphate groups, have been obtained by chemical synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2041561822,"Human fibroblasts infected in vitro with cytomegalovirus are relatively resistant to infection by Toxoplasma gondii during the first 4 days of virus infection. After 5 days, however, the cytomegalovirus-infected cells become susceptible to the parasites. The toxoplasmas replicate in paracentral rosettes surrounded by host cell mitochondria. This growth configuration differs from that seen in human fibroblasts infected in vitro with toxoplasma only but resembles the pattern seen in doubly infected cells found in human necropsy tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1546792481,"Abstract The enzyme citraconase (citramalate hydro-lyase, citraconate hydratase, EC 4.2.1) which catalyses the hydration of citraconate to levorotatory citramalate has been purified about 25-fold from an initial specific activity of 0.2 to a final specific activity of 5.0. The enzyme requires activation by a sulfhydryl compound (such as reduced glutathione, cysteine, thioglycollate, or mercaptoethanol) and ferrous ions for maximal activity; ascorbate has no activating effect. The activation is carried out by preincubation of the enzyme and cofactors anaerobically at room temperature. Only ferrous ions, among the metallic ions tested, activate citraconase in conjunction with glutathione. Cupric and mercuric ions inhibit the enzyme activity under similar conditions to the extent of about 80%. The optimum pH for citraconase activity is 7.5 and the activity falls off markedly on both sides of the optimum. The partially purified citraconase preparation does not act on other substrates such as mesaconate, maleate, fumarate, cis- and trans-aconitate. It does not contain any other related enzymic activity except very low isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. The Km for citraconate at pH 7.5 and 30° is 1.1 mm. Metal-complexing agents (1 mm) such as pyrophosphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, o-phenanthroline, 8-hydroxyquinoline and α,α'-bipyridyl have a pronounced (99%) inhibitory effect on the enzyme (in the absence of reduced glutathione). In the presence of 0.5 mm reduced glutathione the inhibition by these agents is of the order of 74% (indicating that glutathione perhaps supplies Fe++). Sulfhydryl reagents such as iodoacetate and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate markedly inhibit citraconase activity (98%)."

https://openalex.org/W1612500014,"Abstract Microsomal particulate fractions of rat organ homogenates are capable of catalyzing the synthesis of glycerol 1-phosphate1 from inorganic pyrophosphate and glycerol. The product has been isolated and characterized by elementary analysis, specific rotation, and chemical and enzymatic studies. PPi-glycerol phosphotransferase is presumably specific for the primary carbinol group of glycerol opposite to that which is phosphorylated by ATP-glycerol phosphotransferase (glycerol kinase). The distribution and some of the kinetic properties of PPi-glycerol phosphotransferase have been studied and compared with those of PPi-glucose phosphotransferase, which catalyzes the synthesis of glucose 6-phosphate. The two activities are roughly parallel in liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa, and glucose is a competitive inhibitor of the synthesis of glycerol 1-phosphate by these organ preparations. Spleen, brain, and lung preparations catalyze the phosphorylation of glycerol from PPi while they are completely incapable of glucose 6-phosphate synthesis. In these organs glucose does not inhibit the synthesis of glycerol 1-phosphate. This suggests that there are at least two transferase enzymes which phosphorylate glycerol, one of which may be the same as the liver PPi-glucose phosphotransferase that is probably identical with glucose 6-phosphatase. Liver PPi-glycerol phosphotransferase has a pH optimum of about 5.0, is activated by preliminary treatment with deoxycholate or by NH4OH at pH 9.5, has no requirement for Mg++ or other added cofactor, and has a Km for PPi of 5 x 10-3 and for glycerol of about 3 m. The rate of hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate, which proceeds simultaneously with synthetic transferase activity, is inhibited by glucose and accelerated by glycerol. This phenonemon is observed also when studied as a function of pH or of PPi, glucose, or glycerol concentration. Cytidine triphosphate or glucose-6-P can replace PPi as an efficient donor, while ATP is relatively inactive in the synthesis of glycerol 1-phosphate by the liver microsomal enzyme. Glycerol 1-phosphate is hydrolyzed at a much faster rate than is glycerol 3-phosphate by the liver microsomal preparations. This enzymatic synthesis provides a convenient method for the preparation of glycerol 1-phosphate (D-α-glycerophosphate)."

https://openalex.org/W1596889349,"Abstract The control of glycogenolysis in the urinary bladder of the toad (Bufo marinus) in vitro has been examined by measuring the concentration of glycogenolytic intermediates and cofactors in the tissue. When the rate of glycogenolysis was increased by anaerobiosis, metabolite levels indicated activation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. The activation of phosphofructokinase was probably secondary to a fall in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate and a rise in the concentration of adenosine mono- and diphosphate and inorganic phosphate. Activation of pyruvate kinase may have been secondary to a fall in the concentration of adenosine triphosphate and a rise in adenosine diphosphate or the rise in the concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate or both. Incubation with arginine vasotocin in a Ringer's solution containing sodium stimulated glycogenolysis under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. The hormone caused activation of phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase without marked changes in the concentration of cofactors. Since arginine vasotocin affects the toad bladder by stimulating adenyl cyclase activity, it is speculated that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate activates phosphorylase, resulting in a rise in the concentration of fructose 6-phosphate, which in turn activates phosphofructokinase, resulting in a rise in the concentration of fructose, 1,6-diphosphate, which may activate pyruvate kinase. When sodium transport was inhibited by incubating the bladder with ouabain or in a Ringer's solution in which tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane ions replaced all of the sodium ions, the rate of glycogenolysis fell as a result of inhibition at phosphofructokinase. There were no significant changes in the concentration of adenosine mono-, di-, or triphosphate or inorganic phosphate. In contrast to experiments in a Na+ Ringer's solution, arginine vasotocin did not stimulate glycogenolysis in bladders incubated in a Tris+ Ringer's solution. Metabolite levels indicated only slight activation of phosphorylase and no activation of phosphofructokinase or pyruvate kinase. Again, no change in the concentration of cofactors was detected. It is concluded that phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase are glycogenolytic control points in the toad bladder responding to changes in the concentration of cofactors In addition, it is apparent that the rate of sodium transport affects the activity of these enzymes through an unknown pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1574501506,"Abstract Randomly labeled erythritol-14C has been synthesized and incubated with fluoride-poisoned suspensions of dried cells of Propionibacterium pentosaceum. Therefrom labeled glycerol-3-P, glyceric acid-3-P, erythritol-1-P, ribose-5-P, xylulose-5-P, glucose-6-P, fructose-6-P, mannose-6-P, fructose-1,6-di-P, and sedoheptulose-7-P were isolated. Erythritol-14C-1-P accumulated more rapidly than did the other phosphates. Even under conditions in which its dephosphorylation is inhibited it was metabolized to the same products as was erythritol-14C. Also, in short term experiments the addition of unlabeled l-erythritol-1-P to cell preparations actively metabolizing erythritol-14C reduced the amount of label normally found as glyceric acid-3-P. This supports the view that in P. pentosaceum erythritol metabolism proceeds via a series of phosphorylated intermediates, of which l-erythritol-1-P is the primary member. l-Erythritol-1-P can serve as hydrogen donor for the reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol in cell-free extracts. Although the product of the oxidation was not isolated, indirect evidence suggests that it is l-erythrulose-1-P and that this compound is the next intermediate in the erythritol fermentation. Labeling dilution experiments indicated that d-erythrose-4-P is not a direct intermediate in the sequence. The formation of labeled formaldehyde in the reaction mixtures lends support to the view that l-erythrulose-1-P, formed from l-erythritol-1-P, undergoes cleavage between the C3 and C4 positions to yield formaldehyde and dihydroxyacetone-P. This cleavage, combined with reactions known to occur in the propionic acid bacteria, provides a source of the labeled C3, C5, C6, and C7 sugar phosphates accumulating in the cell suspensions and an explanation for the substantial quantities of formic acid produced in the fermentation of erythritol."

In spinal cats ventilated with oxygen, we stimulated a dorsal spinal root and recorded the compound ventral root potential. The reflex potential was not affected by 6.25 milligrams of gallamine per kilogram. Giving 12.5 milligrams of gallamine per kilogram had no significant effect on the monosynaptic spike height, but the polysynaptic response rose briefly to 12 percent above control. Increased magnitude of the polysynaptic response appeared related to a concomitant rise in blood pressure."

https://openalex.org/W1583260067,"Abstract Under conditions for the optimum activities of l-α-glycerophosphate and lactate dehydrogenases, cysteine reacts with dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate. The thiohemiketals presumably formed are not substrates for the enzymes. By competing with the enzymes for the substrate, the reaction of cysteine with dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate inhibits their enzymatic reductions to α-glycerophosphate and lactate; the reverse reactions are promoted through removal of the products of the enzymatic reactions. The reaction between cysteine and certain carbonyl compounds may be responsible for several unexplained results in enzymatic systems where both α-keto acid and cysteine, or homocysteine, are the substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1997990430,"IN 1953, Andrewes et al.1 reported the propagation of a virus in cultures of primary human embryonic lung from nasal washings of a patient (D. C.) with a common cold. Although no cytopathic effects were noted, culture fluids from the fourth to the tenth passage produced colds in volunteers whereas control fluids did not. At that time, attempts to repeat these experiments were unsuccessful. Using nasal washings from individuals inoculated with D. C. material, Tyrrell et al.2 attempted to propagate the D.C. virus in primary human embryo kidney cultures in conditions favourable for recovery of rhino viruses. Although these tests were also unsuccessful, these workers were able to propagate a virus, with production of cytopathic effects, in human diploid fibroblast cultures. This development led to the recognition of the agent as a rhinovirus. It is probable but not certain that this virus is the same as that which was in the original D. C. nasal washings."
