https://openalex.org/W2891599654,"Transistor sensing in salt solutions Molecular binding to receptors on the surface of field-effect transistors (FETs) can be sensed through changes in transconductance. However, the saline solutions typically used with biomolecules create an electrical double layer that masks any events that occur within about 1 nanometer from the surface. Nakatsuka et al. overcame this limitation by using binding to large, negatively charged DNA stem loop structures that, upon ligand binding, cause conformational changes that can be sensed with an FET, even in solutions with high ionic strength. The authors demonstrate the sensing of charged molecules such as dopamine in artificial cerebrospinal fluid as well as neutral molecules such as glucose and zwitterion molecules like sphingosine-1-phosphate.

The brain generates new neurons throughout life in the hippocampus, a process called adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). Choi et al. found that blocking AHN exacerbated cognitive impairment in an AD mouse model (see the Perspective by Spires-Jones and Ritchie). Inducing neurogenesis alone did not improve cognition in AD mice, whereas inducing neurogenesis while simultaneously ameliorating the neuronal environment via exercise did. The use of genetic or pharmacological treatments that simultaneously induced neurogenesis and increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mimicked the benefits of exercise on cognition. Thus, inducing both neurogenesis and providing BDNF may be useful as an AD therapeutic. Science , this issue p. eaan8821 ; see also p. 975"

It is clear that small hydrocarbon fragments formed in flames must aggregate into larger particles, but the initial driving force for aggregation remains a mystery. Johansson et al. combined theory and mass spectrometry to suggest a solution based on resonance-stabilized radicals (see the Perspective by Thomson and Mitra). Aromatics such as cyclopentadiene have a characteristically weak C–H bond because their cleavage produces radicals with extended spans of π-electron conjugation. Clusters thus build up through successive coupling reactions that extend conjugation in stabilized radicals of larger and larger size. Science , this issue p. 997 ; see also p. 978"

This difference is regulated by opening or closing ion channels in the cell membrane. For example, mutations in human voltage-gated sodium (Na v ) channels are associated with disorders such as chronic pain, epilepsy, and cardiac arrhythmia. Pan et al. report the high-resolution structure of a human Na v channel, and Shen et al. report the structures of an insect Na v channel bound to the toxins that cause pufferfish and shellfish poisoning in humans. Together, the structures give insight into the molecular basis of sodium ion permeation and provide a path toward structure-based drug discovery. Science , this issue p. eaau2486 , p. eaau2596"

For crops, this translates into lower yield when plant immunity is activated. Wang et al. show that, in rice, reversible phosphorylation of a key transcription factor allows the plant to defend against fungal attack when needed but then, within days, reallocate resources back to growth (see the Perspective by Greene and Dong). Thus, both pathogen defense and crop yield can be sustained. Science , this issue p. 1026 ; see also p. 976"
https://openalex.org/W2890683593,"Metastatic drivers same as primary Treatment decisions for cancer patients are increasingly guided by analysis of the gene mutations that drive primary tumor growth. Relatively little is known about driver gene mutations in metastases, which cause most cancer-related deaths. Reiter et al. explored whether the growth of different metastatic lesions within an individual patient is fueled by the same or distinct gene mutations. In a study of 76 untreated metastases from 20 patients with different types of cancer, all metastases within a patient shared the same functional driver gene mutations. Thus, analysis of a single biopsy could help oncologists select the optimal therapy for patients with widespread metastatic disease. Science , this issue p. 1033"

For example, phages use anti-CRISPR proteins to inhibit the bacterial type I and II CRISPR systems (see the Perspective by Koonin and Makarova). Watters et al. and Marino et al. used bioinformatic and experimental approaches to identify inhibitors of type V CRISPR-Cas12a. Cas12a has been successfully engineered for gene editing and nucleic acid detection. Some of the anti-Cas12a proteins identified in these studies had broad-spectrum inhibitory effects on Cas12a orthologs and could block Cas12a-mediated genome editing in human cells.

Although bacteria harboring CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas3 adaptive immune systems sometimes acquire mobile genetic elements encoding anti-CRISPR proteins that inhibit Cas9, Cas3, or the DNA-binding Cascade complex, no such inhibitors have been found for CRISPR-Cas12a. Here we use a comprehensive bioinformatic and experimental screening approach to identify three different inhibitors that block or diminish CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated genome editing in human cells. We also find a widespread connection between CRISPR self-targeting and inhibitor prevalence in prokaryotic genomes, suggesting a straightforward path to the discovery of many more anti-CRISPRs from the microbial world."

But is this its only benefit? Li et al. conducted experiments using a climate model to show that the installation of large-scale wind and solar power generation facilities in the Sahara could cause more local rainfall, particularly in the neighboring Sahel region. This effect, caused by a combination of increased surface drag and reduced albedo, could increase coverage by vegetation, creating a positive feedback that would further increase rainfall.

https://openalex.org/W2809542713,"Fertilization is fundamental for sexual reproduction, yet its molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that an oocyte-expressed Ly6/uPAR protein, which we call Bouncer, is a crucial fertilization factor in zebrafish. Membrane-bound Bouncer mediates sperm-egg binding and is thus essential for sperm entry into the egg. Remarkably, Bouncer not only is required for sperm-egg interaction but is also sufficient to allow cross-species fertilization between zebrafish and medaka, two fish species that diverged more than 200 million years ago. Our study thus identifies Bouncer as a key determinant of species-specific fertilization in fish. Bouncer's closest homolog in tetrapods, SPACA4, is restricted to the male germline in internally fertilizing vertebrates, which suggests that our findings in fish have relevance to human biology."
https://openalex.org/W2890393634,"Immune therapy of cancer is among the most promising recent advances in medicine. Whether the immune system can keep cancer in check depends on, among other factors, the efficiency of immune cells to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. We describe a time-resolved single-cell assay that reports the quality, quantity, and kinetics of target cell death induced by single primary human natural killer (NK) cells. The assay reveals that single NK cells induce cancer cell death by apoptosis and necrosis but also by mixed forms. Inhibition of either one of the two major cytotoxic pathways, perforin/granzyme release or FasL/FasR interaction, unmasked the parallel activity of the other one. Ca2+ influx through Orai channels is important for tuning killer cell function. We found that the apoptosis/necrosis ratio of cancer cell death by NK cells is controlled by the magnitude of Ca2+ entry and furthermore by the relative concentrations of perforin and granzyme B. The possibility to change the apoptosis/necrosis ratio employed by NK cells offers an intriguing possibility to modulate the immunogenicity of the tumor microenvironment.

https://openalex.org/W2892081615,"Galaxies grow inefficiently, with only a few percent of the available gas converted into stars each free-fall time. Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, one billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 km/s relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of two of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift."
https://openalex.org/W2891325408,"Fatty acid channeling into oxidation or storage modes depends on physiological conditions and hormonal signaling. However, the directionality of this channeling may also depend on the association of each of the five acyl-CoA synthetase isoforms with specific protein partners. Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs) catalyze the conversion of long-chain fatty acids to fatty acyl-CoAs, which are then either oxidized or used in esterification reactions. In highly oxidative tissues, ACSL1 is located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and directs fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. In the liver, however, about 50% of ACSL1 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where its metabolic function is unclear. Because hepatic fatty acid partitioning is likely to require the interaction of ACSL1 with other specific proteins, we used an unbiased protein interaction technique, BioID, to discover ACSL1-binding partners in hepatocytes. We targeted ACSL1 either to the ER or to the OMM of Hepa 1–6 cells as a fusion protein with the Escherichia coli biotin ligase, BirA*. Proteomic analysis identified 98 proteins that specifically interacted with ACSL1 at the ER, 55 at the OMM, and 43 common to both subcellular locations. We found subsets of peroxisomal and lipid droplet proteins, tethering proteins, and vesicle proteins, uncovering a dynamic role for ACSL1 in organelle and lipid droplet interactions. Proteins involved in lipid metabolism were also identified, including acyl-CoA–binding proteins and ceramide synthase isoforms 2 and 5. Our results provide fundamental and detailed insights into protein interaction networks that control fatty acid metabolism.

Our results provide fundamental and detailed insights into protein interaction networks that control fatty acid metabolism. Major pathways for lipid synthesis and degradation are physically separated by their locations within distinct intracellular organelles, but evidence is growing that lipid intermediates destined for independent fates can also be channeled within a single compartment such as the cytosol. Despite their amphipathicity and water solubility, such channeling appears to occur for long-chain acyl-CoAs. In addition to physiological controls such as the AMP kinase-regulated production of malonyl-CoA, which regulates carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) activity and enhances β-oxidation, the fate of fatty acids (FA) 2The abbreviations used are: FAfatty acidACSLlong-chain acyl-CoA synthetaseOMMouter mitochondrial membraneERendoplasmic reticulumVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelRCFrelative centrifugal forceMAMmitochondria-associated membraneASMacid-soluble metaboliteDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumHRPhorseradish peroxidaseLFDlow-fat dietHFDhigh-fat dietaaamino acidEGFRepidermal growth factor receptoresiRNAendoribonuclease-prepared siRNALDlipid dropletRFPred fluorescent proteinqPCRquantitative PCRPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorTAGtriacylglycerolACSacyl-CoA synthetaseSDAD(NHS-SS-diazirine) (succinimidyl 2-((4,4′-azipentanamido)ethyl)-1,3′-dithiopropionate). seems also to be determined by their origin from an exogenous source or from their de novo intracellular synthesis. Activation by distinct members of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) family mediates FA fates. Thus, mice deficient in ACSL5, the major intestinal ACSL isoform, show delayed absorption of dietary triacylglycerol, increased energy expenditure, and decreased adipose tissue (1Bowman T.A.

In oxidative tissues, ACSL1 is primarily located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), consistent with its role in directing FA toward oxidation. In liver, however, ACSL1 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as well as the OMM, but the function of ACSL1 in either location is unclear, because the deficiency has a minimal effect on either β-oxidation or glycerolipid synthesis (8Li L.O.

Several factors may contribute to the ability of ACSL1 to direct FA toward synthetic pathways versus mitochondrial oxidation, including its subcellular location; ACSL1 is anchored to the ER or to the OMM by a single N-terminal transmembrane domain (9Lewin T.M. Kim J.H. Granger D.A. Vance J.E. Coleman R.A. Acyl-CoA synthetase isoforms 1, 4, and 5 are present in different subcellular membranes in rat liver and can be inhibited independently.J. Biol.

In addition, we showed that different physiological stimuli regulate ACSL1 post-translationally by altering phosphorylation and acetylation of specific amino acid residues, although the function of these modifications remains obscure (10Frahm J.L.

We have hypothesized that specific interactions of ACSL1 with networks of associated proteins might have a major influence on function. A proteomics analysis reported physical interactions between ACSL1, voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), and CPT-1 in liver OMM (11Lee K. Kerner J. Hoppel C.L.

However, our studies show that exogenous FA oxidation in liver is only partially impaired in the absence of ACSL1, suggesting that the association with CPT-1 might not provide a full explanation or that other ACSL isoforms might compensate for lack of ACSL1 (8Li L.O.

To capture weak or transient protein interactions at both subcellular locations, we expressed ER- or OMM-targeted ACSL1 as fusion proteins with BirA* in Hepa 1–6 cells and used primary mouse hepatocytes to validate the results for a number of specific proteins. Our results strongly support the idea that ACSL1 can channel FA into defined downstream pathways via a network of interacting proteins, and we show how physiological changes can transiently shape these interactions. Hepatic ACSL1 is expressed at the OMM, the ER, and at mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM), an ER region that is reversibly tethered to mitochondria and involved in calcium and phospholipid transport (Fig. 1A and supporting information 1) (15Vance J.E.

Because the N terminus is required for insertion into the membrane, we positioned the BirA* tag at the C terminus. ACSL1 expression was targeted to the ER using a chimera of FATP4 (aa 1–46) and ACSL1 (aa 47–699), denoted as ER–ACSL1–BirA*. To study interactions at the OMM, a TOM70 sequence (aa 1–69) was integrated into the N terminus of ACSL1 (aa 46–699), denoted as mito-ACSL1–BirA* (Fig. 1C). Organelle-targeted fluorescent protein controls were generated to eliminate nonspecific BirA* interactions (Fig. 1C) (16Zhan T. Poppelreuther M. Ehehalt R. Füllekrug J. Overexpressed FATP1, ACSVL4/FATP4 and ACSL1 increase the cellular fatty acid uptake of 3T3-L1 adipocytes but are localized on intracellular membranes.PLoS One. 2012; 7 (23024797): e4508710.1371/journal.pone.0045087Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subcellular location was validated using immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, D and E). When expressed with a C-terminal BirA* tag, ER- and OMM-directed ACSL1 retained enzymatic function with specific activities similar to wildtype (WT) ACSL1 (Fig. 2A). The expression of BirA*-tagged proteins in the presence of biotin increased the abundance of protein biotinylation with different patterns for each of the targeted constructs (Fig. 2, B and C). We used streptavidin affinity chromatography to purify biotin-labeled proteins, which were then identified by LC-MS/MS. To reduce false-positive selection, only proteins enriched ≥5-fold with a p < 0.05 in the ACSL1 datasets versus organelle-specific controls were selected as positive protein interactors. Statistical analysis comparing the interactome of ACSL1 at either the OMM or ER confirmed a direct interaction of 98 proteins unique to the ER–ACSL1–BirA* sample and 55 proteins exclusively in the mito-ACSL1–BirA* sample. Forty three proteins were common to both datasets (Fig. 2D).

The complete interactome of ACSL1 at both subcellular locations was subjected to STRING analysis, which revealed clusters of protein networks (Fig. 4, A and B). Surprisingly, we did not find interactions with the acyltransferases required for triacylglycerol (TAG) or cholesterol ester synthesis; instead, the proteins identified in the ER–ACSL1–BirA* dataset suggested that the cytosolic domain of ACSL1 participates in niche pathways involving ceramide synthesis and peroxisomal metabolism. A network of peroxisomal proteins was identified, most notably ABC subfamily D-3 (ABCD3), that may transport long chain acyl-CoAs into peroxisomes: ACBD5, which interacts with the ER proteins VAPA and VAPB (17Costello J.L.

As expected, the analysis identified a number of proteins that can bind lipids or are involved in lipid metabolism. These proteins included ceramide synthase isoform 2 (CerS2) and ceramide synthase isoform 5 (CerS5), which had previously been shown to interact with ACSL1 (19Senkal C.E. Salama M.F. Snider A.J.

Additionally identified in the ER–ACSL1–BirA* cohort were two acyl-CoA–binding domain-containing proteins, ACBD3 and ACBD5. ACBD3, also known as GCP60, is predominantly associated with the Golgi but can be found at the ER and mitochondria (20Fan J. Liu J. Culty M. Papadopoulos V.

ACBD5 is a peroxisomal acyl-CoA–binding protein that participates in ER–peroxisome tethering (17Costello J.L. Castro I.G. Hacker C. Schrader T.A. Metz J. Zeuschner D. Azadi A.S. Godinho L.F.

BirA*-tagged proteins are known to self-biotinylate; therefore, ACSL1 peptides present in both the ER and OMM datasets cannot be distinguished from endogenous ACSL1 protein.

STRING analysis identified noteworthy clusters of associated/interacting proteins in the mitochondria dataset, including ACSL3 and several SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins, including SNAP23 (synaptosomal-associated protein 23), VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein) 2, 4, and 5, and syntaxin 7 and 8 (Fig. 4B). SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion, suggesting a role for ACSL1 at membrane contact sites between mitochondria and other organelles or vesicles. Also of interest in the mito-ACSL1–BirA* dataset was a cluster of proteins surrounding EGFR. EGFR and GPRC5A are known to interact at the plasma membrane (25Zhong S. Yin H. Liao Y. Yao F. Li Q.

Eighteen percent of the proteins in our ER–ACSL1–BirA dataset, 20% of the proteins in our OMM–ACSL1 interactome, and 14% of the ACSL1-interacting proteins at both the ER and OMM were identified as lipid droplet proteins (supporting information S3).

Using diazirine photocross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation in mouse hepatocytes, we confirmed a direct interaction between ACSL1 and endogenously expressed ACBD5 and VAPB (Fig. 5, A and B). Because ACSL1 may be present at the ER–peroxisome interface to activate FA destined for peroxisomal metabolism, we investigated several ACSL1-interacting proteins that are required for peroxisomal metabolism of branched-chain FA. Phytol, the most prominent dietary branched-chain FA, is first converted to phytenal and oxidized by ALDH3A2 (FALDH) to generate phytenic/phytanic acid, which is then activated to an acyl-CoA that is oxidized in peroxisomes. Both ACSL1 and ACSVL1 can activate branched-chain FA (29Watkins P.A. Howard A.E. Gould S.J. Avigan J. Mihalik S.J.

However, studies exploring interspecies relationships are very limited in Nepal, making it difficult for the government of Nepal and conservation partners to manage wildlife in their habitats, especially in Himalayan protected areas. In this study, we identified habitat overlap between Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) and red panda (Ailurus fulgens) as well as important habitat types for both species in the Makalu Barun National Park, Nepal using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling. GPS points of species occurrence were collected from the field, and environmental variables were extracted from freely available sources. We found that the study area contained 647 km2 of Asiatic black bear habitat and 443 km2 of the red panda habitat. 368 km2 supported both species, which constituted 57% of the Asiatic black bear habitat and 83% of the red panda habitat. We found that conifer forest was the most important habitat type for both species. Because the largest portions of both species’ habitat were located inside the buffer zone, a peripheral zone of national park, conservation efforts for these sympatric species should be focused inside the buffer zone to be most effective."

Mena et al. now describe a quality control pathway they term dimerization quality control (DQC) (see the Perspective by Herhaus and Dikic). DQC monitors and prevents aberrant dimerization of BTB domain–containing proteins. The system relies on FBXL17, an adaptor protein that recruits an E3 ligase that specifically ubiquitylates nonfunctional BTB heterodimers, triggering their degradation. FBXL17 accesses a degradation signal at the BTB dimer interface in nonphysiological, nonfunctional complexes. The loss of DQC from Xenopus laevis embryos leads to lethal neurodevelopmental defects.

We investigated this in a novel decision-making task in humans (n = 76) while measuring brain activity with fMRI (n = 24). Modeling revealed that participants computed the prospective value of decisions: they planned their future behavior taking into account how their decisions might affect which states they would encounter and how they themselves might respond in these states. They considered their own likely future behavioral biases (e.g., failure to adapt to changes in prospective value) and avoided situations in which they might be prone to such biases. Three neural networks in adjacent medial frontal regions were linked to distinct components of prospective decision making: activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, area 8 m/9, and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex reflected prospective value, anticipated changes in prospective value, and the degree to which prospective value influenced decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2889818019,"Loneliness is thought to serve as an adaptive signal indicating the need to repair or replace salutary social connections. Accordingly, loneliness may influence preferences for interpersonal distance. If loneliness simply motivates a desire to socially reconnect, then loneliness may be associated with a preference for smaller interpersonal distances. According to the evolutionary model of loneliness, however, loneliness also signals an inadequacy of mutual aid and protection, augmenting self-preservation motives. If loneliness both increases the motivation to reconnect and increases the motivation for self-protection, then the resulting approach-avoidance conflict should produce a preference for larger interpersonal distance, at least within intimate (i.e., proximal) space. Here, we report two survey-based studies of participants’ preferences for interpersonal distance to distinguish between these competing hypotheses. In Study 1 (N = 175), loneliness predicted preferences for larger interpersonal distance within intimate space net gender, objective social isolation, anxiety, depressive symptomatology, and marital status. In Study 2 (N = 405), we replicated these results, and mediation analyses indicated that measures of social closeness could not adequately explain our findings. These studies provide compelling evidence that loneliness predicts preferences for larger interpersonal distance within intimate space, consistent with predictions from the evolutionary model of loneliness."

https://openalex.org/W2889626642,"Introduction Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a spectrum of high risk behaviors including alcohol abuse and dependence. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is progressive loss of renal function for more or equal to 3 months or presence of any irreversible kidney damage. Common risk factors of CKD have been identified, but the impact of alcohol consumption on kidney function is controversial. The study aims to investigate the relationship between alcohol use disorder and CKD on a national scale. Methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance research database. Patients aged 20 years or older, without CKD and with the diagnosis of AUD (ICD-9-CM codes 303.X; 305.0, V113) from years 2000 to 2013 were enrolled. Control cohort was selected to match the demographics of the target population. Patients were followed until the end of 2013 or earlier if they developed CKD, died, or lost follow up. Baseline characteristics and comorbidities were identified for risk stratification. Results We identified 11639 patients in the AUD cohort and 46556 patients in the control cohort. Compared to patients in the control cohort, those in the AUD group were more likely to have multiple comorbidities (p < 0.001 for all comorbidities). After adjustment of age, gender, baseline comorbidities, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, the diagnosis of AUD was associated with an increased risk of CKD development (aHR = 1.62, 95% CI, 1.46–1.81). During the mean follow up periods of 6.47 (standard deviation (SD) = 3.80) years for the AUD cohort and 7.23 (SD = 3.75) years for the control cohort, the overall incidence density of CKD was significantly higher in patients with AUD than those in the control cohort (3.48 vs 6.51 per 1000 person-years, aHR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.50–1.87). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the AUD cohort had a higher cumulative incidence of CKD than the control cohort (log-rank test, p value < 0.001). Patients with AUD had higher risks of CKD in all the stratified groups, except for the subgroup with age over 65 years old. Conclusion Our study suggested that AUD was associated with an increased incidence of newly diagnosed CKD by nearly two folds. Young age, in particular, had a higher association between AUD and CKD. Considering the preventable nature of AUD, establishing effective health policies is imperative to reduce high-risk alcohol behaviors and thereby prevent alcohol-related kidney disease. Further prospective studies are warranted to further elucidate the causation of AUD on kidney function."
https://openalex.org/W2890830469,"Antiestrogens (AEs) are widely used for treatment of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast cancer, but display variable degrees of partial agonism in estrogen target tissues and breast cancer (BC) cells. The fact that BC cells resistant to selective ER modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen (Tam) can still be sensitive to pure AEs, also called selective ER downregulators, suggests different mechanisms of action, some of which may contribute to the more complete suppression of estrogen target genes by pure AEs. We report herein that pure AEs such as fulvestrant induce transient binding of ERα to DNA, followed by rapid release after 30–40 min without loss of nuclear localization. Loss of DNA binding preceded receptor degradation and was not prevented by proteasome inhibition. Chromatin was less accessible in the presence of fulvestrant than with estradiol or Tam as early as 20 min following treatment, suggesting that chromatin remodeling by pure AEs at ERα target regions prevents transcription in spite of receptor binding. SUMO2/3 marks were detected on chromatin at the peak of ERα binding in cells treated with pure AEs, but not SERMs. Furthermore, decreasing SUMOylation by overexpressing the deSUMOylase SENP1 significantly delayed receptor release from DNA and de-repressed expression of estrogen target genes in the presence of fulvestrant, both in ERα-expressing MCF-7 cells and in transiently transfected ER-negative SK-BR-3 cells. Finally, mutation V534E, identified in a breast metastasis resistant to hormonal therapies, prevented ERα modification and resulted in increased transcriptional activity of estrogen target genes in the presence of fulvestrant in SK-BR-3 cells. Together, our results establish a role for SUMOylation in achieving a more complete transcriptional shut-off of estrogen target genes by pure AEs vs. SERMs in BC cells."

https://openalex.org/W2890361490,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection is difficult to control because the virus undergoes antigenic variation during infection and also modulates the protective host immune response. Although current vaccines do not provide full protection, they have provided insight into the mechanisms of protection. Live PRRSV vaccines induce partial protection before the appearance of neutralizing antibody, suggesting cell-mediated immunity or other mechanisms may be involved. Herein, we demonstrate recovery from infection is associated with development of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that can kill PRRSV-infected target cells. Initial experiments showed survival of PRRSV-infected monocyte derived macrophage (MDM) targets is reduced when overlaid with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from gilts that had recovered from PRRSV infection. Further studies with PBMC depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells and positively selected subpopulations of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were involved in killing. Examination of killing at different time points revealed killing was biphasic and mediated by CTL of different phenotypes. CD4+CD8+high were associated with killing target cells infected for 3–6 hours. CD4+CD8- CTL were associated with killing at 16–24 hours. Thus, all the anti-PRRSV CTL activity in pigs was attributed to two phenotypes of CD4+ cells which is different from the anti-viral CD4-CD8+ CTL phenotype found in most other animals. These findings will be useful for evaluating CTL responses induced by current and future vaccines, guiding to a novel direction for future vaccine development."

H2O2 has been shown to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling depending on the cellular context. We report here that in human articular chondrocytes, the MAPK family member c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) is activated by fibronectin fragments and low physiological levels of H2O2 and inhibited by oxidation due to elevated levels of H2O2 The kinase activity of affinity-purified, phosphorylated JNK2 from cultured chondrocytes was reversibly inhibited by 5-20 μm H2O2 Using dimedone-based chemical probes that react specifically with sulfenylated cysteines (RSOH), we identified Cys-222 in JNK2, a residue not conserved in JNK1 or JNK3, as a redox-reactive site. MS analysis of human recombinant JNK2 also detected further oxidation at Cys-222 and other cysteines to sulfinic (RSO2H) or sulfonic (RSO3H) acid. H2O2 treatment of JNK2 resulted in detectable levels of peptides containing intramolecular disulfides between Cys-222 and either Cys-213 or Cys-177, without evidence of dimer formation. Substitution of Cys-222 to alanine rendered JNK2 insensitive to H2O2 inhibition, unlike C177A and C213A variants. Two other JNK2 variants, C116A and C163A, were also resistant to oxidative inhibition. Cumulatively, these findings indicate differential regulation of JNK2 signaling dependent on H2O2 levels and point to key cysteine residues regulating JNK2 activity. As levels of intracellular H2O2 rise, a switch occurs from activation to inhibition of JNK2 activity, linking JNK2 regulation to the redox status of the cell."

There is insufficient knowledge on the extent of diagnostic delay and the associated factors in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). The aims of this study were to assess the health care seeking behaviour, EPTB knowledge and diagnostic delay in presumptive EPTB patients at the main referral hospital in Zanzibar, factors associated with longer delay, and the impact of untreated EPTB on self-rated health. Materials and methods Prospective data collection using a semi-structured questionnaire in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of EPTB. The time between the onset of symptoms and first visit to a health care provider (patient delay), and then to the initiation of treatment (health system delay) and total delay were analysed according to sociodemographic and clinical factors and health care seeking trajectories. The EQ-5D-3L was used among the adult EPTB patients to assess the impact of treatment on self-rated health. Results Of the 132 patients with median age of 27 years (interquartile range 8–41), 69 were categorized as TB cases and 63 as non-TB cases. The median patient, health system and total delays were 14, 34 and 62 days respectively, among the EPTB patients. A longer health system delay with repeated visits to the same health care level was reported. Significantly better self-rated health status was described after treatment. The knowledge regarding extrapulmonary disease was low. Conclusion Many EPTB patients, presenting to the main referral hospital in Zanzibar, experience a long delay in the initiation of treatment, specially patients with TB lymphadenitis. The health system delay is the major contributor to the total delay. The improvement of self-rated health after treatment implies that timely treatment has the potential to reduce morbidity and the economic loss for the patient."

Co-chaperones such as P23, cell division cycle 37 (CDC37), or activator of HSP90 ATPase activity 1 (AHA1) interact with the N-terminal or middle domain of HSP90, whereas others, such as HSP70/HSP90-organizing protein (HOP), use tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains to bind the EEVD motif at the very C-terminal end of HSP90. Recently, the lysine methyltransferase SET and MYND domain–containing 2 (SMYD2) has been proposed as an HSP90-binding partner, and interaction analyses indicate that SMYD2 binding to HSP90 is independent of the EEVD motif. Using the amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (Alpha) technique, I identified a new (M/I/L/V)PXL motif at the C termini of HSP90 and P23 that mediates an interaction with SMYD2, and synthetic peptides harboring this motif dissociated this complex. Of note, the HSP90- and P23-dependent client estrogen receptor α (ERα), was a major methylation target of SMYD2. In a reconstituted system in bacteria, I analyzed HSP90/P23–associated, SMYD2-mediated ERα methylation and found that when SMYD2 binds to the molecular chaperones, it considerably increases methylation of Lys-266 in ERα. Because methylation represses ERα activity, the observed complex formation between SMYD2 and HSP90/P23 may contribute to ERα regulation.

HSP90 is a major molecular chaperone in the eukaryotic cytosol that oversees folding and degradation of a subset of client proteins and therefore contributes to cellular protein homeostasis. The HSP90 client spectrum ranges from steroid hormone receptors (e.g. glucocorticoid receptor, progesterone receptor, and estrogen receptor) and protein kinases (e.g. SRC, CDK4, and AKT) to transcription factors (e.g. OCT4 or P53 tumor suppressor) and others such as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or Tau protein (1.Schopf F.H.

Many client proteins, when mutated or deregulated, are related to well-known diseases such as various cancer types, cystic fibrosis, and neurodegenerative disorders (1.Schopf F.H. Biebl M.M.

To fulfill its tasks, HSP90 is assisted by a multitude of cochaperone proteins that modulate its ATP hydrolysis rate or mediate the interaction with client proteins.

Accordingly, SMYD2 consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain (N-lobe) and a C-terminal domain (C-lobe) with structural similarity to the TPR domains of cochaperone proteins that bind to the EEVD motif of HSP90. Therefore, it was proposed that the C-lobe of SMYD2 may bind to HSP90 in a manner similar to the TPR clamp mechanism of HSP90 cochaperones, such as HOP (15.Jiang Y. Sirinupong N. Brunzelle J. Yang Z. Crystal structures of histone and p53 methyltransferase SmyD2 reveal a conformational flexibility of the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21738746): e2164010.1371/journal.pone.0021640Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis was never tested experimentally. Moreover, the purpose of the SMYD2–HSP90 interaction remains elusive, although one may speculate that the molecular chaperone may affect SMYD2 target protein methylation. In the present study, binding of SMYD2 to HSP90 and HOP to HSP90 was compared and found to be fundamentally different. Whereas HOP interaction required the C-terminal EEVD motif of HSP90, this sequence was dispensable for SMYD2 binding. Using Alpha (amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay) for interaction analysis, an (M/I/L/V)PXL motif, present in HSP90 and in the cochaperone P23, was identified as the binding site for SMYD2. When SMYD2-catalyzed lysine methylation of P53, ERα, and HSP90 was compared, ERα turned out to be the major target. The HSP90/P23–dependent client protein ERα was used to investigate the functional role of HSP90/P23–SMYD2 complex formation. To that purpose, an HSP90/P23–chaperoned ERα expression system was reconstituted. Efficient lysine methylation of ERα depended on interaction between SMYD2 and the molecular chaperones HSP90/P23. This suggests that the molecular chaperone–SMYD2 alliance may keep ERα in an inactive methylated state during folding, before activation by estrogen. Accordingly, HSP90/P23 contribute to another layer of ERα regulation by SMYD2-dependent methylation. Previous studies reported that SMYD2 binds to the molecular chaperone HSP90 in human culture cells (11.Abu-Farha M. Lambert J.P. Al-Madhoun A.S. Elisma F. Skerjanc I.S. Figeys D. The tale of two domains: proteomics and genomics analysis of SMYD2, a new histone methyltransferase.Mol. Cell.

To test this observation, SMYD2 and HOP were mixed with HSP90α, and the interaction was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (19.Harst A. Lin H. Obermann W.M.J.

A shift of the SMYD2 elution profile and co-migration together with HSP90α indicated complex formation between the two proteins, independent of nucleotide (Fig. 1A). Likewise, SMYD2 bound to HSP90β indistinguishably from HSP90α (Fig. 1A). It was proposed that the C-lobe of SMYD2 is a TPR-like domain and binds to HSP90 dependent on the EEVD motif, similar to cochaperone proteins such as HOP or DNAJC7 (7.Scheufler C. Brinker A.

However, alignment of the SMYD2 C-lobe sequence with bona fide TPR domains of HSP90 binding partners revealed that amino acid residues of the dicarboxylate clamp responsible for EEVD interaction are not conserved in SMYD2 (Fig. S1). This suggests that the EEVD motif is dispensable for interaction with SMYD2. To test this assumption, the EEVD motif of HSP90α was cleaved off, and the truncated protein (HSP90αΔ EEVD) was analyzed for complex formation with SMYD2 and HOP (Fig. 1A). Whereas HSP90αΔEEVD showed no interaction with HOP as expected, SMYD2 binding to HSP90α did not require the EEVD motif (Fig. 1A), although SMYD2 binding was mediated by HSP90αC (Fig. 1B). This suggests that SMYD2, in contrast to HOP, does not use the TPR clamp mechanism for interaction with HSP90. Furthermore, the catalytic SMYD2N-lobe was sufficient for interaction with HSP90α (Fig. 1C). To determine whether SMYD2 forms complexes with yet unidentified partners, the methyltransferase was applied as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen using a universal human library. Hits identified were fragments encompassing amino acids 697–732 in the C terminus of HSP90α, confirming the result shown in Fig. 1B, and amino acids 110–160, representing a C-terminal fragment of the HSP90 cochaperone P23 (Fig. S2). Interaction between SMYD2 and P23 was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography using the purified proteins (Fig. 1D). The results of the protein interaction analysis are compiled in Fig. 1E. In summary, SMYD2 forms complexes with both chaperone partners HSP90 and P23 (Fig. 1F). Based on the result of the yeast two-hybrid screen, the binding site between SMYD2 and HSP90α could be mapped to a C-terminal fragment of the molecular chaperone comprising amino acids 697–732, consistent with the biochemical data (Fig. 1B). Alpha technology (22.Ihrig V. Obermann W.M.J. Identifying inhibitors of the Hsp90-AhaI protein complex, a potential target to drug cystic fibrosis, by Alpha technology.SLAS Discov. 2017; 22 (28346090): 923-928PubMed Google Scholar) was used to further explore the interaction between SMYD2 and the HSP90 polypeptide (Fig. 2A). Candidate proteins are attached to GST donor beads or nickel-chelate acceptor beads and brought to close proximity upon protein interaction. Laser excitation leads to emittance of singlet oxygen from donor beads and triggers emission of luminescence by acceptor beads that can be quantified. Mutant proteins or the addition of inhibitors prevent interaction-dependent excitation of acceptor beads (Fig. 2A). A variety of GST-HSP90α fusion peptides and His6-tagged SMYD2 or SMYD2N proteins were purified and analyzed for interaction (Fig. S3 and Table S1). Full-length HSP90, HSP90C, and HSP90(697–732) bound to SMYD2, whereas HSP90(1–696) did not (Fig. 2B). Subsequently, HSP90(697–732) was trimmed at both termini, and the GST-fused fragments were tested for binding to SMYD2. Eventually, the nonapeptide EMPPLEGDD (HSP90(715–723)) was identified to be sufficient for interaction with SMYD2 (Fig. 2B). In an effort to locate the peptide binding site on SMYD2, the smallest protein that could be stably expressed was SMYD2(1–240). This fragment bound to HSP90(715–723) equally well as full-length SMYD2 (Fig. 2C). Next, the sequence motif essential for HSP90α–SMYD2 complex formation should be identified. Therefore, peptide EMPPLEGDD was subjected to iterative rounds of amino acid substitutions, and the mutant peptides were purified and analyzed for interaction with SMYD2 by Alpha (Fig. S4 and Table S2). It turned out that the motif (M/I/L/V)PXL, where Met could be substituted with amino acid Ile, Leu, or Val and X could be any amino acid in HSP90α, was essential for binding to SMYD2 (Fig. 2D). The corresponding sequence in HSP90β is IPPL, consistent with this finding (Fig. 2D). To further corroborate the (M/I/L/V)PXL motif as the SMYD2-binding site, the essential proline was substituted by an alanine, leading to HSP90αP717A, and the full-length protein was purified. After the addition of SMYD2 or HOP, complex formation was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2E). The P717A mutation starkly affected binding to SMYD2 but did not alter interaction with HOP, confirming the specificity of the (M/I/L/V)PXL motif for SMYD2. Another binding partner of SMYD2 is the cochaperone P23, and the interaction of the fragment P23(110–160) with the methyltransferase could be verified by Alpha based on GST-tagged P23 proteins (Fig. S5A and Table S3). Sequence alignment using the HSP90α peptide revealed the presence of an (M/I/L/V)PXL motif at the very C terminus of P23, suggesting that this piece is responsible for P23–SMYD2 complex formation (Fig. 2F). Mutation of each of the amino acids Met-156, Pro-158, and Leu-159 in Pro-23 to alanine completely abolished binding of P23 to SMYD2, confirming that the cochaperone uses its very C-terminal end for interaction with the methyltransferase (Fig. S5A and Table S3). To test whether SMYD2 binds to other GST-tagged chaperone proteins, a C-terminal part of Hsc70 (Hsc70C), HOP, and AHA1 were purified and analyzed by Alpha (Fig. S5B). Neither Hsc70C nor any of the cochaperones bound to the methyltransferase (Table S3). Several cochaperone proteins compete with each other for binding to HSP90, although they employ different sites on the molecular chaperone for interaction (19.Harst A. Lin H. Obermann W.M.J. Aha1 competes with HOP, p50 and p23 for binding to the molecular chaperone Hsp90 and contributes to kinase and hormone receptor activation.Biochem.

Therefore, HSP90-HOP and HSP90-AHA1 were incubated with SMYD2, and complex dissociation was analyzed. Although HOP and AHA1 use a binding motif or interaction site different from SMYD2, the methyltransferase disturbs complex formation with HSP90, suggesting steric overlap between SMYD2 and the cochaperones HOP and AHA1 (Fig. 2G). SMYD2 was originally described as a histone H3 lysine 36–specific methyltransferase (10.Brown M.A. Sims 3rd, R.J. Gottlieb P.D. Tucker P.W.

For comparability, target lysines were at the same position within each sequence, using the P53(358–393) peptide as a blueprint (17.Wang L. Li L. Zhang H. Luo X. Dai J. Zhou S. Gu J. Zhu J. Atadja P. Lu C. Li E. Zhao K. Structure of human SMYD2 protein reveals the basis of p53 tumor suppressor methylation.J. Biol.

After incubation with SMYD2, lysine methylation was detected with two different specific antibodies. Relative signal intensity was strongest with ERα(254–289), considerably weaker with P53(358–393), and invisible with HSP90α(603–638) or His6-HSP90(544–732), suggesting that ERα is a major SMYD2 methylation target (Fig. 3B). To ensure that Lys-266 is indeed the SMYD2-dependent methylation target in ERα(254–289), mutants K266A and K266R were tested, and both abolished the lysine methylation signal (Fig. 3C). SMYD2 catalytic activity toward P53 can be inhibited by LLY-507, a chemical compound that is specific for this methyltransferase (24.Nguyen H. Allali-Hassani A. Antonysamy S. Chang S. Chen L.H. Curtis C. Emtage S. Fan L. Gheyi T. Li F. Liu S. Martin J.R. Mendel D. Olsen J.B.

Thus, we tested methylation of the target peptide ERα(254–289) in the presence of LLY-507 (Fig. 3D). As a result, SMYD2-catalyzed ERα(254–289) methylation was disturbed by LLY-507 in a concentration-dependent manner. The next aim was to examine the effect of (M/I/L/V)PXL-mediated SMYD2–chaperone association on the methylation status of ERα. Identification of this motif allowed synthesis of short peptides derived from HSP90α and P23 that contain the SMYD2-binding sequence. Accordingly, peptides HSP90(707–723) spanning the amino acid sequence DTSAAVTEEMPPLEGDD and P23(147–160) spanning the sequence DSQDSDDEKMPDLE were made. To test the potency of the peptides to interfere with binding, HSP90α–SMYD2 and P23–SMYD2 protein complexes were incubated with various concentrations of the peptides, and dissociation was measured by Alpha (Fig. 4A). 90C12mer (GDDDTSRMEEVD), a peptide that disturbs binding of TPR proteins to HSP90 (7.Scheufler C.

HSP90(707–723) and P23(147–160) readily abrogated formation of homologous HSP90α–SMYD2 and P23–SMYD2 complexes with an IC50 in the low micromolar range (Fig. 4A). In the heterologous situation, P23(147–160) was even more efficient toward HSP90α-SMYD2 than HSP90(707–723), but toward the P23–SMYD2 complex, HSP90(707–723) was ∼10-fold less effective compared with P23(147–160). Given that the (M/I/L/V)PXL motif sits at the very end of P23 but is flanked by C-terminal amino acids in HSP90, P23 might be accommodated more readily by SMYD2, resulting in higher binding affinity. To confirm the results obtained by Alpha, HSP90α and SMYD2 were mixed; incubated with peptide HSP90(707–723), P23(147–160), 90C12mer, or LLY-507; and analyzed for interaction by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. S6). HSP90(707–723) and P23(147–160) but neither 90C12mer nor LLY-507 dissociated HSP90–SMYD2 complexes. To set up a test system to explore the effect of (M/I/L/V)PXL-mediated SMYD2–chaperone association on the methylation status of ERα, the hormone receptor should be expressed alone or together with chaperones HSP90α and P23 and methylated by SMYD2. Therefore, ERα(254–595) was cloned as a GST fusion protein. This fragment contains the hinge region of ERα with the SMYD2 methylation target Lys-266 and the C-terminal part of the receptor that harbors the ligand binding domain and associates with HSP90 and P23 (25.Aumais J.P.

To clarify the features of picosecond lasers, we compared picosecond and nanosecond lasers in their ability to remove multi-colored tattoo in an animal model. We first compared a nanosecond quality-switched Nd:YAG laser with picosecond Alexandrite and quality-switched Nd:YAG lasers and then the picosecond quality-switched Nd:YAG laser with the picosecond Alexandrite laser, using a guinea pig model. The colors in the tattoos included red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and black. Guinea pigs were treated for one session with each type of laser. The clearance of pigmentation and local reactions were evaluated based on clinical photographic assessment, quantitative assessment using a colorimeter, histopathology, and electron microscopic examination before laser treatment, immediately after, and at 3 weeks after the treatment. Regardless of pulse duration, a 532-nm laser was the most effective in clearing red, orange, and yellow pigments, although the overall effect and safety was better with the picosecond 532 nm laser. A picosecond 755 nm laser demonstrated excellent efficacy in removing only green and blue pigments. a picosecond 1064 nm laser demonstrated some effects on non-black colored tattoos. In terms of safety, picosecond lasers produced less tissue injury than nanosecond lasers. Conclusively, picosecond lasers are more effective and safer than nanosecond lasers."
https://openalex.org/W2890960173,"In Bangladesh, female paramedics known as Family Welfare Visitors (FWVs), conduct normal deliveries in first-level primary care facilities, or Union Health and Family Welfare Centres (UH&FWC). Utilization of partographs allow for early identification of abnormal labour and referral for advanced care to Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) facilities. A systematic assessment of the quality of partograph utilization in clinical-decision making will contribute to understanding the use of the tool by health workers.In 2013, the USAID supported MaMoni HSS project, led in country by Save the Children, trained FWVs on the use of partographs in five UH&FWCs in Habiganj district. As part of the follow-up after training, intrapartum case record forms, accompanying partographs, and referral registers for all obstetric cases managed in these five facilities from July 2013 to June 2014 were reviewed. Partographs were reviewed to identify abnormal labour cases based on pre-defined indications. All referred cases were ascertained from the case records in the referral registers. Five health workers were interviewed to assess their knowledge, attitude and experience in partograph use and to explore the challenges for referral decision making associated with the tool.A total of 1,198 deliveries were managed at the study sites, of which 663 presented with cervical dilatation of 8 cm or less. Partographs were initiated in 98% of these cases. Indication of abnormal labour was found in 71 partographs (11%) and among them, only 1 was referred to a higher-level facility. Foetal heart rate and cervical dilatation were appropriately recorded in 61% and 70% of the partographs, respectively. Interviews with health workers revealed poor interpretation of referral indications from the partographs. Limited accessibility to the nearest EmOC facility, inadequate time for referral, and non-compliance to referral by clients were identified by the interviewed health workers as the key barriers for referral decision making.Supporting the health workers at first-level primary care facilities to better interpret and act on partograph data in a timely manner, and strengthening the referral systems are needed to ensure that women in labour receive the prompt quality care they and their babies require to survive."
https://openalex.org/W2891998808,"Little is known on the role of selenoprotein genes in cardiovascular disease. This study examines the associations of the SEPP1, SELENOS, TXNRD1, TXNRD2, GPX4, and SOD2 polymorphisms and selenoprotein P (SeP) and thioredoxin concentrations with the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOID), as well as their influence on cardiac phenotype.564 patients with AAA, 400 patients with AIOD, and 543 controls were enrolled and characterized for coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and systolic heart failure (HF) occurrence. In AAA, the coexistence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was examined. Genotypes were determined using TaqMan-based assays. Selenoprotein concentration was assessed using the ELISA method.The SELENOS rs34713741T, SEPP1 rs3877899A, and GPX4 rs713041T alleles were related to a 30-60% increase in the AIOD/PAD risk in the recessive or dominant model (all associations at P < .05). The SEPP1 rs3877899A allele was a protective factor for the development of AAA without concomitant PAD (OR = 0.68 for the dominant model, P = .014), but not AAA with concomitant PAD. The cumulative two-locus effects of selenoprotein genes on the AAA/AIOD risk were observed, including the multiplicative interaction between the SELENOS rs34713741T and GPX4 rs713041T alleles (both in the recessive model) affecting the AIOD risk (OR = 5.27, P = .001) and its clinical phenotype. Coexistence of HF in aortic diseases was related to both the SEPP1 rs7579A allele (OR = 1.83 for carriers, P = .013) and increased SeP concentrations; SeP level ≥8.5 mg/mL caused a 3.5-fold increase in the risk of HF. In AAA, SeP levels were correlated with BMI (r = -0.575, P < .0001).Our results provide evidence that selenoprotein polymorphisms constitute a risk factor for HF and peripheral atherosclerosis, but prevent the development of AAA. Excessive weight might result in reduced antioxidant reserve efficiency in AAA. Validation studies are required to establish whether SeP concentration may be a marker for HF."
https://openalex.org/W2891263701,"Poor health worker performance is a well-documented obstacle to quality service provision. Due to the increasingly widespread availability of mobile devices, mobile health (mHealth) has received growing attention as a service improvement tool. This pilot study explored feasibility, acceptability and outcomes of an mHealth intervention designed to increase coverage of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) in two districts of West Nile, Uganda. In both districts, selected health workers (N = 48) received classroom training on malaria in pregnancy. All health workers in one district (N = 49) subsequently received 24 text messages reinforcing the training content. The intervention was evaluated using a mixed-methods approach, including four focus group discussions with health workers and three in-depth interviews with district health officials, health worker knowledge assessments one month (N = 90) and six months (N = 89) after the classroom training, and calculation of IPTp coverage from participating health facilities’ (N = 16) antenatal care registers covering six months pre- and post-intervention. Complementing classroom training with text messaging was found to be a feasible, acceptable and inexpensive approach to improving health worker performance. The messages served as reminders to those who had attended the classroom training and helped spread information to those who had not. Health workers in the district where text messages were sent had significantly better knowledge of IPTp, achieving an increased composite knowledge score of 6.00 points (maximum score: 40) compared with those in the district where only classroom training was provided. Average facility coverage of three doses of IPTp was also significantly higher where text messages were sent (85.8%) compared with the district where only classroom training was provided (54.1%). This intervention shows promise for the improvement of health worker performance for delivery of IPTp, and could have significant broader application."

https://openalex.org/W2890307354,"Recently, various studies have clarified that humans can immediately make social evaluations from facial appearance and that such judgment have an important role in several social contexts. However, the origins and early development of this skill have not been well investigated. To clarify the mechanisms for the acquisition of this skill, we examined whether 6- to 8-month-old infants show a preference for a more trustworthy-looking person. Results showed that infants preferred a trustworthy face to an untrustworthy one when both faces were high in dominance. This difference was not seen when both faces were low in dominance. Moreover, this preference disappeared when the faces were upside down. These findings suggest that the perception of trustworthiness based on facial appearance emerges in early development with little social experience. Further research is needed to verify whether infants also perceive other traits, such as competence."

https://openalex.org/W2890370438,"Background The WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) was established to address important safety issues and to reduce the number of surgical deaths. So far, numerous reports have demonstrated sub-optimal implementation of the SSC in practice and limited improvements in patient outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to audit the SSC-practice in a real-world setting in a university hospital setting. Methods From 2015 to 2016, independent observers performed snapshot audits in operating theatres and shadowed the three phases of the SSC. Using a 4-point Likert-scale to rate the compliance on each audit day, we generated a report highlighting possible improvements and provided feedback to the operating team members. Results Audits were performed on 36 operating days (2015: n = 19; 2016: n = 17), in which a total of 136 surgical interventions were observed. Overall, the percentage of “very good compliance” improved from 2015 to 2016: for the sign-in from 52.9% to 81.2% (p = 0.141), for the team-time-out from 33.3% to 58.8% (p = 0.181), and for the sign-out from 21.4% to 41.7% (p = 0.401). The qualitative review revealed inconsistencies when applying the SSC, of which the missing documentation of an actually performed item or the wrong timing for an item was most common. Conclusion Snapshot audits revealed that SSC compliance has improved over the observed period, while its application revealed inconsistencies during the three phases of the SSC. Snapshot audits proved to be a valuable tool in the qualitative analysis of SSC compliance and gave more insight than a mere completeness check of ticks in SSC documents."
https://openalex.org/W2890610831,"Adherent cells such as endothelial cells sense applied mechanical stretch to adapt to changes in their surrounding mechanical environment. Despite numerous studies, signaling pathways underlying the cellular mechanosensing and adaptation remain to be fully elucidated partly because of the lack of tools that allow for a comprehensive screening approach. Conventionally, multi-well cell culture plates of standard configurations are used for comprehensive analyses in cell biology study to identify key molecules in a high-throughput manner. Given that situation, here we design a 96-well cell culture plate made of elastic silicone and mechanically stretchable using a motorized device. Computational analysis suggested that highly uniform stretch can be applied to each of the wells other than the peripheral wells. Elastic image registration-based experimental evaluation on stretch distributions within individual wells revealed the presence of larger variations among wells compared to those in the computational analysis, but a stretch level of 10%-that has been employed in conventional studies on cellular response to stretch-was almost achieved with our setup. We exposed vascular smooth muscle cells to cyclic stretch using the device to demonstrate morphological repolarization of the cells, i.e. typical cellular response to cyclic stretch. Because the deformable multi-well plate validated here is compatible with other high-throughput screening-oriented technologies, we expect this novel system to be utilized for future comprehensive analyses of stretch-related signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2889700241,"Study of plant metabolome is a growing field of science that catalogs vast biochemical and functional diversity of phytochemicals. However, collecting and storing samples of plant metabolome, sharing these samples across the scientific community and making them compatible with bioactivity assays presents significant challenges to the advancement of metabolome research. We have developed a RApid Metabolome Extraction and Storage (RAMES) technology that allows efficient, highly compact, field-deployable collection and storage of libraries of plant metabolome. RAMES technology combines rapid extraction with immobilization of extracts on glass microfiber filter discs. Two grams of plant tissue extracted in ethanol, using a specially adapted Dremel® rotary tool, produces 25-35 replicas of 10 mm glass fiber discs impregnated with phytochemicals. These discs can be either eluted with solvents (such as 70% ethanol) to study the metabolomic profiles or used directly in a variety of functional assays. We have developed simple, non-sterile, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-oxidant assays formatted for 24-multiwell plates directly compatible with RAMES discs placed inside the wells. Using these methods we confirmed activity in 30 out of 32 randomly selected anti-microbial medicinal plants and spices. Seven species scored the highest activity (total kill) in the anti-bacterial (bacteria from human saliva) and two anti-fungal screens (Fusarium spp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), providing functional validation of RAMES technology. RAMES libraries showed limited degradation of compounds after 12 months of storage at -20°C, while others remained stable. Fifty-eight percent of structures characterized in the extracts loaded onto RAMES discs could be eluted from the discs without significant losses. Miniaturized RAMES technology, as described and validated in this manuscript offers a labor, cost, and time-effective alternative to conventional collection of phytochemicals. RAMES technology enables creation of comprehensive metabolomic libraries from various ecosystems and geographical regions in a format compatible with further biochemical and functional studies."
https://openalex.org/W2892246728,"Young adults demonstrate a small, but consistent, asymmetry of spatial attention favouring the left side of space (""pseudoneglect"") in laboratory-based tests of perception. Conversely, in more naturalistic environments, behavioural errors towards the right side of space are often observed. In the older population, spatial attention asymmetries are generally diminished, or even reversed to favour the right side of space, but much of this evidence has been gained from lab-based and/or psychophysical testing. In this study we assessed whether spatial biases can be elicited during a simulated driving task, and secondly whether these biases also shift with age, in line with standard lab-based measures. Data from 77 right-handed adults with full UK driving licences (i.e. prior experience of left-lane driving) were analysed: 38 young (mean age = 21.53) and 39 older adults (mean age = 70.38). Each participant undertook 3 tests of visuospatial attention: the landmark task, line bisection task, and a simulated lane-keeping task. We found leftward biases in young adults for the landmark and line bisection tasks, indicative of pseudoneglect, and a mean lane position towards the right of centre. In young adults the leftward landmark task biases were negatively correlated with rightward lane-keeping biases, hinting that a common property of the spatial attention networks may have influenced both tasks. As predicted, older adults showed no group-level spatial asymmetry on the landmark nor the line bisection task, but they maintained a mean rightward lane position, similar to young adults. The 3 tasks were not inter-correlated in the older group. These results suggest that spatial biases in older adults may be elicited more effectively in experiments involving complex behaviour rather than abstract, lab-based measures. More broadly, these results confirm that lateral biases of spatial attention are linked to driving behaviour, and this could prove informative in the development of future vehicle safety and driving technology."
https://openalex.org/W2891225687,"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is one of several E. coli pathotypes that infect the intestinal tract and cause disease. Formation of the characteristic attaching and effacing lesion on the surface of infected cells causes significant remodeling of the host cell surface; however, limited information is available about changes at the protein level. Here we employed plasma membrane profiling, a quantitative cell-surface proteomics technique, to identify host proteins whose cell-surface levels are altered during infection. Using this method, we quantified more than 1100 proteins, 280 of which showed altered cell-surface levels after exposure to EHEC. 22 host proteins were significantly reduced on the surface of infected epithelial cells. These included both known and unknown targets of EHEC infection. The complement decay-accelerating factor cluster of differentiation 55 (CD55) exhibited the greatest reduction in cell-surface levels during infection. We showed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis that CD55 is cleaved from the cell surface by the EHEC-specific protease StcE and found that StcE-mediated CD55 cleavage results in increased neutrophil adhesion to the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. This suggests that StcE alters host epithelial surfaces to depress neutrophil transepithelial migration during infection. This work is the first report of the global manipulation of the epithelial cell surface by a bacterial pathogen and illustrates the power of quantitative cell-surface proteomics in uncovering critical aspects of bacterial infection biology."

However, specific investigation of the risk of prostate cancer and the influence of COPD pharmacotherapy in patients with COPD is lacking. This study investigated the risk and influence of COPD pharmacotherapy on risk of prostate cancer in patients with COPD. Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan’s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005). The study cohort comprised COPD patients who received treatment between 2004 and 2008, and who were identified from the LHID2005. The control cohort comprised patients without COPD and was matched to the study cohort by age and sex. Two-stage propensity score calibration with the National Health Interview Survey 2005 was performed to obtain the missing confounders of smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index in the LHID. The hazard ratio (HR) and adjusted HR were estimated. Moreover, the influence of inhaled medications and other related medication on the risk of prostate cancer was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression. Results The COPD cohort comprised 12,774 patients, and the control cohort comprised 38,322 patients (1:3). The incidence of prostate cancer was 633 per 100,000 person-years in the COPD cohort and 361 per 100,000 person-years in the control cohort. The propensity score calibration-adjusted HR was 1.62 (95% CI, 1.40–1.87, p < 0.001) in the COPD cohort. Further analysis revealed that the adjusted HR for the risk of prostate cancer was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.19–2.16, p = 0.002) in patients with COPD who used short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.40–2.54, p < 0.001) in patients with COPD who used short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs). COPD patients had lower risk of prostate cancer when using statin (HR = 0.63, 95% CI, 0.45–0.89, p = 0.010) or aspirin (HR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.35–0.85, p = 0.008). Conclusion Patients with COPD are at a higher risk of prostate cancer, particularly those using SAMAs or SABAs. This finding suggests that inflammation control may be an effective strategy for decreasing the risk of prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2890737918,"Background The aim of this study was to identify whether informal caregiving time is associated with personality factors longitudinally. Methods Longitudinal data were gathered from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), a large nationally representative, longitudinal study of German households beginning in 1984. Focusing on the association between informal caregiving and personality factors, data were used from the years 2005, 2009 and 2013. The GSOEP Big Five Inventory was used to assess personality factors. Informal caregiving hours were used as explanatory variable. The explanatory variable informal caregiving hours was categorized into 0 hours (reference), 1 hours, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, and 5 hours and more. Age, marital status, educational level, employment status, income, self-rated health and disability were included as potential confounders in regression analysis. Results Adjusting for potential confounders, fixed effects regressions showed that whether or not someone provides informal care is markedly associated with changes in neuroticism. Given that an individual provides informal care, the actual number of care hours did not matter in most cases. Informal caregiving was not associated with openness to experience, extraversion and agreeableness. As regards conscientiousness, only ‘5 hours and more’ on a typical Sunday was associated with an increase in conscientiousness (β = .32, p < .05). Informal caregiving on a typical weekday or Saturday was not associated with changes in conscientiousness. Conclusion Our findings stress the longitudinal association between informal caregiving and neuroticism."
