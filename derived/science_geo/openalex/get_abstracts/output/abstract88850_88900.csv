https://openalex.org/W1993236244,"Figures in which human observers perceive ""illusory contours"" were found to evoke responses in cells of area 18 in the visual cortex of alert monkeys. The cells responded as if the contours were formed by real lines or edges. Modifications that weakened the perception of contours also reduced the neuronal responses. In contrast, cells in area 17 were apparently unable to ""see"" these contours."
https://openalex.org/W2063837791,"Cellular oncogenes have been implicated in the induction of malignant transformation in some model systems in vitro and may be related to malignancies in vivo in some vertebrate species. This article describes a study of the expression of 15 cellular oncogenes in fresh human tumors from 54 patients, representing 20 different tumor types. More than one cellular oncogene was transcriptionally active in all of the tumors examined. In 14 patients it was possible to study normal and malignant tissue from the same organ. In many of these patients, the transcriptional activity of certain oncogenes was greater in the malignant than the normal tissue. The cellular fes (feline sarcoma) oncogene, not previously known to be transcribed in mammalian tissue, was found to be active in lung and hematopoietic malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2027305883,"Using a generally applicable assay for specific DNA-binding proteins in crude extracts, we have detected and purified an HMG-like nuclear protein from African green monkey cells that preferentially binds to the 172 bp repeat of alpha-satellite DNA (alpha-DNA). DNAase I footprinting with the purified protein detects three specific binding sites (I-III) per alpha-DNA repeat. Site II is 145 bp (one core nucleosome length) from site III on the adjacent alpha-DNA repeat, while site I lies midway between sites II and III. In the alpha-nucleosome phasing frame corresponding with this arrangement, sites I-III would be brought into mutual proximity by DNA folding in the nucleosome. This phasing frame is identical with the preferred frame detected previously in isolated chromatin. Our results suggest that this new and abundant protein recognizes a family of short, related nucleotide sequences found not only in alpha-DNA but also throughout the genome, and that functions of this protein are mediated through its nucleosome-positioning activity. Such nucleosome-positioning proteins may underlie the sequence specificity of both nucleosome arrangements and higher order chromatin structures."
https://openalex.org/W1963480747,"Grafts of fetal septal tissue rich in cholinergic neurons were implanted as a dissociated cell suspension into the depth of the hippocampal formation in aged rats with severe impairments in spatial learning abilities. After 2 1/2 to 3 months, the rats with grafts, but not the controls, had improved their performance in a spatial learning test. Their improvement was due, at least in part, to an increased ability to use spatial cues in the task. In all animals the grafts had produced an extensive acetylcholinesterase-positive terminal network in the surrounding host hippocampal formation. Thus, the action of cholinergic neurons in the graft onto elements in the host hippocampal circuitry may be a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, prerequisite for the observed functional recovery."

https://openalex.org/W1487452375,"The regulation of kinase activity associated with insulin receptor by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation has been examined using partially purified receptor immobilized on insulin-agarose. The immobilized receptor preparation exhibits predominately tyrosine but also serine and threonine kinase activities toward insulin receptor beta subunit and exogenous histone. Phosphorylation of the insulin receptor preparation with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ATP, followed by washing to remove the unreacted ATP, results in a progressive activation of the receptor kinase activity when assayed in the presence of histone and [gamma-32P]ATP. A maximal 4-fold activation is achieved by prior incubation of receptor with concentrations of ATP approaching 1 mM. High pressure liquid chromatographic analysis of tryptic hydrolysates of the 32P-labeled insulin receptor beta subunit reveals three domains of phosphorylation (designated peaks 1, 2, and 3). Phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues are present in these three domains while peak 2 contains phosphothreonine as well. Thus, at least seven sites are available for phosphorylation on the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Incubation of the phosphorylated insulin receptor with alkaline phosphatase at 15 degrees C results in the selective dephosphorylation of the phosphotyrosine residues on the beta subunit of the receptor while the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine contents are not affected. The dephosphorylation of the receptor is accompanied by a marked 65% inhibition of the receptor kinase activity. Almost 90% of the decrease in [32P]phosphate content of the receptor after alkaline phosphatase treatment is accounted for by a decrease in phosphotyrosine content in peak 2, while very small decreases are observed in peaks 1 and 3, respectively. These results demonstrate that the extent of phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in receptor domain 2 closely parallels the receptor kinase activity state, suggesting phosphorylation of this domain may play a key role in regulating the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1580074093,"The synthesis of phytoalexins (antibiotics) in plant cells is induced by molecules called elicitors. Partial acid hydrolysis of mycelial walls of Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. glycinea solubilized a multicomponent mixture of elicitor-active and elicitor-inactive oligoglucosides. One elicitor-active and seven elicitor-inactive hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitols were purified by gel-filtration, normal-phase partition, and reversed-phase liquid chromatography after reduction with NaBH4. The elicitor-active and all but one of the elicitor-inactive hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitols consisted of 3-, 6-, and 3,6-linked glucopyranosyl residues. The eighth hexa (beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitol consisted of beta-4-linked glucopyranosyl residues. The similarity of the structural characteristics of six of the elicitor-inactive hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitols to the elicitor-active hexa(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glucitol suggested that a highly specific carbohydrate structure was required for elicitor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2064377347,"The properties of active and repressed 5S rna genes in somatic cell chromatin from Xenopus laevis cultured cells were studied by transcription in vitro. The somatic 5S RNA genes, which are active in vivo, are packaged in chromatin as active stable transcription complexes lacking only RNA polymerase III for transcription activity. The oocyte 5S RNA genes, which are inactive in somatic tissues, do not have transcription factors bound to them in purified chromatin and are prevented from binding these factors by a structure dependent on histone H1. In chromatin active stable transcription complexes protect 5S RNA genes from histone H1-mediated repression and H1 binding prevents the formation of stable active transcription complexes."

The flank marking was not elicited by saline, oxytocin, neurotensin, or angiotensin II. Vasopressin was ineffective when injected into other areas of the hypothalamus or into the lateral cerebroventricle."
https://openalex.org/W1991839015,"An ethanol-preferring line of rats, developed by selective breeding, consumed as much as 9.4 ± 1.7 grams of ethanol per kilogram of body weight per day through intragastric self-infusions, yielding blood ethanol concentrations of 92 to 415 milligrams per 100 milliliters. By contrast, the ethanol-nonpreferring line self-administered only 0.7 ± 0.2 gram per kilogram per day. These findings indicate that the reinforcing effect of ethanol is postabsorptive and is not mediated by the drug's smell or taste. Hence the ethanol-preferring line of rats may be a suitable animal model of alcoholism."

https://openalex.org/W1549946077,"The half-cystine residues involved in linking the acidic and basic polypeptides were determined for several glycinin subunits. The cystines were localized with specific cyanogen bromide fragments either by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of nonreduced and reduced fragments, or by co-purifying and then determining the NH2-terminal sequence of the covalently linked fragments. Residues involved in the disulfides were further identified by labeling them with [3H] iodoacetic acid. Only 1 cystine was found to be involved in linking the acidic and basic components of each subunit, and they were in analogous positions in each of the subunits studied. Potential sites for intrapolypeptide cystines were also identified."
https://openalex.org/W1481131609,"Two 8 S forms of progesterone receptor from the chicken oviduct were purified to near homogeneity and analyzed for peptide composition by gel electrophoresis. Form I contains two major peptides with molecular weights of 90,000 and 75,000. Form II also contains two major peptides with molecular weights of 90,000 and 110,000. In glycerol gradients containing molybdate, the 90,000, 110,000, and 75,000 molecular weight peptides co-sediment with the [3H]progesterone peak at 8 S. In high salt gradients lacking molybdate, the [3H]progesterone peak co-sediments with the 110,000 and 75,000 molecular weight peptides at 4 S, while the 90,000 molecular weight peptide sediments at 6-7 S. On photoactivation, the synthetic progestin R5020 binds covalently to the 110,000 and 75,000 molecular weight peptides. Thus, both 8 S forms of progesterone receptor contain 90,000 molecular weight peptides which do not bind progesterone, and each 8 S form contains a separate form of progesterone-binding peptide. When receptor is purified from oviduct minces incubated with [32P]orthophosphate, autoradiography indicates the presence of 32P in the 90,000 and 110,000 molecular weight peptides and in a peptide which appears to be slightly larger than 75,000 and may be a more highly phosphorylated fraction of the 75,000 molecular weight peptide. Thus, three separate peptides have been identified as components of the 8 S form of progesterone receptor, and all three appear to exist as phosphoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1977076531,"It has been suggested that many DNA-binding proteins use an alpha-helix for specific sequence recognition. We have used amino acid sequence homologies to identify the presumptive DNA-recognition helices in two related proteins whose structures are unknown--the repressor and cro protein of bacteriophage 434. The 434 repressor and cro protein each bind to three similar sites in the rightward phage 434 operator, OR, and they make different contacts in each binding site, as revealed by the chemical probe dimethyl sulfate. We substituted the putative recognition alpha-helix of 434 repressor with the putative recognition alpha-helix of 434 cro protein to create a hybrid protein named repressor*. The specific DNA contacts made by repressor* are like those of 434 cro protein."
https://openalex.org/W2039764726,"Intravenous infusion of morphine sulfate in rats for 24 hours produced marked opioid dependence, manifested by a series of well-documented signs appearing after injection of the opiate antagonist naloxone. Treatment of rats with naloxonazine significantly reduced the analgesia associated with the morphine infusions for more than 24 hours. Furthermore, 14 of 16 withdrawal signs observed in naloxonazine-treated rats were virtually identical to those in rats that received morphine alone. These results raise the possibility that different receptor mechanisms mediate morphine analgesia and many of the withdrawal signs associated with morphine dependence."
https://openalex.org/W1597820155,"Delipidated proteins from albumin-free liver and heart cytosol obtained from rats sacrificed at the mid-dark or the mid-light phase of the light cycle were assayed for their palmitate-binding capacity. In both tissues a marked variation of this binding capacity was observed from about 3-4 nmol/mg of protein in the mid-light phase of the cycle to about 7-8 nmol/mg of protein in the mid-dark phase. Sephadex G-75 chromatography of the cytosolic proteins revealed that the palmitate binding could in all cases almost entirely be attributed to proteins of Mr = 12,000-14,000, suggesting that the observed diurnal variations are related to differences in the content of fatty acid-binding protein (FABP). In both rat liver and heart FABP represents about 4 (mid-light) to 8% (mid-dark) of the total soluble proteins. Cholestyramine feeding increased the FABP content of liver cytosol from rats sacrificed at the mid-light phase, but not in those sacrificed at the mid-dark phase, in such a way that the diurnal variation of the FABP content virtually disappeared. The palmitate oxidation capacity and citrate synthase activity also exhibited a concomitant diurnal periodicity in rat liver and, to a lesser extent, in rat heart. The results provide additional evidence for an important role of FABP in cellular fatty acid metabolism in both liver and heart and for the similarity of FABP with sterol carrier protein."
https://openalex.org/W1652063548,"Four polyclonal antisera directed against the insulin receptor were tested for their capability to activate the tyrosine-specific protein kinase associated with the receptor. All four antisera were shown to inhibit insulin binding to the receptor in cultured human lymphoblastoid cells and to stimulate lipogenesis in isolated rat adipocytes. Although two antisera (B-d, B-8) stimulated the activity of the tyrosine kinase of partially purified receptor preparations from rat liver, two other antisera (B-2 and B-10) failed to do so. This failure could not be explained by lack of antibody binding to receptor, by interference with the receptor as a substrate for the kinase, or by blocking of the enzyme's active site. We conclude that these two antireceptor antibodies bind to the receptor but fail to activate the kinase. The simplest interpretation of these observations is that activation of the tyrosine-specific protein kinase might not be an obligatory step in coupling insulin binding to insulin action. However, it is also possible that the mechanism by which polyclonal antireceptor antisera mimic insulin's bioactivity may differ from the mechanism of action of insulin itself."
https://openalex.org/W1562393866,"Treatment of MDCK cells with glucagon results in decreases in glucagon, NaF and prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities, indicating the occurrence of a heterologous desensitization process. The extent of desensitization was time and glucagon concentration dependent. Maximal desensitization (30-50% decrease in stimulation by various effectors) was obtained by 4 h at 100 nM glucagon. Glucagon also induced homologous desensitization since after treatment, the Kact of glucagon was specifically increased. Treatment of cells with 10 microM 8-bromoadenosine 3':5'-monophosphate or 10 microM forskolin resulted in decreased hormonal (glucagon and prostaglandin E1) stimulation without any decrease in the stimulation by nonhormonal effectors (NaF, forskolin, and guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate). The stimulatory regulator (Ns) of the adenylyl cyclase system was analyzed after desensitization with glucagon and no measurable changes in the apparent levels of the alpha s subunits of Ns or the activity of Ns as assessed by reconstitution of the cyc- S49 cell membrane adenylyl cyclase were detected. Levels of the alpha i subunit of the inhibitory regulator (Ni) were monitored by labeling with [32P]NAD and pertussis toxin. Membranes of glucagon-treated cells showed a 2-fold increase in the amount of alpha i labeled. Addition of pure Ns to glucagon-treated MDCK cell membranes restored full stimulation by NaF but did not restore stimulation by prostaglandin E1 or glucagon. It is concluded that glucagon induces heterologous and homologous desensitization of the MDCK cell adenylyl cyclase. The locus of the heterologous desensitization is at the level of the regulatory components. Decreased stimulation is thought to occur due to either an increase in the levels of Ni or due to altered interactions between the subunits of Ni."
https://openalex.org/W1512227349,"The single-stranded DNA-binding proteins from bacteriophage T4, F plasmid, Escherichia coli, and calf thymus can all be covalently cross-linked in vitro to thymine oligonucleotides by irradiating the respective protein-oligonucleotide complexes with ultraviolet light. More extensive studies on the E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) indicate that this reaction is dependent upon both the length of the oligonucleotide and the dose of ultraviolet irradiation. Using anion-exchange and reverse-phase ion-pairing high-performance liquid chromatography we have isolated a specific cross-linked tryptic peptide comprising residues 57-62 of the SSB protein with the sequence valine-valine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine-lysine. Solid-phase sequence analysis of the covalent [32P] p(dT)8-peptide complex indicates that phenylalanine 60 is the site of cross-linking. This amino acid is located within the general region of SSB (residues 1-115) that has previously been shown to contain the DNA-binding site (Williams, K. R., Spicer, E. K., LoPresti, M. B., Guggenheimer, R. A., and Chase, J. W. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3346-3355). The high-performance liquid chromatography purification procedure we have devised to isolate cross-linked peptide-oligonucleotide complexes should be of general applicability and should facilitate future structure/function studies on other nucleic acid-binding proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1573272961,"Rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase exhibits a diurnal rhythm of activity which coincides with a diurnal rhythm of reductase protein and reductase mRNA levels. This diurnal rhythm of reductase activity, polypeptide mass, and mRNA exists in rats fed a normal diet (unsupplemented rat chow) and in rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine plus or minus mevinolin. Levels of reductase protein were determined by 8 M urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Reductase mRNA was measured by in vitro translation or blot hybridization of liver RNA. Functional reductase mRNA levels in rats fed a normal diet were approximately 10-fold higher during the middle of the dark cycle than during the middle of the light cycle. Maximum induction of functional reductase mRNA was observed in rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin. This latter level was 157-fold higher than the level measured at the diurnal low point in rats fed a normal diet. Blot hybridization of liver RNA showed two predominant mRNAs of 4.6 and 4.2 kilobase pairs and a minor species at 6.9 kilobase pairs. These mRNAs exhibited a diurnal rhythm for rats on all three diets and reached peak levels during the 12-h dark period. These data indicate that the diurnal rhythm of reductase mass and activity is closely paralleled by the level of its mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1482095729,"Homologous pairing of single strands with duplex DNA promoted by recA protein occurred without a lag only when the protein was preincubated with ATP and single-stranded DNA. The rate-limiting presynaptic interaction of recA protein and single strands showed a high temperature coefficient: it proceeded 30 times more slowly at 30 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, whereas synapsis showed a normal temperature coefficient. Thus, the presynaptic phase could be separated experimentally from the rest of the reaction by preincubation of single strands with recA protein and ATP at 37 degrees C, followed by a shift to 30 degrees C before double-stranded DNA was added. The presynaptic phase was an order of magnitude more sensitive to inhibition by ADP than was subsequent strand exchange. Presynaptic complexes that were formed at 37 degrees C decayed only slowly at 30 degrees C, but Escherichia coli single strand binding protein caused complexes to form rapidly at 30 degrees C which indicates that single strand binding protein accelerated the rate of formation of complexes. Preincubation synchronized the initial pairing reaction, and further revealed the rapid formation of nascent heteroduplex DNA 250-300 base pairs in length."
https://openalex.org/W1535502996,"F-actin at steady state in the presence of ATP partially depolymerized to a new steady state upon mechanical fragmentation. The increase in critical concentration with the number concentration of filaments has been quantitatively studied. The data can be explained by a model in which the preferred pathway for actin association-dissociation reactions at steady state in the presence of ATP involves binding of G-actin . ATP to filaments, ATP hydrolysis, and dissociation of G-actin . ADP which is then slowly converted to G-actin . ATP. As a consequence of the slow exchange of nucleotide on G-actin, the respective amounts of G-actin . ATP and G-actin . ADP coexisting with F-actin at steady state depend on the filament number concentration. G-actin coexisting with F-actin at zero number concentration of filaments would then consist of G-actin . ATP only, while the critical concentration obtained at infinite number of filaments would be that for G-actin . ADP. Values of 0.35 and 8 microM, respectively, were found for these two extreme critical concentrations for skeletal muscle actin at 20 degrees C, pH 7.8, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM ATP. The same value of 8 microM was directly measured for the critical concentration of G-actin . ADP polymerized in the presence of ADP and absence of ATP, and it was unaffected by fragmentation. These results have important implications for experiments in which critical concentrations are compared under conditions that change the filament number concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2015123504,"Active minichromosomes assembled on injected 5S RNA gene clones are stable in Xenopus oocytes; endogenous 5S DNA specific factor(s) are required for their assembly. When somatic-type and oocyte-type 5S RNA gene clones are coinjected, the somatic genes are assembled into active minichromosomes, while most of the oocyte genes are assembled into inactive ones. The differential 5S RNA gene expression, which mimics that in somatic cells, appears to result from titration of 5S DNA specific factor(s) by the competing somatic 5S DNA, followed by histone mediated assembly of inactive chromatin on the oocyte 5S DNA. Stable minichromosomes are also assembled on a cloned histone H4 gene; again, intragenic DNA rearrangements affect the efficiency of assembly of active chromatin and differential gene expression occurs after coinjection of two or more H4 DNA constructs. We suggest that the H4 DNA molecules also compete for limiting quantities of specific DNA binding factor(s) required for the assembly of active H4 gene chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1955002699,"MCF-7 human breast cancer cells secrete two immunologic types of plasminogen activator, one related to urokinase, the other unrelated. We have now examined whether estrogen stimulation of secreted plasminogen activator activity reflects an increase in one or both types. Examined semiquantitatively by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic zymography, the conditioned media of control cells were seen to contain a major activator band (Mr approximately 54,000) immunologically related to urokinase and a barely discernible doublet (Mr approximately 64,000 and Mr approximately 68,000). Addition of estradiol or, at much higher concentrations, testosterone led to marked enhancement of doublet activity, while the 54-kDa band was invariant. The 64-68-kDa doublet was immunoreactive with antiserum directed against Bowes melanoma tissue plasminogen activator but not with antiurokinase antibodies. Enhancement of doublet activity was correlated with hormone-induced increases in total secreted plasminogen activator activity. Neither progesterone nor dexamethasone increased total activity or the 64-68-kDa zones of lysis. Estradiol and testosterone alterations were blocked by appropriate concentrations of an estrogen antagonist (LY156758), actinomycin D, or cycloheximide. Regulation of MCF-7 cell-secreted tissue plasminogen activators thus appears to be mediated by an estrogen receptor process and to require sustained RNA and protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1512305798,"The distribution of cellular retinol-binding protein was localized in three tissues involved in the transport of vitamin A using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique. In addition, a sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed to quantitate cellular retinol-binding protein in various tissues. In liver, the protein was found in the hepatocytes and in the perisinusoidal fat-storing cells. The columnar epithelial cells of the jejunum and the cells of the proximal tubuli also exhibit high concentrations of cellular retinol-binding protein. Estimations of the content of the protein in various tissues from normal and retinol-deficient rats showed that the retinol status did not affect the tissue levels or the subcellular distribution. The appearance of high amounts of this protein in cells involved in the dietary uptake, storage, mobilization, and resorption of vitamin A suggest that one function of the cellular retinol-binding protein is to act as a vehicle in the intracellular transport of retinol through these organs."
https://openalex.org/W1513184466,"A urokinase-type plasminogen activator secreted by subcultured normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells was purified and compared to urinary urokinase (Mr = 54,000). The enzyme was isolated from serum-free conditioned medium in the presence of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 by p-aminobenzamidine-agarose affinity chromatography, followed by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration, followed by immunoadsorption chromatography on affinity purified specific anti-urokinase IgG-Sepharose CL-4B. This plasminogen activator form was obtained from the culture medium with a yield of about 47% and specific activity of about 93,000 IU/mg of protein, and represented approximately 18% of the total multiple molecular plasminogen activator activity forms present in endothelial cell conditioned medium. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme showed a single band of plasminogen activator activity with an estimated molecular weight of about 54,000 that was completely inhibited by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) as well as a single band of radioactivity with similar molecular weight for both the isolated L-[4,5-3H]leucine and [3H]DFP-labeled enzyme. The radiolabeled protein focused as a single major band with a pI value of pH 8.5. The endothelial cell activator and urokinase appeared to be identical in terms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, location of the [3H]DFP-labeled active site in the Mr = 33,000 heavy chain and [3H]DFP-labeled active site tryptic peptide, and two-dimensional 125I-labeled tryptic peptide maps. In quenching experiments of the fibrinolytic activities using affinity purified specific anti-urokinase IgG the endothelial cell-derived activator and urokinase appeared to be immunochemically identical, but unrelated to tissue plasminogen activator. These results indicate that the Mr = 54,000 urokinase-type plasminogen activator from cultured normal human endothelial cells is similar to, or identical with, Mr = 54,000 urinary urokinase."

It had no comparable effect on urokinase. IC50 values of 1.1 X 10(-7) M for tissue plasminogen activator and 6.9 X 10(-10) M for trypsin were determined by titration. When coupled to agarose, the Erythrina inhibitor provided an effective reagent for affinity purification of tissue plasminogen activator from melanoma cell-conditioned tissue culture medium. Using this as a single-step procedure, 270-fold purified enzyme was reproducibly obtained with yields of 90% or greater. Both one- and two-chain forms of tissue plasminogen activator were purified.

The alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase in LEC12 cell extracts binds to GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose and is unaffected by 3 mM N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast, the alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase activity in LEC11 cells does not bind readily to GDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose and is completely inhibited by 1 mM N-ethylmaleimide. The LEC11 and LEC12 alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferases also differ in the degree to which they are stimulated by divalent cations as well as in their abilities to fucosylate a variety of exogenous substrates. Of particular interest is the finding that the LEC11 alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase adds fucose to certain sialylated glycoproteins, whereas the LEC12 enzyme is essentially unable to fucosylate these acceptors, although it is very active with their desialylated derivatives. The combined evidence shows that the LEC11 and LEC12 alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase enzymes are different molecules and presumably, therefore, the products of distinct genes. In addition, neither of the enzymes appears identical to any of the previously described alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase activities from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W1486761823,"A soluble isoelectric variant of the 150,000-dalton neurofilament protein was isolated from bovine brain by treating a partially purified filament preparation with a low-ionic-strength high-pH buffer. The protein (S150) had similar peptide maps to the neurofilament component of the same molecular weight (NF150) and was recognized by a polyclonal antibody made against the NF150 polypeptide. However, only half the anti-NF150 activity could be removed with the S150 protein. In addition, the S150 protein had a higher isoelectric point than the NF150 protein. Phosphate analysis indicated that the S150 protein was considerably lessened in phosphate content, which could account for the higher isoelectric point of the protein. It appears, therefore, that the S150 protein may be a precursor of NF150 or the result of phosphatase activity during the isolation procedure. Assembly studies showed that the S150 protein, unlike the NF150 protein, could not assemble with the 70-kDa neurofilament protein, indicating that the phosphate groups which were removed are important in the association of this protein to the neurofilament. When filaments containing all three triplet neurofilament polypeptides or those composed of the 70- and 150-kDa neurofilament proteins were subjected to acid phosphatase, a soluble fraction was obtained, which contained isoelectric variants with higher pI values than the NF150 polypeptide. Only unmodified NF150 protein was found in the insoluble fraction. These results support the argument that removal of phosphate groups results in the dissociation of this protein from the filament."
https://openalex.org/W1525823828,"The major species of tyrosine protein kinase of rat liver, has been purified to near homogeneity from liver cytosol. When the kinase was incubated with MnCl2 and [gamma-32P]ATP, two phosphoproteins with molecular masses of 72 and 75 kilodaltons were observed. The purified kinase, called p75 kinase, phosphorylates [Val5]angiotensin II, casein, vinculin, and a 34-kilodalton protein isolated from chicken embryo fibroblasts. However, it does not phosphorylate histones or IgG from Rous sarcoma virus tumor-bearing rabbits. The kinase does not contain any of the major antigenic determinants found in retroviral tyrosine protein kinases or in epidermal growth factor-receptor kinase. p75 kinase activity, as well as viral tyrosine protein kinase activity, is stimulated by heparin. Phosphorylation of angiotensin is also stimulated by high ionic strength. In contrast, casein phosphorylation by the kinase appeared to be inhibited by high salt. Kinetic properties of p75 kinase have been determined and have revealed some striking differences from those of most other tyrosine protein kinases. For instance, p75 kinase exhibits rather stringent dependence for its activity on ATP as phosphoryl donor and Mn2+ as divalent cation."
https://openalex.org/W1661157814,"The amino acid sequences of the acidic and basic components of the A2B1a subunit of glycinin, the major seed reserve protein of the soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), were determined. They contain 278 and 180 amino acids, respectively, and have molecular weights of 31,600 +/- 100 and 19,900 +/- 100. The molecular weight of the acidic component is considerably less than that estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis (37,000). Sequence heterogeneity was detected at several positions scattered throughout the primary structures of both components, indicating that the preparation sequenced was composed of several nearly identical polypeptides. These data, in conjunction with a recently determined nucleotide sequence of the 3'-terminal two-thirds of the analogous glycinin subunit gene, illustrate the complexity of the gene family responsible for synthesis of glycinin subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1491371169,"The sea urchin egg contains one or more tyrosine-specific protein kinase(s) which are active during the response of the egg to sperm fusion. Fertilization results in an 8-fold increase in the relative incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate into phosphotyrosine as compared to phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Under defined in vitro conditions, plasma membranes from fertilized eggs incorporated 5-10-fold more phosphate into tyrosine than plasma membranes from unfertilized eggs. Analysis of the phosphorylated plasma membrane proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that at least four proteins were more actively phosphorylated in plasma membranes from fertilized eggs. Of these, a closely spaced doublet of approximately 120 kDa was found to contain phosphotyrosine. The properties of the egg tyrosine-specific kinase were studied using an artificial peptide substrate. The enzyme is membrane-bound and is enriched 8-fold in the egg plasma membrane. Enzyme activity in egg homogenates and plasma membranes increased 2- and 4-fold, respectively, as early as 20 min, post-insemination. These results suggest that the fertilization-dependent increase in tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity may play a role in the onset of embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W1551788119,"Under controlled levels of fragmentation by sonication in the presence of ATP, actin filaments reached different length distributions corresponding to different steady states of polymerization. When the sonication was interrupted, a spontaneous decrease in the number of filaments and corresponding increase in length was observed. The kinetics of the process of length redistribution subsequent to fragmentation was studied for the simpler case of F-actin filaments at equilibrium in the presence of ADP. Analysis of the data shows that a diffusion-like random walk mechanism of length redistribution quantitatively accounts for the observations much better than the previously proposed end-to-end reannealing of filaments. The involvement of this process in the kinetics of actin polymerization and in establishing the length distribution at steady state is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1536037468,"Two types of embryonic hemoglobins (Hb) containing zeta chains have been identified in the blood of several neonates of Chinese origin with homozygous alpha-thalassemia. In addition to Hb Portland I (zeta 2 gamma 2) which was previously reported, another embryonic hemoglobin has been detected and found to contain zeta chains and beta chains. It is being designated Hb Portland II and has the formula (zeta 2 beta 2). It has a mobility slightly slower than that of Hb A on starch gel electrophoresis at pH 8.6 and has been found in the hemolysates of blood of some but not all hydropic infants. Another component with a mobility faster than that of Hb A2 on starch gel has been isolated from the blood of some hydropic neonates. This latter component is postulated to be zeta 2 delta 2. The occurrence of Hb Portland I and Hb Portland II in these hydropic neonates is consistent with the hypothesis that, in the absence of normal alpha chain production, zeta chains are continued to be produced at later states of development than normal and form tetramers with each of the beta-like globin chains. Because Hb Portland II has not been found in blood from all hydropic neonates, we postulate that the presence of this hemoglobin in these fetuses may be correlated with the gestational age of the fetus at the time of birth."
https://openalex.org/W1596658119,"Deuterium isotope effects on the kinetic parameters for the hydroperoxide-supported N-demethylation of N,N-dimethylaniline catalyzed by chloroperoxidase and horseradish peroxidase were determined using N,N-di-(trideuteromethyl)aniline. The isotope effect on the Vmax for the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed demethylation reaction supported by ethyl hydroperoxide was 1.42 +/- 0.31. The isotope effects on the Vmax for the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed reaction supported by ethyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide were 1.99 +/- 0.39 and 4.09 +/- 0.27, respectively. Isotope effects ranging from 1.76 to 5.10 were observed on the Vmax/Km for the hydroperoxide substrate (i.e. the second order rate constant for the reaction of the hydroperoxide with the peroxidase to form compound I) in both enzyme systems when the N-methyl groups of N,N-dimethylaniline were deuterated. These results are not predicted by the simple ping-pong kinetic model for peroxidase-catalyzed N-demethylation reactions. The data are most simply explained by a mechanism involving the transfer of deuterium (or hydrogen) from N,N-dimethylaniline to the enzyme during catalysis. The deuterium must subsequently be displaced from the enzyme by the hydroperoxide, causing the observed isotope effects."
https://openalex.org/W1562171873,"An established cell line (TM-4) derived from murine Sertoli cells, the major supportive cell type of the testes, secretes a protein that binds retinol when grown in serum-free chemically defined medium. The protein that binds retinol is trypsin-sensitive and has an apparent Kd for retinol of 54 nM. Cholesterol, retinyl acetate, or UV-irradiated retinol at levels 100-fold in excess of retinol are poor competitors of [3H]retinol binding. Retinoic acid at a 100-fold molar excess inhibited [3H]retinol binding by 71%. In contrast, excess unlabeled retinol completely inhibits [3H]retinol binding. More than 80% of the total retinol-binding activity in confluent cultures is found in the culture medium. Prior to incubation with retinol, the protein that binds retinol has an apparent Mr of less than 150,000 by column chromatography; however, after incubation with retinol the protein that binds retinol exhibits an apparent Mr of 2 X 10(6) or greater and a sedimentation coefficient greater than 4 S. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that the major iodinatable component of the aggregated protein that binds retinol has an apparent Mr of 70,000. The secreted protein that binds retinol is not immunologically cross-reactive with either serum or cellular retinol-binding protein or transferrin. These findings suggest that Sertoli cells may secrete a protein that binds retinol. Such a protein could be involved in the transport of retinol either to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules or to the developing germ cells themselves."
https://openalex.org/W1597372220,"Forskolin is an activator of adenylate cyclase in many cell types. In order to determine the mechanism of forskolin's action and to determine if this mechanism is shared by hormones and other agonists of the adenylate cyclase system, we isolated and partially characterized several spontaneous, forskolin-resistant mutants from the Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumor cell line. Forskolin increased adenylate cyclase activity in Y1 cell homogenates approximately 30-fold. By virtue of its effect on cAMP accumulation, forskolin (10 microM) also inhibited the growth of Y1 cells in monolayer culture. Using forskolin as a selective agent, spontaneous mutants capable of growth in the presence of 10 microM forskolin were isolated from the Y1 cell line at a frequency of 1-2/10(6) cells. In these mutants, resistance was stable, resulting from a defect in cAMP accumulation rather than cAMP action, and was associated with a reduced ability of forskolin to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in cell homogenates. Whereas corticotropin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity over 35-fold in cell homogenates from the Y1 parent, ACTH had only marginal effects on the enzyme's activity in the mutant clones. Fluoride-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity seemed unimpaired. These results suggest that the resistance to forskolin resulted from a mutation in the adenylate cyclase system, not in the catalytic subunit, but at a locus related to the ACTH."

The crystals differ in their morphologies, but are both in space group P212121 and have similar unit cell sizes (a = 45.9, b = 53.3, c = 72.0 A and a = 45.7, b = 48.7, and c = 76.5 A).

https://openalex.org/W1535779481,"[14,15-3H] Dihydroforskolin has been used as a tracer in the study of forskolin binding to adipocyte plasma membrane and the subsequent activation of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) of this membrane. The specific binding of radioactivity to the membrane was rapid, temperature-dependent, saturable, and readily reversible. The equilibrium dissociation reaction constant (KD) for the binding was 13 microM, with a maximum binding (Bmax) of 61 pmol of forskolin per mg of membrane protein. The Hill coefficient was 1.0. The bound [14,15-3H] dihydroforskolin was displaced by forskolin with rate constants of 0.07 X 10(6) M-1 min-1 and 1.2 min-1 for the association and dissociation reactions, respectively (30 degrees C). The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was approximately the same as the concentration that produced half-maximum activation (EC50) of the adenylate cyclase of rat adipocyte plasma membrane. There was a linear correlation between forskolin binding and adenylate cyclase activation. The results are consistent with the concept of a single class of binding site which binds forskolin. [14,15-3H] Dihydroforskolin appears to be a potentially useful tracer in the study of the mechanism of activation of the catalytic unit of adipocyte adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1484102676,"Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons prepared from thrombin-activated platelets were found to potentiate the activation of prothrombin (prothrombinase activity). Cytoskeletons prepared from red cells or lymphoblasts contained no prothrombinase activity. The platelet prothrombinase activity was dependent on cytoskeletal-associated Factor Va, and exogenously added Factor Xa and prothrombin. Cytoskeletons contained 38% of the total platelet prothrombinase activity. Both platelets and cytoskeletons displayed half-maximal activities at similar prothrombin concentrations. The role of lipids in the cytoskeletal prothrombinase activity was investigated. Cytoskeletons were found to contain 3.8% of the total platelet phospholipids, consisting of the following lipids expressed as percentage of total present in platelets: 6.0% sphingomyelin, 3.8% phosphatidylcholine, 2.9% phosphatidyl-ethanolamine, 4.4% phosphatidylinositol, and 2.2% phosphatidylserine. The cytoskeletal prothrombinase activity and the lipid phosphorus content of cytoskeletons decreased after treatment of cytoskeletons with various doses of phospholipase C. Incubation of cytoskeletons with the highest concentrations tested (10 micrograms/ml) resulted in a 72% loss of phosphatidylserine and 84% loss of cytoskeletal prothrombinase activity. Cytoskeletal prothrombinase activity destroyed by phospholipase C treatment could be restored to control levels by treatment of hydrolyzed cytoskeletons with total cytoskeletal lipid or mixtures of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (25:75% by weight). These results suggest that the cytoskeletal prothrombinase complex in addition to containing Factor Va, as has been previously shown (15), contains a lipid cofactor activity consisting in part of phosphatidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W1615414929,"The amino acid sequence of the A3 subunit, an acidic subunit of the glycinin seed storage protein of the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill), has been determined by sequence analysis of the peptides obtained by cyanogen bromide cleavage followed by enzymatic digestion and partial acid hydrolysis. The A3 subunit is composed of 410 amino acids (Mr approximately 46,000). It has been confirmed that there are conserved, repeated domains within the subunit. A comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence of the A4 subunit with the sequence of the A3 subunit reveals that a sequence highly homologous to the NH2-terminal sequence of the A4 subunit exists in internal regions of the A3 subunit. This suggests that the genes coding for the acidic subunits of glycinin are strongly related, and have the same evolutionary origin."
