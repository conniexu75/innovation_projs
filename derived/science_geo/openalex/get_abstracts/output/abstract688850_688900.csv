https://openalex.org/W4213346436,"If perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are to be commercialized, they must achieve long-term stability, which is usually assessed with accelerated degradation tests. One of the persistent obstacles for PSCs has been successfully passing the damp-heat test (85°C and 85% relative humidity), which is the standard for verifying the stability of commercial photovoltaic (PV) modules. We fabricated damp heat-stable PSCs by tailoring the dimensional fragments of two-dimensional perovskite layers formed at room temperature with oleylammonium iodide molecules; these layers passivate the perovskite surface at the electron-selective contact. The resulting inverted PSCs deliver a 24.3% PCE and retain >95% of their initial value after >1000 hours at damp-heat test conditions, thereby meeting one of the critical industrial stability standards for PV modules."
https://openalex.org/W4213197835,"High-energy density lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for energy storage applications but suffer from uncontrollable electrolyte degradation and the consequently formed unstable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI). In this study, we designed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with high-density and long-range-ordered polar carboxyl groups linked to an aluminum oxide-coated separator to provide strong dipole moments, thus offering excess electrons to accelerate the degradation dynamics of carbon-fluorine bond cleavage in Li bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide. Hence, an SEI with enriched lithium fluoride (LiF) nanocrystals is generated, facilitating rapid Li+ transfer and suppressing dendritic Li growth. In particular, the SAMs endow the full cells with substantially enhanced cyclability under high cathode loading, limited Li excess, and lean electrolyte conditions. As such, our work extends the long-established SAMs technology into a platform to control electrolyte degradation and SEI formation toward LMBs with ultralong life spans."

This might be because humans are exposed to EDC mixtures, whereas chemical regulation is based on a risk assessment of individual compounds. Here, we developed a mixture-centered risk assessment strategy that integrates epidemiological and experimental evidence. We identified that exposure to an EDC mixture in early pregnancy is associated with language delay in offspring. At human-relevant concentrations, this mixture disrupted hormone-regulated and disease-relevant regulatory networks in human brain organoids and in the model organisms Xenopus leavis and Danio rerio, as well as behavioral responses. Reinterrogating epidemiological data, we found that up to 54% of the children had prenatal exposures above experimentally derived levels of concern, reaching, for the upper decile compared with the lowest decile of exposure, a 3.3 times higher risk of language delay."
https://openalex.org/W4212967995,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the central nervous system (CNS) from harmful blood-borne factors. Although BBB dysfunction is a hallmark of several neurological disorders, therapies to restore BBB function are lacking. An attractive strategy is to repurpose developmental BBB regulators, such as Wnt7a, into BBB-protective agents. However, safe therapeutic use of Wnt ligands is complicated by their pleiotropic Frizzled signaling activities. Taking advantage of the Wnt7a/b-specific Gpr124/Reck co-receptor complex, we genetically engineered Wnt7a ligands into BBB-specific Wnt activators. In a “hit-and-run” adeno-associated virus–assisted CNS gene delivery setting, these new Gpr124/Reck-specific agonists protected BBB function, thereby mitigating glioblastoma expansion and ischemic stroke infarction. This work reveals that the signaling specificity of Wnt ligands is adjustable and defines a modality to treat CNS disorders by normalizing the BBB."

In this work, we used cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to reveal structures of native nebulin bound to thin filaments within intact sarcomeres. This in situ reconstruction provided high-resolution details of the interaction between nebulin and actin, demonstrating the stabilizing role of nebulin. Myosin bound to the thin filaments exhibited different conformations of the neck domain, highlighting its inherent structural variability in muscle. Unexpectedly, nebulin did not interact with myosin or tropomyosin, but it did interact with a troponin T linker through two potential binding motifs on nebulin, explaining its regulatory role. Our structures support the role of nebulin as a thin filament ""molecular ruler"" and provide a molecular basis for studying nemaline myopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4213164768,"Proposed hydropower dams at more than 350 sites throughout the Amazon require strategic evaluation of trade-offs between the numerous ecosystem services provided by Earth's largest and most biodiverse river basin. These services are spatially variable, hence collective impacts of newly built dams depend strongly on their configuration. We use multiobjective optimization to identify portfolios of sites that simultaneously minimize impacts on river flow, river connectivity, sediment transport, fish diversity, and greenhouse gas emissions while achieving energy production goals. We find that uncoordinated, dam-by-dam hydropower expansion has resulted in forgone ecosystem service benefits. Minimizing further damage from hydropower development requires considering diverse environmental impacts across the entire basin, as well as cooperation among Amazonian nations. Our findings offer a transferable model for the evaluation of hydropower expansion in transboundary basins."
https://openalex.org/W4213046832,"Lead poisoning occurs worldwide in populations of predatory birds, but exposure rates and population impacts are known only from regional studies. We evaluated the lead exposure of 1210 bald and golden eagles from 38 US states across North America, including 620 live eagles. We detected unexpectedly high frequencies of lead poisoning of eagles, both chronic (46 to 47% of bald and golden eagles, as measured in bone) and acute (27 to 33% of bald eagles and 7 to 35% of golden eagles, as measured in liver, blood, and feathers). Frequency of lead poisoning was influenced by age and, for bald eagles, by region and season. Continent-wide demographic modeling suggests that poisoning at this level suppresses population growth rates for bald eagles by 3.8% (95% confidence interval: 2.5%, 5.4%) and for golden eagles by 0.8% (0.7%, 0.9%). Lead poisoning is an underappreciated but important constraint on continent-wide populations of these iconic protected species."
https://openalex.org/W4213166027,"Many factors play a role in outcomes of an emerging highly contagious disease such as COVID-19. Identification and better understanding of these factors are critical in planning and implementation of effective response strategies during such public health crises. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of factors related to social distancing, human mobility, enforcement strategies, hospital capacity, and testing capacity on COVID-19 outcomes within counties located in District of Columbia as well as the states of Maryland and Virginia. Longitudinal data have been used in the analysis to model county-level COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. These data include big location-based service data, which were collected from anonymized mobile devices and characterize various social distancing and human mobility measures within the study area during the pandemic. The results provide empirical evidence that lower rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality are linked with increased levels of social distancing and reduced levels of travel-particularly by public transit modes. Other preventive strategies and polices also prove to be influential in COVID-19 outcomes. Most notably, lower COVID-19 infection and mortality rates are linked with stricter enforcement policies and more severe penalties for violating stay-at-home orders. Further, policies that allow gradual relaxation of social distancing measures and travel restrictions as well as those requiring usage of a face mask are related to lower rates of COVID-19 infections and deaths. Additionally, increased access to ventilators and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, which represent hospital capacity, are linked with lower COVID-19 mortality rates. On the other hand, gaps in testing capacity are related to higher rates of COVID-19 infection. The results also provide empirical evidence for reports suggesting that certain minority groups such as African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4213033613,"Lizard tail autotomy is an antipredator strategy consisting of sturdy attachment at regular times but quick detachment during need. We propose a biomimetic fracture model of lizard tail autotomy using multiscale hierarchical structures. The structures consist of uniformly distributed micropillars with nanoporous tops, which recapitulate the high-density mushroom-shaped microstructures found on the lizard tail's muscle fracture plane. The biomimetic experiments showed adhesion enhancement when combining nanoporous interfacial surfaces with flexible micropillars in tensile and peel modes. The fracture modeling identified micro- and nanostructure-based toughening mechanisms as the critical factor. Under wet conditions, capillarity-assisted energy dissipation pertaining to liquid-filled microgaps and nanopores further increased the adhesion performance. This research presents insights on lizard tail autotomy and provides new biomimetic ideas to solve adhesion problems."
https://openalex.org/W4213267246,"Antibiotics dispensing without a prescription is an irrational practice and can increase the risk of antibiotic resistance, which is a significant public health concern around the globe. This study was aimed to determine the extent to which antibiotics are supplied without prescription in the community pharmacies (CPs) at Hazara Division from November 2020 to February 2021. The simulated client method (SCM) was used, and the data were gathered, recorded, and analyzed through different statistical methods with descriptive and inferential techniques. The antibiotic dispensing was observed in CPs (90.5%), the most dispensed antibiotics were azithromycin (29.4%) and ciprofloxacin (46.5%) respectively. Furthermore, visited medical stores/ drug outlets, 9.5% of the visited stores denied dispensing of antibiotics because they preferred a referral to visit physicians (23. 9%) and (12.8%) did not had the antibiotics at the time of visits. Antibiotics were more obtainable in retail medical stores (AOR = 8.6, 95 percent Cl: 3.0-24.7; p = 0.001) than in pharmacies. In rural areas antibiotics dispensing was more (p = 0.004) as compared to urban areas. Staff members also had asked about patient's (17.7%) symptoms and drug allergies (12.3% and 3.9%), and (1.5%) they consoled them about their medications. The findings of this study indicate that nonprescription antibiotic sales are very common, despite national rules prohibiting this activity. When the simulated Client requested for any medication to relieve his or her discomfort, many antibiotics were given out without a prescription. Pharmacies/medical stores in Hazara Division selling antibiotics without a prescription are worrying and need immediate action by regulators."
https://openalex.org/W4213276779,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is two to five times more prevalent in diabetic patients and is the leading cause of death. Therefore, identification of novel therapeutic strategies that reduce the risk of CVD is a research priority. Clinical trials showed that reduction in the relative risk of heart failure by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are partly beyond their glucose lowering effects, however, the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here we investigated the role of SGLT2i dapagliflozin (DAPA) in the prevention of diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications.Type 1 diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (65 mg/bwkg, ip.) in adult, male Wistar rats. Following the onset of diabetes rats were treated for six weeks with DAPA (1 mg/bwkg/day, po.).DAPA decreased blood glucose levels (D: 37±2.7 vs. D+DAPA: 18±5.6 mmol/L; p<0.05) and prevented metabolic decline. Aortic intima-media thickening was mitigated by DAPA. DAPA abolished cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial damage. Cardiac inflammation and fibrosis were also moderated after DAPA treatment.These data support the preventive and protective role of SGLT2i in diabetes-associated cardiovascular disease. SGLT2i may provide novel therapeutic strategy to hinder the development of cardiovascular diseases in type 1 diabetes, thereby improve the outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4213217963,"Clusters of COPD patients have been reported in order to individualize the treatment program. Neither co-morbidity clusters, nor integrated respiratory physiomics clusters contributed to a better prediction of outcomes. Based on a thoroughly assessed set of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary traits at the start of a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program, we recently described seven clusters of COPD patients. The aims of this study are to confirm multidimensional differential response and to assess the potential of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary traits-based clusters to predict this multidimensional response to PR pulmonary in COPD patients.Outcomes of a 40-session PR program for COPD patients, referred by a chest physician, were evaluated based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), cycle endurance time, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure performance and satisfaction scores, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety and depression scores, MRC dyspnea grade and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire. The aforementioned response indicators were used to calculate the overall multidimensional response and patients were grouped in very good, good, moderate and poor responders. In the same way, responses to pulmonary rehabilitation were compared based on seven previously identified pulmonary and extra-pulmonary traits-based clusters.Of the whole sample, drop out was 19% and 419 patients (55.4% males, age: 64.3 ± 8.8, FEV1% of predicted: 48.9 ± 20) completed the pulmonary rehabilitation program. Very good responders had significantly worse baseline characteristics with a higher burden of disease, a higher proportion of rollator-users, higher body mass index (BMI), more limitations of activities in daily life, emotional dysfunction, higher symptoms of dyspnea and worse quality of life. Of the seven pre-identified clusters, 'the overall best functioning cluster' and 'the low disease burden cluster' both including the best 6MWD, the lowest dyspnea score and the overall best health status, demonstrated attenuated outcomes, while in 'the cluster of disabled patients', 76% of the patients improved health status with at least 2 times MCID. This 'cluster of disabled patients' as well as 'the multimorbid cluster', 'the emotionally dysfunctioning cluster', 'the overall worst-functioning cluster' and 'the physically dysfunctioning cluster' all demonstrated improvements in performance and satisfaction for occupational activities (more than 65% of patients improved with > 1MCID), emotional functioning (more than 50% of patients improved with > 1 MCID) and overall health status (more than 58%).The current study confirms the differential response to pulmonary rehabilitation based on multidimensional response profiling. Cluster analysis of baseline traits illustrates that non-linear, clinically important differences can be achieved in the most functionally and emotionally impaired clusters and that 'the overall best functional cluster' as well as 'the low disease burden cluster' had an attenuated outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2989789384,"There is limited empirical evidence in Ethiopia on the determinants of treatment outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) who were enrolled to second-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Thus, this study investigated the determinants of treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB at referral hospitals in Ethiopia.This study was underpinned by a cross-sectional quantitative research design that guided both data collection and analysis. Data is collected using structured questionnaire and data analyses was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Multi-variable logistic regression was used to control for confounders in determining the association between treatment outcomes of patients with MDR-TB and selected predictor variables, such as co-morbidity with MDR-TB and body mass index.From the total of 136 patients with MDR-TB included in this study, 31% had some co-morbidity with MDR-TB at baseline, and 64% of the patients had a body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2. At 24 months after commencing treatment, 76 (69%), n = 110), of the patients had successfully completed treatment, while 30 (27%) died of the disease. The odds of death was significantly higher among patients with low body mass index (AOR = 2.734, 95% CI: 1.01-7.395; P<0.048) and those with some co-morbidity at baseline (AOR = 4.260, 95%CI: 1.607-11.29; p<0.004).The higher proportion of mortality among patients treated for MDR-TB at Adama and Nekemte Hospitals, central Ethiopia, is attributable to co-morbidities with MDR-TB, including HIV/AIDS and malnutrition. Improving socio-economic and nutritional support and provision of integrated care for MDR-TB and HIV/AIDS is recommended to mitigate the higher level of death among patients treated for MDR-TB."
https://openalex.org/W4213062543,"The study of ancient cultures is hindered by the incomplete survival of material artifacts, so we commonly underestimate the diversity of cultural production in historic societies. To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages' stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities. These analyses call for a wider application of these methods across the heritage sciences."
https://openalex.org/W4212963877,"Introduction/aims Patients with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) may experience paresthesia, dysesthesia, and pain. We aimed to characterize the predictors, symptoms, somatosensory profile, neuropathy severity, and impact of painful DPN and dysesthetic DPN. Methods This study was a cross-sectional study of type 2 diabetes patients with confirmed DPN, diagnosed using widely accepted methods including a clinical examination, skin biopsy, and nerve conduction studies. Findings Of 126 patients with confirmed DPN, 52 had DPN without pain or dysesthesia, 21 had dysesthetic DPN, and 53 painful DPN. Patients with painful DPN were less physically active and suffered from more pain elsewhere than in the feet compared to patients with DPN without pain. Patients with painful DPN had the largest loss of small and large sensory fiber function, and there was a gradient of larger spatial distribution of sensory loss from DPN without dysesthesia/pain to dysesthetic DPN and to painful DPN. This could indicate that patients with dysesthesia had more severe neuropathy than patients without dysesthesia but less than patients with painful DPN. Patients with dysesthetic and painful DPN had higher symptom scores for depression and fatigue than those without dysesthesia/pain with no difference between dysesthetic and painful DPN. Conclusions There was a gradient of increasing sensory loss from DPN without dysesthesia/pain to dysesthetic DPN and to painful DPN. Pain and dysesthesia are common in DPN and both interfere with daily life. It is therefore important to consider dysesthesia when diagnosing and treating patients with neuropathy."

The study aim was to evaluate the interaction of health insurance status and race with treatment and survival in metastatic CRC.Patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC within NCDB from 2006-2016 were included. Primary outcomes included receipt of chemotherapy and 3-year all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression (MVR) including a two-way interaction term of race and insurance were performed to evaluate the differential association of race and insurance with receipt of chemotherapy and mortality, respectively.128,031 patients were identified; 70.6% White, 14.4% Black, 5.7% Hispanic, and 9.3% Other race. Chemotherapy use was higher among White compared to Black patients. 3-year mortality rate was higher for Blacks and lower for Hispanics, in comparison with White patients. By MVR, Black patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy. When stratified by insurance status, Black patients with private and Medicare insurance were less likely to receive chemotherapy than White patients. All-cause mortality was higher in Black patients and lower in Hispanic patients, and these differences persisted after controlling for insurance and receipt of chemotherapy.Black patients and uninsured or under-insured patients with metastatic CRC are less likely to receive chemotherapy and have increased mortality. The effect of health insurance among Blacks and Whites differs, however, and improving insurance alone does not appear to fully mitigate racial disparities in treatment and outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4212775390,"Occupational therapists in Canada play a central role in wheelchair service provision. Inadequate entry-to-practice professional education has been identified as a major concern in the delivery of wheelchair related services. The goal of this study was to describe the current education provided in Canadian occupational therapy programs and to map this content against the recommended WHO 8-step wheelchair service provision process. The study used a descriptive cross-sectional online survey design. Educators were recruited from accredited occupational therapy programs in Canada. Participants completed a short sociodemographic questionnaire and a survey with 97 closed- and open-ended questions regarding the wheelchair service provision education provided in their curriculum. Survey data was then mapped according to the WHO 8-step wheelchair service provision process. Twenty-nine educators from all Canadian occupational therapy programs (n = 14) were enrolled. Most participants (55.2%) were full-time faculty members that had been teaching in occupational therapy programs for an average time of 10.9 years. All programs covered at least 4 of the WHO recommended steps, but only 5 programs covered all steps. Assessment and Prescription steps were covered in every program while the Referral &amp; Appointment , Funding &amp; Ordering , Fitting and User Training steps were covered in most programs. The pedagogic approach, the amount of time dedicated to wheelchair-related content, and the type of evaluation used varied greatly between programs. This study is the first to provide a detailed description of wheelchair service provision education across all Canadian occupational therapy programs according to the WHO 8 steps and provides a foundation for collaborative efforts to promote best practice in entry-to-practice professional education."
https://openalex.org/W4212809828,"Deletions frequently occur in the six accessory genes of SARS-CoV-2, but most genomes with deletions are sporadic and have limited spreading capability. Here, we analyze deletions in the ORF7a of the N.7 lineage, a unique Uruguayan clade from the Brazilian B.1.1.33 lineage. Thirteen samples collected during the early SARS-CoV-2 wave in Uruguay had deletions in the ORF7a. Complete genomes were obtained by Illumina next-generation sequencing, and deletions were confirmed by Sanger sequencing and capillary electrophoresis. The N.7 lineage includes several individuals with a 12-nucleotide deletion that removes four amino acids of the ORF7a. Notably, four individuals underwent an additional 68-nucleotide novel deletion that locates 44 nucleotides downstream in the terminal region of the same ORF7a. The simultaneous occurrence of the 12 and 68-nucleotide deletions fuses the ORF7a and ORF7b, two contiguous accessory genes that encode transmembrane proteins with immune-modulation activity. The fused ORF retains the signal peptide and the complete Ig-like fold of the 7a protein and the transmembrane domain of the 7b protein, suggesting that the fused protein plays similar functions to original proteins in a single format. Our findings evidence the remarkable dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility that single and consecutive deletions occur in accessory genes and promote changes in the genomic organization that help the virus explore genetic variations and select for new, higher fit changes."

In our research PLS software is used for the analysis of hypotheses. A questionnaire was delivered to a sample of 521 citizens, representing the spectrum of the population, and the statistical study of the responses yielded results on citizen satisfaction and loyalty. Our research includes the study of moderating effects on the causal ratio of perceived value and satisfaction in territorial planning and viability, the perceived quality in the provision of municipal services and the perceived quality in the citizen experience in the environmental management of the territory on the value relationship perceived by the citizen and general satisfaction. A second objective of the study is to see if there are significant differences in the hypotheses raised by gender by performing a multigroup analysis. This difference has been appreciated in two of the hypotheses. The study shows that the policies exercised by the territorial managers of the different areas have a significant influence on the value perceived by citizens, satisfaction and loyalty, which shape their general well-being. Areas for improvement in territorial policies and municipal services such as citizen security, air quality, public lighting and sports services have been identified. Knowing these shortcomings allows politicians to focus their efforts on improving the quality of life in cities."
https://openalex.org/W4213130991,"Implementing countrywide lockdown measures in India, from March 2020 to May 2020 was a major step to deal with the COVID -19 pandemic crisis. The decision of country lockdown adversely affected the urban migrant population, and a large section of them was compelled to move out of the urban areas to their native places. The reverse migration garnered widespread media attention and coverage in electronic as well as print media. The present study focuses on the coverage of the issue by print media using descriptive natural language text mining. The study uses topic modelling, clustering, and sentiment analysis to examine the articles on migration issues during the lockdown period published in two leading English newspapers in India- The Times of India and The Hindu. The sentiment analysis results indicate that the majority of articles have neutral sentiment while very few articles show high negative or positive polarity. Descriptive topic modelling results show that transport, food security, special services, and employment with migration and migrants are the majorly covered topics after employing Bag of Words and TF-IDF models. Clustering is performed to group the article titles based on similar traits using agglomerative hierarchical clustering."
https://openalex.org/W4213274468,"Since 2012, the citizen science project 'Mückenatlas' has been supplementing the German mosquito monitoring programme with over 28,000 submissions of physical insect samples. As the factors triggering people to catch mosquitoes for science are still unknown, we analysed the influence of mass media reports on mosquito submission numbers. Based on a theoretical framework of how mass media affect citizen responsiveness, we identified five possible influencing factors related to citizen science: (i) project awareness and knowledge, (ii) attention (economy), (iii) individual characteristics of citizen scientists and targeted communication, (iv) spatial differences and varying affectedness, and (v) media landscape. Hypotheses based on these influencing factors were quantitatively and qualitatively tested with two datasets: clipping data of mass media reports (online, television, radio and print) referring to or focussing on the 'Mückenatlas', and corresponding data of 'Mückenatlas' submissions between 2014 and 2017. In general, the number of media reports positively affected the number of mosquito submissions on a temporal and spatial scale, i.e. many media reports provoke many mosquito submissions. We found that an already heightened public and media awareness of mosquito-relevant topics combined with a direct call-to-action in a media report title led to a maximum participation. Differences on federal state level, however, suggest that factors additional to quantitative media coverage trigger participation in the 'Mückenatlas', in particular the mosquito affectedness of the resident population. Lastly, media types appear to differ in their effects on the number of submissions. Our results show under which circumstances the media presence of the 'Mückenatlas' is most effective in activating people to submit mosquito samples, and thus provide advice for designing communication strategies for citizen science projects."

Our objectives were to examine the association of NC with NAFLD prevalence, and to determine the optimal cut-off of NC in identifying the presence of NAFLD among the employees of an academic institution in Bangkok, Thailand. In this cross-sectional study, 635 employees of an academic institution underwent anthropometric measurement and transient elastography following an overnight fast. NAFLD was defined as a CAP value &gt;238 dB.m-1. The NAFLD prevalence in men and women were 66.17% and 46.22%, respectively. The mean NCs for men and women with NAFLD were higher (38.53±0.31 cm and 35.83±0.48 cm, respectively) than those without NAFLD (33.58±0.24 and 31.098±0.14 cm, respectively) (p&lt;0.001). Metabolic markers including age, weight, BMI, NC, WC, WHR, FBS, triglycerides were significantly higher, HDL was significantly lower among participants with NAFLD compared to those without NAFLD (p&lt;0.05). NC was independently associated with NAFLD among women with OR (95%CI) of 1.17 (1.05, 1.32). The optimal cut-offs of NC to predict NAFLD were 37.07 cm (sensitivity: 70.50%; specificity: 68.90%) and 32.07 cm (sensitivity: 70.70%; specificity: 62.10%), respectively for men and women. NC significantly correlated with NAFLD in women. The optimal cut-off points of 32 cm and 37 cm for men and women, which similar to Chinese populations. Therefore, it can be used as a cost-effective tool to predict NAFLD. Trial Registration : Thai Clinical Trials Registry ( TCTR20210329006 )"

The field experiment was set up in a randomized block design with three replications of twelve different INM modules. During the rabi seasons of 2017-18 and 2018-19, the chickpea (cv. JG-315) was grown with a set of treatments. The crop's performance was evaluated in terms of growth, yield (grain and straw), nutritional content, and nutrient uptake under different treatments. At crop harvest, the physic-chemical characteristics of the soil were also evaluated. Finally, the relationship between the numerous examined parameters was determined. The results showed that integrated nutrient management modules had a positive impact on chickpea crop performance and productivity when compared to using only inorganic fertilizer. The INM modules dramatically increased soil organic carbon and improved soil health in terms of physical and chemical qualities, in addition to higher crop performance. Among the various modules, (1) application of 75% STCR dose + FYM @ 5t ha-1to maize followed by 100% P only to chickpea and (2) application of FYM @ 20t ha-1to maize followed by FYM @ 5t ha-1 to chickpea increased the productivity and nutrient uptake in chickpea, improved soil physico-chemical properties and reflected as viable technique in improving soil nutrient availability on sustainable basis."
https://openalex.org/W4213377066,"Genome-wide screens that have viability as a readout have been instrumental to identify essential genes. The development of gene knockout screens with the use of CRISPR-Cas has provided a more sensitive method to identify these genes. Here, we performed an exhaustive genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 phenotypic rescue screen to identify modulators of cytotoxicity induced by the pioneer transcription factor, DUX4. Misexpression of DUX4 due to a failure in epigenetic repressive mechanisms underlies facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FHSD), a complex muscle disorder that thus far remains untreatable. As the name implies, FSHD generally starts in the muscles of the face and shoulder girdle. Our CRISPR/Cas9 screen revealed no key effectors other than DUX4 itself that could modulate DUX4 cytotoxicity, suggesting that treatment efforts in FSHD should be directed towards direct modulation of DUX4 itself. Our screen did however reveal some rare and unexpected genomic events, that had an important impact on the interpretation of our data. Our findings may provide important considerations for planning future CRISPR/Cas9 phenotypic survival screens."
https://openalex.org/W4212888640,"Differences in drug responses in individuals are partly due to genetic variations in pharmacogenes, which differ among populations. Here, genome sequencing of 171 unrelated Thai individuals from all regions of Thailand was used to call star alleles of 51 pharmacogenes by Stargazer, determine allele and genotype frequencies, predict phenotype and compare high-impact variant frequencies between Thai and other populations. Three control genes, EGFR, VDR, and RYR1, were used, giving consistent results. Every individual had at least three genes with variant or altered phenotype. Forty of the 51 pharmacogenes had at least one individual with variant or altered phenotype. Moreover, thirteen genes had at least 25% of individuals with variant or altered phenotype including SLCO1B3 (97.08%), CYP3A5 (88.3%), CYP2C19 (60.82%), CYP2A6 (60.2%), SULT1A1 (56.14%), G6PD (54.39%), CYP4B1 (50.00%), CYP2D6 (48.65%), CYP2F1 (46.41%), NAT2 (40.35%), SLCO2B1 (28.95%), UGT1A1 (28.07%), and SLCO1B1 (26.79%).

Our results provide information that contributes to the implementation of pharmacogenetic testing in Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, bringing a step closer to personalized medicine."
https://openalex.org/W4212906458,"The Covid-19 pandemic imposed new constraints on empirical research and forced researchers to transfer from traditional laboratory research to the online environment. This study tested the validity of a web-based episodic memory paradigm by comparing participants’ memory performance for trustworthy and untrustworthy facial stimuli in a supervised laboratory setting and an unsupervised web setting. Consistent with previous results, we observed enhanced episodic memory for untrustworthy compared to trustworthy faces. Most importantly, this memory bias was comparable in the online and the laboratory experiment, suggesting that web-based procedures are a promising tool for memory research."
https://openalex.org/W4213015564,"Objective To design a physician and patient derived tool, the Adverse Event Unit (AEU), akin to currency (e.g. U.S. Dollar), to improve AE burden measurement independent of any particular disease or medication class. Patients/Methods A Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) online survey was administered to United States physicians with board certification or board eligibility in general neurology, subspecialty neurology, primary care internal medicine or family medicine, subspecialty internal medicine, general pediatrics, and subspecialty pediatrics. Physicians assigned value to 73 AE categories chosen from the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (CTCAE) relevant to neurologic disorder treatments. An online forced choice survey was administered to non-physician, potential patients, through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurK) to weight the severity of the same AE categories. Physician and non-physician data was combined to assign value to the AEU. Surveys completed between 1/2017 and 3/2019. Results 363 physicians rated the 73 AE categories derived from CTCAE. 660 non-physicians completed forced choice experiments comparing AEs. The AEU provides 0–10, weighted values for the AE categories studied that differ from the ordinal 1–4 CTCAE scale. For example, CTCAE severe diabetes (category 4) is assigned an AEU score of 9. Although non-physician input changed physician assigned AEU values, there was general agreement among physicians and non-physicians about severity of AEs. Conclusion The AEU has promise to be a useful, practical tool to add precision to AE burden measurement in the clinic and in comparative efficacy research with neurology patients. AEU utility will be assessed in planned comparative efficacy clinical trials."

Effects of vitamin D receptor activator were assessed on the basis of intact parathyroid hormone, corrected calcium, phosphorus, and fibroblast growth factor-23 levels; percent changes from baseline; proportions of patients who achieved target intact parathyroid hormone, corrected calcium, and phosphorus at Weeks 28–30; and adverse drug reactions. Intact parathyroid hormone, corrected calcium, phosphorus, and fibroblast growth factor-23 levels decreased in all groups; phosphorus and fibroblast growth factor-23 levels remained high in the high dose group. In the low and high dose groups, greater proportions of patients achieved the corrected calcium target compared with the no dose group ( p = 0.043). Ratios of intact-to-C-terminal fibroblast growth factor-23 decreased in all groups. In low and high dose groups, hypocalcemia was less common than in the no dose group ( p = 0.014). Evocalcet with concomitant vitamin D receptor activator demonstrated benefits such that more patients achieved the corrected calcium target and exhibited decreased fibroblast growth factor-23 synthesis; the incidence of hypocalcemia also decreased.

https://openalex.org/W4213085112,"A key barrier to the consistent use of condoms is their negative effect on sexual pleasure. Although sexual pleasure is a primary motivation for engaging in sex and is an integral part of overall sexual health, most programs to improve sexual health operate within a pregnancy and disease-prevention paradigm. A new condom, CSD500 (Futura Medical Developments; Surrey, UK), containing an erectogenic drug was developed for use among healthy couples to improve sexual pleasure by increasing penile firmness, size and erection duration. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test whether promoting the novel condom CSD500 for improved sexual pleasure is effective in reducing condomless sex compared to the provision of standard condoms with counseling for pregnancy and disease prevention. We randomized 500 adult, heterosexual, monogamous couples in Thanh Hoa province, Vietnam to receive either CSD500 (n = 248) or standard condoms (n = 252). At enrollment and after 2, 4, and 6 months, we interviewed women and sampled vaginal fluid to test for the presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an objective, biological marker of recent semen exposure. We registered the protocol before trial initiation at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02934620). Overall, 11.0% of women were PSA positive at enrollment. The proportion of follow-up visits with PSA-positivity did not differ between the intervention (6.8%) and control arms (6.7%; relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.54). Thus, we found no evidence that promoting an erectogenic condom to women in a monogamous, heterosexual relationship in Vietnam reduced their exposure to their partner's semen. These findings might not hold for other populations, especially those with a higher frequency of condomless sex."
https://openalex.org/W4213202149,"Objective To explore the subjective experience of physicians working in diabetic settings about their care relationships in order to find some unique clues contributing to physician professional health and capacity to manage patients’ adherence. Research design and methods An interview-based exploratory study has been carried out involving 18 physicians (77.8% female) with at least 3 years of clinical practice in diabetes care. In-depth interviews about the emotional experience with patients with diabetes were conducted and audio recorded. Interviews transcripts were analyzed through a computer-based text analysis which allowed the identification of thematic domains (Cluster Analysis) and latent factors (Correspondence Analysis) viewed through a psychodynamic and constructivist lens. Results Six thematic domains emerged respectively referring to: Concern (8.43%), Control (14.42%), Ambivalence (22.08%), Devotion (22.49%), Guilt (19.29%) and Strive for Achievement (13.30%). Moreover, three latent dimensions were taken into account, which explained 69.20% of data variance: Affect Repression (28.50%), Tendency to Repair (22.70%) and Anxiety Pattern (18.00%). Conclusions Overall, the results of the present study confirm the challenging nature of diabetes care. In particular, physicians ongoing effort to restore patients’ psychological integrity in chronic condition constitute the most novel finding above all. In this regard, the need for emotional labor in physicians’ education and training is suggested in order to both prevent burnout symptoms (e.g. depersonalization) and promote shared decision making in care relationships. However, findings should be treated as preliminary given the convenience nature of the sample and its reduced size."
https://openalex.org/W4213210474,"Background Currently, most usability benchmarking tools used within the eHealth domain are based on re-classifications of old usability frameworks or generic usability surveys. This makes them outdated and not well suited for the eHealth domain. Recently, a new ontology of usability factors was developed for the eHealth domain. It consists of eight categories: Basic System Performance (BSP), Task-Technology Fit (TTF), Accessibility (ACC), Interface Design (ID), Navigation &amp; Structure (NS), Information &amp; Terminology (IT), Guidance &amp; Support (GS) and Satisfaction (SAT). Objective The goal of this study is to develop a new usability benchmarking tool for eHealth, the eHealth UsaBility Benchmarking Instrument (HUBBI), that is based on a new ontology of usability factors for eHealth. Methods First, a large item pool was generated containing 66 items. Then, an online usability test was conducted, using the case study of a Dutch website for general health advice. Participants had to perform three tasks on the website, after which they completed the HUBBI. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we identified the items that assess each factor best and that, together, make up the HUBBI. Results A total of 148 persons participated. Our selection of items resulted in a shortened version of the HUBBI, containing 18 items. The category Accessibility is not included in the final version, due to the wide range of eHealth services and their heterogeneous populations. This creates a constantly different role of Accessibility, which is a problem for a uniform benchmarking tool., Conclusions The HUBBI is a new and comprehensive usability benchmarking tool for the eHealth domain. It assesses usability on seven domains (BSP, TTF, ID, NS, IT, GS, SAT) in which a score per domain is generated. This can help eHealth developers to quickly determine which areas of the eHealth system’s usability need to be optimized."
https://openalex.org/W4213211491,"This report describes how image processing harnessed to multivariate analysis techniques can be used as a bio-analytical tool for mastitis screening in cows using milk samples collected from 48 animals (32 from Jersey, 7 from Gir, and 9 from Guzerat cow breeds), totalizing a dataset of 144 sequential images was collected and analyzed. In this context, this methodology was developed based on the lactoperoxidase activity to assess mastitis using recorded images of a cuvette during a simple experiment and subsequent image treatments with an R statistics platform. The color of the sample changed from white to brown upon its exposure to reagents, which is a consequence of lactoperoxidase enzymatic reaction. Data analysis was performed to extract the channels from the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) color system, where the resulting dataset was evaluated with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), and Second-Order Regression (SO). Interesting results in terms of enzymatic activity correlation (R 2 = 0.96 and R 2 = 0.98 by MLR and SO, respectively) and of somatic cell count (R 2 = 0.97 and R 2 = 0.99 by MLR and SO, respectively), important mastitis indicators, were obtained using this simple method. Additionally, potential advantages can be accessed such as quality control of the dairy chain, easier bovine mastitis prognosis, lower cost, analytical frequency, and could serve as an evaluative parameter to verify the health of the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W4213254140,"Recently a technique based on the interaction between adhesion proteins extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes, known as SpyRing, has been widely used to improve the thermal resilience of enzymes, the assembly of biostructures, cancer cell recognition and other fields. It was believed that the covalent cyclization of protein skeleton caused by SpyRing reduces the conformational entropy of biological structure and improves its rigidity, thus improving the thermal resilience of the target enzyme. However, the effects of SpyTag/ SpyCatcher interaction with this enzyme are poorly understood, and their regulation of enzyme properties remains unclear. Here, for simplicity, we took the single domain enzyme lichenase from Bacillus subtilis 168 as an example, studied the interface interactions in the SpyRing by molecular dynamics simulations, and examined the effects of the changes of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals interaction on the thermal resilience of target enzyme. The simulations showed that the interface between SpyTag/SpyCatcher and the target enzyme is different from that found by geometric matching method and highlighted key mutations at the interface that might have effect on the thermal resilience of the enzyme. Our calculations highlighted interfacial interactions between enzyme and SpyTag/SpyCatcher, which might be useful in rational designs of the SpyRing."
https://openalex.org/W4213330540,"Epilepsy is one of the commonest chronic neurological disorders with serious health consequences. Treatment adherence is one of the determinants of seizure control. This study was designed to determine factors affecting antiepileptic drug adherence among children with epilepsy.A cross sectional study was conducted on 192 children with epilepsy (≤14 years of age) on follow-up at a pediatric neurology clinic in Southern Ethiopia from January 1st to August 30th, 2019. Medication Adherence was measured using the eight-item Morisky's medication adherence scale. Logistic regression analysis was done to determine factors associated with antiepileptic drug adherence.One hundred twenty-five (65%) of the study subjects were adherent to their medication. On multivariable analysis, factors predictive of good adherence included family size of ≤5 [AOR = 2.34, (95% CI: 1.07, 5.10); P = 0.03] and duration of epilepsy (<1year [AOR = 5.83, (95% CI: 1.48, 22.92); P = 0.012] and 1-2year [AOR = 4.58, (95% CI: 1.12, 18.77); P = 0.035]). Monthly family income of <1000 Ethiopian Birr [AOR = 0.18, (95% CI: 0.06, 0.61); P = 0.005] and presence of seizure attack in the past 3months [AOR = 0.23, 95% (CI: 0.10, 0.55); P = 0.001] predicted poor antiepileptic drug adherence.Adherence to antiepileptic drugs in children is low in our setting; low family income and occurrence of seizures while on treatment predicted poor adherence. Supplying free antiepileptic drugs to poor children and regular provision of information about expected treatment response to children with epilepsy and their caretakers may help improve adherence."
https://openalex.org/W4212763460,"Durum wheat is the tenth most valuable crop on a global scale. The aim of this study was to compare the phenotypic variation of T. durum accessions of different origin with contemporary spring cultivars of this cereal species. One hundred and two accessions and 12 contemporary cultivars of Triticum durum Desf. as well as Kamut® wheat (T. turanicum), a Triticum species closely related to T. durum, were analyzed. The aim of this study was to describe the degree of variation in the phenotypic traits of grain and selected traits associated with technological quality. The examined genotypes were characterized by considerable phenotypic variation, and they can be a valuable source of material for genetic recombination in durum wheat breeding. The analyzed accessions were characterized by a higher average content of protein (16.48 vs. 14.56%) and wet gluten (38.04 vs. 32.07%), higher Zeleny sedimentation values (69.7 vs. 60.4ml), and higher flour strength (W index values of 404.64 vs. 353.47) than the reference cultivars. The kernels of the evaluated accessions and cultivars did not differ significantly in average crease depth, but significant differences were observed in the values of descriptors directly linked with kernel size, especially kernel image area and minimal Feret diameter. The traits responsible for the processing suitability of grain were more strongly correlated with color descriptors than shape descriptors, which suggests that color parameters can be used to select high-quality breeding material. The analyzed accessions have two major weaknesses, namely relatively low yields (22.6 dt ha-1 on average) and undesirable grain color, indicative of low carotenoid concentration. The accessions deposited in gene banks do not meet the relevant agronomic requirements. However, both grain yield and carotenoid concentration are polygenic traits which can be improved if desirable combinations of QTLs are assembled in breeding lines and cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W4212870116,"In the continuous review reorder point, base-stock ( s , S ) policy, the replenishment order is launched when the inventory position reaches the reorder point, s . It is commonly assumed that the inventory position is exactly equal to the reorder point at the moment the order is launched, when actually it could be lower at that moment. This implies neglecting the possible undershoots at the reorder point, which has a direct impact on the calculation of the expected shortages per replenishment cycle. This article presents a method for an exact calculation of the fill rate (fraction of demand that is immediately satisfied from shelf) which takes explicit account of the existence of undershoots and is applicable to any discrete demand distribution function in a context of lost sales. This method is based on the determination of the stock probability vector at the moment the replenishment order is launched. Furthermore, neglecting the undershoots is shown to lead to an overestimation of the fill rate, particularly when we move farther away from the unitary demand assumption. From a practical point of view, this behaviour involves underestimating the base-stock level, S , when a target fill rate is set for its determination. The method proposed in this paper overcomes these shortcomings."
https://openalex.org/W4212871170,"This article presents a new framework for understanding how people think personality changes across the life span. In two studies we examined the correspondence among how people thought their personalities would change, how people in general change, and changes found in a meta-analysis of changes in personality. We conceptualized and measured personality in terms of the Big Five model (FFM). In Study 1 participants rated either how they had changed from the past to the present or how they would change from the present to the future. We found that for openness to experience and social vitality participants thought these traits had increased from the past to the present, whereas participants did not think they would change from the present to the future. In contrast, participants thought that conscientiousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability would increase from the present to the future, although they did not report changes in most of these traits from the past to the present. The changes that occurred in Study 1 correspond to changes of personality found in previous research. In Study 2 participants rated themselves and other people on the FFM traits for each of nine intervals representing the lifespan. We found that people perceived changes in themselves to be similar to the changes found in meta-analyses, and perceptions of change in the self-corresponded to perception of changes for others. We believe these results can be explained by recognizing that people share normative based beliefs about how people change at certain age. Nevertheless, we also found that people perceived themselves as better than others, i.e., relatively greater increases in some positive traits and relatively smaller decreases in some negative traits, being first among equals. We discuss possible explanations for this phenomenon, which according to our knowledge, has not been discussed in this context previously."
https://openalex.org/W4212916376,"Background Chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancers are on the rise. Most of the risk factors of these diseases commence in Adolescence. Therefore, a cluster randomised controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of school-based health promotion intervention on the risk factors of chronic diseases. Methodology Considering school as a cluster, twelve schools will be randomly selected from the public schools of Chandigarh, a city in India. After baseline assessment, six schools will be randomly allocated to intervention and six to the control arm. Study participants will be students of 8 th grade (age 10–16 years), their parents and teachers. A sample of 360 students (12 clusters x 30 students) has been estimated to provide statistically valid inference. The PRECEDE PROCEED Model will be used to develop health promotion interventions to prevent the use of an unbalanced diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, and tobacco. Interventions will be implemented for six-months in the school setting. For students, the intervention will comprise interactive learning sessions of 30 minutes duration per week and physical activity sessions of 30 minutes duration four times every week. Educational sessions will be conducted for parents and teachers for 30 minutes, four times during the intervention period. Primary outcomes will be changes in the prevalence of behavioural risk factors from pre- to post-intervention. Changes in anthropometric, physiological, and biochemical measures will be the secondary outcomes. The difference-in-difference (DID) method will be used to measure the net change in the outcomes. Discussion It is essential to understand whether health promotion interventions implemented in the school setting simultaneously targeting adolescents, teachers, and parents are effective. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model for planning, implementing, and evaluating the intervention as part of a cluster Randomized Controlled Trial design with DID analysis, could objectively assess the impact."

https://openalex.org/W4213018503,"Aphids can have a significant impact on the growth and commercial yield of spruce plantations. Here we develop a mechanistic deterministic mathematical model for the dynamics of the green spruce aphid (Elatobium abietum Walker) growing on Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.). These grow in a northern British climate in managed plantations, with planting, thinning and a 60-year rotation. Aphid infestation rarely kills the tree but can reduce growth by up to 55%. We used the Edinburgh Forest Model (efm) to simulate spruce tree growth. The aphid sub-model is described in detail in an appendix. The only environmental variable which impacts immediately on aphid dynamics is air temperature which varies diurnally and seasonally. The efm variables that are directly significant for the aphid are leaf area and phloem nitrogen and carbon. Aphid population predictions include dying out, annual, biennual and other complex patterns, including chaos. Predicted impacts on plantation yield of managed forests can be large and variable, as has been observed; they are also much affected by temperature, CO2 concentration and other climate variables. However, in this system, increased CO2 concentration appears to ameliorate the severity of the effects of increasing temperatures coupled to worsening aphid infestations on plantation yield."

Quantitative PCR (qPCR), also known as real-time PCR, is the most frequently used technique for measuring miRNA expression levels. The use of this technique, however, requires that expression data be normalized against reference genes. The problem is that a universal internal control for quantitative analysis of miRNA expression by qPCR has yet to be known. The aim of this work was to find the miRNAs with stable expression in the thyroid gland, brain and bone marrow according to NanoString nCounter miRNA quantification data. As a results, the most stably expressed miRNAs were as follows: miR-361-3p, -151a-3p and -29b-3p in the thyroid gland; miR-15a-5p, -194-5p and -532-5p in the brain; miR-140-5p, -148b-3p and -362-5p in bone marrow; and miR-423-5p, -28-5p and -532-5p, no matter what tissue type.

The objective of the current study was to analyze the metastasis patterns and prognosis of elderly patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and compare it to patients of other ages.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was utilized to select MBC patients from 2010 to 2015. Chi-squared test was used to compare clinicopathological characteristics among different aged groups. The Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox model were utilized for survival analysis.A total of 10479 MBC patients were included, among which 1036 (9.9%) patients were aged over 80 years. Compared with other aged group, the elderly patients tended to have a higher proportion of HR+/Her2- subtype, white race, lower tumor differentiation, and receive less treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy (P< 0.001). MBC patients with different age presented with distinctive metastatic patterns. The older patients were more likely to have lung metastasis, but less likely to have bone, brain, liver and multiple sites metastasis than the younger group (P <0.001). The proportion of TNBC subtype increased substantially in the older patients with brain metastasis, compared to the younger and middle-aged group. The old age was demonstrated to significantly associate with worse prognosis of MBC patients. Additionally, our findings also showed that older MBC patients could achieve dramatical overall survival benefit from surgery (HR = 0.58; P <0.001) and chemotherapy (HR = 0.59; P <0.001), but not the radiotherapy (HR = 0.96; P = 0.097).The elderly MBC patients presented with distinctive metastatic patterns, clinical characteristics, and prognostic outcomes compared with younger patients. Our findings could assist clinicians in making appropriate therapeutic decision."

https://openalex.org/W4213118021,"Surgical training using live animals such as pigs is one of the best ways of achieving skilled techniques and fostering confidence in preclinical medical students and surgeon trainees. However, due to animal welfare ethics, laboratory animals’ usage for training should be kept to a minimum. We have developed a novel kidney organ model utilizing a simple procedure in which the kidney is first refluxed with N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) solution for 1 hour in its bath, followed by permeation for 23 hours, with a subsequent freshwater refluxed for 48 hours in the washing step. Surgical simulation of the prepared kidney model (NVP-fixed kidney) was compared with three types of other basic known simulation models (fresh kidney, freeze-thaw kidney, and FA-fixed kidney) by various evaluations. We found the NVP-fixed kidney to mimicked fresh kidney function the most, pertaining to the hardness, and strength of the renal parenchyma. Moreover, the NVP-fixed kidney demonstrated successful blood-like fluids perfusion and electrocautery. Further, we confirmed that surgical training could be performed under conditions closer to actual clinical practice. Our findings suggest that our model does not only contribute to improving surgical skills but also inspires the utilization of otherwise, discarded inedible livestock organs as models for surgical training."
https://openalex.org/W4213345506,"The Pacific Islands Families (PIF) study is a birth cohort study designed to increase knowledge about the growth and development of Pacific children living in Auckland, New Zealand. Adolescence is a critical time of growth and development, yet the roles of physical function and body composition in metabolic health at this life stage are not clear. We aimed to investigate associations between measures of physical function (the 6-minute-walk-test (6MWT)), heart rate changes before and after the 6MWT, handgrip strength, body composition including appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASMM) measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and biomarkers of metabolic health from a fasting blood sample.A total of 200 youth (98 girls, 102 boys) aged 14-15 years, from the birth-cohort of children in the Pacific Islands families study were measured. In girls, the proportion of ASMM was lower and fat higher than in boys. Controlling for age, a 1% increase in ASMM predicted a longer walk distance (+6.3, 95%CI 2.2, 10.4 m in girls; +7.1, 95%CI 4.4, 9.1 m in boys) and lower heart rate following the 6MWT. ASMM and fat mass were independently predictive of maximal handgrip strength which was increased by 1.4 (1.0,1.8) kg in girls and 1.7 (1.3, 2.0) kg in boys for each kg increase in ASMM and reduced by 0.23 (0.08, 0.38) kg in girls and 0.26 (0.14, 0.37) kg in boys for each kg increase in fat mass. Lower total cholesterol and LDL were associated with an increase in distance walked in boys only. For each year of age, distance walked was reduced by 34 (15, 53) m in girls and 59 (36,84) m in boys. These findings should be explored further in the context of other influences such as food security, opportunities for physical activity and cultural expectations."
