https://openalex.org/W2971488563,"Metastasis is the major driver of death in patients with cancer. Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis have been proposed to initiate following loss of the intercellular adhesion protein, E-cadherin1,2, on the basis of inverse correlations between in vitro migration and E-cadherin levels3. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the observation that most breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas and express E-cadherin in primary tumours and metastases4. To resolve this discrepancy, we tested the genetic requirement for E-cadherin in metastasis using mouse and human models of both luminal and basal invasive ductal carcinomas. Here we show that E-cadherin promotes metastasis in diverse models of invasive ductal carcinomas. While loss of E-cadherin increased invasion, it also reduced cancer cell proliferation and survival, circulating tumour cell number, seeding of cancer cells in distant organs and metastasis outgrowth. Transcriptionally, loss of E-cadherin was associated with upregulation of genes involved in transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), reactive oxygen species and apoptosis signalling pathways. At the cellular level, disseminating E-cadherin-negative cells exhibited nuclear enrichment of SMAD2/3, oxidative stress and increased apoptosis. Colony formation of E-cadherin-negative cells was rescued by inhibition of TGFβ-receptor signalling, reactive oxygen accumulation or apoptosis. Our results reveal that E-cadherin acts as a survival factor in invasive ductal carcinomas during the detachment, systemic dissemination and seeding phases of metastasis by limiting reactive oxygen-mediated apoptosis. Identifying molecular strategies to inhibit E-cadherin-mediated survival in metastatic breast cancer cells may have potential as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer."

The intensity of UHIs varies with population size and mean annual precipitation, but a unifying explanation for this variation is lacking, and there are no geographically targeted guidelines for heat mitigation. Here we analyse summertime differences between urban and rural surface temperatures (ΔTs) worldwide and find a nonlinear increase in ΔTs with precipitation that is controlled by water or energy limitations on evapotranspiration and that modulates the scaling of ΔTs with city size. We introduce a coarse-grained model that links population, background climate, and UHI intensity, and show that urban-rural differences in evapotranspiration and convection efficiency are the main determinants of warming. The direct implication of these nonlinearities is that mitigation strategies aimed at increasing green cover and albedo are more efficient in dry regions, whereas the challenge of cooling tropical cities will require innovative solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2971497300,"Influenza A viruses are responsible for seasonal epidemics, and pandemics can arise from the transmission of novel zoonotic influenza A viruses to humans1,2. Influenza A viruses contain a segmented negative-sense RNA genome, which is transcribed and replicated by the viral-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (FluPolA) composed of PB1, PB2 and PA subunits3-5. Although the high-resolution crystal structure of FluPolA of bat influenza A virus has previously been reported6, there are no complete structures available for human and avian FluPolA. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of genomic viral RNA (vRNA) replication-which proceeds through a complementary RNA (cRNA) replicative intermediate, and requires oligomerization of the polymerase7-10-remain largely unknown. Here, using crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, we determine the structures of FluPolA from human influenza A/NT/60/1968 (H3N2) and avian influenza A/duck/Fujian/01/2002 (H5N1) viruses at a resolution of 3.0-4.3 Å, in the presence or absence of a cRNA or vRNA template. In solution, FluPolA forms dimers of heterotrimers through the C-terminal domain of the PA subunit, the thumb subdomain of PB1 and the N1 subdomain of PB2. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of monomeric FluPolA bound to the cRNA template reveals a binding site for the 3' cRNA at the dimer interface. We use a combination of cell-based and in vitro assays to show that the interface of the FluPolA dimer is required for vRNA synthesis during replication of the viral genome. We also show that a nanobody (a single-domain antibody) that interferes with FluPolA dimerization inhibits the synthesis of vRNA and, consequently, inhibits virus replication in infected cells. Our study provides high-resolution structures of medically relevant FluPolA, as well as insights into the replication mechanisms of the viral RNA genome. In addition, our work identifies sites in FluPolA that could be targeted in the development of antiviral drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2972262750,"The availability of large amounts of high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic data has provided opportunity to understand regulation of the cellular transcriptome with an unprecedented level of detail. As a result, research has advanced from identifying gene expression patterns associated with particular conditions to elucidating signalling pathways that regulate expression. There are over 1,000 transcription factors (TFs) in vertebrates that play a role in this regulation. Determining which of these are likely to be controlling a set of genes can be assisted by computational prediction, utilising experimentally verified binding site motifs. Here we present CiiiDER, an integrated computational toolkit for transcription factor binding analysis, written in the Java programming language, to make it independent of computer operating system. It is operated through an intuitive graphical user interface with interactive, high-quality visual outputs, making it accessible to all researchers. CiiiDER predicts transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) across regulatory regions of interest, such as promoters and enhancers derived from any species. It can perform an enrichment analysis to identify TFs that are significantly over- or under-represented in comparison to a bespoke background set and thereby elucidate pathways regulating sets of genes of pathophysiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2904212763,"Phase transitions are driven by collective fluctuations of a system's constituents that emerge at a critical point. This mechanism has been extensively explored for classical and quantum systems in equilibrium, whose critical behavior is described by a general theory of phase transitions. Recently, however, fundamentally distinct phase transitions have been discovered for out-of-equilibrium quantum systems, which can exhibit critical behavior that defies this description and is not well understood. A paradigmatic example is the many-body-localization (MBL) transition, which marks the breakdown of quantum thermalization. Characterizing quantum critical behavior in an MBL system requires the measurement of its entanglement properties over space and time, which has proven experimentally challenging due to stringent requirements on quantum state preparation and system isolation. Here, we observe quantum critical behavior at the MBL transition in a disordered Bose-Hubbard system and characterize its entanglement properties via its quantum correlations. We observe strong correlations, whose emergence is accompanied by the onset of anomalous diffusive transport throughout the system, and verify their critical nature by measuring their system-size dependence. The correlations extend to high orders in the quantum critical regime and appear to form via a sparse network of many-body resonances that spans the entire system. Our results unify the system's microscopic structure with its macroscopic quantum critical behavior, and they provide an essential step towards understanding criticality and universality in non-equilibrium systems."

https://openalex.org/W2971783845,"Development is often assumed to be hardwired in the genome, but several lines of evidence indicate that it is susceptible to environmental modulation with potential long-term consequences, including in mammals1,2. The embryonic germline is of particular interest because of the potential for intergenerational epigenetic effects. The mammalian germline undergoes extensive DNA demethylation3–7 that occurs in large part by passive dilution of methylation over successive cell divisions, accompanied by active DNA demethylation by TET enzymes3,8–10. TET activity has been shown to be modulated by nutrients and metabolites, such as vitamin C11–15. Here we show that maternal vitamin C is required for proper DNA demethylation and the development of female fetal germ cells in a mouse model. Maternal vitamin C deficiency does not affect overall embryonic development but leads to reduced numbers of germ cells, delayed meiosis and reduced fecundity in adult offspring. The transcriptome of germ cells from vitamin-C-deficient embryos is remarkably similar to that of embryos carrying a null mutation in Tet1. Vitamin C deficiency leads to an aberrant DNA methylation profile that includes incomplete demethylation of key regulators of meiosis and transposable elements. These findings reveal that deficiency in vitamin C during gestation partially recapitulates loss of TET1, and provide a potential intergenerational mechanism for adjusting fecundity to environmental conditions. The effect of vitamin C deprivation on mouse germline development is analysed, revealing that maternal vitamin C is required for proper DNA demethylation and the development of fetal oocytes, whereas the lack of vitamin C during pregnancy leads to reduced female fecundity in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2972184784,"Despite the ease of health care access and the waiver of copayments for cancer patients, treatment is delayed in a small proportion of Taiwanese patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. In this study, we explored the relationship between the time interval from diagnosis to treatment and survival in cervical cancer patients.The study was a retrospective population-based observational study conducted between 2004 and 2010. In Taiwan, 12,020 patients were newly diagnosed with cervical cancer from 2004 to 2010, and 9,693 patients (80.6%) were enrolled in our final analysis.Most of the patients received treatment within 90 days of diagnosis (n = 9,341, 96.37%). After adjustment for other variables, patients who received treatment between 90 and 180 days and >180 days after diagnosis had a 1.33 (95% CI: 1.02-1.72, P < 0.05) and 1.36 (95% CI: 1.12-1.65, P < 0.05) times higher risk of death, respectively, than those who received treatment within 90 days. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients treated after 90 days from diagnosis had a lower overall survival rate than those treated within 90 days. In analysis stratifying the patients according to their initial tumor stage, namely stages I and II and stage III and IV, the time interval from diagnosis to treatment remained a significant prognosticator in those who received treatment >180 days after diagnosis.A longer interval between diagnosis and treatment is associated with poorer prognosis among cervical cancer patients."

https://openalex.org/W2972212793,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor, largely known for its role in xenobiotic metabolism and detoxification as well as its crucial role as a regulator of inflammation. Here, we have compared a cohort wild-type and AhR-null mice along aging to study the relationship between this receptor and age-associated inflammation, termed as ""inflammaging,"" both at a systemic and the CNS level. Our results show that AhR deficiency is associated with a premature aged phenotype, characterized by early inflammaging, as shown by an increase in plasma cytokines levels. The absence of AhR also promotes the appearance of brain aging anatomic features, such as the loss of the white matter integrity. In addition, AhR-/- mice present an earlier spatial memory impairment and an enhanced astrogliosis in the hippocampus when compared with their age-matched AhR+/+ controls. Importantly, we have found that AhR protein levels decrease with age in this brain structure, strongly suggesting a link between AhR and aging.-Bravo-Ferrer, I., Cuartero, M. I., Medina, V., Ahedo-Quero, D., Peña-Martínez, C., Pérez-Ruíz, A., Fernández-Valle, M. E., Hernández-Sánchez, C., Fernández-Salguero, P. M., Lizasoain, I., Moro, M. A.

https://openalex.org/W2971630980,"When multiple species are vulnerable to a common set of predators, it is advantageous for individuals to recognize information about the environment provided by other species. Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and other small mammals have been shown to exploit heterospecific alarm calls as indicators of danger. However, many species-especially birds-emit non-alarm auditory cues such as contact calls when perceived predator threat is low, and such public information may serve as cues of safety to eavesdroppers. We tested the hypothesis that eavesdropping gray squirrels respond to ""bird chatter"" (contact calls emitted by multiple individuals when not under threat of predation) as a measure of safety. We compared vigilance behavior of free-ranging squirrels in the presence of playbacks of bird chatter vs non-masking ambient background noise lacking chatter after priming them with a playback recording of a red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) call. Squirrels responded to the hawk call playbacks by significantly increasing the proportion of time they spent engaged in vigilance behaviors and the number of times they looked up during otherwise non-vigilance behaviors, indicating that they perceived elevated predation threat prior to the playbacks of chatter or ambient noise. Following the hawk playback, squirrels exposed to the chatter treatment engaged in significantly lower levels of vigilance behavior (i.e., standing, freezing, fleeing, looking up) and the decay in vigilance behaviors was more rapid than in squirrels exposed to the ambient noise treatment, suggesting squirrels use information contained in bird chatter as a cue of safety. These findings suggest that eastern gray squirrels eavesdrop on non-alarm auditory cues as indicators of safety and adjust their vigilance level in accordance with the vigilance level of other species that share the same predators."
https://openalex.org/W2971621246,"The antifungal activity of magnolol and honokiol, two naturally occurring hydroxylated biphenyls, and of their synthetic derivatives was evaluated on a collection of representative isolates of Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani and F. verticillioides of clinical and ecological concern. The tested compounds were proposed as a ‘natural’ alternative to conventional fungicides, even though a larger range of concentrations (5–400 μg/ml) was applied. The activity of magnolol and honokiol was compared with that of terbinafine (0.1–10 μg/ml), and fluconazole (1–50 μg/ml), two fungicides widely used in treating fungal infections on humans. Magnolol showed similar fungicidal activity compared to fluconazole, whereas honokiol was more effective in inhibiting mycelium growth compared to this fungicide on all tested clinical Fusarium spp. isolates. Compared to terbinafine, honokiol showed similar antifungal activity when tested on clinical F. solani isolates, whereas magnolol was less effective at all selected concentrations (5–400 μg/ml). The different position of the phenol-OH group, as well as its protection, explain different in vitro activities between magnolol, honokiol, and their derivatives. Furthermore, magnolol showed mycelium dry weight reduction at a concentration of 0.5 mM when tested on a set of agricultural isolates of Fusaria, leading to complete inhibition of some of them. Magnolol and honokiol are proposed as efficient and safe candidates for treating clinically relevant Fusaria."
https://openalex.org/W2982021167,"Over the past decade, thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified, many of which play crucial roles in normal physiology and human disease. LncRNAs can interact with chromatin and then recruit protein complexes to remodel chromatin states, thus regulating gene expression. However, how lncRNA-chromatin interactions contribute to their biological functions is largely unknown. Here, we collected and constructed an atlas of 188,647 lncRNA-chromatin interactions in human and mouse. All lncRNAs showed diverse epigenetic modification patterns at their binding sites, especially the marks of enhancer activity. Functional analysis of lncRNA target genes further revealed that lncRNAs could exert their functions by binding to both promoter and distal regulatory elements, especially the distal regulatory elements. Intriguingly, many important pathways were observed to be widely regulated by lncRNAs through distal binding. For example, NEAT1, a cancer lncRNA, controls 13.3% of genes in the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by interacting with distal regulatory elements. In addition, “two-gene” signatures composed of a lncRNA and its distal target genes, such as HOTAIR-CRIM1, provided significant clinical benefits relative to the lncRNA alone.

During this process, three lncRNAs (i.e. DACOR1, LincHSC2, and long noncoding RNAs transcribed by ERV-9 LTR retrotransposon) were removed due to lack of even and odd samples, low fold-enrichment, or lack of annotation in GENCODE version 27. As a result, a total of 77,031 and 111,616 lncRNA-chromatin interactions were identified in human and mouse, respectively (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3). On average, each lncRNA binds to about 6,420 and 12,401 sites in human and mouse, respectively (Fig. 1A and Fig. S3, “supporting Notes). For the human lncRNA 7SK with binding sites identified in H1 and HeLa-S3 cell lines, a high correlation was observed, indicating the high reproducibility of binding sites identified (Fig. S4). The average size of binding sites was smaller than 1 kb expected for SRA whose average size was around 2 kb (Fig. 1B). Most binding sites were distal to the transcription start sites (TSSs) of the closest genes (including protein-coding and noncoding genes) (Fig. 1C, Fig. S5). For these human lncRNAs, their binding sites showed significantly higher conservation than DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) based on phatCons score (21Siepel A. Bejerano G. Pedersen J.S. Hinrichs A.S. Hou M. Rosenbloom K. Clawson H. Spieth J. Hiller L.W.

Motif discovery of lncRNA-binding sites revealed significant de novo DNA-binding motifs for each lncRNA using HOMER (23Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N. Bertolino E. Lin Y.C. Laslo P. Cheng J.X. Murre C.

For example, both HOTAIR- and MEG3-binding sites were enriched in a GA-rich polypurine motif, which was identified as a shared feature of the polycomb response element (24Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Structure of a polycomb response element and in vitro binding of polycomb group complexes containing GAGA factor.Mol. Cell.

In addition, these de novo motifs could match the primary sequences of lncRNAs and several motif instances occupied in the lncRNA sequence were identified (Fig. 1E, Table S2), which was probably due to the formation of DNA:RNA triplex (20West J.A.

Chang H.W. Long noncoding RNA as modular scaffold of histone modification complexes.Science. 2010; 329 (20616235): 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar). LncRNAs have emerged as key regulators of epigenetic modifications by recruiting chromatin-remodeling complexes to specific genomic loci (25Tsai M.C. Manor O. Wan Y. Mosammaparast N. Wang J.K. Lan F. Shi Y. Segal E. Chang H.W. Long noncoding RNA as modular scaffold of histone modification complexes.Science. 2010; 329 (20616235): 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (2599) Google Scholar). To explore the associations between lncRNA-binding sites and epigenetic modifications, we selected five core histone modifications (including H3K4me3, H3K4me1, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3) with available data in the matched tissue/cell types (Table S3), and evaluated whether these histone markers were significantly enriched for lncRNA-binding sites using genome association tool (GAT) (26Heger A. Webber C. Goodson M. Ponting C.P. Lunter G. GAT: a simulation framework for testing the association of genomic intervals.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 (23782611): 2046-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (“Experimental procedures”). Only lncRNAs (9 human and 8 mouse lncRNAs) with at least two distinct epigenetic modification data available in the matched cell lines were used to analyze the associations between epigenetic marks and their DNA-binding sites. All of the lncRNAs showed diverse associations with at least two epigenetic marks (Fig. 2A and Fig. S6A). Nearly all human lncRNAs were significantly enriched in H3K4me3, associated primarily with active promoters (GAT, q-value <0.05), and all showed significant enrichments for H3K4me1 and H3K27ac, two markers for active enhancers (GAT, q-value <0.05). To further investigate the epigenetic patterns of lncRNA-binding sites, we calculated the levels of five core histone modifications and chromatin accessibility (DNase-seq) around lncRNA-binding sites (2 kb centered on the midpoint of binding peaks) at a 10-bp resolution in the matched cell lines (Table S3, “Experimental procedures”). By means of unsupervised k-means clustering analysis, we found that lncRNAs showed diverse epigenetic modification patterns at their binding sites, including promoter- (high H3K4me3), enhancer- (high H3K4me1 and low H3K4me3), repressed- (high H3K27me3), transcription elongation-associated (high H3K36me3), and quiescent patterns (low signal) (Fig. 2B and Fig. S6B). Focusing on a well-known lncRNA, HOTAIR, four distinct epigenetic modification patterns were observed. The majority of HOTAIR-binding sites (50.1%) were located within quiescent regions. A quarter of binding sites (26.64%) occurred at repressed regions (high H3K27me3) (Fig. 2B), consistent with previous reports that HOTAIR could mediate H3K27me3 by recruiting PRC2 complex (8Gupta R.A. Shah N. Wang K.C. Kim J. Horlings H.M. Wond D.J. Tsai M.C. Hung T. Argani P. Rinn J.L. Wang Y. et al.Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR reprograms chromatin state to promote cancer metastasis.Nature. 2010; 464 (20393566): 1071-107610.1038/nature08975Crossref PubMed Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). Notably, these binding sites also showed a moderate level of H3K4me1, indicating that many may represent poised enhancers. Interestingly, we also found 11.68% of HOTAIR-bindings sites exhibiting an active pattern (3.17% with high levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; 8.57% with high levels of H3K4me1 and H3K27ac). As for NEAT1, the majority of binding sites (51.08%) showed high levels of H3K4me3, consistent with previous findings that NEAT1 substantially bound at promoters (24Horard B. Tatout C. Poux S. Pirrotta V. Structure of a polycomb response element and in vitro binding of polycomb group complexes containing GAGA factor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (10757803): 3187-319710.1128/MCB.20.9.3187-3197.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we evaluated the associations between lncRNA-binding sites and regulatory elements (including promoters and enhancers) using GAT (26Heger A. Webber C. Goodson M. Ponting C.P. Lunter G. GAT: a simulation framework for testing the association of genomic intervals.Bioinformatics. 2013; 29 (23782611): 2046-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) (“Experimental procedures”). As a result, HOTAIR, MALAT1, NEAT1, SRA, 7SK, and TERC (both H1 and HeLa-S3 cell line) showed significant enrichments for promoters, whereas SNHG1, NEAT1, SRA, 7SK (H1 cell line), TERC, and DINO showed significant enrichments for enhancers in human (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our results showed diverse epigenetic modification patterns at lncRNA-binding sites, suggesting that lncRNAs may carry out more complex functions through regulating distinct types of regulatory elements. Next, we explored the association between lncRNA-binding regions and potential target genes. For proximal lncRNA-binding regions, we directly assigned genes whose promoters (TSS ± 1 kb) overlap with lncRNA-binding regions to the corresponding lncRNAs as the promoter target genes (Fig. S7A, left). When lncRNAs interact with distal regulatory elements (>2 kb to nearest TSSs), we identified distal target genes by combining long-range chromosomal interaction data. Because there were not enough cell line-matched chromosomal interaction data available (only MCF7 and HeLa-S3), we aggregated long-range chromosomal interaction data from 24 cell types and tissues from the 4Dgenome database (27Teng L. He B. Wang J. Tan K. 4DGenome: a comprehensive database of chromatin interactions.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31 (25788621): 2560-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After that, a total of 351,083 promoter-centered chromatin interactions (one end of an interaction should at least overlap with a promoter) were extracted. Finally, target genes of distal lncRNA-binding regions were determined by requiring distal lncRNA-binding regions interacting with gene promoters by a DNA loop (Fig. S7A, right). As a result, we found that these lncRNAs had a large difference in the counts of target genes. An average of 3,100 protein-coding genes (PCGs) were identified for each lncRNA (Fig. S7B). LncRNA 7SK has the maximum number of target genes (8,051 PCGs), whereas MALAT1 has the minimum number of target genes (120 PCGs). Comparing promoter targets to distal targets, we found that, as expected, the numbers of distal targets were far more than promoter targets in most of the lncRNAs (the proportions of distal targets ranged from 53.5 to 94.4%). Interestingly, we observed significant overlaps between promoter and distal targets for NEAT1, MALAT1, TERC, SRA, 7SK (p value <10e-7, hypergeometric test, Fig. S8), suggesting that lncRNAs can target the same genes by binding to the promoter and distal regulatory elements. Furthermore, through analyzing publically available transcriptome dataset after knockdown of lncRNAs (MEG3, LED, DINO, NEAT1, and MALAT1, Table S4), a significant overlap between the deregulated genes by lncRNA manipulation and their target genes were found (p value <0.05, hypergeometric test, Fig. S9), suggesting that these lncRNAs can be involved in controlling or regulating the expression of their bound targets. Subsequently, we performed GO and KEGG functional enrichment analysis for the target genes of each lncRNA. As a result, numerous biological processes were significantly enriched for some lncRNAs. Among these lncRNAs, NEAT1, LED, SRA, TERC, and MEG3 showed significant enrichments with their known functions (FDR < 0.05, hypergeometric test, Fig. 3A). Take the cancer-related lncRNA NEAT1 as an example (28Zheng X. Zhang Y. Liu Y. Fang L. Li L. Sun J. Pan Z. Xin W. Huang P. HIF-2α activated lncRNA NEAT1 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis by affecting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.J. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2972187208,"To understand the ecology of juvenile chum salmon during early marine life after their downstream migration, we developed a quantitative PCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) method specific for chum salmon and investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of eDNA in Otsuchi Bay, Iwate, Japan. Indoor aquarium experiments demonstrated the following characteristics of chum salmon eDNA: (1) the eDNA shedding and degradation were time- and water temperature-dependent and the bacterial abundance could contribute to the eDNA decay, (2) fecal discharge may not be the main source of eDNA, and (3) a strong positive Pearson correlation was found between the number of juveniles and the eDNA amounts. As we discovered strong PCR inhibition from the seawater samples of the bay, we optimized the eDNA assay protocol for natural seawater samples by adding a further purification step and modification of PCR mixture. The intensive eDNA analysis in the spring of 2017 and 2018 indicated that juvenile chum salmon initially inhabited in shallow waters in the shorefront area and then spread over the bay from January to June. The eDNA data also pointed out that outmigration of juvenile chum salmon to open ocean temporarily suspended in April, possibly being associated with the dynamics of the Oyashio Current as suggested by a previous observation. The eDNA method thus enables us large-scale and comprehensive surveys without affecting populations to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of juvenile chum salmon."
https://openalex.org/W2971871274,"Our previous single-cell based gene expression analysis pointed out significant variations of LDHA level during erythroid differentiation. Deeper investigations highlighted that a metabolic switch occurred along differentiation of erythroid cells. More precisely we showed that self-renewing progenitors relied mostly upon lactate-productive glycolysis, and required LDHA activity, whereas differentiating cells, mainly involved mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). These metabolic rearrangements were coming along with a particular temporary event, occurring within the first 24h of erythroid differentiation. The activity of glycolytic metabolism and OXPHOS rose jointly with oxgene consumption dedicated to ATP production at 12-24h of the differentiation process before lactate-productive glycolysis sharply fall down and energy needs decline. Finally, we demonstrated that the metabolic switch mediated through LDHA drop and OXPHOS upkeep might be necessary for erythroid differentiation. We also discuss the possibility that metabolism, gene expression and epigenetics could act together in a circular manner as a driving force for differentiation."

Here, we established a serum microRNA (miRNA)-based prediction model for the emergence of new distant metastases after eribulin treatment. Serum samples were collected from metastatic breast cancer patients prior to eribulin treatment and comprehensively evaluated by miRNA microarray. The prediction model for estimating eribulin efficacy was established using the logistic LASSO regression model. Serum samples were collected from 147 patients, of which 52 developed at least one new distant metastasis after eribulin monotherapy and 95 did not develop new distant metastases. A combination of eight serum miRNAs (miR-4483, miR-8089, miR-4755-3p, miR-296-3p, miR-575, miR-4710, miR-5698 and miR-3160-5p) predicted the appearance of new distant metastases with an area under the curve of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.69 and specificity of 0.82. The serum levels of miR-8089 and miR-5698 were significantly associated with overall survival after the initiation of eribulin treatment. The present study provides evidence that serum miRNA profiling may serve as a biomarker for the responsiveness to eribulin and for predicting the development of new distant metastases in metastatic breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2971735609,"Leaf surface fertilization with liquid fertilizer produced from amino acids constitutes a potentially important source of nitrogen and is important for plant production. However, few reports have focused on the plant growth promotion by novel liquid fertilizers created by new amino acid resources, let alone the influence on leaf microbiota. In this study, the effects of liquid fertilizer, created by amino acids hydrolyzed from animal hairs with or without the PGPR strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9, on crop yield and leaf microbiota were investigated. The results showed that leaves sprayed with amino acid liquid fertilizer (AA) and liquid biological fertilizer (AA9) persistently increased cowpea yields compared to the control amended with chemical fertilizer (CF). Fertilization with amino acid fertilizer showed no significant difference in microbial composition compared with the CF treatment; however, the introduction of functional microbes altered the microbial composition. Pearson correlation analysis, VPA analysis and SEM models all revealed that the amino acids liquid fertilizer application, but not the functional strain or the altered microbiota, performed as the direct driver attributing to yield enhancement. We conclude that leaf fertilization with a novel amino acid liquid fertilizer can greatly enhance the crop yield and that the addition of beneficial microbes may perform the role in further altering the composition of leaf microbiota."

The precise role played by the thalamus is unknown, despite its critical role in the functioning of the cerebral cortex, and the abnormal neuronal activity of the structure in PD. Our objective was to more clearly elucidate how functional connectivity and morphology of the thalamus are impacted in PD (n = 32) compared to Controls (n = 20). To investigate functional connectivity of the thalamus we subdivided the structure into two important regions-of-interest, the first with putative connections to the motor cortices and the second with putative connections to prefrontal cortices. We then investigated potential differences in the size and shape of the thalamus in PD, and how morphology and functional connectivity relate to clinical variables. Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with increases in functional connectivity between motor subdivisions of the thalamus and the supplementary motor area, and between prefrontal thalamic subdivisions and nuclei of the basal ganglia, anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as the anterior and paracingulate gyri. These results suggest that PD is associated with increased functional connectivity of subdivisions of the thalamus which may be indicative alterations to basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2971407011,"Vinculin (Vcn) is a ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein that links transmembrane receptors to actin filaments, and plays a key role in regulating cell adhesion, motility, and force transmission. Metavinculin (MVcn) is a Vcn splice isoform that contains an additional exon encoding a 68-residue insert within the actin binding tail domain. MVcn is selectively expressed at sub-stoichiometic amounts relative to Vcn in smooth and cardiac muscle cells. Mutations in the MVcn insert are linked to various cardiomyopathies. In vitro analysis has previously shown that while both proteins can engage filamentous (F)-actin, only Vcn can promote F-actin bundling. Moreover, we and others have shown that MVcn can negatively regulate Vcn-mediated F-actin bundling in vitro. To investigate functional differences between MVcn and Vcn, we stably expressed either Vcn or MVcn in Vcn-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. While both MVcn and Vcn were observed at FAs, MVcn-expressing cells had larger but fewer focal adhesions per cell compared to Vcn-expressing cells. MVcn-expressing cells migrated faster and exhibited greater persistence compared to Vcn-expressing cells, even though Vcn-containing FAs assembled and disassembled faster. Magnetic tweezer measurements on Vcn-expressing cells show a typical cell stiffening phenotype in response to externally applied force; however, this was absent in Vcn-null and MVcn-expressing cells. Our findings that MVcn expression leads to larger but fewer FAs per cell, in conjunction with the inability of MVcn to bundle F-actin in vitro and rescue the cell stiffening response, are consistent with our previous findings of actin bundling deficient Vcn variants, suggesting that deficient actin-bundling may account for some of the differences between Vcn and MVcn."

Numerous REV7 binding partners have been identified, including the human small GTPase Ras-associated nuclear protein (RAN), which acts as a potential upstream regulator of REV7. Notably, the Shigella invasin IpaB hijacks REV7 to disrupt cell cycle control to prevent intestinal epithelial cell renewal and facilitate bacterial colonization. However, the structural details of the REV7–RAN and REV7–IpaB interactions are mostly unknown. Here, using fusion protein and rigid maltose-binding protein tagging strategies, we determined the crystal structures of these two complexes at 2.00–2.35 Å resolutions. The structures revealed that both RAN and IpaB fragments bind the “safety belt” region of REV7, inducing rearrangement of the C-terminal β-sheet region of REV7, conserved among REV7-related complexes. Of note, the REV7-binding motifs of RAN and IpaB each displayed some unique interactions with REV7 despite sharing consensus residues. Structural alignments revealed that REV7 has an adaptor region within the safety belt region that can rearrange secondary structures to fit a variety of different ligands. Our structural and biochemical results further indicated that REV7 preferentially binds GTP-bound RAN, implying that a GTP/GDP-bound transition of RAN may serve as the molecular switch that controls REV7’s activity.

https://openalex.org/W3103398559,"Quasars, which are exceptionally bright objects at the centres (or nuclei) of galaxies, are thought to be produced through the accretion of gas into disks surrounding supermassive black holes1–3. There is observational evidence at galactic and circumnuclear scales4 that gas flows inwards towards accretion disks around black holes, and such an inflow has been measured at the scale of the dusty torus that surrounds the central accretion disk5. At even smaller scales, inflows close to an accretion disk have been suggested to explain the results of recent modelling of the response of gaseous broad emission lines to continuum variations6,7. However, unambiguous observations of inflows that actually reach accretion disks have been elusive. Here we report the detection of redshifted broad absorption lines of hydrogen and helium atoms in a sample of quasars. The lines show broad ranges of Doppler velocities that extend continuously from zero to redshifts as high as about 5,000 kilometres per second. We interpret this as the inward motion of gases at velocities comparable to freefall speeds close to the black hole, constraining the fastest infalling gas to within 10,000 gravitational radii of the black hole (the gravitational radius being the gravitational constant multiplied by the object mass, divided by the speed of light squared). Extensive photoionization modelling yields a characteristic radial distance of the inflow of approximately 1,000 gravitational radii, possibly overlapping with the outer accretion disk. Observations of highly redshifted broad absorption lines of helium and hydrogen atoms provide unambiguous evidence of fast infalling gas that is merging into an accretion disk around a black hole."

Many factors condition the selection process from the characteristics of the sport discipline to financial limitations, including a long list of restrictions associated with the environment of the competitions in which the team takes part. All of this makes the process of selecting a roster of players very complex, as it is affected by multiple variables and in many cases marked by a great deal of subjectivity. The purpose of this article was to objectively select the players for a basketball team using an evolutionary algorithm, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) that uses stochastic search methods based on the imitation of natural biological evolution. The sample was composed of the players from the teams competing in the top Spanish basketball league, the Association of Basketball Clubs (ACB). To assess the quality of the solutions obtained, the results were compared with the teams in the ACB playing in the same competition as the players used in the study. The results make it possible to obtain different solutions for composing teams rendering financial resources profitable and taking into account the restrictions of the competition and of each sport management."
https://openalex.org/W2971417618,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), so-called ‘drones’, have been widely used to monitor wild animals. Here, we tested a UAV with red, green, and blue (RGB) and thermal cameras to detect free-living birds in a high Arctic region in North Greenland and in a restricted area in the Republic of Korea. Small flocks of molting pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) near sea ice and incubating common ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) in the Arctic environment were chosen for the RGB and thermal image studies. From the acquired images, we built mosaicked RGB images and coregistered thermal images, and estimated the animal shapes. Our results showed that geese were discriminated in both RGB and thermal images with water and sea ice backgrounds. Incubating plover bodies were not distinguished in RGB images due to their cryptic coloration, but they were detected in thermal images with cold background areas in the Arctic environment. We further conducted a blind survey in a restricted area under military control in Korea near the breeding sites of black-faced spoonbill (Platalea minor), which is an endangered species. From UAV flights with RGB and thermal cameras operated out of the restricted area, we acquired images of white objects in the mudflats and verified that the objects were resting spoonbills by watching the birds. We suggest that thermal cameras and UAVs can be applied to monitor animals in extreme environments and in restricted areas and help researchers find cryptic wader nests."
https://openalex.org/W2971542641,"The incidence of heatstroke has been increasing. Heatstroke has been shown to affect physiological barrier functions. However, there are few studies of the effect of heat stress on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. In this study, we investigated the influence of heat stress on brain microvascular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. Heatstroke model mice administered Texas Red-dextran showed leakage outside the brain vessel walls. In addition, trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) value was significantly reduced in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress by reducing claudin-5 expression. In addition, our results showed that the expression level of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was increased in iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells under heat stress. Furthermore, serum from heatstroke model mice could impair the BBB integrity of iPS cell-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells. These results suggest that BBB integrity was affected by heat stress in vivo and in vitro and provide important insights into the development of new therapeutic strategies for heatstroke patients."

We aimed to characterize patterns of cardiovascular risk across subgroups of AF patients by sex and race/ethnicity, since doing so may provide opportunities to identify interventions. We also evaluated whether these patterns changed over time.We utilized administrative claims data from the Optum Clinformatics® Datamart database from 2009 to 2015. Patients with AF with ≥6 months of enrollment prior to the first non-valvular AF diagnosis were included in the analysis. Final analysis utilized Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cardiovascular outcomes stratified by sex and race/ethnicity. An additional analysis stratified outcomes by calendar year of AF diagnosis to evaluate changes in outcomes over time.In a cohort of 380,636 AF patients, women had a higher risk of ischemic stroke [HR (95% CI): 1.25 (1.19, 1.31)] and lower risk of heart failure and myocardial infarction [HR (95% CI): 0.91 (0.88, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.77, 0.86), respectively)] compared to men. Black patients had elevated risk across all endpoints compared to whites, while Hispanics and Asian Americans showed no significant differences in any outcome compared to white patients. These sex and race/ethnic differences did not change over time.We found sex and race/ethnic differences in risk of cardiovascular outcomes among AF patients, without evidence of improvement over time."
https://openalex.org/W2971814075,"In this study, a new type of N2-inhibitor-water mist (NIWM) technology was proposed to resolve the problem of fire prevention and extinguishing in the goaf of coal mine. The corresponding equipment was designed and manufactured. Under the condition that both gas pressure and liquid pressure were 0.5-2MPa, the NIWM equipment produced the water mist with Sauter mean diameter (SMD) range of 166-265μm. The experimental results of the operating parameters of NIWM equipment were in agreement with the theoretical derivation. The theory of two-phase flow atomisation can be used as theoretical guide for this technology. After that, on the basis of the NIWM equipment, the experiments of inhibiting low temperature (30-100°C) oxidation and extinguishing high temperature combustion of large dosage of coal sample were carried out. Water mist with SMD = 188μm had good diffusivity in the container. The inhibiting effect of N2-inhibitor-water mist on low temperature oxidation of coal was obviously greater than that of single material. N2-water mist extinguished the burning coal completely in 20 minutes. The addition of water mist solved the shortcoming of poor cooling effect of N2. In different stages of coal-oxygen reaction, N2, inhibitor and water mist play very different role in controlling the process of coal-oxygen reaction, which was not simple accumulation of the three. The combination of N2, inhibitor and water mist should be determined according to the state of the coal mine goaf fire. On the basis of the research conclusions, the onsite arrangement diagram of the NIWM fire prevention and extinguishing equipment in the goaf was designed. The research results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of this technology, and it is of great significance to the prevention and control of coal spontaneous combustion in goaf."
https://openalex.org/W2971791019,"Background Randomized clinical trials compare participants receiving an experimental intervention to participants receiving standard of care (SOC). If one could predict the outcome for participants receiving SOC, a trial could be designed where all participants received the experimental intervention, with the observed outcome of the experimental group compared to the prediction for those individuals. Methods We used the CancerMath calculator to predict outcomes for participants in two large clinical trials of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: NSABPB15 and CALGB9344. NSABPB15 was the training set, and we used the modified algorithm to predict outcomes for two groups from CALGB9344: one which received standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy and one which received paclitaxel in addition. We made a prediction for each individual CALGB9344 participant, assuming each received only SOC. Results The predicted outcome for the group which received only SOC matched what was observed in the CALGB9344 trial. In contrast, the predicted outcome for the group also receiving paclitaxel was significantly worse than what was observed for this group. This matches the conclusion of CALGB9344 that adding paclitaxel to SOC improves survival. Conclusion This project proves that a statistical model can predict the outcome of clinical trial participants treated with SOC. In some circumstances, a predictive model could be used instead of a control arm, allowing all participants to receive experimental treatment. Predictive models for cancer and other diseases could be constructed using the vast amount of outcomes data available to the federal government, and made available for public use."

Among the organisms encoding both pykA and pykF that have been characterized to date, PykF is usually the dominant isoform. The PykA and PykF isozymes have been especially well-studied in the Enterobacteriaceae, and are distinguished by being differentially regulated and cladistically distinct (at a sequence level). For example, PykF isozymes are typically activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (8Waygood E.B. Mort J.S. Sanwal B.D. The control of pyruvate kinase of Escherichia coli: binding of substrate and allosteric effectors to the enzyme activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.Biochemistry. 1976; 15 (764863): 277-28210.1021/bi00647a006Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas PykA is activated by adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP) (9Waygood E.B.

The pathogen is intrinsically resistant to most clinically-used antibiotics (12Williamson K.S. Richards L.A. Perez-Osorio A.C. Pitts B. McInnerney K. Stewart P.S. Franklin M.J.

Phibbs P.V. Alternative pathways of carbohydrate utilization in Pseudomonads.Annu. Rev.

As a consequence, PK is likely to be the major site of glycolytic flux regulation in this organism. P. aeruginosa encodes two uncharacterized PK isozymes, annotated as pykA (PA4329) and pykF (PA1498). Here, we show that in contrast with most organisms encoding both PK isozymes, in P. aeruginosa, PykA plays the dominant physiological role. We also present the first structure of a PykA isozyme. Surprisingly, this structure revealed that glucose 6-phosphate binds in a site distinct to that observed for the M. tuberculosis enzyme. P. aeruginosa encodes two PK isozymes: PykA (PA4329, 58% amino acid identity with Escherichia coli PykA) and PykF (PA1498, 37% amino acid identity with E. coli PykF). An alignment of selected relevant PykA and PykF sequences is shown in Fig. S1. Phylogenetic classification of P. aeruginosa PykA and PykF (Fig. S2) indicates that the isozymes belong to two distinct subclasses of PK. To establish which isozyme is dominant in P. aeruginosa, we measured the PK activity in cell extracts of mutants defective in pykA, pykF, or pykA and pykF together (pykA pykF). Following growth on minimal medium containing glucose, glycerol, or acetate as a sole carbon source, pyruvate kinase activity was >90% lower in the pykA mutant and in the pykA pykF mutant than it was in the WT control (Fig. 1). However, pyruvate kinase activity in the pykF mutant remained high on these substrates. These data indicate that PykA contributes most to PK activity in P. aeruginosa. Consistent with this, Western analyses using antibodies raised against purified P. aeruginosa PykA or PykF confirmed that the latter is essentially undetectable during growth on the carbon sources tested unless overexpressed in trans from a plasmid (Fig. 1). Note that the antibodies were preabsorbed against a pykA mutant (for the anti-PykA antibodies) or a pykF mutant (for the PykF antibodies). The absence of PykF expression in a pykA mutant led to weak cross-reactivity of the anti-PykA antibodies against shared PykA/PykF epitopes in PykF, although this was only apparent when PykF was overexpressed. We conclude that pykA is expressed at higher levels in these conditions than pykF. To explore the phenotypic consequences of pykA and pykF mutation, we assessed the growth characteristics of each mutant on different carbon sources (Fig. 1). The pykA mutant and the pykA pykF mutant grew slowly compared with the WT and the pykF mutant in minimal media containing glucose or glycerol as a sole carbon source. That there was any observable growth of these mutants at all on glucose is presumably due to the pyruvate produced at the 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase-catalyzed step of the EDP. Similarly, the slow, but nonnegligible growth in glycerol (which feeds in to the EDP after the KDPG aldolase-catalyzed step) can be rationalized by invoking operation of the recently-defined EDEMP cycle (15Nikel P.I. Chavarría M. Fuhrer T. Sauer U. de Lorenzo V. Pseudomonas putida KT2440 strain metabolizes glucose through a cycle formed by enzymes of the Entner-Doudoroff, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas, and pentose phosphate pathways.J. Biol.

The EDEMP cycle allows triose phosphates such as those derived from glycerol to be recycled through the KDPG aldolase step, thereby yielding pyruvate. Growth on glucose or glycerol was restored in the pykA mutant and the pykA pykF mutant by expression of either pykA or pykF in trans, suggesting that both isozymes have the potential to complement the pykA mutant growth defect. These data also indicate that the low PK activity in the pykA mutant is likely due to low expression of PykF, rather than low intrinsic activity of the isozyme. Consistent with this, pyruvate kinase activity increased and PykF expression became detectable during growth on glucose when pykF was expressed in trans in the pykF mutant (Fig. 1). (PykF is predicted to be part of a bicistronic operon alongside a putative glycerate kinase, PA1499. The ppykF+ complementation plasmid encoded both PA1499 and pykF, see “Materials and Methods”.) In contrast, during growth on acetate, the pykA, pykF, and pykA pykF mutants all grew at essentially the same rate as the WT. This suggests that PykA plays an important role in catabolizing substrates that feed into the EDP such as glucose and glycerol, but contributes less to growth on acetate (which does not require flux through the PK-catalyzed reaction). Purified PykA was an ∼200 kDa tetramer in solution based on analytical ultracentrifugation data (Figs. S5 and S6). At saturating phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentration, the enzyme displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to [ADP], with a Km value of 0.07 mm (Fig. 2, Table 1). In contrast, at saturating ADP concentration, the PEP-dependence was sigmoidal, with an s0.5 value of 0.67 mm (Fig. 2, Table 1) and a Hill coefficient of 2.14, indicative of positive cooperativity.Table 1The effect of metabolic regulators and monovalent ions on PykA activityNo additive0.2 mm F6P0.15 mm R5P1 mm G3P1 mm G6P1 mm KDPG0.5 mm X5P1 mm RL5P100 mm KCl100 mm NH4Cl100 mm NaClPEP titration s0.5 (mm)0.670 ± 0.0580.159 ± 0.0210.195 ± 0.0170.297 ± 0.0170.290 ± 0.0260.432 ± 0.0360.209 ± 0.0110.269 ± 0.0121.187 ± 0.0861.402 ± 0.0841.492 ± 0.116 Hill coefficient (h)2.14 ± 0.341.45 ± 0.311.65 ± 0.251.89 ± 0.211.78 ± 0.321.52 ± 0.181.87 ± 0.221.61 ± 0.122.36 ± 0.282.31 ± 0.222.42 ± 0.32 Vmax (mm/min)0.099 ± 0.0040.096 ± 0.0040.092 ± 0.0030.092 ± 0.0020.100 ± 0.0030.100 ± 0.0040.110 ± 0.0020.110 ± 0.0020.087 ± 0.0020.130 ± 0.0030.120 ± 0.004 kcat(s−1)431.9418.8401.4401.4436.3436.3479.9479.9379.6567.2523.6 kcat/s0.5(s−1 mm−1)644.12626205513481504100822861778319.8404.6350.9ADP titration Km (mm)0.070 ± 0.015NAaNA, not applicable (the regulator had no significant effect on PykA kinetics compared with the control (no additive present)).

The presence of these ions is important to facilitate binding of the substrate, transfer of the phosphoryl group from PEP to ADP, and possibly also acquisition of an active enzyme conformation (17Larsen T.M.

We found that the activity of P. aeruginosa PykA was independent of K+ concentration (Fig. 2). Indeed, addition of monovalent cations (K+, NH4+ or Na+) even somewhat decreased the overall catalytic activity of the enzyme (Fig. S7, Table 1). The K+-mediated activation of pyruvate kinase activity is known to be dependent on the nature of the residue immediately preceding strand Bβ1 in the structure (19Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. The monovalent cation requirement of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase is eliminated by substitution of lysine for glutamate 117.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348 (9434737): 262-26710.1006/abbi.1997.0448Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); in K+-dependent enzymes, this residue is a glutamate, whereas in K+-independent enzymes, it is often a lysine. In P. aeruginosa PykA, the corresponding residue is a lysine (Fig. S1). Pyruvate kinase is a major site for the regulation of glycolytic flux in many species, and most of the known regulators in other species are associated with the EMP. However, P. aeruginosa relies solely on the EDP for glycolysis. To investigate the regulation of P. aeruginosa PykA further, we screened a wide range of metabolic intermediates, guided by a knowledge of the pathways feeding in and out of the EDP, for their ability to activate or inhibit PykA in vitro. Putative regulatory molecules were screened at low PEP concentration (0.3 mm) to identify activating ligands, and high PEP concentration (3 mm) to identify inhibitory ligands (Fig. 2 and Fig. S8, respectively). More detailed kinetic analyses (s0.5, kcat) were carried out on the “hits” identified this way (Fig. 2, Fig. S9, and Table 1). No inhibitors were identified. However, PykA was strongly activated by glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) from the EDP and by intermediates from the reductive PPP (fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), ribulose 5-phosphate (RL5P), and xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P)) (Table 1). The main effect of these regulators was to decrease s0.5, suggestive of K-type allosteric regulation, and to change the substrate dependence kinetics on PEP from a sigmoidal to a hyperbolic (i.e. Michaelis-Menten) profile. Although these regulators had a large impact on the PEP-dependence of the reaction, they had little or no effect on its ADP-dependence. Interestingly, AMP and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (two well-established regulators of PK in many other species) had almost no effect on PykA activity. Currently, there is no structure available for any PykA isozyme. We were therefore fortunate to obtain crystals of PykA containing a substrate analogue (malonate) and Mg2+ bound in the active site, and a bound allosteric regulator (G6P). The crystals diffracted X-rays to 2.4 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit of PykA contained 12 polypeptides assembled into three complete homotetramers. This quaternary structure is consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation analyses data indicating that PykA is a tetramer in solution (Fig. S6).

The A domain is comprised of 8 α/β structures assembled into a TIM barrel motif. Helices Aα6 and Aα8 are further subdivided into shorter segments forming Aα6′ and Aα8′. The Aα6′helix contains part of a highly conserved segment (245MVARGDLGVE254), which plays a key role in catalysis (Fig. 3C). The active site is located in the cleft between domains A and B (Fig. 3B). Relative to the A domain, the spatial disposition of the β-rich B domain varied somewhat between the different protomers, indicating that the domain is configurationally flexible as a unit. The αβ-rich C domain contains the bound allosteric regulator, G6P. The PykA active site contains a bound substrate analogue, malonate (present in the crystallization buffer), and Mg2+ (Fig. 3C). The malonate is bound by hydrogen bonds from both the polypeptide backbone (residues Gly249 (2.8 Å) and Asp250 (3.1 Å)) and the side chains of Lys221 (2.9 Å), Thr282 (2.6 Å), and Arg34 (3.3 Å). In addition, the active site Mg2+ also contributes to malonate binding through electrostatic interactions. The Mg2+ is octahedrally coordinated through interactions with the side chains of Glu223 and Asp250, and also with two water molecules. These active site residues are absolutely conserved in all bacterial PKs (Fig. S1), as is their spatial disposition, even when comparing malonate-bound PykA with pyruvate-bound PK from rabbit muscle (PDB 1F3W) (Fig. 3D). In contrast, superposition of the PykA active site with that of E. coli apo-PykF (PDB 1PKY) reveals that almost all the residues just discussed undergo significant spatial re-orientation in the presence of the substrate, indicative of induced fit (Fig. 3E). An alignment of PykA sequences reveals that all PykA orthologues contain 3 residues not present in any of the PykF orthologues, corresponding to Ala229, Asp230, and Asp231 in P. aeruginosa PykA (Fig. S1). The presence of these three additional residues lengthens the loop connecting Aα5-Aβ5 resulting in the displacement of helix Aα5 away from the core of the enzyme (Fig. S10). The functional significance of this is not yet clear, although it is worth noting that the same loop of structure contributes two key residues to the active site: Glu223 and Lys221 (Fig. S10). Kinetic analysis indicated that G6P is an activator of PykA, increasing the apparent catalytic efficiency (kcat/s0.5) of the enzyme around 3-fold (Table 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. S9). Inspection of the PykA structure revealed a molecule of G6P buried in each C-domain, far from the active site, indicating that G6P is an allosteric regulator (Fig. 3B). The structure of only one other bacterial PK with bound regulator has been solved, and that is the PykF family enzyme from M. tuberculosis (Mtb). A comparison of the allosteric binding site(s) observed in the Mtb enzyme reveals AMP bound in the same location as the G6P in P. aeruginosa PykA. The Mtb enzyme does bind G6P, but the ligand is located in an entirely different position in the allosteric cleft (PDB 5WSB) (Fig. 4A). The G6P-binding pocket in PykA is comprised of two loops: a “phosphate loop” and a “ring loop.” The phosphate loop (Cβ1-Cα2, residues 383–388) and partly the Cα2 helix (Thr389) binds the phosphate group of the ligand, whereas the ring loop (Cβ4-Cβ5, residues 460–471) anchors the hexose ring moiety. Superposition of the G6P-binding site in PykA with the PykF apo-enzyme (PDB 1PKY) from E. coli reveals that in the presence of G6P, the ring loop of PykA is pulled tightly over the allosteric pocket (Fig. 4B), whereas the phosphate loop shares a similar disposition in both structures. The movement of the ring loop in the presence of G6P causes a shift and partial unwinding of the Cα4 helix in PykA. The bound G6P interacts with the surrounding residues through a network of hydrogen bonds involving both the phosphate group and the sugar ring hydroxyls (Fig. 4C). In addition, occupation of the allosteric site also appears to promote secondary interactions between the phosphate loop and the ring loop of PykA; Ser386 and Thr389 on the phosphate loop form hydrogen bonds with Gln467 and Thr470 on the ring loop, respectively. Interestingly, Lys460 and Tyr464 on the ring loop also interact, tightening up closure of the binding pocket (Fig. 4D). This may be unique to the PK subclass represented by P. aeruginosa PykA, because its ring loop is less well-conserved than the ring loop in other PykA enzymes (Fig. S1). Furthermore, half of the residues that mediate the interaction between the phosphate and the ring loops are unique to P. aeruginosa PykA (Lys460, Tyr464, and Gln467). Comparison of the G6P-bound PykA structure with the E. coli apo-PykF structure (PDB 1PKY) revealed differences in the disposition of residues at the protomer interfaces. The PykA tetramer contains four inter-protomer interfaces, two of which are between adjacent A-domains (A-A interface) and two between adjacent C-domains (C-C interface) (Fig. 3A). The A-A interface (∼1450 Å2) is formed through pairing of Aα6, Aα6′, Aα7, Aα8, loop Aα6-Aα6′, loop Aα7-Aβ7, and loop Aα8-Cα1 from one protomer with the same secondary structural units (albeit, with inverted symmetry) on the second protomer (Fig. S11). By contrast, the apo-structure of PykF does not include Aα6′ or loop Aα8-Cα1 as parts of the interface and instead, there is an Aα7-Aα7 interaction that is absent in PykA (Fig. 5A). The A-A interface in PykA is very close to the active site, so structural changes at the interface affect the disposition of active site residues including Arg248, Gly249, Glu283, Asp250, and Thr282 (Fig. S12). Indeed, the main chain amide nitrogen of Gly249 is directly involved in binding the substrate analogue, whereas the amide carbonyl moiety of this residue forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg296 on helix Aα7 on the adjacent protomer (Fig. 5C). The A-A interface is stabilized by just two salt bridges (Fig. S13), which contrasts with the situation seen in E. coli apo-PykF, where most of the interactions at the A-A involve salt bridges. Comparison of G6P-bound PykA with apo-PykF (PDB 1PKY) also reveals major differences at the C-C interface (Fig. 5B). The C-C interface in PykF is comprised of Cα4, Cβ5, and the ring loop between Cβ4 and Cβ5. By contrast, the C-C interface in PykA is comprised of Cβ5, the ring loop, Cα1, and the long, flexible loop between Aα8-Cα1. Essentially, the bound G6P in PykA displaces the ring loop and Cα4, resulting in an outward movement of Cα1. This drags the Aα8-Cα1 loop region closer toward the C-C interface (Fig. 5, E and F). This movement of the Aα8-Cα1 loop could, in turn, communicate the conformational change from the G6P-binding site to the A-A interface and the active site, providing a plausible mechanism by which the allosteric regulator elicits its effect. Consistent with its role as the major PK isozyme in P. aeruginosa, a pykA mutant was defective in growth on glucose and glycerol. These data raise the question of why P. aeruginosa encodes two distinct PK isozymes? This is intriguing, especially given that the gene encoding one of the isozymes (pykF) appeared to show negligible expression under any of the growth conditions tested. One likely solution is that pykF appears to be part of a larger cluster of genes (PA1498–PA1502) that may be involved in the catabolism of compounds such as ethylene glycol (20Franden M.A. Jayakody L.N. Li W.-J. Wagner N.J. Cleveland N.S. Michener W.E. Hauer B. Blank L.M. Wierckx N. Klebensberger J. Beckham G.T. Engineering Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for efficient ethylene glycol utilization.Metab. Eng. 2018; 48 (29885475): 197-20710.1016/j.ymben.2018.06.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Therefore, although artificially expressed pykF is capable of rescuing the growth defect associated with the pykA mutant (Fig. 1), its expression is likely to be induced only under very select conditions. P. aeruginosa lacks phosphofructokinase (encoded by pfk) and is therefore incapable of carrying out the EMP pathway of glycolysis (13Lessie T.G. Phibbs P.V. Alternative pathways of carbohydrate utilization in Pseudomonads.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1984; 38 (6388497): 359-38810.1146/annurev.mi.38.100184.002043Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Instead, and in common with around 13% of species for which a genome sequence is available, it is exclusively reliant on the EDP for glucose oxidation (21Flamholz A. Noor E. Bar-Even A.

DBA/2 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA to generate an experimental model of malaria-associated ALI/ARDS. The infected mice were divided into 2 groups based on the histopathological study of lung tissues: those with and those without ALI/ARDS. The expression of the SphK-1 and S1PR-3 proteins in the lung tissues was investigated using immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. In addition, the S1P level was quantified in plasma and lung tissues using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results demonstrated that the cellular expression of the SphK-1 and S1PR-3 proteins was significantly upregulated in endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages in the lung tissues of malaria-infected mice with ALI/ARDS compared with those in the control groups. The increased expression of the SphK-1 and S1PR-3 proteins was confirmed using Western blot analysis. The concentration of S1P in plasma and lung tissues was significantly decreased in malaria-infected mice with ALI/ARDS compared with non-ALI/ARDS and control mice. Furthermore, increased expression of the SphK-1 and S1PR-3 proteins significantly correlated with lung injury scores and S1P concentrations in malaria-infected mice with ALI/ARDS. These findings highlight increased expression of SphK-1 and S1PR-3 in the lung tissues of malaria-infected mice with ALI/ARDS."

Here, we focused on cell movement where current and/or past cell shape can influence the future cell movement. We demonstrate that CNNs prospectively predicted the future direction of cell movement with high accuracy from a single image patch of a cell at a certain time. Furthermore, by visualizing the image features that were learned by the CNNs, we could identify morphological features, e.g., the protrusions and trailing edge that have been experimentally reported to determine the direction of cell movement. Our results indicate that CNNs have the potential to predict the future direction of cell movement from current cell shape, and can be used to automatically identify those morphological features that influence future cell movement."

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the distribution of HPV genotypes in HIV-infected women living in French Antilles and Guiana and to determine HIV-related characteristics associated with HPV infection. This cross-sectional study included 439 HIV-infected women who were followed between January 2011 and May 2014. Variables related to HIV infections were collected, and cervical samples were analysed to determine HPV genotypes. The median age of the population was 46 years. Estimated prevalence of HPV and high-risk (HR)-HPV infection were 50.1% IC95 [45.4-54.7] and 42% IC95 [37.3-46.6], respectively. HR-HPV 16, 52, 53 or intermediate risk-HPV-68 were found in 25% to 30% of the HPV-infected patients. Gynaecological screening revealed abnormal cervical smear in 24% and 42% of HR-HPV-negative and HPV-positive women, respectively (p = 0.003). Approximately 90% of women were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Demographic characteristics associated with a higher prevalence of HPV infection included alcohol consumption. Regarding HIV-related characteristics, current therapy on ART, its duration, and undetectable plasma concentrations of RNA-HIV1 were associated with a lower risk of HPV infection. Infection rate with HR-HPV was higher than what is commonly reported in HIV-negative women worldwide and was more likely in women with incomplete HIV suppression. These results highlight the need for supporting adherence to ART, cervical cytology, HPV testing and HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2971563101,"Inducing unconsciousness in fish using electrical stunning prior to slaughter may improve fish welfare and fillet quality if such practises can be disseminated into wild capture fisheries. The objectives of this study were to: 1) evaluate if an established slaughter protocol consisting of dry electrical stunning (using a coupled AC/DC current at ≈ 110 Vrms) followed by chilling could be used to stun the wild captured species Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) unconscious within 0.5 s; 2) determine if death could be induced without consciousness recovery by longer duration stunning (5 s) combined with chilling in an ice/water slurry for 6 min; and 3) examine the extent of quality defects arising from the applied slaughter protocol. We determined consciousness by examination of behavioural responses in a standardised vitality assessment. Out of a sample of 10 mackerel, 9 were assumed to be rendered unconscious by the 0.5 s stun, as determined by the presence of tonic and/or clonic muscle cramping consistent with a general epileptic insult. Assumed unconsciousness was maintained throughout chilling treatment in all fish (n = 25) following a full stun of 5 s. All fish were assumed to have died as a result of the protocol. There was no evidence of spinal damage or haematoma quality defects post filleting. These results suggest that the examined protocol is effective at slaughtering mackerel in a manner consistent with good welfare and without inducing quality defects, but further research is required to verify the unconscious condition via electroencephalogram (EEG) and before the procedure can be applied in wild capture fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2971713441,"Destruction of the cartilage matrix in joints is an important feature of arthritis. Proteolytic degradation of cartilage glycoproteins can contribute to the loss of matrix integrity. Human inter-α-inhibitor (IαI), which stabilizes the extracellular matrix, is composed of the light-chain serine proteinase inhibitor bikunin and two homologous heavy chains (HC1 and HC2) covalently linked through chondroitin 4-sulfate. Inflammation promotes the transfer of HCs from chondroitin 4-sulfate to hyaluronan by tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6). This reaction generates a covalent complex between the heavy chains and hyaluronan that can promote leukocyte invasion. This study demonstrates that both IαI and the HC-hyaluronan complex are substrates for the extracellular matrix proteases ADAMTS-5 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) -3, -7, and -13. The major cleavage sites for all four proteases are found in the C terminus of HC2. ADAMTS-5 and MMP-7 displayed the highest activity toward HC2. ADAMTS-5 degradation products were identified in mass spectrometric analysis of 29 of 33 arthropathic patients, indicating that ADAMTS-5 cleavage occurs in synovial fluid in arthritis. After cleavage, free HC2, together with TSG-6, is able to catalyze the transfer of heavy chains to hyaluronan. The release of extracellular matrix bound HC2 is likely to increase the mobility of the HC2/TSG-6 catalytic unit and consequently increase the rate of the HC transfer reaction. Ultimately, ADAMTS-5 cleavage of HC2 could alter the physiological and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix and contribute to the progression of arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2971810203,"B7-1 proteins are routinely expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) and within the innate immune system. They function to establish a biologically optimal and dynamic balance between immune activation and inhibition or self-tolerance. Interactions between B7-1 and its receptors, which include CD28, CTLA4 and PD-L1, contribute to both stimulatory as well as inhibitory or homeostatic regulation. In the current study, we investigated whether the tumor-promoting actions of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) disrupted this equilibrium in pancreatic cancer to promote malignant progression and an enhanced means to evade immune detection. The data show that B7-1 is (i) upregulated following treatment of pancreatic carcinoma cells with TGF-β; (ii) induced by TGF-β via both Smad2/3-dependent and independent pathways; (iii) required for pancreatic tumor cell in vitro migration/invasion; and (iv) necessary for TGF-β regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through induction of Snail family members. Results from the proposed studies provide valuable insights into mechanisms whereby TGF-β regulates both the innate immune response and intrinsic properties of pancreatic tumor growth."

Both LCK and ITK consist of multiple domains, including one SH2 and one SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain (12Smith C.I. Islam T.C. Mattsson P.T. Mohamed A.J. Nore B.F. Vihinen M. The Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases: mammalian Btk, Bmx, Itk, Tec, Txk and homologs in other species.Bioessays. 2001; 23 (11340625): 436-44610.1002/bies.1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). SH3 domains are regions of ∼60–70 amino acids (aa) present in many signaling molecules. The general structure of this domain consists of two short anti-parallel β-sheets packed against each other, resulting in a fold with a relatively flat hydrophobic surface containing at least one conserved aromatic (often a tryptophan) residue (13Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Modular peptide recognition domains in eukaryotic signaling.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26 (9241420): 259-28810.1146/annurev.biophys.26.1.259Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). SH3 domains bind to PRRs that can contain the prototypic SH3-binding motif PXXP belonging to one of two classes. Class I motifs have the consensus sequence +pΨPpΨP, and class II motifs have the consensus sequence ΨPpΨPp+. Ψ represents an aliphatic residue, + indicates a basic residue, uppercase positions are conserved residues that contact the SH3 domain and provide the specificity, and lowercase residues represent scaffolding positions, usually prolines (14Tran T. Hoffmann S. Wiesehan K. Jonas E. Luge C. Aladag A. Willbold D. Insights into human Lck SH3 domain binding specificity: different binding modes of artificial and native ligands.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (16274251): 15042-1505210.1021/bi051403kCrossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Ligand orientation is generally determined by the position of the basic residue, often an arginine, relative to the core proline residues (15Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Two binding orientations for peptides to the Src SH3 domain: development of a general model for SH3-ligand interactions.Science. 1994; 266 (7526465): 1241-124710.1126/science.7526465Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). We have previously mapped the interaction site of ITK on TSAD and showed that ITK binds with its SH3 domain to the PRR of TSAD (aa 239–274) (10Berge T. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Andersen T.C.

Interaction of TSAD with ITK promoted LCK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of ITK as well as migration of T cells upon CXCL12 stimulation. T cells lacking TSAD failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of ITK as well as migration of T cells upon CXCL12 stimulation (10Berge T. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Andersen T.C. Holthe G.B. Claesson-Welsh L. Andreotti A.H. Inngjerdingen M. Spurkland A.

Whereas ITK interacts with TSAD exclusively through its SH3 domain (10Berge T. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Andersen T.C. Holthe G.B. Claesson-Welsh L. Andreotti A.H. Inngjerdingen M. Spurkland A. T cell specific adapter protein (TSAD) interacts with Tec kinase ITK to promote CXCL12 induced migration of human and murine T cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20305788): e976110.1371/journal.pone.0009761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), LCK interacts with TSAD through both its SH3 and its SH2 domain (17Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Mustelin T. Andersen T.C. Berge T. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. Spurkland A. Lea T. The C terminus of T cell-specific adapter protein (TSAD) is necessary for TSAD-mediated inhibition of Lck activity.Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35 (15827961): 1612-162010.1002/eji.200425638Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, promotion of LCK-mediated phosphorylation of ITK by TSAD could be either due to simultaneous docking and interaction of LCK and ITK on TSAD or simply due to binding of LCK to TSAD activating LCK catalytic activity, thus facilitating phosphorylation of ITK. In an effort to begin to understand the molecular details defining the association of TSAD, LCK, and ITK, we performed peptide array binding experiments, biochemical analyses, and 2D (1H, 15N) heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR experiments to examine the interaction between TSAD, ITK SH3, and LCK SH3. Our data support a model whereby LCK and ITK are both recruited to TSAD via their SH3 domains, allowing LCK-mediated phosphorylation of ITK. Our results point to a complex protein assembly, where the ITK SH3 and LCK SH3 domains can both compete for and simultaneously bind to adjacent binding sites on TSAD encompassing aa 242–268. Our findings also suggest that, once active, ITK autophosphorylation of its own SH3 domain disrupts the ITK/TSAD interaction, possibly creating an open binding site on TSAD for recruiting and activation of another ITK molecule by LCK. Expression of the adapter molecule TSAD (Fig. 1A) is induced in human T cells upon TCR triggering (9Sundvold V. Torgersen K.M. Post N.H. Marti F. King P.D. Røttingen J.A. Spurkland A. Lea T. T cell-specific adapter protein inhibits T cell activation by modulating Lck activity.J.

Murine TSAD was first cloned as an ITK/RLK interaction partner; thus, an alternative designation for TSAD is RLK/ITK-binding protein (RIBP) (7Rajagopal K. Sommers C.L. Decker D.C. Mitchell E.O. Korthauer U. Sperling A.I. Kozak C.A. Love P.E. Bluestone J.A. RIBP, a novel Rlk/Txk- and itk-binding adaptor protein that regulates T cell activation.J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190 (10587356): 1657-166810.1084/jem.190.11.1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following up on this observation, we have previously found that the interaction of TSAD with ITK depends on the PRR of TSAD (10Berge T. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Andersen T.C. Holthe G.B. Claesson-Welsh L. Andreotti A.H. Inngjerdingen M. Spurkland A. T cell specific adapter protein (TSAD) interacts with Tec kinase ITK to promote CXCL12 induced migration of human and murine T cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20305788): e976110.1371/journal.pone.0009761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), indicating a role for the ITK SH3 domain in mediating this interaction. To reveal whether an intact ITK SH3 domain is required for interaction of ITK with TSAD, we expressed full-length Myc-tagged ITK constructs in 293T cells and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of ITK led to co-immunoprecipitation of TSAD only in the presence of WT ITK, whereas ITK containing the W208K mutation, which is known to abolish binding of the ITK SH3 domain to its ligands (18Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J. Berg L.J. Identification of Itk/Tsk Src homology 3 domain ligands.J. Biol.

We previously also showed that TSAD promotes LCK-mediated phosphorylation of ITK on Tyr511 (10Berge T. Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Andersen T.C. Holthe G.B. Claesson-Welsh L. Andreotti A.H. Inngjerdingen M. Spurkland A. T cell specific adapter protein (TSAD) interacts with Tec kinase ITK to promote CXCL12 induced migration of human and murine T cells.PLoS One. 2010; 5 (20305788): e976110.1371/journal.pone.0009761Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event activates the ITK kinase and leads to autophosphorylation of ITK Tyr180 in the ITK SH3 domain (19Wilcox H.M. Berg L.J. Itk phosphorylation sites are required for functional activity in primary T cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278 (12842872): 37112-3712110.1074/jbc.M304811200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the specificity of ITK SH3 for its ligands may be altered by Tyr180 phosphorylation (20Joseph R.E. Fulton D.B. Andreotti A.H. Mechanism and functional significance of Itk autophosphorylation.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373 (17897671): 1281-129210.1016/j.jmb.2007.08.060Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To examine whether binding of ITK SH3 to TSAD was affected by phosphorylation of ITK Tyr180, we generated Tyr → Phe and Tyr → Glu mutated versions of the ITK SH3 domain. Both the ITK SH3 Y180F and the Y180E mutant proteins displayed significantly reduced interaction with TSAD compared with the WT ITK SH3 domain (Fig. 1, C and D). Also, compared with the ITK SH3 Y180F mutant, the Y180E mutant, where the negative charge and the size of the glutamate in the ITK-Y180E mutant may mimic ITK phosphorylated (p)Tyr180, displayed significantly reduced binding to TSAD (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data show that interaction of TSAD with ITK is mediated by ITK SH3; furthermore, they suggest that the physiological association between the two molecules is regulated by the phosphorylation status of ITK. Having established that ITK SH3 binds to TSAD, we performed in silico motif analysis (https://scansite4.mit.edu/4.0/#home) 4Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

This analysis revealed possible ITK SH3–binding sites at TSAD Pro263 and Pro247 (Fig. 2A). TSAD Pro247 was also indicated as a potential SRC-SH3 interaction site (data not shown). We then went on to dissect the interaction between the ITK SH3 domain and the PRR of TSAD compared with that of the LCK SH3 domain, which is known to bind to TSAD (17Sundvold-Gjerstad V. Granum S. Mustelin T. Andersen T.C. Berge T. Shapiro M.J. Shapiro V.S. Spurkland A. Lea T.

Immunol. 2005; 35 (15827961): 1612-162010.1002/eji.200425638Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A series of 14 overlapping peptides of 20 aa with a sliding window of three aa was synthesized and fixed onto a cellulose membrane. This peptide array covered most of the PRR of TSAD (aa 233–291) (Fig. 2B). The membrane was probed with recombinant GST-ITK SH3 and GST-LCK SH3 domains and immunoblotted with anti-GST and anti-mouse-HRP antibodies. The results show that ITK SH3 and LCK SH3 domains bind to overlapping peptides in the PRR of TSAD. However, the peptide array blotting analysis indicates that ITK SH3 prefers a binding site that is C-terminal relative to that preferred by LCK SH3 (Fig. 2A). The mutant ITK SH3 domain W208K (ITK-K) did not bind to any of the TSAD peptides. The motif formed by the TSAD sequence flanking Pro263 (PΨPXXRP) is also found in the ITK SH3-binding motifs of SLP-76 and in CBL-B (18Bunnell S.C. Henry P.A. Kolluri R. Kirchhausen T. Rickles R.J.

Mutation of either Pro247 or Pro263 to alanine did not significantly abolish binding of ITK SH3 to TSAD in pulldown experiments (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that more than one amino acid in these regions is involved in binding to the ITK SH3 domain. Consistent with the presence of two ITK SH3 interaction sites on TSAD within aa 239–273 (Fig. 2, A and B), we found that a deletion mutant of TSAD lacking both the Pro247 and the Pro263 motifs (TSAD Δ239–274) displayed minimal binding to ITK SH3 (Fig. 2, E (lane 3) and F) as has been shown previously (10Berge T.

In contrast, separate deletion constructs encompassing either Pro247 or Pro263, TSAD Δ239–256 and TSAD Δ257–274, respectively, both retained some binding to ITK SH3 (Figs. 1A and 2E (lanes 4 and 5)). The deletion construct lacking Pro263 (TSAD Δ257–274) showed a significantly greater reduction in binding ITK SH3 compared with TSAD Δ239–256 (Fig. 2F).Table 1Verified and putative ITK SH3 motifsProteinSequence motifReferenceTSADQLPPEVYTIPVPRHRPAThis paperSLP-76DRPPSGKTPQQPPVPPQRPMARef. 23Bunnell S.C.

Mutation of Pro263 to Ala263 in TSAD Δ239–256 resulted in significantly reduced interaction of ITK SH3 with TSAD. Also, the corresponding Pro247 to Ala247 mutation in TSAD Δ257–274 conferred reduced interaction with ITK SH3; however, the difference failed to reach statistical significance (Fig. 2, G and H). Taken together, we therefore hypothesized that the interaction of TSAD Pro263 with ITK SH3 was the most likely to be of biological relevance and hence set out to analyze this interaction in further detail using NMR spectroscopy. We determined the NMR resonance assignments (deposited as BMRB entry 18119) and three-dimensional structure of the human ITK SH3 domain (PDB entry 2LMJ) using standard methods (24Cavanagh J.

https://openalex.org/W2971938739,"Security breaches of digital information represent a significant threat to the wellbeing of individuals, corporations, and governments in the digital era. Roughly 50% of breaches of information security result from the actions of individuals inside organizations (i.e., insider threat), and some evidence indicates that common deterrence programs may not lessen the insiders’ intention to violate information security. This had led researchers to investigate contextual and individual difference variables that influence the intention to violate information security policies. The current research builds upon previous studies and explores the relationship between individual differences in self-control and moral potency and the neural correlates of decision making in the context of information security. The behavioral data revealed that individuals were sensitive to the severity of a violation of information security, and that the measures of self-control and moral potency were reliable indicators of the underlying constructs. The ERP data provided a partial replication of previous research, revealing differences in neural activity for scenarios describing security violations relative to control stimuli over the occipital, medial and lateral frontal, and central regions of the scalp. Brain-behavior analyses showed that higher moral potency was associated with a decrease in neural activity, while higher self-control was associated with an increase in neural activity; and that moral potency and self-control tended to have independent influences on neural recruitment related to considering violations of information security. These findings lead to the suggestion that enhancing moral potency and self-control could represent independent pathways to guarding against insider threat."
https://openalex.org/W2971993815,"Recent findings have suggested an association between pubic hair grooming and self-reported history of sexually transmitted infection (STI), specifically gonococcal infection (GC), chlamydial infection (CT), or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We evaluated the association between self-reported extreme grooming and laboratory-confirmed prevalence of GC/CT. Between April 2017 and April 2018, we enrolled English-speaking, adult, female students at a large, Midwestern university who presented on-campus for STI testing. Participants completed a questionnaire on demographics and sexual and grooming behaviors, which was linked to their GC/CT test results based on nucleic acid amplification testing. We defined extreme grooming as removal of all pubic hair either at least weekly in the past 12 months or ≥6 times in the past 30 days. We used two separate logistic regression models to determine whether odds of GC/CT varied by extreme groomer status for either time interval. In the study sample of 214 women, prevalence of GC/CT was 9.8%. Nearly all participants (98.1%) reported ever grooming; 53.6% were extreme groomers in the past year and 18% in the past month. Extreme grooming was not associated with prevalent GC/CT in the past year (odds ratio [OR] = 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3–1.9; adjusted OR = 0.7; 95% CI: 0.3–2.0) or in the past month (OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.1–2.0; aOR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1–1.9). Pubic hair grooming was common among female university students attending for STI testing. Findings do not support pubic hair grooming as an STI risk factor in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2972165739,"Similarity between targets and distracters is a key factor in generating distractibility, and exerts a large detrimental effect on aging. The present EEG study tested the role of a new stimulus dimension in generating distractibility in visual Working Memory (vWM), namely numerical similarity. In a change detection paradigm a varying number of relevant and irrelevant stimuli were presented simultaneously in opposite hemifields. Behavioral results indicated that young participants outperformed older individuals; however, in both groups numerical similarity per se did not modulate performance. At the electrophysiological level, in young participants the Contralateral Delay Activity (CDA, a proxy for item maintenance in vWM) was modulated by the numerosity of the relevant items regardless of numerical similarity. In older participants, the CDA was modulated by target numerosity only in the same numerical condition, where the total number of (relevant and irrelevant) items increased with increasing target numerosities. No effect was present in the dissimilar numerical condition, where the total number of items did not vary substantially across target numerosity. This pattern was suggestive of an age-related effect of the total number of (relevant and irrelevant) items on vWM. The additional analyses on alpha-band lateralization measures support this interpretation by revealing that older adults lacked selective deployment of attentional and vWM resources towards the relevant hemifield. Overall, the results indicate that, while numerical similarity does not modulate distractibility, there is an age-related redistribution of vWM resources across the two visual fields, ultimately leading to a general decrease in task performance of older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2972094456,"Inherited bleeding disorders including abnormalities of platelet number and function rarely occur in a variety of dog breeds, but are probably underdiagnosed. Genetically characterized canine forms of platelet disorders provide valuable large animal models for understanding similar platelet disorders in people. Breed-specific disease associated genetic variants in only eight different genes are known to cause intrinsic platelet disorders in dogs. However, the causative genetic variant in many dog breeds has until now remained unknown. Four cases of a mild to severe bleeding disorder in Cocker Spaniel dogs are herein presented. The affected dogs showed a platelet adhesion defect characterized by macrothrombocytopenia with variable platelet counts resembling human Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS). Furthermore, the lack of functional GPIb-IX-V was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. Whole genome sequencing of one affected dog and visual inspection of the candidate genes identified a deletion in the glycoprotein IX platelet (GP9) gene. The GP9 gene encodes a subunit of a platelet surface membrane glycoprotein complex; this functions as a receptor for von Willebrand factor, which initiates the maintenance of hemostasis after injury. Variants in human GP9 are associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, type C. The deletion spanned 2460 bp, and included a significant part of the single coding exon of the canine GP9 gene on dog chromosome 20. The variant results in a frameshift and premature stop codon which is predicted to truncate almost two-thirds of the encoded protein. PCR-based genotyping confirmed recessive inheritance. The homozygous variant genotype seen in affected dogs did not occur in 98 control Cocker Spaniels. Thus, it was concluded that the structural variant identified in the GP9 gene was most likely causative for the BSS-phenotype in the dogs examined. These findings provide the first large animal GP9 model for this group of inherited platelet disorders and greatly facilitate the diagnosis and identification of affected and/or normal carriers in Cocker Spaniels."
