https://openalex.org/W2611652334,"The increasingly widespread use of mobile phone applications (apps) as research tools and cost-effective means of vast data collection raises new methodological challenges. In recent years, it has become a common practice for scientists to design apps that run only on a single operating system, thereby excluding large numbers of users who use a different operating system. However, empirical evidence investigating any selection biases that might result thereof is scarce. Henceforth, we conducted two studies drawing from a large multi-national (Study 1; N = 1,081) and a German-speaking sample (Study 2; N = 2,438). As such Study 1 compared iOS and Android users across an array of key personality traits (i.e., well-being, self-esteem, willingness to take risks, optimism, pessimism, Dark Triad, and the Big Five). Focusing on Big Five personality traits in a broader scope, in addition to smartphone users, Study 2 also examined users of the main computer operating systems (i.e., Mac OS, Windows). In both studies, very few significant differences were found, all of which were of small or even tiny effect size mostly disappearing after sociodemographics had been controlled for. Taken together, minor differences in personality seem to exist, but they are of small to negligible effect size (ranging from OR = 0.919 to 1.344 (Study 1), ηp2 = .005 to .036 (Study 2), respectively) and may reflect differences in sociodemographic composition, rather than operating system of smartphone users."
https://openalex.org/W2611439868,"Imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world. In this study, we used spraying methods to simulate field exposures of bees to formulated imidacloprid (Advise® 2FL) alone and binary mixtures with seven pesticides from different classes. Synergistic toxicity was detected from mixtures of Advise (58.6 mg a.i./L imidacloprid)+Domark (512.5 mg a.i. /L tetraconazole), Advise+Transform (58.5 mg a.i./L sulfoxaflor), and Advise+Vydate (68 mg a.i./L oxamyl), and mortality was significantly increased by 20%, 15%, and 26% respectively. The mixtures of Advise+Bracket (88.3 mg a.i./L acephate) and Advise+Karate (62.2 mg a.i./L L-cyhalothrin) showed additive interaction, while Advise+Belay (9.4 mg a.i./L clothianidin) and Advise+Roundup (1217.5 mg a.i./L glyphosate) had no additive/synergistic interaction. Spraying bees with the mixture of all eight pesticides increased mortality to 100%, significantly higher than all other treatments. Except Bracket which significantly suppressed esterase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, other treatments of Advise-only and mixtures with other pesticides did not suppress enzyme activities significantly, including invertase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and esterase and AChE. Immunity-related phenoloxidase (PO) activities in survivors tended to be more variable among treatments, but mostly still statistically similar to the control. By using specific enzyme inhibitors, we demonstrated that honey bees mainly rely on cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) for detoxifying Advise, while esterases and GSTs play substantially less roles in the detoxification. This study provided valuable information for guiding pesticide selection in premixing and tank mixing in order to alleviate toxicity risk to honey bees. Our findings indicated mixtures of Advise with detoxification-enzyme-inducing pesticides may help bees to detoxify Advise, while toxicity synergists may pose further risk to bees, such as the Bracket which not only suppressed esterase and AChE activities, but also increased toxicity to bees."
https://openalex.org/W2610364338,"Ultraviolet-B radiation (285-320 nm) elicits a number of cellular signaling elements. We investigated the preventive effect of linalool, a natural monoterpene, against UVB-induced oxidative imbalance, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) signaling in HDFa cells. We observed that linalool treatment (30 μM) prevented acute UVB-irradiation (20 mJ/cm2) mediated loss of activities of antioxidant enzymes in HDFa cells. The comet assay results illustrate that linalool significantly prevents UVB-mediated 8-deoxy guanosine formation (oxidative DNA damage) rather than UVB-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine (CPD) formation. This might be due to its ability to prevent UVB-induced ROS formation and to restore the oxidative imbalance of cells. This has been reflected in UVB-induced overexpression of MAPK and NF-κB signaling. We observed that linalool inhibited UVB-induced phosphorylation of ERK1, JNK and p38 proteins of MAPK family. Linalool inhibited UVB-induced activation of NF-κB/p65 by activating IκBa. We further observed that UVB-induced expression of TNF-α, IL6, IL-10, MMP-2 and MMP-9 was modulated by linalool treatment in HDFa cells. Thus, linalool protects the human skin cells from the oxidative damages of UVB radiation and modulates MAPK and NF-κB signaling in HDFa cells. The present findings substantiate that linalool may act as a photoprotective agent against UVB-induced skin damages."
https://openalex.org/W2610952444,"An increasing amount of species and gene identification studies rely on the use of next generation sequence analysis of either single isolate or metagenomics samples. Several methods are available to perform taxonomic annotations and a previous metagenomics benchmark study has shown that a vast number of false positive species annotations are a problem unless thresholds or post-processing are applied to differentiate between correct and false annotations. MGmapper is a package to process raw next generation sequence data and perform reference based sequence assignment, followed by a post-processing analysis to produce reliable taxonomy annotation at species and strain level resolution. An in-vitro bacterial mock community sample comprised of 8 genuses, 11 species and 12 strains was previously used to benchmark metagenomics classification methods. After applying a post-processing filter, we obtained 100% correct taxonomy assignments at species and genus level. A sensitivity and precision at 75% was obtained for strain level annotations. A comparison between MGmapper and Kraken at species level, shows MGmapper assigns taxonomy at species level using 84.8% of the sequence reads, compared to 70.5% for Kraken and both methods identified all species with no false positives. Extensive read count statistics are provided in plain text and excel sheets for both rejected and accepted taxonomy annotations. The use of custom databases is possible for the command-line version of MGmapper, and the complete pipeline is freely available as a bitbucked package (https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mgmapper). A web-version (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MGmapper) provides the basic functionality for analysis of small fastq datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2611786193,"Rat ultrasonic vocalizations have been suggested to be either a byproduct of physical movement or, in the case of 50-kHz calls, a means to communicate positive affect. Yet there are up to 14 distinct types of 50-kHz calls, raising issues for both explanations. To discriminate between these theories and address the purpose for the numerous 50-kHz call types, we studied single juvenile rats that were waiting to play with a partner, a situation associated with a high number of 50-kHz calls. We used a Monte-Carlo shuffling procedure to identify vocalization-behavior correlations that were statistically different from chance. We found that certain call types (“split”, “composite” and “multi-step”) were strongly associated with running and jumping while other call types (those involving “trills”) were more common during slower movements. Further, non-locomotor states such as resting and rearing were strongly predictive of a lack of vocalizations. We also found that the various sub-types of USVs can be clustered into 3–4 categories based on similarities in the way they are used. We did not find a one-to-one relationship between any movements and specific vocalizations, casting doubt on the motion byproduct theory. On the other hand, the use of specific calls during specific behaviors is problematic for the affect communication hypothesis. Based on our results, we suggest that ultrasonic calls may serve to coordinate moment-to-moment social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2611806947,"Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) is characterized by replacement of ligamentous tissue by ectopic new bone formation. OPLL causes narrowing of the spinal canal, resulting in neurological impairment. However, the pathogenesis of OPLL has not been fully elucidated. We investigated whether inflammation occurs in OPLL or not using high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) in a case-control study.This study included 103 patients with OPLL in the patient group and 95 age- and sex-matched volunteers with degenerative spinal disease in the control group. Of the 103 OPLL patients, 88 patients who were available for more than 2 years follow-up were checked for OPLL progression. A blood sample was obtained and Hs-CRP, and other routine data, including total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), glucose (Glu), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphate (Pi), white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet (PLT), were analyzed. The data were compared between the patients with OPLL and the controls. The severity of the ossified lesions in the whole spine were evaluated by the ossification index (OS index) in patients with OPLL. The data were also compared between the patients with OPLL progression (the progression group) and the patients without OPLL progression (the non-progression group). In the results, the mean hs-CRP in the OPLL group was higher than that in the controls. The Pi in the OPLL group was lower than that in the control group. A negative correlation was found between the Pi and the OS index. The mean hs-CRP in the progression group was higher than that in the non-progression group. There was a positive correlation between the average length of the OPLL progression per year and the hs-CRP.The results may suggest the occurrence of local inflammation in OPLL and the inflammation might cause OPLL progression. These facts are important for understanding the pathology of OPLL."
https://openalex.org/W2610198064,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men. A better understanding of the molecular basis of prostate cancer proliferation and metastasis should enable development of more effective treatments. In this study we focused on the lncRNA, prostate cancer associated transcript 29 (PCAT29), a putative tumor suppressive gene. Our data show that the expression of PCAT29 was reduced in prostate cancer tumors compared to paired perinormal prostate tissues. We also observed substantially lower levels of PCAT29 in DU145 and LNCaP cells compared to normal prostate (RWPE-1) cells. IL-6, a cytokine which is elevated in prostate tumors, reduced the expression of PCAT29 in both DU145 and LNCaP cells by activating signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). One downstream target of STAT3 is microRNA (miR)-21, inhibition of which enhanced basal PCAT29 expression. In addition, we show that resveratrol is a potent stimulator of PCAT29 expression under basal condition and reversed the down regulation of this lncRNA by IL-6. Furthermore, we show that knock down of PCAT29 expression by siRNA in DU145 and LNCaP cells increased cell viability while increasing PCAT29 expression with resveratrol decreased cell viability. Immunohistochemistry studies showed increased levels of STAT3 and IL-6, but low levels of programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), in prostate tumor epithelial cells compared to adjacent perinormal prostate epithelial cells. These data show that the IL-6/STAT3/miR-21 pathway mediates tonic suppression of PCAT29 expression and function. Inhibition of this signaling pathway by resveratrol induces PCAT29 expression and tumor suppressor function."
https://openalex.org/W2610390583,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) surveys are needed to evaluate regional and ethnic specificies. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the differences in HRQoL, frailty, and disability according to dialysis modality in the Korean population.We enrolled relatively stable maintenance dialysis patients. A total of 1,616 patients were recruited into our study. The demographic and laboratory data collected at enrollment included age, sex, comorbidities, frailty, disability, and HRQoL scales.A total of 1,250 and 366 participants underwent hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), respectively. The numbers of participants with pre-frailty and frailty were 578 (46.2%) and 422 (33.8%) in HD patients, and 165 (45.1%) and 137 (37.4%) in PD patients, respectively (P = 0.349). Participants with a disability included 195 (15.6%) HD patients and 109 (29.8%) PD patients (P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the mean physical component scale (PCS) and mental component scale (MCS), symptom/problems, and sleep scores were higher in HD patients than in PD patients. Cox regression analyses showed that an increased PCS in both HD and PD patients was positively associated with patient survival and first hospitalization-free survival. An increased MCS in both HD and PD patients was positively associated with first hospitalization-free survival only.There was no significant difference in frailty between patients treated with the two dialysis modalities; however, disability was more common in PD patients than in HD patients. The MCS and PCS were more favorable in HD patients than in PD patients. Symptom/problems, sleep, quality of social interaction, and social support were more favorable in HD patients than in PD patients; however, patient satisfaction and dialysis staff encouragement were more favorable in PD patients than in HD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2610939633,"The optimal distribution of the reinforcing fibers for stiffening hollow cylindrical composites is explored using the linear elasticity theory. The spatial distribution of the vascular bundles in wild bamboo, a nature-designed functionally graded material, is the basis for the design. Our results suggest that wild bamboos maximize their flexural rigidity by optimally regulating the radial gradation of their vascular bundle distribution. This fact provides us with a plant-mimetic design principle that enables the realization of high-stiffness and lightweight cylindrical composites."
https://openalex.org/W2611071250,"Insecticide usage in the United States is ubiquitous in urban, suburban, and rural environments. There is accumulating evidence that insecticides adversely affect non-target wildlife species, including birds, causing mortality, reproductive impairment, and indirect effects through loss of prey base, and the type and magnitude of such effects differs by chemical class, or mode of action. In evaluating data for an insecticide registration application and for registration review, scientists at the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) assess the fate of the insecticide and the risk the insecticide poses to the environment and non-target wildlife. Current USEPA risk assessments for pesticides generally rely on endpoints from laboratory based toxicity studies focused on groups of individuals and do not directly assess population-level endpoints. In this paper, we present a mechanistic model, which allows risk assessors to estimate the effects of insecticide exposure on the survival and seasonal productivity of birds known to forage in agricultural fields during their breeding season. This model relies on individual-based toxicity data and translates effects into endpoints meaningful at the population level (i.e., magnitude of mortality and reproductive impairment). The model was created from two existing USEPA avian risk assessment models, the Terrestrial Investigation Model (TIM v.3.0) and the Markov Chain Nest Productivity model (MCnest). The integrated TIM/MCnest model was used to assess the relative risk of 12 insecticides applied via aerial spray to control corn pests on a suite of 31 avian species known to forage in cornfields in agroecosystems of the Midwest, USA. We found extensive differences in risk to birds among insecticides, with chlorpyrifos and malathion (organophosphates) generally posing the greatest risk, and bifenthrin and λ-cyhalothrin (pyrethroids) posing the least risk. Comparative sensitivity analysis across the 31 species showed that ecological trait parameters related to the timing of breeding and reproductive output per nest attempt offered the greatest explanatory power for predicting the magnitude of risk. An important advantage of TIM/MCnest is that it allows risk assessors to rationally combine both acute (lethal) and chronic (reproductive) effects into a single unified measure of risk."
https://openalex.org/W2610976300,"Objective Several studies have suggested a possible relationship between recurrent benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and altered calcium homeostasis in the endolymph of the inner ear. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between Ca2+ and vitamin D status and BPPV occurrence as well as the status of bone biochemical markers in osteoporotic patients who were diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV. Methods The study included total 132 patients who were referred to our clinic between August 2008 and October 2013. Based on the bone mineral density (BMD) results, the subjects were divided into three groups: normal BMD (n = 34), osteopenia (n = 40) and osteoporosis (n = 58). The biochemical markers of bone turnover including serum Carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (s-CTX), osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and urinary free deoxypyridinoline (u-DPD), were analyzed, along with the serum Ca2+ and vitamin D levels. Results The mean serum calcium, phosphate and creatinine clearance levels were within the standard laboratory reference range. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was 11.8% (4/34) in the normal BMD group, 15% (6/40) in the osteopenia group and 43.1% (25/58) in the osteoporosis group. There was a positive correlation between the 25(OH)D and BMD results in the patients with BPPV. Among the bone turnover markers, the osteocalcin and u-DPD levels were significantly elevated in the osteoporotic patients with BPPV. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that osteoporosis and vitamin D deficiency were associated with BPPV. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the prevalence of BPPV in osteoporotic patients is associated with vitamin D deficiency and high bone turnover rates at systemic level, which could disturb local Ca2+ homeostasis in the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2610216144,"Polydatin (PD), a component isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, has a number of biological functions. However, the antitumor activity of PD has been poorly investigated. In this study, the effect of PD on cell proliferation was evaluated by thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation levels of panel of phosphor-kinases were detected by human phospho-kinase arrays. The expression of several proteins associated with cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Results showed that PD effectively inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that PD induced S-phase cell cycle arrest. Human phosphor-kinase arrays showed that the phosphorylation level of cAMP response element-bingding proteins(Creb) was down-regulated, and the results were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of protein of cyclin D1 decreased in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Results suggest that PD is a potential therapeutic natural compound."
https://openalex.org/W2611619142,"Anemia in children under 5 years of age is a global public health problem. According to the World Health Organization the current rate of anemia among preschool aged children in Equatorial Guinea is 66%. No information is available above this age. The cross-sectional Prevamal Survey was conducted in 2013 aimed at providing baseline data on malaria prevalence in children aged 2 months-15 years old. Sampling was carried out with the use of a multistage, stratified cluster strategy in the district of Bata, Equatorial Guinea. The χ2 test and adjusted Poisson regression models were applied to assess the association between social-demographic and economic factors, malaria and anemia. A total of 1436 children were tested, out of which 1,421 children (99%) were tested for anemia. Over 85% were anemic; out of them, 284 (24%), 815 (67%) and 111 (9%) children had mild, moderate and severe anemia, respectively. Severe anemia was more frequent among children aged 2–12 months old and those living in rural sites. About 47% tested positive for malaria via a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). This rate was significantly higher in rural villages (66%; p<0.001). The prevalence of anemia and malaria was higher in rural settings (p<0.001). On the other hand, anemia in urban areas displayed a heterogeneity and complexity that differed from the rural environment: in urban neighbourhoods, children with concomitant malaria infection were more likely to be anemic (adjusted prevalence rate (aPR):1.19; CI 95%: 1.12–1.28). Moreover, the prevalence of anemia was higher in children aged above 13 months compared to younger children (p<0.005). Belonging to the poorest wealth tertile were positively (aPR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.05–1.24) and children’ parents being employees (aPR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76–0.96) or self-employed (aPR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76–0.97) vs. working in agriculture and/or fishing negatively associated with anemia among urban children. This marked urban-rural variation indicates the importance of targeting specific areas or districts. Strategies aimed at reducing malaria are clearly paramount in this country. Prevention and treatment of other factors associated with the etiology of anemia (e.g., iron deficiency) are also likely necessary to combat the burden of anemia in Equatorial Guinea."
https://openalex.org/W2611784829,"Mosasauroids were a successful lineage of squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes) that radiated during the Late Cretaceous (95–66 million years ago). They can be considered one of the few lineages in the evolutionary history of tetrapods to have acquired a fully aquatic lifestyle, similarly to whales, ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. Despite a long history of research on this group, their phylogenetic relationships have only been tested so far using traditional (unweighted) maximum parsimony. However, hypotheses of mosasauroid relationships and the recently proposed multiple origins of aquatically adapted pelvic and pedal features in this group can be more thoroughly tested by methods that take into account variation in branch lengths and evolutionary rates. In this study, we present the first mosasauroid phylogenetic analysis performed under different analytical methods, including maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference, and implied weighting maximum parsimony. The results indicate a lack of congruence in the topological position of halisaurines and Dallasaurus. Additionally, the genus Prognathodon is paraphyletic under all hypotheses. Interestingly, a number of traditional mosasauroid clades become weakly supported, or unresolved, under Bayesian analyses. The reduced resolutions in some consensus trees create ambiguities concerning the evolution of fully aquatic pelvic/pedal conditions under many analyses. However, when enough resolution was obtained, reversals of the pelvic/pedal conditions were favoured by parsimony and likelihood ancestral state reconstructions instead of independent origins of aquatic features in mosasauroids. It is concluded that most of the observed discrepancies among the results can be associated with different analytical procedures, but also due to limited postcranial data on halisaurines, yaguarasaurines and Dallasaurus."
https://openalex.org/W2610381774,"Paenibacillus larvae is a Gram positive bacterium and the causative agent of the most widespread fatal brood disease of honey bees, American foulbrood (AFB). A total of thirty-three independent Paenibacillus larvae isolates from various geographical origins in North America and five reference strains were investigated for genetic diversity using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). This technique is regarded to be a powerful tool for epidemiological studies of pathogenic bacteria and is widely used in genotyping assays. For MLST, seven housekeeping gene loci, ilvD (dihydroxy-acid dyhydrogenase), tri (triosephosphate isomerase), purH (phospharibosyl-aminoimidazolecarboxamide), recF (DNA replication and repair protein), pyrE (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase), sucC (succinyl coenzyme A synthetase β subunit) and glpF (glycerol uptake facilitator protein) were studied and applied for primer designs. Previously, ERIC type DNA fingerprinting was applied to these same isolates and the data showed that almost all represented the ERIC I type, whereas using BOX-PCR gave an indication of more diversity. All isolates were screened for resistance to four antibiotics used by U.S. beekeepers, showing extensive resistance to tetracycline and the first records of resistance to tylosin and lincomycin. Our data highlight the intraspecies relationships of P. larvae and the potential application of MLST methods in enhancing our understanding of epidemiological relationships among bacterial isolates of different origins."
https://openalex.org/W2610594105,"Bisphenol S (BPS) is widely used as a raw material in industry, resulting in its ubiquitous distribution in natural environment, including the aqueous environment. However, the effect of BPS on the thyroid endocrine system is largely unknown. In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos were exposed to BPS at 1, 3, 10, and 30 μg/L, from 2 h post-fertilization (hpf) to 168hpf. Bioconcentration of BPS and whole-body thyroid hormones (THs), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations as well as transcriptional profiling of key genes related to the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis were examined. Chemical analysis indicated that BPS was accumulated in zebrafish larvae. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) levels were significantly decreased at ≥ 10 and 30 μg/L of BPS, respectively. However, TSH concentration was significantly induced in the 10 and 30 μg/L BPS-treated groups. After exposure to BPS, the mRNA expression of corticotrophin releasing hormone (crh) and thyroglobulin (tg) genes were up-regulated at ≥10 μg/L of BPS, in a dose-response manner. The transcription of genes involved in thyroid development (pax8) and synthesis (sodium/iodide symporter, slc5a5) were also significantly increased in the 30 μg/L of BPS treatment group. Moreover, exposure to 10 μg/L or higher concentration of BPS significantly up-regulated genes related to thyroid hormone metabolism (deiodinases, dio1, dio2 and uridinediphosphate glucoronosyltransferases, ugt1ab), which might be responsible for the altered THs levels. However, the transcript of transthyretin (ttr) was significantly down-regulated at ≥ 3 μg/L of BPS, while the mRNA levels of thyroid hormone receptors (trα and trβ) and dio3 remained unchanged. All the results indicated that exposure to BPS altered the whole-body THs and TSH concentrations and changed the expression profiling of key genes related to HPT axis, thus triggering thyroid endocrine disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2611942222,"Mucosal immunity is important for the protection against a wide variety of pathogens. Traditional vaccines administered via parenteral routes induce strong systemic immunity, but they often fail to generate mucosal IgA. In contrast, bacteria-based vaccines comprise an appealing strategy for antigen delivery to mucosal sites. Vaginal infection with Chlamydia trachomatis can develop into upper genital tract infections that can lead to infertility. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine against Chlamydia is a high priority. In the present study, we have explored the use of a common lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum, as a vector for delivery of a C. trachomatis antigen to mucosal sites. The antigen, referred as Hirep2 (H2), was anchored to the surface of L. plantarum cells using an N-terminal lipoprotein anchor. After characterization, the constructed strain was used as an immunogenic agent in mice. We explored a heterologous prime-boost strategy, consisting of subcutaneous priming with soluble H2 antigen co-administered with CAF01 adjuvant, followed by an intranasal boost with H2-displaying L. plantarum. The results show that, when used as a booster, the recombinant L. plantarum strain was able to evoke cellular responses. Most importantly, booster immunization with the Lactobacillus-based vaccine induced generation of antigen-specific IgA in the vaginal cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2610498192,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection induces vigorous inflammatory mediators secreted by epithelial cells, which do not necessarily eradicate the pathogen. Nonetheless, it reduces lung function due to significant airway damage, most importantly in cystic fibrosis patients. Recently, we published that TP359, a proprietary cationic peptide had potent bactericidal effects against P. aeruginosa, which were mediated by down-regulating its outer membrane biogenesis genes. Herein, we hypothesized that TP359 bactericidal effects could also serve to regulate P. aeruginosa-induced lung inflammation. We explored this hypothesis by infecting human A549 lung cells with live P. aeruginosa non-isogenic, mucoid and non-mucoid strains and assessed the capacity of TP359 to regulate the levels of elicited TNFα, IL-6 and IL-8 inflammatory cytokines. In all instances, the mucoid strain elicited higher concentrations of cytokines in comparison to the non-mucoid strain, and TP359 dose-dependently down-regulated their respective levels, suggesting its regulation of lung inflammation. Surprisingly, P. aeruginosa flagellin, and not its lipopolysaccharide moiety, was the primary inducer of inflammatory cytokines in lung cells, which were similarly down-regulated by TP359. Blocking of TLR5, the putative flagellin receptor, completely abrogated the capacity of infected lung cells to secrete cytokines, underscoring that TP359 regulates inflammation via the TLR5-dependent signaling pathway. Downstream pathway-specific inhibition studies further revealed that the MAPK pathway, essentially p38 and JNK are necessary for induction of P. aeruginosa elicited inflammatory cytokines and their down-regulation by TP359. Collectively, our data provides evidence to support exploring the relevancy of TP359 as an anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory agent against P. aeruginosa for clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2610472892,"The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are key regulators for sterol homeostasis in most fungi. In the citrus postharvest pathogen Penicillium digitatum, the SREBP homolog is required for fungicide resistance and regulation of CYP51 expression. In this study, we identified another SREBP transcription factor PdSreB in P. digitatum, and the biological functions of both SREBPs were characterized and compared. Inactivation of PdsreA, PdsreB or both genes in P. digitatum reduced ergosterol contents and increased sensitivities to sterol 14-α-demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and cobalt chloride. Fungal strains impaired at PdsreA but not PdsreB increased sensitivity to tridemorph and an iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl. Virulence assays on citrus fruit revealed that fungal strains impaired at PdsreA, PdsreB or both induce maceration lesions similar to those induced by wild-type. However, ΔPdsreA, ΔPdsreB or the double mutant strain rarely produce aerial mycelia on infected citrus fruit peels. RNA-Seq analysis showed the broad regulatory functions of both SREBPs in biosynthesis, transmembrane transportation and stress responses. Our results provide new insights into the conserved and differentiated regulatory functions of SREBP homologs in plant pathogenic fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2611313058,"Offshore windfarms provide renewable energy, but activities during the construction phase can affect marine mammals. To understand how the construction of an offshore windfarm in the Maryland Wind Energy Area (WEA) off Maryland, USA, might impact harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), it is essential to determine their poorly understood year-round distribution. Although habitat-based models can help predict the occurrence of species in areas with limited or no sampling, they require validation to determine the accuracy of the predictions. Incorporating more than 18 months of harbour porpoise detection data from passive acoustic monitoring, generalized auto-regressive moving average and generalized additive models were used to investigate harbour porpoise occurrence within and around the Maryland WEA in relation to temporal and environmental variables. Acoustic detection metrics were compared to habitat-based density estimates derived from aerial and boat-based sightings to validate the model predictions. Harbour porpoises occurred significantly more frequently during January to May, and foraged significantly more often in the evenings to early mornings at sites within and outside the Maryland WEA. Harbour porpoise occurrence peaked at sea surface temperatures of 5°C and chlorophyll a concentrations of 4.5 to 7.4 mg m-3. The acoustic detections were significantly correlated with the predicted densities, except at the most inshore site. This study provides insight into previously unknown fine-scale spatial and temporal patterns in distribution of harbour porpoises offshore of Maryland. The results can be used to help inform future monitoring and mitigate the impacts of windfarm construction and other human activities."
https://openalex.org/W2610327424,"Background Multiple strains infection of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) was found to be correlated with increased viral load in immunodeficient patients. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying this correlation remains unclear. To evaluate genetic polymorphisms of HCMV glycoprotein and their potential role in its viral load, HCMV glycoprotein B, N, and O (gB, gN and gO) genotypes was studied in the population of HCMV infected acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The association between glycoprotein polymorphisms and HCMV viral load was analyzed. Methods The genetic polymorphisms of glycoprotein from sera of 60 HCMV infected AIDS patients was investigated by multiplex nested PCR and sequencing. HCMV viral load was evaluated by quantitative PCR. Results gB1, gO1a, and gN4a were the predominant glycoprotein genotypes in HCMV infected AIDS patients and composed 86.96%, 78.8%, and 49.2%, respectively. Only gN4a genotype infection significantly increased viral load (P = 0.048). 71% (43/60) of HCMV infected AIDS patients were found to carry multiple HCMV strains infection. A novel potential linkage of gO1a/gN4a was identified from multiple HCMV infected patients. It was the most frequent occurrence, accounted for 51.5% in 33 patients with gO and gN genotypes infection. Furthermore, the gO1a/gN4a linkage was correlated to an increased viral load (P = 0.020). Conclusion The gN4a correlates to higher level HCMV load in AIDS patients. Interestingly, a novel gO1a/gN4a linkage is identified from the patients with multiple HCMV strains infection and is also associated with an increased viral load. Therefore, the pathogenic mechanism underlying glycoprotein polymorphisms and interaction of variants should be analyzed further."
https://openalex.org/W2611312466,"Invasive plant species often dominate native species in competition, augmenting other potential advantages such as release from natural enemies. Resource pre-emption may be a particularly important mechanism for establishing dominance over competitors of the same functional type. We hypothesized that competitive success of an exotic grass against native grasses is mediated by establishing an early size advantage. We tested this prediction among four perennial C4 warm-season grasses: the exotic weed Johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparius) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). We predicted that a) the competitive effect of Johnsongrass on target species would be proportional to their initial biomass difference, b) competitive effect and response would be negatively correlated and c) soil fertility would have little effect on competitive relationships. In a greenhouse, plants of the four species were grown from seed either alone or with one Johnsongrass neighbor at two fertilizer levels and periodically harvested. The first two hypotheses were supported: The seedling biomass of single plants at first harvest (50 days after seeding) ranked the same way as the competitive effect of Johnsongrass on target species: Johnsongrass < big bluestem < little bluestem/switchgrass, while Johnsongrass responded more strongly to competition from Johnsongrass than from native species. At final harvest, native plants growing with Johnsongrass attained between 2-5% of their single-plant non-root biomass, while Johnsongrass growing with native species attained 89% of single-plant non-root biomass. Fertilization enhanced Johnsongrass' competitive effects on native species, but added little to the already severe competitive suppression. Accelerated early growth of Johnsongrass seedlings relative to native seedlings appeared to enable subsequent resource pre-emption. Size-asymmetric competition and resource-pre-emption may be a critical mechanism by which exotic invasive species displace functionally similar native species and alter the functional dynamics of native communities."
https://openalex.org/W2610500024,"Courtship songs have undergone a spectacular diversification in the Drosophila buzzatii cluster. Accordingly, it has been suggested that sexual selection has played a significant role in promoting rapid diversification, reproductive isolation and speciation. However, there is no direct evidence (i.e., song playback experiments with wingless males) supporting this tenet. Moreover, several studies have showed that the courtship song in the genus Drosophila is not always used in female mate choice decisions, nor plays the same role when it is taken into account. In this vein, we use an approach that combines manipulative and playback experiments to explore the importance and the role of courtship song in female mate choice in four species of the D. buzzatii cluster and one species of the closely related D. martensis cluster for outgroup comparison. We also investigate the importance of courtship song in sexual isolation in sympatry between the only semi-cosmopolitan species, D. buzzatii, and the other species of the D. buzzatii cluster. Our study revealed that the courtship song is used by females of the D. buzzatii cluster as a criterion for male acceptance or influences the speed with which males are chosen. In contrast, we showed that this characteristic is not shared by D. venezolana, the representative species of the D. martensis cluster. We also found that the studied species of the D. buzzatii cluster differ in the role that conspecific and heterospecific songs have in female mate choice and in sexual isolation. Our findings support the hypothesis that divergence in female preferences for courtship songs has played a significant role in promoting rapid diversification and reproductive isolation in the D. buzzatii cluster. However, evidence from D. venezolana suggests that the use of the courtship song in female mate choice is not a conserved feature in the D. buzzatii complex."
https://openalex.org/W2611503052,"Objective The objective of this analysis is to compare people with prevalent type 2 diabetes, incident type 2 diabetes and without diabetes with respect to longitudinal change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) when adjusting for baseline determinants of HRQOL. Research design and methods Primary baseline and follow-up data from three regional and one national population-based cohort studies in Germany were pooled for analysis. HRQOL was measured using physical and mental health summary scores (PCS and MCS) from the German version of the Short Form Health Survey with 36 or 12 items. Mean score change per observation year was compared between the three groups (prevalent diabetes, incident diabetes, no diabetes) based on linear regression models. Results The analysis included pooled data from 5367 people aged 45–74 years at baseline. Of these, 85.5% reported no diabetes at baseline and follow-up, 6.3% reported diabetes at both baseline and follow-up (prevalent diabetes), and 8.2% reported diabetes only at follow-up (incident diabetes). Over a mean observation period of 8.7 years, annual decline in HRQOL scores is pronounced at 0.27–0.32 (PCS) and 0.34–0.38 (MCS) in the group with prevalent diabetes compared with people without diabetes. Those with incident diabetes showed intermediate values but did not differ significantly from people without diabetes after adjustment for covariates in the full model. Conclusion Compared with data from cross-sectional analysis, the HRQOL loss associated with prevalent diabetes appears to be much larger than previously assumed."
https://openalex.org/W2610309742,"Some latency-reversing agents (LRAs) inhibit HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. In a prior study of protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, we found that bryostatin-1 inhibited elite controller/suppressor (ES) CD8+ T cell suppressive activity whereas prostratin had no effect. Ingenol-B is another PKC agonist with potent LRA activity both by itself and in combination with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1; however its effect on CD8+ T cell mediated control of HIV-1 replication is unknown.CD8+ T cells were isolated from ES and treated with bryostatin-1, prostratin, ingenol-B, and JQ1 as well as a combination of each PKC-agonist with JQ1. The cells were then tested in the viral suppression assay. To assess possible mechanisms of inhibition, CD8+ T cells were treated with the LRAs and analyzed for the expression of various immune cell markers.Ingenol-B had no effect on the ability of ES CD8+ T cells to suppress viral replication, however, the combination of ingenol-B and JQ1 caused a modest, but significant decrease in this suppressive capacity. The mechanism of the inhibitory effect of the JQ1 and ingenol-B combination relative to ingenol-B alone was unclear but the effect appeared to be dose dependent.Ingenol-B does not inhibit HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vitro. These responses are however modestly inhibited when 100 nMingenol-B is combined with JQ1. Since HIV-specific CD8+ T cell activity may be essential for the eradication of reactivated latently infected cells, the potency of latency-reversal activity of drug combinations must be balanced against the effects of the combinations on HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses."
https://openalex.org/W2611113738,"Numerous restoration campaigns focused on re-establishing species-rich floodplain meadows of Central Europe, whose species composition is essentially controlled by regular flooding. Climate change predictions expect strong alterations on the discharge regime of Europe's large rivers with little-known consequences on floodplain meadow plants. In this study, we aim to determine the effects of flooding on seedlings of different ages of four typical flood meadow species. To this end, we flooded seedlings of two familial pairs of flood meadow species of wetter and dryer microhabitats for 2 weeks each, starting 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after seedling germination, respectively. We show that a 2-week-flooding treatment had a negative effect on performance of seedlings younger than 6 weeks. Summer floods with high floodwater temperatures may have especially detrimental effects on seedlings, which is corroborated by previous findings. As expected, the plants from wet floodplain meadow microhabitats coped better with the flooding treatment than those from dryer microhabitats. In conclusion, our results suggest that restoration measures may perform more successfully if seedlings of restored species are older than the critical age of about 6 weeks before a spring flooding begins. Seasonal flow patterns may influence vegetation dynamics of floodplain meadows and should, therefore, be taken into account when timing future restoration campaigns."

We created a live theatrical stimulus and three audio-visual stimuli (each one with a different video editing style) having the same narrative, and displayed them randomly to participants (20 media professionals and 20 non-media professionals). For media professionals, watching movies on screens evoked a significantly lower spontaneous blink rate (SBR) than looking at theatrical performances. Media professionals presented a substantially lower SBR than non-media professionals when watching screens, and more surprisingly, also when seeing reality. According to our results, media professionals pay higher attention to both screens and the real world than do non-media professionals."
https://openalex.org/W2611535218,"Exercise induces adaptation of skeletal muscle by acutely modulating intracellular signaling, gene expression, protein turnover and myogenic activation of skeletal muscle stem cells (Satellite cells, SCs). Lactate (La)-induced metabolic stimulation alone has been shown to modify SC proliferation and differentiation. Although the mechanistic basis remains elusive, it was demonstrated that La affects signaling via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) which might contribute to trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) known to regulate satellite cell proliferation and differentiation. We investigated the effects of La on p38 MAPK and H3K4me3 in a model of activated SCs. Differentiating C2C12 myoblasts were treated with La (20 mM) and samples analysed using qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. We determined a reduction of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, decreased H3K4me3 and reduced expression of Myf5, myogenin, and myosin heavy chain (MHC) leading to decreased differentiation of La-treated C2C12 cells after 5 days of repeated La treatment. We further investigated whether this regulatory pathway would be affected in human skeletal muscle by the application of two different resistance exercise regimes (RE) associated with distinct metabolic demands and blood La accumulation. Muscle biopsies were obtained 15, 30 min, 1, 4, and 24 h post exercise after moderate intensity RE (STD) vs. high intensity RE (HIT). Consistent with in vitro results, reduced p38 phosphorylation and blunted H3K4me3 were also observed upon metabolically demanding HIT RE in human skeletal muscle. Our data provide evidence that La-accumulation acutely affects p38 MAPK signaling, gene expression and thereby cell differentiation and adaptation in vitro, and likely in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2610993437,"The origin and natural history of molecular functions hold the key to the emergence of cellular organization and modern biochemistry. Here we use a genomic census of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to reconstruct phylogenies at the three highest (1, 2 and 3) and the lowest (terminal) levels of the hierarchy of molecular functions, which reflect the broadest and the most specific GO definitions, respectively. These phylogenies define evolutionary timelines of functional innovation. We analyzed 249 free-living organisms comprising the three superkingdoms of life, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Phylogenies indicate catalytic, binding and transport functions were the oldest, suggesting a 'metabolism-first' origin scenario for biochemistry. Metabolism made use of increasingly complicated organic chemistry. Primordial features of ancient molecular functions and functional recruitments were further distilled by studying the oldest child terms of the oldest level 1 GO definitions. Network analyses showed the existence of an hourglass pattern of enzyme recruitment in the molecular functions of the directed acyclic graph of molecular functions. Older high-level molecular functions were thoroughly recruited at younger lower levels, while very young high-level functions were used throughout the timeline. This pattern repeated in every one of the three mappings, which gave a criss-cross pattern. The timelines and their mappings were remarkable. They revealed the progressive evolutionary development of functional toolkits, starting with the early rise of metabolic activities, followed chronologically by the rise of macromolecular biosynthesis, the establishment of controlled interactions with the environment and self, adaptation to oxygen, and enzyme coordinated regulation, and ending with the rise of structural and cellular complexity. This historical account holds important clues for dissection of the emergence of biomcomplexity and life."
https://openalex.org/W2611230796,"Over the last years, the omnipresent standardization of playgrounds—the distances between, for example, jumping stones tend to be equal—has been criticized by both scientists and architects. First, it has been argued that standardization fails to do justice to the variability in the children’s action capabilities. Second, it might simplify play in that children repetitively cross over the same distance and, thus, do not have to worry about their movements anymore. In the present study we examined the gap-crossing behavior of children in both a standardized and a nonstandardized jumping stone configuration. Children, between 5 and 10 years of age, were to play in each configuration for two minutes. No significant differences between the configurations were found in the number of gaps the children crossed and the percentage of jumps (ps>0.05). However, more children crossed a gap that they perceived as challenging (i.e. gap width close to their estimated maximum jumping distance) in the nonstandardized configuration than in the standardized one. Interestingly, significant differences were found in variables reflecting the children’s action preparation—the variation in both the time on a jumping stone and the numbers of steps on it was bigger in the nonstandardized playground than in the standardized one (ps<0.05). The implications of these findings are discussed for both the design of playgrounds and the academic discussions about them."
https://openalex.org/W2611625612,"Limb bud patterning, outgrowth, and differentiation are precisely regulated in a spatio-temporal manner through integrated networks of transcription factors, signaling molecules, and downstream genes. However, the exact mechanisms that orchestrate morphogenesis of the limb remain to be elucidated. Previously, we have established EMBRYS, a whole-mount in situ hybridization database of transcription factors. Based on the findings from EMBRYS, we focused our expression pattern analysis on a selection of transcription factor genes that exhibit spatially localized and temporally dynamic expression patterns with respect to the anterior-posterior axis in the E9.5–E11.5 limb bud. Among these genes, Irx3 showed a posteriorly expanded expression domain in Shh-/- limb buds and an anteriorly reduced expression domain in Gli3-/- limb buds, suggesting their importance in anterior-posterior patterning. To assess the stepwise EMBRYS-based screening system for anterior regulators, we generated Irx3 transgenic mice in which Irx3 was expressed in the entire limb mesenchyme under the Prrx1 regulatory element. The Irx3 gain-of-function model displayed complex phenotypes in the autopods, including digit loss, radial flexion, and fusion of the metacarpal bones, suggesting that Irx3 may contribute to the regulation of limb patterning, especially in the autopods. Our results demonstrate that gene expression analysis based on EMBRYS could contribute to the identification of genes that play a role in patterning of the limb mesenchyme."
https://openalex.org/W2611932235,"Aggregation of proteins is an undesired phenomena that affects both human health and bioengineered products such as therapeutic proteins. Finding preventative measures could be facilitated by a molecular-level understanding of dimer formation, which is the first step in aggregation. Here we present a molecular dynamics (MD) study of dimer formation propensity in human lysozyme and its D67H variant. Because the latter protein aggregates while the former does not, they offer an ideal system for testing the feasibility of the proposed MD approach which comprises three stages: i) partially unfolded conformers involved in dimer formation are generated via high-temperature MD simulations, ii) potential dimer structures are searched using docking and refined with MD, iii) free energy calculations are performed to find the most stable dimer structure. Our results provide a detailed explanation for how a single mutation (D67H) turns human lysozyme from non-aggregating to an aggregating protein. Conversely, the proposed method can be used to identify the residues causing aggregation in a protein, which can be mutated to prevent it."
https://openalex.org/W2611326524,"A fast and robust interpolation filter based on finite difference TPS has been proposed in this paper. The proposed method employs discrete cosine transform to efficiently solve the linear system of TPS equations in case of gridded data, and by a pre-defined weight function with respect to simulation residuals to reduce the effect of outliers and misclassified non-ground points on the accuracy of reference ground surface construction. Fifteen groups of benchmark datasets, provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) commission, were employed to compare the performance of the proposed method with that of the multi-resolution hierarchical classification method (MHC). Results indicate that with respect to kappa coefficient and total error, the proposed method is averagely more accurate than MHC. Specifically, the proposed method is 1.03 and 1.32 times as accurate as MHC in terms of kappa coefficient and total errors. More importantly, the proposed method is averagely more than 8 times faster than MHC. In comparison with some recently developed methods, the proposed algorithm also achieves a good performance."
https://openalex.org/W2611602179,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene may modulate its transcription and affect the regulation of blood pressure via activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). In this regard, we have identified polymorphisms in the 2.5 Kb promoter of the hAGT gene that form two haplotype (Hap) blocks: -6A/G (-1670A/G, -1562C/T, -1561T/C) and -217A/G (-532T/C, -793A/G, -1074T/C & -1178G/A). hAGT gene with Hap -6A/-217A (Hap I) is associated with increased blood pressure whereas, Hap -6G/-217G (Hap II) is associated with normal blood pressure in human subjects. Since RAAS over activity contributes to hypertension in obesity, we have made transgenic mice (TG) containing either Hap I or Hap II of the hAGT gene to understand the role of obesity on its transcriptional regulation. Although, a high-fat diet (60% Kcal from fat, 12 weeks) elevates hAGT and mAGT regardless of haplotype, this effect is significantly (p<0.05) accentuated in Hap I mice, in both adipose and liver tissues. Chromatin Immuno- precipitation (ChIP) assay shows an increased binding of transcription factors including, GR, CEBPβ and STAT3 to the chromatin of the Hap I TG mice after high-fat diet as compared to Hap II TG mice (p<0.05). Differential plasma levels of hAGT in Hap II and I mice, after high-fat diet, further corroborate the variable transcriptional regulation of the hAGT, governed by gene-haplotypes. Taken together, our results show that SNPs in the Hap-I of the hAGT gene promote high-fat diet-induced binding of transcription factors GR, CEBP-β and STAT3, which lead to elevated expression of the hAGT gene in hepatic and adipose tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2610805158,"Recent technical and strategical developments have increased the survival chances for avalanche victims. Still hundreds of people, primarily recreationists, get caught and buried by snow avalanches every year. About 100 die each year in the European Alps–and many more worldwide. Refining concepts for avalanche rescue means to optimize the procedures such that the survival chances are maximized in order to save the greatest possible number of lives. Avalanche rescue includes several parameters related to terrain, natural hazards, the people affected by the event, the rescuers, and the applied search and rescue equipment. The numerous parameters and their complex interaction make it unrealistic for a rescuer to take, in the urgency of the situation, the best possible decisions without clearly structured, easily applicable decision support systems. In order to analyse which measures lead to the best possible survival outcome in the complex environment of an avalanche accident, we present a numerical approach, namely a Monte Carlo simulation. We demonstrate the application of Monte Carlo simulations for two typical, yet tricky questions in avalanche rescue: (1) calculating how deep one should probe in the first passage of a probe line depending on search area, and (2) determining for how long resuscitation should be performed on a specific patient while others are still buried. In both cases, we demonstrate that optimized strategies can be calculated with the Monte Carlo method, provided that the necessary input data are available. Our Monte Carlo simulations also suggest that with a strict focus on the ""greatest good for the greatest number"", today's rescue strategies can be further optimized in the best interest of patients involved in an avalanche accident."
https://openalex.org/W2611545743,"Cone penetration testing (CPT) is one of the most efficient and versatile methods currently available for geotechnical, lithostratigraphic and hydrogeological site characterization. Currently available methods for soil behaviour type classification (SBT) of CPT data however have severe limitations, often restricting their application to a local scale. For parameterization of regional groundwater flow or geotechnical models, and delineation of regional hydro- or lithostratigraphy, regional SBT classification would be very useful. This paper investigates the use of model-based clustering for SBT classification, and the influence of different clustering approaches on the properties and spatial distribution of the obtained soil classes. We additionally propose a methodology for automated lithostratigraphic mapping of regionally occurring sedimentary units using SBT classification. The methodology is applied to a large CPT dataset, covering a groundwater basin of ~60 km2 with predominantly unconsolidated sandy sediments in northern Belgium. Results show that the model-based approach is superior in detecting the true lithological classes when compared to more frequently applied unsupervised classification approaches or literature classification diagrams. We demonstrate that automated mapping of lithostratigraphic units using advanced SBT classification techniques can provide a large gain in efficiency, compared to more time-consuming manual approaches and yields at least equally accurate results."
https://openalex.org/W2610739283,"Artificial, anisotropic fibre phantoms are nowadays increasingly used in the field of diffusion-weighted MRI. Such phantoms represent useful tools for, among others, the calibration of pulse sequences and validation of diffusion models since they can mimic well-known structural features of brain tissue on the one hand, but exhibit a reduced complexity, on the other. Among all materials, polyethylene fibres have been widely used due to their excellent properties regarding the restriction of water diffusion and surface relaxation properties. Yet the magnetic susceptibility of polyethylene can be distinctly lower than that of distilled water. This difference produces strong microscopic, background field gradients in the vicinity of fibre bundles which are not parallel to the static magnetic field. This, in turn, modulates the MRI signal behaviour. In the present work we investigate an approach to reduce the susceptibility-induced background gradients via reducing the heterogeneity in the internal magnetic susceptibility. An aqueous solution of magnesium chloride hexahydrate (MgCl2·6H2O) is used for this purpose. Its performance is demonstrated in dedicated anisotropic fibre phantoms with different geometrical configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2610850445,"Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is a highly effective phenolic antioxidant used in edible oils and fats in foods as well as in medicines and cosmetics. TBHQ has been shown to have both chemoprotective and carcinogenic effects. Furthermore, it has potential anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenic, and neuroprotective activities. TBHQ induces phase II detoxification enzymes via the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE mechanism, which contributes to its chemopreventive functions. Nonetheless, there is growing evidence that biological effects of tBHQ may be mediated by Nrf2-independent mechanisms related to various signaling cascades. Here, we studied changes in gene expression of phase I, II, and III drug metabolizing enzymes/transporters as well as protein levels and activities of cytochromes P450 (CYPs) elicited by tBHQ and its structural homolog TS-13 in the mouse liver. Next, we carried out gene expression analysis to identify signal transduction pathways modulated by the antioxidants. Mice received 100 mg/kg tBHQ or TS-13 per day or only vehicle. The liver was collected at 12 hours and after 7 days of the treatment. Protein and total RNA were extracted. Gene expression was analyzed using Mouse Drug Metabolism and Signal Transduction PathwayFinder RT2Profiler™PCR Arrays. A western blot analysis was used to measure protein levels and a fluorometric assay was employed to study activities of CYPs. Genes that were affected more than 1.5-fold by tBHQ or TS-13 treatment compared with vehicle were identified. Analysis of the gene expression data revealed changes in various genes that are important for drug metabolism, cellular defense mechanisms, inflammation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. Novel target genes were identified, including xenobiotic metabolism genes encoding CYPs, phase II/III drug metabolizing enzymes/transporters. For Cyp1a2 and Cyp2b, we observed an increase in protein levels and activities during tBHQ or TS-13 treatment. Changes were found in the gene expression regulated by NFκB, androgen, retinoic acid, PI3K/AKT, Wnt, Hedgehog and other pathways."

Appropriateness of antimicrobial use was evaluated using the Global-Prevalence Survey method designed by the University of Antwerp. The percentages of MDR pathogens relative to the total number of isolates of K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were higher on the S (86.2% and 49.1%) than on the M (63.2% and 36.9%) wards. The percentage of MDR A. baumannii was not different between S (93.7%) and M (79.5%) wards. An overall antibiotics consumption (defined daily doses/100 bed-days) during study was 369.7 and 261.5 on the S and M wards, respectively. A total of 225 prescriptions of antimicrobials were evaluated in138 adults admitted to wards on the day of the survey. The percentage of antimicrobials prescribed for prophylaxis on the M and S wards were 0% and 25%, respectively. Therapies were more frequently empiric (S, 86.8% and M, 80%). The percentages of medical errors on the S and M wards were 74.6% and 27.3%, respectively. The quality indicators for antibiotic prescribing on the S and M wards were as follows: the incorrect choice of antimicrobials (35.6% vs. 20.0%), inappropriate dose interval (70.6% vs. 16.9%) or duration of therapy (72.5% vs. 23.1%), a non-documented stop/review data (73.6% vs. 16.9%) and divergence from guidelines (71.9% vs. 23.1%). Treatment based on biomarkers was more common on the M wards as compared to the S wards. The increasing prevalence of MDR pathogens, a very high consumption and incorrect prescribing of antimicrobials need special attention, particularly on the S wards."

This retrospective study reviewed patients with OC treated with BEV and analyzed their results.All patients with OC treated with BEV from 2009 to 2015 in the Linkou branch of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Northern Taiwan were included. According to the means of administration, the patients were classified into 6 groups as follows: A-BEV plus chemotherapy (C/T) for initial platinum-resistant (PR) recurrent OC, B-BEV plus C/T for initial platinum-sensitive (PS) recurrent OC, C-BEV alone for recurrent OC, D-BEV plus 1st adjuvant C/T, E-BEV plus neoadjuvant C/T, and F-intraperitoneal (IP) BEV. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), hazard ratios (HRs), overall response rate (ORR), and mean number of BEV cycles were analyzed for groups A to E. Clinical improvement of ascites was assessed for group F.A comparison of early use (only one round of prior C/T) versus late use (multiple rounds of prior C/T) in patients of groups A and B showed a superior PFS (8.27 vs. 3.67, p = 0.037) in the early use group. No significant differences were found between groups A and B (PFS: 4.24 vs. 4.17 months, p = 0.690; OS: 10.06 vs. 9.93 months, p = 0.819; mean BEV cycles: 4.63 vs. 5.0 p = 0.992; ORR: 48.1% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.425). Comparing the response and non-response subgroups of patients in groups A and B, a better outcome was associated with endometrioid type cell (HR = 0.28, p = 0.008), good ECOG performance status (HR = 0.51, p = 0.005), and lack of ascites (HR = 0.67, p = 0.004). Comparing group C with groups A plus B, the BEV alone group had a poorer PFS (1.02 VS. 4.19, p = 0.04) and OS (1.42 VS. 9.99 p = 0.001) than the BEV plus C/T group. In group F, a good clinical benefit rate (85.6%) of ascites improvement was noted. Two patients had grade 5 gastrointestinal bleeding and venous/arterial thromboembolic events after administration of BEV. Grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred more frequently in our study.Early use of BEV combined with chemotherapy had a significant benefit in PFS for patients with recurrent OC. BEV plus chemotherapy was better than BEV alone for recurrent OC. In addition, IP BEV was helpful for improving clinical ascites."

Methods We identified 10,304 women with primary pure unilateral LCIS between 1998 and 2007 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) 18 Registries. Kaplan–Meier estimates of 5 or 10-year probabilities of second ipsilateral breast cancers (IBCs) and contralateral breast cancers (CBCs) were calculated. Multivariable Cox proportional model was performed to identify impact of HR status of primary LCIS, and other demographic, clinicopathologic or treatment characteristics on risk of second IBCs or CBCs. Results Of the 10,304 women with primary LCIS included in this study, 9949 (96.5%) patients had HR+ tumors, and 355 (3.5%) had HR- tumors. Multivariable-adjusted analyses showed that although there was no difference in risk of total second IBCs between women with HR+ and HR- LCIS (P = 0.152), patients with HR+ LCIS had a statistically lower risk of second invasive IBCs compared to those with HR- LCIS (hazard ratio 0.356, 95% CI 0.141–0.899, P = 0.029). Women with primary HR+ LCIS had lower risks of both second total and invasive CBCs compared to those with HR- LCIS (total CBCs: hazard ratio 0.340, 95% CI 0.228–0.509, P<0.001; invasive CBCs: hazard ratio 0.172, 95% CI 0.108–0.274, P<0.001). Additionally, black women had a 2-fold risk of developing subsequent total IBCs than white women (P = 0.028). Conclusions This population-based study demonstrated that the risk of second breast cancers was significantly increased in women with HR- first LCIS compared to those with HR+ LCIS. These findings warrant intensive surveillance for second breast cancers in HR- LCIS survivors."

Pro-fibrogenic markers and Interferon Lambda (IFNL) rs8099917 genotype were measured from first available sample in all fibrosis cases (APRI ≥ 1.5 during follow-up) and the subcohort. We used Cox proportional hazards and compared Model 1 (selected clinical predictors only) to Model 2 (Model 1 plus selected markers) for predicting 3-year risk of liver fibrosis using weighted Harrell’s C and Net Reclassification Improvement indices. Results 113 individuals developed significant liver fibrosis over 1300 person-years (8.63 per 100 person-years 95% CI: 7.08, 10.60). Model 1 (age, sex, current alcohol use, HIV RNA, baseline APRI, HCV genotype) was nested in model 2, which also included IFNL genotype and IL-8, sICAM-1, RANTES, hsCRP, and sCD14. The C indexes (95% CI) for model 1 vs. model 2 were 0.720 (0.649, 0.791) and 0.756 (0.688, 0.825), respectively. Model 2 classified risk more appropriately (overall net reclassification improvement, p<0.05). Conclusions Including IFNL genotype and inflammatory markers IL-8, sICAM-1, RANTES, hs-CRP, and sCD14 enabled better prediction of the 3-year risk of significant liver fibrosis over clinical predictors alone. Whether this modest improvement in prediction justifies their additional cost requires further cost-benefit analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2611762426,"Oils extracted from the leaves of Eupatorium adenophorum were tested in vitro and in vivo against the soilborne pathogen Pythium myriotylum which causes soft rot, a devastating disease of commercial ginger production in China. Twelve compounds accounting for 99.15% of the total oil composition were identified by GC-MS. The major components were 10Hβ-9-oxo-agerophorone (37.03%), 10Hα-9-oxo-agerophorone (37.73%) and 9-oxo-10, 11-dehydro-agerophorone (23.41%). Antifungal activity was tested by the poisoned food technique against P. myriotylum, indicating minimum inhibitory concentrations of 100μg/ml after 7 days incubation. In addition, the oil extracts greatly inhibited the formation of both wet and dry mycelial biomass. The combination of E. adenophorum oil extracts and synthetic fungicides showed a strong synergistic effect, inhibiting the mycelial growth in in vitro assays. The synergistic effect of oil extracts with fungicides could allow fungicides to be used at reduced rates in the future which has environmental advantages. Oil extracts applied at 160 and 200μg/ml concentrations to ginger rhizomes before inoculation with P. myriotylum significantly reduced the infection rate in ginger. Examination by light and transmission electron microscopy revealed that oil extracts caused swelling of the hyphae, disruption of the cell wall, degradation of the cytoplasmic organelles and shortening of the cytoplasmic inclusion. These results suggested that the plasma membrane and endomembrane systems of P. myriotylum were severely damaged by the oil extracts of E. adenophorum which offer significant potential for use as a fungicide to control P. myriotylum."
https://openalex.org/W2611258360,"Rationale The human epigenome is plastic. The goal of this study was to address if fibroblast cells can be epigenetically modified to promote neovessel formation. Methods and results Here, we used highly abundant human adult dermal fibroblast cells (hADFCs) that were treated with the chromatin-modifying agents 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and subsequently subjected to differentiation by activating Wnt signaling. Our results show that these epigenetically modified hADFCs increasingly expressed β-catenin, pluripotency factor octamer-binding transcription factor-4 (OCT4, also known as POU5F1), and endothelial cell (EC) marker called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2, also known as Fetal Liver Kinase-1). In microscopic analysis, β-catenin localized to cell-cell contact points, while OCT4 was found to be localized primarily to the nucleus of these cells. Furthermore, in a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment, OCT4 bound to the VEGFR-2/FLK1 promoter. Finally, these modified hADFCs also transduced Wnt signaling. Importantly, on a two-dimensional (2D) gel substrate, a subset of the converted cells formed vascular network-like structures in the presence of VEGF. Conclusion Chromatin-modifying agents converted hADFCs to OCT4+ and VEGFR-2+ capillary tube-forming cells in a 2D matrix in VEGF-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2611632650,"This study aimed to investigate views on life and death among physicians, nurses, cancer patients, and the general population in Japan and examine factors affecting these views. We targeted 3,140 physicians, 470 nurses, 450 cancer patients, and 3,000 individuals from the general population. We used the Death Attitudes Inventory (DAI) to measure attitudes toward life and death. The collection rates were 35% (1,093/3,140), 78% (366/470), 69% (310/450), and 39% (1,180/3,000) for physicians, nurses, patients, and the general population, respectively. We found that age, sex, social role (i.e., physician, nurse, cancer patient, and general population) were significantly correlated with DAI subscales. Compared with general population, attitudes toward death of physicians, nurses and cancer patients differed significantly even after adjusted their age and sex. Our study is the first to analyze differences in views on life and death among physicians, nurses, cancer patients, and the general population in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2610259236,"In this paper, adaptive control is extended from real space to complex space, resulting in a new control scheme for a class of n-dimensional time-dependent strict-feedback complex-variable chaotic (hyperchaotic) systems (CVCSs) in the presence of uncertain complex parameters and perturbations, which has not been previously reported in the literature. In detail, we have developed a unified framework for designing the adaptive complex scalar controller to ensure this type of CVCSs asymptotically stable and for selecting complex update laws to estimate unknown complex parameters. In particular, combining Lyapunov functions dependent on complex-valued vectors and back-stepping technique, sufficient criteria on stabilization of CVCSs are derived in the sense of Wirtinger calculus in complex space. Finally, numerical simulation is presented to validate our theoretical results."
https://openalex.org/W2611076235,"Dpb11 is required for the initiation of DNA replication in budding yeast. We found that Dpb11 binds tightly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or branched DNA structures, while its human homolog, TopBP1, binds tightly to branched-DNA structures. We also found that Dpb11 binds stably to CDK-phosphorylated RPA, the eukaryotic ssDNA binding protein, in the presence of branched DNA. A Dpb11 mutant specifically defective for DNA binding did not exhibit tight binding to RPA in the presence of DNA, suggesting that Dpb11-interaction with DNA may promote the recruitment of RPA to melted DNA. We then characterized a mutant of Dpb11 that is specifically defective in DNA binding in budding yeast cells. Expression of dpb11-m1,2,3,5,ΔC results in a substantial decrease in RPA recruitment to origins, suggesting that Dpb11 interaction with DNA may be required for RPA recruitment to origins. Expression of dpb11-m1,2,3,5,ΔC also results in diminished GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 during S phase, while Cdc45 interaction with Mcm2-7 is like wild-type. The reduced GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 may be an indirect consequence of diminished origin melting. We propose that the tight interaction between Dpb11, CDK-phosphorylated RPA, and branched-DNA may be required for the essential function of stabilizing melted origin DNA in vivo. We also propose an alternative model, wherein Dpb11-DNA interaction is required for some other function in DNA replication initiation, such as helicase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2611862407,"The genes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are important to vertebrate immune system. In this study, two new MHC class I genes, designated as Egeu-UAA and Egeu-UBA, were discovered in the vulnerable Chinese egret (Egretta eulophotes). Using a full length DNA and cDNA produced by PCR and RACE methods, these two MHC class I loci were characterized in the genome of the Chinese egret and were also found to be expressed in liver and blood. Both new genes showed the expected eight exons and were similar to two copies of the minimal essential MHC complex of chicken. In genetic diversity, 14 alleles (8 for UAA and 6 for UBA) in the MHC class I gene exon 3 were found in 60 individuals using locus-specific primers and showed little polymorphism. Only three potential amino acid residues were detected under positive selection in potential peptide-binding regions (PBRs) by Bayesian analysis. These new results provide the fundamental basis for further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and significance of MHC molecular adaptation in vulnerable Chinese egret and other ardeids, finding that have not been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W2610442421,"Many studies have indicated that the expression of interleukin-21 (IL-21) is associated with the pathogenesis of certain liver diseases. However, in alternative animal models of liver diseases, it remains unknown whether the tree shrew could be utilized to analyze the relationship between IL-21 and liver diseases. Here, the phylogenetic tree, sequence alignment and protein structure model of tree shrew and human IL-21 were analyzed using bioinformatics software. A pEGFP-N3/tsIL-21 eukaryotic expression vector of tree shrew IL-21 (tsIL-21) was constructed, and IL-21 expression by the vector-transfected Huh7 cells was evaluated using the newly established quantitative real-time PCR and immunologic protocols for assessing human IL-21. The cytokine profiles were also evaluated in tree shrew spleen lymphocytes induced by recombinant human IL-21 or concanavalin A. It was found that the coding sequence (CDS) of tsIL-21 amplified from spleen lymphocytes belonged to the predicted sequence. The tsIL-21 was closely clustered with primate IL-21 rather than rodent IL-21, and it had an alignment of 83.33% with the human IL-21 nucleotide sequence and 69.93% with the amino acid sequence. The profiles of secondary structure, hydrophobicity and surface charge of tsIL-21 were also similar with those of human IL-21. The tsIL-21 expressed by the vector-transfected Huh7 cells could be identified by their different sources of antibodies against human IL-21, which were all dose-dependent. Recombinant human IL-21 could induce the change of the cytokine profiles of tree shrew spleen lymphocytes, which showed a higher expression of IL-10 and IFN-γ rather than IL-2, IL-4, IL-17, TNF-a and IL-21 during the five-day stimulation. These results indicate that tsIL-21 has a high degree of homology, structural similarity and immunological cross-reactivity with human IL-21 and also confirm the accuracy of this predicted tsIL-21CDS. The protocols utilized in this study will lead to the experimental feasibility of further IL-21-related studies in vivo."
