https://openalex.org/W2169465106,"Expression of the tumour suppressor PTEN in disseminated primary tumour cells is lost after tumour cells metastasize to the brain, with downregulation instigated by microRNAs from astrocytes, which are transferred from cell to cell by exosomes; these findings reveal the dynamic nature of metastatic cancer cells when adapting to a new tissue environment. Post-metastasis, cancer cells of common origin need to activate distinct gene expression patterns in order to adapt to a new environment. However, it is not clear when and how these adaptations to the microenvironment occur. Here, Dihua Yu and colleagues determine that tumor cell expression of the PTEN tumour suppressor is lost when these invading cells enter the brain. Downregulation of PTEN is instigated by astrocytic microRNAs, which are transferred from cell to cell through exosomes. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of metastatic cancer cells when adapting to a new tissue environment. The development of life-threatening cancer metastases at distant organs requires disseminated tumour cells’ adaptation to, and co-evolution with, the drastically different microenvironments of metastatic sites1. Cancer cells of common origin manifest distinct gene expression patterns after metastasizing to different organs2. Clearly, the dynamic interaction between metastatic tumour cells and extrinsic signals at individual metastatic organ sites critically effects the subsequent metastatic outgrowth3,4. Yet, it is unclear when and how disseminated tumour cells acquire the essential traits from the microenvironment of metastatic organs that prime their subsequent outgrowth. Here we show that both human and mouse tumour cells with normal expression of PTEN, an important tumour suppressor, lose PTEN expression after dissemination to the brain, but not to other organs. The PTEN level in PTEN-loss brain metastatic tumour cells is restored after leaving the brain microenvironment. This brain microenvironment-dependent, reversible PTEN messenger RNA and protein downregulation is epigenetically regulated by microRNAs from brain astrocytes. Mechanistically, astrocyte-derived exosomes mediate an intercellular transfer of PTEN-targeting microRNAs to metastatic tumour cells, while astrocyte-specific depletion of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte exosome secretion rescues the PTEN loss and suppresses brain metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, this adaptive PTEN loss in brain metastatic tumour cells leads to an increased secretion of the chemokine CCL2, which recruits IBA1-expressing myeloid cells that reciprocally enhance the outgrowth of brain metastatic tumour cells via enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Our findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of PTEN expression in metastatic tumour cells in response to different organ microenvironments, underpinning an essential role of co-evolution between the metastatic cells and their microenvironment during the adaptive metastatic outgrowth. Our findings signify the dynamic and reciprocal cross-talk between tumour cells and the metastatic niche; importantly, they provide new opportunities for effective anti-metastasis therapies, especially of consequence for brain metastasis patients."

https://openalex.org/W1811064827,"Integrin receptor activation initiates the formation of integrin adhesion complexes (IACs) at the cell membrane that transduce adhesion-dependent signals to control a multitude of cellular functions. Proteomic analyses of isolated IACs have revealed an unanticipated molecular complexity; however, a global view of the consensus composition and dynamics of IACs is lacking. Here, we have integrated several IAC proteomes and generated a 2,412-protein integrin adhesome. Analysis of this data set reveals the functional diversity of proteins in IACs and establishes a consensus adhesome of 60 proteins. The consensus adhesome is likely to represent a core cell adhesion machinery, centred around four axes comprising ILK–PINCH–kindlin, FAK–paxillin, talin–vinculin and α-actinin–zyxin–VASP, and includes underappreciated IAC components such as Rsu-1 and caldesmon. Proteomic quantification of IAC assembly and disassembly detailed the compositional dynamics of the core cell adhesion machinery. The definition of this consensus view of integrin adhesome components provides a resource for the research community. Humphries and colleagues analyse proteomic data of integrin adhesion complexes to derive a consensus integrin adhesome and characterize the temporal dynamics of adhesome component recruitment during adhesion complex assembly and disassembly."
https://openalex.org/W1868105705,"While isolated motor actions can be correlated with activities of neuronal networks, an unresolved problem is how the brain assembles these activities into organized behaviors like action sequences. Using brain-wide calcium imaging in Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that a large proportion of neurons across the brain share information by engaging in coordinated, dynamical network activity. This brain state evolves on a cycle, each segment of which recruits the activities of different neuronal sub-populations and can be explicitly mapped, on a single trial basis, to the animals' major motor commands. This organization defines the assembly of motor commands into a string of run-and-turn action sequence cycles, including decisions between alternative behaviors. These dynamics serve as a robust scaffold for action selection in response to sensory input. This study shows that the coordination of neuronal activity patterns into global brain dynamics underlies the high-level organization of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2143111495,"Enterococcus faecalis is both a common commensal of the human gastrointestinal tract and a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Systemic infections with multidrug-resistant enterococci occur subsequent to gastrointestinal colonization. Preventing colonization by multidrug-resistant E. faecalis could therefore be a valuable approach towards limiting infection. However, little is known about the mechanisms E. faecalis uses to colonize and compete for stable gastrointestinal niches. Pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids encoding bacteriocins are common among enterococcal strains and could modulate niche competition among enterococci or between enterococci and the intestinal microbiota. We developed a model of colonization of the mouse gut with E. faecalis, without disrupting the microbiota, to evaluate the role of the conjugative plasmid pPD1 expressing bacteriocin 21 (ref. 4) in enterococcal colonization. Here we show that E. faecalis harbouring pPD1 replaces indigenous enterococci and outcompetes E. faecalis lacking pPD1. Furthermore, in the intestine, pPD1 is transferred to other E. faecalis strains by conjugation, enhancing their survival. Colonization with an E. faecalis strain carrying a conjugation-defective pPD1 mutant subsequently resulted in clearance of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, without plasmid transfer. Therefore, bacteriocin expression by commensal bacteria can influence niche competition in the gastrointestinal tract, and bacteriocins, delivered by commensals that occupy a precise intestinal bacterial niche, may be an effective therapeutic approach to specifically eliminate intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria, without profound disruption of the indigenous microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2342639474,"While mutations in the KRAS oncogene are among the most prevalent in human cancer, there are few successful treatments to target these tumors. It is also likely that heterogeneity in KRAS-mutant tumor biology significantly contributes to the response to therapy. We hypothesized that the presence of commonly co-occurring mutations in STK11 and TP53 tumor suppressors may represent a significant source of heterogeneity in KRAS-mutant tumors. To address this, we utilized a large cohort of resected tumors from 442 lung adenocarcinoma patients with data including annotation of prevalent driver mutations (KRAS and EGFR) and tumor suppressor mutations (STK11 and TP53), microarray-based gene expression and clinical covariates, including overall survival (OS). Specifically, we determined impact of STK11 and TP53 mutations on a new KRAS mutation-associated gene expression signature as well as previously defined signatures of tumor cell proliferation and immune surveillance responses. Interestingly, STK11, but not TP53 mutations, were associated with highly elevated expression of KRAS mutation-associated genes. Mutations in TP53 and STK11 also impacted tumor biology regardless of KRAS status, with TP53 strongly associated with enhanced proliferation and STK11 with suppression of immune surveillance. These findings illustrate the remarkably distinct ways through which tumor suppressor mutations may contribute to heterogeneity in KRAS-mutant tumor biology. In addition, these studies point to novel associations between gene mutations and immune surveillance that could impact the response to immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2120451655,"Bacteria acquire memory of viral invaders by incorporating invasive DNA sequence elements into the host CRISPR locus, generating a new spacer within the CRISPR array. We report on the structures of Cas1-Cas2-dual-forked DNA complexes in an effort toward understanding how the protospacer is sampled prior to insertion into the CRISPR locus. Our study reveals a protospacer DNA comprising a 23-bp duplex bracketed by tyrosine residues, together with anchored flanking 3' overhang segments. The PAM-complementary sequence in the 3' overhang is recognized by the Cas1a catalytic subunits in a base-specific manner, and subsequent cleavage at positions 5 nt from the duplex boundary generates a 33-nt DNA intermediate that is incorporated into the CRISPR array via a cut-and-paste mechanism. Upon protospacer binding, Cas1-Cas2 undergoes a significant conformational change, generating a flat surface conducive to proper protospacer recognition. Here, our study provides important structure-based mechanistic insights into PAM-dependent spacer acquisition."
https://openalex.org/W2160375286,"Animal cell cytokinesis results from patterned activation of the small GTPase Rho, which directs assembly of actomyosin in the equatorial cortex. Cytokinesis is restricted to a portion of the cell cycle following anaphase onset in which the cortex is responsive to signals from the spindle. We show that shortly after anaphase onset oocytes and embryonic cells of frogs and echinoderms exhibit cortical waves of Rho activity and F-actin polymerization. The waves are modulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity and require the Rho GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor), Ect2. Surprisingly, during wave propagation, although Rho activity elicits F-actin assembly, F-actin subsequently inactivates Rho. Experimental and modelling results show that waves represent excitable dynamics of a reaction-diffusion system with Rho as the activator and F-actin the inhibitor. We propose that cortical excitability explains fundamental features of cytokinesis including its cell cycle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2164814134,"Interacting proteins typically coevolve, and the identification of coevolving amino acids can pinpoint residues required for interaction specificity. This approach often assumes that an interface-disrupting mutation in one protein drives selection of a compensatory mutation in its partner during evolution. However, this model requires a non-functional intermediate state prior to the compensatory change. Alternatively, a mutation in one protein could first broaden its specificity, allowing changes in its partner, followed by a specificity-restricting mutation. Using bacterial toxin-antitoxin systems, we demonstrate the plausibility of this second, promiscuity-based model. By screening large libraries of interface mutants, we show that toxins and antitoxins with high specificity are frequently connected in sequence space to more promiscuous variants that can serve as intermediates during a reprogramming of interaction specificity. We propose that the abundance of promiscuous variants promotes the expansion and diversification of toxin-antitoxin systems and other paralogous protein families during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1940906693,"The X-ray crystal structure is presented of a seven-transmembrane eukaryotic SWEET glucose transporter, revealing the link between seven-transmembrane eukaryotic SWEETs and their three-transmembrane bacterial homologues and providing insight into eukaryotic sugar transport mechanisms. SWEET sugar transporters are involved in various processes in plants and in glucose transport in animals. The authors report the first X-ray crystal structure of a eukaryotic SWEET glucose transporter, a vacuolar glucose transporter from rice. The structure (of the inward-open state) shows that this transporter forms homomeric trimers. It contains seven transmembrane helices — in contrast to the three helices reported for bacterial homologues — suggesting a molecular basis for understanding functional cross-talk and coupling of SWEET transporters. Eukaryotes rely on efficient distribution of energy and carbon skeletons between organs in the form of sugars. Glucose in animals and sucrose in plants serve as the dominant distribution forms. Cellular sugar uptake and release require vesicular and/or plasma membrane transport proteins. Humans and plants use proteins from three superfamilies for sugar translocation: the major facilitator superfamily (MFS), the sodium solute symporter family (SSF; only in the animal kingdom), and SWEETs1,2,3,4,5. SWEETs carry mono- and disaccharides6 across vacuolar or plasma membranes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in sugar translocation between compartments, cells, and organs, notably in nectar secretion7, phloem loading for long distance translocation8, pollen nutrition9, and seed filling10. Plant SWEETs cause pathogen susceptibility possibly by sugar leakage from infected cells3,11,12. The vacuolar Arabidopsis thaliana AtSWEET2 sequesters sugars in root vacuoles; loss-of-function mutants show increased susceptibility to Pythium infection13. Here we show that its orthologue, the vacuolar glucose transporter OsSWEET2b from rice (Oryza sativa), consists of an asymmetrical pair of triple-helix bundles, connected by an inversion linker transmembrane helix (TM4) to create the translocation pathway. Structural and biochemical analyses show OsSWEET2b in an apparent inward (cytosolic) open state forming homomeric trimers. TM4 tightly interacts with the first triple-helix bundle within a protomer and mediates key contacts among protomers. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the close paralogue SWEET1 from Arabidopsis identified key residues in substrate translocation and protomer crosstalk. Insights into the structure–function relationship of SWEETs are valuable for understanding the transport mechanism of eukaryotic SWEETs and may be useful for engineering sugar flux."
https://openalex.org/W2120369399,"Self-avoidance, a process preventing interactions of axons and dendrites from the same neuron during development, is mediated in vertebrates through the stochastic single-neuron expression of clustered protocadherin protein isoforms. Extracellular cadherin (EC) domains mediate isoform-specific homophilic binding between cells, conferring cell recognition through a poorly understood mechanism. Here, we report crystal structures for the EC1-EC3 domain regions from four protocadherin isoforms representing the α, β, and γ subfamilies. All are rod shaped and monomeric in solution. Biophysical measurements, cell aggregation assays, and computational docking reveal that trans binding between cells depends on the EC1-EC4 domains, which interact in an antiparallel orientation. We also show that the EC6 domains are required for the formation of cis-dimers. Overall, our results are consistent with a model in which protocadherin cis-dimers engage in a head-to-tail interaction between EC1-EC4 domains from apposed cell surfaces, possibly forming a zipper-like protein assembly, and thus providing a size-dependent self-recognition mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1773072701,"Hydrazine is an intermediate in the process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation which has a major role in the Earth’s nitrogen cycle; the crystal structure of a hydrazine synthase enzyme provides insights into the mechanism of hydrazine synthesis. Hydrazine is an intermediate in the process of anaerobic ammonium oxidation, or anammox, which has a major role in the Earth's nitrogen cycle. These authors report a 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure of a hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of hydrazine synthesis. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) has a major role in the Earth’s nitrogen cycle1,2 and is used in energy-efficient wastewater treatment3. This bacterial process combines nitrite and ammonium to form dinitrogen (N2) gas, and has been estimated to synthesize up to 50% of the dinitrogen gas emitted into our atmosphere from the oceans2. Strikingly, the anammox process relies on the highly unusual, extremely reactive intermediate hydrazine4, a compound also used as a rocket fuel because of its high reducing power. So far, the enzymatic mechanism by which hydrazine is synthesized is unknown. Here we report the 2.7 Å resolution crystal structure, as well as biophysical and spectroscopic studies, of a hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis. The structure shows an elongated dimer of heterotrimers, each of which has two unique c-type haem-containing active sites, as well as an interaction point for a redox partner. Furthermore, a system of tunnels connects these active sites. The crystal structure implies a two-step mechanism for hydrazine synthesis: a three-electron reduction of nitric oxide to hydroxylamine at the active site of the γ-subunit and its subsequent condensation with ammonia, yielding hydrazine in the active centre of the α-subunit. Our results provide the first, to our knowledge, detailed structural insight into the mechanism of biological hydrazine synthesis, which is of major significance for our understanding of the conversion of nitrogenous compounds in nature."

https://openalex.org/W1788228976,"Membrane proteins are designed to fold and function in a lipid membrane, yet folding experiments within a native membrane environment are challenging to design. Here we show that single-molecule forced unfolding experiments can be adapted to study helical membrane protein folding under native-like bicelle conditions. Applying force using magnetic tweezers, we find that a transmembrane helix protein, Escherichia coli rhomboid protease GlpG, unfolds in a highly cooperative manner, largely unraveling as one physical unit in response to mechanical tension above 25 pN. Considerable hysteresis is observed, with refolding occurring only at forces below 5 pN. Characterizing the energy landscape reveals only modest thermodynamic stability (ΔG = 6.5 kBT) but a large unfolding barrier (21.3 kBT) that can maintain the protein in a folded state for long periods of time (t1/2 ∼3.5 h). The observed energy landscape may have evolved to limit the existence of troublesome partially unfolded states and impart rigidity to the structure."
https://openalex.org/W1887973965,"Patients with advanced breast cancer often fail to respond to treatment, creating a need to develop novel biomarkers and effective therapeutics. Dopamine (DA) is a catecholamine that binds to five G protein-coupled receptors. We discovered expression of DA type-1 receptors (D1Rs) in breast cancer, thereby identifying these receptors as novel therapeutic targets in this disease. Strong to moderate immunoreactive D1R expression was found in 30% of 751 primary breast carcinomas, and was associated with larger tumors, higher tumor grades, node metastasis and shorter patient survival. DA and D1R agonists, signaling through the cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) pathway, suppressed cell viability, inhibited invasion and induced apoptosis in multiple breast cancer cell lines. Fenoldopam, a peripheral D1R agonist that does not penetrate the brain, dramatically suppressed tumor growth in two mouse models with D1R-expressing xenografts by increasing both necrosis and apoptosis. D1R-expressing primary tumors and metastases in mice were detected by fluorescence imaging. In conclusion, D1R overexpression is associated with advanced breast cancer and poor prognosis. Activation of the D1R/cGMP/PKG pathway induces apoptosis in vitro and causes tumor shrinkage in vivo. Fenoldopam, which is FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved to treat renal hypertension, could be repurposed as a novel therapeutic agent for patients with D1R-expressing tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1752520412,"Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) mediate malignant phenotypes, including metabolic reprogramming. By performing an integrative analysis of miRNA and metabolome data for the NCI-60 cell line panel, we identified an miRNA cluster strongly associated with both c-Myc expression and global metabolic variation. Within this cluster the cancer-associated and cardioprotective miR-22 was shown to repress fatty acid synthesis and elongation in tumour cells by targeting ATP citrate lyase and fatty acid elongase 6, as well as impairing mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism by suppression of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase/cyclohydrolase. Across several data sets, expression of these target genes were associated with poorer outcomes in breast cancer patients. Importantly, a beneficial effect of miR-22 on clinical outcomes in breast cancer was shown to depend on the expression levels of the identified target genes, demonstrating the relevance of miRNA/mRNA interactions to disease progression in vivo. Our systematic analysis establishes miR-22 as a novel regulator of tumour cell metabolism, a function that could contribute to the role of this miRNA in cellular differentiation and cancer development. Moreover, we provide a paradigmatic example of effect modification in outcome analysis as a consequence of miRNA-directed gene targeting, a phenomenon that could be exploited to improve patient prognosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1771139488,"Proliferations of the benthic mat-forming cyanobacteria Phormidium have been reported in rivers worldwide. Phormidium commonly produces natural toxins which pose a health risk to animal and humans. Recent field studies in New Zealand identified that sites with Phormidium proliferations consistently have low concentrations of water column dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP). Unlike other river periphyton, Phormidium mats are thick and cohesive, with water and fine sediment trapped in a mucilaginous matrix. We hypothesized that daytime photosynthetic activity would elevate pH inside the mats, and/or night time respiration would reduce dissolved oxygen. Either condition could be sufficient to facilitate desorption of phosphates from sediment incorporated within mats, thus allowing Phormidium to utilize it for growth. Using microelectrodes, optodes and pulse amplitude modulation fluorometry we demonstrated that photosynthetic activity results in elevated pH (>9) during daytime, and that night-time respiration causes oxygen depletion (<4 mg L-1) within mats. Water trapped within the mucilaginous Phormidium mat matrix had on average 320-fold higher DRP concentrations than bulk river water and this, together with elevated concentrations of elements, including iron, suggest phosphorus release from entrapped sediment. Sequential extraction of phosphorus from trapped sediment was used to investigate the role of sediment at sites on the Mangatainoka River (New Zealand) with and without Phormidium proliferations. Deposition of fine sediment (<63 μm) was significantly higher at the site with the most extensive proliferations and concentrations of biological available phosphorus were two- to four- fold higher. Collectively these results provide evidence that fine sediment can provide a source of phosphorus to support Phormidium growth and proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W1961312992,"The applications of traditional morphological and molecular methods for species identification are greatly restricted by processing speed and on a regional or greater scale are generally considered unfeasible. In this context, high-throughput sequencing, or metagenetics, has been proposed as an efficient tool to document biodiversity. Here we evaluated the effectiveness of 454 pyrosequencing in marine metazoan community analysis using the 18S rDNA: V1-V2 region. Multiplex pyrosequencing of the V1-V2 region was used to analyze two pooled samples of DNA, one comprising 118 and the other 37 morphologically identified species, and one natural sample taken directly from a North Sea zooplankton community. A DNA reference library comprising all species represented in the pooled samples was created by Sanger sequencing, and this was then used to determine the optimal similarity threshold for species delineation. The optimal threshold was found at 99% species similarity, with 85% identification success. Pyrosequencing was able to identify between fewer species: 67% and 78% of the species in the two pooled samples. Also, a large number of sequences for three species that were not included in the pooled samples were amplified by pyrosequencing, suggesting preferential amplification of some genotypes and the sensitivity of this approach to even low levels of contamination. Conversely, metagenetic analysis of the natural zooplankton sample identified many more species (particularly gelatinous zooplankton and meroplankton) than morphological analysis of a formalin-fixed sample from the same sampling site, suggesting an increased level of taxonomic resolution with pyrosequencing. The study demonstrated that, based on the V1-V2 region, 454 sequencing does not provide accurate species differentiation and reliable taxonomic classification, as it is required in most biodiversity monitoring. The analysis of artificially prepared samples indicated that species detection in pyrosequencing datasets is complicated by potential PCR-based biases and that the V1-V2 marker is poorly resolved for some taxa."
https://openalex.org/W1816316543,"The Trp53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in all human cancers. Its protein product p53 is a very powerful transcription factor that can activate different biochemical pathways and affect the regulation of metabolism, senescence, DNA damage response, cell cycle and cell death. The understanding of its function at the molecular level could be of pivotal relevance for therapy. Investigation of long-range intra- and interdomain communications in the p53 tetramer–DNA complex was performed by means of an atomistic model that included the tetramerization helices in the C-terminal domain, the DNA-binding domains and a consensus DNA-binding site of 18 base pairs. Nonsymmetric dynamics are illustrated in the four DNA-binding domains, with loop L1 switching from inward to outward conformations with respect to the DNA major groove. Direct intra- and intermonomeric long-range communications between the tetramerization and DNA-binding domains are noted. These long-distance conformational changes link the C terminus with the DNA-binding domain and provide a biophysical rationale for the reported functional regulation of the p53 C-terminal region. A fine characterization of the DNA deformation caused by p53 binding is obtained, with ‘static’ deformations always present and measured by the slide parameter in the central thymine–adenine base pairs; we also detect ‘dynamic’ deformations switched on and off by particular p53 tetrameric conformations and measured by the roll and twist parameters in the same base pairs. These different conformations can indeed modulate the electrostatic potential isosurfaces of the whole p53–DNA complex. These results provide a molecular/biophysical understanding of the evident role of the C terminus in post-translational modification that regulates the transcriptional function of p53. Furthermore, the unstructured C terminus is able to facilitate contacts between the core DNA-binding domains of the tetramer."

Here, we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of Caenorhabditis elegans causes a number of neural changes that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration. Using an unbiased genetic screen to identify genes involved in the control of P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, we identified mes-1, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein that is required for unequal cell divisions in the early embryonic germ line. We showed that sterile but not fertile mes-1 animals were resistant to neurodegeneration induced by P. aeruginosa infection. Similar results were observed using animals carrying a mutation in the maternal effect gene pgl-1, which is required for postembryonic germ line development, and the germ line-deficient strains glp-1 and glp-4. Additional studies indicated that the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is required for resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration in germ line-deficient strains.

Here, we used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the potential relationship between bacterial infection and neurodegeneration. C. elegans was chosen as a model genetic organism because of a number of traits that facilitate the study of neurodegeneration, including a hermaphroditic lifestyle, a short 2–3-week life span, and nervous system simplicity. Indeed, the C. elegans nervous system consists of only 302 neurons, which represent most types of neurons in the mammalian brain, including sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons (4Hobert O. Neurogenesis in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.WormBook. 2010; doi:10.1895/wormbook.1.12.2Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because development is reproducible among individuals, each neuron can be individually identified (5White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S.

Previous studies have shown that at least seven sensory neurons play an important role in controlling innate immunity against infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in C. elegans (18Sun J. Singh V.

Here, we first investigated whether P. aeruginosa infection causes morphological changes in the sensory neurons of C. elegans that are associated with neurodegeneration. We found that infected animals exhibited a number of neural changes that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration. To identify genes that when mutated may enhance resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, we conducted a forward genetic analysis of nematodes exhibiting enhanced resistance to killing by P. aeruginosa. We isolated a strain carrying a deletion in mes-1, which was resistant to both P. aeruginosa-mediated killing and P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration. The mes-1 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein that is required for unequal cell divisions in the early embryonic germ line. Thus, our findings indicate that the survival of neuronal cells during exposure to bacterial pathogens is controlled by the C. elegans germ line in a cell-nonautonomous manner. The C. elegans strains used in this study were wild-type N2 Bristol, OH4168 otIs151 (Pceh-36::RFP + rol-6(su1006));otEx2419 (Pgcy-1::GFP + unc-122::GFP), CX5974 kyIs262 (unc-86::myr GFP + odr-1::RFP) IV, OH3192 ntIs1(Pgcy-5::gfp + lin-15(+)), CZ1200 juIs76 (Punc-25::gfp + lin-15(+)), SS149 mes-1(bn7), and SS579 pgl-1(bn101), which were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (supported by the National Institutes of Health National Center for Research Resources). Strains AY109 mes-1(bn7);ntIs1(Pgcy-5::gfp + lin-15(+)), AY110 pgl-1(bn101);ntIs1(Pgcy-5::gfp + lin-15(+)), AY111 glp-1(e2141);ntIs1(Pgcy-5::gfp + lin-15(+)), and AY112 glp-4(bn2);ntIs1(Pgcy-5::gfp + lin-15(+)) were constructed using standard genetic manipulation techniques. The rescue strain AY113 was constructed by injecting Pmes-1::mes-1 and co-injecting the marker Punc-122::gfp into ac319 animals. C. elegans were grown and maintained at 20 °C on plates containing nematode growth medium (NGM) 2The abbreviation used is:NGMnematode growth medium. that were seeded with Escherichia coli OP50 as a food source as described previously (21Brenner S. The genetics ofCaenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) unless otherwise mentioned. The bacterial strains used were E. coli OP50 and P. aeruginosa PA14. E. coli and P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth overnight at 37 °C. nematode growth medium. Gravid adult nematodes were allowed to lay eggs on NGM plates for 3 h at 25 °C to obtain synchronized animals. The bacterial lawns used for the C. elegans killing assays were prepared by placing a 30-μl drop of an overnight culture of P. aeruginosa on modified NGM agar medium (0.35% instead of 0.25% peptone) in 3.5-cm diameter plates. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C and cooled to room temperature for at least 1 h before seeding with synchronized young adult animals. The killing assay was performed at 25 °C, and live animals were transferred daily to fresh plates. Young adult animals were used in all cases unless otherwise indicated. The scored animals were considered dead if they failed to respond to the gentle touch of a platinum wire. Three replicates were analyzed in each experiment. Ethylmethanesulfonate mutagenesis was performed using the OH3192 strain, which expresses GFP in the ASER neuron. Mutant isolation was performed as described previously (22Jorgensen E.M. Mango S.E. The art and design of genetic screens:Caenorhabditis elegans.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Briefly, early L4 larvae of OH3192 were treated with 50 mm ethylmethanesulfonate for 4 h and recovered for 2 h. Approximately 10 late L4 larvae (P0 generation) were transferred to large Petri dishes and allowed to lay ∼100 eggs of F1 progeny. The P0s were then removed, and the F1s were allowed to grow to adulthood. After 1 day of egg laying, the F1s and any hatched F2 progeny were removed by washing. The eggs of the F2s, which stuck to the plates, were allowed to develop to L4 larvae on E. coli OP50, transferred to plates containing P. aeruginosa PA14, and incubated for 72 h at 25 °C. Live worms were collected and cultured singly on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50. These worms were allowed to lay eggs overnight. Mixtures of the eggs and hatched L1 larvae were transferred to fresh NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50. After incubation for 4–5 days, the worms were lysed using a solution of sodium hydroxide and bleach (5:2 ratio) and washed, and the eggs were synchronized for 22 h in S basal liquid medium at room temperature. The synchronized L1 larvae were placed on NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and grown at 20 °C until the animals had reached the L4 larvae or young adult stage. The animals were collected and used for the survival and neurodegeneration assays on P. aeruginosa PA14. The bacterial lawns used for the neurodegeneration assay were prepared as indicated below. The bacterial lawns used for the neurodegeneration assay were prepared by placing 50 μl of an overnight culture of PA14 on modified NGM agar medium in 3.5-cm diameter plates. The full lawn plates used for the C. elegans neurodegeneration assay were prepared by spreading 50 μl of an overnight culture of PA14 over the entire surface of modified NGM agar medium in 3.5-cm diameter plates. P. aeruginosa PA14 was incubated overnight at 37 °C and then incubated at 25 °C for 24 h before seeding with synchronized animals. L4 larvae or young adult nematodes were transferred to PA14 plates and grown for 30 h at 25 °C. The animals were mounted onto agar pads and visualized using a Zeiss Axioscope microscope or Leica M165 FC microscope. The worms were analyzed for a number of morphological changes that are hallmarks of neurodegeneration, including beaded dendrites, wavy dendrites, branching dendrites, and changes in the soma described as branching. A worm was scored as exhibiting neurodegeneration when the neurons displayed the aforementioned changes. Three independent experiments were performed, and ∼60 animals were used for each experiment. Chemotaxis was studied as described previously (23Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Chemosensory neurons with overlapping functions direct chemotaxis to multiple chemicals inC. elegans.Neuron. 1991; 7: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 24Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Plasticity of chemotaxis revealed by paired presentation of a chemoattractant and starvation in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1757-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 9-cm assay plates (5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, and 2% agar) with a gradient of NaCl were used. The gradient was created by placing overnight an agar plug excised from a plate containing 100 mmol/liter NaCl. Shortly before the chemotaxis assay, the NaCl plug was removed, and 1 μl of 0.5 mol/liter sodium azide was spotted onto the same position to anesthetize the animals. As a control, sodium azide was spotted at a position ∼4 cm away from the center of the NaCl gradient. Synchronized young adult nematodes were transferred to plates seeded with E. coli or P. aeruginosa for 30 h at 25 °C. After the incubation, ∼100 animals/condition were placed equidistant (∼3 cm) from the two spots of the aforementioned 9-cm assay plates. The animals were allowed to move freely for 30 min at 25 °C. The assay plates were then chilled to 4 °C, and the number of animals around each spot was counted. The chemotaxis index was calculated as (A − B)/(N − C), where A is the number of nematodes within 1 cm of the peak of the salt gradient, B is the number of nematodes within 1 cm of the control spot, N is the number of all nematodes on the assay plate, and C is the number of animals that did not move from the original region. All of the assays were conducted independently in triplicate. RNA interference was used to generate loss-of-function RNAi phenotypes by feeding nematodes E. coli strain HT115 expressing double-stranded RNA homologous to the target gene daf-16. E. coli HT115 strain was grown in LB broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C overnight and plated onto NGM containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The dsRNA-expressing bacteria were allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. L2 or L3 larval animals were placed on RNAi or vector control plates for 3 days at 15 °C until the nematodes became gravid. Gravid adults were then transferred to fresh RNAi-expressing bacterial lawns and allowed to lay eggs at 25 °C for 2 h to synchronize a second-generation RNAi population. After removing the adults, the hatched eggs and nematodes were grown at 25 °C for 60 h. unc-22 RNAi served as a control. Animal survival was plotted as a nonlinear regression curve using Prism (version 4.00) (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The survival curves were considered significantly different from the control when the p values were <0.05. Prism uses the product limit or Kaplan-Meier method to calculate survival fractions and the log-rank test, which is equivalent to the Mantel-Haenszel test, to compare survival curves. A two-sample Student's t test for independent samples was used to analyze the neurodegeneration rate, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise indicated. To investigate the effect of bacterial infection on sensory neurons, we infected animals expressing RFP or GFP in amphid neurons with P. aeruginosa strain PA14. We found that the sensory neurons of animals infected with P. aeruginosa exhibited a number of morphological changes that can be considered hallmarks of neurodegeneration. These morphological changes included beaded dendrites, wavy dendrites, branching dendrites, and changes in the soma described as branching (Fig. 1A). Strain OH4168, which expresses a ceh-36::rfp transgene that allows visualization of ASE neurons (25O'Meara M.M. Bigelow H. Flibotte S. Etchberger J.F. Moerman D.G. Hobert O. Cis-regulatory mutations in theCaenorhabditis elegans homeobox gene locus cog-1 affect neuronal development.Genetics. 2009; 181: 1679-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), exhibited a number of morphological changes associated with neurodegeneration 30 h after infection with P. aeruginosa (Fig. 1B). These changes were confirmed using strain OH3192, which expresses GFP only in the ASER neuron driven by the promoter of the gcy-5 gene (26Zheng G. Cochella L. Liu J. Hobert O. Li W.H. Temporal and spatial regulation of microRNA activity with photoactivatable cantimirs.ACS Chem. Biol. 2011; 6: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 27Doerks T. Copley R.R. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Systematic identification of novel protein domain families associated with nuclear functions.Genome Res. 2002; 12: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Similar changes were induced by P. aeruginosa infection in strain CX5974 (Fig. 1C). This strain uses the odr-1 promoter to express RFP in AWC, AWB, and I1 neurons (28Chen L. Fu Y. Ren M. Xiao B. Rubin C.S. A RasGRPC. elegans RGEF-1b, couples external stimuli to behavior by activating LET-60 (Ras) in sensory neurons.Neuron. 2011; 70: 51-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but only AWC can be observed in the confocal plane. None of these changes were observed when the animals were exposed for 30 h to E. coli OP50 (Fig. 1, B and C), which is the normal food source of C. elegans in the laboratory. These results indicated that exposure to pathogenic bacteria resulted in neurodegeneration. Although Fig. 1, B and C, shows important changes related to neurodegeneration, we performed a functional assay to address the function of ASE neurons after infection with P. aeruginosa. We took advantage of chemotaxis toward NaCl, which is uniquely controlled by ASE sensory neurons (23Bargmann C.I. Horvitz H.R. Chemosensory neurons with overlapping functions direct chemotaxis to multiple chemicals inC. elegans.Neuron. 1991; 7: 729-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the chemotaxis toward NaCl of strain OH3192 cultured on E. coli or P. aeruginosa plates. As shown in Fig. 1D, P. aeruginosa infection caused a significant decrease in chemotaxis toward NaCl, which indicated that the infection not only affected neural morphology but also impaired ASE function. Chemosensation is used by C. elegans to search for food or to avoid noxious conditions (29Bargmann C.I. Chemosensation inC. elegans.WormBook. 2006; doi:10.1895/wormbook.1.123.1Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Indeed, pathogen avoidance is part of the defense response of C. elegans against P. aeruginosa infection (20Singh V. Aballay A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 33191-33197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Styer K.L. Singh V. Macosko E. Steele S.E. Bargmann C.I. Aballay A.

Youngman M.J. Kim D.H. Transcriptional responses to pathogens inCaenorhabditis elegans.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To assess whether pathogen avoidance protects C. elegans against neurodegeneration induced by P. aeruginosa infection, assays were performed in plates containing partial or full lawns of P. aeruginosa. By infecting the animals on full lawns of P. aeruginosa, the ability to reduce pathogen exposure by leaving the lawn is eliminated. Consistent with the idea that pathogen avoidance protects against P. aeruginosa infection, animals grown on full lawns of P. aeruginosa exhibited significantly increased neurodegeneration compared with those grown on partial lawns (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2A). The exposure of animals on partial lawns of P. aeruginosa resulted in only moderate neurodegeneration (Fig. 2A). To examine the susceptibility of animals at different developmental stages to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, L1 larvae, L4 larvae, young adults, or 2-day-old nematodes were infected. P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration was increased in L1 larvae compared with L4 larvae, young adults, or 2-day-old animals (Fig. 2B), suggesting that larval neurons may be more susceptible to P. aeruginosa-mediated neurodegeneration than adult neurons. We also examined the susceptibility of motor neurons to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration. P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration in strain OH3192 was compared with that induced in CZ1200 animals, which express GFP in GABAergic motor neurons (Fig. 2C). The results indicated that sensory neurons were more sensitive to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration than motor neurons. We also assessed whether osmotic stress could induce neurodegeneration. Similarly to P. aeruginosa exposure, osmotic stress caused by exposure to 450 or 500 mm NaCl killed 50–60% of the animals after 48 h of exposure (Fig. 3A). Although osmotic stress initially killed C. elegans more rapidly than P. aeruginosa (Fig. 3A), it did not induce significant neurodegeneration (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that neurodegeneration induced by P. aeruginosa infection was not due to the premature death of the animals. To identify C. elegans mutants that were resistant to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, we used a forward genetic screen. First, 340 mutagenized OH3192 nematodes were used to isolate mutants with enhanced resistance to pathogen infection. Of the five initial mutants isolated, only three exhibited significant resistance to P. aeruginosa-mediated killing after four backcrosses (Fig. 4, A–E). Mutant 319 was named ac319 and chosen for further analysis based on its strong resistance to pathogen infection. In addition, compared with other mutants, the ac319 mutant exhibited the most highly significant enhanced resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration (Fig. 4F). Interestingly, among all of the isolated mutants, the ac319 mutant segregated both fertile animals and sterile animals that did not exhibit a germ line (Fig. 5A). Because a number of germ line-deficient mutants are temperature-sensitive (33Pepper A.S.R. Killian D.J. Hubbard E.J.A. Genetic analysis ofCaenorhabditis elegans glp-1 mutants suggests receptor interaction or competition.Genetics. 2003; 163: 115-132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Beanan M.J. Strome S. Characterization of a germ-line proliferation mutation inC. elegans.Development. 1992; 116: 755-766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to assess the sterility of ac319 animals at 15, 20, or 25 °C individually. We found that the percentage of sterile nematodes increased with the rising temperature (Fig. 5B).FIGURE 5Mutant ac319 exhibits a maternal effect sterile phenotype.

C, 12 fertile ac319 young adult animals were individually cultured for 24 h, and their progeny were scored for sterility after growth for 3 days at 20 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the aforementioned sterile phenotype of the ac319 mutants was not due to heterozygosity, we analyzed the percentage of germ line-deficient animals among the progeny of fertile ac319 mutants. We found that 40–50% of the progeny of the ac319 animals were sterile (Fig. 5C), indicating that a maternal effect sterile mutation caused the offspring of homozygous mutant mothers to develop into sterile adults. Further analysis revealed that the ac319 mutants with normal germ lines survived as long as the wild-type animals following exposure to P. aeruginosa, whereas the germ line-deficient ac319 mutants exhibited greater resistance to P. aeruginosa infection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). The germ line-deficient animals also displayed a strong resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, whereas the fertile animals demonstrated neurodegeneration comparable with that of control animals (Fig. 6, B and C). These results suggested that germ line-deficient animals might be more resistant to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration. As a first step in the identification of the ac319 mutation, we sequenced genes that are known to cause germ line deficiency and enhanced resistance to pathogen killing, including glp-1, mes-1, and pgl-1 (35TeKippe M. Aballay A. C. elegans germline-deficient mutants respond to pathogen infection using shared and distinct mechanisms.PloS One. 2010; 5: e11777Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 36Sinha A.

Chem. 2010; 285: 1822-1828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We did not identify mutations in the glp-1 or pgl-1 genes in the ac319 mutant animals. However, using flanking primers, we initially failed to amplify and sequence the mes-1 gene in ac319 animals. Further analysis showed that ac319 animals carry an 11,490-bp deletion on chromosome X that ranges from 18,338 to 29,827 (Fig. 7A). This deletion encompasses three genes, including xtr-1, F54F7.8, and mes-1. The mes-1 gene encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase-like protein that is required for unequal cell division in the early embryonic germ line (38Berkowitz L.A. Strome S. MES-1, a protein required for unequal divisions of the germline in earlyC. elegans embryos, resembles receptor tyrosine kinases and is localized to the boundary between the germline and gut cells.Development. 2000; 127: 4419-4431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, animals carrying mutations in mes-1 exhibit a maternal effect sterility phenotype similar to that observed in ac319 mutants (39Arantes-Oliveira N. Apfeld J. Dillin A. Kenyon C. Regulation of life-span by germ-line stem cells inCaenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2002; 295: 502-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to study the susceptibility of mes-1(bn7) animals to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration. To observe neurodegeneration, mes-1(bn7) was crossed with strain OH3192. As shown in Fig. 7B, sterile but not fertile mes-1(bn7) animals were resistant to neurodegeneration induced by P. aeruginosa infection. Similar results were observed using OH3192 animals carrying a mutation in the maternal effect gene pgl-1(bn101), which is required for postembryonic germ line development (Fig. 7B). To confirm that the absence of mes-1 caused the ac319 animals to become resistant to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration, we created ac319 animals expressing mes-1 under its own promoter. As shown in Fig. 7B, the enhanced resistance to neurodegeneration of ac319 animals was completely abolished in these animals. The expression of mes-1 also rescued the sterility of the ac319 animals (data not shown). We used two additional germ line-deficient mutants, glp-1(e2141) and glp-4(bn2), to further investigate the role of sterility in resistance to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration. Both glp-1(e2141) and glp-4(bn2) animals displayed reduced levels of neurodegeneration following P. aeruginosa infection (Fig. 7C), confirming that sterility may confer protective effects to neurons in response to pathogen infection. Taken together, these results suggest that the deletion of mes-1 in ac319 animals may be responsible for the maternal effect sterility and enhanced resistance to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration and that sterile animals more efficiently deal with the deleterious consequences of bacterial infections compared with wild-type animals. The FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 is known to control a variety of physiological processes in C. elegans, including longevity, the stress response, and immunity (40Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A.

Regulation of DAF-16-mediated innate immunity inC. elegans.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35580-35587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether the enhanced resistance to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration of mes-1(bn7) animals also required DAF-16 activity. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down DAF-16 activity in mes-1(bn7) animals. The resistance of mes-1(bn7) animals to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration was significantly reduced by daf-16 RNAi (Fig. 8). DAF-16 was also required for resistance to the pathogen-induced neurodegeneration of glp-1(e2141) animals (Fig. 8). However, daf-16 RNAi did not fully suppress the enhanced resistance to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration of mes-1(bn7) or glp-1(e2141) animals, indicating that some other factors might be involved in this process. Increasing evidence indicate that microbial infections and neuroinflammation can potentially trigger neurodegenerative diseases. Given the molecular conservation of neuronal signaling pathways across vertebrates and invertebrates, a number of investigators have utilized the nematode C. elegans to study the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disease pathology. Here, we sought to investigate the potential relationship between bacterial infection and neurodegeneration using C. elegans. Our findings indicate that host changes induced by P. aeruginosa infection result in axonal degeneration and aberrant neuronal sprouting similar to that observed in aged animals and patients with neurodegenerative disorders. To study the neurodegeneration induced by P. aeruginosa infection, we used three C. elegans strains that express fluorescent proteins in sensory neurons and discovered four types of morphological changes, including beaded dendrites, branched somas, wavy dendrites, and branched dendrites (Fig. 1). In C. elegans, novel outgrowth phenotypes, including branching from the main dendrite or new growth from the soma, appear at a high frequency in some aging touch neurons, but the incidence of beads and protrusions declines in older PLM neurons (9Toth M.L. Melentijevic I. Shah L. Bhatia A. Lu K. Talwar A. Naji H. Ibanez-Ventoso C. Ghose P. Jevince A. Xue J. Herndon L.A. Bhanot G. Rongo C. Hall D.H. Driscoll M. Neurite sprouting and synapse deterioration in the agingCaenorhabditis elegans nervous system.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8778-8790Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We found that P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration results in both new dendrite growth and the generation of beads and protrusions, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in neurodegeneration caused by aging or pathogen infection. To provide insight regarding the molecular mechanisms that regulate P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration, we employed an unbiased forward genetics approach that resulted in the isolation of a mutant carrying a deletion that includes the mes-1 gene. In subsequent studies, we demonstrated that animals carrying mutations in the maternal effect sterility genes mes-1 or pgl-1, which are required for postembryonic germ line development, were resistant to P. aeruginosa-induced neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that germ line loss results in resistance to pathogen-induced neurodegeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2222243139,"Objective 
Clinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of interventions to reduce neonatal deaths, but there are fewer studies of their real-life effectiveness. In India, women often seek facility delivery after complications arise, rather than to avoid complications. Our objective was to quantify the association of facility delivery and postnatal checkups with neonatal mortality while examining the “reverse causality” in which the mothers deliver at a health facility due to adverse perinatal events.
Methods 
We conducted nationally representative case-control studies of about 300,000 live births and 4,000 neonatal deaths to examine the effect of, place of delivery and postnatal checkup on neonatal mortality. We compared neonatal deaths to all live births and to a subset of live births reporting excessive bleeding or obstructed labour that were more comparable to cases in seeking care.
Findings 
In the larger study of 2004–8 births, facility delivery without postnatal checkup was associated with an increased odds of neonatal death (Odds ratio = 2.5; 99% CI 2.2–2.9), especially for early versus late neonatal deaths. However, use of more comparable controls showed marked attenuation (Odds ratio = 0.5; 0.4–0.5). Facility delivery with postnatal checkup was associated with reduced odds of neonatal death. Excess risks were attenuated in the earlier study of 2001–4 births.
Conclusion 
The combined effect of facility deliveries with postnatal checks ups is substantially higher than just facility delivery alone. Evaluation of the real-life effectiveness of interventions to reduce child and maternal deaths need to consider reverse causality. If these associations are causal, facility delivery with postnatal check up could avoid about 1/3 of all neonatal deaths in India (~100,000/year)."
https://openalex.org/W2340199764,"Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase (RCA) is a nuclear gene that encodes a chloroplast protein that plays an important role in photosynthesis. Some reports have indicated that it may play a role in acclimation to different abiotic stresses. In this paper, we analyzed the stress-responsive elements in the 2.0 kb 5'-upstream regions of the RCA gene promoter and the primary, secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. We identified some cis-elements of multiple stress-related components in the RCA promoter. Amino acid and evolution analyses showed that the RCA protein had conserved regions between different species; however, the size and type varied. The secondary structures, binding sites and tertiary structures of the RCA proteins were also different. This might reflect the differences in the transcription and translation levels of the two RCA isoforms during adaptation to different abiotic stresses. Although both the transcription and translation levels of RCA isoforms in the rice leaves increased under various stresses, the large isoform was increased more significantly in the chloroplast stroma and thylakoid. It can be concluded that RCA, especially RCAL, is also a multiple responder to abiotic stresses in rice, which provides new insights into RCA functions."
https://openalex.org/W2258332806,"The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) controls synaptic plasticity and memory function and is one of the major inducers of transcription factor Egr-1 in the hippocampus. However, how Egr-1 mediates the NMDAR signal in neurons has remained unclear. Here, we show that the hippocampus of mice lacking Egr-1 displays electrophysiology properties and ultrastructure that are similar to mice overexpressing PSD-95, a major scaffolding protein of postsynaptic density involved in synapse formation, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors (AMPARs), which mediate the vast majority of excitatory transmission in the CNS. We demonstrate that Egr-1 is a transcription repressor of the PSD-95 gene and is recruited to the PSD-95 promoter in response to NMDAR activation. Knockdown of Egr-1 in rat hippocampal primary neurons blocks NMDAR-induced PSD-95 down-regulation and AMPAR endocytosis. Likewise, overexpression of Egr-1 in rat hippocampal primary neurons causes reduction in PSD-95 protein level and promotes AMPAR endocytosis. Our data indicate that Egr-1 is involved in NMDAR-mediated PSD-95 down-regulation and AMPAR endocytosis, a process important in the expression of long term depression."
https://openalex.org/W1809878175,"Despite recent insights into prostate cancer (PCa)-associated genetic changes, full understanding of prostate tumorigenesis remains elusive owing to complexity of interactions among various cell types and soluble factors present in prostate tissue. We found the upregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) in human PCa and cultured PCa cells, but not in normal prostates and non-tumorigenic prostate cells. To understand the role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis in situ, we temporally and spatially controlled the activation of NFATc1 in mouse prostate and showed that such activation resulted in prostatic adenocarcinoma with features similar to those seen in human PCa. Our results indicate that the activation of a single transcription factor, NFATc1 in prostatic luminal epithelium to PCa can affect expression of diverse factors in both cells harboring the genetic changes and in neighboring cells through microenvironmental alterations. In addition to the activation of oncogenes c-MYC and STAT3 in tumor cells, a number of cytokines and growth factors, such as IL1β, IL6 and SPP1 (osteopontin, a key biomarker for PCa), were upregulated in NFATc1-induced PCa, establishing a tumorigenic microenvironment involving both NFATc1 positive and negative cells for prostate tumorigenesis. To further characterize interactions between genes involved in prostate tumorigenesis, we generated mice with both NFATc1 activation and Pten inactivation in prostate. We showed that NFATc1 activation led to acceleration of Pten null-driven prostate tumorigenesis by overcoming the PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence through inhibition of p21 activation. This study provides direct in vivo evidence of an oncogenic role of NFATc1 in prostate tumorigenesis and reveals multiple functions of NFATc1 in activating oncogenes, in inducing proinflammatory cytokines, in oncogene addiction, and in overcoming cellular senescence, which suggests calcineurin-NFAT signaling as a potential target in preventing PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2194420357,"The BRAF(V600E) mutation is found in approximately 40% of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC). Mice with thyroid-specific expression of Braf(V600E) (TPO-Braf(V600E)) develop PTC rapidly with high levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It is unclear to what extent the elevated TSH contributes to tumor progression. To investigate the progression of Braf(V600E)-induced PTC (BVE-PTC) under normal TSH, we transplanted BVE-PTC tumors subcutaneously into nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. Regression of the transplanted tumors was observed in both nude and TPO-Braf(WT) mice. They were surrounded by heavy lymphocyte infiltration and oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) was demonstrated by strong β-gal staining and absence of Ki-67 expression. In contrast, BVE-PTC transplants continued to grow when transplanted into TPO-Braf(V600E) mice. The expression of Trp53 was increased in tumor transplants undergoing OIS. Trp53 inactivation reversed OIS and enabled tumor transplants to grow in nude mice with characteristic cell morphology of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). PTC-to-ATC transformation was also observed in primary BVE-PTC tumors. ATC cells derived from Trp53 knockout tumors had increased PI3K/AKT signaling and became resistant to Braf(V600E) inhibitor PLX4720, which could be overcome by combined treatment of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and PLX4720. In conclusion, BVE-PTC progression could be contained via p53-dependent OIS and TSH is a major disruptor of this balance. Simultaneous targeting of both MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways offer a better therapeutic outcome against ATC. The current study reinforces the importance of rigorous control of serum TSH in PTC patients."
https://openalex.org/W1749752941,"The MST1R gene is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer producing elevated levels of the RON tyrosine kinase receptor protein. While mutations in MST1R are rare, alternative splice variants have been previously reported in epithelial cancers. We report the discovery of a novel RON isoform discovered in human pancreatic cancer. Partial splicing of exons 5 and 6 (P5P6) produces a RON isoform that lacks the first extracellular immunoglobulin-plexin-transcription domain. The splice variant is detected in 73% of xenografts derived from pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients and 71% of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Peptides specific to RON P5P6 detected in human pancreatic cancer specimens by mass spectrometry confirm translation of the protein isoform. The P5P6 isoform is found to be constitutively phosphorylated, present in the cytoplasm, and it traffics to the plasma membrane. Expression of P5P6 in immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE) cells activates downstream AKT, and in human pancreatic epithelial nestin-expressing cells, activates both the AKT and MAPK pathways. Inhibiting RON P5P6 in HPDE cells using a small molecule inhibitor BMS-777607 blocked constitutive activation and decreased AKT signaling. P5P6 transforms NIH3T3 cells and induces tumorigenicity in HPDE cells. Resultant HPDE-P5P6 tumors develop a dense stromal compartment similar to that seen in pancreatic cancer. In summary, we have identified a novel and constitutively active isoform of the RON tyrosine kinase receptor that has transforming activity and is expressed in human pancreatic cancer. These findings provide additional insight into the biology of the RON receptor in pancreatic cancer and are clinically relevant to the study of RON as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2174570955,"Proton radiotherapy is becoming more common as protons induce more precise DNA damage at the tumor site with reduced side effects to adjacent normal tissues. However, the long-term biological effects of proton irradiation in cancer initiation compared with conventional photon irradiation are poorly characterized. In this study, using a human familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome susceptible mouse model, we show that whole-body irradiation with protons are more effective in inducing senescence-associated inflammatory responses (SIRs), which are involved in colon cancer initiation and progression. After proton irradiation, a subset of SIR genes (Troy, Sox17, Opg, Faim2, Lpo, Tlr2 and Ptges) and a gene known to be involved in invasiveness (Plat), along with the senescence-associated gene (P19Arf), are markedly increased. Following these changes, loss of Casein kinase Iα and induction of chronic DNA damage and TP53 mutations are increased compared with X-ray irradiation. Proton irradiation also increases the number of colonic polyps, carcinomas and invasive adenocarcinomas. Pretreatment with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid–ethyl amide (CDDO-EA), reduces proton irradiation-associated SIR and tumorigenesis. Thus exposure to proton irradiation elicits significant changes in colorectal cancer initiation and progression that can be mitigated using CDDO-EA."
https://openalex.org/W1781506389,"Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. However, little is known about regulatory mechanisms of the β-catenin activity in cancer progression. Here we investigated the role of DBC1, which was recently reported as a negative regulator of SIRT1 and a transcriptional coactivator, in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We identified the genome-wide targets of DBC1 and found that loss of DBC1 inhibits the expression of β-catenin target genes including PROX1, a transcription factor linked to CRC progression. Mechanistically, DBC1 stabilizes LEF1–β-catenin interaction by inhibiting SIRT1-mediated β-catenin deacetylation, thereby enhancing LEF1–β-catenin complex formation and long-range chromatin looping at the PROX1 locus. Furthermore, DBC1 is also required for the transcriptional activity of PROX1, suggesting that DBC1 has a dual function in regulating β-catenin–PROX1 signaling axis: as a coactivator for both β-catenin and PROX1. Importantly, loss of DBC1 inhibited growth and tumorigenic potential of colon cancer cells, and DBC1 expression correlated with shorter relapse-free survival in patients with advanced CRC. Our results firmly establish DBC1 as a critical positive regulator of β-catenin–PROX1 signaling axis and a key factor in β-catenin–PROX1-mediated CRC progression."
https://openalex.org/W1814699056,"E-cadherin is a cell adhesion molecule best known for its function in suppressing tumor progression and metastasis. Here we show that E-cadherin promotes nucleotide excision repair through positively regulating the expression of xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) and DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1). Loss of E-cadherin activates the E2F4 and p130/107 transcription repressor complexes to suppress the transcription of both XPC and DDB1 through activating the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. Adding XPC or DDB1, or inhibiting the TGF-β pathway, increases the repair of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage in E-cadherin-inhibited cells. In the mouse skin and skin tumors, UVB radiation downregulates E-cadherin. In sun-associated premalignant and malignant skin neoplasia, E-cadherin is downregulated in association with reduced XPC and DDB1 levels. These findings demonstrate a crucial role of E-cadherin in efficient DNA repair of UV-induced DNA damage, identify a new link between epithelial adhesion and DNA repair and suggest a mechanistic link of early E-cadherin loss in tumor initiation."

The iSH2 domain binds to the N-terminal adaptor-binding domain of p110α, p110β, and p110δ, yielding a stable low activity heterodimer. Activation of p85/p110 heterodimers by receptor tyrosine kinases requires binding of the nSH2 and cSH2 domains to phosphorylated YXXM motifs in the receptor tyrosine kinases themselves or in adaptors like IRS-1, which relieves inhibitory contacts between the SH2 domains and p110 (2.Burke J.E.

Our study provides new insight into p85α dimerization, suggesting that p85α is a highly dynamic molecule whose conformational flexibility allows it to efficiently exchange among multiple binding partners. Wild-type human p85α was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 bacterial expression vector (GE Healthcare) using the BamHI-EcoRI sites. Its six cysteines were mutated (C146S, C167S, C498S, C656S, C659V, and C670L) to generate cysteine-free p85α. Hereafter, we refer to “cysteine-free p85α” as p85α and the wild type protein as “native p85α.” Similarly, truncation mutants will be referred to as p85α with superscripts denoting the residues included in the fragment. The construct coding for p85α was expressed in BL21-CodonPlus competent cells (Agilent Technologies), which were induced overnight with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 25 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended on ice in lysis buffer (PBS containing 4 mm DTT, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, 2.5 units/ml Pierce universal nuclease for cell lysis (Thermo Scientific) and Roche cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were lysed by sonication in an ice bath using a Branson sonicator with a microprobe tip at output level 5 for 30 s followed by 30 s on ice for five cycles. The lysate was brought to 1% Triton X-100, incubated for 20 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with Pierce glutathione-agarose (Thermo Scientific) for 2–4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The resin was washed three times by resuspension in 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. p85α was cleaved from the GST with PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C in cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0) on a rotating wheel. The resin was transferred to a chromatography column, and supernatant containing the cleaved protein was collected, along with two washes of 1 column volume of cleavage buffer each. The PreScission cleavage reaction leaves five residues (GPLGS) at the N terminus preceding the p85α sequence. The resultant p85α was dialyzed overnight into Mono Q buffer (20 mm Tris, 20 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), loaded onto a Mono Q 10/100 GL anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a 0–350 mm NaCl gradient over 40 column volumes. The peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and those containing >95% pure p85α were pooled and concentrated for use or storage at −80 °C. Stored protein was thawed on ice and centrifuged using a TLA-120.2 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 80,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C prior to use. Protein concentrations were measured using UV absorbance at 280 nm (Nanodrop 2000 UV-visible spectrophotometer, Thermo Scientific) and corresponding extinction coefficients were calculated from protein sequences using ExPASy ProtParam. Protein mass was confirmed via mass spectrometry to be 83,938.6 Da (based on the sequence, the calculated mass is 83,951.6 Da). Truncated fragments of p85α (Fig. 1) were expressed from the corresponding cDNAs that were synthesized by PCR and ligated into pGEX-6P-1 using the BamHI-EcoRI sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. The truncated fragments of p85α were expressed and purified using the same protocol described for the full-length protein. For binding assays, native GST-p85α and GST-p85α were purified as described above except that p85α was not cleaved from the glutathione-agarose. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining were used to quantitate bead-bound GST fusion proteins. Beads were either stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week or frozen in 50% glycerol at −20 °C. HEK293T cells were transfected with wild-type N-Myc-p110α using Fugene HD for 48 h. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, Nonidet P-40; 150 μm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, cOmplete protein inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma)), followed by incubation on a rotating wheel for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The clarified supernatant was then incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads or beads complexed with GST-p85α or native GST-p85α. The beads were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and once with PBS and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blotted with an anti-Myc antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and developed with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). For Rac binding, GST-Rac was bacterially produced and bound to glutathione-Sepharose, followed by loading without or with GTPγS (21.Fritsch R. de Krijger I. Fritsch K. George R. Reason B. Kumar M.S. Diefenbacher M. Stamp G. Downward J.

The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and once with PBS and boiled in 2× Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were blotted with in-house anti-p85α-nSH2 antibody and developed with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce). N-Myc-p110α was immunopurified from transiently transfected HEK293T cells as above. Protein-G pellets were washed, incubated without or with bacterially produced GST-p85α or native GST-p85α, and assayed for lipid kinase activity as described previously (22.Yu J. Zhang Y. McIlroy J. Rordorf-Nikolic T. Orr G.A. Backer J.M. Regulation of the p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase: stabilization and inhibition of the p110α catalytic subunit by the p85 regulatory subunit.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-p85α-cSH2 and native GST-p85α-cSH2 constructs (residues 617–724) were expressed in BL-21 Escherichia coli, processed as above, and partially purified by elution with 20 mm glutathione from glutathione-Sepharose beads. A tyrosine phosphopeptide containing the photoactivatable amino acid benzoyl phenylalanine (Bpa) (Gly-Asp-Gly-Tyr(P)-Bpa-Pro-Met-Ser-Pro-Lys-Ser) was N-terminally labeled with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent and desalted by chromatography on Sephadex G-10. The labeled peptide (4.7 μm final, 3 × 106 cpm/assay) was incubated with 2 μg of GST-cSH2 domain in the absence or presence of 250 μm unlabeled peptide. The samples were irradiated on ice with a 200-nm UV lamp at a distance of 1 cm for 1 h, boiled in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. AUC studies were conducted with a Beckman Optima XL-I centrifuge using the AN-60Ti rotor. The absorption optics were set to 280 nm. Protein samples were run in either the low or high salt SAXS buffers described below at temperatures ranging from 4 to 37 °C. An SH3-binding peptide (RPLPPRPGA) used to inhibit dimerization was synthesized by GenScript and kept at −20 °C as a concentrated stock solution that was thawed and diluted into the buffer appropriate for each experiment. Sednterp (available online from the University of New Hampshire) was used to calculate the partial specific volume of the proteins from their sequence and the density and viscosity of the buffers. The sedimentation parameters were corrected to standard conditions (20,w) using these values. For sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments, 300 μl of sample and an equal volume of buffer were loaded into two-sector cell assemblies. Three concentrations of each protein corresponding to A280 ∼0.1, 0.4, and 1.0 (equivalent to 1.2, 3.6, and 9.6 μm p85α monomer) were analyzed for each solution condition. 60–70 scans were collected over the course of a sedimentation velocity run. A subset of scans, beginning with those where a clear plateau was evident between the meniscus and the boundary, were selected for time-derivative analysis using DCDT+ version 2.4.2 (23.Philo J.S. Improved methods for fitting sedimentation coefficient distributions derived by time-derivative techniques.Anal.

Boundary analysis in sedimentation transport experiments: a procedure for obtaining sedimentation coefficient distributions using the time derivative of the concentration profile.Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The SV experiments presented in this paper were conducted at 42,000 rpm. For sedimentation equilibrium (SEQ) experiments, 120 μl each of sample and buffer were loaded into six-channel cell assemblies at the concentrations noted above. Data were taken following initial equilibration for 24 h at the indicated speed and then following a second 24-h equilibration at higher speed. Scans were also taken after 22 h so that equilibration could be confirmed. The p85α EQ experiments were equilibrated at 8,000 and then 16,000 rpm; p85α(1–600) was equilibrated at 9,000 and then 16,000 rpm; p85α(1–432) was equilibrated at 10,000 and then 20,000 rpm; p85α(1–333) was equilibrated at18,000 and then 25,000 rpm; and p85α(78–322) was equilibrated at 20,000 and then 30,000 rpm. The equilibrium experiments were globally analyzed using HeteroAnalysis version 1.1.58 (25.Cole J.L.

Native p85α was also used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of proline residues 96 and 99 to alanine and methionine 176 to alanine (PR1/M176A). FFS experiments were performed on a home-built two-photon fluorescence fluctuation microscope described previously (27.Wu B. Chao J.A. Singer R.H. Fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy enables quantitative imaging of single mRNAs in living cells.Biophys. J. 2012; 102: 2936-2944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which is composed of an Olympus IX-71 and a mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra, Coherent). A ×60 Plan-Apo oil immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.4; Olympus) was used to focus the laser and collect the fluorescence. Two short pass filters (ET680sp-2p8, Chroma) eliminated scattered laser light. A band pass emission filter further filtered the fluorescence (FF01-525/50-01, Semrock). An avalanche photodiode detector (SPCM-AQR-14, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was directly connected to a data acquisition card (FLEX02, Correlator.com). The recorded photon counts were stored and later analyzed with programs written in IDL (ITT Exelis). The normalized brightness b (28.Chen Y. Wei L.N. Müller J.D.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15492-15497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) is defined as b = λapp/λEGFP, which measures the oligomerization of the target protein. The sample apparent brightness λapp is measured by generalized Mandel's Q parameter analysis (29.Sanchez-Andres A. Chen Y. Müller J.D. Molecular brightness determined from a generalized form of Mandel's Q-parameter.Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 3531-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The brightness λEGFP is obtained in calibration experiments by measuring cells transfected with EGFP. p85α and p85α(1–333) (Fig. 1B) were dialyzed into 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm NaCl, a solution condition that favors p85α dimerization (Fig. 3A). 12 μm p85α was incubated with 0.5 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) for 15 min on ice with gentle agitation. 30 μm p85α(1–333) was incubated with a 50-fold molar excess of disuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) freshly prepared in 100% DMSO for 15 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. The DSS and DST cross-linking reactions were quenched with the addition of Tris to a final concentration of 100 mm. Dimer formation was assessed using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. After electrophoresis, the gel region corresponding to p85α or p85α(1–333) dimer was excised and digested in-gel with trypsin to release the cross-linked peptides. The samples were processed and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (30.Shi Y. Fernandez-Martinez J. Tjioe E. Pellarin R. Kim S.J. Williams R. Schneidman-Duhovny D. Sali A. Rout M.P.

After proteolysis, cross-linked peptides were extracted, dried in a SpeedVac (Savant), and desalted/purified on a C18 solid phase extraction column (Waters). Next, the cross-linked peptides were enriched by size exclusion chromatography and analyzed by an Orbitrap Q Exactive (QE) Plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The QE Plus instrument was directly coupled to an EasyLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cross-linked peptides were loaded onto an Easy-Spray column heated at 35 °C (C18, 3-μm particle size, 200-Å pore size, and 50 μm × 15 cm; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and eluted using a 120-min LC gradient (2–10% B, 0–6 min; 10–35% B, 6–102 min; 35–100% B, 102–113 min; followed by equilibration, where mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min. The spray voltage was 2.0 kV, and the 10 most abundant ions (with a charge stage of 4–7) were selected and fragmented by higher energy collisional dissociation (normalized higher energy collisional dissociation energy 28). The raw data were transformed to MGF (mascot generic format) and searched by pLink (32.Yang B. Wu Y.J. Zhu M. Fan S.B. Lin J. Zhang K. Li S. Chi H. Li Y.X. Chen H.F. Luo S.K. Ding Y.H. Wang L.H.

An initial MS1 search window of 5 Da was allowed to cover all isotopic peaks of the cross-linked peptides. The data were automatically filtered using a mass accuracy of MS1 ≤ 10 ppm and MS2 ≤ 20 ppm of the theoretical monoisotopic (A0) and other isotopic masses (A+1, A+2, A+3, and A+4) as specified in the software. An additional search parameter was methionine oxidation as a variable modification. A maximum of two trypsin missed cleavage sites was allowed. The initial search results were obtained using a default 5% false discovery rate, as predicted by a target decoy search strategy. In our analysis, we treated the 5% false discovery rate as a rough initial filter of the raw data. We then manually inspected all of the cross-link MS/MS spectra that were assigned by the software and applied additional filters to remove potential false positive identifications from the data set (30.Shi Y.

The present online survey aimed at supporting this incidental observation by empirical data. For this, 488 participants from various ethnic backgrounds (US, UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, and others) filled out a self-developed online-questionnaire. Results showed that overall more than 50% of the participants believed in gender differences in multitasking abilities. Of those who believed in gender differences, a majority of 80% believed that women were better at multitasking. The main reasons for this were believed to be an evolutionary advantage and more multitasking practice in women, mainly due to managing children and household and/or family and job. Findings were consistent across the different countries, thus supporting the existence of a widespread gender stereotype that women are better at multitasking than men. Further questionnaire results provided information about the participants' self-rated own multitasking abilities, and how they conceived multitasking activities such as childcare, phoning while driving, and office work."
https://openalex.org/W1947645420,"The placenta forms the interface between the maternal and fetal circulation and is critical for the establishment of a healthy pregnancy. Trophoblast cell proliferation, migration and invasion into the endometrium are fundamental events in the initiation of placentation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to promote trophoblast invasion in vitro, however its precise role in trophoblast invasion in vivo is unknown. We hypothesized that LIF would be required for normal trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodeling in mice. Both LIF and its receptor (LIFRα) co-localized with cytokeratin-positive invasive endovascular extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) in mouse implantation sites during mid-gestation. Temporally blocking LIF action during specific periods of placental development via administration of our unique LIFRα antagonist, PEGLA, resulted in abnormal trophoblast invasion and impaired spiral artery remodeling compared to PEG control. PEGLA-treated mouse decidual vessels were characterized by retention of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-positive vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), while PEG control decidual vessels were remodelled by cytokeratin-positive trophoblasts. LIF blockade did not alter F4/80-positive decidual macrophage numbers between treatment groups, but resulted in down-regulation of decidual transcript levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), which are important immune cell activation factors that promote spiral artery remodeling during pregnancy. Our data suggest that LIF plays an important role in trophoblast invasion in vivo and may facilitate trophoblast-decidual-immune cell cross talk to enable adequate spiral artery remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W1789712937,"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure increases malignant melanoma (MM) risk, but in the context of acute, not cumulative exposure. C>T and CC>TT changes make up the overwhelming majority of single base substitutions (SBS) in MM DNA, as both precursor melanocytes and melanocytic lesions have incurred incidental exposures to sunlight. To study the mutagenic mechanisms by which acute sunburn accelerates MM, we sequenced the exomes of spontaneous and neonatal UVB-induced Cdk4-R24C::Tyr-NRASQ61K mouse MMs. UVR-induced MMs carried more SBSs than spontaneous MMs, but the levels of genomic instability, reflected by translocations and copy number changes, were not different. C>T/G>A was the most common SBS in spontaneous and UVR-induced MMs, only modestly increased in the latter. However, they tended to occur at the motif A/GpCpG (reflecting C>T transition due to spontaneous deamination of cytosine at CpG) in spontaneous MMs, and T/CpCpC/T (reflecting the effects of pyrimidine dimers on either side of the mutated C) in UVR-induced MMs. Unlike MMs associated with repetitive exposures, we observed no CC>TT changes. In addition, we also found UVR ‘footprints’ at T>A/A>Ts (at NpTpT) and T>C/A>G (at CpTpC). These footprints are also present in MMs from a chronic UVR mouse model, and in some human MMs, suggesting that they may be minor UVR signature changes. We found few significantly somatically mutated genes (~6 per spontaneous and 15 per UVR-induced melanoma) in addition to the Cdk4 and NRAS mutations already present. Trp53 was the most convincing recurrently mutated gene; however, in the UVR-induced MMs no Trp53 mutations were at C>T/G>A, suggesting that it was probably mutated during tumour progression, not directly induced by UVR photoproducts. The very low load of recurrent mutations convincingly induced by classical UVB-induced dimer photoproducts may support a role for cell extrinsic mechanisms, such as photoimmunosuppression and inflammation in driving MM after acute UVB exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1958375456,"Cadherin subtype switching from E-cadherin to N-cadherin is associated with the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process required for invasion and dissemination of carcinoma cells. We found that N-cadherin is expressed in human and mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), suggesting that N-cadherin may also have a role in early-stage pancreatic cancer. To investigate the role of N-cadherin in mouse PanIN (mPanIN), we simultaneously activated oncogenic K-rasG12D and deleted the N-cadherin (Cdh2) gene in the murine pancreas. Genetic ablation of N-cadherin (N-cad KO) caused hyperproliferation, accelerated mPanIN progression, and early tumor development in K-rasG12D mice. Decreased E-cadherin and redistribution of β-catenin accompanied the loss of N-cadherin in pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDEC). Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its transcription co-activator Tcf4 led to activation of Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Unexpectedly, loss of N-cadherin in the K-rasG12D model resulted in increased mPanIN progression and tumor incidence. These in vivo results demonstrate for the first time that N-cadherin functions as a growth suppressor in the context of oncogenic K-ras."
https://openalex.org/W1929356837,"Background Body image distortion is highly prevalent among overweight individuals. Whilst there is evidence that body-dissatisfied women and those suffering from disordered eating show a negative attentional bias towards their own unattractive body parts and others’ attractive body parts, little is known about visual attention patterns in the area of obesity and with respect to males. Since eating disorders and obesity share common features in terms of distorted body image and body dissatisfaction, the aim of this study was to examine whether overweight men and women show a similar attentional bias. Methods/Design We analyzed eye movements in 30 overweight individuals (18 females) and 28 normal-weight individuals (16 females) with respect to the participants’ own pictures as well as gender- and BMI-matched control pictures (front and back view). Additionally, we assessed body image and disordered eating using validated questionnaires. Discussion The overweight sample rated their own body as less attractive and showed a more disturbed body image. Contrary to our assumptions, they focused significantly longer on attractive compared to unattractive regions of both their own and the control body. For one’s own body, this was more pronounced for women. A higher weight status and more frequent body checking predicted attentional bias towards attractive body parts. We found that overweight adults exhibit an unexpected and stable pattern of selective attention, with a distinctive focus on their own attractive body regions despite higher levels of body dissatisfaction. This positive attentional bias may either be an indicator of a more pronounced pattern of attentional avoidance or a self-enhancing strategy. Further research is warranted to clarify these results."
https://openalex.org/W1756519426,"Human adenoviruses (HAdV) are used as a model system to investigate tumorigenic processes in mammalian cells where the viral oncoproteins E1A and E1B-55K are absolutely required for oncogenic transformation, because they simultaneously accelerate cell cycle progression and inhibit tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, although the underlying mechanism is still not understood in detail. In our present study, we provide evidence that E1B-55K binding to the PML-NB component Sp100A apparently has an essential role in regulating adenovirus-mediated transformation processes. Specifically, when this E1B-55K/Sp100A complex recruits p53, Sp100A-induced activation of p53 transcriptional activity is effectively abolished. Hence, Sp100A exhibits tumor-suppressive activity, not only by stabilizing p53 transactivation but also by depressing E1A/E1B-55K-mediated transformation. E1B-55K counteracts this suppressive activity, inducing Sp100A SUMOylation and sequestering the modified cellular factor into the insoluble matrix of the nucleus or into cytoplasmic inclusions. These observations provide novel insights into how E1B-55K modulates cellular determinants to maintain growth-promoting activity during oncogenic processes and lytic infection."

However, regulations of this signaling pathway are not completely understood. Here, we report that Lzap, a tumor suppressor, controls nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In zebrafish embryos disruption of lzap increases the expression of chordin (chd), which encodes a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist that is localized in prospective dorsal cells and promotes dorsal fates. Consistently, lzap-deficient embryos with attenuated BMP signaling are dorsalized, which can be rescued by overexpression of zebrafish lzap or bmp2b or human LZAP. The expansion of chd expression in embryos lacking lzap is due to the accumulation of nuclear β-catenin in ventral cells, in which β-catenin is usually degraded. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3, a master regulator of β-catenin degradation, is suppressed in lzap-deficient embryos via inhibitory phosphorylation. Finally, we also report that a similar regulatory axis is also likely to be present in a human tongue carcinoma cell line, SAS.

Buprenorphine plays a particular role in opiate dependence care provision in France. It is widely prescribed by physicians and national opiate substitution treatment guidelines have been available since 2004. In order to study the prescribing of buprenorphine, we used a questionnaire sent by email, to a large sample of physicians. These physicians were either in practice, or belonged to an addiction treatment network or a hospital. The main objective of this work was to measure the extent to which the theoretical, clinical attitude of physicians towards prescribing buprenorphine (BHD) complied with the statutory guidelines. We showed that the physicians we interviewed rarely took into account the guidelines regarding buprenorphine prescription. The actual prescribing of Buprenorphine differed from the guidelines. Only 42% of independent Family Physicians (FPs), working outside the national health care system, had prescribed buprenorphine as a first-time prescription and 40% of FPs do not follow up patients on buprenorphine. In terms of compliance with the guidelines, 55% of FPs gave theoretical answers that only partially complied with the guidelines. The variations in compliance with the guidelines was noted according to different variables and took into particular account whether the physician were affiliated to a network or in training."

Most of the amino acid residues that surround the aspartate substrate in the binding pocket of GltPh are highly conserved. However, in the brain transporters, Thr-352 and Met-362 of the reentrant hairpin loop 2 are replaced by the smaller Ala and Thr, respectively. Therefore, we have studied the effects of T352A and M362T on binding and transport of aspartate and glutamate by GltPh. Substrate-dependent intrinsic fluorescence changes were monitored in transporter constructs containing the L130W mutation. GltPh-L130W/T352A exhibited an ∼15-fold higher apparent affinity for l-glutamate than the wild type transporter, and the M362T mutation resulted in an increased affinity of ∼40-fold. An even larger increase of the apparent affinity for l-glutamate, around 130-fold higher than that of wild type, was observed with the T352A/M362T double mutant. Radioactive uptake experiments show that GltPh-T352A not only transports aspartate but also l-glutamate. Remarkably, GltPh-M362T exhibited l-aspartate but not l-glutamate transport. The double mutant retained the ability to transport l-glutamate, but its kinetic parameters were very similar to those of GltPh-T352A alone. The differential impact of mutation on binding and transport of glutamate suggests that hairpin loop 2 not only plays a role in the selection of the substrate but also in its translocation. Crystal structures of the archaeal homologue GltPh have provided important insights into the molecular mechanism of transport of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Whereas mammalian glutamate transporters can translocate both glutamate and aspartate, GltPh is only one capable of aspartate transport. Most of the amino acid residues that surround the aspartate substrate in the binding pocket of GltPh are highly conserved. However, in the brain transporters, Thr-352 and Met-362 of the reentrant hairpin loop 2 are replaced by the smaller Ala and Thr, respectively. Therefore, we have studied the effects of T352A and M362T on binding and transport of aspartate and glutamate by GltPh.

The differential impact of mutation on binding and transport of glutamate suggests that hairpin loop 2 not only plays a role in the selection of the substrate but also in its translocation.

These and other observations indicate that the structures of the homologues represent excellent models for the brain transporters. Two recent fluorescence studies, employing the substrate-dependent increase of the fluorescence of a tryptophan residue introduced at position 130 of GltPh (L130W) (14.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D.

GltPh selects between different substrates by these two consecutive processes. l-Aspartate as the preferred substrate exhibits the highest association rates and HP2 closure rate (22.Ewers D.

Although archaeal transporters represent excellent models for multiple aspects of brain transporter function, there is an important difference between the eukaryotic and archaeal transporters. Specifically, GltPh and GltTk do not recognize l-glutamate and therefore actually function as aspartate transporters (14.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Because HP2 appears to be a molecular determinant of the induced fit (22.Ewers D. Becher T. Machtens J.P. Weyand I. Fahlke C. Induced fit substrate binding to an archaeal glutamate transporter homologue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 12486-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), this reentrant loop likely contains residues that are involved in substrate specificity. We have therefore studied the transport properties of selected GltPh-HP2 mutants to better understand how GltPh selects against l-Glu and for l-Asp. Wild type (WT)-GltPh containing a C-terminal His8 tag and cloned into the pBAD24 vector was a gift of Eric Gouaux. The cDNA of the coding region of GltPh-WT was cloned into pBluescript KS− using BamHI and EcoRI. Single-stranded uracil-containing DNA was prepared from this construct, and mutations were introduced as described previously (31.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

The mutations were verified by sequencing and transferred back into the original construct in the pBAD24 vector using unique restriction enzymes. Heterologous expression of the mutants and the WT was induced in Escherichia coli Top10 cells by the addition of 1% l-arabinose when an A600 of 0.6–0.7 was reached. The purification of the GltPh-WT and mutants was done as described (22.Ewers D. Becher T. Machtens J.P. Weyand I. Fahlke C.

In some cases, the histidine tag was removed with thrombin to verify that the results of the transport experiments were not influenced by the tag. This was performed as described using Sephadex G-50 spin columns (1.Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjørås M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I.

Briefly, 20 μl of purified transporter solution, containing 0.1% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside, was mixed with liposomes (4 μmol of asolectin and 0.7 μmol of brain phospholipids) resuspended in the desired “in” medium (see below), 400 mm NaCl, and 1% cholate in a final volume of 200 μl. After a 10-min incubation on ice, the mixture was centrifuged through the spin columns, which were equilibrated with KPi or Tris-Pi, pH 7.4 (the in medium), as indicated in the figure legends. Uptake under standard transport conditions was measured as described (1.Pines G. Danbolt N.C. Bjørås M. Zhang Y. Bendahan A. Eide L. Koepsell H. Storm-Mathisen J. Seeberg E. Kanner B.I.

This corresponds to final concentrations of 215 and 58 nm, respectively. These sub-saturating conditions (see Table 2) were chosen to achieve maximal sensitivity without the need to use large amounts of radioactivity. Only in the case of Fig. 7 and in the determination of the kinetic parameters of transport (Table 2) was unlabeled substrate added together with increased amounts of radiolabeled substrate. Differences in ionic compositions of the “out” and “in” media from the above standard transport conditions are indicated in the figure legends. The protein concentration of the proteoliposomes was determined by re-extraction of 20-μl samples with 300 μl of a solution containing 2% SDS, 6 m urea, and 15 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, for 20 min followed by purification using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The samples (50% of the volume of the eluate) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After staining/destaining, the intensity of the transporter bands was compared with those of a BSA standard curve using a scanner and ImageJ software.TABLE 2Kinetic constants of l-glutamate and l-aspartate transportKmVmaxμmpmol/min/μg proteinGltphl-Asp0.17 ± 0.0229.7 ± 4.4T352Al-Asp0.18 ± 0.0139.1 ± 4.6l-Glu0.92 ± 0.167.5 ± 0.3M362Tl-Asp0.03 ± 0.0126.0 ± 6.0T352A/M362Tl-Asp0.06 ± 0.0135.8 ± 1.9l-Glu1.33 ± 0.395.8 ± 0.9 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence of the L130W parent and mutant transporters in detergent micelles was measured in a QuantaMaster 4 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology, Inc.). Prior to measurements, to remove potentially bound amino acids, the purified protein was subjected to four successive purification steps using disposable desalting columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 200 mm choline chloride, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside, followed by one additional step with measuring buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.05% n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside). Trp-130 fluorescence titrations of the transporters with amino acids were done under constant stirring at temperatures of 22–25 °C in a 1-cm cuvette. The protein was diluted to 50–250 nm in measuring buffer, and responses to l-aspartate or l-glutamate were registered after adding aliquots of concentrated stock solutions. Fluorescence emission at 320 nm upon excitation at 295 nm was determined with the excitation and emission slits set to a bandpass of 4 nm. The measured photomultiplier photon counts were corrected for the excitation intensity. To obtain the Trp-130 fluorescence intensities, the signal of the measuring buffer alone was subtracted. The fluorescence intensity data were corrected for the error resulting from a decreased concentration of the fluorophore on the addition of any solution volume. To determine binding affinities, the Hill Equation 1, Fraction of bound protein = [ L ] n H [ L ] n H + K D n H (Eq. 1) where L is any ligand and nH is the Hill coefficient, was fitted to the resulting amino acid concentration dependences of the fluorescence intensity. In cases where the GltPh concentration was higher than the expected KD, the quadratic Morrison Equation 2 (33.Morrison J.F.

Such residues are expected to have a smaller side chain in the EAATs than their GltPh counterpart to accommodate the larger glutamate in the substrate binding pocket. Two residues fulfill these criteria, namely Thr-352 (GltPh numbering) which is Ala in the eukaryotic transporters, and Met-362, which is slightly larger than the Thr occupying this position in the eukaryotic transporters (Fig. 1C). In the outward-facing Asp-bound structure of GltPh (Protein Data Bank code 2NWX), the methyl group of Thr-352 (GltPh numbering) is only ∼3.6 and ∼4.3 Å away from an oxygen atom of the β-carboxyl group and the β-carbon of the bound aspartate substrate, respectively and could clash with bound glutamate. We also considered Met-362 (Fig. 1), because in an alternative side-chain conformation, such as that seen in the inhibitor-bound conformation of GltPh (14.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), this residue could potentially be very close to the bound substrate. Therefore, we studied the effects of the T352A and M362T mutations on binding and transport of aspartate and glutamate by GltPh. Coupled binding of aspartate and Na+ to GltPh can be monitored in GltPh-L130W; this tryptophan is introduced at the junction between TM4 and the loop connecting TM3 and -4. This mutation enables the measurement of substrate-dependent changes of fluorescence signals by GltPh (14.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The L130W mutation does not affect functionality; the rate of l-aspartate transport by the reconstituted L130W proteoliposomes under standard transport conditions actually exhibited an even higher uptake rate than GltPh-WT, namely 60.3 ± 15.2 versus 34.9 ± 5.2 pmol/μg of protein/3 min (n = 3). We introduced the T352A and M362T mutations singly and together in the L130W background. GltPh-L130W and the three mutant transporters were expressed and purified. The concentration dependence of l-glutamate-induced fluorescence increase was monitored with the purified proteins in detergent micelles (Fig. 2). We chose a high sodium concentration (200 mm) to approach saturation of the sodium-binding sites that are occupied before amino acid binding (22.Ewers D. Becher T. Machtens J.P. Weyand I. Fahlke C. Induced fit substrate binding to an archaeal glutamate transporter homologue.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 12486-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fitting the Hill equation to the dose-response curves yielded a KD of 12.6 ± 0.7 μm (n = 4) for l-glutamate binding to GltPh-T352A/L130W. This is almost 20-fold lower than that of the L130W parent construct (Fig. 2 and Table 1). M362T/L130W showed a 50-fold decreased KD for l-glutamate, and for T352A/M362T/L130W the KD was decreased about 160-fold (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The observed changes in l-glutamate binding suggest that the mutated amino acids are involved in substrate selectivity.TABLE 1Binding constants of l-glutamate and l-aspartatel-Aspl-GlunmμmGltph4.9 ± 2.1237 ± 55T352A5.2 ± 2.512.6 ± 0.7M362T0.3 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.3T352A/M362T1.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab The above results could also be explained by a non-selective increase in acidic amino acid binding or an indirect change of apparent affinities through a change in sodium binding. To assess this, we measured l-aspartate binding to the side-chain GltPh variants (Fig. 3). At the sodium concentration used here, the KD value for l-aspartate is comparable or below the nanomolar protein concentrations that are necessary for the measurement of tryptophan fluorescence (14.Boudker O.

Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the resulting titration curves do not show half-saturation at l-aspartate concentrations equal to KD as predicted by the Hill equation. Therefore, we fitted the data to a quadratic binding equation that takes the protein concentration into account (see also “Experimental Procedures”). Table 1 shows that the KD value of T352A/L130W for l-aspartate does not differ significantly from that of GltPh-L130W, which is roughly 50,000-fold lower than for l-glutamate (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Thus, the increase of apparent substrate affinity to GltPh-T352A/L130W is an effect that is specific to l-glutamate, although l-aspartate still binds better than l-glutamate. In contrast, the M362T mutant displayed a 16-fold decreased KD value for l-aspartate relative to L130W GltPh (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Thus, the ∼40-fold decreased l-glutamate KD value of M362T/L130W"
https://openalex.org/W1857478112,"Joint analysis of multiple phenotypes has gained growing attention in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), especially for the analysis of multiple intermediate phenotypes which measure the same underlying complex human disorder. One of the multivariate methods, MultiPhen (O' Reilly et al. 2012), employs the proportional odds model to regress a genotype on multiple phenotypes, hence ignoring the phenotypic distributions. Despite the flexibilities of MultiPhen, the properties and performance of MultiPhen are not well understood, especially when the phenotypic distributions are non-normal. In fact, it is well known in the statistical literature that the estimation is attenuated when the explanatory variables contain measurement errors. In this study, we first established an equivalence relationship between MultiPhen and the generalized Kendall tau association test, shedding light on why MultiPhen can perform well for joint association analysis of multiple phenotypes. Through the equivalence, we show that MultiPhen may lose power when the phenotypes are non-normal. To maintain the power, we propose two solutions (ATeMP-rn and ATeMP-or) to improve MultiPhen, and demonstrate their effectiveness through extensive simulation studies and a real case study from the Guangzhou Twin Eye Study."
https://openalex.org/W1894650070,"Regardless of whether a leaf is simple or compound, the mechanism underlying its development will give rise to a full comprehension of plant morphogenesis. The role of Argonaute1 (AGO1) in the development of simple leaves has been established, but its role in the development of compound leaves remains to be characterized. In this paper, a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) strategy was used to dramatically down-regulate the expression of AGO1 ortholog in tomatoes, a model plant for research into compound leaves. AGO1-silenced tomato compound leaves exhibited morphological defects of leaf adaxial-abaxial and trichome development. Analysis of global gene expression profiles indicated that the silencing of AGO1 in tomato compound leaf caused significant changes in the expression of several critical genes, including Auxin Response Factor 4 (ARF4) and Non-expressor of PR5 (NPR5), which were involved in adaxial-abaxial formation and IAA15 that was found to contribute to growth of trichomes as well as Gibberellic Acid Insensitive (GAI) which participated in hormone regulation. Collectively, these results shed light on the complicated mechanism by which AGO1 regulates compound leaf development."
https://openalex.org/W1899671556,"Whereas the entrainment of movements and aspirations among audience members has been known as a basis of collective excitement in the theater, the role of the entrainment of cognitive processes among audience members is still unclear. In the current study, temporal patterns of the audience’s attention were observed using eyeblink responses. To determine the effect of interactions among audience members on cognitive entrainment, as well as its direction (attractive or repulsive), the eyeblink synchronization of the following two groups were compared: (1) the experimental condition, where the audience members (seven frequent viewers and seven first-time viewers) viewed live performances in situ, and (2) the control condition, where the audience members (15 frequent viewers and 15 first-time viewers) viewed videotaped performances in individual experimental settings (results reported in previous study.) The results of this study demonstrated that the mean values of a measure of asynchrony (i.e., D interval) were much lower for the experimental condition than for the control condition. Frequent viewers had a moderate attractive effect that increased as the story progressed, while a strong attractive effect was observed throughout the story for first-time viewers. The attractive effect of interactions among a group of spectators was discussed from the viewpoint of cognitive and somatic entrainment in live performances."

The lipin family is a magnesium-dependent type I PA phosphatase involved in de novo synthesis of neutral lipids and phospholipids. The regulation of lipin activity may govern the pathways by which these lipids are synthesized and control the cellular levels of important signaling lipids. Moreover, the proto-oncoprotein c-Fos has an emerging role in glycerolipid synthesis regulation; by interacting with key synthesizing enzymes it is able to increase overall phospho- and glycolipid synthesis. We studied the lipin 1β enzyme activity in a cell-free system using PA/Triton X-100 mixed micelles as substrate, analyzing it in the presence/absence of c-Fos. We found that lipin 1β kcat value increases around 40% in the presence of c-Fos, with no change in the lipin 1β affinity for the PA/Triton X-100 mixed micelles. We also probed a physical interaction between both proteins. Although the c-Fos domain involved in lipin activation is its basic domain, the interaction domain is mapped to the N-terminal c-Fos. In conclusion, we provide evidence for a novel positive regulator of lipin 1β PA phosphatase activity that is not achieved via altering its subcellular localization or affinity for membranes but rather through directly increasing its catalytic efficiency.

It sits at a unique branching point; it can be transformed by a PA phosphatase to diacylglycerol (DAG), a common precursor of the Kennedy pathway, or alternatively, it can be diverted to the pathway of synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and its phosphorylated derivatives by the rate-limiting enzyme CDP-diacylglycerol synthase (2Athenstaedt K. Daum G. Phosphatidic acid, a key intermediate in lipid metabolism.Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In comparison with its precursors and metabolites, steady state PA levels are low in growing cells despite the considerable metabolic flux through the cellular PA pool required to sustain phospholipid synthesis. In addition to their biosynthetic roles, PA and DAG are also important for signal transduction cascades (3Stace C.L. Ktistakis N.T. Phosphatidic acid- and phosphatidylserine-binding proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). PA is implicated in transcription regulation, activation of cell growth, membrane proliferation, secretion, and vesicular trafficking, whereas DAG is primarily involved in the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and a few non-PKC targets such as protein kinase D or DAG kinases β and γ (4Carrasco S.

Lipins are magnesium-dependent PA phosphatases, previously characterized biochemically as type I PA phosphatases (PAP I), that are involved in the de novo synthesis of neutral lipids and phospholipids (7Harris T.E. Finck B.N. Dual function lipin proteins and glycerolipid metabolism.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2011; 22: 226-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Unlike other enzymes of the Kennedy pathway, lipins are not integral membrane proteins and need to translocate from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to participate in glycerolipid synthesis (8Csaki L.S. Reue K. Lipins: multifunctional lipid metabolism proteins.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2010; 30: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The lipin 1 polybasic domain (PBD), a stretch of nine consecutive basic amino acids, is involved in selective PA binding to promote its translocation to membranes. This translocation depends on its phosphorylation status; mammalian target of rapamycin-mediated phosphorylation inhibits di-anionic PA recognition by the PBD, the major driving force in membrane association (9Eaton J.M. Mullins G.R. Brindley D.N. Harris T.E. Phosphorylation of lipin 1 and charge on the phosphatidic acid head group control its phosphatidic acid phosphatase activity and membrane association.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 9933-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The lipin 1 PBD is also its primary nuclear localization signal. It has been proposed that the dual role for PBM is regulated through PA levels; elevated PA content on cytoplasmic membranes antagonizes nuclear localization of lipin 1 (10Ren H. Federico L. Huang H. Sunkara M. Drennan T. Frohman M.A. Smyth S.S. Morris A.J. A phosphatidic acid binding/nuclear localization motif determines lipin1 function in lipid metabolism and adipogenesis.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3171-3181Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the lipins in the nucleus play a role in directly regulating transcription of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (11Siniossoglou S. Phospholipid metabolism and nuclear function: roles of the lipin family of phosphatidic acid phosphatases.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1831: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For example, lipin 1β was shown to interact directly with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, a key transcription factor of lipid metabolism in the liver, and its co-activator PGC-1α (12Finck B.N. Gropler M.C. Chen Z. Leone T.C. Croce M.A. Harris T.E. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Kelly D.P. Lipin 1 is an inducible amplifier of the hepatic PGC-1α/PPARα regulatory pathway.Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 199-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In summary, lipin 1 is capable of regulating cellular lipid status at multiple levels. By regulating the fate of PA through its PAP activity, it can directly regulate phospholipid synthesis, although it can do it indirectly by modulating the activity of transcription factors important for lipid biosynthesis and breakdown. Another protein that also has both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions is c-Fos, a well known member of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors. In addition to the latter, c-Fos has another proven activity; it activates the overall metabolic labeling of both phospholipids and glycolipids at the ER in different cellular models of proliferation or differentiation. In differentiating PC12 cells, blocking c-Fos expression impairs both neuritogenesis and the activation of phospholipid and glycolipid synthesis. TLC analysis of total radioactivity in lipid extracts after metabolic labeling of these cells with [14C]Gal showed a 50–60% increase in the labeling of all 14C-labeled lipids, including glycolipids and phosphatidylcholine (13Crespo P.M. Silvestre D.C. Gil G.A. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Caputto B.L. c-Fos activates glucosylceramide synthase and glycolipid synthesis in PC12 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At the same time, similar experiments carried out with [32P]orthophosphate acid show a similar increase on all 32P-labeled phospholipids (14Gil G.A. Bussolino D.F. Portal M.M. Alfonso Pecchio A. Renner M.L. Borioli G.A. Guido M.E. Caputto B.L. c-Fos activated phospholipid synthesis is required for neurite elongation in differentiating PC12 cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1881-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results corroborate a global stimulation of the lipid-synthesizing machinery in the c-Fos-mediated response to a differentiation stimulus of these cells. For a review of processes in which c-Fos has been proven to participate, the reader is referred to Ref. 15Caputto B.L. Cardozo Gizzi A.M. Gil G.A. c-Fos: an AP-1 transcription factor with an additional cytoplasmic, non-genomic lipid synthesis activation capacity.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1841: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. In a very recent report, global transcription changes induced by c-Fos in an AP-1 independent way were described. It was found that this was the consequence of the c-Fos-dependent nuclear synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, a lipid involved in chromatin remodeling (16Ferrero G.O. Renner M.L. Gil G.A. Rodríguez-Berdini L. Caputto B.L. c-Fos-activated synthesis of nuclear phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] promotes global transcriptional changes.Biochem. J. 2014; 461: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this way, c-Fos integrates both functions (i) as a lipid synthesis activator and (ii) as a transcriptional modulator. Previous studies from our laboratory have found higher PAP I and lysophosphatidate acyltransferase activities in retinal ganglion cells from chicken exposed to light with respect to those maintained in the dark (17de Arriba Zerpa G.A. Guido M.E. Bussolino D.F. Pasquare S.J. Castagnet P.I. Giusto N.M. Caputto B.L. Light exposure activates retina ganglion cell lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase and phosphatidic acid phosphatase by a c-fos-dependent mechanism.J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no differences were observed in preparations obtained from light-exposed animals treated with a c-fos antisense oligonucleotide. Furthermore, no light-dark differences were found in phosphatidylserine synthase activity. Altogether, these results suggest a c-Fos-dependent glycerolipid synthesis activation that is step-specific. Later studies showed that c-Fos also increases the radiolabeling of the polyphosphoinositide (PIP) pathways in NIH 3T3 cells by increasing the enzymatic activities of CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 1 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KII) α but not the phosphatidylinositol synthase activity (18Alfonso Pecchio A.R. Cardozo Gizzi A.M. Renner M.L. Molina-Calavita M. Caputto B.L. c-Fos activates and physically interacts with specific enzymes of the pathway of synthesis of polyphosphoinositides.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 4716-4725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It can be concluded that to attain high rates of membrane biogenesis, c-Fos activates key steps of phospholipid synthesis that result in an overall activated phospholipid synthesis state. Given the importance of PA in glycerolipid metabolism, the established role of lipin 1, and the emerging functions of c-Fos, it was deemed of interest to study the relationship between lipin 1 and c-Fos. Understanding lipin 1 modulators is central for elucidating the mechanisms that coordinately activate glycerolipid synthesis during proliferation, growth, or differentiation. We found in this study that lipin 1β is activated by c-Fos through its basic domain (BD) and that this activation does not rely on changes on lipin 1β membrane affinity but rather implies changes on its catalytic efficiency. We also demonstrated that lipin 1β associates with the N-terminal region of c-Fos. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. l-α-Dipalmitoyl-[glycerol-14C]PA (specific activity 100–200 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [2-3H]Glycerol (specific activity 200 mCi/mmol) and Omnifluor were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cycloheximide, Triton X-100, and ammonium molybdate were from Sigma. DMEM, FBS, calf serum, and Lipofectamine 2000 were from Invitrogen. Nickel-Sepharose high performance was from GE Healthcare. Bradford reagents were from Bio-Rad. l-α-PA (from chicken egg) and other lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids. FluorSave was from Calbiochem. NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM and 10% calf serum. For establishing quiescence, cells were arrested in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. Quiescent cells were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by replacing the medium with 20% FBS supplemented DMEM for 1 h. Then cells were washed twice with chilled PBS, harvested, and homogenized by sonication in Milli-Q water, and finally protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. His6-tagged c-Fos and c-Fos deletion mutant plasmids were as described previously (18Alfonso Pecchio A.R. Cardozo Gizzi A.M. Renner M.L. Molina-Calavita M.

Lipin 1β-GFP-N1 and pGH327 containing GFP-tagged and His6-tagged lipin 1β were the generous gift from Dr. G. Carman. Full-length calreticulin fused to GFP was the generous gift from Dr. M. Hallak. The plasmids pmTurquoise2-N1, pSYFP2, and pSYFP2-mTurquoise2, with monomeric improved versions of cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (19Goedhart J. von Stetten D. Noirclerc-Savoye M. Lelimousin M.

Commun. 2012; 3: 751Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), were generous gifts from Drs. J. Goedhart and T. W. Gadella. We subcloned lipin 1β into pSYFP2-N1 by cutting between NheI and XhoI sites. Truncated mutants of c-Fos were obtained by PCR using the full-length c-Fos as template and inserted into pmTurquoise2-N1 vector to generate Turquoise2 fusion proteins. Recombinant human lipin 1β was expressed in Rosetta 2(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (20Han G.S. Carman G.M.

Additionally, recombinant c-Fos and c-Fos mutants were synthesized in BL21 strain of E. coli and purified as described previously (21Borioli G.A. Caputto B.L. Maggio B. c-Fos is surface active and interacts differentially with phospholipid monolayers.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, crude extracts were passed through a nickel-Sepharose affinity column; after washing thoroughly, proteins were obtained in the corresponding elution buffer. The protein concentrations of the purified proteins were determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The enzyme preparations, which had a final protein concentration of about 0.5 mg/ml, were stored in small aliquots at −80 °C, whereas c-Fos preparations, which were in 6 m urea, were stored at 4 °C for up to 1 month. Radioactive PA was obtained from [2-3H]glycerol-PC synthesized from bovine retinas incubated with [2-3H]glycerol as described previously (22Pasquaré de García S.J. Giusto N.M. Phosphatidate phosphatase activity in isolated rod outer segment from bovine retina.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 875: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from the tissue as described elsewhere (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. A simple method for the isolation and purification of total lipids from animal tissues.J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [2-3H]Glycerol-PC was isolated by mono-dimensional TLC, eluted (24Arvidson G.A. Structural and metabolic heterogeneity of rat liver glycerophosphatides.Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), and hydrolyzed with phospholipase D (25Sastry P.S. Kates M. Biosynthesis of lipids in plants. II. Incorporation of glycerophosphate-32-P into phosphatides by cell-free preparations from spinach leaves.Can. J. Biochem. 1966; 44: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis product [2-3H]glycerol PA was then purified by one-dimensional TLC on Silica Gel H developed with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/acetone/water (9:3:3:12:1.5, v/v). Radioactivity and phosphorus content (26Rouser G. Fkeischer S. Yamamoto A. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatographic separation of polar lipids and determination of phospholipids by phosphorus analysis of spots.Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar) were measured to determine specific radioactivity. [2-3H]PA with a specific radioactivity of 0.1 μCi/μmol was obtained. A color reagent to detect inorganic free phosphate composed of 3 volumes of 0.1 mm malachite green and 1 volume of 34 mm ammonium molybdate in 5 m HCl was prepared as described by Mahuren et al. (27Mahuren J.D. Coburn S.P. Slominski A. Wortsman J.

Characterization of the human LPIN1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14628-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PA in chloroform/methanol (2:1) was transferred to a glass test tube, dried under a nitrogen flow, and finally kept in vacuo for 1 h. Triton X-100 was added to PA just after buffer to prepare Triton X-100/PA-mixed micelles. Extensive vortex of the tube ensures micelle formation. The mol % of PA in a Triton X-100/PA-mixed micelle was calculated using the following formula: mol % PA = 100 × [PA (molar)]/([PA (molar)] + [Triton X-100(molar)]). In a similar way, mol % of recombinant c-Fos on the micelles was calculated as mol % c-Fos = 100 × [c-Fos (molar)]/([PA (molar)] + [Triton X-100(molar)]). PA phosphatase activity in total cellular homogenates was determined as described previously (28Pasquaré S.J. Salvador G.A. Giusto N.M.

PAP activities were differentiated on the basis of N-ethylmaleimide sensitivity (30Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Muñoz A. Brindley D.N.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this, parallel incubations were carried out after preincubating the homogenate with or without 4.2 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min. The difference between these two activities was PAP I activity. The assays were conducted at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by adding chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The reaction product was separated by TLC as described elsewhere (17de Arriba Zerpa G.A. Guido M.E.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1228-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); bands where scraped and measured using liquid scintillation counting. PA phosphatase activity in PA/Triton X-100 mixed micelles was measured as described previously (20Han G.S. Carman G.M. Characterization of the human LPIN1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase isoforms.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14628-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, unless otherwise specified, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PA, 10 mm Triton X-100, and 50 ng of enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 0.1 m HCl in methanol, 1 ml of chloroform, and 1 ml of water. After phase separation, 1 volume of the upper phase was mixed with 2 volumes of malachite green-molybdate reagent, and absorbance at 650 nm was measured. All assays contained 20 mm urea from the addition of recombinant proteins; this urea content did not alter enzyme activity (data not shown). Enzyme assays were conducted in triplicate. All enzyme reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzymatic activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the SigmaPlot enzyme kinetics module. Student's t test (SigmaPlot software) was used to determine statistical significance, and p values of <0.05 were taken as a significant difference. The assays were performed as described in Bonifacino and Dell'Angelica (31Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Springer T.A. Immunoprecipitation.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2001; (Chapter 9, Unit 9.8)Google Scholar) with nondenaturing detergent solution. Briefly, quiescent cells were stimulated with 20% FBS for 1 h, harvested, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl) with complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were preabsorbed with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 4,200 rpm. Protein complexes in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated using 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads coupled to 1 μg of rabbit anti-c-Fos antibody (sc-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight in an orbital shaker. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, and Protease Inhibitor Mixture) and once with 10 mm PBS and analyzed by Western blot. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions on 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (14Gil G.A.

Blocked membranes were incubated with the specified primary antibody, washed twice with PBS/Tween 0.1%, and incubated using the appropriate secondary antibodies (LI-COR) (1:25,000). Immunoreactive bands were detected by Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR). Quiescent cells were stimulated with 20% FBS for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS solution during 10 min at room temperature and washed with PBS. Saturation was achieved by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The slides were incubated with the corresponding primary antibody in blocking solution as follows: rabbit anti-c-Fos (dilution 1:50, sc-52, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-lipin-1 (dilution 1:50, sc-50049, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C in humid chamber. Then the slides were washed with PBS and incubated with the corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (Alexa Fluor 488, 546, or 633, Molecular Probes). After washing with PBS, slides were mounted using FluorSave. To determine proper binding and whether the applied antisera interacts, we performed incubations with only one of the primary antibodies (same dilution as in the double label experiments), followed by incubation with the mixture of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antisera. Confocal images were collected using an Olympus FV-1000 confocal microscope using laser lines from argon laser (488 nm) and two helium neon lasers (543 and 633 nm). We performed the acquisition sequentially for each channel using a clip rectangle to image only a region of interest comprising a single cell. The pixel size was 135 nm/pixel using a confocal pinhole of 110 μm. Instead of using a post-acquisition algorithm, images were taken in the Kalman filtering mode (line × 10) to average out detector shot noise. The procedure was as described previously (18Alfonso Pecchio A.R. Cardozo Gizzi A.M. Renner M.L. Molina-Calavita M. Caputto B.L. c-Fos activates and physically interacts with specific enzymes of the pathway of synthesis of polyphosphoinositides.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 4716-4725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture dishes containing a coverslip and grown to 80–90% confluence at the time of transfection. After inducing quiescence, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide was added 1 h prior to stimulating cells for another hour with 20% FBS. Then cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and rinsed with Milli-Q water. Coverslips were mounted with FluorSave and visualized using an Olympus FV1000 or FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope. A plan apochromat 60×, numerical aperture 1.42, oil immersion objective lens zoomed digitally three times, 512 × 512 image resolution was used. The mTurquoise (donor) and SYFP2 (acceptor) chimeric proteins were excited with an argon laser at 458 and 515 nm, respectively. The emission channel was 465–495 nm for the donor and 530–560 nm for the acceptor. The sensitized emission measurement was the chosen approach. We used the algorithm described by Elangovan et al. (32Elangovan M. Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Day R.N. Barroso M. Periasamy A. Characterization of one- and two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy.Methods. 2003; 29: 58-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Post-acquisition cell-by-cell image analysis and quantification were performed with ImageJ as described elsewhere. The Dex/Dem shows the quenched donor (qD) fluorescence and corresponds to the donor channel (D), whereas the Aex/Aem indicates the acceptor fluorescence and corresponds to the acceptor channel (A). The Dex/Aem corresponds to the uncorrected FRET (uFRET) image, which is then processed by the Elangovan algorithm to generate the precision-FRET (PFRET) image, showing the corrected energy transfer levels in Equation 1, PFRET = uFRET − qD ⋅ CT D − A ⋅ BT A (Eq. 1) where the coefficients for donor cross-talk (CTD) and acceptor bleed through (BTA) were calculated from single transfected donor or acceptor, respectively. The energy transfer efficiency, shown in Equation 2, E = 1 − ( qD uD ) (Eq. 2) is expressed as a percentage of the fluorescence of donor in the absence of FRET or unquenched donor uD. This last parameter was calculated as shown in Equation 3 uD = qD + PFRET (Eq. 3) as an approximation of Equation B.19 in Ref. 32Elangovan M. Wallrabe H. Chen Y. Day R.N. Barroso M. Periasamy A.

After background subtraction, a mask was applied independently to qD,"
https://openalex.org/W1792947220,"Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), which have been identified in most animals, are pattern recognition molecules that involve antimicrobial defense. Resulting from extraordinary expansion of innate immune genes, the amphioxus encodes many PGRPs of diverse functions. For instance, three isoforms of PGRP encoded by Branchiostoma belcheri tsingtauense, termed BbtPGRP1~3, are fused with a chitin binding domain (CBD) at the N-terminus. Here we report the 2.7 Å crystal structure of BbtPGRP3, revealing an overall structure of an N-terminal hevein-like CBD followed by a catalytic PGRP domain. Activity assays combined with site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the individual PGRP domain exhibits amidase activity towards both DAP-type and Lys-type peptidoglycans (PGNs), the former of which is favored. The N-terminal CBD not only has the chitin-binding activity, but also enables BbtPGRP3 to gain a five-fold increase of amidase activity towards the Lys-type PGNs, leading to a significantly broadened substrate spectrum. Together, we propose that modular evolution via domain shuffling combined with gene horizontal transfer makes BbtPGRP1~3 novel PGRPs of augmented catalytic activity and broad recognition spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W1771384396,"Recent publications have emphasized the importance of a multidisciplinary strategy for maximum conservation and utilization of lung biopsy material for advanced testing, which may determine therapy. This paper quantifies the effect of a multidisciplinary strategy implemented to optimize and increase tissue volume in CT-guided transthoracic needle core lung biopsies. The strategy was three-pronged: (1) once there was confidence diagnostic tissue had been obtained and if safe for the patient, additional biopsy passes were performed to further increase volume of biopsy material, (2) biopsy material was placed in multiple cassettes for processing, and (3) all tissue ribbons were conserved when cutting blocks in the histology laboratory. This study quantifies the effects of strategies #1 and #2.This retrospective analysis comparing CT-guided lung biopsies from 2007 and 2012 (before and after multidisciplinary approach implementation) was performed at a single institution. Patient medical records were reviewed and main variables analyzed include biopsy sample size, radiologist, number of blocks submitted, diagnosis, and complications. The biopsy sample size measured was considered to be directly proportional to tissue volume in the block.Biopsy sample size increased 2.5 fold with the average total biopsy sample size increasing from 1.0 cm (0.9-1.1 cm) in 2007 to 2.5 cm (2.3-2.8 cm) in 2012 (P<0.0001). The improvement was statistically significant for each individual radiologist. During the same time, the rate of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement decreased from 15% to 7% (P = 0.065). No other major complications were identified. The proportion of tumor within the biopsy material was similar at 28% (23%-33%) and 35% (30%-40%) for 2007 and 2012, respectively. The number of cases with at least two blocks available for testing increased from 10.7% to 96.4% (P<0.0001).The effect of this multidisciplinary strategy to CT-guided lung biopsies was effective in significantly increasing tissue volume and number of blocks available for advanced diagnostic testing."

Moosbrugger. Y. Shi, Encoding structural information uniquely with polynomial-based descriptors by employing the Randić matrix, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 268(2015), 164-168]. We demonstrate that by using the new functional matrix approach, exhaustively generated graphs can be discriminated more uniquely than shown in the mentioned previous work."
