Determining the steps of bnAb induction in HIV-1-infected individuals who make bnAbs is a key strategy for immunogen design. Here, we study the B cell response in a bnAb-producing individual and report cooperation between two B cell lineages to drive bnAb development. We isolated a virus-neutralizing antibody lineage that targeted an envelope region (loop D) and selected virus escape mutants that resulted in both enhanced bnAb lineage envelope binding and escape mutant neutralization—traits associated with increased B cell antigen drive. Thus, in this individual, two B cell lineages cooperated to induce the development of bnAbs. Design of vaccine immunogens that simultaneously drive both helper and broadly neutralizing B cell lineages may be important for vaccine-induced recapitulation of events that transpire during the maturation of neutralizing antibodies in HIV-1-infected individuals.

The development of a successful HIV-1 vaccine has been stymied by the inability to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to regions of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) (Burton et al., 2012Burton D.R.

One approach to dissect the mechanisms underlying bnAb development is to identify the drivers that are responsible for the sequential stimulation of HIV-1 reactive B cell lineages in chronically infected individuals over time (Bonsignori et al., 2011Bonsignori M.

We have recently identified an African individual (CH505) in whom HIV-1 infection was established by a single subtype C transmitted/founder (T/F) virus and mapped the coevolution of CD4bs bnAbs (the CH103 bnAb B cell lineage) and CH505 T/F virus over time (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The T/F Env continuously diversified over time under the selection pressure of bnAbs and, concurrently, the inferred unmutated common ancestor (UCA) of the CH103 B cell lineage accumulated somatic mutations leading to gradual acquisition of bnAb activity (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). While the minimally mutated early members of this lineage neutralized only the T/F virus, the later, more mature members of the CH103 clonal lineage potently neutralized both the CH505 T/F and 55% of multiclade heterologous HIV-1 strains (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These data engendered interest in determining the autologous virus Env variants that stimulated the development of this broadly neutralizing CH103 antibody lineage. Cocrystal structure of the CH103 antibody and the HIV-1 Env revealed antibody contacts in the V5, CD4-binding loop, and loop D regions in Env, and analysis of the env gene sequences obtained by single-genome amplification demonstrated additional early mutations in the V1 and V4 loop regions (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). In this study, we have probed the mechanisms of selection of early CH505 Env mutations and found that amino acid changes in the V1, V4, V5, and CD4-binding loops resulted in escape from neutralization by the CH103 lineage (V1, V5, CD4-binding loop) or from cytotoxic T cell pressure (V4). Surprisingly, however, the mutations in the Env loop D increased neutralization sensitivity to the CH103 bnAb lineage. We demonstrated a mechanism of bnAb induction wherein a second antibody lineage targeted a bnAb contact site, thus selecting Env variants with enhanced binding and neutralization sensitivity for bnAb lineage antibodies. These results demonstrated that cooperation between two B cell lineages early in HIV-1 infection can facilitate the induction of broadly neutralizing CD4bs antibodies. To study the interplay between HIV-1 Env variants and bnAb development in the CH505 individual, we determined neutralization susceptibility of 124 Env pseudoviruses (∼18 per time point) from seven time points after HIV-1 transmission (weeks 4, 14, 20, 30, 53, 78, and 100) to members of the CH103 bnAb lineage (Figures 1 and S1 available online). The CH103 UCA and intermediate antibody (IA) 8 through IA4 only neutralized the CH505 T/F virus. Over time (weeks 4–100), CH505 viruses gradually became more resistant to subsets of the CH103 bnAb lineage antibodies. By week 53, all virus variants were resistant to the early members of the CH103 antibody lineage (UCA and IA8-4). For lineage members that exhibited increased heterologous neutralization (IA3-IA1 and mature CH103, CH104, CH105, and CH106 CD4bs bnAbs), escape was less complete, with a spectrum of sensitive and resistant autologous virus variants isolated from each time point (Figure 1 and Table S1). Thus, pseudoviruses were categorized into sensitive and resistant groups and analyzed for location of accumulated mutations in the env gene (Figure 1).Figure S1Amino Acid Sequence Alignment of Regions in the env Genes Used to Generate Pseudoviruses, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full captionAll sequences are compared to the CH505 T/F Env sequence.

Only V1, V4, V5, loop D, CD4-binding loop regions in the env gene are shown. The identical amino acids are shown as dashes and deletions are shown as dots. Env sequence analysis showed that all but 1 of the 20 viruses resistant to early IAs (IA8-IA4) at week 30 contained insertions (3–12 amino acids) in V1 (Figure 2A). Importantly, the V1 insertions also added 1–4 potential N-linked glycosylation (PNLG) sites (Figures 2A and S2). Although V1 was not seen in the Env-CH103 cocrystal structure (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), a recent cryo-EM structure of the fully glycosylated Env trimer showed that V1/V2 could significantly affect the binding and neutralization of CD4bs bnAbs (Lyumkis et al., 2013Lyumkis D. Julien J.P. de Val N. Cupo A. Potter C.S. Klasse P.J. Burton D.R. Sanders R.W. Moore J.P. Carragher B. et al.Cryo-EM structure of a fully glycosylated soluble cleaved HIV-1 envelope trimer.Science. 2013; 342: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Docking the CH103 bnAb and CH505 Env sequences on the cryo-EM structure showed that an enlarged V1 loop with potential extra glycan(s) might push V2 into positions incompatible with early IA binding (Figures S2A and S2B). All but one of the 16 viruses resistant to later IAs (IA3-IA1) and mature CH103 mAbs had a two or seven amino acid insertions in V5, which is a major Env contact site for the CH103 bnAb heavy chain (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). All resistant viruses from weeks 53, 78, and 100 had insertions in V5 (Figures 1 and S1). The two amino acid (Asp and Thr) insertions could push loop V5 and the glycan at position 461 into a possible clashing position with the light chain of CH103 antibodies (Figure S2C). Introduction of the Asp and Thr into V5 in the T/F Env confirmed that this two amino acid insertion indeed conferred resistance to CH103 lineage mAbs (Figure S2D). We also found one mutation (S365P) in the CD4-binding loop that resulted in a pseudovirus (w14.12) that completely escaped from all members of the CH103 lineage except for weak neutralization susceptibility to mAb CH103 (Figures 1 and S1). These results indicated that early insertions in the V1 and V5 loops as well as site mutations in the CD4-binding loop resulted from CH103 bnAb mediated selection pressure.Figure S2Characterization of the Mutations in V1 and V5, Related with Figure 2Show full caption(A) Insertion and extra glycosylation sites in the V1 loop may change the conformation of the V2 loop and therefore cause steric hindrance for CH103 binding.

The neutralization potency (IC50; μg/ml) is shown. Mutations in V4 were found early on at week 7 and persisted throughout later time points, suggesting that they were strongly selected (Figure S1). Viruses with mutations in a nine amino acid region in V4 were predominant (78%) as early as week 7 and completely replaced the T/F virus population from week 14 onward (Figures S1 and S3A). The N279K mutation in loop D was detected at as early as week 4 (10%), peaked at week 7 (57%), and disappeared from week 14 onward (Figures 3A and S1). In addition, the V281A and V281G mutations were detected at week 7 and week 9, respectively, and both become predominant in later time points together with other mutations in a nine amino acid region in loop D (Figure 3A). Since the mutations in both regions occurred early and their patterns were typical for T cell escape mutations, we performed ELISpot analysis using autologous overlapping peptides to determine if those mutations were driven by CD8+ T cell responses.Figure 3Mutations in Loop D Rendered the Env Mutants More Sensitive to CH103 Lineage bnAb Neutralization with Enhanced Env BindingShow full caption(A) Alignment of nine amino acids in loop D of Env.

(C) Neutralization activity of the nAb CH235 were compared to that of the bnAb CH103 against the CH505 T/F virus and loop D mutants. (D) The fold difference in binding to loop D mutant Envs versus the CH505 T/F Env by both CH103 and CH235 lineage Abs. Seven loop D mutant Envs (M6V281A, M10V281G, M11N279D/V281G, M7E275K/N279D/V281S, M8N280S/V281A, M9E275K/N279D/V281G, and M21N280T/V281A) and the CH505 T/F Env were serially diluted and the log area under the curve (AUC) values for all members of the CH103 and CH235 lineage mAbs were determined by ELISA. The fold difference in log AUC between each loop D mutant Env versus the CH505 T/F Env is shown. See also Figures S3, S4, and S6; Tables S2, S3, and S6. A CD8+ T cell response was detected for a putative T cell epitope (NSTRTITIHC) in V4 (Figure S3B and Table S2). The same peptides containing a T415K mutation, which were detected at week 14, could not be recognized by CD8+ T cells. Four mutants containing individual V4 mutations, including the T415K, had similar neutralization susceptibility to CH103 lineage mAbs as the T/F virus (Figure S3C). These results demonstrated that the predominant mutations in V4 were driven by CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast, no T cell responses were found targeting the loop D or V1, V3, and V5 regions (Table S2). Since the Env loop D region is a binding site for CH103 lineage bnAbs (Liao et al., 2013aLiao H.X. Lynch R. Zhou T. Gao F. Alam S.M. Boyd S.D. Fire A.Z. Roskin K.M. Schramm C.A. Zhang Z. et al.NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramCo-evolution of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody and founder virus.Nature. 2013; 496: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), we next asked if loop D mutations might be due to the selection by CH103 lineage CD4bs antibodies. To test this hypothesis, we introduced loop D mutations at positions 275, 279, 280, and 281, individually or in combination as they occurred in vivo, into the T/F env gene to determine their effect on Env pseudovirus sensitivity to neutralization by the autologous CH103 lineage mAbs. Unexpectedly, all loop D mutations rendered the mutant Env pseudoviruses 4.5-fold (range, 0.4–20) more sensitive than the T/F virus to neutralization by CH103 lineage bnAbs (Figure 3B and Table S3). In addition, when compared to the CH505 T/F virus, four loop D mutants (M5N279K, M6V281A, M7E275K/N279D/V281S, and M10V281G) with one or three mutations were less f"

To investigate how these inputs determine locomotor kinematics, we used whole-field visual motion to drive zebrafish to swim at different speeds. Larvae match the stimulus speed by utilizing more locomotor events, or modifying kinematic parameters such as the duration and speed of swimming bouts, the tail-beat frequency, and the choice of gait. We used laser ablations, electrical stimulation, and activity recordings in descending neurons of the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF) to dissect their contribution to controlling forward movement. We found that the activity of single identified neurons within the nMLF is correlated with locomotor kinematics, and modulates both the duration and oscillation frequency of tail movements. By identifying the contribution of individual supraspinal circuit elements to locomotion kinematics, we build a better understanding of how the brain controls movement."
https://openalex.org/W2037991479,"Tumor–stromal interaction is a dynamic process that promotes tumor growth and metastasis via cell–cell interaction and extracellular vesicles. Recent studies demonstrate that stromal fibroblast-derived molecular signatures can be used to predict disease progression and drug resistance. To identify the epigenetic role of stromal noncoding RNAs in tumor–stromal interactions in the tumor microenvironment, we performed microRNA profiling of patient cancer-associated prostate stromal fibroblasts isolated by laser capture dissection microscopy and in bone-associated stromal models. We found specific upregulation of miR-409-3p and miR-409-5p located within the embryonically and developmentally regulated DLK1-DIO3 (delta-like 1 homolog-deiodinase, iodothyronine 3) cluster on human chromosome 14. The findings in cell lines were further validated in human prostate cancer tissues. Strikingly, ectopic expression of miR-409 in normal prostate fibroblasts conferred a cancer-associated stroma-like phenotype and led to the release of miR-409 via extracellular vesicles to promote tumor induction and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in vitro and in vivo. miR-409 promoted tumorigenesis through repression of tumor suppressor genes such as Ras suppressor 1 and stromal antigen 2. Thus, stromal fibroblasts derived miR-409-induced tumorigenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and stemness of the epithelial cancer cells in vivo. Therefore, miR-409 appears to be an attractive therapeutic target to block the vicious cycle of tumor–stromal interactions that plagues prostate cancer patients."

Our studies provide an example of fine-grained modularity of descending motor control in vertebrates. Elucidating the neural architecture of sensorimotor circuits is fundamental to the broad goal of understanding the neural basis of behavior. Two opposing views concerning the functional organization of such circuits are that they operate in a “distributed” versus “modular” fashion. In the case of a distributed locomotor circuit, it is difficult to assign specific behavioral functions to individual neurons or even small groups of neurons given that global changes in circuit activity determine behavioral outputs. In a modular circuit design, the activity of discrete pools of neurons is dedicated to discrete kinematics, which are combined at the level of the musculature resulting in a complete behavioral program. Such neuronal modules could be used in varying combinations, giving rise to a diverse, seemingly continuous locomotor repertoire. Instead of being purely modular or distributed, it is likely that many behavioral circuits employ a mixture of these architectures. Much of our knowledge of the organization of premotor circuitry has come from the investigation of invertebrate behaviors. Distributed neural coding schemes have been identified for the gill withdrawal reflex of Aplysia californica (Wu et al., 1994Wu J.Y. Cohen L.B. Falk C.X. Neuronal activity during different behaviors in Aplysia: a distributed organization?.Science. 1994; 263: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and the local bending reflex in leech (Lockery and Kristan, 1990Lockery S.R. Kristan Jr., W.B. Distributed processing of sensory information in the leech. II. Identification of interneurons contributing to the local bending reflex.J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1816-1829PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of “command neurons” underlying escape behavior, including the tail-flip response in crayfish, on the other hand, support an extreme version of the module hypothesis (Wiersma, 1947Wiersma C.A.G. Giant nerve fiber system of the crayfish; a contribution to comparative physiology of synapse.J. Neurophysiol. 1947; 10: 23-38PubMed Google Scholar, Boyan et al., 1986Boyan G.S. Ashman S. Ball E.E. Initiation and modulation of flight by a single giant interneurone in the cercal system of the locust.Naturwissensch. 1986; 73: 272-274Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition to reflexive behaviors, studies in the nematode C. elegans have uncovered pools of forward and backward command neurons that promote opposing directions of rhythmic locomotion (Chalfie et al., 1985Chalfie M. Sulston J.E. White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The neural circuit for touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 956-964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, perhaps the best example of modular organization are the central pattern generators (CPGs) in the spinal cord. CPGs produce locomotion by coordinated, rhythmic activity of interneurons and motor neurons (Grillner, 2006Grillner S.

Separate “unit CPGs” control antagonist limb movements, and the interaction between these circuit modules can be recombined to produce variations on a behavior such as changes in gait (Grillner, 2006Grillner S. Biological pattern generation: the cellular and computational logic of networks in motion.Neuron. 2006; 52: 751-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Additionally, an apparently modular organization has been identified in the descending reticulospinal system (RS) for 3D body orientation/orienting in lampreys and for control of neck and back musculature in cats (Pavlova and Deliagina, 2002Pavlova E.L.

Fukushima K. Reticulospinal connections with limb and axial motoneurons.Exp. Brain Res. 1979; 36: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The RS system in larval zebrafish is an attractive model for studies of descending motor control. There are relatively few RS neurons (∼150 on each side of the brain), many of which are individually identifiable from animal to animal (Kimmel et al., 1982Kimmel C.B. Powell S.L. Metcalfe W.K. Brain neurons which project to the spinal cord in young larvae of the zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 205: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the RS system in zebrafish have been interpreted to support either modular (Huang et al., 2013Huang K.-H. Ahrens M.B. Dunn T.W. Engert F.

Evidence for a widespread brain stem escape network in larval zebrafish.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 608-614PubMed Google Scholar). To further address this fundamental question, we investigated the behavioral role of the midbrain nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF). Neurons in the nMLF are the most rostral components of the RS system in larval zebrafish and possess dendrites that contact visual recipient regions as well as axonal projections that innervate circuits in the hindbrain and along the length of the spinal cord (Gahtan and O’Malley, 2003Gahtan E.

Neurol. 2003; 459: 186-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activity in the nMLF has been broadly correlated with multiple sensory stimuli and behaviors, however, its exact function remained undefined (Gahtan et al., 2002Gahtan E. Sankrithi N. Campos J.B.

Activation of a multisensory, multifunctional nucleus in the zebrafish midbrain during diverse locomotor behaviors.Neuroscience. 2010; 166: 970-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We show, by calcium imaging, that activity in nMLF cells is highly correlated with swimming behavior. Unilateral optogenetic activation evoked smooth ipsilateral steering movements, driven by posterior hypaxial musculature, whose amplitude increased roughly linearly with stimulation frequency. In agreement with these activation experiments, unilateral nMLF ablations biased the position of the tail during swims, while leaving other behaviors intact. Together, these findings suggest that a central function of the nMLF is postural control of tail orientation during swimming and provide evidence for modular locomotor control emanating from the midbrain of a vertebrate. To begin to dissect the behavioral role of the nMLF, we searched a library of Gal4 drivers generated by enhancer trapping for lines that allow us to genetically target cells in the nMLF (Baier and Scott, 2009Baier H. Scott E.K. Genetic and optical targeting of neural circuits and behavior—zebrafish in the spotlight.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Scott et al., 2007Scott E.K. Mason L. Arrenberg A.B. Ziv L. Gosse N.J. Xiao T. Chi N.C. Asakawa K. Kawakami K. Baier H. Targeting neural circuitry in zebrafish using GAL4 enhancer trapping.Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 323-326PubMed Google Scholar). This “shelf screen” identified the Gal4s1171t line, which drives expression of UAS-linked transgenes in the midbrain tegmentum including many axons within the MLF (Figures 1A and 1B ). Critical for optogenetic approaches, cell populations directly dorsal or ventral to the tegmentum in Gal4s1171t are not labeled although other brain areas express the transgene (Figure S1 available online). In the tegmentum, ∼600 neurons are labeled in Gal4s1171t with the vast majority localized to medial regions. Lateral portions of the expression pattern have sparser labeling and also contain a dense neuropil. The nMLF is defined in zebrafish as a bilateral cluster of midbrain RS neurons, which are backfilled by neuronal tracers injected into the spinal cord (Kimmel et al., 1982Kimmel C.B. Powell S.L. Metcalfe W.K. Brain neurons which project to the spinal cord in young larvae of the zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 205: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Spinal cord backfills with a dextran-conjugated fluorescent dye revealed that Gal4s1171t labels >80% of neurons within the nMLF, including the four canonical large identified cells MeLr, MeLc, MeLm, and MeM, as well as a population of smaller cells, most of which reside in the dorsal nMLF (Kimmel et al., 1982Kimmel C.B. Powell S.L. Metcalfe W.K. Brain neurons which project to the spinal cord in young larvae of the zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 1982; 205: 112-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A, 1C, and S1; Movies S1 and S2). The small nMLF cells, which we have named mesencephalic small (MeS), are more numerous and vary in position making individual identification by current methods challenging (Figure S1; Movie S2). While most MeS cells are located in dorsolateral positions some of them could also be found ventrally including a pair of identifiable MeS neurons (named MeS1 and MeS2 here). These cells were positioned just lateral to MeLr and were also routinely backfilled with Texas Red dextran (Figures 1C and S1). Antibody staining for choline acetyltransferase coupled with the Gal4s1171t expression pattern revealed that the nMLF lies just rostral to the oculomotor nucleus (Figure 1D). This staining provided evidence that the nMLF is likely not homologous to the midbrain locomotor region (MLR), which has been described in other vertebrates. The MLR is thought to reside more rostrally, is partially cholinergic in nonmammalian vertebrates and has no direct spinal projections (Dubuc et al., 2008Dubuc R. Brocard F. Antri M. Fénelon K. Gariépy J.-F. Smetana R. Ménard A. Le Ray D. Viana Di Prisco G. Pearlstein E. et al.Initiation of locomotion in lampreys.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Movement- and behavioral state-dependent activity of pontine reticulospinal neurons.Neuroscience. 2012; 221: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To label individual nMLF neurons we performed single-cell electroporations of GFP-labeled cells with tetramethylrhodamine dextran in Gal4s1171t/UAS:GFP fish. Our focus was on MeS cells, for which no morphological data existed. We recorded two distinct morphologies for the 15 individual MeS cells that were successfully labeled (Figures 2 and S2). One cell type possessed dendrites that project ventrally and also dendrites that project within the posterior commissure and cross the midline, ramifying in the neuropil of the contralateral nMLF (Figure 2B). Axons of these cells innervate the hindbrain and rostral spinal cord ipsilaterally and terminate roughly a third of the way down the spinal cord (Figures 2E, 2G, and S2; average termination: at the level of myotome 10.8 ± 3). The second MeS cell type extends dendrites that run ventrally and axons that innervate the ipsilateral caudal hindbrain and rostral spinal cord (Figures 2C, 2F, 2G, and S2; average termination: myotome 7.1 ± 3). The two MeLc neurons we labeled had similar dendritic patterns as previously described (Gahtan and O’Malley, 2003Gahtan E. O’Malley D.M. Visually guided injection of identified reticulospinal neurons in zebrafish: a survey of spinal arborization patterns.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 459: 186-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although their axons terminated more caudally than reported (Figure 2G; myotome 20 and 23, respectively). In addition, we labeled an MeLm neuron whose anatomy has not previously been described. This cell had elaborate ventral dendrites and an axon with extensive ipsilateral innervation in the hindbrain and rostral spinal cord and terminated in myotome 19 (Figures 2A, 2D, 2G, and S2). This axon also contained a prominent contralateral collateral in the hindbrain (Figure 2D). In summary, our data extend previous observations of the connectional complexity of nMLF cells. Of particular note, all nMLF cells investigated showed extensive axon collaterals in the hindbrain (in addition to their terminal arbors in the spinal cord), suggesting that they may coordinate the activity of several premotor cell groups and participate in multiple behaviors. To image activity in the nMLF, we expressed the high-signal-to-noise, genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6s (Chen et al., 2013Chen T.-W. Wardill T.J. Sun Y. Pulver S.R. Renninger S.L. Baohan A. Schreiter E.R. Kerr R.A. Orger M.B. Jayaraman V. et al.Ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins for imaging neuronal activity.Nature. 2013; 499: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (3615) Google Scholar) by crossing Gal4s1171t fish to a newly constructed Tg(UAS:GCaMP6s)mpn101 line. We performed two-photon calcium imaging while simultaneously monitoring tail kinematics during spontaneous behaviors with a high speed camera (Movie S3). Animals were head-embedded upright, such that similar populations of neurons in the left and right nMLF were present in the same z plane. Fish exhibited a variety of spontaneous behaviors under our imaging conditions. During individual trials (20 s and 40 s long) we observed slow swims (tail beat frequencies of 18–25 Hz), asymmetric tail flips and struggles. In accordance with previous imaging of the MeL neurons, we observed global activation of MeLc, MeLr, and MeLm during swims, flips, and struggling (Figures 3A, 3C , and S3). We found that swims had the highest probability (98.7%) of evoking responses followed by flips, (78.2%) and struggles (58.3%) (Figure 3D). During all behaviors, including single asymmetric tail flips we observed activity in both the left and right nMLF (Figures 3A and 3C). In trials where multiple closely timed behaviors were present, we observed multiple activations in individual neurons that manifested as compound calcium responses (Figures 3C and S3). While we successfully recorded from each of the large MeL neurons, we could not reliably monitor activity in MeM neurons, as the high density of labeled neurons in medial regions hindered unambiguous identification of these cells. Imaging of the MeS cells revealed that they possess similar response properties to the MeL neurons, with swims again producing the highest probability of responses (97.6%) followed by tail flips (80.7%) and struggles (50%) (Figures 3B and 3D). We observed two distinct populations of MeS neurons based on their response properties. The majority of cells, predominantly located in dorsal regions of the nMLF, had transient responses that mirrored the activity of the MeL cells (Figure 3B). Based on their location, these cells fall into the two morphological types described above. In all animals that were imaged, we also observed a small number of neurons (3–4) in both the left and right ventral nMLF that had slow dynamics. These neurons ramped up activity during intervals between behaviors and had a pronounced decrease in activity following the onset of all behaviors (Figure 3C). In summary, neurons in the nMLF are bilaterally active during swim maneuvers, including those that have highly dissimilar kinematics. To determine the behavioral consequences of nMLF activation, we generated fish in which Gal4s1171t drove expression of the light-activated cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Deisseroth K. Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3370) Google Scholar). For photostimulation experiments, animals were head-embedded in agarose with their tails unrestrained (Figure 4A). A vertically oriented optic fiber (10 μm tip diameter) delivered 473 nm laser light into the fish’s brain, while the tail was imaged at 250 Hz. Stimulation of the caudal midbrain in Gal4s1171t/UAS:ChR2 transgenic fish larvae with a laterally moving fiber resulted in smooth tail deflections that closely followed the position of the fiber (Figure 4B; Movie S4, which provides a dramatic example of this behavior). Stationary fiber stimulation of a small region within 50 μm of the midline on either the left or right side produced a sustained ipsilateral tail deflection that lasted for the duration of the stimulus (Figure S4). Tail deflection amplitudes were equivalent for left and right stimulation sites, with both having a pivot point caudal to the swim bladder in the vicinity of myotome 6 (Figure 4A; Movie S4). Light-induced movements were not observed in Gal4s1171t/UAS:GFP transgenic animals (Figure S4). We identified the stimulation site within the Gal4s1171t expression pattern using fish that expressed both ChR2 and the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede (Ando et al., 2002Ando R. Hama H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Mizuno H. Miyawaki A. An optical marker based on the UV-induced green-to-red photoconversion of a fluorescent protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 12651-12656Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Upon localizing a stimulation position that evoked ipsilateral tail deflections in Gal4s1171t/UAS:ChR2/UAS:Kaede fish, the optic fiber was parked and the laser line switched to 405 nm to photoconvert Kaede at that position. In all 11 fish treated in this manner, a small converted region with a diameter of 10–50 μm, or two mirror-symmetric regions for bilaterally treated fish, was observed (Figures 4C and S5). Converted neurons localized to portions of the Gal4s1171t expression pattern that overlap with laterally situated neurons of the nMLF. Cells in this region included all of the large MeL neurons and also the MeS cells (Figure 4D). From these stimulation and conversion experiments, we conclude that activity in a lateral subregion of the nMLF drives smooth tail deflections, which resemble postural “steering” movements. These movements were striking for their reproducibility within and across animals and because they have not, to our knowledge, been previously observed in response to reticulospinal neuron stimulation. To characterize the behavioral output of the nMLF, we stimulated 30 fish with three different stimulation frequencies (10 Hz, 20 Hz, 30 Hz) on both the left and right sides (Figure 5A). In nearly all fish (95%), 10 Hz stimulation resulted in a detectable ipsilateral steering movement in the tail (Figure 5D). In a minority of cases steering as well as swims or ipsilateral turns were present (13% and 1.6%, respectively; Figure 5D). When stimulation frequency was increased to 20 Hz and then again to 30 Hz, we observed an increase in steer amplitude with a concomitant decrease in steer rise time (Figures 5B, 5C, and S6). Stimulations at 20 Hz and 30 Hz always resulted in detectable steering movements. The probability of eliciting swims that accompanied steering was similar for all conditions (10 Hz 0.13, 20 Hz 0.14, and 30 Hz 0.15, Figure 5D). When they occurred the tail beat frequency and duration of swims were not strongly dependent on stimulation frequency (Figures 5E and S6). These properties of the nMLF are different from those reported for the MLR, where increased activity produces a large increase in gait and swim frequencies in other vertebrates (Shik et al., 1966Shik M.L. Severin F.V. Orlovskiĭ G.N. [Control of walking and running by means of electric stimulation of the midbrain].Biofizika. 1966; 11: 659-666PubMed Google Scholar, Sirota et al., 2000Sirota M.G. Di Prisco G.V. Dubuc R. Stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region elicits controlled swimming in semi-intact lampreys.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast to swims, the probability of ipsilateral and contralateral turns increased with stimulation frequency, with ipsilateral turns being more common (Figure 5D). Turns consisted of either one large tail flip or multiple, laterally biased tail undulations. Increasing the light dose also resulted in a greater probability for trials where all three behaviors were present (steer, swim, and turn) (Figure 5D). To determine if more medial regions of the nMLF produce ChR2-driven behavior we positioned the optic fiber above the midline, equidistant to verified left and right stimulation sites. For the majority of medial stimulation trials, we could not detect a change in tail kinematics (17 of 20 fish) (Figures 5A, 5B, and S6). These results suggest that, when stimulated in isolation, medial regions of the nMLF are not directly involved in moving the tail. We next determined which tail kinematics are produced when the nMLF is bilaterally activated. In these experiments we used a large-diameter (105 μm) optic fiber to excite the entire nMLF region. Here, stimulation using 20 Hz or 30 Hz pulses was capable of producing long bouts of swimming that often lasted the duration of illumination (Figure 5F). However, for the majority of fish stimulated in this fashion, uncoordinated movements were elicited (8 of 12). When long bouts of swimming were present, tail beat frequencies were similar to those for unilateral stimulation (20.5 ± 2.8 Hz), however, bout durations far exceeded the length of swims observed in freely swimming or head-restrained fish (Budick and O’Malley, 2000Budick S.A. O’Malley D.M. Locomotor repertoire of the larval zebrafish: swimming, turning and prey capture.J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 2565-2579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Portugues and Engert, 2011Portugues R. Engert F. Adaptive locomotor behavior in larval zebrafish.Front. Syst. Neurosci. 2011; 5: 72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our Kaede conversion experiments determined that the region within the lateral nMLF where steering is evoked contains the MeL neurons as well as MeS neurons. To resolve the relative contributions of these two populations of neurons to steering, we measured ChR2-evoked steering in Gal4s1171t/UAS:GFP/UAS:ChR2 animals before and after cell-targeted two-photon ablations (Figure 6A). To isolate steering behavior, relatively low stimulation parameters were used to reduce the likelihood of evoking swims or turns. Unilateral ablation of both MeL and MeS neurons (six to eight dorsal MeS neurons, MeS1, MeS2, MeLc, MeLr, and MeLm) dramatically reduced steering on the ipsilateral side while leaving contralateral steering intact (Figure 6B). Targeting just the MeS cells produced a similar reduction, whereas removal of the MeL cells had an intermediate effect (Figure 6C). From these ablation results, we conclude that both neuron types contribute to steering, with a larger contribution coming from the MeS population. Neurons in the nMLF are active when stimuli that drive forward optomotor behavior are presented (Orger et al., 2008Orger M.B. Kampff A.R. Severi K.E. Bollmann J.H. Engert F. Control of visually guided behavior by distinct populations of spinal projection neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To determine the nMLF’s function in this visually guided behavior we performed optogenetic and lesion experiments using a head-fixed optomotor preparation (Figure 7A). In this assay, caudal-to-rostral moving gratings presented on vertically oriented liquid crystal display (LCD) screens elicited forward swims, whereas rotating gratings produced tail flips toward the direction of rotation. Unilateral ChR2 activation of the nMLF introduced an ipsilateral bias to swims evoked by forward moving gratings presented to both eyes (Figures 7B and 7C). This increase in tail angle was most prominent during the first few tail oscillations. In line with these activation experiments, unilateral ablation of neurons in the lateral nMLF (six to eight dorsal MeS neurons, MeS1, MeS2, MeLc, MeLr, and MeLm) caused forward swims to be biased toward the intact side (Figures 7D–7G; Movies S5 and S6). In three animals, we observed a striking tail deflection toward the intact side prior to the onset of tail oscillations (Figure 7F; Movie S6). These deflections resembled steering movements evoked by unilateral ChR2 stimulation. Ablations to isolate the behavioral contribution of the MeL and MeS cell types only uncovered a significant effect on swimming tail angle when MeS neurons were removed (Figure 7H). Bilateral nMLF ablations did not alter tail orientation during swims (Figure S7). Strikingly, unilateral nMLF ablations only affected forward swims, having no detectable effect on the amplitude of turns evoked by ipsiversive or contraversive OMR stimuli (Figures 7D, 7G, and 7H). Bout frequency and bout duration for all three OMR behaviors were unaffected by unilateral removal of nMLF neurons (Figure S7), underpinning the specificity of our ablations. Given the unique and stereotyped steering produced by unilateral nMLF stimulation, we hypothesized that a particular muscle (or group of muscles) may underlie these movements. We took advantage of background muscle expression in Gal4s1171t to conduct ChR2 muscle activation experiments, as well as calcium imaging, in muscle groups following unilateral nMLF stimulation. We found that ipsilateral stimulation of the posterior hypaxial muscles (PHM) (Haines et al., 2004Haines L. Neyt C. Gautier P. Keenan D.G. Bryson-Richardson R.J. Hollway G.E. Cole N.J. Currie P.D. Met and Hgf signaling controls hypaxial muscle and lateral line development in the zebrafish.Development. 2004; 131: 4857-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), a muscle group with previously unknown function, produced robust tail deflections that resembled unilateral activation of the nMLF (Figure 8A). Activation of medial trunk hypaxial muscles (THM) produced only modest tail deflections (Figure 8A). Kaede conversion experiments confirmed the id"
https://openalex.org/W2106875358,"Background The use of both upper extremities (UE) is necessary for the completion of many everyday tasks. Few clinical assessments measure the abilities of the UEs to work together; rather, they assess unilateral function and compare it between affected and unaffected UEs. Furthermore, clinical assessments are unable to measure function that occurs in the real-world, outside the clinic. This study examines the validity of an innovative approach to assess real-world bilateral UE activity using accelerometry. Methods Seventy-four neurologically intact adults completed ten tasks (donning/doffing shoes, grooming, stacking boxes, cutting playdough, folding towels, writing, unilateral sorting, bilateral sorting, unilateral typing, and bilateral typing) while wearing accelerometers on both wrists. Two variables, the Bilateral Magnitude and Magnitude Ratio, were derived from accelerometry data to distinguish between high- and low-intensity tasks, and between bilateral and unilateral tasks. Estimated energy expenditure and time spent in simultaneous UE activity for each task were also calculated. Results The Bilateral Magnitude distinguished between high- and low-intensity tasks, and the Magnitude Ratio distinguished between unilateral and bilateral UE tasks. The Bilateral Magnitude was strongly correlated with estimated energy expenditure (ρ = 0.74, p<0.02), and the Magnitude Ratio was strongly correlated with time spent in simultaneous UE activity (ρ = 0.93, p<0.01) across tasks. Conclusions These results demonstrate face validity and construct validity of this methodology to quantify bilateral UE activity during the performance of everyday tasks performed in a laboratory setting, and can now be used to assess bilateral UE activity in real-world environments."

The phenotype of macrophages is influenced by the wound microenvironment and evolves during healing from a more pro-inflammatory (M1) profile in early stages, to a less inflammatory pro-healing (M2) phenotype in later stages of repair. The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential of exogenous administration of M2 macrophages to promote wound healing in an experimental mouse model of cutaneous injury. Bone marrow derived macrophages were stimulated in-vitro with IL-4 or IL-10 to obtain two different subsets of M2-polarized cells, M2a or M2c respectively. Polarized macrophages were injected into full-thickness excisional skin wounds of either C57BL/6 or diabetic db/db mice. Control groups were injected with non-polarized (M0) macrophages or saline. Our data indicate that despite M2 macrophages exhibit an anti-inflammatory phenotype in-vitro, they do not improve wound closure in wild type mice while they delay healing in diabetic mice. Examination of wounds on day 15 post-injury indicated delayed re-epithelialization and persistence of neutrophils in M2 macrophage treated diabetic wounds. Therefore, topical application of ex-vivo generated M2 macrophages is not beneficial and contraindicated for cell therapy of skin wounds."
https://openalex.org/W2015317857,"Androgen signaling, via the androgen receptor (AR), is crucial in mediating prostate cancer (PCa) initiation and progression. Identifying new downstream effectors of the androgens/AR pathway will allow a better understanding of these mechanisms and could reveal novel biomarkers and/or therapeutic agents to improve the rate of patient survival. We compared the microRNA expression profiles in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells stimulated or not with 1 nM R1881 by performing a high-throughput reverse transcriptase–quantitative PCR and found that miR-135a was upregulated. After androgen stimulation, we showed that AR directly activates the transcription of miR-135a2 gene by binding to an androgen response element in the promoter region. Our findings identify miR-135a as a novel effector in androgens/AR signaling. Using xenograft experiments in chick embryos and adult male mice, we showed that miR-135a overexpression decreases in vivo invasion abilities of prostate PC-3 cells. Through in vitro wound-healing migration and invasion assays, we demonstrated that this effect is mediated through downregulating ROCK1 and ROCK2 expression, two genes that we characterized as miR-135a direct target genes. In human surgical samples from prostatectomy, we observed that miR-135a expression was lower in tumoral compared with paired adjacent normal tissues, mainly in tumors classified with a high Gleason score (⩾8). Moreover, miR-135a expression is lower in invasive tumors, showing extraprostatic extension, as compared with intraprostatic localized tumors. In tumor relative to normal glands, we also showed a more frequently higher ROCK1 protein expression determined using a semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis. Therefore, in tumor cells, the lower miR-135a expression could lead to a higher ROCK1 protein expression, which could explain their invasion abilities. The highlighted relationship between miR-135a expression level and the degree of disease aggressiveness suggests that miR-135a may be considered as a prognostic marker in human PCa."
https://openalex.org/W2004142483,"This study reports the experimental findings and plasma delivery approach developed at the Plasma Bioscience Research Center, Korea for the assessment of antitumor activity of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) for cancer treatment. Detailed investigation of biological effects occurring after atmospheric pressure non-thermal (APNT) plasma application during in vitro experiments revealed the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in modulation of the antioxidant defense system, cellular metabolic activity, and apoptosis induction in cancer cells. To understand basic cellular mechanisms, we investigated the effects of APNT DBD plasma on antioxidant defense against oxidative stress in various malignant cells as well as normal cells. T98G glioblastoma, SNU80 thyroid carcinoma, KB oral carcinoma and a non-malignant HEK293 embryonic human cell lines were treated with APNT DBD plasma and cellular effects due to reactive oxygen species were observed. Plasma significantly decreased the metabolic viability and clonogenicity of T98G, SNU80, KB and HEK293 cell lines. Enhanced ROS in the cells led to death via alteration of total antioxidant activity, and NADP+/NADPH and GSH/GSSG ratios 24 hours (h) post plasma treatment. This effect was confirmed by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining. These consequences suggested that the failure of antioxidant defense machinery, with compromised redox status, might have led to sensitization of the malignant cells. These findings suggest a promising approach for solid tumor therapy by delivering a lethal dose of APNT plasma to tumor cells while sparing normal healthy tissues."

Here, we propose a model in which choice biases arise due to amplified positive reward prediction errors associated with free choice. Using a novel variant of a probabilistic learning task, we show that choice biases are selective to options that are predominantly associated with positive outcomes. A polymorphism in DARPP-32, a gene linked to dopaminergic striatal plasticity and individual differences in reinforcement learning, was found to predict the effect of choice as a function of value. We propose that these choice biases are the behavioral byproduct of a credit assignment mechanism responsible for ensuring the effective delivery of dopaminergic reinforcement learning signals broadcast to the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2078876564,"At synapses in organisms ranging from fly to human, a decrease in postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor function elicits a homeostatic increase in presynaptic release that restores baseline synaptic efficacy. This process, termed presynaptic homeostasis, requires a retrograde, trans-synaptic signal of unknown identity. In a forward genetic screen for homeostatic plasticity genes, we identified multiplexin. Multiplexin is the Drosophila homolog of Collagen XV/XVIII, a matrix protein that can be proteolytically cleaved to release Endostatin, an antiangiogenesis signaling factor. Here we demonstrate that Multiplexin is required for normal calcium channel abundance, presynaptic calcium influx, and neurotransmitter release. Remarkably, Endostatin has a specific activity, independent of baseline synapse development, that is required for the homeostatic modulation of presynaptic calcium influx and neurotransmitter release. Our data support a model in which proteolytic release of Endostatin signals trans-synaptically, acting in concert with the presynaptic CaV2.1 calcium channel, to promote presynaptic homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2046343995,"Gating properties and surface trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are modulated by auxiliary subunits. Here we studied the function of coexpressed auxiliary subunits belonging to two different classes. We focused on TARP γ-8 and CKAMP44 in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, since both subunits are highly expressed in this cell type. TARP γ-8 and CKAMP44 decrease the rate of deactivation but have an opposing influence on receptor desensitization, which accounts for their differential modulation of synaptic short-term plasticity. Furthermore, long-term plasticity (LTP) requires TARP γ-8 but not CKAMP44. The coexpression of both auxiliary subunits is necessary for the efficient targeting of AMPARs to the cell surface of DG granule cells. Finally, electrophysiological and biochemical evidence support the notion that CKAMP44 and TARP γ-8 can be contained in the same AMPAR complex."
https://openalex.org/W2071228993,"Despite several approaches to realize subject-to-subject transfer of pre-trained classifiers, the full performance of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for a novel user can only be reached by presenting the BCI system with data from the novel user. In typical state-of-the-art BCI systems with a supervised classifier, the labeled data is collected during a calibration recording, in which the user is asked to perform a specific task. Based on the known labels of this recording, the BCI's classifier can learn to decode the individual's brain signals. Unfortunately, this calibration recording consumes valuable time. Furthermore, it is unproductive with respect to the final BCI application, e.g. text entry. Therefore, the calibration period must be reduced to a minimum, which is especially important for patients with a limited concentration ability. The main contribution of this manuscript is an online study on unsupervised learning in an auditory event-related potential (ERP) paradigm. Our results demonstrate that the calibration recording can be bypassed by utilizing an unsupervised trained classifier, that is initialized randomly and updated during usage. Initially, the unsupervised classifier tends to make decoding mistakes, as the classifier might not have seen enough data to build a reliable model. Using a constant re-analysis of the previously spelled symbols, these initially misspelled symbols can be rectified posthoc when the classifier has learned to decode the signals. We compare the spelling performance of our unsupervised approach and of the unsupervised posthoc approach to the standard supervised calibration-based dogma for n = 10 healthy users. To assess the learning behavior of our approach, it is unsupervised trained from scratch three times per user. Even with the relatively low SNR of an auditory ERP paradigm, the results show that after a limited number of trials (30 trials), the unsupervised approach performs comparably to a classic supervised model."

The efficacy of cisplatin can be improved by combining it with the vitamin B6 precursor pyridoxine. Here, we evaluated the putative synergistic interaction of CDDP with pyridoxine in the treatment of an orthotopic mouse model of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). CDDP and pyridoxine exhibited hyperadditive therapeutic effects. However, this synergy was only observed in the context of an intact immune system and disappeared when the otherwise successful drug combination was applied to the same NSCLC cancer implanted in the lungs of athymic mice (which lack T lymphocytes). Immunocompetent mice that had been cured from NSCLC by the combined regimen of CDDP plus pyridoxine became resistant against subcutaneous rechallenge with the same (but not with an unrelated) cancer cell line. In vitro, CDDP and pyridoxine did not only cause synergistic killing of NSCLC cells but also elicited signs of immunogenic cell death including an endoplasmic reticulum stress response and exposure of calreticulin at the surface of the NSCLC cells. NSCLC cells treated with CDDP plus pyridoxine in vitro elicited a protective anticancer immune response upon their injection into immunocompetent mice. Altogether, these results suggest that the combined regimen of cisplatin plus pyridoxine mediates immune-dependent antineoplastic effects against NSCLC."

To understand the signaling mechanisms sustaining castration-resistant growth, we implemented a mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic approach and use it to compare protein phosphorylation in orthotopic xenograft tumors grown in either intact or castrated mice. This investigation identified changes in phosphorylation of signaling proteins such as MEK, LYN, PRAS40, YAP1 and PAK2, indicating the concomitant activation of several oncogenic pathways in castration-resistant tumors, a notion that was confirmed by tumor transcriptome analysis. Further analysis demonstrated that the activation of mTORC1, PAK2 and the increased levels of YAP1 in castration-resistant tumors can be explained by the loss of androgen inhibitory actions. The analysis of clinical samples demonstrated elevated levels of PAK2 and YAP1 in castration-resistant tumors, whereas knockdown experiments in androgen-independent cells demonstrated that both YAP1 and PAK2 regulate cell colony formation and cell invasion activity. PAK2 also influenced cell proliferation and mitotic timing. Interestingly, these phenotypic changes occur in the absence of obvious alterations in the activity of AKT, MAPK or mTORC1 pathways, suggesting that PAK2 and YAP1 may represent novel targets for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Pharmacologic inhibitors of PAK2 (PF-3758309) and YAP1 (Verteporfin) were able to inhibit the growth of androgen-independent PC3 xenografts. This work demonstrates the power of applying high-resolution mass spectrometry in the proteomic profiling of tumors grown in vivo for the identification of novel and clinically relevant regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1976412979,"Astrocytes are macroglial cells that have a crucial role in development of the retinal vasculature and maintenance of the blood-retina-barrier (BRB). Diabetes affects the physiology and function of retinal vascular cells including astrocytes (AC) leading to breakdown of BRB. However, the detailed cellular mechanisms leading to retinal AC dysfunction under high glucose conditions remain unclear. Here we show that high glucose conditions did not induce the apoptosis of retinal AC, but instead increased their rate of DNA synthesis and adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins. These alterations were associated with changes in intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell survival, migration and proliferation. High glucose conditions also affected the expression of inflammatory cytokines in retinal AC, activated NF-κB, and prevented their network formation on Matrigel. In addition, we showed that the attenuation of retinal AC migration under high glucose conditions, and capillary morphogenesis of retinal endothelial cells on Matrigel, was mediated through increased oxidative stress. Antioxidant proteins including heme oxygenase-1 and peroxiredoxin-2 levels were also increased in retinal AC under high glucose conditions through nuclear localization of transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2. Together our results demonstrated that high glucose conditions alter the function of retinal AC by increased production of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress with significant impact on their proliferation, adhesion, and migration."

One unresolved issue that has been technically difficult to address in vivo is how weighted descending inputs optimized for synchronous activation of motor pools could generate differential activation of spinal motoneurons, as required for gradations in movement intensity. Here, we address this issue by examining the descending control of axial motor pools in larval zebrafish. As in all vertebrates, in zebrafish larvae, descending commands exert differential control of movement intensity, from powerful escape responses to precise capture maneuvers (Borla et al., 2002Borla M.A. Palecek B.

To do so, they utilize identified spinal motoneurons organized from ventral to dorsal according to their size, excitability, target musculature, and sequence of recruitment (McLean et al., 2007McLean D.L.

Specifically, the ventral-most cells in the pool are the most excitable and are recruited first. This topographic pattern of recruitment provides a unique opportunity to examine how descending inputs interact with a heterogeneously excitable motor pool to generate appropriately graded actions. To this end, we focused on descending inputs arising from the nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (nMLF), a spatially compact, readily identifiable source of reticulospinal drive implicated in visuomotor behaviors (Gahtan and O’Malley, 2003Gahtan E.

We demonstrate that the preferential recruitment of more excitable motoneurons can be achieved by weighted drive from an identified nMLF neuron to the axial motor pool, because commensurate differences in membrane time constants facilitate the temporal summation of tonic inputs. We then explore the activity patterns within the nMLF and spinal motoneurons in response to changes in ambient light levels to assess the behavioral relevance of this phenomenon. Increases and decreases in whole-field illumination are sufficient to make identified neurons within the nMLF fire tonically at frequencies that lead to temporal summation, and also to generate preferential activation of more excitable, ventral motoneurons. Thus, our findings now provide a generalizable mechanism for graded recruitment patterns via weighted descending inputs that relies on the biophysical properties of target motoneurons and their sensitivity to tonic drive. We first examined the axon collateral distribution in the spinal cord of nMLF neurons, including the identified Medial-Medial (MeM); Medial-Lateral, caudal (MeLc); and Medial-Lateral, rostral (MeLr) neurons (Figures 1A1–1A3 ). Neurons within the nMLF were first retrogradely labeled by dye injection into the spinal cord, and then one of the three identified nMLF somata was filled with a different colored dye by single-cell electroporation (Figures 1B and 1C).

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 10925-10939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we examined axon collateral distributions parasagitally (Figures 1D1–1D4), and their dorso-ventral distribution was analyzed between body segments 5–14, where the height (distance between the dorsal and ventral boundaries) of the spinal cord is relatively constant. In five fish, two of the nMLF neurons (MeLr/MeLc, MeLr/MeM, or MeLc/MeM) were electroporated using different colored dyes for direct comparison of projection patterns within fish (Figures 1B, 1C, 1E, and 1F). While all identified nMLF neurons had main axons that descended ventro-medially in the spinal cord, there were differences in the dorso-ventral distribution of collaterals arising from the main axon. Compared to the MeLr, the MeM and MeLc axon collaterals extended more dorsally in the spinal cord (Figures 1E–1H). Like the MeLr, smaller, nonidentified neurons within the nMLF had axon collaterals that remained ventral (Figure S1 available online). Due to the finer processes of the smaller cells, we could not be totally confident that their axons were completely filled. However, for the spinal projection patterns of the larger MeM, MeLc, and MeLr neurons, where we could be confident of complete filling, the differences in dorso-ventral projection held true for pooled data from multiple fish (Figure 1I, n = 5 for each cell type). Thus, the most dorsal axon collaterals (above spinal dorso-ventral division 0.5) were exclusively from the MeM and MeLc neurons. To relate these projection patterns to potential connections with axial motoneurons, we performed single-cell electroporations of the MeM, MeLc, and MeLr neurons in the pargmn2Et enhancer trap line, in which motoneurons are labeled with GFP (Figures 2A1 and 2A2). The MeM and MeLc both had extensive axon collaterals that reached the dorsal-most aspect of the axial motor column (Figures 2B1 and 2C1). There were also extensive ventral collaterals (Figures 2B1 and 2C1), where motoneurons are more numerous (Menelaou et al., 2014Menelaou E. VanDunk C. McLean D.L. Differences in the morphology of spinal V2a neurons reflect their recruitment order during swimming in larval zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 2014; 522: 1232-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Collaterals throughout the dorso-ventral axis penetrated the soma layer, which is most obvious from a coronal view (Figures 2B2 and 2C2). Digital reconstructions followed by registration to anatomical landmarks confirmed this pattern and also demonstrated that both the MeM and MeLc had bilateral projections (Figure 2E). Thus, one of the potential targets included large, dorsally located, early-born “primary” motoneurons (PMns) (Myers, 1985Myers P.Z. Spinal motoneurons of the larval zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 236: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To confirm this potential connection, we performed in vivo paired patch-clamp recordings from the large identified nMLF neurons and large identified PMns (Figure 2F). Consistent with the anatomical observations, we found evidence for direct synaptic connections to PMns from the MeM and MeLc neurons (Figures 2G and 2H). Current-evoked firing in the MeM or MeLc neurons elicited excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in PMns with two components (Figures 2G and 2H). The early component had a short, relatively fixed latency in both the MeM (mean ±SEM, 0.92 ± 0.10 ms, coefficient of variation or CV = 0.04) and MeLc (1.05 ± 0.07 ms, CV = 0.04) and a relatively fixed amplitude in both classes (MeM, 1.89 ± 0.29 mV, CV = 0.08; MeLc, 2.39 ± 0.61 mV, CV = 0.07; n = 4 MeM-PMn and 9 MeLc-PMn pairs). In addition, the early component followed MeM and MeLc action potentials reliably without failure, even at extremely high firing rates (up to 500 Hz). These features suggest a monosynaptic, electrical connection between the MeM and MeLc neurons and PMns. The later component occurred less reliably and had larger variability in both latency (MeM, 1.62 ± 0.07 ms, CV = 0.13; MeLc, 1.88 ± 0.36 ms, CV = 0.24) and peak amplitude (MeM, 1.23 ± 0.11 mV, CV = 0.20; MeLc, 1.84 ± 0.17 mV, CV = 0.16), which is more consistent with a chemical connection (Kimura et al., 2006Kimura Y. Okamura Y. Higashijima S. alx, a zebrafish homolog of Chx10, marks ipsilateral descending excitatory interneurons that participate in the regulation of spinal locomotor circuits.J.

Continuous shifts in the active set of spinal interneurons during changes in locomotor speed.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In contrast to the MeM and MeLc, the more ventrally located MeLr axon collaterals ramified laterally in the neuropil layer (Figures 2D1, 2D2, and 2E), as did the collaterals of the smaller nMLF cells (Figure S1). However, since the dendrites and axons of all axial motoneurons intermingle in the neuropil (Kishore and Fetcho, 2013Kishore S. Fetcho J.R. Homeostatic regulation of dendritic dynamics in a motor map in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this did not rule out the possibility that the MeLr and smaller nMLF cells could still make contact with more dorsal motoneurons. Consistent with this idea, we found connections between MeLr neurons and PMns (Figure 2I) that also contained an early component with a relatively fixed latency (1.28 ± 0.22 ms, CV = 0.05) and amplitude (1.07 ± 0.14 mV, CV = 0.08) and a later component with more variable latency (2.05 ± 0.32 ms, CV = 0.13) and amplitude (0.92 ± 0.06 mV, CV = 0.32; n = 3 MeLr-PMn pairs). Despite the greater likelihood that MeLr-PMn connections were axonal and/or dendritic and thus more distant from the somatic recording site, we found no significant differences in the amplitude of the early component EPSP among the three identified neurons (Figure 2J). Only the late component demonstrated any statistically significant difference, and this was restricted to the MeLc-PMn connection, when compared to the MeM and MeLr pairs (Figure 2J). Thus, the anatomical and physiological data suggest that nMLF neurons have the capacity to make connections to neurons distributed throughout the axial motor pool, which include the smaller, more ventrally distributed, later-born “secondary” motoneurons (SMns; Myers, 1985Myers P.Z. Spinal motoneurons of the larval zebrafish.J. Comp. Neurol. 1985; 236: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We next investigated the nature of connectivity between PMns and SMns and focused on connections arising from the MeLc neuron, due to its more superficial, accessible location in the nMLF and the greater likelihood of finding somatic connections throughout the axial motor pool based on its anatomy. To reveal the nature of connectivity between the MeLc neuron and the axial motor pool, we targeted PMns and SMns located between body segments 10–13. Similar to the MeLc-PMn connection, the MeLc-elicited EPSPs in SMns also contained an early, reliable component with relatively constant latency (1.20 ± 0.05 ms, CV = 0.06) and amplitude (2.57 ± 0.38 mV, CV = 0.07; n = 13 MeLc-SMn pairs). There was also a later, less reliable component with more variable latency (2.25 ± 0.09 ms, CV = 0.26) and amplitude (2.76 ± 0.41 mV, CV = 0.25; n = 10 MeLc-SMn pairs). In both PMns and SMns, dual component EPSPs were resistant to a reduction in the likelihood of neurotransmission after perfusion of high-divalent cation extracellular solution (Figures 3A and 3B), consistent with a monosynaptic connection (Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957Frankenhaeuser B. Hodgkin A.L. The action of calcium on the electrical properties of squid axons.J. Physiol. 1957; 137: 218-244PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the later component in both classes was sensitive to a mixture of the glutamate receptor antagonists NBQX/AP5, consistent with a glutamatergic, chemical synaptic connection (Figures 3A and 3B). Critically, however, in control solutions the amplitude of both the electrical and glutamatergic components was indistinguishable between PMns and SMns, despite dramatic differences in input resistance (Rin) between the two populations (Figures 3E1 and 3G1). This is consistent with experiments that failed to demonstrate any difference in EPSP amplitudes related to Rin in limb motoneurons (Burke and Rymer, 1976Burke R.E. Rymer W.Z. Relative strength of synaptic input from short-latency pathways to motor units of defined type in cat medial gastrocnemius.J.

Convergent effects on alpha motoneurones from the vestibulospinal tract and a pathway descending in the medial longitudinal fasciculus.Exp. Brain Res. 1971; 12: 457-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, although the chemical component was highly variable, we found that it was more reliable in PMns than in SMns (Figure 3F). Both observations are consistent with the idea that descending drive is weighted such that less excitable motoneurons receive more excitation, and we now extend this observation to individual reticulospinal inputs. Despite similarities in the amplitudes of MeLc-evoked EPSPs in PMns and SMns, we did observe differences in their waveforms (Figures 3C and 3D). Both the electrical and chemical components of EPSPs in SMns were broader and had a slower decay than EPSPs in PMns. To quantify this observation, we took advantage of the variable reliability of the later chemical component to separately analyze PSPs with purely electrical components and those with clear chemical components. Specifically, we focused on how the following features of EPSPs related to the Rin of spinal motoneurons: (1) 10%–90% rise time, (2) half width, and (3) decay time constant (Figure 3E2–3E4). For purely electrical components, the rise time, half width, and decay time constant increased with motoneuron Rin (Figures 3E2–3E4). We confirmed that this observation was not contaminated by a residual chemical contribution by measuring the same properties in the presence of NBQX/AP5 (Figure S2). Although the early electrical component precluded measurement of the rise time of the chemical component, this same pattern was evident when we analyzed PSPs containing a clear chemical component (Figures 3G2 and 3G3). The systematic broadening of the chemical as well as the electrical component is most simply explained by longer membrane time constants, although it is possible that SMns also express a higher ratio of NMDA to AMPA receptors or generally have slower postsynaptic kinetics. Furthermore, in the MeM- and MeLr-PMn pairs, MeM- and MeLr-elicited EPSPs also show narrower waveform and a fast decay similar to the MeLc-elicited EPSPs in PMns, suggesting that this feature is not restricted to the MeLc-motoneuron connection and instead reflects an intrinsic attribute of PMns (Figure S2). The slower decay of EPSPs in higher Rin SMns could provide a larger time window for EPSP summation. To test whether differences in temporal summation could indeed generate differences in motoneuron recruitment, we evoked action potentials up to 600 Hz in the MeLc neuron (“Pre”) using current steps and examined whether the motoneuron (“Post”) could be driven to fire (Figures 4A and 4B). In the nine MeLc-PMn pairs, we never observed firing in the PMn (Figure 4A). On the other hand, for three MeLc-SMn pairs, firing the MeLc neuron could make the SMn fire (Figure 4B). When we examined the response of the PMn and SMn at the onset of the current step (Figures 4C and 4D), we found that at low MeLc firing rates PMns and SMns showed a relatively equivalent amount of summation, as quantified by generating a slope from the peak of the first two PSPs in the train (Figure 4E). However, while the PMn exhibited little increase in slope at progressively increasing MeLc firing rates (low gain), in the SMn the increased temporal summation produced an ever-increasing slope with increasing MeLc firing rates (high gain). We then compared the relative gain of responses to current steps in eight motoneurons where the MeLc was driven to fire over a comparable frequency range (100–600 Hz). The excitatory gain systematically increases with increases in the EPSP decay time constant (Figure 4F), as expected if Rin was contributing to the efficacy of temporal summation. The contribution of Rin to temporal summation of EPSPs assumes that there are systematic differences in membrane time constant related to Rin. To examine the relationship between membrane time constant and motoneuron Rin, we performed whole-cell recordings from individual spinal motoneurons (n = 41), which covered the full range of motoneuron Rin (∼30–1000 MΩ) (Menelaou and McLean, 2012Menelaou E. McLean D.L. A gradient in endogenous rhythmicity and oscillatory drive matches recruitment order in an axial motor pool.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 10925-10939Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A brief (1 ms) hyperpolarizing current was delivered, and membrane potential decay was fitted with a single exponential equation to calculate the time constant. Similar to the EPSP decay time constant, the membrane decay time constant measured somatically also increased with motoneuron Rin (Figure 4G). Thus, the entire motor pool exhibits a gradient in both Rin and membrane time constant that would provide systematically greater temporal summation of excitatory inputs. The findings thus far suggest that nMLF neurons have the potential to make contacts with spinal motoneurons throughout the dorso-ventral axis either via somatic or axonal/dendritic connections. In addition, our assessment of MeLc output to axial motoneurons suggests that it is biased to less excitable cells but can result in selective activation of more excitable ones via temporal summation. To do so, however, the MeLc must fire tonically at frequencies exceeding 200 Hz (Figures 4B and 4D). Given that these are extremely rapid rates of firing, it is not clear if this would occur naturally. To begin to address this question, we investigated in more detail the activity patterns of neurons within the nMLF during motor behavior. Our first goal was to identify a sensory stimulus that would drive reliable activation of the nMLF. Given its acknowledged sensitivity to visual stimuli (Orger et al., 2008Orger M.B. Kampff A.R.

Activation of a multisensory, multifunctional nucleus in the zebrafish midbrain during diverse locomotor behaviors.Neuroscience. 2010; 166: 970-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we chose a simple, controllable source of photic stimulation, namely a light emitting diode (LED), to generate sudden increases and decreases in whole-field illumination. We then utilized calcium imaging to assess activity in the nMLF combined with peripheral motor nerve recordings to monitor motor responses (Figure 5A). In these experiments, the fish is immobilized with α-bungarotoxin, and the bursts of motor activity that would normally drive movements (“fictive”) can be monitored (Figure 5A). In response to an LED, motor activity was reliably observed in response to both light onset and offset (Figure 5B). In some instances, spontaneous motor activity unrelated to light stimuli was also observed (gray arrowheads, Figure 5B). There was no significant difference in the delay related to whether the light was turned on or turned off (light onset, 219.32 ± 17.91 ms; light offset, 215.11 ± 11.60 ms; Mann-Whitney U test, p > 0.05, n = 10 fish). Next, to examine the recruitment pattern of neurons within the nMLF, the location of cells was normalized using the midline of the brain and the center of the MeLr neuron as medio-lateral (M-L) references (Figure 5C). While the responses to light onset within the nMLF were highly variable (Figure 5E), the vast majority exceeded the 9% ΔF/F value, which can be used as a conservative estimate of suprathreshold activity (Figure S3) (Bhatt et al., 2007Bhatt D.H.

O’Malley D.M. Visualization of active neural circuitry in the spinal cord of intact zebrafish.J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 399-406PubMed Google Scholar). Averages of responses binned according to M-L location revealed significantly less activity in neurons found in the most medial bin and those found in the four most lateral bins (Figure 5G). The MeM, which is located in the most medial bin, also responded less robustly than either the MeLr or MeLc in response to light onset (Figure 5G). In contrast, responses to light offset were more homogeneous (Figure 5E), with no significant difference related to binned M-L location or neuron identity (Figure 5G). These data suggest that whole-field changes in illumination are a reliable means to generate motor responses and to activate neurons distributed throughout the nMLF. How might this compare to responses in the axial motor pool? When we examined the recruitment patterns of axial motoneurons distributed throughout the dorso-ventral plane (Figure 5D), both light onset and offset consistently activated predominantly ventral motoneurons (Figures 5F and 5H). The contrasting responses of the nMLF and axial motor pools are readily apparent by representing activity as a simple re"
https://openalex.org/W1997406166,"Urbanization drastically alters natural ecosystems and the structure of their plant and animal communities. Whereas some species cope successfully with these environmental changes, others may go extinct. In the case of parasite communities, the expansion of urban areas has a critical effect by changing the availability of suitable substrates for the eggs or free-larval stages of those species with direct life cycles or for the range of hosts of those species with complex cycles. In this study we investigated the influence of the degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity on helminth richness, abundance and community structure of rufous-bellied thrushes (Turdus rufiventris) along a rural-urban gradient in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This common native bird species of southern Brazil hosts 15 endoparasite species at the study region. A total of 144 thrushes were collected with mist nets at 11 sites. The degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity were estimated by quantifying five landscape elements: buildings, woodlands, fields, bare lands, and water. Landscape analyses were performed at two spatial scales (10 and 100 ha) taking into account home range size and the potential dispersal distance of thrushes and their prey (intermediate hosts). Mean parasite richness showed an inverse relationship with the degree of urbanization, but a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity. Changes in the structure of component communities along the rural-urban gradient resulted from responses to the availability of particular landscape elements that are compatible with the parasites' life cycles. We found that the replacement of natural environments with buildings breaks up host-parasite interactions, whereas a higher environmental (substrate) diversity allows the survival of a wider range of intermediate hosts and vectors and their associated parasites."

Furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically ill patients. A novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well as selected extended (ESBL) and narrow spectrum (NSBL) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. Additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter freundii/braakii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. The assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. For these isolates, phenotypic identifications and susceptibility tests were available. An independent detection of carbapenemase, ESBL and NSBL genes was carried out by various external reference laboratories using PCR methods. In direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. This included blaVIM (13 out of 13), blaGIM (2/2), blaKPC (27/27), blaNDM (5/5), blaIMP-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaOXA-23 (12/13), blaOXA-40-group (7/7), blaOXA-48-group (32/33), blaOXA-51 (1/1) and blaOXA-58 (1/1). Furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaOXA-1 (16/16), blaOXA-2 (4/4), blaOXA-9 (33/33), OXA-10 (3/3), blaOXA-51 (25/25), blaOXA-58 (2/2), CTX-M1/M15 (17/17) and blaVIM (1/1)].

https://openalex.org/W2077598365,"Background Acute and chronic hepatitis E have been associated with high mortality and development of cirrhosis, particularly in solid-organ recipients and patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus. However, data regarding the epidemiology of hepatitis E in special populations is still limited. Aims Investigate seroprevalence and possible factors associated with HEV infection in a large cohort of immunosuppressed patients. Methods Cross-sectional study testing IgG anti-HEV in serum samples from 1373 consecutive individuals: 332 liver-transplant, 296 kidney-transplant, 6 dual organ recipients, 301 non-transplanted patients with chronic liver disease, 238 HIV-infected patients and 200 healthy controls. Results IgG anti-HEV was detected in 3.5% controls, 3.7% kidney recipients, 7.4% liver transplant without cirrhosis and 32.1% patients who developed post-transplant cirrhosis (p<0.01). In patients with chronic liver disease, IgG anti-HEV was also statistically higher in those with liver cirrhosis (2% vs 17.5%, p<0.01). HIV-infected patients showed an IgG anti-HEV rate of 9.2%, higher than those patients without HIV infection (p<0.03). Multivariate analysis showed that the factors independently associated with anti-HEV detection were liver cirrhosis, liver transplantation and HIV infection (OR: 7.6, 3.1 and 2.4). HCV infection was a protective factor for HEV infection (OR: 0.4). Conclusions HEV seroprevalence was high in liver transplant recipients, particularly those with liver cirrhosis. The difference in anti-HEV prevalence between Liver and Kidney transplanted cases suggests an association with advanced liver disease. Further research is needed to ascertain whether cirrhosis is a predisposing factor for HEV infection or whether HEV infection may play a role in the pathogeneses of cirrhosis."
https://openalex.org/W1972501434,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis owing to aggressive phenotype. Gα12 gep oncogene product couples to G-protein-coupled receptors, whose ligand levels are frequently increased in tumor microenvironments. Here, we report Gα12 overexpression in human HCC and the resultant induction of zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) as mediated by microRNA deregulation. Gα12 expression was higher in HCC than surrounding non-tumorous tissue. Transfection of Huh7 cell with an activated mutant of Gα12 (Gα12QL) deregulated microRNA (miRNA or miR)-200b/a/429, -194-2/192 and -194-1/215 clusters in the miRNome. cDNA microarray analyses disclosed the targets affected by Gα12 gene knockout. An integrative network of miRNAs and mRNA changes enabled us to predict ZEB1 as a key molecule governed by Gα12. Decreases of miR-200a/b, -192 and -215 by Gα12 caused ZEB1 induction. The ability of Gα12 to decrease p53 levels, as a result of activating protein-1 (AP-1)/c-Jun-mediated mouse double minute 2 homolog induction, contributed to transcriptional deregulation of the miRNAs. Gα12QL induced ZEB1 and other epithelial–mesenchymal transition markers with fibroblastoid phenotype change. Consistently, transfection with miR-200b, -192 or -215 mimic prevented the ability of Gα12QL to increase tumor cell migration/invasion. In xenograft studies, sustained knockdown of Gα12 decreased the overall growth rate and average volume of tumors derived from SK-Hep1 cell (mesenchymal-typed). In HCC patients, miR-192, -215 and/or -200a were deregulated with microvascular invasion or growth advantage. In the HCC samples with higher Gα12 level, a correlation existed in the comparison of relative changes of Gα12 and ZEB1. In conclusion, Gα12 overexpressed in HCC causes ZEB1 induction by deregulating p53-responsive miRNAs, which may facilitate epithelial–mesenchymal transition and growth of liver tumor. These findings highlight the significance of Gα12 upregulation in liver tumor progression, implicating Gα12 as an attractive therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W1984575008,"Although it is generally accepted that visual information guides steering, it is still unclear whether a curvature matching strategy or a 'look where you are going' strategy is used while steering through a curved road. The current experiment investigated to what extent the existing models for curve driving also apply to cycling around a curve, and tested the influence of cycling speed on steering and gaze behavior. Twenty-five participants were asked to cycle through a semicircular lane three consecutive times at three different speeds while staying in the center of the lane. The observed steering behavior suggests that an anticipatory steering strategy was used at curve entrance and a compensatory strategy was used to steer through the actual bend of the curve. A shift of gaze from the center to the inside edge of the lane indicates that at low cycling speed, the 'look where you are going' strategy was preferred, while at higher cycling speeds participants seemed to prefer the curvature matching strategy. Authors suggest that visual information from both steering strategies contributes to the steering system and can be used in a flexible way. Based on a familiarization effect, it can be assumed that steering is not only guided by vision but that a short-term learning component should also be taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2038899998,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can grow to very high-cell-density (HCD) during infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major component of lung surfactant, has been hypothesized to support HCD growth of P. aeruginosa in vivo. The phosphorylcholine headgroup, a glycerol molecule, and two long-chain fatty acids (FAs) are released by enzymatic cleavage of PC by bacterial phospholipase C and lipases. Three different bacterial pathways, the choline, glycerol, and fatty acid degradation pathways, are then involved in the degradation of these PC components. Here, we identified five potential FA degradation (Fad) related fadBA-operons (fadBA1-5, each encoding 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA thiolase). Through mutagenesis and growth analyses, we showed that three (fadBA145) of the five fadBA-operons are dominant in medium-chain and long-chain Fad. The triple fadBA145 mutant also showed reduced ability to degrade PC in vitro. We have previously shown that by partially blocking Fad, via mutagenesis of fadBA5 and fadDs, we could significantly reduce the ability of P. aeruginosa to replicate on FA and PC in vitro, as well as in the mouse lung. However, no studies have assessed the ability of mutants, defective in choline and/or glycerol degradation in conjunction with Fad, to grow on PC or in vivo. Hence, we constructed additional mutants (ΔfadBA145ΔglpD, ΔfadBA145ΔbetAB, and ΔfadBA145ΔbetABΔglpD) significantly defective in the ability to degrade FA, choline, and glycerol and, therefore, PC. The analysis of these mutants in the BALB/c mouse lung infection model showed significant inability to utilize PC in vitro, resulted in decreased replication fitness and competitiveness in vivo compared to the complement strain, although there was little to no variation in typical virulence factor production (e.g., hemolysin, lipase, and protease levels). This further supports the hypothesis that lung surfactant PC serves as an important nutrient for P. aeruginosa during CF lung infection."
https://openalex.org/W2107595942,"We investigate whether the profile of factors protecting psychosocial functioning of high risk exposed Australian Aboriginal youth are the same as those promoting psychosocial functioning in low risk exposed youth. Data on 1,021 youth aged 12-17 years were drawn from the Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (WAACHS 2000-2002), a population representative survey of the health and well-being of Aboriginal children, their families and community contexts. A person-centered approach was used to define four groups of youth cross-classified according to level of risk exposure (high/low) and psychosocial functioning (good/poor). Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the influence of individual, family, cultural and community factors on psychosocial outcomes separately for youth in high and low family-risk contexts. Results showed that in high family risk contexts, prosocial friendship and low area-level socioeconomic status uniquely protected psychosocial functioning. However, in low family risk contexts the perception of racism increased the likelihood of poor psychosocial functioning. For youth in both high and low risk contexts, higher self-esteem and self-regulation were associated with good psychosocial functioning although the relationship was non-linear. These findings demonstrate that an empirical resilience framework of analysis can identify potent protective processes operating uniquely in contexts of high risk and is the first to describe distinct profiles of risk, protective and promotive factors within high and low risk exposed Australian Aboriginal youth."
https://openalex.org/W2110645247,"To mitigate eutrophication in fresh standing waters the focus is on phosphorus (P) control, i.e. on P inflows to a lake as well as a lake's sediment as internal P source. The in-lake application of the lanthanum (La) modified clays – i.e. La modified bentonite (Phoslock) or La modified kaolinite, aim at dephosphatising the water column and at reducing the release of P from a lake's sediment. Application of these clays raises the question whether La from these clays can become bioavailable to biota. We investigated the bioavailability of La from Phoslock in a controlled parallel groups experiment in which we measured the La in carapace, gills, ovaries, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle after 0, 14 and 28 days of exposure to Phoslock. Expressing the treatment effect as the difference of the median concentration between the two treatment groups (Phoslock minus control group) yield the following effects, the plus sign (+) indicating an increase, concentrations in µg g−1 dry weight: Day 14: carapace +10.5 µg g−1, gills +112 µg g−1, ovaries +2.6 µg g−1, hepatopancreas +32.9 µg g−1 and abodminal muscle +3.2 µg g−1. Day 28: carapace +17.9 µg g−1; gills +182 µg g−1; ovaries +2.2 µg g−1; hepatopancreas +41.9 µg g−1 and abodminal muscle +7.6 µg g−1, all effects were statistically significant. As La from Phoslock is bio-available to and taken up by the marbled crayfishes (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis), we advocate that the application of in-lake chemical water treatments to mitigate eutrophication should be accompanied by a thorough study on potential side effects."
https://openalex.org/W2089748048,"Background While the importance of record linkage is widely recognised, few studies have attempted to quantify how linkage errors may have impacted on their own findings and outcomes. Even where authors of linkage studies have attempted to estimate sensitivity and specificity based on subjects with known status, the effects of false negatives and positives on event rates and estimates of effect are not often described. Methods We present quantification of the effect of sensitivity and specificity of the linkage process on event rates and incidence, as well as the resultant effect on relative risks. Formulae to estimate the true number of events and estimated relative risk adjusted for given linkage sensitivity and specificity are then derived and applied to data from a prisoner mortality study. The implications of false positive and false negative matches are also discussed. Discussion Comparisons of the effect of sensitivity and specificity on incidence and relative risks indicate that it is more important for linkages to be highly specific than sensitive, particularly if true incidence rates are low. We would recommend that, where possible, some quantitative estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the linkage process be performed, allowing the effect of these quantities on observed results to be assessed."
https://openalex.org/W2062968161,"Broiler breeders (parents of meat chickens) are selected for fast growth and become obese if fed ad libitum. To avoid this and maintain good health and reproductive ability, they are feed restricted to about 1/3 of what they would eat ad libitum. As a result, they experience chronic hunger and exhibit abnormal behaviour patterns that may indicate stress and frustration. One approach to measuring hunger is to observe how much birds will work, such as pecking a key, for access to more or different types of food. However, the sight, smell, and feedback from consumption of the feed reward changes the context and may artificially raise feeding motivation. To avoid this, we tested broiler breeders in an apparatus in which they could work for access to a wooden platform covered in wood shavings by crossing a water runway which increased in length and depth in 8 successive tests. In the wood shavings area, they could perform exploratory and foraging behaviour (the appetitive phase of feeding) but were never rewarded with feed. Sixty birds were divided into three feed quantity treatments: commercial restriction (R), and twice (2R) or three times (3R) this amount. Overall, birds fed R worked harder to reach the wood shavings area (reached it in a larger number of tests) than 2R and 3R birds (P<0.001). More restricted birds took less time to reach the area (P<0.001, R<2R<3R) and spent more time foraging while there (P<0.001, R>2R>3R). This indicates that restricted-fed birds were hungry and willing to work for the opportunity to forage even though food was never provided, suggesting that their motivation to perform the appetitive component of feeding behaviour (foraging/food searching) was sufficient to sustain their response. Thus food restriction in broiler breeders is a welfare concern. However these methods could be used to test alternative feeding regimes to attempt to find ways of alleviating hunger while still maintaining healthy growth and reproduction in these birds."
https://openalex.org/W2094550737,"Background Assessment of health effects of a forest environment is an important emerging area of public health and environmental sciences. Purpose To demonstrate the long-term health effects of living in a forest environment on subclinical cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) compared with that in an urban environment. Materials and Methods This study included the detailed health examination and questionnaire assessment of 107 forest staff members (FSM) and 114 urban staff members (USM) to investigate the long-term health effects of a forest environment. Air quality monitoring between the forest and urban environments was compared. In addition, work-related factors and HRQOL were evaluated. Results Levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose in the USM group were significantly higher than those in the FSM group. Furthermore, a significantly higher intima-media thickness of the internal carotid artery was found in the USM group compared with that in the FSM group. Concentrations of air pollutants, such as NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, CO, PM2.5, and PM10 in the forest environment were significantly lower compared with those in the outdoor urban environment. Working hours were longer in the FSM group; however, the work stress evaluation as assessed by the job content questionnaire revealed no significant differences between FSM and USM. HRQOL evaluated by the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF questionnaire showed FSM had better HRQOL scores in the physical health domain. Conclusions This study provides evidence of the potential beneficial effects of forest environments on CVDs and HRQOL."

Disease activity was assessed using the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28) at baseline and at three and 12 months. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate whether improved disease activity is related to serum visfatin or a change in visfatin level.Serum visfatin was significantly elevated in early RA patients compared to healthy controls (1.92±1.17 vs. 1.36±0.93 ng/ml; p = 0.034) and significantly decreased after three months of treatment (to 0.99±0.67 ng/ml; p<0.001). Circulating visfatin and a change in visfatin level correlated with disease activity and improved disease activity over time, respectively. A decrease in visfatin after three months predicted a DAS28 improvement after 12 months. In addition, decreased serum visfatin was not associated with an improved atherogenic index but was associated with an increase in total cholesterol level.A short-term decrease in circulating visfatin may represent an independent predictor of long-term disease activity improvement in patients with early RA."
https://openalex.org/W2042769790,"In today's technology-assisted society, social interactions may be expressed through a variety of techno-communication channels, including online social networks, email and mobile phones (calls, text messages). Consequently, a clear grasp of human behavior through the diverse communication media is considered a key factor in understanding the formation of the today's information society. So far, all previous research on user communication behavior has focused on a sole communication activity. In this paper we move forward another step on this research path by performing a multidimensional study of human sociality as an expression of the use of mobile phones. The paper focuses on user temporal communication behavior in the interplay between the two complementary communication media, text messages and phone calls, that represent the bi-dimensional scenario of analysis. Our study provides a theoretical framework for analyzing multidimensional bursts as the most general burst category, that includes one-dimensional bursts as the simplest case, and offers empirical evidence of their nature by following the combined phone call/text message communication patterns of approximately one million people over three-month period. This quantitative approach enables the design of a generative model rooted in the three most significant features of the multidimensional burst - the number of dimensions, prevalence and interleaving degree - able to reproduce the main media usage attitude. The other findings of the paper include a novel multidimensional burst detection algorithm and an insight analysis of the human media selection process."
https://openalex.org/W2068520367,"Selenium is transferred from the mouse dam to its neonate via milk. Milk contains selenium in selenoprotein form as selenoprotein P (Sepp1) and glutathione peroxidase-3 (Gpx3) as well as in non-specific protein form as selenomethionine. Selenium is also present in milk in uncharacterized small-molecule form. We eliminated selenomethionine from the mice in these experiments by feeding a diet that contained sodium selenite as the source of selenium. Selenium-replete dams with deletion of Sepp1 or Gpx3 were studied to assess the effects of these genes on selenium transfer to the neonate. Sepp1 knockout caused a drop in milk selenium to 27% of the value in wild-type milk and a drop in selenium acquisition by the neonates to 35%. In addition to decreasing milk selenium by eliminating Sepp1, deletion of Sepp1 causes a decline in whole-body selenium, which likely also contributes to the decreased transfer of selenium to the neonate. Deletion of Gpx3 did not decrease milk selenium content or neonate selenium acquisition by measurable amounts. Thus, when the dam is fed selenium-adequate diet (0.25 mg selenium/kg diet), milk Sepp1 transfers a large amount of selenium to neonates but the transfer of selenium by Gpx3 is below detection by our methods."
https://openalex.org/W2008884492,"Articular and growth plate cartilage are discrete tissues but arise from a common cartilaginous condensation and have comparable spatial architectures consisting of distinct layers of chondrocytes. To investigate similarities and differences between articular and growth plate cartilage and to explore transcriptional changes that occur during the onset of their divergence, we performed manual microdissection of 10-day-old rat proximal tibias, microarray analysis, bioinformatics, and real-time PCR to compare gene expression profiles in individual cartilage layers. We found that many genes that were spatially upregulated in the intermediate/deep zone of articular cartilage were also spatially upregulated in the resting zone of growth plate cartilage (overlap greater than expected by chance, P<0.001). Interestingly, the superficial zone of articular cartilage showed an expression profile with similarities to both the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of growth plate cartilage (P<0.001 each). Additionally, significant numbers of known proliferative zone markers (3 out of 6) and hypertrophic zone markers (27 out of 126) were spatially upregulated in the superficial zone (more than expected by chance, P<0.001 each). In conclusion, we provide evidence that the intermediate/deep zone of articular cartilage has a gene expression profile more similar to that of the resting zone of growth plate cartilage, whereas the superficial zone has a gene expression profile more similar to those of the proliferative and hypertrophic zones. These findings suggest that the superficial zone chondrocytes of articular cartilage differentiate according to a program that is not completely different from but instead has distinct similarities to the hypertrophic differentiation program of growth plate chondrocytes. We also present functional signaling pathways implicated by differential gene expression between articular and growth plate cartilage during their initial separation by the secondary ossification center."

However, the origin of miRNA-34a and its possible relationship with hemodynamics and outcome in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension is unknown. We analyzed the levels of miRNA-34a in cirrhotic patients with severe portal hypertension.We included 60 cirrhotic patients receiving TIPS for prevention of rebleeding and/or therapy-refractory ascites. miRNA-34a levels were measured using qPCR and normalized by SV-40 in the portal and hepatic venous blood of these patients taken at TIPS procedure. Hemodynamic and clinical parameters were assessed before TIPS and during follow-up.Levels of miRNA-34a were higher in the hepatic vein than in the portal vein. Circulating miRNA-34a in the hepatic vein correlated with ALT, CHE and sodium excretion after TIPS. miRNA-34a showed no correlation with portal pressure, but its levels in the portal vein correlated inversely with the congestion index. Interestingly, the levels of miRNA-34a in the portal and hepatic vein showed inverse correlation with arterial pressure. Furthermore, levels of miRNA-34a in the hepatic vein had a predictive value for survival, but MELD, creatinine at short-time follow-up 14 days after TIPS-insertion and portal pressure after TIPS performed better.This study demonstrates for the first time, that miRNA-34a may originate to a large extent from the liver. Even though higher levels of miRNA-34a are possibly associated with better survival at long-term follow-up in cirrhotic patients with severe portal hypertension receiving TIPS, classical prognostic parameters predict the survival better."
https://openalex.org/W2158763418,"Hysteresis and bet-hedging (random choice of phenotypes) are two different observations typically linked with multiplicity of phenotypes in biological systems. Hysteresis can be viewed as form of the system's persistent memory of past environmental conditions, while bet-hedging is a diversification strategy not necessarily associated with any memory. It has been shown that bet-hedging can increase population growth when phenotype adjusts its switching probability in response to environmental inputs. Although memory and hysteresis have been used to generate environment dependent phenotype switching probabilities, their exact connection to bet-hedging have remained unclear. In this work, using a simple model that takes into account phenotype switching as well as lag phase in the population growth occurring after the phenotype switching, it is shown that memory and hysteresis emerge naturally and are firmly linked to bet-hedging as organisms attempt to optimize their population growth rate. The optimal ``magnitude'' of hysteresis is explained to be associated with stochastic resonance where the characteristic time between subsequent phenotype switching events is linked to the lag phase delay. Furthermore, hysteretic switching strategy is shown not to confer any additional population growth advantage if the environment varies periodically in a deterministic fashion. This suggests that, while bet-hedging may evolve under some conditions even in deterministic environments, memory and hysteresis is probably the result of environmental uncertainty in the presence of lag phase in the switching of phenotypes."

The results showed that the four strains caused disease and death of the scale insect, among which the L. lecanii strains V3.4504 and V3.4505 displayed stronger virulence than the F. incarnatum-equiseti strains HEB01 and L. fungicola strain HEB02 to M. matsumurae in the 2nd-instar nymphs and the adult females. Furthermore, L. lecanii V3.4505 was most virulent to M. matsumurae. The adult females and the male 3rd-instar nymphs of M. matsumurae were susceptible to L. lecanii V3.4505; the adult females were more susceptible at LT50 = 1.96 than the 3rd-instar nymphs at LT50 = 5.67. The body surface structure, cuticle thickness and wax secretions of M. matsumurae impacted the fungal infection. L. lecanii is a promising biocontrol agent, and newly emerged male 3rd-instar nymphs and adult females are a crucial period of the insect's life cycle for M. matsumurae biocontrol."
https://openalex.org/W2076934751,"In the Drosophila oogenesis, germline stem cells (GSCs) continuously self-renew and differentiate into daughter cells for consecutive germline lineage commitment. This developmental process has become an in vivo working platform for studying adult stem cell fate regulation. An increasing number of studies have shown that while concerted actions of extrinsic signals from the niche and intrinsic regulatory machineries control GSC self-renewal and germline differentiation, epigenetic regulation is implicated in the process. Here, we report that Brahma (Brm), the ATPase subunit of the Drosophila SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes, is required for maintaining GSC fate. Removal or knockdown of Brm function in either germline or niche cells causes a GSC loss, but does not disrupt normal germline differentiation within the germarium evidenced at the molecular and morphological levels. There are two Drosophila SWI/SNF complexes: the Brm-associated protein (BAP) complex and the polybromo-containing BAP (PBAP) complex. More genetic studies reveal that mutations in polybromo/bap180, rather than gene encoding Osa, the BAP complex-specific subunit, elicit a defect in GSC maintenance reminiscent of the brm mutant phenotype. Further genetic interaction test suggests a functional association between brm and polybromo in controlling GSC self-renewal. Taken together, studies in this paper provide the first demonstration that Brm in the form of the PBAP complex functions in the GSC fate regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2085900850,"Objectives To determine the in vitro activity of antibiotics, including arbekacin, cefminox, fosfomycin and biapenem which are all still unavailable in India, against Gram-negative clinical isolates. Methods We prospectively collected and tested all consecutive isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. from blood, urine and sputum samples between March and November 2012. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 16 antibiotics was determined by the broth micro-dilution method. Results Overall 925 isolates were included; 211 E. coli, 207 Klebsiella spp., 153 P. aeruginosa, and 354 Acinetobacter spp. The MIC50 and MIC90 were high for cefminox, biapenem and arbekacin for all pathogens but interpretative criteria were not available. The MIC50 was categorized as susceptible for a couple of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems and amikacin, for E. coli, Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa. However, for Acinetobacter spp., the MIC50 was categorized as susceptible only for colistin. On the other hand, fosfomycin was the only antibiotic that inhibited 90% of E. coli and Klebsiella spp. isolates, while 90% of P. aeruginosa isolates were inhibited only by colistin. Finally, 90% of Acinetobacter spp. isolates were not inhibited by any antibiotic tested. Conclusion Fosfomycin and colistin might be promising antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to E. coli or Klebsiella spp. and P. aeruginosa, respectively, in India; however, clinical trials should first corroborate the in vitro findings. The activity of tigecycline should be evaluated, as this is commonly used as last-resort option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections."

However, long-term survival remains limited because of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Soluble HLA-G, a mediator of adaptive immunity that modulates regulatory T cells and certain classes of effector T cells, may be a useful marker of survival free of BOS. We conducted a retrospective, single-center, pilot review of 38 lung transplant recipients who underwent collection of serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 3, 6 and 12 months after transplantation, and compared soluble HLA-G concentrations in each to the presence of type A rejection and lymphocytic bronchiolitis in the first 12 months and to the presence of BOS at 24 months after transplantation. Lung soluble HLA-G concentrations were directly related to the presence of type A rejection but not to lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Our data demonstrate that soluble HLA-G concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage but not in serum correlates with the number of acute rejection episodes in the first 12 months after lung transplantation, and thus may be a reactive marker of rejection."

PET parameters including maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max), mean standardized uptake value (SUV mean), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glucose (TLG) of both primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes were calculated. Total SUV max were recorded as the sum of SUV max of primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes. Total SUV mean, Total MTV and Total TLG were calculated in the same way as Total SUV max.The median follow-up was 32 months (range, 23-68 months). Distant metastasis was the main pattern of treatment failure. Univariate analysis showed higher SUV max, SUV mean, MTV, and TLG of primary tumor, Total SUV max, Total MTV, Total TLG, and stage T3-4 were factors predicting for significantly poorer distant metastasis-free survival (p = 0.042, p = 0.008, p = 0.023, p = 0.023, p = 0.024, p = 0.033, p = 0.016, p = 0.015). In multivariate analysis, Total SUV max was the independent predictive factor for distant metastasis (p = 0.046).

However, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni2+-NTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. The recombinantly expressed Scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R.

Investigations of this drug in the treatment of cocaine and nicotine dependence in addition to disorders of executive function are also underway. Modafinil has been known to increase glutamate levels in rat brain models. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1HMRS) has been commonly used to detect the glutamate (Glu) changes in vivo. In this study, we used a recently described glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) imaging technique to measure Modafinil induced regional Glu changes in rat brain and compared the results with Glu concentration measured by single voxel 1HMRS. No increases in either GluCEST maps or 1HMRS were observed after Modafinil injection over a period of 5 hours. However, a significant increase in GluCEST (19±4.4%) was observed 24 hours post Modafinil administration, which is consistent with results from previous biochemical studies. This change was not consistently seen with 1HMRS. GluCEST mapping allows regional cerebral Glu changes to be measured and may provide a useful clinical biomarker of Modafinil effects for the management of patients with sleep disorders and addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2033235415,"Human (α6β2)(α4β2)β3 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are essential for addiction to nicotine and a target for drug development for smoking cessation. Expressing this complex AChR is difficult, but has been achieved using subunit concatamers. In order to determine what limits expression of α6* AChRs and to efficiently express α6* AChRs using free subunits, we investigated expression of the simpler (α6β2)2β3 AChR. The concatameric form of this AChR assembles well, but is transported to the cell surface inefficiently. Various chimeras of α6 with the closely related α3 subunit increased expression efficiency with free subunits and produced pharmacologically equivalent functional AChRs. A chimera in which the large cytoplasmic domain of α6 was replaced with that of α3 increased assembly with β2 subunits and transport of AChRs to the oocyte surface. Another chimera replacing the unique methionine 211 of α6 with leucine found at this position in transmembrane domain 1 of α3 and other α subunits increased assembly of mature subunits containing β3 subunits within oocytes. Combining both α3 sequences in an α6 chimera increased expression of functional (α6β2)2β3 AChRs to 12-fold more than with concatamers. This is pragmatically useful, and provides insights on features of α6 subunit structure that limit its expression in transfected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071882769,"It has been known for some time that there are many weakly expressed and fast-evolving microRNAs (miRNAs)1-6. After analyzing more than 100,000 reads of small RNAs obtained from Drosophila heads, we suggested that most of these miRNAs were born and then died with the evolutionary dynamics of neutrally evolving sequences7. The birth and death rates of miRNAs were estimated to be about 12 and 11.7 genes per Myr, respectively, resulting in a fairly modest net gain of only 0.3 genes per Myr.

Berezikov et al. revised the estimate of net gain to be about 1 gene per Myr but did not provide an estimate of the birth and death rates separately8. Instead, they argued that our estimates for both the birth and death rates were too high by claiming that many of the miRNAs in our analysis were not miRNAs at all but were merely degraded products of mRNAs.

Their main concern was that many of the newly born miRNAs in our observation were singletons. In their expanded data, many of these singletons were missing and some were accompanied by sequences of similar length in the same hairpin, both of which suggested RNA degradation. Being mindful of the limitation of low coverage in our study7, we have collected 18 million small RNA reads in Drosophila heads by sequencing of oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD) sequencing. We analyzed only reads that appeared at least 50 times in the arm of a hairpin and for which the accurate processing rate of the 5′ end of the miRNAs was ≥90%. The new dataset shows that the conclusion of Lu et al.7 was not biased by low coverage, as suggested by Berezikov et al.8.

What, then, may be the reasons for the discrepancy between the analysis of Berezikov et al.8 and our analysis7? Due to space limitations, we shall only give a brief account and will present a more thorough comparison on our website (http://pondside.uchicago.edu/wulab/microRNA/).

First, Berezikov et al.8 defined miRNAs much more narrowly than we believe is reasonable. They did not consider hairpins on exons—a legitimate source of miRNAs, as many known miRNAs share sequences with exons9-11. In addition, they used criteria derived from conserved miRNAs to screen out candidates. These criteria include a much lower rate of evolution in the arms of the hairpin than in the loop and also the narrow size distribution of mature miRNAs. If miRNAs are defined by conservation, then there would be few that are evolutionarily transient.

Second, different sequencing platforms are known to yield fairly different results2,12. By sequencing platform, we mean more than just sequencing chemistry; rather, we include the entire protocols, from upstream library preparation to base callings, recommended by the manufacturers of Roche 454 GS-FLX, IlluminaGA or SOLiD-ABI DNA sequencers. Lu et al.7, Berezikov et al.8 and our new study (unpublished) used the 454, GA and SOLiD methods, respectively. Even the most abundant miRNAs were recorded with surprisingly large disparity by different methods, and the rare miRNAs were not detected by all methods. Our SOLiD datasets indeed contain many genes with multiple reads that were absent in the GA data Berezikov et al. used8. In another accompanying paper (Zhou et al., unpublished), we show that GA and SOLiD sequencing also perform very differently in SNP detection.

Third, Berezikov et al.8 incorrectly used the argument of proportionality, which further confounded the interpretation of rare miRNAs. When there exists a large number of weakly expressed genes, a tenfold increase in coverage might increase the observed number of all rare genes tenfold, but each new gene discovery is likely to be different from the previously observed ones13. The same rare genes should not be expected to occur ten times as often, as Berezikov et al. asserted8.

Fourth, the variation in miRNA expression within the same species should not be ignored. In humans, with GA sequencing, we have observed 300 conserved miRNAs that could be detected in fewer than 6 of the 12 human kidney libraries (Lu et al., unpublished data). Because the level of genetic variation in D. melanogaster is 20 times greater than that in humans, we expect the level of miRNA expression polymorphism to be at least as large. Berezikov et al.8 and Lu et al.7 used different fly strains in their surveys.

The account above shows that low-frequency small RNAs (including miRNAs) are often seen in some studies (such as Lu et al.7 and our new SOLiD data) but not others (such as Berezikov et al.8). The hasty conclusion that RNA degradation must be at issue seems inappropriate.

Finally, we believe that the debate should shift to the rate of net gene gain (birth rate – death rate). After all, there is no disagreement about the conclusion that the transient genes, miRNAs or not, do not appear to be biologically important. We suspect that our original estimate of 0.3 genes per Myr7 might be an underestimate. Because of the moderate number of reads from a single platform (454), many miRNAs were not observed or were observed in one species only. As a result, birth rate might have been underestimated and death rate overestimated. We will provide a revised estimate on the basis of the new and expanded dataset elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W1975580247,"Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an enzyme of 30 kDa grouped in the kallikrein family is synthesized to high levels by normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. Therefore, it is the main biomarker currently used for early diagnosis of prostate cancer. Here, presteady-state and steady-state kinetics of the PSA-catalyzed hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate Mu-His-Ser-Ser-Lys-Leu-Gln-AMC (spanning from pH 6.5 to pH 9.0, at 37.0°C) are reported. Steady-state kinetics display at every pH value a peculiar feature, represented by an initial “burst” phase of the fluorescence signal before steady-state conditions are taking place. This behavior, which has been already observed in other members of the kallikrein family, suggests the occurrence of a proteolytic mechanism wherefore the acylation step is faster than the deacylation process. This feature allows to detect the acyl intermediate, where the newly formed C-terminal carboxylic acid of the cleaved substrate forms an ester bond with the -OH group of the Ser195 catalytic residue, whereas the AMC product has been already released. Therefore, the pH-dependence of the two enzymatic steps (i.e., acylation and deacylation) has been separately characterized, allowing the determination of pKa values. On this basis, possible residues are tentatively identified in PSA, which might regulate these two steps by interacting with the two portions of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2062054448,"The molecular mechanism that regulates epicardial development has yet to be understood. In this study, we explored the function of CDX1, a Caudal-related family member, in epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and in the migration and the differentiation of epicardium-derived progenitors into vascular smooth muscle cells. We detected a transient expression of CDX1 in murine embryonic hearts at 11.5 days post coitum (dpc). Using a doxycycline-inducible CDX1 mouse model, primary epicardium, and ex vivo heart culture, we further demonstrated that ectopic expression of CDX1 promoted epicardial EMT. In addition, a low-dose CDX1 induction led to enhanced migration and differentiation of epicardium-derived cells into α-SMA+ vascular smooth muscles. In contrast, either continued high-level induction of CDX1 or CDX1 deficiency attenuated the ability of epicardium-derived cells to migrate and to mature into smooth muscles induced by TGF-β1. Further RNA-seq analyses showed that CDX1 induction altered the transcript levels of genes involved in neuronal development, angiogenesis, and cell adhesions required for EMT. Our data have revealed a previously undefined role of CDX1 during epicardial development, and suggest that transient expression of CDX1 promotes epicardial EMT, whereas subsequent down-regulation of CDX1 after 11.5 dpc in mice is necessary for further subepicardial invasion of EPDCs and contribution to coronary vascular endothelium or smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2010214917,"Objective The controversy that iodized salt may increase the risk of thyroid disorders has been aroused in China during the past decade. Most of studies focused on adult rather than children. We aimed to explore whether iodized salt was associated with an increased risk of thyroid nodule in Chinese children. Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted in Hangzhou, China, in 2010. Iodized salt intake, urine iodine concentration (UIC) and thyroid nodule (by ultrasonography) were measured in 3026 children. The associations of iodized salt with thyroid nodule were evaluated using multiple logistic regression models. Results The prevalence of thyroid nodule was 10.59% among Chinese children. Girls (11.89%) had higher prevalence of thyroid nodule than boys (9.26%). No significant association was observed between type of salt and thyroid nodule in pooled samples, boys and girls, respectively. Similar associations were observed between UIC and thyroid nodule. There was no significant association between milk consumption and thyroid nodule as well. Conclusion The present study indicated that non-iodized salt may not increase the risk of thyroid nodules among Chinese children. Similar associations were observed between milk consumption, UIC and thyroid nodules."
https://openalex.org/W2129126941,"Nanocrystalline mixed metal oxides (MMO) of various metal cations were synthesized and were used for coating a piece of copper wire as a new high sensitive solid phase micro extraction (SPME) fiber in extraction and determination of BTEX compounds from the headspace of aqueous samples prior to GC-FID analysis. Under optimum extraction conditions, the proposed fiber exhibited low detection limits, and quantification limits, good reproducibility, simple and fast preparation method, high fiber capacity and high thermal and mechanical durability. These are some of the most important advantages of the new fiber. The proposed fiber was used for human hemoglobin upon interaction with benzene. Binding isotherm, Scatchard and Klotz logarithmic plots were constructed using HS-SPME-GC data, accurately. The obtained binding isotherm analyzed using Hill method. The Hill parameters have been obtained by calculating saturation parameter from the ratio of measured chromatographic peak areas in the presence and absence of hemoglobin. In this interaction, Hill coefficient and Hill constant determined as (nH = 6.14 and log KH = 6.47) respectively. These results reveal the cooperativity of hemoglobin upon interaction with benzene."
https://openalex.org/W2096695714,"Volumes of data used in science and industry are growing rapidly. When researchers face the challenge of analyzing them, their format is often the first obstacle. Lack of standardized ways of exploring different data layouts requires an effort each time to solve the problem from scratch. Possibility to access data in a rich, uniform manner, e.g. using Structured Query Language (SQL) would offer expressiveness and user-friendliness. Comma-separated values (CSV) are one of the most common data storage formats. Despite its simplicity, with growing file size handling it becomes non-trivial. Importing CSVs into existing databases is time-consuming and troublesome, or even impossible if its horizontal dimension reaches thousands of columns. Most databases are optimized for handling large number of rows rather than columns, therefore, performance for datasets with non-typical layouts is often unacceptable. Other challenges include schema creation, updates and repeated data imports. To address the above-mentioned problems, I present a system for accessing very large CSV-based datasets by means of SQL. It's characterized by: “no copy” approach – data stay mostly in the CSV files; “zero configuration” – no need to specify database schema; written in C++, with boost [1], SQLite [2] and Qt [3], doesn't require installation and has very small size; query rewriting, dynamic creation of indices for appropriate columns and static data retrieval directly from CSV files ensure efficient plan execution; effortless support for millions of columns; due to per-value typing, using mixed text/numbers data is easy; very simple network protocol provides efficient interface for MATLAB and reduces implementation time for other languages. The software is available as freeware along with educational videos on its website [4]. It doesn't need any prerequisites to run, as all of the libraries are included in the distribution package. I test it against existing database solutions using a battery of benchmarks and discuss the results."
