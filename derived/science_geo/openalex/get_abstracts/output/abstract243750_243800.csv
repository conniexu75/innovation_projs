Our investigation represents an exploration of the effect of alarm pheromone on avoidance conditioning. Fifteen 2 inch goldfish, Carassius auratus, were kept in a thirty gallon aquarium divided into thirds by wire barriers. In accordance with other reports, the fish were deliberately well fed2. Massed avoidance conditioning (all trials on one day) was studied in a Lafayette Instrument aquatic conditioning unit (volume of approximately one gallon; inside dimensions, 3.5×6×9 inches). Lights at each end of the conditioning tank served as the conditional stimuli (CS) and electric shock as the unconditional stimulus (US). Shock was adjusted for each fish and varied from 5 to 7 a.c."
