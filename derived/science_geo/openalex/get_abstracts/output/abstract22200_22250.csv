https://openalex.org/W1537712767,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an apparently endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is structurally related to platelet-derived growth factor. By Northern blot and protein analyses, we show that VEGF is produced by cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. Analysis of VEGF transcripts in these cells by polymerase chain reaction and cDNA cloning revealed three different forms of the VEGF coding region, as had been reported in HL60 cells. The three forms of the human VEGF protein chain predicted from these coding regions are 189, 165, and 121 amino acids in length. Comparison of cDNA nucleotide sequences with sequences derived from human VEGF genomic clones indicates that the VEGF gene is split among eight exons and that the various VEGF coding region forms arise from this gene by alternative splicing: the 165-amino-acid form of the protein is missing the residues encoded by exon 6, whereas the 121-amino-acid form is missing the residues encoded by exons 6 and 7. Analysis of the VEGF gene promoter region revealed a single major transcription start, which lies near a cluster of potential Sp1 factor binding sites. The promoter region also contains several potential binding sites for the transcription factors AP-1 and AP-2; consistent with the presence of these sites, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that the level of VEGF transcripts is elevated in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells after treatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2138993111,"Hematopoietic stem cells show reduced staining with a mitochondrial fluorescent dye, rhodamine 123 (Rh-123), which was supposed to indicate decreased mitochondrial activity in these cells. Rh123 and several other fluorescent dyes are substrates for transport mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump responsible for multidrug resistance in tumor cells. We have found that staining of human bone marrow cells with fluorescent dyes is potentiated by P-gp inhibitors and inversely correlated with P-gp expression. P-gp is expressed in practically all hematopoietic progenitor cells, including long-term culture-initiating cells. The highest levels of P-gp among the progenitors are associated with cells displaying characteristics of pluripotent stem cells. These results have implications for stem cell purification and bone marrow resistance to cancer chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2009747268,"The posterior group gene staufen is required both for the localization of maternal determinants to the posterior pole of the Drosophila egg and for bicoid RNA to localize correctly to the anterior pole. We report the cloning and sequencing of staufen and show that staufen protein is one of the first molecules to localize to the posterior pole of the oocyte, perhaps in association with oskar RNA. Once localized, staufen is found in the polar granules and is required to hold other polar granule components at the posterior pole. By the time the egg is laid, staufen protein is also concentrated at the anterior pole, in the same region as bicoid RNA."

https://openalex.org/W2002534697,"When trypomastigotes of T. cruzi emerge from cells of the mammalian host, they contain little or no sialic acids on their surfaces. However, rapidly upon entering the circulation, they express a unique cell surface trans-sialidase activity. This enzyme specifically transfers alpha (2-3)-linked sialic acid from extrinsic host-derived macromolecules to parasite surface molecules, leading to the assembly of Ssp-3, a trypomastigote-specific epitope. The T. cruzi trans-sialidase does not utilize cytidine 5' monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid as a donor substrate, but readily transfers sialic acid from exogenously supplied alpha (2-3)-sialyllactose. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize sialic acid residues of Ssp-3 inhibit attachment of trypomastigotes to host cells, suggesting that the unusual trans-sialidase provides Ssp-3 with structural features required for target cell recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2085193833,BCR-ABL is a chimeric oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive human leukemias. BCR first exon sequences specifically activate the tyrosine kinase and transforming potential of BCR-ABL. We have tested the hypothesis that activation of BCR-ABL may involve direct interaction between BCR sequences and the tyrosine kinase regulatory domains of ABL. Full-length c-BCR as well as BCR sequences retained in BCR-ABL bind specifically to the SH2 domain of ABL. The binding domain has been localized within the first exon of BCR and consists of at least two SH2-binding sites. This domain is essential for BCR-ABL-mediated transformation. Phosphoserine/phosphothreonine but not phosphotyrosine residues on BCR are required for interaction with the ABL SH2 domain. These findings extend the range of potential SH2-protein interactions in growth control pathways and suggest a function for SH2 domains in the activation of the BCR-ABL oncogene as well as a role for BCR in cellular signaling pathways.
https://openalex.org/W2072614922,"Expression of brain mRNA or cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes was used to determine what subunits of the GABAA receptor are required for modulation by barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and ethanol. Mouse brain mRNA was hybridized with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to sequences unique to specific subunits and injected into oocytes. Antisense oligonucleotides to the alpha 1, beta 1, gamma 1, gamma 2S + 2L, gamma 2L, or gamma 3 subunits did not alter GABA action or enhancement by pentobarbital. Action of diazepam was prevented by antisense oligonucleotides to gamma 2S + 2L and reduced by antisense sequences to gamma 2L, but was not affected by the other oligonucleotides. Ethanol enhancement of GABA action was prevented only by antisense oligonucleotides to gamma 2L (which differs from gamma 2S by the addition of 8 amino acids). Expression of either the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2S or the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L subunit cRNA combination in oocytes resulted in GABA responses that were enhanced by diazepam or pentobarbital, but only the combination containing the gamma 2L subunit was affected by ethanol."

https://openalex.org/W1980008415,"Peptide growth factors have been shown to have diverse effects on cells of the CNS, such as promoting neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth, and several other aspects of neuronal differentiation. In addition, some of these factors have been shown to be mitogenic for particular classes of glial cells within the brain and optic nerve, and recently two peptide growth factors, fibroblast growth factor and nerve growth factor, have been shown to have mitogenic activity on the CNS neuronal progenitors. We now report that two members of another peptide growth factor, epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-α, are mitogenic for retinal neuroepithelial cells in primary cultures and provide evidence for the presence of both of these factors in normal developing rat retina."
https://openalex.org/W2016828215,"Agrin causes acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on chick myotubes in culture to aggregate, forming specializations that resemble the postsynaptic apparatus at the vertebrate skeletal neuromuscular junction. Here we report that treating chick myotubes with agrin caused an increase in phosphorylation of the AChR beta, gamma, and delta subunits. H-7, a potent inhibitor of several protein serine kinases, blocked agrin-induced phosphorylation of the gamma and delta subunits, but did not prevent either agrin-induced AChR aggregation or phosphorylation of the beta subunit. Experiments with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that agrin caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunit that began within 30 min of adding agrin to the myotube cultures, reached a plateau by 3 hr, and was blocked by treatments known to block agrin-induced AChR aggregation. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies labeled agrin-induced specializations as they do the postsynaptic apparatus. These results suggest that agrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the beta subunit may play a role in regulating AChR distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2142575579,"Abstract Nitric oxide (NO) synthase (EC 1.14.23) has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat macrophages. The purification procedure involves affinity chromatography with adenosine 2',5'-diphosphate-agarose and gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. The apparent molecular weight is 300,000 by gel filtration. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, the enzyme migrates as a single protein band with Mr = 150,000. The purified enzyme is colorless, and an absorption maximum is observed at 280 nm. The half-life of the enzyme activity is 6 h at pH 7.4 and 4 degrees C. The enzyme activity required the presence of NADPH, (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-L-biopterin, and dithiothreitol. Although the cerebellar and endothelial enzyme require Ca2+ and calmodulin, these are not required by the macrophage enzyme. The macrophage nitric oxide synthase (an inducible enzyme) seems to be different from the cerebellar and endothelial enzyme (a constitutive enzyme)."
https://openalex.org/W1998235437,"cDNAs encoding a novel member of the cadherin cell adhesion receptor family were cloned. This cadherin is expressed in the retina of the chicken and is termed R-cadherin. It is similar to other cadherins in its primary structure, but most resembles N-cadherin, showing 74% amino acid identity. Cells expressing R-cadherin can adhere to those expressing N-cadherin when mixed, but they form homotypic clusters within their chimeric aggregates. In the development of the neural retina, R-cadherin begins to be expressed around embryonic day 8 in both neuronal and glial cells, and this expression continues up to the hatching stage. The pattern of the expression of R-cadherin was different from that of N-cadherin, suggesting distinctive roles in retinal morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1964706228,"We show that the rate of degradation of RNAI, an anti-sense repressor of the replication primer RNAII, is a key element of control in the replication of ColE1-type plasmids in vivo. Cleavage of RNAI by RNAase E, a ribosomal RNA-processing enzyme encoded or controlled by the rne (also known as ams) locus, relieves repression by endonucleolytically converting RNAI to a very rapidly decaying product, pRNAI-5. A 5' triphosphate-terminated homolog of pRNAI-5 is degraded slowly and consequently inhibits replication. Nucleotide substitutions within the RNAase E cleavage sequence alter RNAI half-life and plasmid copy number, changing also the incompatibility phenotype. RNAI variants lacking the sequence cleaved by RNAase E are eliminated by growth rate-dependent degradation, resulting in growth-responsive control of plasmid replication and copy number."
https://openalex.org/W2090830599,"Since trophic factors are increasingly recognized as playing a role in some decision-making steps during development, the influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) on the commitment of pluripotent neural crest cells was investigated by in vitro clonal analysis. BDNF caused an increase of up to 21-fold in the number of sensory neuron precursors per colony without a corresponding increase in the total number of cells. By contrast, BDNF treatment caused an equivalent decrease in the number of undifferentiated cells per colony. The data suggest that BDNF, but not NGF, directs pluripotent neural crest cells to differentiate along the primary sensory neuron lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1608138774,"The purpose of this investigation was to characterize the reaction of alpha 2-antiplasmin (alpha 2AP) and alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) with human plasmin bound to rat C6 glioma cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Binding of plasmin (0.1 microM) to C6 cells at 4 degrees C did not cause cell detachment, decrease viability or change cell morphology. The KD and Bmax for the binding of diisopropyl phosphoryl plasmin (DIP-plasmin) to C6 cells were 0.9 microM and 2.6 x 10(6) sites/cell. The dissociation rate constants (koff) for 125I-plasmin were 9.7 x 10(-4) and 4.0 x 10(-4) s-1 at 4 degrees C in the presence and absence of 0.3 microM DIP-plasmin, respectively. Similar constants were determined for 125I-plasminogen and 125I-DIP-plasmin. Neither alpha 2AP nor alpha 2M affected the dissociation of DIP-plasmin. C6 cell-associated 125I-plasmin reacted slowly with alpha 2AP; however, the inhibition rate constants exceeded the koff. alpha 2AP-plasmin complex formed after the plasmin dissociated into solution (reaction pathway 1) and by direct reaction of alpha 2AP with cell-associated enzyme (reaction pathway 2). High concentrations of alpha 2AP favored pathway 2. C6 cell-associated plasmin was also protected from inhibition by alpha 2M. While the same pathways were probably involved in this reaction, alpha 2M was less effective than alpha 2AP as an inhibitor of nondissociated plasmin (pathway 2). When C6 cell-bound plasmin reacted with alpha 2AP, alpha 2AP-plasmin complex was recovered primarily in the medium, suggesting dissociation of complexes formed on the cell surface. Plasmin-receptor dissociation and inhibition experiments were performed at 22 degrees and 37 degrees C, confirming the conclusions of the 4 degrees C studies. Comparable results were also obtained using HUVEC cultures. These studies demonstrate that cell-associated plasmin is protected from inhibition by alpha 2M as well as alpha 2AP. At least two reaction pathways may be demonstrated for the inhibition of plasmin that is initially receptor-bound; however, neither pathway is highly effective, accounting for the plasmin-protective activity of the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1545863889,"Upon stimulation with antigen or antibodies directed at the CD3.T cell receptor complex, T lymphocytes undergo a series of biochemical events that result in DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. The purpose of the current study was to explore the role of mevalonic acid and its metabolites in this process. Stimulation of freshly isolated human T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) results in the induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase message, with maximum induction occurring at 24 h of culture, approximately 12 h before the onset of DNA synthesis. Protein kinase C (PKC) probably mediates this induction, as H7, which inhibits PKC and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases, but not HA1004, which inhibits all of these protein kinases except PKC, completely abrogates the appearance of HMG-CoA reductase message. The importance of HMG-CoA reductase induction and mevalonate production in cell cycle progression was demonstrated by the observation that either 25-hydroxycholesterol, which inhibits this induction, or lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibited anti-CD3-induced T cell mitogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The presence of lovastatin during the first 24-36 h of culture results in a progressive delay of cell cycle progression, whereas this agent, when present only for the first 12 h of culture, had no effect on T cell proliferation. These results suggest that mevalonate is required for cell cycle progression from mid-G1 into late G1. Exogenous mevalonate overcomes the antiproliferative effect of lovastatin but not of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Since 25-hydroxycholesterol suppresses the metabolism of mevalonic acid at multiple points, this result suggests that one or more metabolites of mevalonate, rather than mevalonate itself, plays an essential role in cell cycle progression. One metabolite of mevalonate, farnesol pyrophosphate, may play such a role, since free farnesol suppresses anti-CD3 mAb-induced T cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. In mAb is associated with PKC-dependent induction of HMG-CoA reductase which, in turn, leads to the generation of mevalonic acid and its metabolites, one or more of which play a requisite role in cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1971933857,"Microtubule-associated protein 1 B (MAP1B), an abundant developmentally regulated neuronal protein, is a stoichiometric complex of a heavy chain and two light chains (light chain 1 and light chain 3). We find that light chain 1 is encoded within the 3′ end of a previously reported MAP1 B heavy chain cDNA Amino acid sequencing, epitope mapping, Northern blotting, and Southern blotting indicate that the light chain and heavy chain are encoded by the same mRNA within the same open reading frame. In addition, amino acid sequencing of a 120 kd microtubule-binding and light chain-binding fragment of the heavy chain reveals that light chain 1 binds near the heavy chain N-terminus. Together these data indicate that the heavy chain and light chain 1 are produced by proteolytic processing of a MAP1B polyprotein and form a complex microtubule-binding domain."

https://openalex.org/W1675925507,"Cecropins A, B, and D are antibacterial peptides of 35-37 amino acids that are synthesized in pupae of the Cecropia moth (Hyalophora cecropia) as a response to a bacterial infection. cDNA cloning has shown that the cecropins are made as preproproteins that are processed in four steps to the mature peptides. We have now cloned the genes for preprocecropins A and D, data that together with earlier work on the B gene has made it possible to deduce the arrangement of the cecropin locus. The genes for the three cecropins are organized in a large cluster spanning 20 kilobases of DNA and for each gene there is one copy/haploid genome. The size of the cluster is in part due to long distances between the genes and to the presence of insertion elements in the introns of the A and D genes. The cecropin genes are not expressed in parallel. Transcripts for cecropins A and B appear within 2 h after injection of live bacteria, they reach a maximum after 48 h, and they are continuously expressed at this level for several days. The D gene has a delayed pattern of expression where transcripts appear within 48-96 h and reach a maximum after 144 h. In consonance is also the production of the mature cecropins A, B, and D where the active cecropins A and B are detected in the hemolymph within 10-24 h while the D form is not detected until 48 h post infection. Control injections with sterile saline produced only a weak induction of the cecropin genes."
https://openalex.org/W1604303666,"The predicted amino acid sequence of human complement receptor 2 (CR2, CD21, C3d,g/Epstein-Barr virus receptor) and its genetic murine homologue are approximately 70% identical. The sequence of each consists of a linear array of 60-70 amino acid repeats designated short consensus repeats (SCRs). Although they share significant sequence identity, a major difference in the activities of these two proteins has been believed to be the ability of human, but not mouse, CR2 to mediate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection of B lymphocytes. In order to formally address this question and to directly compare the activities of the CR2 protein of each species, we have expressed recombinant mouse CR2 (rMCR2) in a human K562 erythroleukemia cell line background. We have found that rMCR2 reacts with two previously described rat anti-MCR2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 7G6 and 7E9, but not mAb 8C12, which recognizes only mouse complement receptor 1. rMCR2 rosettes with erythrocytes bearing mouse and human C3d,g and binds glutaraldehyde cross-linked human C3d,g with a similar Kd as human CR2 (HCR2). rMCR2 does not bind EBV. By using this observation and constructing chimeras bearing portions of MCR2 on a HCR2 background, we have been able to define unique sequences in HCR2 SCRs 1 and 2 important in the interaction with both mAb OKB7, which blocks EBV binding and infection, and with EBV. In addition, by using blocking peptides derived from HCR2 sequence, we have identified a second distinct region in SCR2 important in EBV binding. Therefore, within the first two SCRs of HCR2 are multiple distinct sites of interaction with EBV and with mAb OKB7."
https://openalex.org/W1503290529,"We have previously reported that polypeptide growth factors had an anti-inflammatory effect by decreasing the cytokine-enhanced expression of factor B (FB), an activator of the alternative complement pathway, in human fibroblasts. To further characterize the role of cytokines and growth factors in the inflammatory/repair continuum, we have studied the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) on the expression of metalloproteinases/antiproteinases of the extracellular matrix in cultured human fibroblasts. Co-incubation of IL-1 and PDGF synergistically increased the expression of stromelysin and interstitial collagenase to 23-fold (for both proteins) over background, while PDGF decreased the IL-1-enhanced expression of FB by 82%. PDGF, but not IL-1, alone or in combination, increased the synthesis of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. RNA blot analysis indicated that the changes in protein synthesis were regulated at a pretranslational level. Cycloheximide treatment indicated that the effects of PDGF on the metalloproteinases/antiproteinases were not protein-dependent, in contrast to results obtained for FB. The effect of the three dimeric forms of PDGF (AA, AB, and BB) on the synthesis of metalloproteinases and FB was also analyzed. The effects were qualitatively similar for each of the dimeric forms; however, the BB and AB isoforms had considerably greater effects than PDGF-AA. It has been reported that the PDGF receptors found in human fibroblasts have higher binding affinity for the BB and AB isoforms of the growth factor. The results presented in this paper are in accord with the possibility that differences in the biological activity of the three isoforms of PDGF are due to differences in the number or affinity of the binding sites of the target cells, rather than to different activation pathways of the receptor. Thus, PDGF increased cytokine effects on metalloproteinases, while decreasing cytokine effects or complement activator FB. The net effect of these changes may be to decrease inflammation and enhance remodeling early in repair and to enhance matrix stability later in the repair process."
https://openalex.org/W1675921820,"Abstract Two cDNA clones termed H36-1 and H36-2 were isolated from a human liver cDNA library. Clone H36-1 appears to represent the recently isolated human serum proteins h37 and h42, which are two differently glycosylated forms of a protein antigenically related to human complement factor H. The H36-1 deduced protein sequence is 327 amino acid long and possesses a leader sequence. The secreted part of the protein is comprised of five tandem repeating units, termed short consensus repeats (SCRs). SCR 1 and 2 display high homology to the corresponding region of the recently isolated murine factor H-related cDNA clone 13G1. In contrast, the 3'-end of the H36-1 clone shows sequence homology to the 3'-end of human complement factor H. The second clone, H36-2, is nearly identical to H36-1. Within 1148 base pairs, where the two clones overlap, their nucleotide sequences differed at nine positions. One nucleotide exchange in the sequence of H36-2 which was located within SCR 1 creats a stop codon (TAA). Consequently, the corresponding mRNA cannot code for a functional protein, suggesting that this clone is a transcribed pseudogene. These two clones represent new human members of the family of proteins structurally related to complement factor H."
https://openalex.org/W1565934703,"cDNA clones that code for a pig and human flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) have been isolated. The full-length sequence of the human cDNAs revealed that they encode a polypeptide of 532 amino acid residues containing putative FAD- and NADP-binding sites. The deduced amino acid sequence has 88 and 86% identity, respectively, with the pig and rabbit hepatic forms of FMO, but is only 58% similar to the rabbit pulmonary FMO, and thus represents the human ortholog of the hepatic form of FMO. However, as this FMO is present in low abundance in human adult liver, the general term hepatic for this form of the enzyme is misleading, and thus we propose the name FMO1 to describe this human FMO and its mammalian orthologs. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that human FMO1 mRNA is more abundant in fetal than in adult liver, indicating that in man the enzyme is subject to developmental regulation. Southern blot hybridization of human genomic DNA suggests that the protein is encoded by a single gene, which has been designated FMO1 and mapped to chromosome 1."
https://openalex.org/W1568592934,"To determine the epitopic structure for an anti-GalNAc alpha-Ser(Thr) (anti-Tn) monoclonal antibody, MLS 128, asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin was digested with various proteases, and the digests were fractionated by immunoaffinity column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography. From the tryptic digest, a glycopeptide, GP-I, and five other glycopeptides, GP-1-5, were obtained as bound and unbound fractions, respectively, of the immunoaffinity column. By solid phase radioimmunoassaying, it was found that GP-I was strongly immunoreactive, whereas GP-1-5 were poorly immunoreactive. On treatment with V8 protease, GP-I was converted to two glycopeptides, one with poor reactivity and the other with intermediate reactivity. From the thermolysin digest, the smallest fragment, GP-II, was isolated, which was as strongly immunoreactive as GP-I. GP-II corresponded to a part of GP-I, its sequence being Leu-Ser*-Glu-Ser*-Thr*-Thr*-Gln-Leu-Pro-Gly, where asterisks denote amino acids to which an alpha-GalNAc residue is attached. Other anti-Tn monoclonal antibodies, NCC-LU-35 and CA 3239, showed essentially the same reactivity to these glycopeptides as MLS 128 did. The glycopeptides (GP-1-5), which exhibited poor immunoreactivity, contained various GalNAc-containing structures, such as GalNAc-Ser, GalNAc-Thr, GalNAc-Ser-(GalNAc)-Ser, and GalNAc-Thr-(GalNAc)-Thr. These results indicate that a glycopeptide including a cluster structure, Ser*-Thr*-Thr*, is an essential part of the epitope recognized by anti-Tn antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W1514019531,"Seven monoclonal antibodies were prepared against cytoskeletal components of rat intestinal brush borders. In the following paper (Chandler, J. S., Calnek, D., and Quaroni, A., J. Biol. Chem. 266, 11932-11938), three of them were shown to be specific for, respectively, keratin 8 (RK4), keratin 19 (RK7), and a newly identified type I keratin (keratin 21) (RK5). With these antibodies we have investigated the changes in keratin gene expression accompanying intestinal cell differentiation. Keratin 21 was detected exclusively in differentiated villus cells and in goblet, enteroendocrine, and Paneth cells in the crypts; in the proliferative crypt cells keratin 19 was predominant. Analysis of keratins expressed by cultured rat crypt cells (IEC cells) confirmed the absence of keratin 21 in undifferentiated intestinal cells. Changes in keratin's expression similar to those observed with cell differentiation in the adult intestinal mucosa were also demonstrated during early fetal intestinal development: the stratified epithelium present at 15-16 days of gestation contained predominantly keratin 19 with only a small amount of keratin 8; keratin 21 was first detected at 18-19 days of gestation, concomitant with the appearance of a well formed brush border and an apical cytoplasmic terminal web. These results suggest that keratin tonofilaments may play a role in the morphological and structural alterations accompanying intestinal cell differentiation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1501969488,"Abstract Growth activation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts leads to a rapid induction of vinculin and beta 1-integrin gene expression. Addition of serum, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or platelet-derived growth factor to serum-starved, density-arrested cells resulted in a rapid increase in vinculin and beta 1-integrin mRNA levels and a corresponding increase in vinculin synthesis. The increase in vinculin and beta 1-integrin mRNA expression by serum or EGF was not blocked by the inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide. The kinetics of induction of vinculin and beta 1-integrin mRNAs by EGF are different: vinculin mRNA levels reached a peak of expression 4-5-fold greater than that measured in quiescent cells by 2 h after addition of growth factor, whereas beta 1-integrin mRNA levels increased more slowly and to a lesser extent, reaching peaks of 2-3-fold induction at 5 h poststimulation. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by prolonged pretreatment of cells with phorbol 1,2-myristate 1,3-acetate had no effect on the ability of EGF or platelet-derived growth factor to activate vinculin or beta 1-integrin mRNA expression. Furthermore, direct activation of protein kinase C with 1,2-myristate 1,3-acetate did not induce the expression of vinculin or beta 1-integrin mRNA, but did activate c-fos expression. In vitro nuclear run-on transcription assays demonstrate a greater than 7-fold increase in vinculin and beta 1-integrin transcription at 40-60 min after addition of EGF when compared with levels in quiescent cells. This activation was rapid and transient, but appeared to occur later than the increase in c-fos and actin transcription. These results demonstrate that vinculin and beta 1-integrin, important components of the cell adhesion apparatus, are members of a group of immediate early growth-responsive genes, along with c-fos, c-myc, actin, and fibronectin. In addition, regulation of these cell adhesion genes occurs exclusively through a protein kinase C-independent pathway in serum-deprived, density-arrested Swiss 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593839117,"The 160,000-Da protein (pp 160) which is rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to insulin and thus is a putative participant in signaling from the insulin receptor has been purified to homogeneity from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Isolation of this protein was accomplished by chromatography on an immobilized monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine, followed by gel electrophoresis. Sufficient protein was obtained to allow the determination of the sequences of several peptides, which in turn enabled the development of anti-peptide antibodies that specifically recognize pp 160. Immunoblotting of 3T3-L1 adipocyte lysates, together with the purified pp 160 as a standard, indicate that an insulin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocyte possesses about 230,000 copies of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp160 and that this amount is approximately 25% of the total pp160 in the cell. The number of tyrosine-phosphorylated pp160s per cell is approximately the same as that of insulin receptor beta subunits. These results provide further evidence for a role of pp160 in insulin signaling. Moreover, the availability of purified protein and knowledge of peptide sequences will allow the elucidation of the structure and function of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1649153511,"Human phagocytic cells express receptors for bacterial N-formyl peptides (formyl peptide receptor or FPR) which mediate chemotaxis, degranulation, and the respiratory burst. Although cDNA encoding a human phagocyte formyl peptide-binding protein has been reported recently (Boulay, F., Tardif, M., Brouchon, L., and Vignais, P. (1990) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 168, 1103-1109), functional coupling to signal transduction processes was not demonstrated. We describe corresponding full-length cDNA clones and prove that they encode the calcium-mobilizing human formyl peptide receptor by demonstrating functional reconstitution in the Xenopus oocyte. We further demonstrate that in contrast to all other cloned guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G-protein) coupled receptors expressed in this system, microinjection of FPR transcripts is not sufficient to confer ligand responsiveness to the oocyte: co-injection of phagocyte RNA encoding a complementary human factor that is not the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G-proteins Gi1, Gi2 or Gi3 is also required. Whereas a 1.4-kilobase FPR transcript is expressed exclusively in differentiated phagocytic cells, the complementary factor activity localizes to a 3.5-kilobase RNA fraction and is expressed in both differentiated and undifferentiated myeloid cells as well as in liver. The deduced human FPR protein possesses seven hydrophobic putative membrane spanning segments, three sites for N-linked glycosylation, and a short 18-amino acid predicted third cytoplasmic loop. Surprisingly, the human FPR possesses only 28% amino acid identity with the rabbit FPR reported recently by Thomas and co-workers (Thomas, K. M., Pyun, H. Y., and Navarro, J. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20061-20065). Moreover, the rabbit FPR does not require a complementary factor for calcium mobilization in the oocyte. Structural alignment reveals at most 20% amino acid identity of the human FPR with other G-protein coupled receptors, indicating a common ancestral gene. Functional reconstitution of the recombinant FPR will now permit precise delineation of its functional and regulatory domains. Moreover, discovery of a complementary factor for oocyte expression of the human FPR establishes a novel approach to the qualification by ligand screening of cDNA encoding other suspected G-protein coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1491530768,"We describe a line of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, SRD-4 cells, that lacks acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and fails to synthesize cholesteryl esters when stimulated with 25-hydroxycholesterol or low density lipoprotein. The cells also have a partial defect in their ability to repress transcription of three sterol-regulated genes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, and the low density lipoprotein receptor. The cells were selected by mutagenesis followed by growth in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, which kills the parental cells by cholesterol depletion, owing to an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and a stimulation of cholesterol esterification. Treatment of parental cells with compound 58-035 (3-(decyldimethylsilyl)-N-[2-(4-methylphenyl)-1- phenylethyl]propanamide), an inhibitor of ACAT, abolished cholesterol esterification but did not reproduce the defect in gene repression seen in the SRD-4 cells, and it only partially reproduced the resistance to the killing effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol. We conclude that the SRD-4 cells most likely have two independent defects, one in ACAT and the other in a factor that mediates sterol-dependent transcriptional repression. The SRD-4 cells thus resemble a line of hamster cells previously isolated (Cadigan, K.M., Heider, J.G., and Chang, T.-Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 274-282), which has similar independent defects. The results raise the possibility that a partial resistance to sterol repression provides a growth advantage to cells that lack ACAT."
https://openalex.org/W1504064518,"To understand fifth complement component (C5) gene regulation, splicing, and C5 protein deficiency at the molecular level, the organization of the murine C5 gene was determined. The C5 structural gene is present as a single copy in the mouse genome as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. Accordingly, three cosmid clones were isolated from a genomic library that was prepared from mouse strain B10.D2/nSnJ. These clones overlapped and contained the structural gene encoding the complete C5 alpha-chain and 90% of the beta-chain. The 5'-flanking region of the C5 gene was obtained from a clone isolated from a genomic lambda-MOPC-41 library. Unique restriction fragments were prepared from the genomic clones and subcloned, and the exons were sequenced. All introns were sized by sequencing or Southern analysis. The C5 structural gene was found to be a highly interrupted gene of approximately 78 kilobases containing 42 exons and 41 introns. The exons ranged in length from 58 to 247 base pairs, with an average length of 131 base pairs. The introns ranged in size from 100 base pairs to 4 kilobases with an average length of 1.5 kilobases. The C5 alpha-chain was encoded by 49 kilobases containing 26 exons; the beta-chain was encoded by 29 kilobases containing 16 exons. The C5a coding sequence was split between two exons. All intron/exon junctions followed the normal consensus rule except at intron 35 in which the 5'-donor GT was substituted by GC. The 2-base-pair gene deletion and HindIII and PvuII restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with murine C5 deficiency were localized to exon 7, exon 16, and intron 20, respectively. Comparison of the intron-exon junctions of the murine C5, human C3, and mouse C4 genes indicated that these genes are nearly identical in structural organization. However, the rat alpha 2-macroglobulin gene showed only moderate genomic organizational similarity to the murine C5 gene. A major and a minor transcriptional initiation site in the C5 gene were identified by primer extensions and confirmed by RNase protection assays. Sequence analysis of the 5'-flanking region (760 base pairs) revealed a TATA-like and CAAT box upstream of the major transcriptional initiation site at positions -274 and -303, respectively, suggesting an atypical promoter. The 5'-flanking region also contained sequences identical with several cis-acting motifs known to bind the liver-specific nuclear protein LF-A1 and the nuclear protein NF-kappa B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Chem. 266, 11923-11931) we describe the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies to study cytokeratin distribution in rat intestinal epithelium. In the present paper we describe the use of three antikeratin monoclonal antibodies to identify and recovery cDNA clones expressing immunologically specific fusion proteins from a rat intestinal cDNA library. DNA sequence analysis identified each cDNA encoded epitope including the carboxyl-terminal portions of cytokeratins 8 and 19 (as cataloged by Moll, R., Franke, W.W., and Schiller, D.L. (1982) Cell 31, 11-24) recognized by antibodies RK4 and RK7, respectively. In addition, antibody RK5 was used to recover a cDNA clone (pRK5) encoding a portion of a 48-kDa keratin-related protein with unique tissue and cellular distribution, designated cytokeratin 21. Translation of cDNA-selected mRNAs yielded individual proteins which could be resolved and identified by their specific immunoreactivities. The pRK5 cDNA was used to recover a larger (approximately 1.3 kilobase pairs) cDNA clone (KB2) from an independent cDNA library for DNA sequence analysis and for the recovery of additional overlapping cDNA clones. The resulting cDNA sequence (1519 base pairs) contains the complete coding region of cytokeratin 21 (49,387 daltons). The predicted amino acid sequence of cytokeratin 21 confirms its identity as a novel type I cytokeratin expressed predominantly in the intestinal epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W1521713956,"Cultured skin fibroblasts from a proband with osteogenesis imperfecta were found to synthesize normal and shortened alpha 2(I) chains of type I procollagen. A cDNA library was prepared using mRNA isolated from the proband's fibroblasts. Partial nucleotide sequencing of five clones demonstrated that two clones lacked the 54 base pairs (bp) of coding sequences found in exon 33 of the pro-alpha 2(I) gene (COL1A2). To reduce the amount of nucleotide sequencing required, heteroduplexes were prepared from two of the clones, one normal and the other lacking exon 33, and reacted with a water-soluble carbodiimide under conditions in which nonbase-paired G and T nucleotides are specifically modified by the reagent. Analysis of the heteroduplexes by immunoelectron microscopy suggested that the sequence variation near the codons of exon 33 was the only sequence difference in the cDNA clones. Amplification of cDNA from the proband by polymerase chain reaction gave products of two sizes, one of the expected size for the normal sequence and the other of the expected size for a product lacking the 54 bp in exon 33. To define the mutation in genomic DNA, a 1.6-kilobase region spanning exons 32 and 34 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and DNA heteroduplexes were prepared from the products. The heteroduplexes were treated with a water-soluble carbodiimide and then used as templates for primer extension under conditions in which extension terminates at the site of a carbodiimide-modified base. The results suggested a mismatch near the exon-intron boundary of exon 33 and a second mismatch near the 3' end of intron 33. Nucleotide sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products revealed a single-base substitution in one allele that changed the moderately conserved G at position +5 of the 5' splice site of intron 33 to an A. In addition, there was an apparently neutral single-base substitution that placed both a G and T at position +661 of intron 33. The results provide only the third example of a mutation in the G at the +5 position of an intron that causes aberrant RNA splicing. Also, the results demonstrate that use of techniques involving carbodiimide modification of DNA heteroduplexes can reduce the amount of nucleotide sequencing necessary to define mutations in large and complex genes."
https://openalex.org/W1539545968,"Changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) lipid composition were shown to alter its interaction with the LDL receptor, thus affecting its cellular uptake. Upon incubation of LDL with 5 units/ml cholesterol esterase (CEase) for 1 h at 37 degrees C, there was a 33% reduction in lipoprotein cholesteryl ester content, paralleled by an increment in its unesterified cholesterol. CEase-LDL, in comparison to native LDL, was smaller in size, possessed fewer free lysine amino groups (by 14%), and demonstrated reduced binding to heparin (by 83%) and reduced immunoreactivity against monoclonal antibodies directed toward epitopes along the LDL apoB-100. Incubation of CEase-LDL with the J-774 macrophage-like cell line resulted in about a 30% reduction in lipoprotein binding and degradation in comparison to native LDL, and this was associated with a 20% reduction in macrophage cholesterol mass. Similarly, CEase-LDL degradation by mouse peritoneal macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, and human skin fibroblasts was reduced by 20-44% in comparison to native LDL. CEase-LDL uptake by macrophages was mediated via the LDL receptor and not the scavenger receptor. CEase activity toward LDL was demonstrated in plasma and in cells of the arterial wall such as macrophages and endothelial cells. Thus, CEase modification of LDL may take place in vivo, and this phenomenon may have a role in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1524456379,"The effects of extra, plasmid-borne rRNA genes on the synthesis rate of rRNA in Escherichia coli were examined by measuring the fraction of total RNA synthesis that is rRNA and tRNA (rs/rt), the cytoplasmic concentration of guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), and the absolute rates of RNA and protein synthesis. Experiments were carried out in different growth media and with two different strains of E. coli, B/r and K-12. The results indicated: 1) increased rrn gene dosage from either intact or defective rrn genes reduced bacterial growth rates and ribosome activity (protein synthesis rate/average ribosome), and increased rs/rt. 2) Extra intact, but not extra defective, plasmid-borne rrn genes caused the level of ppGpp to be increased in comparison to the pBR322-carrying control strain. 3) As a function of ppGpp, rs/rt was increased with either intact or defective rrn genes. 4) The rRNA synthesis rate/rrn gene was reduced in the presence of extra rrn genes; this reduction in gene activity was greater with intact than with defective rrn genes. An analysis of these results showed that they are consistent with the ppGpp hypothesis of rRNA control but not with a feedback effector role of translating ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1481368071,"Evidence is presented outlining basic properties of a previously undescribed facilitative transport system mediating transfer of methotrexate (MTX) polyglutamates from the cytoplasmic to the lysosomal compartment of the cell. These experiments were conducted using purified lysosomes prepared from murine S180 cells, and a model substrate ([3H]MTX + G1; methotrexate with 1 additional glutamyl residue) to examine biological aspects as well as pharmacological significance of this process in a tumor cell model. The data, expressed as a function of latent beta-hexosaminidase activity, a measure of lysosomal integrity, show that [3H]MTX + G1 uptake in lysosomes is temperature-dependent, is stimulated specifically by magnesium chloride and potassium chloride with maximal enhancement observed in the presence of both agents together, exhibits Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics with Km and Vmax values of 346 +/- 39 microM and 2.8 +/- 0.3 pmol/min/unit of beta-hexosaminidase activity, respectively, and is competitively inhibited by longer chain polyglutamates with increasing effectiveness as shown by Ki values of 334 +/- 19, 201 +/- 16, 106 +/- 13, and 42 +/- 8 microM, for MTX + G1, MTX + G2, MTX + G3, and MTX + G4, respectively. In addition, uptake is inversely related to medium osmolarity indicating that the phenomenon we observe represents internalization of the [3H]MTX + G1 and not adsorption to a possible surface binding site. As a whole, the data are consistent with a single mediated transport system shared by all MTX polyglutamates for entry into lysosomes. It is our view that this transport system represents the initial step in the degradation of polyglutamates in the cell. In addition, based on a comparative analysis of the kinetics for hydrolysis and transport, we suggest that it is also the limiting step in this process and, as such, regulates the extent of degradation of the free cellular pools of these compounds."

https://openalex.org/W1593990087,"B cells express on their surface the membrane form of IgM (mIgM). Upon differentiation, the resulting plasma cells synthesize and secrete large amounts of the secretory form of IgM (sIgM). Surprisingly, B lymphocytes synthesize an excess of secretory mu chain over the expressed membrane mu chain. However, the sIgM is degraded intracellularly, indicating regulation of IgM expression at the post-translational level. In the present report, we show that the assembly, maturation, and degradation of IgM in 38C B lymphocytes are highly accelerated above a certain threshold temperature. Furthermore, the degradation of sIgM is delayed and takes place by the time the maturation of mIgM in the trans-Golgi is almost completed. Neither chloroquine nor monensin has any effect on this degradation, demonstrating a nonlysosomal pre-trans-Golgi process. In addition, the degradation is of endoglycosidase H-sensitive assembled sIgM molecules. We conclude that the degradation of sIgM in 38C B lymphocytes is a postendoplasmic reticulum, pre-trans-Golgi process. We suggest that this degradation process plays a role in the post-translational regulation of expression of soluble lumenal sIgM."

The biochemistry of carotenoid biosynthesis in eukaryotes is known, whereas evidence for the genes specifying this biosynthetic pathway is scant. We report here the nucleotide sequence and expression of a gene likely encoding crtE (prephytoene pyrophosphate dehydrogenase). The reaction product of this enzyme is phytoene, a C40 carotenoid precursor common to all organisms. The gene is found in the cyanelle (plastid) DNA of an eukaryotic alga, Cyanophora paradoxa.

The identity and similarity scores of CrtE from cyanelles with the corresponding protein from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus are 28.6 and 68.5%, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1533953068,"Dimyristoylphosphatidylazidothymidine has been shown to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in CEM or U937 cells infected with the LAV-1 strain in vitro, but its metabolism and mechanism of antiretroviral activity have not been determined (Hostetler, K. Y., Stuhmiller, L. M., Lenting, H. B. M., van den Bosch, H., and Richman, D. D., J. Biol. Chem. (1990) 265, 6112-6117). We synthesized phosphatidylazidothymidine labeled with tritium in the 5'-position of dideoxyribose and incubated the phospholipid prodrug with CEM cells for 24 h. The radioactive products were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography. Phosphatidylazidothymidine is deacylated by cellular phospholipases A to lysophosphatidylazidothymidine, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to glycero-3-phospho-5'-azidothymidine by lysophospholipases. Phosphodiesteratic cleavage of glycero-3-phospho-5'-azidothymidine occurs with formation of azidothymidine (AZT) or AZT-5'-monophosphate. Anabolic phosphorylation leads to the formation of AZT-diphosphate and AZT-triphosphate. To evaluate the possibility of direct inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase by phosphatidyl-AZT, lysophosphatidyl-AZT or glycero-3-phospho-5'-AZT, we synthesized these compounds and found them to lack the ability to inhibit HIV recombinant reverse transcriptase in vitro. AZT-triphosphate was greater than 10,000 times more potent in inhibiting reverse transcriptase activity. Thus, phosphatidyl-AZT exerts its antiviral activity by metabolic conversion to AZT-triphosphate. Phospholipid prodrugs of this type may be useful in treating the macrophage reservoir of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W1578212340,"Abstract The carbohydrate-binding specificity of a novel plant lectin isolated from the seeds of Tetracarpidium conophorum (Nigerian walnut) has been studied by quantitative hapten inhibition assays and by determining the behavior of a number of oligosaccharides and glycopeptides on lectin-Sepharose affinity columns. The Tetracarpidium lectin shows preference for simple, unbranched oligosaccharides containing a terminal Gal beta 1----4GlNAc sequence over a Gal beta 1----3GlcNAc sequence and substitution by sialic acid or fucose of the terminal galactose residue, the subterminal N-acetylglucosamine or more distally located sugar residues of oligosaccharides reduce binding activity. Branched complex-type glycans containing either Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc or Gal beta 1----3GlcNAc termini bind with higher affinity than simpler oligosaccharides. The lectin shows highest affinity for a tri-antennary glycan carrying Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc substituents on C-2 and C-4 of Man alpha 1----3 and C-2 of Man alpha 1----6 core residues. Bi- and tri-glycans lacking this branching pattern bind more weakly. Tetra-antennary glycans and mono- and di-branched hybrid-type glycans also bind weakly to the immobilized lectin. Therefore, Tetracarpidium lectin complements the binding specificities of well-known lectins such as Datura stramonium agglutinin, Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin, and lentil lectin and will be a useful additional tool for the identification and separation of complex-type glycans."
https://openalex.org/W1537745861,"We have isolated several Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with temperature-sensitive defects in the recycling of receptors after endocytosis. These cell lines were selected using fluorescence-activated cell sorting for retention of a pulse of labeled transferrin after a chase in the presence of unlabeled transferrin. One of these cell lines, TfT1.11, was selected for further characterization. In TfT1.11 the trapping of transferrin within the cells is paralleled by a loss of cell surface transferrin receptors. Within 4 h after the shift from 33 to 41 degrees C the surface binding of transferrin is reduced to 18% of parental cells at 41 degrees C. The trapping of transferrin and the loss of transferrin receptor from the cell surface are caused by a temperature-conditional 5.5-fold decrease in the initial rate of transferrin recycling. TfT1.11 cells also rapidly lose 89% of their ability to take up alpha 2-macroglobulin after the temperature shift to 41 degrees C. These data indicate that the TfT1.11 cell line has a pleiotropic defect in receptor recycling."
https://openalex.org/W1680011378,"The SSK41 cell is an immunoglobulin IgM+ human neoplastic B-cell line that switches to IgG+ cells (SSK gamma) spontaneously. We isolated a derivative of SSK41 (SSKWB) that expressed both IgM and IgG. Studies on the Ig heavy chain gene organization have shown that the SSKWB cell had two identical VDJ genes on the same chromosome; one linked to the C mu gene and the other to the C gamma 1 gene, both of which are transcribed to produce mu- and gamma-mRNAs with the same VDJ sequence. We also isolated the two switch variants derived from the SSKWB cell by cell sorter: 1G (IgG+) and 11M (IgM+). The 1G cells contained two populations; one had a similar genetic organization as SSK gamma and expressed only IgG1, and the other carried the same genetic organization as the SSKWB cell but produced aberrantly spliced mu-chain mRNA, in which the hydrophobic signal sequence exon is directly joined to the C mu exon. Te 11M cell deleted the VDJ-C gamma 1 segment of the SSKWB cell and expressed IgM. These results raise the interesting possibility of another mechanism for class switching."

To study the events that follow the interaction of gp120 with CD4, we have incorporated CD4 into lipid bilayers and recorded the electrical changes which occur after the addition of gp120. Interaction of gp120 to CD4-containing bilayers induces multistate ion-permeable channels with a maximum conductance of 380-400 picosiemens. When CD4+ bilayers were preexposed to either MHCII or to OKT4A antibody, no channels were formed after the addition of gp120. These results indicate that CD(4+)-containing bilayers bind gp120, MHCII, and OKT4A, that binding of gp120 produces ion-permeable channels, and that CD4+ bilayers can be used to assay for gp120 in the solution bathing the bilayer."
