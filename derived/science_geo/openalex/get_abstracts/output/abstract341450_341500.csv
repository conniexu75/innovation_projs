https://openalex.org/W2072599961,"Plant macrofossils in ancient packrat middens document the presence of woodland communities in most of the present Chihuahuan, Sonoran, and Mohave deserts in the southwestern United States during the late Wisconsinan (22,000 to 11,000 years before present by radiocarbon dating). Warm desert species were common in the woodlands at lower elevations and mixed conifer and subalpine forests were present at high elevations. Inferred mild, wet winters and cool summers produced unusual plant and animal associations compared to those of today. Montane communities acquired modern aspects and more mesophytic species disappeared from lower woodlands about 11,000 years ago. Early Holocene xeric woodlands and an inferred winter precipitation regime persisted until about 8000 years ago. The present circulation patterns, rainfall regimes, and biotic distributions probably formed as a result of the melting of the continental ice sheets. Southwestern communities appear to have responded quickly to climatic changes compared to the gradual responses of central and eastern United States forest communities."

These growth procedures, carried out in the same molecular beam epitaxy systems commonly used for the growth of semiconductor films, have yielded a variety of new materials and structures that may prove useful for integrated electronics and integrated optical device applications. Examples are given for growth on GaAs and ZnSe, including magnetic sandwiches and patterned structures."

These nanometer-scale electrodes have enabled the measurement of electron-transfer rate constants, k(het), that are two orders of magnitude faster than k(het) values accessible with any other electrochemical method."
https://openalex.org/W2072325285,"Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of the folding of a globular protein, apoplastocyanin, have been undertaken in the context of a new lattice model of proteins that includes both side chains and a-carbon backbone atoms and that can approximate native conformations at the level of 2 angstroms (root mean square) or better. Starting from random-coil unfolded states, the model apoplastocyanin was folded to a native conformation that is topologically similar to the real protein. The present simulations used a marginal propensity for local secondary structure consistent with but by no means enforcing the native conformation and a full hydrophobicity scale in which any nonbonded pair of side chains could interact. These molecules folded through a punctuated on-site mechanism of assembly where folding initiated at or near one of the turns ultimately found in the native conformation. Thus these simulations represent a partial solution to the globular-protein folding problem."
https://openalex.org/W2047082081,"Interspecific comparisons of animal population density to body size has been the subject of active research in the last decade, especially for terrestrial animals when considering particular taxa or taxonomic assemblages. Studies of rocky intertidal communities showed that animal population density scales with body size to the -0.77 power. This relation held within local communities representing a broad array of animal taxa and was not affected by a dramatic alteration in the network of between-species interactions, as revealed by two long-term human exclusion experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1983608937,"Quantitative analysis of 3579 trees recorded in the Classic Maya city of Cobá, Quintana Roo, Mexico, indicates a strong relation between the location and quantity of certain trees producing fruit, fiber, bark, and resin, high-status vaulted architecture, and their distance from the center of the site out toward the fringes. The relationships suggest agreement between the residence pattern of Cobá and Diego de Landa's 16th-century class-oriented description of Maya towns during preconquest times."

https://openalex.org/W1976920813,"A national program has been proposed that would develop a new generation of supermodels for the world's climate. The program is mandated to provide more climate models for some specific areas of the globe. A major problem facing the climate modelers is that they do not understand how the weather works well enough to tell a model how to simulate climate realistically. Computer speeds will have to increase by a factor of 10,000 over those of current machines in order to meet this task. Currently there are two schools of thought as to how to solve the problem: the Computer Hardware, Advanced Mathematics and Model Physics (CHAMMP) Climate Modeling Program has proposed to improve computer capacity, and the other approach proposed by the Climate Systems Modeling Program (CSMP) embraces independent ideas for plugging some of the scientific gaps, such as how clouds behave, how the ocean takes up carbon dioxide, and how the geologic record can be used to test a model's performance. A seven-agency program for all of global changes has requested a 1991 fiscal year budget of $1 billion dollars to try to solve the climate modelling problem - hopefully by attracting new talent."
