https://openalex.org/W4310774393,"Abstract Preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection by modulating viral host receptors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 1 , could represent a new chemoprophylactic approach for COVID-19 that complements vaccination 2,3 . However, the mechanisms that control the expression of ACE2 remain unclear. Here we show that the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a direct regulator of ACE2 transcription in several tissues affected by COVID-19, including the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems. We then use the over-the-counter compound z-guggulsterone and the off-patent drug ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to reduce FXR signalling and downregulate ACE2 in human lung, cholangiocyte and intestinal organoids and in the corresponding tissues in mice and hamsters. We show that the UDCA-mediated downregulation of ACE2 reduces susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, in vivo and in human lungs and livers perfused ex situ. Furthermore, we reveal that UDCA reduces the expression of ACE2 in the nasal epithelium in humans. Finally, we identify a correlation between UDCA treatment and positive clinical outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection using retrospective registry data, and confirm these findings in an independent validation cohort of recipients of liver transplants. In conclusion, we show that FXR has a role in controlling ACE2 expression and provide evidence that modulation of this pathway could be beneficial for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection, paving the way for future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4311662446,"Abstract It remains unclear why acute depletion of CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin only marginally affects expression of most genes despite substantially perturbing three-dimensional (3D) genome folding at the level of domains and structural loops. To address this conundrum, we used high-resolution Micro-C and nascent transcript profiling in mouse embryonic stem cells. We find that enhancer–promoter (E–P) interactions are largely insensitive to acute (3-h) depletion of CTCF, cohesin or WAPL. YY1 has been proposed as a structural regulator of E–P loops, but acute YY1 depletion also had minimal effects on E–P loops, transcription and 3D genome folding. Strikingly, live-cell, single-molecule imaging revealed that cohesin depletion reduced transcription factor (TF) binding to chromatin. Thus, although CTCF, cohesin, WAPL or YY1 is not required for the short-term maintenance of most E–P interactions and gene expression, our results suggest that cohesin may facilitate TFs to search for and bind their targets more efficiently."
https://openalex.org/W4310773007,"Human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines are a powerful tool for studying development and disease, but the considerable phenotypic variation between lines makes it challenging to replicate key findings and integrate data across research groups. To address this issue, we sub-cloned candidate human iPSC lines and deeply characterized their genetic properties using whole genome sequencing, their genomic stability upon CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing, and their phenotypic properties including differentiation to commonly used cell types. These studies identified KOLF2.1J as an all-around well-performing iPSC line. We then shared KOLF2.1J with groups around the world who tested its performance in head-to-head comparisons with their own preferred iPSC lines across a diverse range of differentiation protocols and functional assays. On the strength of these findings, we have made KOLF2.1J and its gene-edited derivative clones readily accessible to promote the standardization required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field."
https://openalex.org/W4310773968,"Abstract The process of cancer immunosurveillance is a mechanism of tumour suppression that can protect the host from cancer development throughout its lifetime 1,2 . However, it is unknown whether the effectiveness of cancer immunosurveillance fluctuates over a single day. Here we demonstrate that the initial time of day of tumour engraftment dictates the ensuing tumour size across mouse cancer models. Using immunodeficient mice as well as mice lacking lineage-specific circadian functions, we show that dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 + T cells exert circadian anti-tumour functions that control melanoma volume. Specifically, we find that rhythmic trafficking of DCs to the tumour draining lymph node governs a circadian response of tumour-antigen-specific CD8 + T cells that is dependent on the circadian expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD80. As a consequence, cancer immunotherapy is more effective when synchronized with DC functions, shows circadian outcomes in mice and suggests similar effects in humans. These data demonstrate that the circadian rhythms of anti-tumour immune components are not only critical for controlling tumour size but can also be of therapeutic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4311585488,"Histone 3 lysine27-to-methionine (H3-K27M) mutations most frequently occur in diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) of the childhood pons but are also increasingly recognized in adults. Their potential heterogeneity at different ages and midline locations is vastly understudied. Here, through dissecting the single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial architectures of a comprehensive cohort of patient H3-K27M DMGs, we delineate how age and anatomical location shape glioma cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic features in light of the shared driver mutation. We show that stem-like oligodendroglial precursor-like cells, present across all clinico-anatomical groups, display varying levels of maturation dependent on location. We reveal a previously underappreciated relationship between mesenchymal cancer cell states and age, linked to age-dependent differences in the immune microenvironment. Further, we resolve the spatial organization of H3-K27M DMG cell populations and identify a mitotic oligodendroglial-lineage niche. Collectively, our study provides a powerful framework for rational modeling and therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4310781882,"Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), by reinvigorating CD8 + T cell mediated immunity, have revolutionized cancer therapy. Yet, the systemic CD8 + T cell distribution, a potential biomarker of ICI response, remains poorly characterized. We assessed safety, imaging dose and timing, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of zirconium-89-labeled, CD8-specific, one-armed antibody positron emission tomography tracer 89 ZED88082A in patients with solid tumors before and ~30 days after starting ICI therapy (NCT04029181). No tracer-related side effects occurred. Positron emission tomography imaging with 10 mg antibody revealed 89 ZED88082A uptake in normal lymphoid tissues, and tumor lesions across the body varying within and between patients two days after tracer injection ( n = 38, median patient maximum standard uptake value (SUV max ) 5.2, IQI 4.0–7.4). Higher SUV max was associated with mismatch repair deficiency and longer overall survival. Uptake was higher in lesions with stromal/inflamed than desert immunophenotype. Tissue radioactivity was localized to areas with immunohistochemically confirmed CD8 expression. Re-imaging patients on treatment showed no change in average (geometric mean) tumor tracer uptake compared to baseline, but individual lesions showed diverse changes independent of tumor response. The imaging data suggest enormous heterogeneity in CD8 + T cell distribution and pharmacodynamics within and between patients. In conclusion, 89 ZED88082A can characterize the complex dynamics of CD8 + T cells in the context of ICIs, and may inform immunotherapeutic treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4310496865,"The concept of senescence as a phenomenon limited to proliferating cells has been challenged by growing evidence of senescence-like features in terminally differentiated cells, including neurons. The persistence of senescent cells late in life is associated with tissue dysfunction and increased risk of age-related disease. We found that Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains have significantly higher proportions of neurons that express senescence markers, and their distribution indicates bystander effects. AD patient-derived directly induced neurons (iNs) exhibit strong transcriptomic, epigenetic, and molecular biomarker signatures, indicating a specific human neuronal senescence-like state. AD iN single-cell transcriptomics revealed that senescent-like neurons face oncogenic challenges and metabolic dysfunction as well as display a pro-inflammatory signature. Integrative profiling of the inflammatory secretome of AD iNs and patient cerebral spinal fluid revealed a neuronal senescence-associated secretory phenotype that could trigger astrogliosis in human astrocytes. Finally, we show that targeting senescence-like neurons with senotherapeutics could be a strategy for preventing or treating AD."
https://openalex.org/W4311086202,"Canonical (H3.1/H3.2) and noncanonical (H3.3) histone 3 K27M-mutant gliomas have unique spatiotemporal distributions, partner alterations and molecular profiles. The contribution of the cell of origin to these differences has been challenging to uncouple from the oncogenic reprogramming induced by the mutation. Here, we perform an integrated analysis of 116 tumors, including single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility, 3D chromatin architecture and epigenomic profiles, and show that K27M-mutant gliomas faithfully maintain chromatin configuration at developmental genes consistent with anatomically distinct oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). H3.3K27M thalamic gliomas map to prosomere 2-derived lineages. In turn, H3.1K27M ACVR1-mutant pontine gliomas uniformly mirror early ventral NKX6-1+/SHH-dependent brainstem OPCs, whereas H3.3K27M gliomas frequently resemble dorsal PAX3+/BMP-dependent progenitors. Our data suggest a context-specific vulnerability in H3.1K27M-mutant SHH-dependent ventral OPCs, which rely on acquisition of ACVR1 mutations to drive aberrant BMP signaling required for oncogenesis. The unifying action of K27M mutations is to restrict H3K27me3 at PRC2 landing sites, whereas other epigenetic changes are mainly contingent on the cell of origin chromatin state and cycling rate."
https://openalex.org/W4310668128,"Intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains are massive molecular machines that traffic proteins between cilia and the cell body. Each IFT train is a dynamic polymer of two large complexes (IFT-A and -B) and motor proteins, posing a formidable challenge to mechanistic understanding. Here, we reconstituted the complete human IFT-A complex and obtained its structure using cryo-EM. Combined with AlphaFold prediction and genome-editing studies, our results illuminate how IFT-A polymerizes, interacts with IFT-B, and uses an array of β-propeller and TPR domains to create ""carriages"" of the IFT train that engage TULP adaptor proteins. We show that IFT-A⋅TULP carriages are essential for cilia localization of diverse membrane proteins, as well as ICK-the key kinase regulating IFT train turnaround. These data establish a structural link between IFT-A's distinct functions, provide a blueprint for IFT-A in the train, and shed light on how IFT evolved from a proto-coatomer ancestor."
https://openalex.org/W4310530976,"Observational fear, a form of emotional contagion, is thought to be a basic form of affective empathy. However, the neural process engaged at the specific moment when socially acquired information provokes an emotional response remains elusive. Here, we show that reciprocal projections between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the right hemisphere are essential for observational fear, and 5–7 Hz neural oscillations were selectively increased in those areas at the onset of observational freezing. A closed-loop disruption demonstrated the causal relationship between 5–7 Hz oscillations in the cingulo-amygdala circuit and observational fear responses. The increase/decrease in theta power induced by optogenetic manipulation of the hippocampal theta rhythm bi-directionally modulated observational fear. Together, these results indicate that hippocampus-dependent 5–7 Hz oscillations in the cingulo-amygdala circuit in the right hemisphere are the essential component of the cognitive process that drives empathic fear, but not freezing, in general."
https://openalex.org/W4310496609,"The enthesis, a fibrocartilaginous transition between tendon and bone, is necessary for force transfer from muscle to bone to produce joint motion. The enthesis is prone to injury due to mechanical demands, and it cannot regenerate. A better understanding of how the enthesis develops will lead to more effective therapies to prevent pathology and promote regeneration. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to define the developmental transcriptome of the mouse entheses over postnatal stages. Six resident cell types, including enthesis progenitors and mineralizing chondrocytes, were identified along with their transcription factor regulons and temporal regulation. Following the prior discovery of the necessity of Gli1-lineage cells for mouse enthesis development and healing, we then examined their transcriptomes at single-cell resolution and demonstrated clonogenicity and multipotency of the Gli1-expressing progenitors. Transplantation of Gli1-lineage cells to mouse enthesis injuries improved healing, demonstrating their therapeutic potential for enthesis regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W4311586524,"Abstract Determining the functional role of thousands of genetic sequence variants (mutations) associated with genetic diseases is a major challenge. Here we present clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Select TIME , CRISPR-Select SPACE and CRISPR-Select STATE , a set of flexible knock-in assays that introduce a genetic variant in a cell population and track its absolute frequencies relative to an internal, neutral control mutation as a function of time, space or a cell state measurable by flow cytometry. Phenotypically, CRISPR-Select can thereby determine, for example, pathogenicity, drug responsiveness/resistance or in vivo tumor promotion by a specific variant. Mechanistically, CRISPR-Select can dissect how the variant elicits the phenotype by causally linking the variant to motility/invasiveness or any cell state or biochemical process with a flow cytometry marker. The method is applicable to organoids, nontransformed or cancer cell lines. It is accurate, quantitative, fast and simple and works in single-well or 96-well higher throughput format. CRISPR-Select provides a versatile functional variant assay for research, diagnostics and drug development for genetic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4310522850,"The formation of complexes between Rab11 and its effectors regulates multiple aspects of membrane trafficking, including recycling and ciliogenesis. WD repeat-containing protein 44 (WDR44) is a structurally uncharacterized Rab11 effector that regulates ciliogenesis by competing with prociliogenesis factors for Rab11 binding. Here, we present a detailed biochemical and biophysical characterization of the WDR44-Rab11 complex and define specific residues mediating binding. Using AlphaFold2 modeling and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we generated a molecular model of the Rab11-WDR44 complex. The Rab11-binding domain of WDR44 interacts with switch I, switch II, and the interswitch region of Rab11. Extensive mutagenesis of evolutionarily conserved residues in WDR44 at the interface identified numerous complex-disrupting mutations. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we found that the dynamics of the WDR44-Rab11 interface are distinct from the Rab11 effector FIP3, with WDR44 forming a more extensive interface with the switch II helix of Rab11 compared with FIP3. The WDR44 interaction was specific to Rab11 over evolutionarily similar Rabs, with mutations defining the molecular basis of Rab11 specificity. Finally, WDR44 can be phosphorylated by Sgk3, with this leading to reorganization of the Rab11-binding surface on WDR44. Overall, our results provide molecular detail on how WDR44 interacts with Rab11 and how Rab11 can form distinct effector complexes that regulate membrane trafficking events."
https://openalex.org/W4310668117,"Transfer RNAs undergo diverse posttranscriptional modifications to regulate a myriad of cellular events including translation, stress response, and viral replication. These posttranscriptional modifications are synthesized by site-specific modification enzymes. Recent RNA-seq techniques have revealed multiple features of tRNA such as tRNA abundance, tRNA modification, and tRNA structure. Here, we adapt a tRNA-sequencing technique and design a new functional analysis where we perform mutational profiling of tRNA modifications to gain mechanistic insights into how tRNA modification enzymes recognize substrate tRNA. Profiling of Geobacillus stearothermophilus tRNAs and protein orthology analysis predict the existence of natural modifications in 44 tRNA molecular species of G. stearothermophilus. We selected the 1-methyladenosine modification at position 22 (m1A22) and tRNA (m1A22) methyltransferase (TrmK) for further analysis. Relative quantification of m1A22 levels in 59 tRNA transcripts by mutational profiling reveals that TrmK selectively methylates a subset of tRNAs. Using 240 variants of tRNALeu transcripts, we demonstrate the conserved nucleosides including U8, A14, G15, G18, G19, U55, Purine57, and A58 are important for the methyl transfer reaction of TrmK. Additional biochemical experiments reveal that TrmK strictly recognizes U8, A14, G18, and U55 in tRNA. Furthermore, these findings from tRNALeu variants were crossvalidated using variants of three different tRNA species. Finally, a model of the TrmK-tRNA complex structure was constructed based on our findings and previous biochemical and structural studies by others. Collectively, our study expands functional analyses of tRNA modification enzyme in a high-throughput manner where our assay rapidly identifies substrates from a large pool of tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4310785027,"Stringent factors orchestrate bacterial cell reprogramming through increasing the level of the alarmones (p)ppGpp. In Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, SpoT hydrolyzes (p)ppGpp to counteract the synthetase activity of RelA. However, structural information about how SpoT controls the levels of (p)ppGpp is missing. Here we present the crystal structure of the hydrolase-only SpoT from Acinetobacter baumannii and uncover the mechanism of intramolecular regulation of 'long'-stringent factors. In contrast to ribosome-associated Rel/RelA that adopt an elongated structure, SpoT assumes a compact τ-shaped structure in which the regulatory domains wrap around a Core subdomain that controls the conformational state of the enzyme. The Core is key to the specialization of long RelA-SpoT homologs toward either synthesis or hydrolysis: the short and structured Core of SpoT stabilizes the τ-state priming the hydrolase domain for (p)ppGpp hydrolysis, whereas the longer, more dynamic Core domain of RelA destabilizes the τ-state priming the monofunctional RelA for efficient (p)ppGpp synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4310859961,"G-quadruplex (G4)-forming DNA sequences are abundant in the human genome, and they are hot spots for inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and genome instability. The mechanisms involved in protecting G4s and maintaining genome stability have not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that RAD52 plays an important role in suppressing DSB accumulation at G4s, and RAD52-deficient cells are sensitive to G4-stabilizing compounds. Mechanistically, we showed that RAD52 is required for efficient homologous recombination repair at G4s, likely due to its function in recruiting structure-specific endonuclease XPF to remove G4 structures at DSB ends. We also demonstrated that upon G4 stabilization, endonuclease MUS81 mediates cleavage of stalled replication forks at G4s. The resulting DSBs recruit RAD52 and XPF to G4s for processing DSB ends to facilitate homologous recombination repair. Loss of RAD52 along with G4-resolving helicase FANCJ leads to a significant increase of DSB accumulation before and after treatment with the G4-stabilizing compound pyridostatin, and RAD52 exhibits a synthetic lethal interaction with FANCJ. Collectively, our findings reveal a new role of RAD52 in protecting G4 integrity and provide insights for new cancer treatment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4310474862,"Oxidation of DNA bases generates mutagenic and cytotoxic lesions that are implicated in cancer and other diseases. Oxidative base lesions, including 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, are typically removed through base excision repair. In addition, oxidized deoxynucleotides such as 8-oxo-dGTP are depleted by sanitizing enzymes to preclude DNA incorporation. While pathways that counter threats posed by 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine are well characterized, mechanisms protecting against the major adenine oxidation product, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoadenine (oxoA), are poorly understood. Human DNA polymerases incorporate dGTP or dCTP opposite oxoA, producing mispairs that can cause A→C or A→G mutations. oxoA also perturbs the activity of enzymes acting on DNA and causes interstrand crosslinks. To inform mechanisms for oxoA repair, we characterized oxoA excision by human thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), an enzyme known to remove modified pyrimidines, including deaminated and oxidized forms of cytosine and 5-methylcystosine. Strikingly, TDG excises oxoA from G⋅oxoA, A⋅oxoA, or C⋅oxoA pairs much more rapidly than it acts on the established pyrimidine substrates, whereas it exhibits comparable activity for T⋅oxoA and pyrimidine substrates. The oxoA activity depends strongly on base pairing and is 370-fold higher for G⋅oxoA versus T⋅oxoA pairs. The intrinsically disordered regions of TDG contribute minimally to oxoA excision, whereas two conserved residues (N140 and N191) are catalytically essential. Escherichia coli mismatch-specific uracil DNA-glycosylase lacks significant oxoA activity, exhibiting excision rates 4 to 5 orders of magnitude below that of its ortholog, TDG. Our results reveal oxoA as an unexpectedly efficient purine substrate for TDG and underscore the large evolutionary divergence of TDG and mismatch-specific uracil DNA-glycosylase."
https://openalex.org/W4310576518,"Background In vitro studies suggesting that REGEN-COV (casirivimab plus imdevimab monoclonal antibodies) had poor efficacy against Omicron-variant SARS-CoV-2 infection led to amendment of REGEN-COV’s Emergency Use Authorization to recommend use only in regions without high Omicron prevalence. REGEN-COV’s relative clinical effectiveness for Omicron is unknown. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective cohort study of non-hospitalized adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction at the University of Miami Health System from July 19 –November 21, 2021 (Delta period) and December 6, 2021 –January 7, 2022 (Omicron period). Subjects were stratified be REGEN-COV receipt within 72h of test positivity and by time period of infection. We constructed multivariable logistic regression models to assess the differential association of REGEN-COV receipt with hospitalization within 30 days (primary outcome) and ED presentation; all models included three exposure terms (REGEN-COV receipt, Omicron vs Delta period, interaction of REGEN-COV with time period) and potential confounders (vaccination status, vaccine boosting, cancer diagnosis). Our cohort consisted of 2,083 adults in the Delta period (213 [10.2%] received REGEN-COV) and 4,201 in the Omicron period (156 [3.7%] received REGEN-COV). Hospitalization was less common during the Omicron period than during Delta (0.9% vs 1.7%, p = 0.78) and more common for patients receiving REGEN-COV than not (5.7% vs 0.9%, p&lt;0.001). After adjustment, we found no differential association of REGEN-COV use during Omicron vs Delta with hospitalization within 30d (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] for the interaction term: 2.31 [0.76–6.92], p = 0.13). Similarly, we found no differential association for hospitalization within 15d (2.45 [0.63–9.59], p = 0.20) or emergency department presentation within 30d (1.43 [0.57–3.51], p = 0.40) or within 15d (1.79 [0.65–4.82], p = 0.30). Conclusions Within the limitations of this study’s power to detect a difference, we identified no differential effectiveness of REGEN-COV in the context of Omicron vs Delta SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W4310702335,"Pathogenic species from the Mycobacterium genus are responsible for a number of adverse health conditions in humans and animals that threaten health security and the economy worldwide. Mycobacteria have up to five specialized secretion systems (ESX-1 to ESX-5) that transport virulence factors across their complex cell envelope to facilitate manipulation of their environment. In pathogenic species, these virulence factors influence the immune system's response and are responsible for membrane disruption and contributing to cell death. While structural details of these secretion systems have been recently described, gaps still remain in the structural understanding of the secretion mechanisms of most substrates. Here, we describe the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESX-1 secretion-associated substrate EspB bound to its chaperone EspK. We found that EspB interacts with the C-terminal domain of EspK through its helical tip. Furthermore, cryogenic electron microscopy, size exclusion chromatography analysis, and small-angle X-ray scattering experiments show that EspK keeps EspB in its secretion-competent monomeric form and prevents its oligomerization. The structure presented in this study suggests an additional secretion mechanism in ESX-1, analogous to the chaperoning of proline-glutamate (PE)-proline-proline-glutamate (PPE) proteins by EspG, where EspK facilitates the secretion of EspB in Mycobacterium species."
https://openalex.org/W4310731242,"Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a key immune regulatory protein that interacts with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), leading to T-cell suppression. Whilst this interaction is key in self-tolerance, cancer cells evade the immune system by overexpressing PD-L1. Inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway with standard monoclonal antibodies has proven a highly effective cancer treatment; however, single domain antibodies (VHH) may offer numerous potential benefits. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a diverse panel of 16 novel VHHs specific to PD-L1. The panel of VHHs demonstrate affinities of 0.7 nM to 5.1 μM and were able to completely inhibit PD-1 binding to PD-L1. The binding site for each VHH on PD-L1 was determined using NMR chemical shift perturbation mapping and revealed a common binding surface encompassing the PD-1-binding site. Additionally, we solved crystal structures of two representative VHHs in complex with PD-L1, which revealed unique binding modes. Similar NMR experiments were used to identify the binding site of CD80 on PD-L1, which is another immune response regulatory element and interacts with PD-L1 localized on the same cell surface. CD80 and PD-1 were revealed to share a highly overlapping binding site on PD-L1, with the panel of VHHs identified expected to inhibit CD80 binding. Comparison of the CD80 and PD-1 binding sites on PD-L1 enabled the identification of a potential antibody binding region able to confer specificity for the inhibition of PD-1 binding only, which may offer therapeutic benefits to counteract cancer cell evasion of the immune system."
https://openalex.org/W4310750668,"The KRAS gene is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer and gives rise to two isoforms, KRAS4A and KRAS4B. KRAS post-translational modifications (PTMs) have the potential to influence downstream signaling. However, the relationship between KRAS PTMs and oncogenic mutations remains unclear, and the extent of isoform-specific modification is unknown. Here, we present the first top-down proteomics study evaluating both KRAS4A and KRAS4B, resulting in 39 completely characterized proteoforms across colorectal cancer cell lines and primary tumor samples. We determined which KRAS PTMs are present, along with their relative abundance, and that proteoforms of KRAS4A versus KRAS4B are differentially modified. Moreover, we identified a subset of KRAS4B proteoforms lacking the C185 residue and associated C-terminal PTMs. By confocal microscopy, we confirmed that this truncated GFP-KRAS4BC185∗ proteoform is unable to associate with the plasma membrane, resulting in a decrease in MAPK signaling pathway activation. Collectively, our study provides a reference set of functionally distinct KRAS proteoforms and the colorectal cancer contexts in which they are present."
https://openalex.org/W4310779922,"Abstract The EMPEROR-Preserved trial showed that the sodium–glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 40%. Here, we report the results of a pre-specified analysis that separately evaluates these patients stratified by LVEF: preserved (≥ 50%) ( n = 4,005; 66.9%) or mid-range (41–49%). In patients with LVEF ≥ 50%, empagliflozin reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or HHF (the primary endpoint) by 17% versus placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71–0.98, P = 0.024). For the key secondary endpoint, the HR for total HHF was 0.83 (95%CI: 0.66–1.04, P = 0.11). For patients with an LVEF of 41–49%, the HR for empagliflozin versus placebo was 0.71 (95%CI: 0.57–0.88, P = 0.002) for the primary outcome ( P interaction = 0.27), and 0.57 (95%CI: 0.42–0.79, P &lt; 0.001) for total HHF ( P interaction = 0.06). These results, together with those from the EMPEROR-Reduced trial in patients with LVEF &lt; 40%, support the use of empagliflozin across the full spectrum of LVEF in heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W4310783921,"Abstract Anaplerosis is an essential feature of metabolism that allows the continuous operation of natural metabolic networks, such as the citric acid cycle, by constantly replenishing drained intermediates. However, this concept has not been applied to synthetic in vitro metabolic networks, thus far. Here we used anaplerotic strategies to directly access the core sequence of the CETCH cycle, a new-to-nature in vitro CO 2 -fixation pathway that features several C 3 –C 5 biosynthetic precursors. We drafted four different anaplerotic modules that use CO 2 to replenish the CETCH cycle’s intermediates and validated our designs by producing 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB), the C 21 -macrolide backbone of erythromycin. Our best design allowed the carbon-positive synthesis of 6-DEB via 54 enzymatic reactions in vitro at yields comparable to those with isolated 6-DEB polyketide synthase (DEBS). Our work showcases how new-to-nature anaplerotic modules can be designed and tailored to enhance and expand the synthetic capabilities of complex catalytic in vitro reaction networks."
https://openalex.org/W4311020478,"Chlamydia trachomatis (ct) is the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection worldwide and the leading cause of preventable blindness. Caseinolytic proteases (ClpP) from pathogenic bacteria are attractive antibiotic targets, particularly for bacterial species that form persister colonies with phenotypic resistance against common antibiotics. ClpP functions as a multisubunit proteolytic complex, and bacteria are eradicated when ClpP is disrupted. Although crucial for chlamydial development and the design of agents to treat chlamydia, the structures of ctClpP1 and ctClpP2 have yet to be solved. Here, we report the first crystal structure of full-length ClpP2 as an inactive homotetradecamer in a complex with a candidate antibiotic at 2.66 Å resolution. The structure details the functional domains of the ClpP2 protein subunit and includes the handle domain, which is integral to proteolytic activation. In addition, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectroscopy probed the dynamics of ClpP2, and molecular modeling of ClpP1 predicted an assembly with ClpP2. By leveraging previous enzymatic experiments, we constructed a model of ClpP2 activation and its interaction with the protease subunits ClpP1 and ClpX. The structural information presented will be relevant for future rational drug design against these targets and will lead to a better understanding of ClpP complex formation and activation within this important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W4311284539,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a public health emergency in all sectors of society, including universities and other academic institutions. This study determined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among administrators, faculty, staff, and students of a private tertiary academic institution in the Philippines over a 7 month period. It employed a serial cross-sectional method using qualitative and quantitative COVID-19 antibody test kits. A total of 1,318 participants were tested, showing 47.80% of the study population yielding IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus. A general increase in seroprevalence was observed from June to December 2021, which coincided with the vaccine roll-out of the country. All brands yielded positive antibody formation, with mRNA vaccines having higher levels than other types of vaccines. A decreasing trend in IgG reactivity was found in vaccinated individuals after 1 to 6 months of completion of the 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Where possible, IgG and T-cell reactivity and/or neutralizing capacity against SAR-CoV-2 need to be monitored regardless of vaccine brand. Together with uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters, other public health interventions such as wearing of masks and regular testing need to be continued for better protection.

https://openalex.org/W4311287630,"Inland terminals, or dry ports, have played an important role in multimodal transportation networks as transportation hubs that provide connections between seaports and hinterland economies. While important, evaluating the operational performance of a dry port is especially challenging since it depends not only on internal factors, such as the variety and number of container handling equipment (CHE) deployed, but also on other external factors, including changes in transportation policies and container demands experienced by a dry port. To properly evaluate the holistic performance of a dry port while considering all the aforementioned factors, a discrete event simulation (DES) framework is herein developed and applied to the Ladkrabang Inland Container Depot (LICD)-one of the largest dry ports in Southeast Asia-under various operational settings. Despite complicated internal operations, the devised DES framework has shown itself useful in the analyses of LICD, due largely to its flexibility that allows users to include sophisticated operational rules into models. According to our computational results, the current LICD operation is markedly ineffective as the usage rates of all CHE types are relatively low and varied across gate operators-especially the yard truck whose values range between 2.46% and 11.15% on yearly average. We also find that, by redesigning the LICD and its internal operations, the LICD's performance could be substantially enhanced-even with fewer numbers of CHE. Regarding the four CHE types, the reach stacker seems to limit LICD's capability, as its utilization tends to first reach the maximum allowable rate of 75%, while the rubber tyred gantry crane could help boost the usage rate of yard trucks, which, in turn, results in reduced container dwelling times. Nonetheless, the modified LICD could accommodate up to 140% of the current container demand before it experiences operational difficulties induced by the saturation of container flow from rail transportation."
https://openalex.org/W4310553410,"Antiestrogens (AEs) are used to treat all stages of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Selective estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen have tissue-specific partial agonist activity, while selective estrogen receptor downregulators such as fulvestrant (ICI182,780) display a more complete antiestrogenic profile. We have previously observed that fulvestrant-induced ERα SUMOylation contributes to transcriptional suppression, but whether this effect is seen with other AEs and is specific to ERα is unclear. Here we show that several AEs induce SUMOylation of ERα, but not ERβ, at different levels. Swapping domains between ERα and ERβ indicates that the ERα identity of the ligand-binding domain helices 3 and 4 (H3-H4 region), which contribute to the static part of the activation function-2 (AF-2) cofactor binding groove, is sufficient to confer fulvestrant-induced SUMOylation to ERβ. This region does not contain lysine residues unique to ERα, suggesting that ERα-specific residues in H3-H4 determine the capacity of the AE-bound ERα ligand-binding domain to recruit the SUMOylation machinery. We also show that the SUMO E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 increases SUMOylation of ERα and of ERβ containing the H3-H4 region of ERα, but not of ERβ. Together, these results shed new light on the molecular basis for the differential capacity of selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor downregulators to suppress transcription by ERα.

Two thirds of breast tumors express estrogen receptor α (ERα), a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the oncogenic effects of estrogens in these tumors, including the upregulation of proliferative genes. Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) shares conserved sequences and functional properties with ERα but is poorly expressed in most breast tumors and was reported to oppose the proliferative effects of estrogens when overexpressed in these cells (1Hall J.M. McDonnell D.P. The estrogen receptor beta-isoform (ERbeta) of the human estrogen receptor modulates ERalpha transcriptional activity and is a key regulator of the cellular response to estrogens and antiestrogens.Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5566-5578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tremblay G.B.

Upon binding to agonists such as 17β-estradiol (E2), ERs undergo a conformational change that induces binding as dimers to estrogen responsive elements (EREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes, resulting in recruitment of coactivator complexes that mediate histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and recruitment of the basal transcription machinery (5Smith C.L.

Crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ERs with different ligands revealed conserved helices whose folding generates the ligand-binding pocket. E2 binding stabilizes folding of the C-terminal helix 12 (H12) back onto the ligand binding cavity. The positioning of helix 12 above the ligand binding cavity exposes a set of amino acids essential for coactivator binding, which includes residues of helices 3, 4, 5 [the static part of activation function-2 (AF-2)] as well as from H12 (the mobile part of AF-2). Coactivators recruited by ERα AF-2 include the histone acetyl transferase complex p160-CBP/p300-pCAF, the histone remodeling complex SWI/SNF, and the mediator complex (5Smith C.L. O'Malley B.W.

Antiestrogens (AEs) are competitive ER inhibitors that prevent transactivation and block estrogen-dependent tumor growth. AEs are usually classified into two groups, SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) and SERDs (selective estrogen receptor downregulators), although AEs appear to present a spectrum of partial agonist and receptor downregulating properties (7Traboulsi T.

SERMs, including tamoxifen (Tam), the first AE used successfully for breast cancer treatment, inhibit activity of ERs in a tissue and gene-specific manner, exerting partial agonist effects on ER-mediated transcription. Tam is used in the clinic for the treatment of all stages of primary breast cancer and is approved for the prevention of breast cancer in women with high risk for the disease (8Ali S. Buluwela L.

Fulvestrant is approved in the clinic under the name Faslodex in the metastatic setting or as a second-line therapeutic option for endocrine therapy–resistant patients (34Robertson J.F. Lindemann J.

The crystal structure of the rat ERβ receptor bound to a fulvestrant analog, ICI164,384, revealed interaction of its long side chain with the coactivator binding groove, the conformation of H12 being undefined (35Pike A.C. Brzozowski A.M. Walton J. Hubbard R.E. Thorsell A.G. Li Y.L. et al.Structural insights into the mode of action of a pure antiestrogen.Structure (Camb). 2001; 9: 145-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Whether this structural feature is conserved in human ERα is unclear, as no structure of fulvestrant or analogs with long side chains in complex with ERα has been reported. Its relevance to the mechanism of action of fulvestrant as a SERD is also uncertain, as fulvestrant was reported not to induce ERβ degradation (36Peekhaus N.T. Chang T. Hayes E.C. Wilkinson H.A. Mitra S.W. Schaeffer J.M. et al.Distinct effects of the antiestrogen Faslodex on the stability of estrogen receptors-alpha and -beta in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 987-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, use of a series of ICI164,384 derivatives with variable side chain lengths revealed that the capacity of the side chain to reach into the coactivator binding groove was associated with pure antiestrogenicity in a reporter assay in hepatic HepG2 cells (37Hilmi K.

The superior transcriptional suppression observed in the presence of fulvestrant has been explained by its capacity to induce ERα ubiquitination and accelerated proteasomal turnover of ERα in estrogen target tissues and in a variety of cell lines, whereas 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT, the active metabolite of Tam) stabilizes the ERα protein (31McDonnell D.P.

However, fulvestrant fully suppresses ERα transcriptional activity in transfected hepatic HepG2 cells without enhancing its degradation (43Lupien M. Jeyakumar M. Hebert E. Hilmi K. Cotnoir-White D.

We previously reported that fulvestrant also induces modification of ERα by small ubiquitin-related modifiers 1/2/3 (SUMO1/2/3) in ER+ breast cancer cells and identified four SUMO-modified sites in human ERα by mass spectrometry (37Hilmi K.

Furthermore, induction of SUMOylation correlated with pure antiestrogenicity in our series of ICI164,384 derivatives with variable side chain lengths. Finally, preventing SUMOylation by overexpression of the SENtrin-specific Protease 1 (SENP1) deSUMOylase abolished the difference in transcriptional repression by fulvestrant and OHT in transfected ER-negative cells and in endogenously ER-expressing breast cancer cells (37Hilmi K.

Here we set out to investigate whether fulvestrant and other AEs can induce SUMOylation of ERβ as well as ERα. Using specific ER–SUMO interaction assays based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) (37Hilmi K. Hussein N. Mendoza-Sanchez R. El-Ezzy M. Ismail H.

A. 2018; 115: E2653-E2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we show that several AEs can induce SUMOylation of ERα by SUMO1 and SUMO3 in live cells. Fulvestrant was the most efficacious AE tested for modification of ERα but was inactive with ERβ. We then explored the molecular basis for the observed receptor specificity of fulvestrant using ERα/ERβ chimeras. Our results highlight the key role of ERα residues lining the static part of the cofactor binding groove in enabling recruitment of the SUMOylation machinery, including members of the SUMO E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family, to ERα in the presence of fulvestrant. To assess the impact of fulvestrant on modifications of ERα and ERβ, we first monitored their migration in Western analyses in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, which do not express detectable levels of ERα or ERβ. Treatment of cells transiently expressing ERα with fulvestrant (F) for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 h revealed a ladder of ER forms at higher molecular weight than the expected ∼65 kDa unmodified form (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, no such higher molecular weight bands were observed upon fulvestrant treatment of cells transfected with an ERβ expression vector at the same time points (Fig. 1B). To verify whether the modified bands correspond to SUMOylation of ERα, as previously reported (37Hilmi K. Hussein N. Mendoza-Sanchez R. El-Ezzy M. Ismail H. Durette C. et al.Role of SUMOylation in full antiestrogenicity.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3823-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we co-transfected the deSUMOylase SENP1 together with expression vectors for either ERα or ERβ. Expression of SENP1 prevented the generation of higher molecular weight bands in the presence of fulvestrant (Fig. 1C). Co-expression of SENP1 did not modify the ERβ migration profiles in the presence or absence of fulvestrant (Fig. 1D). Neither ERα nor ERβ were downregulated under the conditions of the assay, whether in the absence or presence of SENP1. To measure SUMOylation of ERα and ERβ in a semiquantitative manner in the presence of SERDs, we used our previously described BRET assays for interaction between ERα and SUMO1 or SUMO3 (37Hilmi K. Hussein N. Mendoza-Sanchez R. El-Ezzy M. Ismail H. Durette C. et al.Role of SUMOylation in full antiestrogenicity.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3823-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and developed similar assays for interaction between ERβ and SUMO1 or SUMO3 in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Renilla luciferase II (RLucII) was fused to the C terminus of either ERα or ERβ, and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) was fused to the N terminus of either SUMO1 or SUMO3. Titration assays were performed by transiently transfecting a fixed amount of ERα/β-RLucII and increasing amounts of YFP-SUMO3 in HEK293 cells maintained in estrogen-depleted medium 2 days before transfection and for the duration of the assay. BRET ratios were quantified by measuring the ratio of light emitted by the fluorescent acceptor and the luciferase donor upon addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine H. Net BRET ratios correspond to the difference between the measured BRET ratios and those obtained from cells transfected with ERα/β-RLucII only. Net BRET ratios were plotted as a function of the measured ratios of total fluorescence/luminescence activities, reflecting expression of the fusion proteins. As previously reported (37Hilmi K. Hussein N. Mendoza-Sanchez R. El-Ezzy M. Ismail H. Durette C. et al.Role of SUMOylation in full antiestrogenicity.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3823-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), fulvestrant (F, 2 h) induced interaction of ERα-RLucII and YFP-SUMO3 in a saturable manner, while no significant signal was detected with control vehicle treatment (Fig. 1E; see Fig. S1A for statistically significant differences in BRETmax values calculated by nonlinear regression analysis for each saturation curve). On the other hand, no increased interaction was detected with ERβ-RLucII in the same experiment in the presence of fulvestrant versus its absence (Figs. 1E and S1A). Similar results were obtained using SUMO1 instead of SUMO3 (Fig. S2, A and B). In addition, use of a YFP-SUMO1G construct, in which YFP is fused to a SUMO1 mutant that cannot be conjugated (46Ayaydin F. Dasso M. Distinct in vivo dynamics of vertebrate SUMO paralogues.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5208-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), confirmed that the BRET signals observed with ERα result from covalent interaction (Fig. S3). Further, co-transfection of the SUMO E3 ligase protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) increased the BRET signal with SUMO1 but not SUMO1G (Fig. S3). Finally, similar results were obtained with an alternative ERα fusion construct in which ERα was fused C terminally to RLucII (RLucII-ERα), indicating that the observed SUMO BRET signal in the presence of fulvestrant is insensitive to the location of the RLucII moiety (Fig. S3). We next used the SUMO BRET assay to characterize the kinetics of ERα modification by SUMO3 and determine whether ERβ modification is detected after longer incubation with pure AEs. Addition of fulvestrant resulted in a progressive increase in ERα interaction with SUMO3 over a 4 h treatment, but no significant increase in basal signal was detected with ERβ at any time point (Fig. 1F), consistent with the results observed by Western analysis (Fig. 1, A and B). Together, these results indicate that ERα is specifically SUMOylated by SUMO1 and SUMO3 in the presence of fulvestrant. To investigate whether other AEs than fulvestrant can induce SUMOylation of ERα, MCF7 breast cancer cells, which express endogenous ERα, were treated with different steroid or steroid-like AEs for 1 h. As previously observed (37Hilmi K. Hussein N. Mendoza-Sanchez R. El-Ezzy M. Ismail H. Durette C. et al.Role of SUMOylation in full antiestrogenicity.Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 32: 3823-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), OHT did not induce ERα modification (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, the SERM raloxifene (Ral) and the SERM/SERD bazedoxifene (Baz), which have bulkier side chain ends compared to OHT (Fig. 3; side chains highlighted in blue), induced low levels of ERα modifications. The SERD GDC-0927 (GDC) (Fig. 3), with reported SERD activity, as well as fulvestrant (F) and RU58668 (RU), a fulvestrant analog with the side chain linked to the steroid core at position 11β instead of 7α (Fig. 3) (7Traboulsi T.

https://openalex.org/W4310668164,"ATP1A3 encodes the α3 isoform of Na,K-ATPase. In the brain, it is expressed only in neurons. Human ATP1A3 mutations produce a wide spectrum of phenotypes, but particular syndromes are associated with unique substitutions. For arginine 756, at the junction of membrane and cytoplasmic domains, mutations produce encephalopathy during febrile infections. Here we tested the pathogenicity of p.Arg756His (R756H) in isogenic mammalian cells. R756H protein had sufficient transport activity to support cells when endogenous ATP1A1 was inhibited. It had half the turnover rate of wildtype, reduced affinity for Na+, and increased affinity for K+. There was modest endoplasmic reticulum retention during biosynthesis at 37 °C but little benefit from the folding drug phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), suggesting a tolerated level of misfolding. When cells were incubated at just 39 °C, however, α3 protein level dropped without loss of β subunit, paralleled by an increase of endogenous α1. Elevated temperature resulted in internalization of α3 from the surface along with some β subunit, accompanied by cytoplasmic redistribution of a marker of lysosomes and endosomes, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1. After return to 37 °C, α3 protein levels recovered with cycloheximide-sensitive new protein synthesis. Heating in vitro showed activity loss at a rate 20- to 30-fold faster than wildtype, indicating a temperature-dependent destabilization of protein structure. Arg756 appears to confer thermal resistance as an anchor, forming hydrogen bonds among four linearly distant parts of the Na,K-ATPase structure. Taken together, our observations are consistent with fever-induced symptoms in patients."

Integrin β1 is a transmembrane receptor that drives various cellular functions, including differentiation, migration, and phagocytosis. However, the underlying mechanisms modifying integrin β1 protein and activity in mediating monocyte/macrophage adhesion to endothelium remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that integrin β1 protein underwent S-nitrosylation in response to nitrosative stress in macrophages. To examine the effect of elevated levels of FFA on the modulation of integrin β1 expression, we treated the macrophages with a combination of oleic acid and palmitic acid (2:1) and found that FFA activated inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide and increased the integrin β1 protein level without altering the mRNA level. FFA promoted integrin β1 S-nitrosylation via inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide and prevented its degradation by decreasing binding to E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl. Furthermore, we found that increased integrin α4β1 heterodimerization resulted in monocyte/macrophage adhesion to endothelium. In conclusion, these results provided novel evidence that FFA-stimulated N--O stabilizes integrin β1 via S-nitrosylation, favoring integrin α4β1 ligation to promote vascular inflammation.

Hyperlipidemia manifested by high blood levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) is critical for the progression of multiple metabolic diseases as well as cardiovascular complications. FFA levels increase significantly in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis (1Boden G. Obesity and free fatty acids.Endocrinol. Metab. Clin.

Biol. 2018; 38: 2562-2575Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Increased FFA level causes lipotoxicity and activates the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNFα, and other endogenous endotoxin. These events are not only thought to link metabolic inflammation but also are even considered as cause of atherosclerosis and hypertension. In response to increased lipid levels, the endothelial cells release chemokines, whereas the monocyte/macrophages develop oxidative stress and upregulate chemokine receptor. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is the type of NOS expressed in monocyte/macrophage and plays a critical role in physiopathological processes ranging from antimicrobial and wound healing to proinflammatory diseases. Expression of iNOS is negligible in resting cells and induced upon infection or metabolic stress, such as elevated levels of glucose and lipid (4Anavi S. Tirosh O. iNOS as a metabolic enzyme under stress conditions.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2020; 146: 16-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence strongly implies that iNOS-derived nitric oxide (NO) plays a central role in the regulation of lipid metabolism during inflammatory conditions (5Rosas-Ballina M. Guan X.L. Schmidt A. Bumann D. Classical activation of macrophages leads to lipid droplet formation without de novo fatty acid synthesis.Front Immunol. 2020; 11: 131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), resulting in endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, or hypertension (6Gliozzi M.

Mammalian integrins comprise 18 α and eight β subunits that constitute 24 heterodimers, which have been implicated in either acute (9Mezu-Ndubuisi O.J. Maheshwari A. The role of integrins in inflammation and angiogenesis.Pediatr. Res. 2021; 89: 1619-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or chronic metabolic inflammation (10Tian Y. Yang C. Yao Q. Qian L. Liu J. Xie X. et al.Procyanidin B2 activates PPARgamma to induce M2 polarization in mouse macrophages.Front Immunol. 2019; 10: 1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Integrin β1 serves a critical function in cell adhesion and occurs on numerous cells of the immune system (11Mrugacz M. Bryl A. Falkowski M. Zorena K. Integrins: an important link between angiogenesis, inflammation and eye diseases.Cells. 2021; 10: 1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The evidence that integrin α4β1 heterodimer modulates metabolic inflammation in obesity implies its role in leukocyte recruitment (12Chung K.J. Chatzigeorgiou A. Economopoulou M. Garcia-Martin R.

Integrin α4β1, presented on the leukocyte membrane, binds VCAM-1 on endothelial cells (13Gorina R. Lyck R. Vestweber D. Engelhardt B.

Rapid chemokine-increased integrin α4β1 affinity is required for monocyte arrest (15Hyduk S.J. Rullo J. Cano A.P. Xiao H. Chen M.

The lymphocyte homing receptors: gatekeepers of the multistep paradigm.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2005; 12: 444-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, integrin α4β1 can interact with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, contributing to vascular endothelial growth factor functions (17Gutierrez-Gonzalez A. Aguilera-Montilla N.

Integrin β1 expression is regulated during diverse pathophysiological processes including infection, tumorigenesis, and asthma (18Wang Y. Li K. Zhao W. Liu Z. Liu J.

A change in the expression of integrin receptors usually takes place at the transcription level. However, integrin β1 protein undergoes posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation (21Gahmberg C.G. Gronholm M. How integrin phosphorylations regulate cell adhesion and signaling.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2022; 47: 265-278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), acetylation (22Mirgorodskaya E. Dransart E. Shafaq-Zadah M. Roderer D. Sihlbom C. Leffler H. et al.Site-specific N-glycan profiles of alpha5 beta1 integrin from rat liver.Biol. Cell. 2022; 114: 160-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and ubiquitination (23Fan L. Zhang Y. Shi D. Xi R. Zhang Z. Wang X. Hypoxia enhances the cytotoxic effect of As4S4 on rat ventricular H9c2 cells through activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2021; 66: 126720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the other posttranslational modification of integrin β1 is limited. Protein S-nitrosylation is a redox sensitive reaction at cysteine residues by NO or NO-derived species to generate a S-nitrosothiol (24Chatterji A. Banerjee D. Billiar T.R. Sengupta R. Understanding the role of S-nitrosylation/nitrosative stress in inflammation and the role of cellular denitrosylases in inflammation modulation: implications in health and diseases.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2021; 172: 604-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Previous reports suggest that certain posttranslational modification may regulate protein ubiquitination and function. S-nitrosylation may promote or inhibit degradation of certain protein such as dihydrofolate reductase (25Cai Z. Lu Q. Ding Y. Wang Q. Xiao L. Song P. et al.Endothelial nitric oxide synthase-derived nitric oxide prevents dihydrofolate reductase degradation via promoting S-nitrosylation.Arterioscler Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2015; 35: 2366-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or TRIM72 (26Kohr M.J. Evangelista A.M. Ferlito M. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. S-nitrosylation of TRIM72 at cysteine 144 is critical for protection against oxidation-induced protein degradation and cell death.J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2014; 69: 67-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), respectively. S-nitrosylation of integrin α6 decreases its binding to laminin-β1 and increases the extent of prostate cancer cell migration (27Isaac J. Tarapore P. Zhang X. Lam Y.W. Ho S.M. Site-specific S-nitrosylation of integrin alpha6 increases the extent of prostate cancer cell migration by enhancing integrin beta1 association and weakening adherence to laminin-1.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 9689-9697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, whether integrin β1 could be regulated through S-nitrosylation remains as a critical question to understand its signaling transduction and function. In this study, we demonstrated that iNOS-generated NO stabilizes integrin β1 via S-nitrosylation, favorizing integrin α4β1 ligation and monocyte/macrophage adhesion to endothelium. Expression of iNOS is upregulated upon metabolic perturbation and considered as a marker of the classical and proinflammatory activation of macrophages (4Anavi S. Tirosh O. iNOS as a metabolic enzyme under stress conditions.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2020; 146: 16-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To investigate whether high level of FFA could induce inflammation in macrophages, Raw264.7 cells were subjected to FFA for the indicated times. FFA increased the levels of iNOS mRNA (Fig. 1A) and protein (Fig. 1B) 4 h after treatment. Then, the effect of FFA on NO production was examined in macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with FFA significantly augmented NO quantity in the conditioned media of macrophages. This result was further verified using an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrated that iNOS expression was upregulated by FFA in macrophages. iNOS plays a critical role in inflammatory progression, promoting us to evaluate its precise regulation on integrin β1. Raw264.7 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or two pairs of iNOS-specific siRNA. Both iNOS siRNAs markedly reduced iNOS protein compared to those transfected with scrambled siRNA, indicating their specificity. iNOS silencing reduced FFA-increased integrin β1 protein level compared to that of macrophages transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 2A). However, the integrin β1 mRNA level was not altered (Fig. 2B). Similar to the results of iNOS siRNA silencing, 1400W, a selective iNOS inhibitor, ablated FFA-induced integrin β1 expression (Fig. 2C). These data suggested that iNOS participated in FFA-increased integrin β1 protein level in macrophages. Next, we investigated the effect of iNOS-derived NO on integrin β1 expression. Raw264.7 cells were exposed to 2-Phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), a known NO scavenger. Treatment of macrophages with PTIO (60 μM and 120 μM) for 24 h abolished FFA-induced integrin β1 protein level (Fig. 2D) without affecting iNOS expression (Fig. S1). Exposure of macrophages to PTIO (60 μM) for 24 h significantly reduced FFA-induced integrin β1 (Fig. 2E). These data suggested that FFA-induced NO augmented integrin β1 protein level. Since both iNOS silencing and NO scavenging lowered integrin β1 protein without altering its transcription, we reasoned whether NO would modulate integrin β1 protein. As depicted in Fig. 3A, exposure of Raw264.7 cells to S-nitrosoglutathion (GSNO) or organic salt sodium nitroprusside (SNP), two NO donors, augmented integrin β1 protein level, which was abolished by a reductant N-acetyl-L-cysteinamide (NAC). Taken together, these results suggested that NO might modulate integrin β1 protein level via a redox-sensitive reaction, promoting us to examine whether integrin β1 could be modified by S- nitrosylation. Raw264.7 cells were exposed to GSNO or SNP for 4 h and then subjected to irreversible biotinylation procedure. Immunoblotting showed marked S-nitrosylation of integrin β1, which was abrogated by NAC treatment (Fig. 3B). These data suggested that integrin β1 could be S-nitrosylated. Experiments conducted in murine bone marrow–derived macrophages also confirmed that NO might modulate integrin β1 protein level (Fig. 3C) via a S-nitrosylation-dependent mechanism (Fig. 3D). Integrin β1 protein contains cysteine-rich tandem repeats which are crucial for its activation (28Eble J.A. de Rezende F.F. Redox-relevant aspects of the extracellular matrix and its cellular contacts via integrins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20: 1977-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 3E, three cysteine residues (Cys536, Cys555, and Cys568), highly conserved among species, were predicted as potential S-nitrosylated sites by using three different web-based tools (iSNO-PseACC, iSNO-AAPair, and PreSNO). To further confirm the function residue that undergo S-nitrosylation, we replaced the three corresponding cysteines in integrin β1 with alanine (C536A, C555A, and C568A) by using site-directed mutagenesis. The expression plasmids of the wildtype or mutated integrin β1 was transfected into HEK 293 cells and then treated with GSNO. We found that integrin β1 mutation at C555A, but not C536A or C568A abolished GNSO-induced S-nitrosylation (Fig. 3F), suggesting that S-nitrosylation modified integrin β1 predominantly at Cys555. Because iNOS inhibitor attenuated the FFA-stimulated increase in integrin β1 protein level without affecting its mRNA level (Fig. 2B), we studied the effect of NO on integrin β1 protein stability. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing integrin β1. Then the cells were exposed to GSNO after pretreated with cycloheximide (CHX), an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. As shown in Figure 4A, GSNO increased the half-life of integrin β1 protein. It is reported that integrin β1 degradation was mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl (23Fan L. Zhang Y. Shi D. Xi R. Zhang Z. Wang X. Hypoxia enhances the cytotoxic effect of As4S4 on rat ventricular H9c2 cells through activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system.J. Trace Elem. Med. Biol. 2021; 66: 126720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that the binding of c-Cbl to integrin β1 was largely diminished by GSNO treatment (Fig. 4B), which is consistent with the result of ubiquitination. As depicted in Figure 4C, GSNO decreased the detection of ubiquitinated integrin β1, suggesting that NO maintained integrin β1 stability by decreasing c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination. As increasement of integrin β1 protein level was dependent on iNOS-derived NO, we reasoned whether integrin β1 would be modified by S-nitrosylation. For this purpose, Raw264.7 and bone marrow–derived macrophages were exposed to FFA. Immunoblotting showed significant S-nitrosylation of integrin β1, which was abolished by NAC pretreatment (Fig. 5A). Similar with the result of GSNO, macrophages with FFA treatment after 24 h showed an increasement of integrin β1 protein level, which was ablated by NAC (Fig. 5B). These data suggested FFA could increase integrin β1 protein level via S-nitrosylation-dependent mechanism. We next examined whether iNOS silencing leads to integrin β1 reduction via ubiquitin-proteasome degradation. As shown in Figure 5C, MG132 ablated integrin β1 reduction caused by iNOS silencing. Similar with the results of GSNO, FFA treatment significantly inhibited integrin β1 degradation in the presence of CHX (Fig. 5D). Co-immunoprecipitation indicated that the binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl to integrin β1 was significantly decreased by FFA treatment (Fig. 5E), which was consistent that FFA decreased the ubiquitination level of integrin β1 (Fig. 5F). To confirm the effect of c-Cbl on integrin β1 degradation, Raw264.7 cells were primarily transfected with scrambled or c-Cbl siRNA, followed with FFA treatment. As depicted in Figure 5G, c-Cbl silencing further stabilized integrin β1 protein in FFA-treated macrophages. These data indicated that FFA augmented integrin β1 stability by reducing c-Cbl mediated ubiquitination. Given that integrins are obligate heterodimers and integrin α4 binds to integrin β1 in monocyte/macrophages (29Hyduk S.J. Chan J.R. Duffy S.T. Chen M. Peterson M.D. Waddell T.K. et al.Phospholipase C, calcium, and calmodulin are critical for alpha4beta1 integrin affinity up-regulation and monocyte arrest triggered by chemoattractants.Blood. 2007; 109: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we examined the modulation of integrin α4 and β1 by FFA. FFA did not alter their mRNA expression (Fig. 6, A and B). Protein level of integrin β1 was induced by FFA in a concentration- (Fig. 6C) and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6D). In contrast, the protein level of integrin α4 remained unchanged (Fig. 6, C and D). Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to examine the effect of FFA on integrin a4β1 dimerization. Their ligation was significantly enhanced in macrophages by FFA (Fig. 6E). Immunofluorescence staining on Raw274.7 cells confirmed that FFA upregulated integrin β1 protein level. Integrin α4 and β1 were localized on the surface of FFA-treated cells (Fig. 6F), suggesting that the formation of integrin α4β1 heterodimer on cellular membrane was increased by FFA in macrophages. To investigate the function and related mechanism of integrin β1 in macrophages, FFA-treated Raw264.7 cells were primarily transfected with integrin β1 or iNOS siRNA. Either integrin β1 (Fig. 7A) or iNOS (Fig. 7B) siRNA markedly reduced the number of adhering macrophages to endothelial cells compared to those transfected with scrambled siRNA. Similar to the effect of iNOS siRNA, selective iNOS inhibitor, 1400W, abolished the stimulatory effect of FFA on monocyte/macrophage-endothelial interaction (Fig. 7C). In parallel, NAC pretreatment decreased FFA-induced monocyte/macrophage adhesion (Fig. 7D). These results indicated that integrin β1 participated in FFA-induced monocyte/macrophage to endothelium via iNOS/NO-dependent S-nitrosylation. In this study, we revealed a novel modification of integrin β1, which is a key integrin subunit with essential roles in leukocyte extravascular migration and inflammatory responses. Here we demonstrated for the first time that elevated FFA triggered S-nitrosylation of integrin β1 in monocytes/macrophages. The decreased ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of integrin β1 enhanced monocyte–endothelial adhesion. Furthermore, these results provide mechanistic evidence that S-nitrosylation regulated the formation of a specific integrin heterodimer to mediate monocyte/macrophage adhesion to vascular endothelium. Integrins are essential for the survival and migratory capacity of inflammatory cells. Integrin β1 upregulation is a major mechanism for monocyte/macrophage adhesion, whereas its downregulation is crucial for cell migration and metastasis (30Shi L. Liu B. Shen D.D. Yan P. Zhang Y. Tian Y. et al.A tumor-suppressive circular RNA mediates uncanonical integrin degradation by the proteasome in liver cancer.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe5043Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, integrin β1 serves as a switch to control cellular motility and recruitment. Integrin β1+ macrophages are highly detectable in carotid plaques of the patients with hyperlipidemia or in atherosclerotic lesions of ApoE−/− mice (31Huang L.H. Melton E.M. Li H. Sohn P.

S-nitrosylation of integrin α6 at Cys86 decreases its binding to laminin-β1, leading to decreased cell adherence and increased motility in prostate cancer cells (27Isaac J. Tarapore P. Zhang X. Lam Y.W. Ho S.M. Site-specific S-nitrosylation of integrin alpha6 increases the extent of prostate cancer cell migration by enhancing integrin beta1 association and weakening adherence to laminin-1.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 9689-9697Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Exogenous NO modulates integrin αIIbβ3 activation via a S-nitrosylation-dependent mechanism (35Walsh G.M. Leane D. Moran N. Keyes T.E. Forster R.J. Kenny D. et al.S-Nitrosylation of platelet alphaIIbbeta3 as revealed by Raman spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6429-6436Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which integrin undergoing S-nitrosylation is largely unknown. Our current study provided a mechanistic explanation as to how integrin β1 promoted monocyte-endothelial adhesion via S-nitrosylation, ubiquitination, and degradation. This finding may shed new light on the mechanisms by which dyslipidemia-associated metabolic perturbation leads to meta-inflammation. Several studies suggest that posttranslational modifications are required for integrin β1 signaling transduction. Glycosylation protein controls integrin β1 activity and endocytic trafficking (22Mirgorodskaya E. Dransart E. Shafaq-Zadah M. Roderer D. Sihlbom C. Leffler H. et al.Site-specific N-glycan profiles of alpha5 beta1 integrin from rat liver.Biol. Cell. 2022; 114: 160-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of tyrosine 788 in integrin β1 promotes inside-out receptor activation (36Nilsson S. Kaniowska D. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Johansson S. Threonine 788 in integrin subunit beta1 regulates integrin activation.Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 844-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we found that S-nitrosylation inhibited integrin β1 degradation and triggers monocyte/macrophage adhesion to endothelium. It was reported in a redox proteome research that the Cys568 might be another potential cysteine residue undergoing S-nitrosylation in N-acetyl-p-aminophenol treated-hepatocytes (37Wojdyla K. Wrzesinski K. Williamson J. Fey S.J. Rogowska-Wrzesinska A. Acetaminophen-induced S-nitrosylation and S-sulfenylation signalling in 3D cultured hepatocarcinoma cell spheroids.Toxicol. Res. (Camb). 2016; 5: 905-920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Cys555 and Cys568 are conserved among mouse, human, and rat. They are contained within the cysteine-rich tandem repeats which form disulfide bridge. The disulfide bridge is required for recognition of α subunit and critical for the transition from its inactive to active form (28Eble J.A. de Rezende F.F. Redox-relevant aspects of the extracellular matrix and its cellular contacts via integrins.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2014; 20: 1977-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that S-nitrosylation of integrin β1 regulated its ligation with the α4 subunit. S-nitrosylation is reported to regulate protein ubiquitination and stability. Our research showed that S-nitrosylation decreased the binding between integrin β1 and E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl, thereby inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation. The mechanism by which S-nitrosylation prevents the interaction between integrin β1 and c-Cbl is to be investigated. A conformational change of integrin β1 might prevent recognition and subsequent attachment of ubiquitin. Other E3 ligases, such as Fbx2, are also involved in integrin β1 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation (30Shi L. Liu B. Shen D.D. Yan P. Zhang Y. Tian Y. et al.A tumor-suppressive circular RNA mediates uncanonical integrin degradation by the proteasome in liver cancer.Sci. Adv. 2021; 7eabe5043Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Integrin β1 has been shown to be ubiquitinated, internalized, and degraded by the lysosome, a typical degradation pathway for transmembrane proteins (38Bottcher R.T. Stremmel C. Meves A. Meyer H. Widmaier M. Tseng H.Y. et al.Sorting nexin 17 prevents lysosomal degradation of beta1 integrins by binding to the beta1-integrin tail.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 584-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, we found in this study that iNOS-derived NO prevented integrin β1 from proteasome-dependent degradation. It is tempting to speculate that the S-nitrosylation may mediate an unusual process for substrate recognition by the proteasome. Integrin are heterodimers of α and β subunits, which are strictly ligated upon extracellular stimuli and required for its downstream signaling activation. The mechanism of integrin dimerization has not been well-understood. C1q-containing immune complexes is required for integrin α2β1 ligation in mast cells during innate immunity (39McCall-Culbreath K.D. Li Z. Zutter M.M.

The role of several transcription factors and signaling pathways have been characterized during maintenance of human naive pluripotency. However, little is known about the role exerted by the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its three-dimensional (3D) organization. Here, using an unbiased and integrated approach combining microfluidic cultures with transcriptional, proteomic, and secretome analyses, we found that naive, but not primed, hiPSC colonies are characterized by a self-organized ECM-rich microenvironment. Based on this, we developed a 3D culture system that supports robust long-term feeder-free self-renewal of naive hiPSCs and also allows direct and timely developmental morphogenesis simply by modulating the signaling environment. Our study opens new perspectives for future applications of naive hiPSCs to study critical stages of human development in 3D starting from a single cell."

The research methods in this paper include entropy weight technique method for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution, coupling coordination degree model, Dagum Gini coefficient and decomposition method, Moran’s I index, σ convergence model and β convergence model. The study found that the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions in China has been continuously improved and has obvious regional and stage characteristics, but it is still on the verge of imminent disorder; the overall difference in the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions shows a decreasing and then increasing trend, the main source of which is inter-regional differences; the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions has a positive spatial correlation; except for the Southern Coastal Economic Zone and the Middle Yangtze River Economic Zone, there is no significant σ-convergence and β-convergence in the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions system in other economic zones; the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions changes fastest in the Middle Yangtze River Economic Zone. The innovation of this paper is to measure the coupling coordination degree of energy-economy-carbon emissions and to analyse its regional differences and spatial effects.

However, the wild harvested edible insects’ value chain faces several challenges including limited knowledge on indigenous practices in the harvesting and processing and lack of information on roles of the different actors in the chain. A case study of Gonimbrasia belina , colloquially referred to as the ’mopane worm’, was conducted to understand and identify determinants of participation in the value chain of the edible caterpillar. A cross sectional study was conducted in Gwanda (a rural district in Zimbabwe) to (a) understand the indigenous knowledge on harvesting and processing methods, (b) explore value addition and the traditional beliefs surrounding the utilisation of the mopane worm. Results showed that consumers (81.7%), and harvesters (76.6%) were the main actors in the mopane worm value chain. Using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, the following were shown to be determinants of participation in the mopane worm value chain: (a) gender (b) household size (c) marital status (d) religion and (e) household assets. Two primary processing methods of harvested mopane worm were distinguished i.e., boiling and roasting on ambers. Results showed lack of diversity in mopane worm-based products.

It has also been observed that the suicide rate in BD patients is higher than in the general population, and more recently the telomere length variation has been described as shorter in suicide completers compared with control subjects. Objectives The aim of the present study was to investigate if there is an association between LTL and BD in families where two or more members have BD including clinical symptomatology variables, along with suicide behavior. Methods Telomere length and single copy gene ratio (T/S ratio) was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a sample of 143 relatives from 22 families, of which 60 had BD. The statistical analysis was performed with a polygenic mixed model. Results LTL was associated with suicidal ideation (p = 0.02) as that there is an interaction between suicidal ideation and course of the disorder (p = 0.02). The estimated heritability for LTL in these families was 0.68. In addition, covariates that relate to severity of disease, i.e. suicidal ideation and course of the disorder, showed an association with shorter LTL in BD patients. No difference in LTL between BD patients and healthy relatives was observed. Conclusion LTL are shorter in subjects with familial BD suggesting that stress related sub-phenotypes possibly accelerate the process of cellular aging and correlate with disease severity and suicidal ideation."

DL is a machine learning method that uses neural networks to learn complex rules that make predictions about diverse types of data. When DL models are trained to predict genomic data from DNA sequence information, their high prediction accuracy allows the identification of impactful genetic variants within and across species. In addition, the learned sequence rules can be extracted from the model and provide important clues about the mechanistic underpinnings of the cis-regulatory code. A sought-after goal of the gene regulation field is to decode enhancer grammar (1Zeitlinger J. Seven myths of how transcription factors read the cis-regulatory code.Curr. Opin. Syst. Biol. 2020; 23: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). How do transcription factor (TF) binding motifs within an enhancer combine to generate its unique activity? Can we learn the enhancer grammar to create synthetic spatially or temporally regulated enhancers? The great advantage of deep learning (DL) models over traditional methods is that they learn complex cis-regulatory rules in a precise and unbiased manner, allowing for new sequence rules to be discovered. Identifying these rules is done after model training and is not trivial; yet, a variety of interpretation tools already exist to obtain the important sequence features and their rules of interactions. In this manner, DL models reliably reveal the binding motifs of TFs and provide important clues as to how the motifs combine to produce an experimental outcome. Interpreting DL models can therefore reveal novel mechanistic insights that can then be tested experimentally. For example, Alexander Stark (IMP, Vienna) discussed his laboratory’s recent application of DL to their STARR-seq method to predict enhancer activity from DNA sequence (2de Almeida B.P. Reiter F. Pagani M. Stark A. DeepSTARR predicts enhancer activity from DNA sequence and enables the de novo design of synthetic enhancers.Nat. Genet. 2022; 54: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). DeepSTARR can be successfully used to design synthetic enhancers with desired activities. Julia Zeitlinger (Stowers Institute) described her laboratory’s work on applying DL to understand the cis-regulatory rules of enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis. Using BPNet (3Avsec Z. Weilert M. Shrikumar A. Alexandari A. Krueger S. Dalal K. et al.Deep learning at base-resolution reveals motif syntax of the cis-regulatory code.BioRxiv. 2020; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/737981Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and chromBPNet as DL models, they uncovered TF cooperativity and sequences critical to opening chromatin, revealing a different effect for high versus low affinity motifs. Shaun Mahony (Pennsylvania State University) also explored the mechanistic basis of chromatin accessibility by studying the evolutionary impacts of FOX gene paralogs (4Srivastava D. Aydin B. Mazzoni E.O. Mahony S. An interpretable bimodal neural network characterizes the sequence and preexisting chromatin predictors of induced transcription factor binding.Genome Biol. 2021; 22: 20Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Their DL approach specifically modeled chromatin state and DNA sequence to predict whether individual paralogs required prior chromatin accessibility for binding. Several talks focused on further improving our ability to extract cis-regulatory information from DL models. Sara Mostafavi (University of Washington) talked about her approaches to identify sequence features important for determining chromatin states in diverse human immune cells. She discussed approaches to unlock elements in the DL algorithms that were informative and reproducible, including identifying the number of active motifs found at diverse enhancers (5Novakovsky G. Dexter N. Libbrecht M.W. Wasserman W.W. Mostafavi S. Obtaining genetics insights from deep learning via explainable artificial intelligence.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41576-022-00532-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Vivekanandan Ramalingam (Kundaje laboratory; Stanford University) illustrated how the Kundaje laboratory extracts important DNA sequences from a DL model to identify the distance rules by which TF motifs cooperate in binding and opening chromatin (3Avsec Z. Weilert M. Shrikumar A. Alexandari A. Krueger S. Dalal K. et al.Deep learning at base-resolution reveals motif syntax of the cis-regulatory code.BioRxiv. 2020; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/737981Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). He also shared dynseq, a browser tool for visually exploring the sequences that were learned by a DL model (6Nair S. Barrett A. Li D. Raney B.J. Lee B.T. Kerpedjiev P. et al.The dynseq browser track shows context-specific features at nucleotide resolution.Nat. Genet. 2022; 54: 1581-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). These examples highlight the importance of further tool development for motif identification and functional contributions to enhancer activity. A strength of DL models is that they can learn sequence rules in an unbiased manner. Reassuringly, the learned rules can often be matched to known processes involved in gene regulation. For example, the learned TF binding motifs and their affinities correspond remarkably well to biophysical models of TF binding. Therefore, an important goal is to combine DL with biophysical models of transcription. Along this line, Justin Kinney (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) discussed Mave-NN, a computational framework for integration of diverse gene expression data to make DL accessible to a biological user base (7Tareen A. Kooshkbaghi M. Posfai A. Ireland W.T. McCandlish D.M. Kinney J.B. MAVE-NN: Learning genotype-phenotype maps from multiplex assays of variant effect.Genome Biol. 2022; 23: 98Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These biophysical models will illuminate the functional properties of gene switches such as those studied using optogenetic technology by Hernan Garcia (UC Berkeley) in the Drosophila embryo (8Zhao J. Lammers N.C. Alamos S. Kim Y.J. Martini G. Garcia H.G. Optogenetic dissection of transcriptional repression in a multicellular organism.BioRxiv. 2022; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.20.517211Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Since sequence information plays a central role in the fields of gene regulation, development, and evolution, sequence-centered DL models are an excellent way to promote cross-fertilization between these fields, which was the overarching theme for this American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (ASBMB)-sponsored conference. Evolution is a crucial trove of knowledge for understanding gene regulation, and conversely, an understanding of gene regulation is a key to unlocking evolutionary processes. Deep learning can therefore have a significant impact toward accelerating this dialogue between fields. One path forward is to integrate the sequence information extracted from DL models with other data modalities to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs). For example, to characterize key players in zebrafish inner ear regeneration, Erin Jimenez (Shawn Burgess laboratory; NIH) used single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to identify activated enhancers during regeneration. Using DL, she uncovered a role for the Sox and Six TFs in coordinately regulating ear regeneration (9Jimenez E. Slevin C.C. Song W. Chen Z. Frederickson S.C. Gildea D. et al.A regulatory network of Sox and Six transcription factors initiate a cell fate transformation during hearing regeneration in adult zebrafish.Cell Genomics. 2022; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This and other studies illustrate how DL approaches can facilitate the molecular identification of GRNs and increase the power of traditional genetic and genomic studies for biomedical research. The high prediction accuracy of DL models can also be leveraged without understanding the learned sequence rules. When DL models are trained to predict a readout such as ATAC-seq accessibility, the high prediction accuracy holds for similar sequences, including genetic variants within a population or across related species. This makes DL models ideal for the identification of causal genetic variants and has the potential to identify genes and alleles underlying the evolution of complex phenotypes such as mammalian brain size. This extremely challenging problem was tackled by Irene Kaplow (Andreas Pfenning laboratory; Carnegie Mellon University) by training a DL model on ATAC-seq data from several well-characterized mammalian brains (10Kaplow I.M. Schäffer D.E. Wirthlin M.E. Lawler A.J. Brown A.R. Kleyman M. et al.Inferring mammalian tissue-specific regulatory conservation by predicting tissue-specific differences in open chromatin.BMC Genomics. 2022; 23: 291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Her model, TACIT, allowed the identification of several motor cortex enhancers that are associated with the evolution of brain size relative to body size. This work paves the way for using deep learning to identify enhancers and candidate genes involved in complex traits that are subject to evolutionary selection. Species- and population-level variation was also the subject of DL analysis by Michael Wilson (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto) who applied the BPNet model to mouse liver TFs and showed how it could predict TF binding profiles in other mammalian species. In addition, his laboratory applied this model to interpret variations related to disease-causing alleles involved in blood coagulation and lipid regulation. Such use of DL models is poised to influence and complement the current genetic approaches used to map and understand the impact of cis-regulatory sequence variation. Excellent examples were the talks from Drs Brem, Vierbuchen, Wunderlich, Fay, and Wittkopp. Using a mouse fibroblast senescence model, Rachel Brem’s laboratory at UC Berkeley used a classic F1 hybrid approach to identify cis-regulatory changes between two mouse species that explains their differential response to irradiation. Their analysis highlighted the TF USF2, which may play a role in senescence decision-making. Similarly, Thomas Vierbuchen (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center) described the use of mouse hybrid cells to link cis-regulatory variation with TF binding and enhancer function in the context of mouse embryonic and brain development. Zeba Wunderlich (Boston University) studied distinct populations and hybrids of Drosophila melanogaster to understand how population-level variation impacts the innate immune response to infection. Her laboratory found that trans-acting alleles dominate the response to a Gram-negative infection, while cis-acting effects dominate in a Gram-positive infection. A similar population variation approach was used by the laboratory of Justin Fay (University of Rochester) to identify protein-based variation linked to thermal tolerance in different species of yeast. They identified numerous differences in protein stability and also an important role of the hybrid cellular environment. Patricia Wittkopp (University of Michigan) described her laboratory’s classical genetic approaches to empirically test the assumption that trans-acting variants are more pleiotropic than cis-acting variants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By comparing the impact of cis- and trans-acting mutations on fitness and gene expression, their highly quantitative assays revealed differences in the effects of these two classes of mutations that support the hypothesis that trans-regulatory mutations are more pleiotropic than cis (11Vande Zande P. Hill M.S. Wittkopp P.J. Pleiotropic effects of trans-regulatory mutations on fitness and gene expression.Science. 2022; 377: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The influence of genetic variation can also be studied at the organismal level. Nicolas Rohner (Stowers Institute) described work in his laboratory using Mexican cavefish, which independently underwent metabolic adaptation to the cave environment multiple times. His team combined ‘omics datasets from livers of surface and cave morphs to identify putative cis-regulatory changes that alter target genes and pathways directly involved in cave adaptation (12Krishnan J. Seidel C.W. Zhang N. Singh N.P. VanCampen J. Peuß R. et al.Genome-wide analysis of cis-regulatory changes underlying metabolic adaptation in cavefish.Nat. Genet. 2022; 54: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Such a dissection of cis-regulatory evolution was also explored by Phillip Davidson (Armin Moczek laboratory; Indiana University Bloomington) using dung beetles. These beetles have sexually dimorphic horn development, and in some species, males develop horns in response to nutritional cues. Davidson explored the cis-regulatory basis of this developmental plasticity using ‘omics approaches and identified enhancers that may be responsible for nutritional and sex-responsive differential development. In these studies, identification of relevant cis-regulatory changes relied on current molecular biological tools including ATAC-seq. It is intriguing to consider how DL approaches may complement this objective in the future. Using DL models to obtain insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation should be a welcome addition to the current purely experimental approaches. For example, Evgeny Kvon (UC Irvine) used chromatin conformation capture technology to map enhancer-promoter interactions for thousands of validated mouse enhancers (13Chen Z. Snetkova V. Bower G. Jacinto S. Clock B. Barozzi I. et al.Widespread increase in enhancer-promoter interactions during developmental enhancer activation in Mammals.BioRxiv. 2022; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.18.516017Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). They concluded that most enhancer-promoter loops are tissue specific and are significantly stronger when enhancers are active. Similarly, Tathagata Biswas (Nicolas Rohner laboratory; Stowers Institute) shared his work looking at global chromosomal architecture. These studies make inferences about critical 3D genome interactions that may differ between populations of cavefish. Since DL models can be trained to predict Hi-C data from sequence, these are areas that could benefit from an integrative approach using both DL and targeted experiments. Several talks at the meeting leveraged the interplay between evolutionary changes and mechanistic insights into gene regulation. By taking evolutionary changes as a starting point, they used classical experimental approaches to uncover specific functions of enhancers, insulators, histone proteins, and TFs, sometimes at the level of a single locus. For instance, Mark Rebeiz (University of Pittsburgh) described elegant experiments dissecting evolutionary transformations at the ebony locus, where silencers have been systematically reshaped to impact pigmentation in specific Drosophila species. Likewise, Nicolas Gompel (Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich) used the Drosophila pigmentation system to revisit the notion of enhancer modularity at the yellow locus. Through analysis of wing spot pigmentation in a number of species, his laboratory showed how regulatory regions of this gene exhibit multifunctionality and partial redundancy that evolved over time. Dimple Notani (National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore) discussed her laboratory’s studies on estrogen-driven gene regulation, where clusters of enhancers appear to act in a cooperative fashion to drive gene expression. Some elements are prebound to the estrogen receptor prior to signaling. Others are induced and appear to require “driver” enhancers for activity. Notably, these elements are not functionally distinguishable based on previously measured chromatin properties. Exploring evolutionary variation at the protein level, talks by Pravrutha Raman (Harmit Malik laboratory; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center), David Arnosti (Michigan State University), and Pinar Onal (Shelby Blythe laboratory; Northwestern University) focused on particular TFs and their evolution. Pravrutha Raman’s work examines the variability in histone proteins over evolutionary time. She found that ancestral histone variants H2A.X and H2A.Z are found to have fused to form a composite gene, H2A.V in many Diptera. Interestingly, some Drosophila have duplicated the H2A.V variant, with the duplicates expressed in males, indicating that evolutionary innovations in histone proteins may drive biological novelties. David Arnosti’s talk about evolution of the C-terminal Binding Protein also investigated how this core component of the transcriptional apparatus has evolved in eukaryotes (14Raicu A.M. Kadiyala D. Niblock M. Jain A. Yang Y. Bird K.M. et al.The cynosure of CtBP: Evolution of a bilaterian transcriptional corepressor.BioRxiv. 2022; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.23.497424Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Deep phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the intrinsically disordered C terminus bears a surprising level of conservation of short linear motifs, dating back to its earliest last common bilaterian ancestor. Evolution of the Bicoid TF was discussed by Pinar Onal, who specifically focused on the role of the Bicoid DNA-binding domain. In testing ancestral forms of this protein in the Drosophila embryo, she was able to replay the evolutionary history of this domain as Bicoid duplicated and evolved (15Onar P. Gunasinghe H.I. Umezawa K.Y. Zheng M. Ling J. Azeez L. et al.Suboptimal intermediates underlie evolution of the bicoid homeodomain.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2021; 38: 2179-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These focused individual studies demonstrate that learning general rules for gene regulation using DL models should inspire, but not replace, the focus on specific biological problems. Like individual works of art, biological systems need to be considered in their own right. Many aspects by which they operate represent highly specialized solutions to specific organismal challenges. As a result, highly complex combinations of molecular components, such as the HOX gene cluster, are often unique and may only be represented once in a genome (Fig. 1). Thus, while DL innovations are ripe for application to the fields of gene regulation, development, and evolution, they do not replace the unique perspective that individual studies bring. The meeting brought together experimental and computational biologists, whose goal is to uncover how gene expression is regulated in the context of evolution. In particular, there was a focus on how DL models can impact the study of gene regulation, development, and evolution (Fig. 1). DL models can be interpreted to identify complex sequence rules that underlie TF binding, enhancer function, open chromatin regions, global chromosomal architecture, and key players in a GRN. These rules can then be tested and explored further using targeted experiments. DL models can also be exploited to make accurate predictions about genetic variation, which together with experimental approaches can help uncover enhancers and target genes involved in specific biological processes and complex phenotypes. Thus, DL models have the potential to become important tools among experimentalists, thereby accelerating unique insights into biological systems.

Previous neutron crystallography detected both the neutral BV and its protonated form (BVH+) in the wildtype (WT) PcyA-BV complex, and a nearby catalytic residue Asp105 was found to have two conformations (protonated and deprotonated). Semiempirical calculations have suggested that the protonation states of BV are reflected in the absorption spectrum of the WT PcyA-BV complex. In the previously determined absorption spectra of the PcyA D105N and I86D mutants, complexed with BV, a peak at 730 nm, observed in the WT, disappeared and increased, respectively. Here, we performed neutron crystallography and quantum chemical analysis of the D105N-BV and I86D-BV complexes to determine the protonation states of BV and the surrounding residues and study the correlation between the absorption spectra and protonation states around BV. Neutron structures elucidated that BV in the D105N mutant is in a neutral state, whereas that in the I86D mutant is dominantly in a protonated state. Glu76 and His88 showed different hydrogen bonding with surrounding residues compared with WT PcyA, further explaining why D105N and I86D have much lower activities for phycocyanobilin synthesis than the WT PcyA. Our quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations of the absorption spectra showed that the spectral change in D105N arises from Glu76 deprotonation, consistent with the neutron structure. Collectively, our findings reveal more mechanistic details of bilin pigment biosynthesis."

Previous structural analysis has revealed that most pathogenic amino acid substitutions map to the three main points of contact between eEF2 and critical large subunit rRNA elements of the ribosome, specifically to contacts with Helix 69, Helix 95, also known as the sarcin-ricin loop, and Helix 43 of the GTPase-associated center. In order to further investigate these eEF2–ribosome interactions, we identified a series of yeast eEF2 amino acid residues based on their proximity to these functionally important rRNA elements. Based on this analysis, we constructed mutant strains to sample the full range of amino acid sidechain biochemical properties, including acidic, basic, nonpolar, and deletion (alanine) residues. These were characterized with regard to their effects on cell growth, sensitivity to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, and translational fidelity. We also biophysically characterized one mutant from each of the three main points of contact with the ribosome using CD. Collectively, our findings from these studies identified functionally critical contacts between eEF2 and the ribosome. The library of eEF2 mutants generated in this study may serve as an important resource for biophysical studies of eEF2/ribosome interactions going forward.

The library of eEF2 mutants generated in this study may serve as an important resource for biophysical studies of eEF2/ribosome interactions going forward. Protein synthesis (translation) is a core cellular process. At its heart is the ribosome, a universally conserved, two subunit poly-amino acid polymerase that decodes the genetic information encoded in mRNAs into proteins. Once initiated on an mRNA, the ribosome proceeds through a cyclic function called elongation, which is facilitated by two trans-acting factors: 1) a ternary complex consisting of elongation factor 1 (EF-Tu in prokaryotes, eEF1A in eukaryotes) complexed with an aminoacyl-tRNA and GTP and 2) a translocase consisting of elongation factor 2·GTP (EF-G·GTP and eEF2·GTP, respectively). The ternary complex delivers new amino acids to the nascent peptide chain on the ribosome, after which the translocase moves the ribosome down the mRNA in the 3′ direction by one codon in a process called translocation. During translocation, the tRNAs in the P/E and A/P hybrid states fully shift to the E and P sites on both subunits, respectively, and the small subunit moves one codon in the 3′ direction positioning its unoccupied A site to decode the next codon. While inherent ribosome rotations are able to translocate without catalysis, the presence of eEF2·GTP increases the rate by 104-fold (1Gavrilova L.P. Kostiashkina O.E. Koteliansky V.E. Rutkevitch N.M. Spirin A.S. Factor-free (“Non-enzymic”) and factor-dependent systems of translation of polyuridylic acid by Escherichia coli ribosomes.J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 537-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It does so by accommodating into the A site and inducing ribosomal conformation changes that accelerate the process. Because of its necessity for efficient translocation, eEF2 may play a role in accurately decoding an mRNA, referred to as translational fidelity. As the ribosomal contacts with the tRNA–mRNA complex are reoriented during translocation, it presents the most vulnerable state for slippage of the ribosome into an aberrant reading frame, that is, frameshifting. eEF2 is thought to not only enhance the speed of translocation but its accuracy as well. Indeed, structural studies have suggested that a unique diphthamide posttranslational modification acts as a “pawl” that prevents the ribosome from slipping out of frame during translocation (2Ortiz P.A. Ulloque R. Kihara G.K. Zheng H. Kinzy T.G. Translation elongation factor 2 anticodon mimicry domain mutants affect fidelity and diphtheria toxin resistance.J.Biol.Chem. 2006; 281: 32639-32648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as well as “unlocking” the codon–anticodon complex from the decoding center, thereby breaking the hold the ribosome has on the tRNA–mRNA complex (3Pellegrino S. Demeshkina N. Mancera-Martinez E. Melnikov S. Simonetti A. Myasnikov A. et al.Structural insights into the role of diphthamide on elongation factor 2 in mRNA reading-frame maintenance.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430: 2677-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Additionally, the recent elucidation of a chimeric elongation complex without EF-G demonstrated that in its absence, tRNA and mRNA movement become uncoupled (4Zhou J. Lancaster L. Donohue J.P. Noller H.F. Spontaneous ribosomal translocation of mRNA and tRNAs into a chimeric hybrid state.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 7813-7818Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and it has been shown that EF-G also accelerates conformational changes that secure the new ribosomal contacts with the tRNA–mRNA complex after the completion of translocation (5Flis J. Holm M. Rundlet E.J. Loerke J. Hilal T. Dabrowski M. et al.tRNA translocation by the eukaryotic 80S ribosome and the impact of GTP hydrolysis.Cell Rep. 2018; 25: 2676-2688.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Given the centrality of translation, it was long believed that mutations in components of the translational apparatus would be incompatible with successful completion of highly coordinated and complex vertebrate developmental programs. This view was challenged with the discovery that Diamond-Blackfan Anemia is caused by mutations in a ribosomal protein (6Draptchinskaia N. Gustavsson P. Andersson B. Pettersson M. Willig T.N. Dianzani I. et al.The gene encoding ribosomal protein S19 is mutated in Diamond-Blackfan anaemia.Nat.Genet. 1999; 21: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). With the advent of improved sequencing technologies, the list of “ribosomopathies” has continued to expand: the current list of mutations responsible for this class of disorders includes genes encoding ribosomal proteins, ribosome biogenesis factors, and posttranscriptional rRNA-modification complexes (7Kampen K.R. Sulima S.O. Vereecke S. de Keersmaecker K. Hallmarks of ribosomopathies.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Ribosomopathies can manifest as a variety of phenotypes, all characterized by developmental defects due to cell hypoproliferation, including anemia and/or craniofacial malformations (8Narla A. Ebert B.L. Ribosomopathies: human disorders of ribosome dysfunction.Blood. 2010; 115: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 9De Keersmaecker K. Sulima S.O. Dinman J.D. Ribosomopathies and the paradox of cellular hypo- to hyperproliferation.Blood. 2015; 125: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Confoundingly, this class of patients are also more susceptible to various cancers later in life, indicating that there is a cellular transition from a hypoproliferative state to a hyperproliferative one (9De Keersmaecker K. Sulima S.O. Dinman J.D. Ribosomopathies and the paradox of cellular hypo- to hyperproliferation.Blood. 2015; 125: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This switch, known as “Damashek’s Riddle” (10Dameshek W. Riddle: what do aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and “hypoplastic” leukemia have in common?.Blood. 1967; 30: 251-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is thought to be driven by a Darwinian process that selects for secondary mutations that bypass the decreased fitness caused by the original ribosomopathic mutation (9De Keersmaecker K. Sulima S.O. Dinman J.D. Ribosomopathies and the paradox of cellular hypo- to hyperproliferation.Blood. 2015; 125: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since translation relies on many interacting molecules besides the ribosome, it is possible that mutations to—or biogenesis defects in—other components of the translational apparatus could also result in disease. Accordingly, in tandem with the increased availability of patient genome sequencing, a growing list of genes either directly involved in or adjacent to translation have been implicated in genetic disorders. These include mutations in tRNA processing (6Draptchinskaia N. Gustavsson P. Andersson B. Pettersson M. Willig T.N.

A comparison of pathogenic eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2) variants in Spinocerebellar ataxia 26 versus de dovo mutations.Cureus. 2022; 14e26857Google Scholar). These “translationopathies” tend to share common clinical features including developmental abnormalities and neurological defects and, on a molecular level, loss of translational fidelity (24Kapur M. Ackerman S.L. mRNA translation gone awry: translation fidelity and neurological disease.Trends Genet. 2018; 34: 218-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a largely heterogenous group of genetic diseases characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, leading to loss of muscle coordination and a variety of other symptoms (25Manto M. The wide spectrum of Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs).Cerebellum. 2005; 4: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Each of the 31 different subtypes of SCA result from mutations at distinct genetic loci, indicating that Purkinje neurons, which form the cortex of the cerebellum, are particularly susceptible to genetic defects. These neurons appear to be more sensitive to proteotoxic stress than other cell types, presumably due to their large size, branched morphology, and their susceptibility to being overloaded by misfolded proteins (26Allan Drummond D. Wilke C.O. The evolutionary consequences of erroneous protein synthesis.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The autosomal dominant disorder Spinocerebellar ataxia 26 (SCA26) is caused by mutation of proline at position 596 to histidine (P596H) in the gene encoding eEF2, which results in increased frequency of translational errors (17Hekman K.E. Yu G.Y. Brown C.D. Zhu H. Du X. Gervin K. et al.A conserved eEF2 coding variant in SCA26 leads to loss of translational fidelity and increased susceptibility to proteostatic insult.Hum.Mol.Genet. 2012; 21: 5472-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that eEF2-P596H causes cerebellar degeneration by disrupting translational fidelity, resulting in accumulation of misfolded proteins (i.e., proteotoxic stress) and degeneration of Purkinje neurons. Additional patients harboring novel eEF2 mutations have been identified (27Nabais Sá M.J. Olson A.N. Yoon G. Nimmo G.A.M. Gomez C.M. Willemsen M.A. et al.De novo variants in EEF2 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with benign external hydrocephalus.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2021; 29: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In contrast to P596H, these eEF2 mutations including V28M, C372Y, and H769Y were associated with neurodevelopmental delays and cranial abnormalities, indicating that eEF2 mutations have wider-reaching pathologies than SCA26. Structural analysis revealed that almost all of these pathogenic amino acid substitutions map to the three main points of contact between eEF2 and critical rRNA elements of the ribosome. Specifically, the eEF2 mutant P596H mapped to contacts with H69, V28M with the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL, H95), and H769Y with H43 of the GTPase-associated center, all of the large subunit (LSU) of the ribosome (Fig. 1). Each of these ribosomal sites are highly conserved and have been implicated in various functions. The GTPase-associated center is responsible for activating the GTPase activity of translation factors, while the SRL is involved in linking GTP hydrolysis to ribosome conformational changes. H69 is part of the intersubunit bridge, which helps to link the large and small subunits of the ribosome and interacts with several translation factors and tRNA in the A site. They have each been implicated as having functions in translocation, but the relevance of their interactions with eEF2 are not well understood. In the current study, a large number of yeast eEF2 mutants were generated based on their proximity to these functionally important rRNA elements in order to further investigate the contributions of these eEF2–ribosome interactions to translational fidelity. The targeted residues were constructed as to test the biochemical contributions of amino acid side chains, including size, charge and polarity on cell growth, viability, sensitivity to translational inhibitors, and translational fidelity. The effects of a subset of mutants on gross eEF2 structure and ribosome-stimulated GTPase activity were also preliminarily investigated. EFT2 mutant yeast strains were generated from a parent strain in which the endogenous EFT1 and EFT2 genes were disrupted and replaced by a centromeric plasmid encoding either WT or mutant EFT2 under control of its endogenous promoter. Standard auxotrophic and 5-FOA–driven plasmid shuffle methods were used to select for cells expressing the eEF2 mutants. This method also enabled the identification of lethal mutants of this essential protein (Fig. 2A). For each of the three rRNA interaction sites, there was at least one amino acid to which substitutions were particularly deleterious. Three out of the four mutations to V28 in the SRL-interacting site, V28F, V28K, and V28D, substitutions were lethal, suggesting that sidechain length rather than charge properties are most important at this position. A similar trend was observed for residue 66. Conversely, charge appeared to be the critical criterion at residue 785. For the H69 residues, all substitutions of S579 were lethal, while almost all substitutions to P580 were tolerated. Mutations of amino acids that interact with H43 interactions appeared to be less deleterious overall, but two substitutions at S756 were inviable. Other residues were able to tolerate all but one substitution, including R66D and R785A of the SRL-proximal residues and P580T of the H69 group. Growth rates of the viable yeast strains were first determined to begin characterizing the global effects of these eEF2 mutations (Fig. 2B). Most mutations conferred small decreases in growth rates, resulting in a marginally longer doubling times. Several positions proximal to the SRL appeared to increase the doubling times to a greater extent, including R66A, R66F, and L536A. Of the single remaining H69-interacting residue, only P580F exhibited more than a 2-fold increase in doubling time. Of the amino acids that interact with H43, only Q753A significantly affected doubling time. In order to probe the effect of eEF2 mutations on critical sites of interaction between eEF2 and the ribosome, cellular growth in the presence of sublethal concentrations of ribosome-targeting translational inhibitors were assayed (Fig. 3). Hygromycin B and paromomycin are aminoglycosides that bind to rRNA near the decoding center in the A site of the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) (Fig. 3A). Specifically, paromomycin stabilizes the binding of near-cognate tRNAs in the A site, inducing missense incorporation and inhibiting translocation, while hygromycin B also stabilizes A site tRNA as well as interfering with the conformational changes associated with rotation of the ribosome (28Belardinelli R. Sharma H. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Perturbation of ribosomal subunit dynamics by inhibitors of tRNA translocation.RNA. 2021; 27: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 29Wintermeyer W. Translocation on the ribosome.in: Encyclopedia of Biophysics. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg2013: 2650-2655Crossref Google Scholar). Anisomycin binds the peptidyltransferase center in the A site of the LSU (Fig. 3A), where it destabilizes aa-tRNA binding and inhibits peptidyl transfer (27Nabais Sá M.J. Olson A.N. Yoon G. Nimmo G.A.M. Gomez C.M. Willemsen M.A. et al.De novo variants in EEF2 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with benign external hydrocephalus.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2021; 29: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 28Belardinelli R. Sharma H. Peske F. Rodnina M.V. Perturbation of ribosomal subunit dynamics by inhibitors of tRNA translocation.RNA. 2021; 27: 981-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cycloheximide binds to the LSU E site (Fig. 3A) competing with deacylated tRNA and inhibiting the movement of the P site tRNA into the E site during translocation (30Garreau de Loubresse N. Prokhorova I. Holtkamp W. Rodnina M.V. Yusupova G. Yusupov M. Structural basis for the inhibition of the eukaryotic ribosome.Nature. 2014; 513: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). By measuring the doubling times of the eEF2 variants in the presence of these translation inhibitors, the degree to which the difference between the WT and mutant changes between normal and inhibited growth can be compared, indicating how specific mutations may alter the functional interactions between eEF2 and the ribosome. As shown in Figure 3B (and Table S6), inhibitors hygromycin B and paromomycin tended to slow the growth rate of the mutant strains, with some being unable to survive at the concentrations used. This indicates that most of the mutants functionally perturb the interactions between eEF2 and the decoding center. Anisomycin had little to no effects, consistent with the lack of interactions between eEF2 and the peptidyltransferase center A site. Most of the mutants conferred at least some degree of resistance to cycloheximide, consistent with the roles played by movement of deacylated tRNA into the E site prior to translocation. The ribosome interaction sites also tended to confer distinct profiles, with the residues that interact with the SRL and H69 showing the strongest differences. For the SRL proximal site, all R66 mutants were inviable in the presence of paromomycin, and R66F and L536A were inviable with both aminoglycosides. V28A also demonstrated sensitivity to both drugs, while the L536 mutants had moderate, variable responses and some of the strongest resistance to cycloheximide. At the H69-interaction region, P580 residues exhibited the same patterns of growth, with the strength of the phenotype increasing from P580A to D to F, the latter of which was also inviable in the presence of both aminoglycosides. Interestingly, residues near H43 showed little to no growth alterations in the presence of translation inhibitors, with the notable exceptions of Q753A, which conferred resistance to all four antibiotics, and S756A promoting strong resistance to cycloheximide. To determine if changes to these eEF2–ribosome interactions alters eEF2’s ability to promote accurate translocation, frameshifting directed by programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signals were measured. PRF signals are cis-acting elements that induce ribosomal pausing over a sequence that is prone to slippage. The most common PRF signals induce frameshifting of one nucleotide in either the 5′ or 3′ direction, referred to as −1 and +1 frameshifting, respectively. It has been shown that endogenous rates of PRF are controlled by kinetic partitioning between translocation intermediates (31Peng B.-Z. Bock L.V. Belardinelli R. Peske F. Grubmüller H. Rodnina M.V. Active role of elongation factor G in maintaining the mRNA reading frame during translation.Sci. Adv. 2019; 5eaax8030Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes to translocation caused by eEF2 mutation can be measured as deviations from the baseline proportion of frameshifting events. The effects of the mutants on programmed translational recoding were measured using dual luciferase assays of HIV-1–mediated −1 PRF and Ty1-driven +1 PRF as previously described (27Nabais Sá M.J. Olson A.N. Yoon G. Nimmo G.A.M. Gomez C.M. Willemsen M.A. et al.De novo variants in EEF2 cause a neurodevelopmental disorder with benign external hydrocephalus.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2021; 29: 3892-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, production of the downstream firefly luciferase enzymes is reliant on successful ribosomal frameshifting, while upstream Renilla luciferase functions as an internal control for any effects on general translation conferred by the mutants. Therefore, the ratio between the two luciferase activities, as measured by luminescence, is reflective of the fraction of times frameshifting occurs along this message. As shown in Figure 4A, the H69 mutants conferred the strongest effects on −1 PRF, with P580D and P580F demonstrating significant increases. Conversely, the R66Q and N748R mutants conferred moderate but significant decreases on −1 PRF. The L536E, L536K, and Q753A strains of the SRL and H43 regions promoted increases in +1 PRF, while the H69 mutations did not affect this translational recoding mechanism (Fig. 4B). We note, however, that the data tended to show a bimodal distribution, with clusters of high and low frameshift values. Therefore, only the Q753A strain had a statistically significant increase in frameshifting. As changes to frameshifting were seen using the translational fidelity reporters, translocation fidelity was further explored using an orthogonal method. Many commercial and research yeast strains are carriers of the L-A totivirus, a dsRNA virus that supports the M1 satellite virus, which encodes for the “killer toxin” which is lethal to noncarrier strains (32Wickner R.B. Yeast RNA virology: the killer systems.in: Broach J.R. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Genome Dynamics, Proteins Synthesis, and Energetics. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991: 263-296Google Scholar). The L-A virus genome contains a −1 PRF signal at the Gag/gag-pol juncture necessary for viral replication (33Dinman J.D. Icho T. Wickner R.B. A -1 ribosomal frameshift in a double-stranded RNA virus forms a Gag-pol fusion protein.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Maintenance of the Killer phenotype is highly dependent on −1 PRF efficiency (34Dinman J.D. Wickner R.B. Ribosomal frameshifting efficiency and Gag/Gag-pol ratio are critical for yeast M1 double-stranded RNA virus propagation.J.Virology. 1992; 66: 3669-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); therefore, defects in frameshifting will materialize as reduction or loss of viral persistence and killer toxin production. The parental strain used in these studies (yJD995) has the Killer+ (K+) phenotype, thus enabling us to determine the effects of the eEF2 mutants on viral maintenance. To monitor this, yeast strains are grown on a lawn of the diploid 5 × 47 K− indicator strain that is sensitive to the toxin, and the size of the zone of growth inhibition around the strain being tested is indicative of cellular M1 viral load. The R66A mutant was completely unable to maintain the Killer virus, and the R66F, L536A, P580D, and P580F showed partial decreases in killer activity, suggesting partial defects on virus maintenance (Fig. 4C). Quantitative analysis of the zones of growth inhibition are shown in Fig. S1. Given the relatively small effects of the mutants on −1 PRF in general, it is likely that the effects of these mutants on killer virus maintenance correlated better with decreased fitness as reflected by increased cell doubling times (compare with Fig. 2B). Based on the phenotypes displayed in the growth and translational fidelity assays, one mutation was selected from each cluster for deeper biophysical and biochemical characterization. R66A, P580H, and Q753A were chosen from the SRL, H69, and H43 regions, respectively. P580H, which was previously described in greater detail (17Hekman K.E. Yu G.Y. Brown C.D. Zhu H. Du X. Gervin K. et al.A conserved eEF2 coding variant in SCA26 leads to loss of translational fidelity and increased susceptibility to proteostatic insult.Hum.Mol.Genet. 2012; 21: 5472-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), is the original eEF2 mutation found to be causative for SCA26 and has previously demonstrated phenotypes similar to those expressed by P580D and P580F. Therefore, due to its known biological significance and characterization by several groups, P580H was chosen to represent the H69-interacting region. CD spectra were obtained for purified WT and three mutant eEF2s to determine whether the mutations imparted biophysical effects on eEF2 folding (Fig. 5A). The mutants all exhibited similar CD spectra to the WT protein, indicating that none conferred gross defects on eEF2 structure. This is consistent with their ability to support cell viability as the sole form of the protein.

https://openalex.org/W4310731299,"PKA-mediated phosphorylation of sarcomeric proteins enhances heart muscle performance in response to β-adrenergic stimulation and is associated with accelerated relaxation and increased cardiac output for a given preload. At the cellular level, the latter translates to a greater dependence of Ca2+ sensitivity and maximum force on sarcomere length (SL), that is, enhanced length-dependent activation. However, the mechanisms by which PKA phosphorylation of the most notable sarcomeric PKA targets, troponin I (cTnI) and myosin-binding protein C (cMyBP-C), lead to these effects remain elusive. Here, we specifically altered the phosphorylation level of cTnI in heart muscle cells and characterized the structural and functional effects at different levels of background phosphorylation of cMyBP-C and with two different SLs. We found Ser22/23 bisphosphorylation of cTnI was indispensable for the enhancement of length-dependent activation by PKA, as was cMyBP-C phosphorylation. This high level of coordination between cTnI and cMyBP-C may suggest coupling between their regulatory mechanisms. Further evidence for this was provided by our finding that cardiac troponin (cTn) can directly interact with cMyBP-C in vitro, in a phosphorylation- and Ca2+-dependent manner. In addition, bisphosphorylation at Ser22/Ser23 increased Ca2+ sensitivity at long SL in the presence of endogenously phosphorylated cMyBP-C. When cMyBP-C was dephosphorylated, bisphosphorylation of cTnI increased Ca2+ sensitivity and decreased cooperativity at both SLs, which may translate to deleterious effects in physiological settings. Our results could have clinical relevance for disease pathways, where PKA phosphorylation of cTnI may be functionally uncoupled from cMyBP-C phosphorylation due to mutations or haploinsufficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4310773965,"A life well lived inspires others to aspire. Our friend and mentor Susan L. Solomon crammed several lifetimes of exploration into her 71 years. Susan’s early life was filled with music: her mother was a pianist and her father the co-founder of Vanguard Records, known for supporting new and evolving music styles. As a teenager, she embarked on her first life journey, immersing herself in the 1960s San Francisco music/flower-power scene, where she knew luminaries such as Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. Driven by the principle of taking chances and plunging into previously uncharted domains, she then rose to prominence as a lawyer and business leader, where she was known for perpetually re-drawing perceived limits of innovation. As a young lawyer, she was particularly proud of the pro bono work she did in women’s rights, which directly led to the hiring of female firefighters in New York City. Susan’s life would change forever in 1992, when her son Ben was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 9. After learning that the treatment for diabetes had largely not changed since the 1920s and helplessly watching her third grader inject himself with insulin multiple times a day, she decided to take action. Upon immersing herself in the science of the time, she surmised that stem cell science held incredible potential—not just to tackle the disease that plagued her son and family, but also for many other diseases without a therapeutic option. As a fierce parent-patient advocate, she then embarked upon a decade-long journey that would draw upon the skills acquired in her various careers and circuitous life path and stitch them together with her love for family, leading her to co-found the New York Stem Cell Foundation (NYSCF), the mission of which was to harness the power of stem cell science to accelerate the development of new and innovative treatments for patients in need. To those who reasonably questioned whether a lawyer/business executive could succeed in bringing stem cell therapies to patients where others had failed, she simply said, “why not?” (although she often used more colorful language when confronted with a challenge that others deemed intractable). This was the fundamental essence of Susan, an unstoppable and unflappable force of nature that stem cell research will forever be grateful to have gained as an ally and champion. But it wasn’t easy. The origin of NYSCF took place during troubled times. Many of us vividly remember the Bush administration’s moratorium on the use of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research except for a handful of pre-established lines (1996 Dickey Wicker amendment, 2001 Bush moratorium). Rather than an obstacle, Susan saw this as an opportunity to rise above politics and do what was right for science and the millions of patients who, like Ben, faced a lifetime of illness. “This was a battle that very few people were willing to take on. It took courage, an indefatigable spirit, but Susan was one of the first and the best among them,” said one of her close friends at a memorial service honoring Susan that was recently held at Rockefeller University (hyperlink to memorial here—https://nyscf.org/events/susan-memorial/). Susan first taught herself everything there was to learn about stem cells and their therapeutic promise. She had an incredible skill for communicating a strong vision for change that resonated well beyond its roots in New York City. She found a way to inspire young scientists to work in this field and partnered with philanthropists to raise over $400M to power their work. Money was not all of it; we all became part of a visionary community of scientists that Susan brought together, year after year, to weave our stories and ideas, to influence and be influenced, emerging not only stronger but full of intention. The intention to be part of Susan’s mission, that of using stem cell research as the tool to better humankind and find cures to disease. Susan founded NYSCF in 2005 at her kitchen table in her apartment in Manhattan. Paraphrasing her own words, these were the years when her own family members would wake up to find all kinds of strangers sitting at their kitchen table before they even had their first cup of coffee! Susan may not have been a scientist, but she had a clear scientific vision for what the field needed. In 2008, barely a year after Yamanaka’s discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells, Susan and colleagues decided to create a bank of iPSCs that was meant to grow into a representation of the world’s populations. She recognized that inclusion of diverse patient samples was going to be important for the development of new medicines. She also recognized the need for high-throughput, automated generation and engineering of human stem cell lines, which today sits at the core of NYSCFs innovations and is an unprecedented resource that academia and industry routinely rely on to propel their science to greater impact. As NYSCF grew, Susan quickly realized that a program with such large ambition needed a fundamentally different infrastructure to succeed; one that would allow scientists to go beyond the limits of academia and simply “follow the science” without thinking about whether traditional granting institutes would fund it. The NYSCF Research Institute was born. Initially a one-room laboratory to derive stem cells from patients with diabetes, the Institute became the largest independent stem cell laboratory in the US and now includes programs in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and age-related macular degeneration, among others. Community was at the heart of Susan’s vision. Hers was a never-ending quest to bring together scientists with diverse expertise from cross-disciplinary fields into one boiling cauldron because she knew that this was how new ideas and surprising discoveries could be made. Susan wanted to change not only science but also its practitioners—scientists. Acutely aware of the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM fields, in 2014, Susan launched the NYSCF Initiative on Women in Science and Engineering (iWISE) with a goal of identifying actionable steps to improve diversity in STEM fields. Some of us were fortunate enough to be part of a small group of women that she convened around a busy table at the NYSCF headquarters. Susan asked about the obstacles that precluded women from being more recognized in our field, from holding more leadership positions, and from being a bigger part of the trajectory of science. Stories were told, many heard before. But Susan had a plan, one that called for action and a huge dose of self-accountability to be part of change. Susan took a no-nonsense approach and famously stated that rather than wait for a prince on a white horse to lead us to success, we should actually go find our own horse! This effort was part of a global set of initiatives started by Susan through NYSCF that led the way on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. NYSCF began offering programs for elementary, high school, and college students from underprivileged communities. Other initiatives, such as the Druckenmiller postdoctoral fellowships, were intended to inspire scientists to stay in the stem cell field. NYSCF’s Early Career Investigator Awards program, funded in collaboration with the Robertson Foundation, was conceived by Susan to make sure that the most promising early-stage investigators could pursue high-risk but potentially impactful stem cell science unencumbered by funding limitations. Susan was a true student of all aspects of the stem cell science ecosystem, and she routinely devised and implemented new strategies to address insufficiency. Under Susan’s leadership, that dream that started at her kitchen table, NYSCF, is now an organization with 114 full time scientists, engineers, and staff that occupy a 42,000 square-foot research institute in the heart of Manhattan. Without doubt, NYSCF has become a vibrant and enormously impactful global engine for stem cell science. In 2017, Susan was diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer; yet not even that could slow her down. Up until the very end, she ensured that the baton had safely passed to new leadership and that the NYSCF’s mission would not only be continued but that the foundation she had built and loved would thrive in the future. To recognize Susan’s outsized impact, the NYSCF Board of Directors recently decided to name the NYSCF Research Institute in Manhattan the “Susan L. Solomon Center for Precision Medicine”. True to form, when Susan learned of this decision a few days before her passing, she was very touched, but she also quickly wanted to know who was going to pay for it (as research buildings and institutes are frequently named in honor of significant donations). This was Susan, pragmatically thinking about the future of stem cell research even as she was soon to take leave of us mere mortals. It is often said that the power of a true leader, a teacher, a mentor, is best demonstrated by the legacy of mentees and the change that they will bring about in the future once they are set on the right path. So, to the next generations, go out there, find your inner Susan, and make the world a better place. We thank the many friends and colleagues who spoke at Susan’s memorial. Their words provided inspiration for the narrative we included here. We would also like to thank David McKeon and Lydia Boisi from the NYSCF for their invaluable editorial support during the writing of this obituary."

Two cleavages of NOTCH3 protein, at Asp80 and Asp121, were previously described in CADASIL pathological samples. Using monoclonal antibodies developed against a NOTCH3 neoepitope, we identified a third cleavage at Asp964 between an Asp-Pro sequence. We characterized the structural requirements for proteolysis at Asp964 and the vascular distribution of the cleavage event. A proteome-wide analysis was performed to find proteins that interact with the cleavage product. Finally, we investigated the biochemical determinants of this third cleavage event.

Hydrolysis of a second Asp-Pro site at the N-terminus of NOTCH3 in inherited vascular dementia.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 17246Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Both these cleavage events occur at Asp-Pro bonds situated between adjacent EGF-like domains (between repeats 1 and 2 for Asp80 and between 2 and 3 for Asp121). Four additional Asp-Pro sequences are found in human NOTCH3 ectodomain and have not yet been characterized. In the current work, we examined a third Asp-Pro site in NOTCH3 as a potential target of post-translational proteolysis in CADASIL. Using monoclonal antibodies that bind to the neoepitope generated by cleavage at Asp964, we describe the structural determinants and histological localization of this cleavage event. To understand potential consequences of the cleavage, we performed proteome-wide analysis of molecules capable of interacting with the product of Asp964 proteolysis. Finally, in vitro studies identified inhibitors and activators of cleavage, which suggest a mechanism that parallels that of cleavage at Asp80 and Asp121. There are six Asp-Pro sequences in the EGF-like repeat domain of human NOTCH3. Two sequences at positions 80 to 81 and 121 to 122 have been described before as disease-related sites of proteolysis in CADASIL (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P. Torres M.

Hydrolysis of a second Asp-Pro site at the N-terminus of NOTCH3 in inherited vascular dementia.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 17246Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Additional sites at positions 552 to 553, 854 to 855, 964 to 965, and 1086 to 1087 are located within the EGF-like repeats (Fig. 1A). Sites at positions 80 to 81, 121 to 122, 964 to 965, and 1086 to 1087 are situated between EGF-like repeats. Although all these Asp-Pro sequences may be candidate cleavage sites, this study focuses on sequences 964 to 965, which we hypothesized could be cleaved based on similarity to 80 to 81 and 121 to 122 (Fig. 1B). In prior work, we described generation of antibodies that recognize a neoepitope specific for the cleaved protein and that requires liberation of the C-terminal aspartic acid residue at the site of proteolysis (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P. Torres M. Keep S.G. et al.NOTCH3 is non-enzymatically fragmented in inherited cerebral small-vessel disease.J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of a second Asp-Pro site at the N-terminus of NOTCH3 in inherited vascular dementia.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 17246Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A similar approach was taken in this work in which we generated neoepitope antibodies to detect cleavage of NOTCH3 at Asp964. Rabbit monoclonal antibodies were generated against a peptide found in NOTCH3 ending at Asp964: SCLCRPGYTGAHCQHEAD. Several clones were obtained with high specificity for the peptide. Clone 69B was selected for further characterization and used for all experiments described later. When tested against peptides on dot blots, 69B demonstrated a strong preference for sequences that ended precisely with the immunogen (Fig. 2A). The antibody did not recognize peptides with deletions of the terminal aspartate residue or peptides that contained addition of non-native residues after Asp964. There was very weak binding to peptides, which contained amino acid extensions beyond the aspartate of the immunogen. To test the requirement for the C-terminal aspartic acid residue for antibody recognition on immunoblots, we generated recombinant constructs that appended the target sequence to the C terminus of GFP. Additional constructs featured deletions and extensions of amino acids to the sequence ending in Asp964 of NOTCH3. When proteins from cells transfected with these constructs were evaluated by immunoblotting using 69B, only the protein ending precisely with Asp964 was strongly recognized (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with selected GFP constructs in Figure 2B were fixed and stained using 69B. Though all transfectants stained equally for GFP, only cells receiving constructs that ended precisely with terminal Asp964 showed significant staining with 69B; deletion of the terminal Asp964 residue and addition of Pro965 to the recombinant GFP eliminated cell staining (Fig. 2C). We concluded that overall, 69B appears to strongly recognize protein ending in Asp964 of NOTCH3. Transfected 293 cells were analyzed to assess if NOTCH3 is cleaved in cells. Vector-transfected, wildtype full-length human NOTCH3, and R90C mutant–transfected cell lysates were incubated with 5 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Only NOTCH3-transfected cells expressed full-length NOTCH3 (red dot); this band did not react with 69B. Furthermore, using 69B, a faster migrating band appeared that was unique to NOTCH3-transfected cells. This finding was consistent with cleavage at Asp964 of the full-length wildtype and mutant protein in cell lysates. To characterize cleavage at Asp964 (which separates EGF-like repeats 24 and 25) in a purified system, we cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) sequences of NOTCH3 corresponding to EGF-like repeats 23 to 26 as fusions to the C terminus of mouse Fc. These recombinant clones were used to make stable 293 cell lines that secreted Fc-NOTCH3(23–26) protein into the conditioned media, from which pure recombinant NOTCH3 fragments were then prepared by Protein A-agarose affinity purification. Since Asp964 is located in the middle of the NOTCH3 sequences of Fc-NOTCH3(23–26), cleavage of the protein at Asp964 is predicted to liberate an Fc-containing fragment that is 8 kDa smaller than the intact protein. In the event of cleavage, the fragmented protein, but not the parent protein, is expected to react with 69B on immunoblots (Fig. 3B). Purified protein Fc-NOTCH3(23–26) from cell lines was separated by SDS-PAGE and demonstrated a major band reactive with anti-Fc antibodies at the expected size for uncleaved protein (Fig 3C; Fc band in red). This band was not reactive with 69B. But using 69B, we readily detected a smaller band at the size expected after Asp964 cleavage, which increased with time of incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3C). Cleavage of NOTCH3 at other Asp-Pro sequences (positions 80–81 and 121–122) were shown to be enhanced by acidic pH (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P. Torres M.

Similarly, cleavage of NOTCH3 at Asp-Pro positions 80 to 81 and 121 to 122 is enhanced by protein reduction (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P. Torres M.

Hydrolysis of a second Asp-Pro site at the N-terminus of NOTCH3 in inherited vascular dementia.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 17246Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To test whether the same holds true for cleavage at Asp964, we incubated Fc-NOTCH3(23–26) with increasing doses of TCEP, which resulted in increased cleavage product when assessed by immunoblotting with 69B (Fig. 3E; far right panel). The reduction-sensitive cutting process was not affected by pretreatment with chaotropic agent guanidinium or with heat treatment, which did not reduce the amount of cleavage facilitated by TCEP (Fig. 3F; first and second sets of proteins). To test if Pro965 of the Asp-Pro cleavage sequence is required for cleavage, we created a series of point mutants of Fc-NOTCH3(23–26) in which NOTCH3 residue 965 was mutated to all other amino acids (Fig. 3G). Mutant constructs were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and Fc proteins from conditioned media were concentrated using Protein A beads before analysis by immunoblotting. Comparable amounts of Fc protein were recovered from the wildtype construct and all point mutants. As shown in Figure 3, H–J, the amount of cleaved protein that was reactive to 69B was highest for the wildtype protein containing the wildtype proline residue at position 965. Only trace amounts of 69B-reactive protein were found in all the mutants. This indicates that the proline that follows the Asp964 cleavage site is critical for protein fragmentation. We used immunohistochemistry to analyze the location of Asp964 within arteries in CADASIL brain samples (Fig. 4). When 69B was used on genetically defined CADASIL frontal lobe sections, deposits were found in both leptomeningeal and penetrating vessels of the white matter, particularly in thickened arteries in which vessels showed vascular media degeneration and intimal hyperplasia (regions between arrows and arrowheads; best seen in leptomeningeal arteries). In comparison, non-CADASIL control brains did not show consistent staining with 69B in cerebral arteries. The reactivity pattern for Asp964 cutting was similar to what we have previously described using antibodies that detect Asp80 and Asp121 cleavage (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P.

Hydrolysis of a second Asp-Pro site at the N-terminus of NOTCH3 in inherited vascular dementia.Sci. Rep. 2021; 11: 17246Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Results represent analysis of 26 genetically defined CADASIL brains and 15 control brains without clinically apparent neurological disease. To better define the location of Asp964 cleavage in CADASIL samples, we stained serial sections with 69B (for Asp964 cleavage) and with antibodies UMI-F and 145H (for proteolysis at Asp80 and Asp121; Fig. 5). This revealed a markedly similar pattern in leptomeningeal arteries, where the borders between vascular layers are readily defined. Staining with all the antibodies appeared most intensely in the vascular media, defined by regions outside the internal elastic lamina that is seen in Miller staining of adjacent brain sections (Fig. 5; blue stain). The Asp964 cleavage was not as extensive as collagen deposition, which was found in both media and intima (Fig. 5; B-CHP for all collagens and M3F7 for type IV collagen). The 69B immunoreactivity also colocalized well with 2079 (NOTCH3 conformational antibody; (17Zhang X. Lee S.J. Young K.Z. Josephson D.A. Geschwind M.D. Wang M.M. Latent NOTCH3 epitopes unmasked in CADASIL and regulated by protein redox state.Brain Res. 2014; 1583: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)) in serial sections of the same artery (Fig. 5). Serial sections were also stained with 69B and mature smooth muscle markers ACTA2 and CNN1 (Fig. 5). In CADASIL, 69B reactivity in leptomeningeal arteries did not completely coincide with either smooth muscle marker; both ACTA2 and CNN1 was expressed strongly in the intima and in remnant balloon cells of the media. This agreed with prior work in which we showed redistribution of smooth muscle markers to the intima, whereas NOTCH3 remained localized to the media without preference to viable cells (20Gatti J.R.

Dean J.G. et al.Redistribution of mature smooth muscle markers in brain arteries in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.Transl.

In control arteries, 69B reactivity was not appreciated above background, whereas ACTA2 and CNN1 were expressed strongly in the media.

Having identified Asp964 cleavage in the vascular media of CADASIL, the principal site of pathology, we next explored whether the proteolytic product of this cleavage could interact with other proteins; moreover, we sought to test on a proteome-wide basis if some proteins preferentially interact with the cleavage product over the intact NOTCH3 protein. We applied purified protein fragments of Fc-NOTCH3(23–24), which includes two NOTCH3 EGF-like modules that terminate with Asp964 to protein microarrays that contain over 15,000 purified human proteins. A comparison group was generated by probing parallel protein microarrays with Fc-NOTCH3(23–26), in which four EGF-like modules include the uncleaved Asp-Pro sequence (Fig. 6A). Binding signals for all proteins on these microarrays revealed satisfactory reproducibility of binding levels. The experiment revealed that a subset of proteins were preferentially bound by Fc-NOTCH3(23–24) compared with Fc-NOTCH3(23–26). Another subset of proteins preferred binding to Fc-NOTCH3(23–26). An overview of the aggregate data is shown in Figure 6B, which shows a conventional volcano plot of the results, and in Figure 6C, we show a dot plot of all proteins tested by rank order of signal intensity. To explore whether individual proteins that bind to Asp964 could be classified according to biological pathway, we performed several analyses using established algorithms; a total of 261 proteins exhibited 1.5-fold increased binding to Fc-NOTCH3(23–24) compared with Fc-NOTCH3(23–26) (see Supporting information). The STRING algorithm (https://string-db.org) for exploration of protein interactions (Fig. 6D) shows potential interactions between proteins that bind to cleavage products; notable nodes in these networks include MAPK1 and PRKACG. Class analysis using the PANTHER algorithm (www.pantherdb.org) noted that the main protein class was transcriptional activators and metabolic enzymes (Fig. 6E). Binding proteins and cellular process (Fig. 6, F and G) were the most common categorizations of NOTCH3 truncation product–binding proteins. Of note, 18 groups of related proteins were identified as having preference for binding to protein terminating in Asp964 (Fig. 6H), which suggests that this NOTCH3 fragment may target a homologous protein domain common to each member of the class. On the other hand, most of these classes do not have significant homology, indicating that the targets of the Asp964-terminated NOTCH3 fragment are heterogeneous. Prior work has established experimental factors that regulated NOTCH3 Asp-Pro cleavage (18Young K.Z. Lee S.J. Zhang X. Cartee N.M.P. Torres M.

https://openalex.org/W4310785104,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is frequently dysregulated in various cancers. The ubiquitin ligase Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (Cbl) regulates degradation of activated EGFR through ubiquitination and acts as an adaptor to recruit proteins required for trafficking. Here, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture mass spectrometry to compare Cbl complexes with or without epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. We identified over a hundred novel Cbl interactors, and a secondary siRNA screen found that knockdown of Flotillin-2 (FLOT2) led to increased phosphorylation and degradation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation in HeLa cells. In PC9 and H441 cells, FLOT2 knockdown increased EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and downstream signaling, reversible by EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. CRISPR knockout (KO) of FLOT2 in HeLa cells confirmed EGFR downregulation, increased signaling, and increased dimerization and endosomal trafficking. Furthermore, we determined that FLOT2 interacted with both Cbl and EGFR. EGFR downregulation upon FLOT2 loss was Cbl dependent, as coknockdown of Cbl and Cbl-b restored EGFR levels. In addition, FLOT2 overexpression decreased EGFR signaling and growth. Overexpression of wildtype (WT) FLOT2, but not the soluble G2A FLOT2 mutant, inhibited EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation in HEK293T cells. FLOT2 loss induced EGFR-dependent proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Lastly, FLOT2 KO increased tumor formation and tumor volume in nude mice and NSG mice, respectively. Together, these data demonstrated that FLOT2 negatively regulated EGFR activation and dimerization, as well as its subsequent ubiquitination, endosomal trafficking, and degradation, leading to reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W4311019831,"Interferon-gamma (IFNG) has long been regarded as the flag-bearer for the anti-cancer immunosurveillance mechanisms. However, relatively recent studies have suggested a dual role of IFNG, albeit there is no direct experimental evidence for its potential pro-tumor functions. Here we provide in vivo evidence that treatment of mouse melanoma cell lines with Ifng enhances their tumorigenicity and metastasis in lung colonization allograft assays performed in immunocompetent syngeneic host mice, but not in immunocompromised host mice. We also show that this enhancement is dependent on downstream signaling via Stat1 but not Stat3, suggesting an oncogenic function of Stat1 in melanoma. The experimental results suggest that melanoma cell-specific Ifng signaling modulates the tumor microenvironment and its pro-tumorigenic effects are partially dependent on the γδ T cells, as Ifng-enhanced tumorigenesis was inhibited in the TCR-δ knockout mice. Overall, these results show that Ifng signaling may have tumor-promoting effects in melanoma by modulating the immune cell composition of the tumor microenvironment."

The second harmonic of the TDLAS signal can be easily obtained without a reference signal. The TDLAS signal is firstly processed by band-pass filtering, then the envelope of the processed signal is obtained with Hilbert transform. And finally, the second harmonic is extracted from the 1f component of the envelope. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by simulation and verified by experiment, and the result shows that the error is acceptable under the cases of weak absorbance, which indicates that the proposed method is applicable to practical trace gas detection."

This study will explore the difference in time perception between MDD and BD using a temporal bisection task.In this temporal bisection task, 30 MDD patients, 30 BD patients, and 30 healthy controls (HC) had to categorize a signal duration, between 400 and 1600 milliseconds (ms), as either short or long. A repeated measurement analysis of variance with 3 (subject type) × 7 (time interval) was performed on the long response ratio with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Origin software was used to calculate the subjective bisection point (BP), difference limen (DL), and Weber ratio (WR). The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale for depression-17 was used to assess depressive symptoms in the patients.The data showed that the interaction effect between subject type and duration was significant (F (6,498) = 4.656, p <0.001, η2p = 0.101). At 400 ms, and the long response of the MDD group was greater than HC group (p<0.017, Bonferroni-corrected). At 1200, 1400 and 1600 ms, the long response of BD group is smaller than HC group, (p<0.017, Bonferroni-corrected). The one-way ANOVA revealed significant difference among the HC, MDD and BD groups in the BP values WR values, F(2, 81) = 3.462, p = 0.036 vs. F(2, 81) = 3.311, p = 0.042. Post-hoc tests showed that the value of BP in the MDD group was less than BD group (p = 0.027) and the value of BP in the MDD group was less than HC group (p = 0.027), while there was not significant difference of BP values between BD group and HC group. The WR values in MDD group larger than the HC group (p = 0.022).Severity of depression not divided and analyzed according to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score.The time perception of the MDD and BD groups was different from that of the HC group, they overestimated short time periods. Compared with the BD group, the MDD group had a smaller time bisector, and these patients felt that time passed more slowly.

https://openalex.org/W4311290602,"The objective of this study was to assess the quantitative diagnostic value of T2 relaxation time for determining liver iron grades in the presence of fat and fibrosis. Sixty Sprague-Dawley (SD) male rats were randomly divided into control (10 rats) and model (50 rats) groups. The model group of coexisting iron, steatosis, and liver fibrosis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) dissolved in edible vegetable oil (40% v/v). The control group received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.9% saline. All rats underwent multi-echo gradient and spin echo (M-GRASE) magnetic resonance imaging, and the T2 relaxation time of the liver was measured. The rats were killed immediately after imaging, and liver specimens were extracted for histological evaluation of steatosis, iron, and fibrosis. The relationship and differences between T2 relaxation time and liver fibrosis stage, as well as the pathological grade of hepatic steatosis, were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and interaction analysis were used to quantify the diagnostic performance of T2 relaxation time for detecting different degrees of liver iron grades. Six normal control rats and 34 model rats were included in this study. Fibrosis stages were F0 (n = 6), F1 (n = 6), F2 (n = 8), F3 (n = 10), and F4 (n = 10). Steatosis grades were S0 (n = 5), S1 (n = 8), S2 (n = 12), and S3 (n = 15). Hepatocyte or Kupffer cell iron grades were 0 (n = 7), 1 (n = 9), 2 (n = 12), 3 (n = 10), and 4 (n = 2). The liver fibrosis stages were positively correlated with the iron grades (P < 0.01), and the iron grades and fibrosis stages were negatively correlated with the T2 relaxation time (P < 0.01). The T2 relaxation times exhibited strongly significant differences among rats with different histologically determined iron grades (P < 0.01). Pairwise comparisons between each grade of liver iron indicated significant differences between all iron grades, except between grades 0 and 1, and between grades 1 and 2 (P > 0.05). The T2 relaxation time of the liver had an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.965 (95% CI 0.908-0.100, P < 0.001) for distinguishing rats with a pathological grade of hepatic iron (grade ≥ 1) from those without, an AUC of 0.871 (95% CI 0.757-0.985, P < 0.001) for distinguishing rats with no iron overload (grade ≤ 1) from rats with moderate or severe iron overload (grade ≥ 2), and an AUC of 0.939 (95% CI 0.865-1.000, P < 0.001) for distinguishing rats with no to moderate iron overload (grade ≤ 2) from rats with severe iron overload (grade 3). The interaction of different pathological grades of iron, steatosis, and fibrosis has a negligible influence on the T2 relaxation time (P > 0.05). In conclusion, T2 relaxation time can assess histologically determined liver iron grades, regardless of coexisting liver steatosis or fibrosis; therefore, it is suitable for distinguishing between the presence and absence of iron deposition and it is more accurate for higher iron grading."
