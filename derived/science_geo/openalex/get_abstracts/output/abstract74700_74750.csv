https://openalex.org/W1601599671,"Abstract 1. The acidic fraction of a lipid extract of human seminal plasma was analyzed for compounds giving ultraviolet absorption at 278 mµ before or after treatment with NaOH. 2. By means of silicic acid chromatography, reversed phase partition chromatography, and thin layer chromatography eight prostaglandins, not previously recognized, having the above properties, were isolated in pure form. 3. Four of the isolated compounds were identified by comparison with known substances as: 15-hydroxy-9-ketoprosta10,13-dienoic acid, 15-hydroxy-9-ketoprosta-5,10, 13-trienoic acid, 15-hydroxy-9-ketoprosta-8(12),13-dienoic acid, and 15-hydroxy-9-ketoprosta-5,8(12),13-trienoic acid. 4. The other four compounds were assigned the following structures by physical methods and chemical degradations: 15,19-dihydroxy-9-ketoprosta-10,13-dienoic acid, 15,19-dihydroxy-9-ketoprosta-5,10,13-trienoic acid, 15,19-dihydroxy-9-ketoprosta-8(12),13-dienoic acid, and 15, 19-dihydroxy-9-ketoprosta-5,8-(12),12-trienoic acid. 5. The 19 hydroxy derivatives were present in about four times higher concentrations than the prostaglandin E compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1561017210,"Abstract Nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDP kinase) was identified in high concentrations in human erythrocytes, and a procedure was developed for the isolation of this enzyme. The best preparations had about 1400-fold greater specific activity (65 units per mg of protein) than that of hemolysates. Like crystalline yeast NDP kinase and partially purified NDP kinase preparations from various tissues, the erythrocytic enzyme is relatively nonspecific with regard to nucleotide substrates. Although there are differences in the kinetic constants, the di- and triphosphate nucleotides which contain natural purine and pyrimidine bases, and ribose or deoxyribose, and in addition a number of nucleotides which contain purine or pyrimidine analogues all serve as substrates. A kinetic analysis was performed which included initial velocity and alternative substrate studies, and study of inhibition by 5'-monophosphate nucleotides. The results of these studies were consistent with the concept that the erythrocytic NDP kinase follows a ping-pong mechanism. This permitted the postulation that the reactive intermediate is the phosphorylated enzyme."

Since the aforesaid classes of compounds are all transported by similar, sodium-ion-dependent mechanisms and elicit countertransport of each other, all may share a common, polyfunctional carrier in which a series of separate binding sites, namely, one each for sugars, neutral amino acids, basic amino acids, and Na(+) are joined together, as in a mosaic."

Inhibitory effects on respiration and on RNA synthesis could not be dissociated from one another over a wide range of drug concentrations. Actinomycin D also impaired protein synthesis, probably by decreasing the availability of adenosine triphosphate and by inhibiting messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1525321766,"Abstract 1. A method is described for the isolation and purification of myoglobin from sperm whale skeletal muscle. The aqueous extract is brought to 25% ethanol by volume at -10 to - 12° and pH 6.5. A fraction precipitated with lead subacetate is discarded. Myoglobin is precipitated from the supernatant solution at pH 7.20 by adding zinc acetate to a concentration of approximately 10 mm. The precipitate is dissolved in the cold by addition of EDTA, dialyzed against EDTA and water, and rendered salt-free by ion exchange resins. Under favorable conditions the myoglobin is almost entirely in the oxygenated form. 2. Removal of impurities and conversion to ferrimyoglobin and deoxygenated ferromyoglobin are described according to several procedures. Purity is assayed by chromatography, electrophoresis, spectrophotometric analysis, and immunochemical analysis. 3. Crystallization of oxymyoglobin is described. Conversion to the ferri form in the crystalline state does not appear to cause disruption of the crystals. 4. Stability of oxymyoglobin prepared by the zinc-ethanol procedure is comparable to that of chromatographically separated preparations. It is much better than that of oxymyoglobin prepared by reduction of ferrimyoglobin by dithionite. The present procedure avoids the rapid autoxidation that occurs during the preparative procedure of Kendrew and Parrish. 5. Absorption and optical rotatory spectra of the highly purified preparations are presented. 6. The microheterogeneity of sperm whale myoglobin described by Edmundson and Hirs is confirmed. Evidence is presented that the different components differ from each other in composition by steps of about the same degree, quite possibly in amide content as suggested by Edmundson and Hirs."
https://openalex.org/W1579993913,"The amino acid composition and sialic acid content were determined on preparations of human serum β1-lipoprotein shown to be homogeneous by analytical ultracentrifugation, electrophoresis, and gel filtration. The amino acid composition of β1-lipoprotein was compared with a number of other proteins. In contrast to structural lipoproteins, which have been reported to have an usually high content of nonpolar amino acid residues, the amino acid composition of β1-lipoprotein more closely resembles that of soluble simple proteins. A larger contribution to the lipid-binding properties of the polypeptide may be made by electrostatic interactions than by hydrophobic bonding."

https://openalex.org/W1552519231,"Inactive forms of the tryptophan pyrrolase occur in soluble rat liver preparations. Their slow activation is responsible for the previously observed acceleration of this reaction. Maximal activation of the enzyme occurs during a 30-min preincubation with its substrate, l -tryptophan, and ascorbic acid, in the case of livers from tryptophan-treated rats, and with these additions plus methemoglobin as a source of the hematin prosthetic group, in the case of livers from untreated and hydrocortisone-treated rats. Although similar additions are necessary for the catalytic activity, the activation can occur when catalysis is prevented by anaerobiosis. Activation and catalysis are separate reactions. The total activities in rat livers assayed after this maximal activation are higher and more reproducible than from previous measurements. Greater increases in the enzyme activity are found with this assay procedure than by previous assays, after treatment of the rats with tryptophan and especially with hydrocortisone."

This enzyme was used to explore the linkage of mannose in several glycoproteins. The α-mannosidase was shown to liberate mannose from ovomucoid, orosomucoid, ovalbumin, and glycopeptide prepared from ovalbumin, suggesting the presence of α-mannosidic linkage in these glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1556972453,"1. A new and convenient synthesis of p-nitrophenyl diazoacetate has been devised from p-nitrophenyl chloroformate and diazomethane. 2. p-Nitrophenyl diazoacetate reacts stoichiometrically with chymotrypsin to yield diazoacetyl chymotrypsin. 3. Photolysis of the diazoacetyl enzyme with light of wave length greater than 320 mµ yields a mixture of (a) glycolic acid and regenerated chymotrypsin and (b) modified protein which retains the carbon atoms of the diazoacetyl group. 4. Acid hydrolysis of the protein obtained from photolysis yields O-carboxymethylserine, identified by chromatographic and other comparisons with an authentic sample and with material formed on photolysis of azaserine. 5. In addition, small amounts of 1-carboxymethylhistidine and of O-carboxymethyltyrosine were obtained. The origin of the former is uncertain, but the latter may arise from photolysis of a dimer of the diazoacetylated enzyme. 6. Most of the products presumably arise from a carbene formed as a primary product of the photolysis of the diazoester."
https://openalex.org/W1523942977,"Abstract Large scale preparation of purified photoreactivating enzyme from commercial bakers' yeast has been described. The enzyme has been purified approximately 3000-fold over the crude extract with an over-all yield of 5 to 6%. The purified enzyme has a pH optimum at 7.2 and does not require any metal ions for activity. High phosphate concentration inhibits enzyme activity with an optimum activity at 0.02 m phosphate. The purified enzyme shows no absorption peaks between 300 and 400 mµ and has a small amount of typical cytochrome absorption. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the purified enzyme indicates the presence of one large homogeneous component and another small component which does not show a peak in the schlieren pattern, but absorbs light at 546 mµ. The average molecular weight of the large component is ∼30,000."
https://openalex.org/W1542561015,"Abstract The enzymes responsible for the first two steps in the degradation of myo-inositol by Aerobacter aerogenes were identified and isolated from extracts of a constitutive mutant, that is, a strain containing high levels of these enzymes even when grown in an inositol-free medium. The enzyme catalyzing the initial step, the dehydrogenation of myo-inositol, is strongly inhibited by its product. It could be shown that the dehydrogenation involves the transfer of a hydrogen from carbon atom 2 of the inositol ring to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; the product is therefore 2-keto-myo-inositol. The second step is the dehydration of 2-keto-myo-inositol. The enzyme responsible for this reaction is unstable when exposed to oxygen, and requires glutathione and Co++ or Mn++ for maximal activity; its product was identified as d-2,3-diketo-4-deoxy-epi-inositol. This compound can be reduced by myo-inositol dehydrogenase in the presence of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to a ketodeoxyinositol. However, this reaction does not appear to be involved in the degradation of myo-inositol."

Succinylation results in a further dissociation into two nonfunctional subunits of approximately 34,000 to 35,000 molecular weight. Amino acid analysis and tryptic peptide patterns indicate that the functional subunit is composed of at least two polypeptide chains which are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1524324165,"Abstract A procedure for the partial fractionation and purification of dAMP, dGMP, dCMP, and dTMP kinases from calf thymus is described. The results obtained indicate that there are at least four distinct nucleoside monophosphokinases, specific for adenine, guanine, cytosine and uracil, and thymine. The kinase specific toward dCMP was further purified and it was shown that the stability of this enzyme was absolutely dependent on the presence of thiol. The purified dCMP kinase preparation also catalyzed the phosphorylation of CMP and UMP. These three pyrimidine nucleotides were found to be competitive inhibitors for each other. However, under appropriate conditions in the absence of thiol, dCMP kinase activity was lost without appreciable change in the other two kinase activities. The dCMP kinase activity that had been lost was easily restored by incubating with thiol compounds. Several other properties of the purified enzyme are also described."
https://openalex.org/W1558471380,"Abstract A species of Pseudomonas which grows on methylamine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen was isolated from soil enrichment cultures. The lack of pigmentation in the organism and its unusual substrate specificity suggest that it is a species of Pseudomonas distinct from those previously isolated from one carbon substrate enrichments. When grown on methylamine, the new Pseudomonas sp. elaborates an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction between methylamine and l-glutamate to form a hitherto unknown biological intermediate, N-methylglutamate, and ammonia. The enzyme is absent from cells grown on glycerol and ammonia in the absence of methylamine. A number of possible reaction mechanisms to explain N-methylglutamate synthesis have been studied with the conclusion that the reaction is reversible and most likely proceeds by a direct displacement mechanism. Evidence from studies with 15N-labeled substrates are not compatible with a transmethylation mechanism. The possible role of N-methylglutamate synthetase in the one carbon metabolism of this organism is suggested by the results of pulse-labeling experiments showing the appearance of isotope from 14C-methylamine in N-methylglutamate, sarcosine, serine, alanine, and aspartate in the order indicated."
https://openalex.org/W1585123031,"Abstract Propionyl coenzyme A was carboxylated with epimerase-free carboxylase, and the resulting methylmalonyl coenzyme A (a) was reduced with Raney nickel. Isolation of (-)-(R)-β-hydroxyisobutyric acid N-phenylcarbamate (11) from the reaction mixture showed that methylmalonyl coenzyme A (a) has the (S) configuration. Propionyl coenzyme A was also converted to deuteriosuccinate with a D2O extract of a beef liver mitochondrial acetone powder. The deuteriosuccinate had a plain positive optical rotatory dispersion curve corresponding to the (S) configuration. It was concluded that (S)-methylmalonyl coenzyme A, formed by carboxylation of propionyl coenzyme A, was epimerized in D2O to (RS)-methylmalonyl(coenzyme A)-2-D, and that (R)-methylmalonyl(coenzyme A)-2-D was isomerized to succinyl coenzyme A with net retention of configuration of C-2. Since, in contrast, the glutamate mutase reaction proceeds with inversion, the lack of stereochemical uniformity in these two otherwise closely related rearrangements suggests that they may involve at least two steps, one or more of which are analogous, but at least one taking place with different stereochemistry. It is suggested that the cobamide coenzyme releases an electrophilic 5'-deoxyadenosyl group (perhaps reversibly to a methionyl residue on the enzyme), and that the resulting Co:i complex participates in the rearrangement by removal and transfer of a proton or other cationic fragment."
https://openalex.org/W1498153303,"Abstract 1. Exhaustive digestion of native human serum β1-lipoprotein by either trypsin or pronase resulted in the hydrolysis of only a fraction of the potentially susceptible peptide bonds. However, hydrolysis of the lipid-free protein by these enzymes was more nearly complete. 2. Peptide maps of the products of tryptic digestion indicated that a specific segment of the polypeptide chain of the native molecule was attacked. This was supported by the observation that the amino acid composition of the soluble products resulting from either tryptic or pronase digestion differed significantly both from the parent molecule and from the residual large polypeptide component. 3. The histidine residues present in the segments attacked by trypsin or pronase were also those which were most readily modified by chemical reagents."

https://openalex.org/W1588847275,"Abstract With kidney cells cultured directly from the animal, increases in the labeling of the deoxycytidylate pool from 3H-cytidine and in deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity begin at about the time of initiation of DNA formation. Some of the possible causal interrelationships of these three changes have been examined. With the use of phleomycin to block DNA synthesis, it has been shown that neither the increase in dCMP nor the increase in polymerase activity is triggered by the act of DNA replication. Hydroxyurea reversibly blocks the rise in the labeling of the dCMP pool. With this inhibitor, it has been shown that the normal increase in the deoxyribonucleotide pool is not essential for the increase in DNA polymerase activity. Nor does the rise in the deoxyribonucleotide pool appear to be required for entry of a kidney cell into the period of DNA synthesis. When cells inhibited with hydroxyurea were irradiated with x-rays (which prevent entry into the replicative stage but have little effect upon the continuation of DNA formation), removal of the chemical inhibitor was followed by the synthesis of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1565023713,"Abstract Electrophoretic separations and amino acid analyses of the multiple hemoglobins of Rana grylio tadpoles and frogs are reported which show that major changes in the primary structures of these hemoglobins are taking place during metamorphosis. Amino acid compositions of adult Rana pipiens and Rana catesbeiana hemoglobins are also presented. Studies in the ultracentrifuge showed that the hemoglobins of two bullfrog species dimerize in vitro to the extent of 70 to 80%. The ability to form dimers is a function of the stage of metamorphosis. Mercaptoethanol was the only reagent tested that reconverted all of the dimer molecules to monomers. The molecular weight of the dimer was found to be 130,000. The mechanism of dimer formation involves the disappearance of reactive sulfhydryl groups in frog hemoglobins after hemolysis. The rate at which these —SH groups were lost was related to the rate at which the dimer was formed in the ultracentrifuge. The rate of —SH disappearance in the dimerizing systems was significantly faster than in the nondimerizing hemoglobins, and corresponded to a loss of two —SH groups per 65,000 g of hemoglobin. Two assay methods were used for measuring sulfhydryl content, p-chloromercuribenzoate titrations, and mercury orange determinations. A model for dimer formation was also proposed. The oxygen binding properties of hemoglobin monomer and dimer were determined with the use of fractions isolated by starch block electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1596492511,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of the cytochrome c from the flight muscles of a saturnid moth, Samia cynthia, has been established. This protein is functionally and structurally homologous to other mammalian-type cytochromes c. However, it differs from cytochromes c of vertebrate origin by having a nonacetylated NH2-terminal residue, being 107 rather than 104 residues long and carrying an arginine rather than a lysine at Position 13, immediately before the first thioether-bonded cysteine. These characteristics appear to be common to nonvertebrate cytochromes c, including the bakers' yeast protein. In other primary structure features, S. cynthia cytochrome c resembles the vertebrate more than the yeast proteins, as might be expected from the phylogenetic relations of fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates. S. cynthia cytochrome c carries a phenylalanine at Position 65, in place of the methionyl residue found in the other homologous proteins, indicating the lack of a specific requirement for methionine at this position."
https://openalex.org/W1512320422,"Abstract 4-Deuterioglutamic acid was prepared by incubation in D2O of ammonium mesaconate with an extract of Clostridium tetanomorphum. In these extracts, methylaspartase catalyzed the formation of threo-3-methyl-l-aspartate-3-D, which was then rearranged to glutamate by the cobamide coenzyme-dependent glutamate mutase. The monodeuteriosuccinate obtained by chloramine-T oxidation of the glutamate showed a plain negative optical rotatory dispersion curve, and was therefore (R)-succinate-2-D. It was concluded that the intramolecular rearrangement of thero-3-methyl-l-aspartate to l-glutamate proceeded by net inversion of configuration of carbon atom 3. (R)-Succinate-2-D was also prepared from (2S,3R)-aspartic acid-3-D."
https://openalex.org/W1524244735,"Methods are described for the study of the biosynthesis of the azapteridine antibiotic, toxoflavin, in cultures of Pseudomonas cocovenenans. The formation of this compound has been obtained not only under conditions of growth of the organism in a chemically complex medium, but also with washed cell suspensions under chemically defined culture conditions. Isotopic tracer experiments have shown that (a) the pyrimido moiety of the antibiotic originates in the corresponding portion of the ring structure of a purine derivative at an oxidation level no higher than xanthine; (b) the two N-methyl substituents may be derived from methionine methyl groups; and (c) carbon atom 8 of the imidazole moiety of the purine precursor is expelled during biosynthesis, with the subsequent insertion of the aminomethyl group of glycine to complete the as-triazine ring portion of toxoflavin. Stimulation of toxoflavin synthesis under chemically defined conditions has been achieved by the inclusion of purine derivatives, methionine, and biochemical sources of glycine in the medium. The results are discussed in terms of their relationship to the general problem of the biological transformation of purines to pteridines."
https://openalex.org/W1506019657,"Abstract Alkaline phosphatase from bovine synovial fluid was purified 2300-fold. A molecular weight of 72,300 was determined from sucrose density gradient studies. The following monoesters were hydrolyzed by the enzyme: β-glycerophosphate, galactosamine 6-phosphate, glucosamine 6-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, o-phospho-l-serine, o-carboxyphenyl phosphate, phenyl phosphate, and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Kinetic studies of the enzyme were made with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate. Adenosine triphosphate and pyrophosphate were not hydrolyzed by the enzyme. Activation of the enzyme was observed with Sr2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ ions. Cyanide and fluoride, as well as ethylenediaminetetraacetate, inhibited the enzyme activated by Mg2+ while the chelating agent, 1,2-bis(-2-dicarboxymethylaminoethoxy)ethane (EGTA), inhibited the enzyme activated by Ca2+. Diisopropylfluorophosphate and p-chloromercuribenzoate were virtually without effect on the activity. The pH optimum increased with increasing substrate concentration. The pH profiles were obtained for pKm, log Vmax, and log Vmax/Km. These data show the existence of two groups at the active site having pK values of 8.6 and 9.6."

https://openalex.org/W1547705148,"Abstract A method is described for the purification of Component E of glutamate mutase about 180-fold with an 18% yield. The purified component shows no β-methylaspartase activity and is virtually free of the gel supernatant (S) component of the mutase. The most highly purified preparations contain about 75% of one protein and 25% of a second protein as judged by ionophoresis and ultracentrifugation. The activity is associated with the major component. Sedimentation analysis of the major component gave an s20,w value of 6.90 and a calculated molecular weight of approximately 128,000. Component E preparations are light pink, apparently because of contamination by corrinoid vitamins. They do not contain significant amounts of pyridoxine or related B6 vitamins. Component E is rather stable to storage under several conditions but is rapidly inactivated by freezing in the presence of mercaptoethanol or by incubation at 0° with some cationic buffers, such as tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and imidazole. Inactivation by Tris is largely prevented by 50 mm l-glutamate, methylaspartate, or, less effectively, by l-aspartate; neutral amino acids appear to be ineffective. The results indicate that glutamate and methylaspartate have a special affinity for the E component. Both purified Component E and partially purified Component S are essential for glutamate mutase activity under either aerobic or anaerobic assay conditions. For maximal activity, at least one of the components must be reduced by incubation with mercaptoethanol or another sulfhydryl compound before it is used in the assay; reduction of either component is about equally effective. The addition of 1 to 3 mm mercaptoethanol to the spectrophotometric assay solution is also beneficial. The influence of the relative amounts of the E and S components on mutase activity has been determined. There is an optimal amount of Component S which increases with the amount of Component E in the assay system. Superoptimal amounts of Component S inhibit markedly. The interaction of Component S with Component E to cause activation or inhibition is increased by higher levels of mercaptoethanol. The binding of B12 coenzyme to Component E was investigated by two methods; both indicate that the binding is relatively weak. The possibility that free ammonium ion or α-ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the glutamate mutase reaction was eliminated by tracer experiments showing that neither 15NH4+ nor α-ketoglutarate-14C is incorporated into the products."
https://openalex.org/W154868316,"The product of the first two reactions in the enzymatic degradation of myo-inositol by extracts of Aerobacter aerogenes, d -2,3-diketo-4-deoxy-epi-inositol, serves as the substrate for another enzyme also present in these extracts. The enzyme was partly purified and could be shown to catalyze, presumably after a preliminary isomerization, the hydrolytic cleavage of the inositol ring. The product of the reaction was isolated and identified by the study of its chemical and physical properties as a 4-deoxy-5-ketohexonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1601904150,"Abstract Rapidly labeled nuclear ribonucleic acid was extracted with phenol from normal and regenerating livers after 14C-orotic acid injection. Highest specific activities were obtained 20 min after the injection of the precursor. When bentonite was used in the phenol extraction, the distribution of the radioactivity in the sedimentation profiles of the rapidly labeled nuclear RNA was modified. In presence of bentonite, the peak of radioactivity precedes the ultraviolet absorption peak of the RNA of highest molecular weight. After partial hepatectomy, the specific activity of the phenol-extracted, rapidly labeled nuclear RNA increases between 0 and 6 hours and 12 and 24 hours, but remains unchanged between 6 and 12 hours after operation. The increase in specific activity is caused by an increase in the labeling of the RNA of highest molecular weight. Whole body doses of x-radiation administered 6 hours prior to killing the experimental animals interfere with the incorporation of 14C-orotic acid in the rapidly labeled nuclear RNA extracted from liver obtained 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after partial hepatectomy. The effect of x-radiation is more marked 18 and 24 hours than 6 and 12 hours after partial hepatectomy. Irradiation is without effect on the incorporation of 14C-orotic acid into the rapidly labeled nuclear RNA extracted from normal livers. In normal or regenerating liver, x-irradiation does not modify the ultraviolet absorption profiles of the phenol-extracted, rapidly labeled nuclear RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1542100309,"The enzyme system ((+)-citramalate hydro-lyase, also called mesaconase) from Clostridium tetanomorphum, that catalyzes the reversible hydration of mesaconate to (+)-citramalate has been studied. A rapid, spectrophotometric assay for this activity has been developed, based upon the absorbance increase at 250 mµ when citramalate is converted to mesaconate. Cysteine, or certain other sulfhydryl compounds, and ferrous ion are essential components of the assay system. The enzyme system is inactivated by exposure to oxygen, and is fully activated by anaerobic incubation with a sulfhydryl compound for 1 to 2 hours at 37°. Ferrous ion is required for activation in the presence of cysteine, and EDTA inhibits the activation process. Column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose separates the mesaconase system into two components, both of which are required for activity. The activities of the individual components may be determined in the spectrophotometric assay, following incubation of one component in the presence of an excess of the other under the activation conditions mentioned above. Component I has been purified about 75-fold and Component II about 100-fold relative to the crude extract. Limited observations on the properties of the components indicate that they are both proteins. Their behavior on columns of Sephadex G-100 indicates that Component II has a molecular weight above 100,000 whereas Component I is much smaller."
https://openalex.org/W1569038233,"Abstract The chemical reactivities of the side chains of several amino acids present in the polypeptide moiety of native human serum β1-lipoprotein have been compared with their reactivities after denaturation or lipid extraction. It was found that, although all lysine residues of the native protein coupled rapidly with O-methylisourea, only a fraction of the histidine imidazoles and cystine disulfides were modified when the intact molecule was treated with appropriate reagents; the reactivities of these residues were enhanced in the denatured or lipid-free protein. It was also found that, contrary to previous work with other proteins, modification of histidine imidazoles resulted from treatment of the lipoprotein with O-methylisourea. Possible interpretations of these observations in terms of the structure of the lipoprotein are presented."
https://openalex.org/W1497405276,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of chicken heart cytochrome c has been established. This primary structure is typically that of a mammalian-type cytochrome c showing the characteristic groupings of hydrophobic and basic residues, and, like the other cytochromes c from vertebrate species, has an acetylated amino-terminal residue.

https://openalex.org/W1493870546,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of rabbit heart cytochrome c has been determined from the complete amino acid sequences of the chymotryptic peptides and the compositions of the tryptic peptides. This primary structure, as well as the properties of the protein, shows that rabbit heart cytochrome c is typically of the mammalian type. The rabbit protein consists of a polypeptide chain 104 residues in length with a clustered distribution of the hydrophobic and basic amino acids similar to that of other cytochromes c of the same group. The numbers of residue differences between the cytochrome c of rabbit and those of a number of mammals are in the range of 4 to 9, while the differences between the rabbit protein and those of chicken, tuna, moth, and bakers' yeast are 8, 18, 27, and 44, respectively. The latter set of variations is compatible with an approximate proportionality between the extent of cytochrome c residue substitutions and the times elapsed since the divergence of the evolutionary lines leading to species in different large taxonomic groupings. The most remarkable variation in the rabbit protein is the replacement of a valine for the proline commonly observed in other cytochromes c in position 44."
https://openalex.org/W1555034574,"Abstract 1. A differential incorporation of 14C-glucose into two distinct molecular weight fractions of glycogen from the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta has been observed. Changes in these labeling patterns as a function of the glycogen level have been examined. 2. After incubation of Hymenolepis diminuta in media containing 14C-glucose under steady state conditions of glycogen metabolism, the specific activity of the high molecular weight fraction was significantly greater than that of the low molecular weight fraction. This difference was due to an almost 3-fold greater specific activity in the phosphorylase limit dextrin of the high molecular weight fraction. 3. By contrast, upon reduction of the glycogen level from 8% to approximately 1.5% and subsequent resynthesis of glycogen from 14C-glucose, the specific activity of the high molecular weight fraction was much lower than that of the low molecular weight fraction. 4. The relative rates of incorporation of 14C-glucose into glycogen as a function of the initial glycogen level were determined. 5. In any given glycogen sample, regardless of the glycogen level, the high and low molecular weight fractions had identical outer chain lengths and the same degree of branching. 6. The results obtained establish significant metabolic differences between the high and low molecular weight glycogen fractions."
https://openalex.org/W1480373108,"Abstract The use of uniformly labeled 14C-cytidine to preferentially label the ribosyl moiety of the purine nucleotides in growing cultures of Corynebacterium species has been shown. This organism was cultivated in a medium supplemented with uniformly labeled 14C-cytidine and the bacterial growth stopped while the cultures were still in the logarithmic phase. The entire 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-substituted pteridine pool was isolated, purified, and degraded. The specific radioactivity of carbon atoms 6 and 7 and carbon 9 was determined. Guanylic acid was isolated from the bacterial ribonucleic acid and the specific radioactivity of the ribosyl moiety was determined. The average specific radioactivity of the individual carbon atoms from the ribosyl moiety of guanylic acid was shown to agree very closely with the specific radioactivity of carbon atoms 6,7, and 9 of the pteridines. It is concluded that carbon atoms 6, 7, and 9 of folic acid originate as carbon atoms 2', 1', and 3', respectively, of the ribosyl moiety of guanylic acid. The implications of these findings as regards the biosynthesis of the 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-substituted pteridines is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1486549433,"Abstract Increasing levels of urea increase the fluorescence intensity of bovine growth hormone at neutral pH and shift the pH zone of the transition that occurs in acid to higher pH values. Maxima in the fluorescence intensity curves occur above 3.6 m urea and are displaced to higher pH values at higher urea concentrations. Fluorescence polarization of the conjugate of the hormone with 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl chloride undergoes a complicated series of changes as a function of urea concentration and pH. The pK value of the dimethylamino group of the 1-dimethylaminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl conjugate of bovine growth hormone is abnormally low in aqueous solution and is gradually normalized by urea. From studies of these phenomena, and of ultraviolet difference spectra of the hormone in urea solutions, five new molecular conformations of bovine growth hormone are inferred. Even the most disorganized conformation, which is found in 9 m urea below pH 5, still appears to retain some organized structure. The helical regions of the bovine growth hormone molecule appear to remain largely intact, even in conformations that differ markedly from that of the native molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1541668546,"Abstract An activation of tryptophan pyrrolase in vitro distinct from the previously known conversion of inactive apotryptophan pyrrolase to active holotryptophan pyrrolase by hematin or by boiled particulate fractions of liver is described. This stimulation occurs by the addition of small amounts of mitochondria or microsomes to cell sap in the presence of excess methemoglobin. The particulate activator is heat-sensitive, and its speed of action is dependent on temperature and concentration. Thus, three different levels of tryptophan pyrrolase activity can be obtained: (a) that in the absence of added cofactor, reflecting the endogenous holoenzyme; (b) that in the presence of added cofactor, reflecting the sum of endogenous holo- plus apotryptophan pyrrolase; and (c) that appearing after incubation with the mitochondria (or microsomes) plus a source of coenzyme, reflecting enzyme. In normal liver these three activities are approximately 1,2, and 5 units. In liver of rats 4 hours after administration of hydrocortisone or tryptophan the corresponding values are 4, 7, 25 and 10, 11, 12, respectively. Thus, both the substrate and the hormone raise in vivo the level of total obtainable tryptophan pyrrolase activity. The difference between the two inducers is that hydrocortisone (unless its action is prevented by the administration of actinomycin) causes the accumulation of much activity revealed only by the heat-labile particulate activator, whereas after treatment with tryptophan there is very little of such latent enzyme or of the inactive apoenzyme. Tryptophan, if administered to hydrocortisone-treated rats 1 hour before assay, converts much of the accumulated inactive enzyme to the active form."

https://openalex.org/W1593850375,"Abstract 2,4-Dinitrophenol raised the basal metabolic rate of O2 consumption less in some hypothyroid rats (group A) than in others (group B) which responded like normal rats. A single, subcalorigenic dose of l-thyroxine, 5.2 ng per g, partly restored this response in basal metabolic rate in 3 hours in rats of group A. The function of their liver mitochondria differed according to the previous responses in vivo of the rats to dinitrophenol, and according to the degree of calorigenesis induced in vivo by dinitrophenol in rats pretreated 3 hours with l-thyroxine. The hormone acted rapidly in vivo on liver mitochondria to regulate their reactivity to dinitrophenol and their respiratory control."
https://openalex.org/W1590931082,"Abstract Iodine monochloride, labeled with 125I, iodinated ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid dissolved as hexadecyltrimethylammonium salts in anhydrous dimethylformamide or N-ethyl acetamide. In the case of RNA (polyuridylate, polycytidylate, and soluble RNA) 5-iodouridine 5'-phosphate, 8-iodoguanosine 5'-phosphate, and 5-iodocytidine 5'-phosphate are found. After 24 hours of reaction, 32% of UMP, 8% of GMP, and 9% of CMP residues in soluble RNA were found to be iodinated. In the case of DNA, after 24 hours of reaction, 8-iodo-dGMP and 5-iodo-dCMP represent 1.4 and 14%, respectively, of the parent nucleotides present. The use of ion exchange column chromatography and ion exchange paper in the analysis of the iodinated nucleotides present in enzymatic digests of the nucleic acids is described. These techniques provide a means of introducing radioactivity into preformed polynucleotides and of studying the influence of iodinated bases on the biological activity of nucleic acids."

https://openalex.org/W1482988555,"Reduced ferredoxin is capable of reducing nonenzymatically cyano-B12. Spectral studies have shown that B12r (a 1-electron reduced derivative of the vitamin) accumulates in the reaction although the formation of methyl-B12 was observed upon the addition of methyl iodide to the incubation. The data indicate that reduction of cyano-B12 by reduced ferredoxin results in the transient formation of B12s (a 2-electron reduced derivative), which is not stable under the conditions used, and oxidizes to the more stable B12r. Reduced ferredoxin is able to supply the reducing-capability necessary for the enzymatic conversion of cyano-B12 to deoxyadenosyl-B12."

https://openalex.org/W1538689468,"Abstract The ability of inositol-deficient KB cells to use purine bases and nucleosides for the biosynthesis of nucleotides and nucleic acids was studied with the aid of 8-14C-adenine and 8-14C-guanosine. The rate of incorporation of 8-14C-adenine into the ribonucleic acid of deficient cells was at least 50% of the normal value even though the specific activities of the RNA bases were the same as those of normal cells. When 8-14C-guanosine was the radioactive precursor, the rate of labeling of the acid-soluble guanine and adenine nucleotides of deficient cells was one-half of that of normal cells. Similarly, the rate of incorporation of 8-14C-guanosine into RNA guanine and adenine of the deficient cells was 25% and 37%, respectively, of the normal rate. As a consequence of this, the specific activities of the RNA bases of the deficient cells were lower than those of normal cells. In the presence of nucleotide precursors, cells grown without inositol showed a decreased rate of cell division while maintaining approximately a normal rate of nucleic acid biosynthesis. This results in cells containing increased levels of nucleic acids. The levels of guanase and nucleoside phosphorylase activities of deficient cells were the same as those of normal cells, but the level of guanosine 5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase activity was reduced to 40% of the normal value. The loss of intracellular purine compounds into the culture fluid was very small, and it was the same in both types of cells. It is concluded that inositol-deficient cells are unable to incorporate adenine and guanosine into the nucleic acids at a normal rate, and that inositol deficiency affects more the metabolism of guanosine by causing a decrease of the level of GMP pyrophosphorylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2037997048,"Surgical removal of the pituitary gland had little apparent effect on the distribution or morphology of skin and feather polysomes in chicken embryos incubated for 12 days. However, polysome patterns obtained from 15-day-old hypophysectomized embryos differed markedly from those of their controls. In addition, a tetrad-shaped polysome, characteristic of the 158S peak of the 12-day-old embryo but not of the 15-day-old control, is still retained in the operated embryo at 15 days. Therefore, it appears that after day 12 of embryogenesis the structure of the four-ribosome polysome from skin and feathers is contingent on a functional hypophysis."
https://openalex.org/W1492752866,"2,4,7-Trihydroxypteridine is readily accessible from folic acid and other naturally occurring pteridines by way of 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine-6-carboxylic acid, 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine, and isoxanthopterin (2-amino-4,7-dihydroxypteridine). After irradiation with ultraviolet light and brief acid hydrolysis, 2,4,7-trihydroxypteridine gives rise to glyoxylic acid coming from carbon atoms 6 and 7 of the pteridine ring. A detailed method is described suitable for use on a micro scale in the study of the biosynthetic origin of these carbon atoms in pteridines."
https://openalex.org/W1596185635,"Abstract The rate at which Mg2+ dissociates from the catalytically active magnesium-enzyme-substrate complex is much smaller than the catalytic rate in the phosphoglucomutase system. This observation was used in designing an all-or-none type of assay to distinguish between the free enzyme and its Mg2+ complex, and hence to measure the dissociation constant for the Mg2+ complex of phosphoglucomutase."
https://openalex.org/W1595081325,"Abstract A study of the time sequence of the various metabolic changes occurring in KB cells during growth in inositol-deficient medium is presented. The earliest detectable change was a decrease of the cellular concentration of acidsoluble nucleotides and ribonucleic acid. The levels of guanosine 5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase, adenosine 5'-phosphate pyrophosphorylase, and 5-phosphoribose pyrophosphokinase activities showed a marked transient increase coinciding with the cessation of cell multiplication, followed by a rapid and pronounced decrease. There was a progressive decrease of the level of nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity throughout inositol deficiency which was observed with all substrates except uridine 5'-diphosphate, the enzymatic hydrolysis of which was unaffected by inositol deficiency. The levels of nucleotidase, inosine 5'-phosphate dehydrogenase, and xanthosine 5'-phosphate aminase activities remained essentially unchanged throughout the deficiency period."
