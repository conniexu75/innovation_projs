Recently, mutations inNod2 have been shown to be associated with Crohn's disease, suggesting a role for bacteria-host interactions in the etiology of this disorder. We show here that Nod2 is a general sensor of peptidoglycan through the recognition of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria. Moreover, the 3020insC frameshift mutation, the most frequent Nod2 variant associated with Crohn's disease patients, fully abrogates Nod2-dependent detection of peptidoglycan and MDP. Together, these results impact on the understanding of Crohn's disease development. Additionally, the characterization of Nod2 as the first pathogen-recognition molecule that detects MDP will help to unravel the well known biological activities of this immunomodulatory compound.

Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract. The development of this disease is known to be influenced by both environmental factors and genetic predisposition. A significant advance in the understanding of this disease was achieved by the identification of Nod2/CARD15 as the first susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease in Caucasian populations (1Hugot J.P.

Nod2 belongs to the recently described family of intracellular Nod proteins, which contain a nucleotide-binding site domain flanked by a leucine-rich repeat domain (3Girardin S.E. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 193-199Google Scholar, 4Inohara N. Ogura Y. Nunez G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 76-80Google Scholar). Among this family, proteins such as Nod1/CARD4 and Nod2 detect bacterial products to induce the activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways, such as the NF-κB pathway (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K.

The critical importance of the Nods in inflammatory processes is further reinforced by the recent characterization of Nod2 andNalp3 as susceptibility genes for five hereditary inflammatory disorders (1Hugot J.P.

Since bacterial products have been shown to activate Nod2 (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar), the implication of Nod2 in Crohn's disease may support the hypothesis that enteric bacteria-host interactions could have an etiological role in this disorder. However, the precise characterization of the bacterial motifs detected by Nod2 remains to be addressed. In this study, we aimed to examine the sensitivity of Nod2 toward different peptidoglycans (PGNs), 1The abbreviations used are: PGN, peptidoglycan; MDP, muramyl dipeptide; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; TA, teichoic acid; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern a cell wall product common to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Our results show that Nod2 senses muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is the minimal PGN motif common to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These findings impact on our current understanding of the etiology of Crohn's disease. Additionally, these data will contribute to the elucidation of the mode of action of MDP, an immunomodulatory agent used for decades in adjuvant preparations. Bacterial strains used to prepare PGN were as follows: Escherichia coli K12, Shigella flexneri 5a M90T (wild type), and Bacillus subtilis168, Staphylococcus aureus COL (from Olivier Chesneau, Institut Pasteur). PGNs of E. coli and S. flexneri were purified as described by Glauner et al.(11Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Google Scholar). PGNs of B. subtilis and S. aureus were purified as described by de Jonge et al. (12de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were harvested in exponential growth phase at an optical density (600 nm) of 0.4–0.6 and quickly chilled in an ice-ethanol bath to minimize PGN hydrolysis by endogeneous autolysins. Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold water and added drop by drop to 8% SDS boiling. Samples were boiled for 30 min, allowing immediate inactivation of autolysins. Polymeric PGN, which is insoluble, was recovered by centrifugation and washed several times until no SDS could be detected. SDS assay was done as described by Hayashi (13Hayashi K. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 67: 503-506Google Scholar). SDS treatment removes contaminating proteins, non-covalently bound lipoproteins and LPS. Gram-positive samples were physically broken with acid washed glass beads (<100 nm). The PGN fraction was recovered by differential centrifugation to remove cellular debris. All PGNs were further treated with α-amylase to remove any glycogen and with trypsin (3× crystallized trypsin, Worthington) digestions to remove covalently bound proteins (LPXTG proteins in Gram-positive bacteria) or lipoproteins (Gram-negative bacteria). Samples were further boiled in 1% SDS to inactivate trypsin and were washed to remove SDS. Gram-positive samples were treated with 49% hydrofluoridic acid during 48 h at 4 °C. This mild acid hydrolysis allows removal of secondary polysaccharides covalently bound to the PGN by phosphodiester bonds such as teichoic acid, capsules, poly(β,1–6-GlcNAc), etc. Further treatment of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative PGNs included washes with 8 m LiCl, 0.1m EDTA to remove any polypeptidic contamination and with acetone to remove lipoteichoic acids or any traces of LPS. Samples were lyophilized to measure PGN amounts. Purity of samples was assessed by HPLC amino acid and saccharide analysis after HCl hydrolysis (14Atherton D. Hugli T.E. Techniques in Protein Chemistry. Academic Press, New York1989: 273Google Scholar). HEK293T and HeLa epithelial cells, and RAW macrophage cells, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Prior to transfection, HEK293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml as described previously (5Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Google Scholar). MDP LD and MDP LL were from Calbiochem and reported to be 98% pure by TLC. LPS was fromE. coli O111:B4 (Sigma), commercial S. aureus PGN was from Fluka, and TNFα was from R & D Systems. The expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged Nod1 was from Gabriel Nuñez (University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI) and has been described previously (15Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Google Scholar). For Nod2, a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library (λ Zap ExpressTM/EcoRI vector, Stratagene, catalog number 938202), kindly provided by S. Gisselbrecht (Paris), was screened for Nod2-expressing clones (GenBankTM/EBI accession number CAC42117). A full-length Nod2-expressing vector was verified by complete automatic sequencing and inserted into pBKCMV (Stratagene). The Nod2 3020InsC frameshift mutation was subsequently introduced using QuikChange XL site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The entire coding region was verified by sequencing and the size of the encoded product was verified by immunoblotting. Transfections were carried out in HEK293T cells as described previously (5Girardin S.E. Tournebize R. Mavris M. Page A.L. Li X. Stark G.R. Bertin J. DiStefano P.S. Yaniv M. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 736-742Google Scholar). Studies examining the synergistic activation of NF-κB by peptidoglycans or MDPs in cells overexpressing Nod2 were carried out as described by Inohara et al. (6Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with 30 ng of Nod2 plus 75 ng of Igκ luciferase reporter plasmid. At the same time, 1 μg of PGN preparations or MDPs were added, and the synergistic NF-κB-dependent luciferase activation was then measured following 24 h of co-incubation. NF-κB-dependent luciferase assays were performed in duplicate, and data represent at least three independent experiments. Data show mean ± S.E. For immunofluorescence studies, NF-κB activation was assessed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in HeLa cells and RAW macrophages following microinjection of MDPs as described previously (16Philpott D.J. Yamaoka S. Israel A. Sansonetti P.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 903-914Google Scholar). At least 50 microinjected cells were examined per coverslip, and experiments were performed at least two times independently with similar results. Previous studies demonstrated that Nod2 can be activated by commercial PGN from Staphyloccocus aureus and LPSs from various Gram-negative bacteria (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar, 6Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar). We aimed to investigate the sensing specificity of Nod2 toward PGNs from Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. Indeed, even though Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria contain PGN, its organization and structure differ substantially between these two groups (17Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Google Scholar). Therefore, PGNs from E. coli, S. flexneri, B. subtilis, and S. aureus were purified according to experimental procedures specifically designed for Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria (11Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Google Scholar, 12de Jonge B.L. Chang Y.S. Gage D. Tomasz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11248-11254Google Scholar). These harsh purification steps are well suited for the elimination of the possible contaminants, such as LPS (through SDS treatments), lipoproteins (through SDS and trypsin treatments), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), teichoic acid (TA), capsule (through HF treatment of Gram-positive PGN). Indeed, amino acid and saccharide analysis of the purified PGNs following HPLC revealed the absence of amino acids or amino sugars other than those related to PGN, thus excluding the possibility that contaminant polypeptidic residues remained at the end of our purification procedures (data not shown). Equivalent amounts of purified PGNs (1 μg) were then added to cells transiently transfected with Nod2, and the subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathway was measured using a NF-κB-driven luciferase reporter gene assay. As demonstrated previously (6Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar), transfection of low amounts (30 ng) of Nod2 itself results in a moderate action of NF-κB (∼5-fold over vector-expressing cells). We observed that PGN preparations from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria were similarly efficient in potentiating the Nod2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig.1 a), suggesting that Nod2 is a general sensor of PGNs. To completely eliminate the possibility that trace amounts of contaminants in the PGN preparations could be responsible for some of the Nod2-dependent activation of NF-κB, PGNs from E. coli and S. aureus were subjected to additional incubation with polymyxin B or proteinase K and boiling. These treatments did not lead to any change in the Nod2-dependent stimulation of the NF-κB pathway compared with the non-treated PGNs (Fig. 1 b). These observations prompted us to define what is the minimal PGN compound that would be common to both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and could activate Nod2. The sugar backbone of PGN is made of chains of repeating disaccharide units composed of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) β-1,4 linked to N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Additionally, the MurNAc residues are substituted with shortdl-amino acid peptides (Fig. 1 c). Since GlcNAc is a sugar moiety also found in LPS, LTA, TA, and other complex polysaccharides, this sugar is unlikely to account for specific PGN sensing by Nod2. On the contrary, the MurNAc substituted with two amino acids, known as muramyl dipeptide (MDP LD or simply MDP), corresponds to the minimal PGN signature found in all bacteria. We took advantage of the availability of chemically synthesized MDP, thus avoiding the risk of contamination by other bacterial products. We observed that addition of MDP could strongly enhance Nod2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig. 1 d). To test the specificity of the synergistic activation of Nod2 by MDP, we tested whether Nod1, another Nod molecule closely related to Nod2, could also sense MDP. Strikingly, Nod1-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway was completely insensitive to MDP (Fig. 1 d). Since TLR2 has been shown to be implicated in PGN detection (18Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Takada H. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Google Scholar), we investigated whether it could sense MDP. Extracellular stimulation of TLR2-transfected cells with MDP (1 μg) failed to potentiate the TLR2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig.1 d), while addition of commercial preparations of S. aureus PGN could do so (data not shown). This result suggests either that TLR2 might require other yet unknown structural PGN motifs to achieve recognition, or, alternatively, that co-receptors would be required for this recognition. Therefore, Nod2 is the only pathogen-recognition molecule identified so far that detects PGN through MDP, its minimal invariant motif. MDP has been studied extensively in the past 2 decades because of its immunostimulatory properties (19Chedid L. Microbiol. Immunol. 1983; 27: 723-732Google Scholar). It is also well documented that the biological activity of this molecule is completely abolished if its second amino acid, d-Glx, is replaced by thel-Glx enantiomer (MDP LL). We therefore investigated whether Nod2 could detect the biologically inactive MDP LL to the same extent as MDP. Chemically synthesized MDP LL (1 μg) was then added to Nod2-transfected cells, and in these conditions we detected no synergistic activation of the Nod2-dependent NF-κB pathway by MDP LL (Fig. 1 d). Even though we cannot exclude that pathogen-recognition molecules distinct from Nod2 could also detect MDP, these observations strongly suggest that Nod2 plays a key role in mediating the biological activities of MDP. In contrast to Nod1, which is expressed in virtually all adult tissues (15Inohara N. Koseki T. del Peso L. Hu Y. Yee C. Chen S. Carrio R. Merino J. Liu D. Ni J. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14560-14567Google Scholar, 20Bertin J. Nir W.J. Fischer C.M. Tayber O.V. Errada P.R. Grant J.R. Keilty J.J. Gosselin M.L. Robison K.E. Wong G.H. Glucksmann M.A. DiStefano P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12955-12958Google Scholar), the expression of Nod2 is predominantly in monocytes derived from peripheral blood leukocytes (21Ogura Y. Inohara N. Benito A. Chen F.F. Yamaoka S. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4812-4818Google Scholar). In epithelial cells, Nod2 expression remains below detection limits in basal conditions (Ref. 22Gutierrez O. Pipaon C. Inohara N. Fontalba A. Ogura Y. Prosper F. Nunez G. Fernandez-Luna J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41701-41705Google Scholarand data not shown). Therefore, we took advantage of this restricted expression profile to compare the sensitivity of epithelial cells and macrophages toward MDP stimulation. To this end, macrophages or epithelial cells were stimulated with MDP LD or MDP LL, and the activation of the NF-κB pathway was assessed by immunostaining through the detection of nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit in activated cells. Epithelial cells and macrophages were first stimulated by extracellular addition of MDP LD or MDP LL. In neither case could we observe any activation of the NF-κB pathway (Fig.2 a). As positive controls, epithelial cells and macrophages were stimulated by TNFα and LPS, respectively. Therefore, these results suggest that none of these cells possess pathogen-recognition molecules at their plasma membrane that could detect MDP and trigger downstream signaling pathways. As macrophages express most of the TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4, this observation is consistent with our findings that TLR2 is unable to detect MDP. Since Nod2 is a cytoplasmic protein, we investigated whether MDP detection could occur inside microinjected cells. Epithelial cells and macrophages were then microinjected with MDP LD or MDP LL together with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran, to track microinjected cells. While neither epithelial cells nor macrophages were stimulated by intracellular presentation of MDP LL, 80% of MDP LD-microinjected macrophages displayed activation of the NF-κB pathway as observed by nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 subunit (Fig. 2 b). In contrast, 100% of MDP LD-microinjected epithelial cells remained NF-κB-inactive (Fig. 2 b). Together, these results are in agreement with our observation that Nod2, which is an intracellular pathogen-recognition molecule expressed in macrophages, detects MDP LD but not MDP LL. Moreover, these observations demonstrate that epithelial cells, which do not express Nod2, do not possess an additional pathogen-recognition molecule distinct from Nod2 that could either extracellularly or intracellularly detect MDP. Following the discovery of Nod2 as a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease, a critical issue is now to understand how mutations that affect Nod2 can account for development of the disease. As Nod2 is a pathogen-recognition molecule, it is therefore of interest to investigate whether Nod2 mutants found in Crohn's disease patients display an altered ability to detect bacterial products. Indeed, previous studies had suggested that Nod2 variants found in Crohn's disease displayed an altered sensitivity toward LPS detection (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar). Our findings that Nod2 is a general sensor of PGNs through the detection of MDP prompted us to investigate whether PGN or MDP sensing was altered in a Crohn's disease-associated Nod2 mutant. To this end, we compared the ability of wild-type Nod2 and Nod2 3020InsC (Nod2fs), the most frequent Nod2 variant found associated with Crohn's disease patients, to detect PGNs from Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria (Fig.3 a). Strikingly, while Nod2fs could activate the NF-κB pathway as well as wild-type Nod2 when overexpressed, which is consistent with previous reports (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar), the activation of the NF-κB pathway by Nod2fs was absolutely not potentiated by the addition of any PGN, thus showing that Nod2fs is unable to detect PGNs. This defect in PGN sensing was further illustrated by the fact that Nod2fs is also deficient in detecting MDP (Fig. 3 b). Therefore, these results suggest that defects in MDP sensing influence the development of Crohn's disease in patients with Nod2 mutations. Innate immunity to microbial pathogens relies on the specific detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by specific host receptors (3Girardin S.E. Sansonetti P.J. Philpott D.J. Trends Microbiol. 2002; 10: 193-199Google Scholar). A major difficulty concerning the identification of which PAMP is detected by a specific pathogen-recognition molecule resides in the fact that most of these products need to be purified from bacterial cell walls, and therefore contamination with other cell wall components can often occur and may lead to erroneous conclusions. As our aim was to investigate the sensing specificity of Nod2 toward PGNs, we adapted the most stringent purification protocols for PGN preparations to obtain the highest purity. Using these purified PGN preparations, we were able to show that Nod2 is a general sensor of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive PGN. Previous studies showed that Nod2 displayed varying sensitivities toward different commercial LPSs (2Ogura Y. Bonen D.K. Inohara N. Nicolae D.L. Chen F.F. Ramos R. Britton H. Moran T. Karaliuskas R. Duerr R.H. Achkar J.P. Brant S.R. Bayless T.M. Kirschner B.S. Hanauer S.B. Nunez G. Cho J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 603-606Google Scholar, 6Inohara N. Ogura Y. Chen F.F. Muto A. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2551-2554Google Scholar), which, in light of our data, suggests that these preparations could be contaminated more or less with PGN, and this possibility remains to be addressed. Over the last decades, muramyl peptides and other synthetic derivatives of this molecule have been reported to be potent immunoadjuvants that enhance protective immunity against pathogens and tumors by stimulating immune-competent cells, such as monocytes and macrophages (19Chedid L. Microbiol. Immunol. 1983; 27: 723-732Google Scholar, 23Vidal V.F. Casteran N. Riendeau C.J. Kornfeld H. Darcissac E.C. Capron A. Bahr G.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1962-1971Google Scholar). Despite a long standing investigation in the field of muramyl peptides, little is known about their interaction with target cells and their mode of action. Indeed, the nature of the MDP-sensing molecule(s) has been a subject of controversy (23Vidal V.F. Casteran N. Riendeau C.J. Kornfeld H. Darcissac E.C. Capron A. Bahr G.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1962-1971Google Scholar, 24Weidemann B. Schletter J. Dziarski R. Kusumoto S. Stelter F. Rietschel E.T. Flad H.D. Ulmer A.J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 858-864Google Scholar, 25Wolfert M.A. Murray T.F. Boons G.J. Moore J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39179-39186Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been also reported that MDP binding sites are located within the intracellular compartment (26Sumaroka M.V. Litvinov I.S. Khaidukov S.V. Golovina T.N. Kamraz M.V. Komal'eva R.L. Andronova T.M. Makarov E.A. Nesmeyanov V.A. Ivanov V.T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 48-50Google Scholar). Our results have defined Nod2 as an intracellular sensor of MDP, which is in agreement with many of the known biological properties of MDP. First, Nod2 expression is restricted to monocytes/macrophages in basal conditions, which is the major cell population stimulated by MDP. Second, the fact that the MDP sensor is actually intracellular correlates with the characterization of cytoplasmic MDP binding sites (26Sumaroka M.V. Litvinov I.S. Khaidukov S.V. Golovina T.N. Kamraz M.V. Komal'eva R.L. Andronova T.M. Makarov E.A. Nesmeyanov V.A. Ivanov V.T. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 48-50Google Scholar) and would explain why extracellular presentation of MDP in the absence of lipidic emulsifying compounds such as liposomes or paraffin oil (the base of Freund's preparation) is poorly immunostimulatory (27Alving C.R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 140: 1-13Google Scholar). Indeed, it can now be hypothesized that lipidic moieties might be required to allow MDP to cross the hydrophobic plasma membrane. The homeostasis of the intestine relies on a finely tuned surveillance system mediated by mononuclear cells, including monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells that are permanent residents of the intestinal mucosa. The constant presence of luminal antigens maintains the tissue in a state of physiological inflammation through a tightly controlled equilibrium that balances pro- versus anti-inflammatory signals. Indeed, the discovery that Nod2-dependent activation of the NF-κB pro-inflammatory cascade is modulated by PGN sensing in these cells highlights the essential role of Nod2 in the maintenance of mucosal homeostasis. In Crohn's disease patients carrying mutations in Nod2, the manifestation of pathology is then likely to be related to a defect in mononuclear-driven homeostasis at the level of the intestinal mucosa. Our discovery of MDP as the bacterial ligand that initiates Nod2-dependent signaling and the insensitivity of a Crohn's disease-associated Nod2 mutation to this bacterial product underscores the critical role of bacterial sensing by Nod2 in intestinal mucosal homeostasis. Therefore, it will be of interest to examine whether some of the Nod2-independent Crohn's disease susceptibility alleles are associated with defects in pathways that are involved in the processing of PGN, such as lysozyme in the endosomal compartment. We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Muguette Jéhanno as well as Martine Parmier who helped with plasmid preparations. We also acknowledge Didier Blanot for the amino acid and saccharide analysis of the PGN samples. We thank those individuals that donated bacterial strains and plasmids.

https://openalex.org/W2064656497,"How and when memory T cells form during an immune response are long-standing questions. To better understand memory CD8 T cell development, a time course of gene expression and functional changes in antigen-specific T cells during viral infection was evaluated. The expression of many genes continued to change after viral clearance in accordance with changes in CD8 T cell functional properties. Even though memory cell precursors were present at the peak of the immune response, these cells did not display hallmark functional traits of memory T cells. However, these cells gradually acquired the memory cell qualities of self-renewal and rapid recall to antigen suggesting the model that antigen-specific CD8 T cells progressively differentiate into memory cells following viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2064489231,"Mutations in the Arabidopsis ROS1 locus cause transcriptional silencing of a transgene and a homologous endogenous gene. In the ros1 mutants, the promoter of the silenced loci is hypermethylated, which may be triggered by small RNAs produced from the transgene repeats. The transcriptional silencing in ros1 mutants can be released by the ddm1 mutation or the application of the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. ROS1 encodes an endonuclease III domain nuclear protein with bifunctional DNA glycosylase/lyase activity against methylated but not unmethylated DNA. The ros1 mutant shows enhanced sensitivity to genotoxic agents methyl methanesulfonate and hydrogen peroxide. We suggest that ROS1 is a DNA repair protein that represses homology-dependent transcriptional gene silencing by demethylating the target promoter DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2030102659,"How a neuron becomes polarized remains an outstanding question. Here, we report that selection of the future axon among neurites of a cultured hippocampal neuron requires the activity of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), as well as atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). The PI 3-kinase activity, highly localized to the tip of the newly specified axon of stage 3 neurons, is essential for the proper subcellular localization of mPar3, the mammalian homolog of C. elegans polarity protein Par3. Polarized distribution of not only mPar3 but also mPar6 is important for axon formation; ectopic expression of mPar6 or mPar3, or just the N terminus of mPar3, leaves neurons with no axon specified. Thus, neuronal polarity is likely to be controlled by the mPar3/mPar6/aPKC complex and the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway, both serving evolutionarily conserved roles in specifying cell polarity."
https://openalex.org/W2046700952,"Increased leukocyte elastase activity in mice lacking secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) leads to impaired wound healing due to enhanced activity of TGFβ and perhaps additional mechanisms. Proepithelin (PEPI), an epithelial growth factor, can be converted to epithelins (EPIs) in vivo by unknown mechanisms with unknown consequences. We found that PEPI and EPIs exert opposing activities. EPIs inhibit the growth of epithelial cells but induce them to secrete the neutrophil attractant IL-8, while PEPI blocks neutrophil activation by tumor necrosis factor, preventing release of oxidants and proteases. SLPI and PEPI form complexes, preventing elastase from converting PEPI to EPIs. Supplying PEPI corrects the wound-healing defect in SLPI null mice. Thus, SLPI/elastase act via PEPI/EPIs to operate a switch at the interface between innate immunity and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1967743500,"Conditions that partially inhibit DNA replication induce expression of common fragile sites. These sites form gaps and breaks on metaphase chromosomes and are deleted and rearranged in many tumors. Yet, the mechanism of fragile site expression has been elusive. We demonstrate that the replication checkpoint kinase ATR, but not ATM, is critical for maintenance of fragile site stability. ATR deficiency results in fragile site expression with and without addition of replication inhibitors. Thus, we propose that fragile sites are unreplicated chromosomal regions resulting from stalled forks that escape the ATR replication checkpoint. These findings have important implications for understanding both the mechanism of fragile site instability and the consequences of stalled replication in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062867249,"The capacity for declarative memory depends on the hippocampal region and adjacent cortex within the medial temporal lobe. One of the most widely studied examples of declarative memory is the capacity to recognize recently encountered material as familiar, but uncertainty remains about whether intact recognition memory depends on the hippocampal region itself and, if so, what the nature of the hippocampal contribution might be. Seven patients with bilateral damage thought to be limited primarily to the hippocampal region were impaired on three standard tests of recognition memory. In addition, the patients were impaired to a similar extent at Remembering and Knowing, measures of the two processes thought to support recognition performance: the ability to remember the learning episode (episodic recollection) and the capacity for judging items as familiar (familiarity)."
https://openalex.org/W1967115518,"Notch and its ligands are modified by a protein O-fucosyltransferase (OFUT1) that attaches fucose to a Serine or Threonine within EGF domains. By using RNAi to decrease Ofut1 expression in Drosophila, we demonstrate that O-linked fucose is positively required for Notch signaling, including both Fringe-dependent and Fringe-independent processes. The requirement for Ofut1 is cell autonomous, in the signal-receiving cell, and upstream of Notch activation. The transcription of Ofut1 is developmentally regulated, and surprisingly, overexpression of Ofut1 inhibits Notch signaling. Together, these results indicate that OFUT1 is a core component of the Notch pathway, which is required for the activation of Notch by its ligands, and whose regulation may contribute to the pattern of Notch activation during development."
https://openalex.org/W100225602,"Nuclear localization of p53 is essential for its tumor suppressor function. Here, we have identified Parc, a Parkin-like ubiquitin ligase, as a cytoplasmic anchor protein in p53-associated protein complexes. Parc directly interacts and forms a approximately 1 MDa complex with p53 in the cytoplasm of unstressed cells. In the absence of stress, inactivation of Parc induces nuclear localization of endogenous p53 and activates p53-dependent apoptosis. Overexpression of Parc promotes cytoplasmic sequestration of ectopic p53. Furthermore, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of p53 was observed in a number of neuroblastoma cell lines; RNAi-mediated reduction of endogenous Parc significantly sensitizes these neuroblastoma cells in the DNA damage response. These results reveal that Parc is a critical regulator in controlling p53 subcellular localization and subsequent function."
https://openalex.org/W1986458631,"Analysis of meiotic recombination by functional genomic approaches reveals prominent spatial and functional interactions among diverse organizational determinants. Recombination occurs between chromatin loop sequences; however, these sequences are spatially tethered to underlying chromosome axes via their recombinosomes. Meiotic chromosomal protein, Red1, localizes to chromosome axes; however, Red1 loading is modulated by R/G-bands isochores and thus by bulk chromatin state. Recombination is also modulated by isochore determinants: R-bands differentially favor double-strand break (DSB) formation but disfavor subsequent loading of meiotic RecA homolog, Dmc1. Red1 promotes DSB formation in both R- and G-bands and then promotes Dmc1 loading, specifically counteracting disfavoring R-band effects. These complexities are discussed in the context of chiasma formation as a series of coordinated local changes at the DNA and chromosome-axis levels."
https://openalex.org/W1963556856,"We identified the Grp gene, encoding gastrin-releasing peptide, as being highly expressed both in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the nucleus where associations for Pavlovian learned fear are formed, and in the regions that convey fearful auditory information to the lateral nucleus. Moreover, we found that GRP receptor (GRPR) is expressed in GABAergic interneurons of the lateral nucleus. GRP excites these interneurons and increases their inhibition of principal neurons. GRPR-deficient mice showed decreased inhibition of principal neurons by the interneurons, enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP), and greater and more persistent long-term fear memory. By contrast, these mice performed normally in hippocampus-dependent Morris maze. These experiments provide genetic evidence that GRP and its neural circuitry operate as a negative feedback regulating fear and establish a causal relationship between Grpr gene expression, LTP, and amygdala-dependent memory for fear."
https://openalex.org/W1975363648,"Diverse cell types and parallel pathways are characteristic of the vertebrate nervous system, yet it remains a challenge to define the basic components of most neural structures. We describe a process termed retrograde photodynamics that allowed us to rapidly make the link between morphology, physiology, and connectivity for ganglion cells in the macaque retina that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Rhodamine dextran injected into the LGN was transported retrogradely and sequestered within the cytoplasm of ganglion cell bodies. Exposure of the retina to light in vitro liberated the tracer and allowed it to diffuse throughout the dendrites, revealing the cell's complete morphology. Eight previously unknown LGN-projecting cell types were identified. Cells could also be targeted in vitro for intracellular recording and physiological analysis. The photodynamic process was also observed in pyramidal cells in a rat neocortical slice."

However, the cellular pathway used by Nef to downregulate MHC-I is unknown. Here, we show that Nef and PACS-1 combine to usurp the ARF6 endocytic pathway by a PI3K-dependent process and downregulate cell surface MHC-I to the TGN. This mechanism requires the hierarchical actions of three Nef motifs-the acidic cluster 62EEEE(65), the SH3 domain binding site 72PXXP(75), and M(20)-in controlling PACS-1-dependent sorting to the TGN, ARF6 activation, and sequestering internalized MHC-I to the TGN, respectively.

The listerial protein internalin (InlA) mediates bacterial adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells in the human intestine through specific interaction with its host cell receptor E-cadherin. We present the crystal structures of the functional domain of InlA alone and in a complex with the extracellular, N-terminal domain of human E-cadherin (hEC1). The leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain of InlA surrounds and specifically recognizes hEC1. Individual interactions were probed by mutagenesis and analytical ultracentrifugation. These include Pro16 of hEC1, a major determinant for human susceptibility to L. monocytogenes infection that is essential for intermolecular recognition. Our studies reveal the structural basis for host tro-pism of this bacterium and the molecular deception L. monocytogenes employs to exploit the E-cadherin system."

To characterize Netrin signaling, we generated a gain-of-function UNC-40 molecule, MYR::UNC-40. MYR::UNC-40 causes axon guidance defects, excess axon branching, and excessive axon and cell body outgrowth. These defects are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in ced-10 (a Rac GTPase), unc-34 (an Enabled homolog), and unc-115 (a putative actin binding protein). ced-10, unc-34, and unc-115 also function in endogenous unc-40 signaling. Our results indicate that Enabled functions in axonal attraction as well as axon repulsion. UNC-40 has two conserved cytoplasmic motifs that mediate distinct downstream pathways: CED-10, UNC-115, and the UNC-40 P2 motif act in one pathway, and UNC-34 and the UNC-40 P1 motif act in the other. Thus, UNC-40 might act as a scaffold to deliver several independent signals to the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W1987211464,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) open when extracellular pH drops and they are enhanced by lactate, making them specialized for detecting lactic acidosis. Highly expressed on cardiac nociceptors and some other sensory neurons, ASICs may help trigger pain caused by tissue ischemia. We report that H(+) opens ASIC3 by speeding release of Ca(2+) from a high-affinity binding site (K(Ca) = 150 nM) on the extracellular side of the pore. The bound Ca(2+) blocks permeation and the channel conducts when multiple H(+) ions relieve this block. Activation through Ca(2+) explains sensitivity to lactate, which decreases extracellular [Ca(2+)], and it may prove relevant in CNS pathologies (stroke, seizure) that simultaneously drop pH and Ca(2+)."
https://openalex.org/W2013733365,"Guggulipid is an extract of the guggul treeCommiphora mukul and has been widely used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans. The plant sterol guggulsterone (GS) is the active agent in this extract. Recent studies have shown that GS can act as an antagonist ligand for farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and decrease expression of bile acid-activated genes. Here we show that GS, although an FXR antagonist in coactivator association assays, enhances FXR agonist-induced transcription of bile salt export pump (BSEP), a major hepatic bile acid transporter. In HepG2 cells, in the presence of an FXR agonist such as chenodeoxycholate or GW4064, GS enhanced endogenousBSEP expression with a maximum induction of 400–500% that induced by an FXR agonist alone. This enhancement was also readily observed in FXR-dependent BSEP promoter activation using a luciferase reporter construct. In addition, GS alone slightly increased BSEP promoter activation in the absence of an FXR agonist. Consistent with the results in HepG2, guggulipid treatment in Fisher rats increased BSEP mRNA. Interestingly, in these animals expression of the orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer partner), a known FXR target, was also significantly increased, whereas expression of other FXR targets including cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp 7a1), sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp 8b1), and the intestinal bile acid-binding protein (I-BABP), remained unchanged. Thus, we propose that GS is a selectivebile acid receptormodulator that regulates expression of a subset of FXR targets.

Cells were treated with Me2SO, 10 μm Z-GS, 0.1 μm GW4064 or 10 μm Z-GS plus 0.1 μm GW4064 for ∼24 h in fresh DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS. At the end of the incubation, nuclear extraction was prepared using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, 20 μg of total nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen). Western blotting was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences) using the polyclonal rabbit anti-human FXR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL chemiluminescence kit were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences. HepG2 cells were transfected in 96-well plates using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as previously described (29Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Li Y. Schaeffer J.M. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25963-25969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Transfection mixtures for each well contained 0.405 μl of FuGENE 6, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hFXR, 10.4 ng of pcDNA3.1-hRXRα, 10.4 ng of pGL3-enhancer-hBSEP-Promoter-Luc, and 103.8 ng of pCMV-lacZ. The treatment of transfected cells with various FXR ligands, assays for luciferase, and β-galactosidase activities were also following the same protocols as previously described (29Cui J. Heard T.S.

This assay was performed at Merck Sharp and Dohme de España, Spain. HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 5 mm HEPES. For determination of gene-specific expression by TaqMan analysis, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 25 mm HEPES. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were treated with various concentrations of compounds in DMEM containing 0.5% CS-FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 25 mm HEPES. Unless specified, cells were treated for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells or rat tissues using the TRIZOL reagent according the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription reactions and TaqMan PCRs were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific amplification was detected with an increased fluorescent signal of FAM (reporter dye) during the amplification cycles. Amplification of human 18 S RNA was used in the same reaction of all samples as an internal control. Gene-specific mRNA was subsequently normalized to 18 S RNA. Levels of human BSEP mRNA were expressed as -fold difference of compound-treated cells against Me2SO-treated cells. Levels of rat BSEP, SHP, andI-BABP were expressed as -fold difference of GUGGUL-treated animals against control animals. Oligonucleotide primers and probes for human and murine BSEP were designed using the Primer Express program and were synthesized by Applied Biosystems. These sequences (5′ to 3′) are as follows: human BSEP, forward primer (GGGCCATTGTACGAGATCCTAA), probe (6FAM-TCTTGCTACTAGATGAAGCCACTTCTGCCTTAGA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (TGCACCGTCTTTTCACTTTCTG); rat BSEP, forward primer (GATGAAGCTACGTCTGCCCTAGAC), probe (6FAM-CATTGTCATTGCTCATCGTTTGTCCACC-TAMRA), and reverse primer (GACACGACAGCAATGATATCTGAGTT); rat SHP(AGCTTGGATTTCCTCGGTTTG), probe (6FAM-ATACAGTGTTTGACTAACTGTCCAGCAG-TAMRA), and reverse primer (GAGGTTTTGGGAGCCATCAA); rat I-BABP, forward primer (GGGCAACATCATGAGCAACA), probe (6FAM-ATTGGCAAAGAATGTGAAATGCAGACCATG-TAMRA), and reverse primer (TCACGGTTGCCTTGAACTTCT); rat Cyp 7a1, forward primer (CGCCCTAGCGACTGGATTAG), probe (6FAM-AAGAACTTTGTTCTCGCTGCCCACATTCC-TAMRA), and reverse primer (GGCCCCAGCTATGTGAACA); rat Cyp 8b1, forward primer (AGCTCCCATGAGTCAAACAGTATCT), probe (6FAM-TGCCTCAGCCCATCCTACCTGCCTTA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (AGGATTTGGAGTAAGGGCATCA); human ABCA1, forward primer (GAGGATGTCCAGTCCAGTAATGGT), probe (6FAM-ACACCTGGAGAGAAGCTTTCAACGAGACTAACC-TAMRA), and reverse primer (AGCGAGATATGGTCCGGATTG); human ABCG1, forward primer (TGCAATCTTGTGCCATATTTGA), probe (6FAM- TACCACAACCCAGCAGATTTTGTCATGGA-TAMRA), and reverse primer (CCAGCCGACTGTTCTGATCA). Primers and probe for human 18 S RNA were also purchased from Applied Biosystems. Six-week-old male Fischer rats (Taconic) were randomly divided into three groups with 9 animals per group. Animals in the control group were fed a ground-chow diet, and the two treatment groups were fed a ground-chow diet containing 2.8 and 5.6% content of GUGGUL capsules, respectively. At the end of the 10-day treatment, rats were sacrificed and blood samples were collected by heart puncture. Liver and ileum tissues were collected for determination of gene expression by TaqMan. Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined using the kits from WAKO Diagnostics following the manufacturer's instructions. The sample volume used for total cholesterol determination was 20 μl and for triglyceride determination was 60 μl. Lipid concentrations were calculated based on the standard provided with the kits. Both assays were individually performed for the sample from each animal. 0.1–0.2 grams of liver were homogenized in 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), washed with 1 ml of 50 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min. The organic phase was carefully transferred to a new glass tube, washed with 1 ml of 0.36 mCaCl2, methanol (1:1, v/v) twice, then centrifuged at 1500 × g for 10 min. The organic phase was carefully transferred to a new glass tube again, and the volume was brought up to 5 ml with chloroform. To a 1-ml aliquot, 100 μl of 50% Triton X-100 in chloroform was added and the mixture was dried under nitrogen, then dissolved in 200 μl of H2O. The cholesterol determination was performed using the kit from WAKO Diagnostics and expressed as micrograms of cholesterol per milligrams of liver tissue. 80–100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.25 ml of homogenate was transferred to a glass tube containing 0.25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 2.3 ml of 0.85% NaCl. 7 milliliters of methanol were added and mixed, followed by adding 3.5 ml of chloroform. The mixture was cooled for 10 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean glass tube, and 3.5 ml of 0.85% NaCl and 3.5 ml of chloroform were added, followed by mixing and centrifugation as above. The lower phase was recovered and 2 ml of this solution was transferred to a new tube containing 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 in chloroform (w/v). The samples were mixed gently, dried under nitrogen with low heat, and dissolved in 0.25 ml of H2O. The triglyceride determination was performed using the kit from Roche Molecular Diagnostics and expressed as micrograms of triglyceride per milligram of liver tissue. To perform FPLC analysis, the serum sample from each animal in the same treatment group was pooled equally. To a volume of 350 μl of pooled sample, 3.5 μl of 200 mm lipase inhibitor (Sigma) and 8.75 μl of protease mixture inhibitors (Sigma) were added. The mixed sample was then filtered, and a volume of 250 μl was loaded to FPLC (Bio-Rad). Serum lipoproteins were fractionated by the size-exclusion column Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) at a running speed of 0.2 ml/min. Eighty fractions were collected with 0.27 ml per fraction. The cholesterol concentration of each fraction was measured using the kit from WAKO Diagnostics. It has been recently reported that GS (Z or E isomer) is an FXR antagonist that decreases FXR agonist-induced expression of several FXR targets (6Urizar N.L. Liverman A.B. Dodds D.T. Silva F.V.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). BSEP, the major bile acid transporter in the liver, is transcriptionally activated by FXR through an FXR response element in the promoter (21Ananthanarayanan M. Balasubramanian N. Makishima M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Suchy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28857-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We asked whether GS would also decrease FXR agonist-induced BSEP expression. To answer this question, HepG2 cells were treated with Z-GS in the presence of the bile acid agonist ligand CDCA, and BSEP mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR (TaqMan). CDCA alone at 25 μm, a concentration sufficient for half-maximal induction of BSEP expression, induced BSEP expression by 60–80-fold (data not shown). To our surprise, treatment of HepG2 cells with Z-GS did not inhibit but enhanced the CDCA-induced BSEPexpression (Fig. 1 A). This enhancement was in a GS dose-dependent fashion with a maximum of 400–500% that induced by CDCA alone (Fig.1 A). GW4064 is a potent and specific synthetic FXR agonist (30Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M. Chandra G. Plunket K.D. Creech K.L. Moore L.B. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Jones S.A. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 2971-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Similar to CDCA, GW4064 robustly induced BSEP expression in HepG2 cells with an over 100-fold induction at a concentration of 100 nm (data not shown) (22Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As with CDCA, in the presence of 100 nm GW4064, Z-GS also enhanced BSEPexpression in a GS dose-dependent fashion with a maximum of 500% that induced by GW4064 alone (Fig. 1 B). This result indicates that GS can enhance BSEP expression induced by different classes of FXR agonists. In the absence of an FXR agonist ligand, GS treatment alone did not significantly increase BSEP mRNA in HepG2 cells (Fig.1 C). As previously reported, HepG2 cells expressed a low basal level of BSEP with a threshold cycle number ∼40 in TaqMan (22Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Zhao A. Metzger E. Adams A. Meinke P.T. Wright S.D. Cui J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31441-31447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that GS alone did not significantly increase BSEP mRNA or this increase was too small to be detected in this assay. Essentially identical results were obtained with E-GS, but the Z isomer was used for the studies described here. To determine whether the enhancement of endogenousBSEP mRNA by GS is a promoter-dependent event, GS was also evaluated in FXR transactivation usingBSEP promoter-driven luciferase gene expression. In the presence of GW4064, Z-GS enhanced GW4064-induced luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal increase ∼200% that by GW4064 alone (Fig.2 A). The enhancement on BSEP promoter activity was also analyzed at various concentrations of GW4064 with a fixed concentration of Z-GS. As shown in Fig. 2 B, Z-GS at 8 μm enhanced the GW4064-induced luciferase activity throughout the entire titration of GW4064. Taken together, these data indicate that GS enhances FXR-dependent BSEP promoter activation resulting in the enhancement of BSEP mRNA. In FXR transactivation with the BSEP promoter, treatment of HepG2 cells with Z-GS alone (in the absence of an FXR agonist) slightly increased luciferase activities in a dose-dependent fashion with a maximum induction of 4-fold (Fig. 2 C). In the same experiment, GW4064 treatment alone increased luciferase activities by a maximum of 23-fold (Fig. 2 B). The low level of activation onBSEP promoter was mediated through FXR because in this system expression of the luciferase gene required co-transfection of an FXR expression vector. In the absence of exogenous FXR, GS did not increase the luciferase activities (data not shown). GS up-regulation on FXR protein was one of the potential mechanisms to explain the enhanced BSEP expression. To test this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were treated with Z-GS, GW4064, or Z-GS plus GW4064, and FXR protein was detected by Western blot using the antibody against amino acid residues 1–130 of the N terminus of human FXR (31Forman B.M.

This antibody should detect all four FXR isoforms reported by Zhanget al. (32Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that treatment with GW4064 significantly up-regulated FXR protein, consistent with the reported up-regulation of FXR activities by bile acids in vivo (33Xu G. Pan L.X. Li H. Forman B.M. Erickson S.K. Shefer S. Bollineni J. Batta A.K. Christie J. Wang T.H. Michel J. Yang S. Tsai R. Lai L. Shimada K. Tint G.S. Salen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50491-50496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, treatment with GS alone did not significantly change FXR protein levels or the FXR molecular weight, suggesting that GS has no significant effects on FXR protein levels or isoforms. Treatment with GW4064 alone is indistinguishable from the treatment with GW4064 plus Z-GS, further supporting the notion that GS does not alter FXR proteins and isoforms. A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-based FXR coactivator association assay was used to assess FXR agonism/antagonism of GS in the cell-free system. This assay measures ligand-dependent association of FXR with the coactivator SRC-1 (29Cui J. Heard T.S. Yu J. Lo J.L. Huang L. Li Y. Schaeffer J.M. Wright S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25963-25969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous report of GS as an FXR antagonist (6Urizar N.L. Liverman A.B. Dodds D.T.

Lala D.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1590-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), GS alone, either the Z or E isomer failed to activate FXR (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of CDCA, GS decreased CDCA-induced FXR activation with an IC50 of 17 and 15 μm for Z- and E-GS, respectively (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the previous reports, these results confirm that GS is an FXR antagonist"

The central executioner of apoptosis is a family of aspartic acid-specific cysteine proteases known as caspases (3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 4Chang H.Y. Yang X. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 821-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). A major mammalian apoptosis pathway leading to caspase activation is the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway, which is induced by diverse intracellular death stimuli such as developmental cues, cellular stresses, severe DNA damages, and oncogenic transformation (5Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These stimuli lead to the release of several cell death inducers from the mitochondria, including cytochrome c and Smac (also known as DIABLO). Cytochrome c promotes the formation of a cytosolic protein complex that activates an initiator caspase, caspase-9 (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6239) Google Scholar). Smac,1 on the other hand, promotes caspase-9 activation by neutralizing the inhibitory effect on caspases of the X-linkedinhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) (8Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

The IAPs comprise a group of conserved proteins crucial for the regulation of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 10Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). Initially identified as baculoviral proteins that can functionally substitute the baculovirus-encoded caspase inhibitor p35, the IAP family now includes several mammalian cellular proteins (e.g. XIAP/MIHA/h-ILP, cIAP1/HIAP2/hMIHB, cIAP2/HIAP-1/hMIHC, NAIP, ML-IAP, and survivin) and two Drosophila proteins (DIAP1 and DIAP2/dILP). Structurally, all IAPs contain one to three baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs). IAPs can directly inhibit caspases through their BIR domains and intervening linker regions. For example, XIAP has been shown to inhibit caspases-3, -7, and -9 through the BIR region (11Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C.

Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In addition to XIAP, Smac also interacts with cIAP1 and cIAP2 (8Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 9Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Unlike XIAP, the inhibitory effect of the cIAPs on caspases is weak (100–1,000-fold less than that of XIAP) (20Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which cIAP1 and cIAP2 regulate apoptosis remains less understood. Many IAPs, including XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and DIAP1, also contain a COOH-terminal RING domain. The RING domains on XIAP and cIAP1, like those found in many other proteins (21Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), have been shown to possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein polyubiquitination, which typically targets proteins for degradation in the 26 S proteasome, involves the sequential action of three enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3) (24Jackson P.K.

Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity is mainly determined by E3, which binds to both E2 and the substrate and facilitates the assembly of a multiubiquitin chain on the substrate. The E3 activity of XIAP and cIAP1 can mediate their self-degradation during the apoptosis of thymocytes in response to certain apoptosis stimuli. cIAP1 also regulates the level of TRAF2, an intracellular signaling molecule for the tumor necrosis factor receptor 2. The degradation of TRAF2 by cIAP1 appears to sensitize cells to TNF-mediated apoptosis (26Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the RING domain of IAPs has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in a cell type- and/or death stimulus-dependent manner (27Harvey A.J. Soliman H. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K.

The cIAP1 RING domain can mediate the monoubiquitination of caspases-3 and -7 (23Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26661-26664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the XIAP RING domain promotes caspase-3 degradation through polyubiquitination (29Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether the E3 activity of IAPs targets proapoptotic proteins other than caspases. Here we present evidence that cIAP1 and cIAP2 are E3 ubiquitin ligases for Smac and promote the degradation of this critical death inducer. The substrate-dependent E3 activity of cIAPs requires an intact RING finger domain. We also identify putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) for cIAP1 and -2. In addition, DIAP1 is able to ubiquitinate Grim and HID, two Drosophilafunctional homologues of Smac. These results show that cIAPs and DIAP1 can also inhibit apoptosis through the degradation of death inducers. Human embryonic kidney 293T and cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FLAG and hemagglutinin (HA) tags (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and M2 conjugated on agarose beads (Sigma), and yeast ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) GST-UbcH5c, and His6-ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) were purchased from the indicated sources. All mammalian expression constructs were made in pRK5. The cDNAs for cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, caspase-9, and all E2s were of human origin. The cDNA fragments for the full-length E2s were obtained from a lymph node or a leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR. All E2s were tagged with an HA at the NH2 terminus, and the position of the tags for other constructs is indicated in the figures and/or text. The amino acid residues present in the following deletion mutant constructs are indicated in parentheses: cIAP1mut(1–587), cIAP2mut(1–573), cIAP1C(452–618), cIAP2C(441–604), cIAP2ΔBIR1(101–587), and DIAP1mut(1–381). Transient transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Unless indicated otherwise, cells were transfected with 0.1–10 μg of the indicated plasmids to minimize the difference in the expression levels of various proteins. Sixteen to 22 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 beads. The immunoprecipitates and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Mature Smac protein was obtained by the tnt-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLAG-tagged cIAP1, XIAP, and cIAP2mut (which lacked the first BIR domain) were expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody conjugated on agarose beads. For the experiments shown in Fig. 5, A andB, the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) and then added to a ubiquitination reaction mixture containing 120 ng of yeast E1, 2.4 μg of UbcH5c, 4 μg of His6-ubiquitin, and 3 μl of radiolabeled mature Smac in 50 μl total volume. After incubation at 30 °C for 90 min with vigorous shaking, the reaction was terminated by boiling in the Laemmli SDS-loading buffer. Four microliters of the reaction mixture was resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For the experiment in Fig. 5 C, in vitro translated mature Smac was first incubated with the FLAG immunoprecipitating beads at 30 °C for 90 min to allow Smac to bind to the bead-bound E3s. After the ubiquitination reaction, the beads were washed three times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. HeLa cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Grim-HA together with 0.1 μg of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid and 1 μg of DIAP1, DIAP mutant, or control vector. Twenty h after transfection, cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the number of membrane blebbed cells divided by the total number of blue cells, as previously described (30Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30761-30764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The cell death inducer Smac is synthesized as a precursor, which becomes the mature form with the cleavage of its NH2-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence upon entering the mitochondria (8Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, Smac is released into the cytosol, where it becomes associated with IAPs. To examine whether IAPs can target Smac for degradation, we co-expressed in 293T cells the mature Smac protein together with cIAP1, cIAP2, or XIAP. Interestingly, the amount of Smac protein decreased significantly upon co-expression with either cIAP1 or cIAP2 but not with XIAP (Fig.1 A). The down-regulation of the mature Smac protein was unlikely due to the inhibition of apoptosis because XIAP effectively blocked apoptosis (data not shown). In addition, because the expression levels of XIAP were much higher than those of cIAP1 and cIAP2 (Fig. 1 A), the decrease in Smac expression was unlikely caused by the squelching effect of the simultaneous overexpression of multiple proteins. To rule out the possibility that overexpression of cIAPs led to the generalized inhibition of protein expression, we examined the effect of cIAPs on endogenous Smac and found that its expression level was not changed by cIAP overexpression (Fig. 1 B). The cIAP-induced destabilization of Smac and the low expression levels of cIAPs suggest that cIAP1 and cIAP2 might target Smac as well as themselves for degradation via ubiquitination. To compare the self-ubiquitination of the cIAPs with XIAP, we expressed separately FLAG-tagged cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP in 293T cells together with HA-tagged ubiquitin. Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 were modified with multiple ubiquitins, as indicated by the appearance of higher molecular weight products (Fig.2 A, top panel). In contrast, the self-ubiquitination of XIAP was substantially weaker, consistent with its relatively high expression levels (Fig.2 A). To determine whether cIAPs and XIAP can ubiquitinate mature Smac, we expressed cIAPs and XIAP together with mature Smac in 293T cells. The mature Smac protein that bound to cIAP1 and cIAP2 was markedly ubiquitinated, showing a ladder pattern characteristic of mono- and polyubiquitination (Fig. 2 B, top panels). The cIAP1-mediated Smac ubiquitination was so strong that the majority of mature Smac proteins were modified even without the addition of exogenous ubiquitin. The cIAP self-ubiquitination and cIAP-mediated Smac ubiquitination were further confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using an antibody against ubiquitin (Fig. 2 C). XIAP, however, did not induce significant ubiquitination of mature Smac (Fig.2 B). The RING domains of cIAPs are required for their self-ubiquitination (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). To test whether these domains are also needed for the cIAP-mediated ubiquitination of Smac, we deleted the RING domains of cIAP1 and cIAP2. As shown in Fig. 2 D, these RING deletion mutants failed to ubiquitinate mature Smac. Thus, ubiquitination of Smac by IAPs is RING domain-dependent. To examine whether other cellular factors are involved in the cIAP-induced Smac ubiquitination, we expressed cIAPs and mature ΔSmac in HeLa cells. As a positive control, we also expressed them in 293T cells. We found that the binding efficiency of mature Smac to cIAPs in these two different cells was comparable. However, no ubiquitination of mature Smac was observed in HeLa cells whereas the Smac ubiquitination was readily detected in 293T cells (Fig.2 E, top two panels). This result supports the notion that the cIAP-dependent ubiquitination of mature Smac is regulated by other cellular factors. The interactions between IAPs and mature Smac are mediated by the IAP BIR domains and the Smac NH2-terminal region, particularly a 4-amino acid stretch (AVPI). To confirm the specificity of cIAP-dependent ubiquitination of Smac, we generated a mutant cIAP1 construct lacking all the BIR domains and a mutant mature Smac construct with the AVPI motif deleted. The BIR deletion mutant of cIAP1 failed to bind to and degrade Smac (Fig.3 A), even though this region retained E3 activity (22Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). In addition, the AVPI deletion mutant of Smac only weakly associated with cIAPs. This mutant was not ubiquitinated by cIAP1 and showed higher stability in the presence of cIAP1 compared with the wild-type mature Smac (Fig. 3 B). Thus, cIAP-mediated Smac ubiquitination and degradation requires specific interactions between cIAPs and Smac. A eukaryotic genome encodes only one, or at most a few, E1. In contrast, it encodes a dozen or so E2s. To determine which E2s can associate with cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, each IAP was expressed in 293T cells with the E2s that have been previously found to associate with various RING domain E3s. The COOH-terminal region of cIAP2 was used in these experiments because it had higher stability. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that cIAP1 preferentially interacted with UbcH7 and its close homologue UbcH8, as well as with UbcH5C and UbcH5A, whereas cIAP2 associated strongly with all UbcH5 family E2s and weakly with UbcH7, but not with UbcH8 (Fig. 4,A and B). XIAP, on the other hand, associated with all E2s tested but with a weak binding affinity to UbcH5C and UbcH8 (Fig. 4 C). It is common for an E3 to bind to multiple E2s. For example, Parkin, a RING-containing E3 that is associated with Parkinson's disease, interacts with several E2s (31Imai Y. Soda M. Inoue H. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Takahashi R. Cell. 2001; 105: 891-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). E2 recruitment in vivo can also be determined by the presence of other regulatory proteins and the availability of E2s. Because XIAP binds to several E2s, the weak ligase activity of XIAP toward Smac was unlikely caused by a defective E2 binding. In addition, because only the cIAP2 COOH-terminal region that encompasses the RING domain was used for the binding assay (Fig. 4 B), the NH2-terminal BIR domains are dispensable for E2 recruitment. Having identified putative E2s for cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, we next examined the ubiquitination of Smac by these IAPs using anin vitro ubiquitination assay. FLAG-tagged full-length cIAP1 and XIAP and a deletion mutant of cIAP2 lacking the first BIR domain were expressed in mammalian cells and affinity purified with an anti-FLAG antibody. The mutant cIAP2 was used because it was expressed at a higher level than the wild-type proteins yet still retained the capacity to bind to Smac (data not shown). When the purified cIAP1 or cIAP2ΔBIR1 protein was added to a ubiquitination reaction mixture containing recombinant E1 and E2 (UbcH5C) and in vitrotranslated, metabolically labeled mature Smac, ubiquitination of Smac was evident as shown by the appearance of higher molecular weight materials (Fig. 5, A andB, lane 4 versus 1–3). The ubiquitination was significantly enhanced when recombinant ubiquitin was also included in the reaction (lane 5 versus 4). In comparison, XIAP ubiquitinated Smac very weakly even though the amount of XIAP used was much higher than that used with cIAP1 (Fig.5 C, lane 3 versus 2). These results confirm that both cIAP1 and cIAP2 are strong ubiquitin ligases but suggest that XIAP is a weak ubiquitin ligase for mature Smac. Drosophila IAP1 (DIAP1) plays a critical role in apoptosis inhibition. Flies defective with DIAP1 die in the embryonic stage because of excessive cell death (13Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Upon activation of apoptosis, the Drosophila death inducers Grim, HID, and Reaper bind to and eliminate the inhibitory effect of DIAP1 on caspases, via an NH2-terminal motif that is shared with each other and with the mammalian functional homologue Smac (13Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 17Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y.

Several recent studies showed that Hid, Grim, and Reaper promote the autoubiquitination and degradation of DIAP1 (32Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A. Agapite J. Steller H. Meier P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 33Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To determine whether DIAP1, like cIAPs, can mediate the ubiquitination of the death inducers, we examined the effect of DIAP1 on Grim and HID expression levels. Expression of DIAP1 in 293T cells resulted in marked self-ubiquitination, with the appearance of a ladder of higher molecular weight materials typical of ubiquitination. This DIAP1 self-ubiquitination depended on an intact RING domain (Fig.6, A and B,bottom panel, lane 2 versus 3). DIAP1 also ubiquitinated the co-expressed Grim and HID (Fig. 6, A and B, top and middle panels). The expression levels of Grim and HID were increased, rather than decreased, upon the expression of DIAP1 (Fig. 6,A and B, middle panel), consistent with a previous report that the BIR domains of DIAP1 could enhance the stability of Grim/HID likely through a direct protein-protein interaction (36Vucic D. Kaiser W.J. Miller L.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3300-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the levels of Grim and HID were even higher in the presence of the RING deletion mutant of DIAP1, which lost the ability to ubiquitinate itself and Grim/HID (Fig. 6, A andB, lane 3 versus 2). To further confirm that the DIAP1-mediated ubiquitination leads to degradation of Grim, we deleted the only lysine residue in the Grim protein. The resulting Grim mutant could no longer be ubiquitinated by DIAP1, and concurrently the level of Grim protein was markedly increased compared with the wild-type protein (data not shown). Taken together, these results show that the E3 activity of DIAP1 can trigger degradation of both Grim and HID. To address the functional significance of the IAP E3 activity in apoptosis regulation, an attempt was made to compare the apoptosis inhibition ability of the wild-type and the E3-defective cIAP mutants. Paradoxically, overexpression of cIAPs enhanced apoptosis in 293T cells. Although an anti-apoptotic function of cIAPs has been previously demonstrated (37Uren A.G. Pakusch M. Hawkins C.J. Puls K. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4974-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 38Liston P. Roy N. Tamai K. Lefebvre C. Baird S. Cherton-Horvat G. Farahani R. McLean M. Ikeda J.E. MacKenzie A. Korneluk R.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), overexpression of cIAPs in some cells has also been reported to enhance apoptosis, unless the RING domain was deleted (26Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 39Clem R.J. Sheu T.T. Richter B.W. He W.W. Thornberry N.A. Duckett C.S. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This proapoptotic activity of cIAPs could be because of the existence of anti-apoptotic cIAP1 substrates, such as TRAF-2 (26Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. Nature. 2002; 416: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The E3 activity of cIAP thus plays a complex role in the regulation of apoptosis. Overexpression of DIAP1, on the other hand, was not cytotoxic in either 293T or HeLa cells. Rather, DIAP1 potently inhibited Grim-induced apoptosis in these cells in a transient transfection apoptosis assay (Fig. 6 C, top panel, and data not shown). In comparison, the E3 defective RING mutant of DIAP1 was substantially less effective in blocking Grim-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6 C). Therefore, the DIAP1 E3 activity contributes to its apoptosis inhibitory function. The IAPs family is a major group of apoptosis regulators. IAPs have been shown to directly block caspase activity. In this study we found that cIAP1 and cIAP2 can also target the mitochondrial cell death inducer Smac for degradation via the COOH-terminal RING domain-mediated ubiquitination. Similarly, Drosophila DIAP1 possesses E3 activity that can mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of theDrosophila death inducers Grim and HID. These results suggest a novel and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the anti-apoptotic function of IAPs. Among the three mammalian IAPs that interact with Smac, cIAP1 and cIAP2 have strong E3 ligase activity toward Smac. In contrast, the substrate-dependent ligase activity of XIAP is weak, even though it can tightly bind to Smac. A recent report showed that Smac is rapidly degraded upon release from the mitochondria during death receptor-mediated apoptosis and that the Smac degradation is dependent on the proteasome pathway (40MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The authors also detected XIAP-mediated ubiquitination of Smac in vitro. However, by directly comparing cIAPs and XIAP both in vivo and in vitro, we are able to show the marked difference in their E2 activities toward Smac. XIAP has been shown to be a much more potent inhibitor of caspases than cIAPs (20Roy N. Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that cIAPs and XIAP may inhibit apoptosis through different mechanisms. Whereas XIAP may directly bind to and inhibit caspases, cIAP1 and cIAP2 may degrade death inducers such as Smac to prevent it from relieving the inhibitory effect of XIAP on caspases. It has been shown that IAPs bind to Smac through their BIR domains. We have found in this study that cIAPs can also interact with several E2s. Thus, cIAPs may function as single molecule E3s that interact with both the substrate and E2 (Fig.7 A), and these interactions may be regulated by other cellular factors, as suggested by the lack of cIAP-mediated ubiquitination in HeLa cells. In contrast, in the SCF (Skp1, Cullin, F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, the RING-containing E3 (Roc1) associates with the substrate through several intermediary proteins and the substrate specificity is determined mainly by the F-box-containing protein (Fig. 7 B) (24Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 25Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Given that both Smac and Grim/HID interact with the BIR region of IAPs, this region might determine the substrate specificity of the IAPs, and it would be interesting to identify additional IAP substrates that associate with this region. The inhibition of IAPs by the death inducer Smac/Grim/HID and the ubiquitination of death inducers by IAPs indicate that there are dynamic interactions between these two groups of anti- and proapoptotic proteins. These interactions, like those between the anti- and proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family proteins, may greatly influence the lives and deaths of cells.

https://openalex.org/W2018781502,"Estrogen-receptor (ER) status is an important parameter in breast cancer management as ER-positive breast cancers have a better prognosis than ER-negative tumors. This difference comes essentially from the lower aggressiveness and invasiveness of ER-positive tumors. Here, we demonstrate, that interleukin-8 (IL-8) was clearly overexpressed in most ER-negative breast, ovary cell lines and breast tumor samples tested, whereas no significant IL-8 level could be detected in ER-positive breast or ovarian cell lines. We have also cloned human IL-8 from ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, and we show that IL-8 produced by breast cancer cells is identical to monocyte-derived IL-8. Interestingly, the invasion potential of ER-negative breast cancer cells is associated at least in part with expression of IL-8, but not with IL-8 receptor levels. Moreover, IL-8 increases the invasiveness of ER-positive breast cancer cells by two fold, thus confirming the invasion-promoting role of IL-8. On the other hand, exogenous expression of estrogen receptors in ER-negative cells led to a decrease of IL-8 levels. In summary, our data show that IL-8 expression is negatively linked to ER status of breast and ovarian cancer cells. We also support the idea that IL-8 expression is associated with a higher invasiveness potential of cancer cells in vitro, which suggests that IL-8 could be a novel marker of tumor aggressiveness."

We have now tested the roles in that plasticity of two associative cellular mechanisms: activity-dependent enhancement of presynaptic facilitation and postsynaptically induced long-term potentiation. By perturbing molecular signaling pathways in individual neurons, we have provided the most direct evidence to date that each of these mechanisms contributes to behavioral learning. In addition, our results suggest that the two mechanisms are not independent but rather interact through retrograde signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1984101180,"The RON receptor tyrosine kinase is a member of the MET proto-oncogene family that has been implicated in regulating motile-invasive phenotypes in certain types of epithelial cancers. The purpose of this study was to determine if RON expression is altered in primary human colorectal adenocarcinomas. Results from immunohistochemical staining showed that RON is highly expressed in the majority of colorectal adenocarcinomas (29/49 cases). Accumulated RON is also constitutively active with autophosphorylation in tyrosine residues. Moreover, three splicing variants of RON, namely RONdelta165, RONdelta160, and RONdelta155 were detected and cloned from two primary colon cancer samples. These RON variants were generated by deletions in different regions in extracellular domains of the RON beta chain. Functional studies showed that expression of RONdelta160 or RONdelta155 in Martin-Darby canine kidney cells resulted in increased cell dissociation (scatter-like activity). RON variants, RONdelta160 and RONdelta155, also exerted the ability to induce multiple focus formation and sustain anchorage-independent growth of transfected NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, NIH3T3 cells expressing RONdelta160 or RONdelta155 formed tumors in athymic nude mice and colonized in the lungs. These data suggest that RON expression is altered in certain primary colon cancers. Abnormal accumulation of RON variants may play a role in the progression of certain colorectal cancers in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1980925662,"Here we describe a novel mechanism for plasma membrane insertion of the delta opioid receptor (DOR). In small dorsal root ganglion neurons, only low levels of DORs are present on the cell surface, in contrast to high levels of intracellular DORs mainly associated with vesicles containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Activation of surface DORs caused Ca(2+) release from IP(3)-sensitive stores and Ca(2+) entry, resulting in a slow and long-lasting exocytosis, DOR insertion, and CGRP release. In contrast, membrane depolarization or activation of vanilloid and P2Y(1) receptors induced a rapid DOR insertion. Thus, DOR activation induces a Ca(2+)-dependent insertion of DORs that is coupled to a release of excitatory neuropeptides, suggesting that treatment of inflammatory pain should include blockade of DORs."

A complex of apically localized molecules mediates basal localization of cell fate determinants and apicobasal orientation of the mitotic spindle, but how daughter cell size is controlled remains unclear. Here we show that mitotic spindle geometry and unequal daughter cell size are controlled by two parallel pathways (Bazooka/DaPKC and Pins/G alpha i) within the apical complex. While the localized activity of either pathway alone is sufficient to mediate the generation of an asymmetric mitotic spindle and unequal size neuroblast daughters, loss of both pathways results in symmetric divisions. In sensory organ precursors, Bazooka/DaPKC and Pins/G alpha i localize to opposite sides of the cortex and function in opposition to generate a symmetric spindle."
https://openalex.org/W1964130399,"Aberrant CpG methylations play important roles in cancer development and progression. In this study, aberrant methylations in human breast cancer were searched for using methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis (MS-RDA). A CpG island (CGI) in the 5′ region of the heparan sulfate D -glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase-2 (3-OST-2) gene was found to be hypermethylated, while its exon 2 was hypomethylated. In seven breast cancer cell lines, hypermethylation of the 5′ region and loss of 3-OST-2 expression were observed. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, removed the methylation of the CGI in the 5′ region and restored its expression, demonstrating silencing of the 3-OST-2 gene. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis in 85 primary breast cancers showed that the hypermethylation of the CGI in the 5′ region was present in 75 (88%) of them. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT–PCR) analysis in 37 primary breast cancers showed that the average expression level was decreased in them. Further, MSP analysis in primary colon, lung and pancreatic cancers showed that hypermethylation of the CGI in the 5′ region was present in the colon (8/10, 80%), lung (7/10, 70%) and pancreatic (10/10, 100%) cancers. These results showed that silencing of 3-OST-2 was present in a wide range of human cancers. The 3-OST-2 gene encodes an enzyme involved in the final modification step of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), and its silencing is expected to result in abnormal modification of HSPGs and abnormal signal transduction. From the high incidence, silencing of the 3-OST-2 gene is expected to have high diagnostic, and potentially therapeutic, values."
https://openalex.org/W1968428382,"An analytic strategy was followed to identify putative regulatory genes during the development of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This strategy employed a bioinformatics analysis that used a database search to identify genes, which are differentially expressed in human HCC and are also under cell cycle regulation. A novel cell cycle regulated gene (HURP) that is overexpressed in HCC was identified. Full-length cDNAs encoding the human and mouse HURP genes were isolated. They share 72 and 61% identity at the nucleotide level and amino-acid level, respectively. Endogenous levels of HURP mRNA were found to be tightly regulated during cell cycle progression as illustrated by its elevated expression in the G(2)/M phase of synchronized HeLa cells and in regenerating mouse liver after partial hepatectomy. Immunofluorescence studies revealed that hepatoma up-regulated protein (HURP) localizes to the spindle poles during mitosis. Overexpression of HURP in 293T cells resulted in an enhanced cell growth at low serum levels and at polyhema-based, anchorage-independent growth assay. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that HURP is a potential novel cell cycle regulator that may play a role in the carcinogenesis of human cancer cells."

HKB controls polarized cell shape change and apical membrane growth during salivary cell invagination via two downstream target genes, crumbs (crb), a determinant of the apical membrane, and klarsicht (klar), which mediates microtubule-dependent organelle transport. In invaginating salivary cells, crb and klar mediate growth and delivery of apical membrane, respectively, thus regulating the size and shape of the salivary tube."
https://openalex.org/W2094059060,"Sr2+ triggers neurotransmitter release similar to Ca2+, but less efficiently. We now show that in synaptotagmin 1 knockout mice, the fast component of both Ca2+- and Sr2+-induced release is selectively impaired, suggesting that both cations partly act by binding to synaptotagmin 1. Both the C2A and the C2B domain of synaptotagmin 1 bind Ca2+ in phospholipid complexes, but only the C2B domain forms Sr2+/phospholipid complexes; therefore, Sr2+ binding to the C2B domain is sufficient to trigger fast release, although with decreased efficacy. Ca2+ induces binding of the synaptotagmin C2 domains to SNARE proteins, whereas Sr2+ even at high concentrations does not. Thus, triggering of the fast component of release by Sr2+ as a Ca2+ agonist involves the formation of synaptotagmin/phospholipid complexes, but does not require stimulated SNARE binding."
https://openalex.org/W2057926459,"Site-specific electrostatic measurements have been limited to soluble proteins purified for in vitro spectroscopic characterization or proteins of known structure; however, comparable measurements have not been made for functional membrane bound proteins. Here, using an electrochromic fluorophore, we describe a method to monitor localized electric field changes in a voltage-gated potassium channel. By coupling the novel probe Di-1-ANEPIA to cysteines in Shaker and tracking field-induced optical changes, in vivo electrostatic measurements were recorded with submillisecond resolution. This technique reports dynamic changes in the electric field during the gating process and elucidates the electric field profile within Shaker. The extension of this method to other membrane bound proteins, including transporters, will yield insight into the role of electrical forces on protein function."
https://openalex.org/W2034831440,"The E2F-1 transcription factor is a critical downstream target of the tumor suppressor, RB. When activated, E2F-1 induces cell proliferation. In addition, deregulation of E2F-1 constitutes an oncogenic stress that can induce apoptosis. The protein kinase ATM is a pivotal mediator of the response to another type of stress, genotoxic stress. In response to ionizing radiation, ATM activates the tumor suppressor p53, a key player in the control of cell growth and viability. We show here that E2F-1 elevates ATM promoter activity and induces an increase in ATM mRNA and protein levels. This is accompanied by an E2F-induced increase in p53 phosphorylation. Expression of the E7 protein of HPV16, which dissociates RB/E2F complexes, also induces the elevation of ATM levels and p53 phosphorylation, implicating endogenous E2F in these phenomena. These data demonstrate that ATM is transcriptionally regulated by E2F-1 and suggest that ATM serves as a novel, ARF-independent functional link between the RB/E2F pathway and p53."

The 3.0 A resolution crystal structures of the CCA-adding enzyme from Bacillus stearothermophilus and its complexes with ATP or CTP reveal a seahorse-shaped subunit consisting of four domains: head, neck, body, and tail. The head is structurally homologous to the palm domain of DNA polymerase beta but has additional structural features and functions. The neck, body, and tail represent new protein folding motifs. The neck provides a specific template for the incoming ATP or CTP, whereas the body and tail may bind tRNA. Each subunit has one active site capable of switching its base specificity between ATP and CTP, an important component of the CCA-adding mechanism."

After illumination by blue light, recombinant LOV domains of phototropin undergo a transient and fully reversible bleaching of their optical absorption at 400–500 nm accompanied by an increase of absorption at 390 nm (19Salomon M.

This hypothesis could later be confirmed by 13C NMR spectroscopy (22Salomon M. Eisenreich W. Dürr H. Schleicher E. Knieb E. Massey V. Rüdiger W. Müller F. Bacher A. Richter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12357-12361Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of the LOV2 domain of the phytochrome/phototropin chimeric photoreceptor phy3 from the fernAdiantum capillus-veneris was solved at a 2.7 Å resolution (23Crosson S.

Until now, however, the details of the mechanism of adduct formation have not been conclusively established. The ground state, an intermediate state resembling the FMN triplet (3FMN), and the adduct (19Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R.

Bogomolni R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36493-36500Google Scholar) propose an ionic reaction pathway for FMN-C(4a)–thiol adduct formation with the Cys-450 residue initially present as a thiolate, thus requiring a proton donor other than Cys-450 to protonate the light-generated FMN triplet (20Swartz T.E.

Recently, however, it has been shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy that the cysteine residue in LOV2 is protonated in the ground state (25Iwata T. Tokutomi S. Kandori H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11840-11841Google Scholar), implying that an ionic mechanism, which relies on the presence of a thiolate, is flawed. Thus other potential reaction pathways including a concerted mechanism and a radical-pair mechanism have to be considered. We have therefore investigated both the wild-type A. sativaLOV2 domain and a C450A mutant by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The formation of the FMN-thiol adduct is not possible in the C450A mutant due to the absence of a thiol group. In this case, as will be shown, 3FMN undergoes a photoreduction resembling that observed in photolyases (26Heelis P.F. Sancar A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8163-8166Google Scholar, 27Gindt Y.M.

The implications of the observation of FMNH⋅ are discussed in terms of a possible radical-pair mechanism for adduct formation in LOV domains. The characterization of FMNH⋅ by EPR and electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy (29Edmondson D.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 593-600Google Scholar) allowed us to probe the geometrical and electronic structure and the environment of the flavin cofactor in the LOV2 domain using the paramagnetic state as a natural spin label.

The resulting plasmid designated pNCO-HISLOVWT specifies a fusion protein comprising the LOV2 domain of phot1 of A. sativaand hisactophilin from D. discoideum (Fig.2). An expression plasmid specifying the corresponding C450A mutant was obtained by the same approach starting from the plasmid pCAL-LOV2C450A (19Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Google Scholar). The plasmids were electro-transformed into E. coli strain M15[pREP4]. Bacterial cells were grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (180 mg/liter) and kanamycin (15 mg/liter) to an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm. Isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cultures were incubated for 5 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −20 °C. Frozen cell mass (5 g) was thawed in 15 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris hydrochloride, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm CaCl2) supplemented with 20 mg of lysozyme. The suspension was sonicated and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a column of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (column volume, 15 ml; Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl) supplemented with 10 mm imidazole. The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer B and was then developed with a linear gradient of 10–500 mm imidazole in buffer B (total volume, 100 ml). Yellow fluorescent fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration (10-kDa membrane, Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI). The solution was applied to a column of Superdex S75-prep grade (2.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. Yellow fluorescent fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 1 mm as determined photometrically (ε447 = 13,800m−1cm−1 (19Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Google Scholar)). 10 mg of LOV2 C450A hisactophilin fusion protein in buffer B supplemented with 2.5 mm CaCl2 were mixed with 50 units of thrombin (Sigma) and incubated overnight at room temperature. The protein solution was applied to a column of Chelating-Sepharose Fast Flow (column volume, 15 ml) that had been equilibrated with buffer B supplemented with 10 mmimidazole. Cleaved LOV2 C450A protein was collected in the flow-through, whereas hisactophilin protein and uncleaved fusion protein remained bound to the column. Yellow fluorescent fractions were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration through microconcentrators (1-kDa membrane, Pall Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI). Protein homogeneity was monitored by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Protein samples (concentration ∼0.05 mm) were transferred into an optical cuvette (path length, 1 mm; Hellma, Müllheim, Germany) and supplemented with 0.5 mm EDTA depending on the sample and/or deoxygenated and then illuminated for up to 40 min with 420–480-nm light from a filtered Xe lamp (ILC, PS800SW-1) at room temperature. Decay of the radical was measured in a Shimadzu UV-1601PC (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Columbia, MD) spectrophotometer. Samples were transferred into the desired buffer (usually 70 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.0) in H2O or D2O by dilution and ultrafiltration through C10 microconcentrators at 4 °C. The cycle was repeated 5 times to give a final D2O enrichment of 93–97%. The enzyme preparations were transferred into EPR quartz tubes (3-mm inner diameter for X-band (9–10 GHz) EPR; 0.6-mm inner diameter for W-band (95 GHz) EPR) under an argon inert gas atmosphere. They were then illuminated with light of 420–480 nm from a filtered Xe lamp and frozen rapidly in liquid nitrogen. Continuous-wave (cw) EPR spectra at X-band frequencies (9–10 GHz) were obtained using a laboratory-built spectrometer. It consists of a Bruker ER041MR microwave (mw) bridge (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) and an AEG-20 electromagnet. Samples were placed in a Bruker ER4118X-MS-5W1 dielectric resonator, which was immersed in a laboratory-built helium gas flow cryostat controlled by a LakeShore 321 temperature controller. W-band cw-EPR spectra were recorded with a laboratory-built high field EPR spectrometer operating at 94–96 GHz and equipped with a cylindrical TE011 cavity. The six-line EPR signal of a Mn(II)/MgO standard, placed near the sample in the cavity, was recorded simultaneously for g-factor calibration. X-band cw-ENDOR spectra were recorded using a laboratory-built spectrometer consisting of an AEG-20 electromagnet and a Bruker ER041MR mw bridge. A radio frequency synthesizer (Hewlett Packard 8647A) in conjunction with a high power radio frequency amplifier (ENI A-300) was used to generate the cw radio frequency field in the laboratory-built TM110 ENDOR resonator (Q ≈ 1800, 1 turn/mm of NMR coil). The temperature was adjusted using a nitrogen-gas flow controlled by a Bruker ER4111VT temperature controller. To assist in the assignment of experimentally determined hyperfine couplings (hfcs) to individual nuclei in the 7,8- dimethyl isoalloxazine moiety of FMNH⋅, density-functional theory calculations were performed with lumiflavin (7,8,10-trimethyl isoalloxazine) using the program package Gaussian 98 (31). Lumiflavin is considered as a valid model because the ribityl side chain has no significant influence on the electronic structure of FMNH⋅, which is bound in an extended conformation in the LOV domain. The geometry of the FMNH⋅ state was optimized at the unrestricted B3LYP/EPR-II level of theory, and single-point calculations of hfcs and electron densities were performed at the same level. Expression vectors specifying fusion proteins comprising the A. sativa LOV2 domain (amino acid residues 412–516) or its C450A mutant and the actin binding hisactophilin protein from D. discoideum were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” E. colistrains harboring one of these plasmids formed copious amounts of the recombinant fusion protein (about 15% of soluble cell protein), which could be purified easily by affinity chromatography using a nickel-chelate column. The fusion proteins bind tightly to the chelating-Sepharose matrix as a consequence of the abundant histidine residues at the surface of hisactophilin. LOV2 C450A domain, from which the hisactophilin module was cleaved, was prepared with a yield of ∼80% as described under “Experimental Procedures.” LOV2 C450A domain fused with calmodulin-binding protein was expressed and purified according to published procedures (19Salomon M. Christie J.M. Knieb E. Lempert U. Briggs W.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9401-9410Google Scholar). The optical absorption spectra of the LOV2 C450A domains from the samples under investigation before illumination and after irradiation with blue light (420 < λ < 480 nm) are shown in Fig.3. Both fusion proteins have virtually the same ground-state absorbance properties (Fig. 3, B andC, solid lines) as LOV2 protein cleaved from hisactophilin (Fig. 3 A, solid line) but show enhanced stability and solubility. All three proteins have absorption maxima at 363 and 447 nm, characteristic of an FMN chromophore in the oxidized redox state. Shoulders at 425 and 474 nm are vibrational contributions that are well resolved. This is indicative of tight binding between the noncovalently bound FMN and the highly ordered protein structure as well as of the nonpolar nature of the flavin binding pocket. After continuous blue light irradiation all three LOV2 C450A proteins show the formation of a flavin radical characterized by absorption maxima at 570 and 605 nm (Fig. 3, dashed and dotted lines). Radical formation occurs in the absence (Fig. 3,A–C) and in the presence of an exogenous electron donor such as EDTA (Fig. 3 D). Furthermore, the radical formation could be observed either in the presence (Fig. 3, dotted lines) or in the absence (Fig. 3, dashed lines) of oxygen. However, inspection of Fig. 3 clearly shows that the yield of flavin radical differs depending on the protein construct and on the photoreduction conditions. By comparison with the absorption spectra of other flavin radicals in a protein matrix (see, e.g. Ref.27Gindt Y.M. Vollenbroek E. Westphal K. Sackett H. Sancar A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3857-3866Google Scholar), we conclude that in the fusion protein comprising the LOV2 C450A domain and hisactophilin, supplemented with a 10-fold excess of EDTA, the FMN cofactor is fully converted from the oxidized to the one-electron reduced semiquinone form (Fig. 3 D, dashed line). To compare the amount of flavin semiquinone radical formed in the various other samples, we compare their absorbances at 605 nm normalized to the LOV2 C450A hisactophilin fusion protein sample supplemented with EDTA (Fig. 3 D, dotted line). The salient points of these data are that the presence of oxygen reduces the radical yield, whereas the presence of either EDTA or the protein fusion partner hisactophilin enhances the radical yield and reduces the oxygen dependence (see Table II).Table IIDecay of the light-induced flavin radical in various A. sativa LOV2 C450A constructsProtein sampleConditionRadical yieldaTypical error; ±5%./%Radical decaybl/e time constants./minLOV2 C450A-hisactophilinAerobic908 ± 2Anaerobic9243 ± 5Aerobic + EDTA9728 ± 4Anaerobic + EDTA10031 ± 4LOV2 C450A-calmodulin-binding proteinAerobic29NDAnaerobic57NDLOV2 C450AAerobic207 ± 1Anaerobic5678 ± 7Aerobic + EDTAND71 ± 3Anaerobic + EDTAND72 ± 3ND, not determined.a Typical error; ±5%.b l/e time constants. Open table in a new tab ND, not determined. In all samples investigated, the flavin radical is completely reoxidized in the dark to regenerate oxidized FMN on a time scale of minutes depending on the protein construct and buffer conditions (see Table II). We have monitored this process by observing the absorbance changes at 605 nm as a function of time after blue light illumination (see Fig. 4). Under anaerobic conditions (squares) the flavin radical in the cleaved LOV2 C450A domain (Fig. 4 A) slowly decays with a 1/e time constant of (78 ± 7) min, whereas under aerobic conditions (circles) the radical decay is much faster (7 ± 1 min). In the presence of excess EDTA, the decay times in the absence (triangles) or presence (diamonds) of oxygen are virtually identical (see Table II). For the fusion protein comprising the LOV2 C450A domain and hisactophilin, similar trends are observed (Fig. 4 B). Under anaerobic conditions (squares) the flavin radical decays with a 1/e time constant of (43 ± 5) min, which is somewhat shorter than that observed for the cleaved LOV2 C450A domain. Under aerobic conditions (circles) the radical decays with a 1/e time constant of only (8 ± 2) min, which is very close to the value observed for the cleaved LOV2 C450A. In the presence of excess EDTA, the decay times are extended depending on the absence (31 ± 4 min, triangles) or presence (28 ± 4 min,diamonds) of oxygen. To characterize in more detail the light-induced FMN radical in LOV2 C450A domains, EPR experiments were performed with a sample that was frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after blue light irradiation. The X-band cw-EPR signal (Fig.5) reveals a radical signature centered at g = 2.0032 ± 0.0001, which is characteristic for a neutral flavin radical (32Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P.

Möbius K. Weber S. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2002; 106: 8885-8890Google Scholar). Neutral flavin radicals protonated at N(5) can be distinguished from anion flavin radicals by means of their characteristic peak-to-peak EPR line widths of ≈2.0 and ≈1.5 mT, respectively, which is due to the presence or absence of the large hfc of the proton at N(5) (29Edmondson D.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1985; 13: 593-600Google Scholar, 34Edmondson D.E. Tollin G. Top. Curr. Chem. 1983; 108: 109-138Google Scholar). The observed peak-to-peak line width of 2.00 ± 0.01 mT is typical of a neutral flavin radical, FMNH⋅. The overall line width and line shape of the signal is attributed to the mostly unresolved contributions of hfcs of the unpaired electron spin with 1H and 14N nuclei of the isoalloxazine moiety of FMN as well as of the protein environment. To try to detect the EPR signal of a possible second radical species that ought to be created upon electron transfer to FMN in the LOV2 C450A mutant protein, EPR experiments at higher microwave frequencies (95 GHz) and correspondingly larger magnetic fields were also performed (Fig. 6), because overlapping signal contributions from organic radicals are better separated in high magnetic fields due to their differences in g-factor. Even at 95 GHz, only the spectrum arising from one radical species was observed. Scanning over a wider magnetic field range did not reveal any additional signals except for the hyperfine lines of the Mn(II)/MgO standard used for g-factor calibration. The signal shown in Fig. 6 A resembles the frozen-solution spectrum of a neutral flavin radical and is similar to the flavin adenine dinucleotide semiquinone radical observed in DNA photolyase (32Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K. Sadewater P. Sancar A. Bacher A. Möbius K. Richter G. Weber S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16740-16748Google Scholar). From spectral simulation of the rhombic symmetry of the signal, the principal values of the g-matrix, g X = 2.0042 ± 0.0001, g Y = 2.0035 ± 0.0001, andg Z = 2.0020 ± 0.0001 (X,Y, and Z are the principal axes of theg-tensor) may be extracted. Some hyperfine structure emerges in both W-band and X-band EPR spectra (Figs. 5 A and 6 A). Although not fully resolved, a spacing of 1.05 mT (29 ± 3 MHz) between adjacent shoulders in the signals could be determined. After the procedure outlined previously (32Kay C.W.M. Feicht R. Schulz K.

Although there are many modalities of treatment, the recurrence and metastasis rates are high, and the prognosis is unsatisfactory. Gankyrin, a recently found oncoprotein, is a promising target for drug therapy because it is overexpressed in all studied hepatocellular carcinomas. Gankyrin contains six ankyrin repeats and interacts with Rb, Cdk4, and the S6 ATPase of the 26 S proteasome. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screen with gankyrin has identified MAGE-A4 as another interacting protein. The interaction, mediated by the C-terminal half of MAGE-A4, was reproduced in mammalian cells. The interaction was specific to MAGE-A4, because other MAGE family proteins structurally similar to MAGE-A4, i.e. MAGE-A1, MAGE-A2, and MAGE-A12, did not bind to gankyrin. MAGE-A4 partially suppressed both anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor formation in athymic mice of gankyrin-overexpressing cells. The ability of mutant MAGE-A4 to interact with gankyrin correlated with the ability to suppress the anchorage-independent growth. These results demonstrate that MAGE-A4 binds to gankyrin and suppresses its oncogenic activity. So far, the major focus of studies on the MAGE proteins has been on their potential for cancer immunotherapy. Our results may also shed light on novel functions for MAGE-A proteins."

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glucose induces the expression of the hexose transporter (HXT) genes by modulating the activity of the transcription factor Rgt1 that functions as a repressor when glucose is absent. However, in the presence of high concentrations of glucose, Rgt1 is converted from a repressor to an activator and is required for maximal induction of HXT1 gene expression. We report that Rgt1 binds to the HXT1 promoter only in the absence of glucose, suggesting that Rgt1 increases HXT1 gene expression at high levels of glucose by an indirect mechanism. It is likely that Rgt1 stimulates the expression of an activator of theHXT1 gene at high concentrations of glucose. In addition, we demonstrate that Rgt1 becomes hyperphosphorylated in response to high glucose levels and that this phosphorylation event is required for Rgt1 to activate transcription. Furthermore, Rgt1 lacks the glucose-mediated phosphorylation in the snf3 rgt2 andgrr1 mutants, which are defective in glucose induction ofHXT gene expression. In these mutants, Rgt1 behaves as a constitutive repressor independent of the carbon source. We conclude that phosphorylation of Rgt1 in response to glucose is required to abolish the Rgt1-mediated repression of the HXT genes and to convert Rgt1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator.

Glucose not only represses the expression of genes that are required for the metabolism of alternate sugars but also induces the transcription of genes that are essential for its own efficient utilization (1Gancedo J.M.

Among the genes that are induced by glucose are the members of the HXT gene family, which encode glucose transporters. Glucose induces the expression of the HXT1–HXT4 genes by 10–300-fold (4Özcan S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Several components of the glucose induction pathway required forHXT gene expression have been identified, including the glucose sensors Snf3 and Rgt2, that are responsible for sensing extracellular glucose and generating the intracellular signal (6Özcan S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Another component that is absolutely essential for glucose induction of the HXT gene expression is the ubiquitin ligase Grr1 (5Özcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell.

Two homologous proteins, Std1 and Mth1, have been shown to negatively regulate HXT gene expression and to interact with the carboxyl-terminal tails of the Snf3 and Rgt2 sensors (9Schmidt M.C.

Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the absence of glucose, Rgt1 repressesHXT gene expression, whereas at high concentrations of glucose Rgt1 is required for maximal activation of HXT1 gene expression. Repression of transcription by Rgt1 in the absence of glucose requires the general repressor complex, Ssn6 and Tup1. Activation of transcription by Rgt1 in response to high concentrations of glucose requires the glucose sensors Snf3 and Rgt2 and the ubiquitin ligase Grr1 (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).It was previously shown that Rgt1 is required for both repression and activation of HXT1 gene expression and binds to theHXT1 promoter in vitro by gel shift assays (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We report that the requirement of Rgt1 for activation ofHXT1 gene expression in response to high concentrations of glucose is mediated by an indirect mechanism, because Rgt1 is unable to bind to the HXT1 gene promoter in vivo when high levels of glucose are present. Previous data indicated that the transcription of Rgt1 is not regulated by glucose, suggesting the idea that the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 is regulated post-translationally (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Rgt1 is hyperphosphorylated in response to high concentrations of glucose and that the lack of Rgt1 phosphorylation abolishes its ability to activate transcription.DISCUSSIONIt has been previously shown that Rgt1 is the target of the glucose induction pathway that leads to up-regulation of HXTgene expression (5Özcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Rgt1 is a bifunctional transcription factor that is converted from a transcriptional repressor to an activator in response to high concentrations of glucose (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this publication, we have addressed the question of whether glucose regulates the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 by mediating changes in Rgt1 subcellular localization, DNA binding, or post-translational modification. Several transcription factors have been shown to change their subcellular localization in response to external stimuli in yeast, including Mig1 and Pho4 (19DeVit M.J.D. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar,23Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Mig1 is phosphorylated by the Snf1 kinase in the absence of glucose or presence of low levels of glucose and is trapped in the cytoplasm. High concentrations of glucose cause dephosphorylation of Mig1 and translocation into the nucleus (19DeVit M.J.D. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Pho4 is regulated in response to phosphate. At high concentrations of phosphate, Pho4 is phosphorylated and exported into the cytoplasm, whereas starvation for phosphate causes dephosphorylation of Pho4 and translocation into the nucleus (23Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our data obtained using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy suggest that the subcellular localization of Rgt1 does not change in response to glucose.We also tested the possibility that glucose may regulate the DNA binding affinity of Rgt1 utilizing the ChIP assay. As expected we did not see any significant binding of Rgt1 in vivo to theHXT2 and HXT3 promoters in cells grown in presence of high concentrations of glucose. Rgt1 binding to theHXT2 and HXT3 gene promoters was observed only in the absence of glucose, consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor of the HXT2 and HXT3 genes when glucose is absent.Several lines of evidence indicate that Rgt1 regulates both repression and activation of HXT1 gene expression. First, Rgt1 is able to bind to a 280-bp promoter region of the HXT1 genein vitro that is sufficient for glucose induction of this gene (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).2 Second, deletion of RGT1 causes a 10-fold increase in HXT1 expression when glucose is absent but a 5–6-fold decrease in HXT1 gene expression at high concentrations of glucose. Third, a lexA-Rgt1 fusion protein functions as a repressor of transcription in the absence of glucose and as an activator of transcription when glucose is abundant (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Rgt1 might directly regulate HXT1 gene expression in the absence and presence of high concentrations of glucose. However, ChIP analysis of Rgt1 binding in vivoindicates that the positive regulatory effect of Rgt1 onHXT1 gene expression is mediated by an indirect mechanism, because Rgt1 is unable to bind to the HXT1 promoter in response to glucose. It is likely that Rgt1 is required for expression of a transcriptional activator of the HXT1 gene at high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 7).We have consistently observed a change in Rgt1 molecular weight in response to glucose, suggesting that glucose regulates the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 by a post-translational modification event. Treatment of extracts of glucose-grown cells with λ phosphatase indicated that Rgt1 is phosphorylated in response to glucose. Because the molecular mass of the lexA-Rgt1 fusion construct is about 140 kDa, the observed shift in Rgt1 mobility at high concentrations of glucose is likely due to hyperphosphorylation or phosphorylation at multiple sites. The activity of several eukaryotic transcription factors is regulated by reversible phosphorylation in response to changes in the cellular environment. Multisite phosphorylation in particular has been shown to provide a dynamic and precise tuning of the transactivating potential of transcription factors rather than being a static on/off switch. Multisite phosphorylation of transcription factors such as heat shock factor 1 and p53 enables the integration of several different signals (24Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E.F. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Multisite phosphorylation of Rgt1 could have several functions such as the disruption of Rgt1 interaction with a repressor complex in the absence of glucose (Fig. 7) and conversion of Rgt1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator via unmasking of a specific activation domain.Based on several lines of evidence, we propose that Rgt1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the HXT genes in the absence of glucose, in a complex with the Ssn6-Tup1 and Mth1-Std1 repressor proteins (Fig. 7) (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 3J. Lakshmanan, A. L. Mosley, and S.Özcan, submitted for publication. When glucose is abundant, Rgt1 becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociates from the repressor complex. Hyperphosphorylation also converts Rgt1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator (Fig. 7). Consistent with this idea, deletion of the region from amino acids 75 to 395 abolishes the ability of Rgt1 to both activate transcription and become hyperphosphorylated. Furthermore, the grr1 and snf3 rgt2 mutant strains, where Rgt1 functions always as a transcriptional repressor independent of glucose, lack the glucose-induced modification of Rgt1. The presented data also suggest that Rgt1 is not directly involved in the activation of theHXT1 gene expression but rather stimulates the expression of a transcription factor that is required for maximal expression of theHXT1 gene when glucose is abundant (Fig. 7).The region of Rgt1 required for its glucose-mediated phosphorylation (amino acids 75–395) has several potential phosphorylation sites. Our preliminary data indicate that nuclear localization of Rgt1 is required for the glucose-induced modification, suggesting the idea that the kinase(s) that phosphorylate Rgt1 in response to glucose is nuclear. We are currently testing whether any of the known nuclear kinases are involved in phosphorylation of Rgt1.The transcription factor Ume6 belongs to the same family of DNA-binding proteins as Rgt1 and is also a repressor and an activator of gene expression (26Bowdish K.S. Yuan H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2955-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Rubin-Bejerano I. Mandel S. Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell.

Ume6 in a complex with Sin3 and Rpd3 functions as a repressor; however, its interaction with Ime1 during meiosis converts Ume6 to an activator of early genes (29Washburn B.K. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2057-2069291Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The co-repressor Sin3 interacts with the deacetylase Rpd3 and causes repression by deacetylation of histones (30Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Vidal M. Strich R. Esposito R.E. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell.

Interaction of Ume6 with Ime1 is required for the phosphorylation of Ume6 at the amino terminus by the Rim11 and Mck1 kinases (33Xiao Y. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5447-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because Ime1 functions as a transcriptional activator when fused to a DNA-binding domain, it has been proposed that Ime1 provides the activation domain for Ume6 (22Mandel S. Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Like with Ume6, phosphorylation of Rgt1 in response to high concentrations of glucose is important for Rgt1 to function as a transcriptional activator. However, it is not known whether phosphorylation facilitates Rgt1 to interact with an activator like Ime1. It is likely that repression by Rgt1 also involves a co-repressor complex like the Sin3 and Rpd3 that mediates deacetylation of histones. Indeed we have preliminary data indicating that glucose induction ofHXT genes involves changes in histone acetylation levels.2 Experiments are under way to test whether the observed changes in histone acetylation at the HXT gene promoters are mediated by Rgt1. In addition, being an activator itself, Ume6 also induces the expression of another transcription factor, Ndt80, that activates middle genes (25Hepworth S.R. Friesen H. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5750-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to Ume6, Rgt1 is also likely to stimulate the expression of a transcriptional activator that is required for maximal expression of the HXT1 gene in response to high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 7). The yeast Saccharomyes cerevisiae uses glucose as its preferred carbon and energy source. Glucose not only represses the expression of genes that are required for the metabolism of alternate sugars but also induces the transcription of genes that are essential for its own efficient utilization (1Gancedo J.M.

A strain mutated for both sensors (snf3 rgt2 double mutant) is completely defective in glucose induction of the HXT gene expression (7Özcan S. Dover J. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2566-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Another component that is absolutely essential for glucose induction of the HXT gene expression is the ubiquitin ligase Grr1 (5Özcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Li F.N. Johnston M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5629-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Two homologous proteins, Std1 and Mth1, have been shown to negatively regulate HXT gene expression and to interact with the carboxyl-terminal tails of the Snf3 and Rgt2 sensors (9Schmidt M.C. McCartney R.R. Zhang X. Tillman T.S. Solimeo H. Wolfl S. Almonte C. Watkins S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10Schulte F. Wieczorke R.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Repression of HXT gene expression in the absence of glucose is abolished in a std1 mth1 double mutant (9Schmidt M.C.

Jauniaux J.-C. Gancedo J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The target of the glucose induction signal is the Cys6DNA-binding protein Rgt1, which belongs to the family of the Gal4 transcription factors (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the absence of glucose, Rgt1 repressesHXT gene expression, whereas at high concentrations of glucose Rgt1 is required for maximal activation of HXT1 gene expression. Repression of transcription by Rgt1 in the absence of glucose requires the general repressor complex, Ssn6 and Tup1. Activation of transcription by Rgt1 in response to high concentrations of glucose requires the glucose sensors Snf3 and Rgt2 and the ubiquitin ligase Grr1 (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that Rgt1 is required for both repression and activation of HXT1 gene expression and binds to theHXT1 promoter in vitro by gel shift assays (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We report that the requirement of Rgt1 for activation ofHXT1 gene expression in response to high concentrations of glucose is mediated by an indirect mechanism, because Rgt1 is unable to bind to the HXT1 gene promoter in vivo when high levels of glucose are present. Previous data indicated that the transcription of Rgt1 is not regulated by glucose, suggesting the idea that the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 is regulated post-translationally (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Rgt1 is hyperphosphorylated in response to high concentrations of glucose and that the lack of Rgt1 phosphorylation abolishes its ability to activate transcription. DISCUSSIONIt has been previously shown that Rgt1 is the target of the glucose induction pathway that leads to up-regulation of HXTgene expression (5Özcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Rgt1 is a bifunctional transcription factor that is converted from a transcriptional repressor to an activator in response to high concentrations of glucose (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this publication, we have addressed the question of whether glucose regulates the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 by mediating changes in Rgt1 subcellular localization, DNA binding, or post-translational modification. Several transcription factors have been shown to change their subcellular localization in response to external stimuli in yeast, including Mig1 and Pho4 (19DeVit M.J.D. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar,23Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Mig1 is phosphorylated by the Snf1 kinase in the absence of glucose or presence of low levels of glucose and is trapped in the cytoplasm. High concentrations of glucose cause dephosphorylation of Mig1 and translocation into the nucleus (19DeVit M.J.D. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 20Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of Pho4 is regulated in response to phosphate. At high concentrations of phosphate, Pho4 is phosphorylated and exported into the cytoplasm, whereas starvation for phosphate causes dephosphorylation of Pho4 and translocation into the nucleus (23Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1999; 284: 977-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our data obtained using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy suggest that the subcellular localization of Rgt1 does not change in response to glucose.We also tested the possibility that glucose may regulate the DNA binding affinity of Rgt1 utilizing the ChIP assay. As expected we did not see any significant binding of Rgt1 in vivo to theHXT2 and HXT3 promoters in cells grown in presence of high concentrations of glucose. Rgt1 binding to theHXT2 and HXT3 gene promoters was observed only in the absence of glucose, consistent with its role as a transcriptional repressor of the HXT2 and HXT3 genes when glucose is absent.Several lines of evidence indicate that Rgt1 regulates both repression and activation of HXT1 gene expression. First, Rgt1 is able to bind to a 280-bp promoter region of the HXT1 genein vitro that is sufficient for glucose induction of this gene (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).2 Second, deletion of RGT1 causes a 10-fold increase in HXT1 expression when glucose is absent but a 5–6-fold decrease in HXT1 gene expression at high concentrations of glucose. Third, a lexA-Rgt1 fusion protein functions as a repressor of transcription in the absence of glucose and as an activator of transcription when glucose is abundant (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These data suggested that Rgt1 might directly regulate HXT1 gene expression in the absence and presence of high concentrations of glucose. However, ChIP analysis of Rgt1 binding in vivoindicates that the positive regulatory effect of Rgt1 onHXT1 gene expression is mediated by an indirect mechanism, because Rgt1 is unable to bind to the HXT1 promoter in response to glucose. It is likely that Rgt1 is required for expression of a transcriptional activator of the HXT1 gene at high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 7).We have consistently observed a change in Rgt1 molecular weight in response to glucose, suggesting that glucose regulates the transcriptional activity of Rgt1 by a post-translational modification event. Treatment of extracts of glucose-grown cells with λ phosphatase indicated that Rgt1 is phosphorylated in response to glucose. Because the molecular mass of the lexA-Rgt1 fusion construct is about 140 kDa, the observed shift in Rgt1 mobility at high concentrations of glucose is likely due to hyperphosphorylation or phosphorylation at multiple sites. The activity of several eukaryotic transcription factors is regulated by reversible phosphorylation in response to changes in the cellular environment. Multisite phosphorylation in particular has been shown to provide a dynamic and precise tuning of the transactivating potential of transcription factors rather than being a static on/off switch. Multisite phosphorylation of transcription factors such as heat shock factor 1 and p53 enables the integration of several different signals (24Holmberg C.I. Tran S.E.F. Eriksson J.E. Sistonen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 619-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Multisite phosphorylation of Rgt1 could have several functions such as the disruption of Rgt1 interaction with a repressor complex in the absence of glucose (Fig. 7) and conversion of Rgt1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator via unmasking of a specific activation domain.Based on several lines of evidence, we propose that Rgt1 functions as a transcriptional repressor of the HXT genes in the absence of glucose, in a complex with the Ssn6-Tup1 and Mth1-Std1 repressor proteins (Fig. 7) (12Özcan S. Leong T. Johnston M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6419-6426Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 3J. Lakshmanan, A. L. Mosley, and S.Özcan, submitted for publication. When glucose is abundant, Rgt1 becomes hyperphosphorylated and dissociates from the repressor complex. Hyperphosphorylation also converts Rgt1 from a transcriptional repressor to an activator (Fig. 7). Consistent with this idea, deletion of the region from amino acids 75 to 395 abolishes the ability of Rgt1 to both activate transcription and become hyperphosphorylated. Furthermore, the grr1 and snf3 rgt2 mutant strains, where Rgt1 functions always as a transcriptional repressor independent of glucose, lack the glucose-induced modification of Rgt1. The presented data also suggest that Rgt1 is not directly involved in the activation of theHXT1 gene expression but rather stimulates the expression of a transcription factor that is required for maximal expression of theHXT1 gene when glucose is abundant (Fig. 7).The region of Rgt1 required for its glucose-mediated phosphorylation (amino acids 75–395) has several potential phosphorylation sites. Our preliminary data indicate that nuclear localization of Rgt1 is required for the glucose-induced modification, suggesting the idea that the kinase(s) that phosphorylate Rgt1 in response to glucose is nuclear. We are currently testing whether any of the known nuclear kinases are involved in phosphorylation of Rgt1.The transcription factor Ume6 belongs to the same family of DNA-binding proteins as Rgt1 and is also a repressor and an activator of gene expression (26Bowdish K.S. Yuan H.E. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2955-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Rubin-Bejerano I. Mandel S. Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell.

Ume6 in a complex with Sin3 and Rpd3 functions as a repressor; however, its interaction with Ime1 during meiosis converts Ume6 to an activator of early genes (29Washburn B.K. Esposito R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2057-2069291Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The co-repressor Sin3 interacts with the deacetylase Rpd3 and causes repression by deacetylation of histones (30Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Vidal M. Strich R. Esposito R.E. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell.

Interaction of Ume6 with Ime1 is required for the phosphorylation of Ume6 at the amino terminus by the Rim11 and Mck1 kinases (33Xiao Y. Mitchell A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5447-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because Ime1 functions as a transcriptional activator when fused to a DNA-binding domain, it has been proposed that Ime1 provides the activation domain for Ume6 (22Mandel S. Robzyk K. Kassir Y. Dev. Genet. 1994; 15: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Like with Ume6, phosphorylation of Rgt1 in response to high concentrations of glucose is important for Rgt1 to function as a transcriptional activator. However, it is not known whether phosphorylation facilitates Rgt1 to interact with an activator like Ime1. It is likely that repression by Rgt1 also involves a co-repressor complex like the Sin3 and Rpd3 that mediates deacetylation of histones. Indeed we have preliminary data indicating that glucose induction ofHXT genes involves changes in histone acetylation levels.2 Experiments are under way to test whether the observed changes in histone acetylation at the HXT gene promoters are mediated by Rgt1. In addition, being an activator itself, Ume6 also induces the expression of another transcription factor, Ndt80, that activates middle genes (25Hepworth S.R. Friesen H. Segall J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5750-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to Ume6, Rgt1 is also likely to stimulate the expression of a transcriptional activator that is required for maximal expression of the HXT1 gene in response to high concentrations of glucose (Fig. 7). It has been previously shown that Rgt1 is the target of the glucose induction pathway that leads to up-regulation of HXTgene expression (5Özcan S. Johnston M. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2039728034,"Drosophila sensory neurons form distinctive terminal branch patterns in the developing neuropile of the embryonic central nervous system. In this paper we make a genetic analysis of factors regulating arbor position. We show that mediolateral position is determined in a binary fashion by expression (chordotonal neurons) or nonexpression (multidendritic neurons) of the Robo3 receptor for the midline repellent Slit. Robo3 expression is one of a suite of chordotonal neuron properties that depend on expression of the proneural gene atonal. Different features of terminal branches are separately regulated: an arbor can be shifted mediolaterally without affecting its dorsoventral location, and the distinctive remodeling of one arbor continues as normal despite this arbor shifting to an abnormal position in the neuropile."
https://openalex.org/W2059483946,"Cervical carcinomas are most frequently associated with human papillomaviruses (HPV), whose E6 and E7 oncogenes products induce cellular immortalization. The papillomavirus E2 protein is a transcription factor, which represses the expression of the viral oncogenes, and activates viral DNA replication during the vegetative viral cycle. This protein is specifically inactivated in HPV18-associated carcinoma cells, suggesting that E2 functions prevent carcinogenic progression. Indeed, ectopic expression of E2 in cervical carcinoma cells strongly inhibits cell proliferation. Here we show that above a threshold level of expression, the E2 protein induces apoptosis, independently of other viral functions. The amino-terminal domain is responsible for this apoptotic activity, but surprisingly with no involvement of its transcriptional functions. The death pathway triggered by E2 relies on activation of the initiator caspase 8, specific of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. E2 itself is cleaved by caspases during cell death, providing an example of an apoptotic inducer that is itself a target for caspase processing. The autonomous proapoptotic activity of HPV18 E2 described here may counteract the proliferative functions of viral oncogenes, and renders the inactivation of E2 crucial for carcinogenic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2056806457,"Agonist-promoted desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors results in partial uncoupling of receptor from cognate G-protein, a process that provides for rapid adaptation to the signaling environment. This property plays important roles in physiologic and pathologic processes as well as therapeutic efficacy. However, coupling is also influenced by polymorphic variation, but therelative impact of these two mechanisms on signal transduction is not known. To determine this we utilized recombinant cells expressing the human β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) or a gain-of-function polymorphic variant (β1AR-Arg389), and the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) or a loss-of-function polymorphic receptor (β2AR-Ile164). Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined with multiple permutations of the possible states of the receptor: genotype, basal, or agonist stimulated and with or without agonist pre-exposure. For the β1AR, the enhanced function of the Arg389 receptor underwent less agonist-promoted desensitization compared with its allelic counterpart. Indeed, the effect of polymorphic variation on absolute adenylyl cyclase activities was such that desensitized β1AR-Arg389 signaling was equivalent to non-desensitized wild-type β1AR; that is, the genetic component had as much impact as desensitization on receptor coupling. In contrast, the enhanced signaling of wild-type β2AR underwent less desensitization compared with β2AR-Ile164, thus the heterogeneity in absolute signaling was markedly broadened by this polymorphism. Inverse agonist function was not affected by polymorphisms of either subtype. A general model is proposed whereby up to 10 levels of signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors can be present based on the influences of desensitization and genetic variation on coupling.

A general model is proposed whereby up to 10 levels of signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors can be present based on the influences of desensitization and genetic variation on coupling. β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, respectively stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein control conditions desensitized conditions basal state of adenylyl cyclase activation isoproterenol stimulated state of adenylyl cyclase activation analysis of variance Like a number of other G-protein-coupled receptors, the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (β1AR and β2AR,1respectively) undergo desensitization during continuous exposure to agonist. Such desensitization occurs maximally after several minutes of agonist exposure and is due to decreased interaction with Gs, which is evoked by receptor phosphorylation (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar). Thus the signal transduction of these receptors can be characterized as one of two potential conditions or states, defined here as “control” (no recent exposure to agonist) and “desensitized.” However, we have recently shown that an alteration in receptor-Gscoupling can also be imposed by genetic mechanisms. A single nucleotide polymorphism found in the β1AR gene in the human population (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 3Moore J.D. Mason D.A. Green S.A. Hsu J. Liggett S.B. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 271Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) results in either Gly or Arg being encoded at amino acid position 389 of the proximal portion of the cytoplasmic tail. In studies using transfected cells with equivalent expression of the two receptors, the β1AR-Arg389 displays an increase in Gs coupling compared with β1AR-Gly389 (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). So, one can consider that the human β1AR can exist in four agonist-stimulated states: Gly389 control and desensitized, and Arg389 control and desensitized. And, since basal (non-agonist) activity is also affected by these genetic and desensitization processes, eight states can be considered. For the β2AR, a polymorphism that results in a substitution of Ile for Thr at amino acid 164 in the fourth transmembrane-spanning domain results in a decrease in Gs coupling (4Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, eight such states can be considered for the β2ARs as well, again based on genotype and desensitization status. As opposed to their allelic variants, only the β1AR-Gly389and the β2AR-Thr164 (the receptors often designated as “wild-type”) have been studied in regards to desensitization in recombinantly expressing cells (5Freedman N.J.

O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the significant impact that both desensitization and polymorphic variation have on coupling, we considered that control signaling with one variant might even be equivalent to the desensitized signaling of the other. Since inverse agonists act to lower the frequency of spontaneous activation of βARs, there is the potential for coupling polymorphisms to influence this response as well. Knowing the hierarchy of these states facilitates understanding the molecular basis of receptor response to therapeutic agents and receptor dysfunction that can occur in pathologic states, where both genetic and post-translational modifications occur together. Such studies also provide for a general model that depicts the interaction of genetic and desensitization mechanisms in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. To investigate this, we expressed these four receptors in Chinese hamster fibroblasts at equivalent levels and studied the relative effects of these genetic modifications and those of short term agonist-promoted desensitization on receptor function. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type cDNA templates as described previously so as to mimic the human Arg389 β1AR and Ile164 β2AR variants (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 4Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and polymorphic cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pBC12B1. CHW-1102 cells were stably transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Positive clones were selected based on resistance to 300 μg/ml G418. Cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 80 μg/ml G418. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected and maintained as described (7McGraw D.W. Forbes S.L. Kramer L.A. Liggett S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1927-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Confluent layers of CHW cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), and mechanically detached with a rubber policeman in a small volume. The particulates were homogenized with a polytron and then centrifuged at 42,000 × g for 10 min. Pellets were then resuspended in 75 mm Tris, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Expression levels were determined in saturation binding assays. Membranes were incubated with 400 pm125I-cyanopindolol and 100 μm GTP for 2 h at room temperature with nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 1 μm propranolol. Reactions were stopped by dilution and vacuum filtration over Whatmann glass fiber filters. The percentage of the receptor pool that is expressed at the cell surface was determined exactly as described previously (8Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized as above, centrifuged at 400 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant layered over a 35% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 1.5 h. The 0–35% interface (light vesicular membranes) and the pellet (plasma membranes) were collected, diluted in 5 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. Radioligand binding with125I-cyanopindolol was then carried out with each fraction as described above. Confluent monolayers of cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution and allowed to equilibrate in fresh DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then incubated with either a 10 μmconcentration of the indicated agonist with 100 μmascorbic acid or with ascorbic acid alone (control) for 20 min, washed five times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached, and membranes prepared as above. Membranes were incubated with 30 mmTris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mmEDTA, 120 μm ATP, 60 μm GTP, 100 μm cAMP, 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 2.2 μg myokinase, the indicated concentrations of agonist, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The stop buffer contained a [3H]cAMP standard, which accounted for column recovery. [32P]cAMP was separated from [α-32P]ATP chromatographically using alumina columns. Untreated (control) cells bearing the two β1ARs are designated Arg389C and Gly389C, while those studied after treatment with a 10 μm concentration of the agonist epinephrine (desensitized) are designated Arg389D and Gly389D. Similarly, control β2AR are designated Thr164C and Ile164C, while the desensitized state has the subscript “D.” An additional qualifier, based on whether the adenylyl cyclase response is in the absence of agonist (basal, B) or in response to isoproterenol (I), provides for eight different permutations. To ascertain the effects of inverse agonists, COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated receptors and Gαs. At confluence, cells in 24-well plates were washed and incubated with 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine with or without varying concentrations of inverse agonists for 45 min. cAMP produced over this time was quantitated by a competitive immunoassay (AmershamBiosciences). Protein concentrations were determined by the copper bicinchoninic acid method (9Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). Curve fitting was carried out with PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Dose-response curves were compared by ANOVA with post-hoc t tests when thep value was <0.05. Other results were compared with pairedt tests as indicated. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Expression levels of the two β1AR variants in the membrane preparations utilized for the adenylyl cyclase assays were 206 ± 16 for Gly389 and 170 ± 22 fmol/mg for Arg389. Likewise, the two β2AR cell lines had similar levels of expression (Thr164 = 783 ± 88, Ile164 = 1104 ± 111 fmol/mg). Of note, signaling characteristics were compared between the two β1AR variants or between the two β2AR variants, but not between subtypes. There was no evidence for relevant intracellular accumulation of either polymorphic variant as determined by radioligand binding of light vesicular membrane and plasma membrane fractions (Table I). Our initial goal was to assess the degree of agonist-promoted desensitization for the wild-type β1AR (Gly389) and the Arg389polymorphic receptor, and the wild-type β2AR (Thr164) and its variant, Ile164. Concerning the β1ARs, we knew from previous studies that basal and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities (in absolute values) were higher for the Arg389 β1AR compared with the Gly389 receptor. For the current work, cells in culture were exposed to vehicle or agonist for 20 min, washed, membranes prepared, and adenylyl cyclase activities determined. When desensitization is quantitated as the percent decrease of the response relative to that in the absence of agonist pretreatment, the β1AR-Gly389 underwent 21 ± 6.7% agonist-promoted desensitization (Fig.1 a, Table I). No change in the EC50 was observed. The hyperfunctional β1AR-Arg389 underwent a greater degree of desensitization compared with its allelic variant, amounting to 34 ± 4.1% desensitization (p < 0.01 versusβ1AR-Gly389, Fig. 1 b). For the β2ARs, we also found that the two polymorphic variants differed in the extent of agonist-promoted desensitization (Fig. 1,c and d). However, in contrast to what was observed with the β1AR, the hyperfunctional β2AR-Thr164 actually underwent decreased desensitization. β2AR-Thr164 displayed 26 ± 4.0% desensitization versus 37 ± 4.6% found for Ile164-β2AR (p < 0.05).Table IAdenylyl cyclase activation under control and desensitized conditions for the polymorphic β1- and β2-adrenergic receptorsParametersβ1-Gly389β1-Arg389β2-Thr164β2-IIe164Expression, fmol/mg206 ± 16170 ± 22783 ± 881104 ± 11(% cell surface)(80 ± 2.1)(88 ± 3.5)(85 ± 1.7)(83 ± 2.1)Adenylyl cyclase, pmol/min/mgBasalC3.7 ± 0.618.2 ± 1.14.4 ± 0.892.0 ± 0.25BasalD2.5 ± 0.435.5 ± 0.743.8 ± 0.711.9 ± 0.54IsoC15.1 ± 2.221.8 ± 2.817.1 ± 0.458.9 ± 0.45IsoD11.9 ± 2.314.9 ± 2.213.1 ± 0.566.4 ± 1.29pK actpK actC2.28 ± 0.172.34 ± 0.191.38 ± 0.221.48 ± 0.09pK actD2.32 ± 0.232.50 ± 0.191.08 ± 0.141.28 ± 0.20 Open table in a new tab Although the above data examine the extent of desensitization as a percentage of the control response, the absolute levels of adenylyl cyclase activities (pmol/min/mg) establish a hierarchy of signal transduction based on genotype and desensitization. For the β1AR, these data are shown in Fig.2 a. As is seen, the influence of genetic variation was such that even after desensitization, the maximal Arg389 receptor function (ArgDI) was equivalent to the maximal non-desensitized Gly389 variant (GlyCI). The rank order of activities for the various states for the β1AR are: ArgCI > GlyCI = ArgDI > GlyDI > ArgCB > ArgDB > GlyCB ≥ GlyDB. For the β2AR, since the genetically uncoupled Ile164 receptor underwent an even greater degree of desensitization than the wild-type (Fig. 1, c andd), the heterogeneity in adenylyl cyclase activities due to the various permutations was substantial. The eight states are shown in Fig. 2 b. The rank order was thus: Thr164CI > Thr164DI > Ile164CI > Ile164DI > Thr164CB > Thr164DB > Ile164CB = Ile164DB. We also explored whether the polymorphic variations affected the response to inverse agonists. We considered that the conformational effects of these substitutions might constrain the receptor so that it could not be fully “inactivated” (i.e. decreased spontaneous activation) by the binding of inverse agonists. We were unable to obtain consistent results in CHW cells, likely due to the low levels of basal adenylyl cyclase activity and the relatively low expression levels in the stable lines. Thus COS-7 cells were transfected with the various receptors along with Gαs, exposed to the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine, and whole cell cAMP production over the ensuing 30 min determined in the absence or presence of various concentrations of the inverse agonists CGP-20712 (β1AR) or ICI-118551 (β2AR). Here, it is the absolute levels of cAMP that are relevant rather than a percent change. Results are shown in Fig.3. The basal levels of cAMP were greater for β2AR Thr164 compared with β2AR Ile164, as might have been predicted from the membrane studies. Interestingly, a similar difference between the two β1ARs, which also might be expected, was not observed. This may be because spontaneous (i.e. non-agonist) activation is less apparent with β1AR (10Engelhardt S. Grimmer Y. Fan G.H. Lohse M.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 629-631PubMed Google Scholar), and thus, differences in the two variants may not be as readily discerned. Regarding the responses to inverse agonists for the β1ARs, exposure to CGP-20712 resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cAMP production for both receptors. The response was identical for both, with minimal cAMP levels of 7.1 ± 0.8 and 7.0 ± 0.9 pmol/mg for Arg389 and Gly389 (n = 5). Similarly, for the β2ARs the inverse agonist ICI-118551 lowered cAMP to the same levels for both receptors (Thr164= 7.4 ± 0.1, Ile164 = 6.5 ± 1.0 pmol/mg,n = 4). These results indicate that the responses to inverse agonists are not influenced by these genetic variations. The dynamic nature of signaling by G-protein-coupled receptors has been considered indicative of the ability of these receptors to rapidly adapt to changes in their signaling environment. Processes such as receptor desensitization are critical for maintenance of homeostasis during normal physiological circumstances, may be compensatory in certain pathological states, or may aberrantly alter signaling and contribute to characteristics of disease states (11Bunemann M. Lee K.B. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Roseberry A.G. Hosey M.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1999; 61: 169-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Desensitization may also limit the effectiveness of therapeutically administered agonists (tachyphylaxis). Using recombinantly expressed receptors, the nature of rapid agonist-promoted desensitization of many G-protein-coupled receptors has been explored. Some receptors, such as the α2CAR and the β3AR, display little or no rapid desensitization (12Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Liggett S.B. Freedman N.J. Schwinn D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Others display a range of desensitization attributed to various mechanisms including phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, or second messenger-dependent kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. Such comparative studies can be helpful in drug design or understanding selected features of disease states. With the recent elucidation of polymorphic variants of receptors such as the β1- and β2AR, which have significant functional impact on receptor coupling, the potential interaction between desensitization and genetic variation needs to be considered so as to establish how receptor signaling is influenced by both processes. Here we have carried out studies with polymorphic β1ARs (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), which have either Gly or Arg at amino acid 389. This residue is located in the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, within a predicted α helix formed between the seventh transmembrane-spanning domain and the membrane-anchoring palmitoylated cysteine(s) (14Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Given the steric properties of Gly within α helices, and the importance of this region for G-protein binding, it is not surprising that functional coupling is different between the Arg and Gly β1AR variants. The β2AR polymorphism (4Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consists of a substitution of Ile for Thr in the fourth transmembrane-spanning domain, and also displays altered coupling to Gs, likely due to changes in the agonist binding pocket that affects the conformation of the intracellular loops. A priori, it was not clear whether these polymorphisms would enhance or depress agonist promoted desensitization. For example, the robust signaling of β1AR-Arg389 might render it less likely to desensitize; conversely, since its conformation is more favorable for Gs coupling, it could be more sensitive to G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-mediated phosphorylation, which is dependent on the receptor being in the active conformation. We show here that there is a significant impact of these polymorphisms on agonist-promoted desensitization. In the case of β1AR function, the desensitized hyperfunctional variant (Arg389) is equivalent to that of the non-desensitized Gly389receptor. Since the basal level of signaling, which represents spontaneous conversion to R*, is also relevant, the number of permutations, taking into account basal or agonist stimulation, non-desensitized or desensitized, and two polymorphic variants, for the β1AR amounts to eight. For the β1AR this is graphically displayed in matrix format with the aforementioned states in Fig. 4, which is useful for considering a more generalized scheme of the role of genetic variation in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling (see below). As is shown, there is considerable variation in basal and agonist-stimulated activities upon stratification by genotype and desensitization status. Such a range of relative signaling efficacy, and the complex interactions between desensitization and genotype, may explain the high degree of interindividual variability in physiologic responses to agonists and antagonists that has been observed (reviewed in Ref. 15Liggett S.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). An additional level of signaling can also be found when one considers the response to inverse agonists, which bind receptor and tend to stabilize the R state, and thus minimize spontaneous conversion to R*. As such, Gs-coupled receptors display a decrease in basal adenylyl cyclase activity/cAMP production. Depending on the nature of the polymorphism, the response to inverse agonist could also be affected by genetic variation. Interestingly, despite the other effects of these polymorphisms, differences in inverse agonist efficacy were not observed with either the β1AR or β2AR variants, as cAMP levels were reduced by inverse agonists to the same absolute levels regardless of genotype. (These values are not incorporated into Fig. 4, since they were determined using a different approach and are not directly comparable.) For a general model (Fig. 5) of the potential interaction of uncoupling events due to genetic variation and to desensitization, we have made several assumptions to include polymorphisms with various phenotypic effects on receptor signaling. From prior characterization of agonist, receptor, and G-protein interactions of the polymorphic βAR (2Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 4Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have assumed that the conformation of the receptor is altered by the polymorphisms under study, thus the depiction of two active conformations (RI*1, RII*3) based on the two different receptors (RI and RII). It is also assumed that when desensitized the conformation of the receptor is altered by phosphorylation and β-arrestin interaction (16Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar), and these states are thus denoted as RI*2 and RII*4. The “basal” (i.e.non-agonist bound) signaling of a receptor, due to spontaneous toggling to an active conformation, is also considered here as relevant, as is the effect of desensitization on basal signaling. (Although not affected with the β1AR or β2AR, the potential for a coupling polymorphism to alter inverse agonist activity is included in the general model.) The abundance of each of the above species at equilibrium is indicated by the arrows and the subscripted brackets. Within this general model 10 relevant levels of signaling, due to the various states or abundance of a given species, are present at steady state. Of note, other minor species of unknown signaling significance, such as agonist-bound receptor that is not activated (i.e. ARI), are not included. From the standpoint of βAR subtypes in the heart, their functional regulation has been linked to a variety of physiological states in diseases such as heart failure. In human heart failure, myocardial β1AR and β2AR have been shown to be desensitized. Along with receptor down-regulation, this response is thought to be adaptive in that the pathologically altered heart with limited physiologic and metabolic reserves is protected from constant stimulation by high circulating catecholamines. On the other hand, other studies in genetically altered mice have suggested that some aspects of desensitization of βAR signaling may be maladaptive in experimental heart failure (17Liggett S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 947-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that β1AR or β2AR polymorphisms are associated with certain physiologic or pathologic phenotypes in human heart failure (18Liggett S.B. Wagoner L.E. Craft L.L. Hornung R.W.

Med. 2002; 347: 1135-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). However, prior to the current study it has not been clear whether there was any potentiation, or attenuation, of desensitization events by these polymorphisms. The in vitrodata presented here indicate that both desensitization and genetic variation together can serve to set the ultimate level of signaling of β1AR and β2AR. Indeed, the signaling of some receptors, even in the desensitized state, is equivalent to their non-desensitized allelic variants. Stated another way, genetic variation can have an effect of the same magnitude as that of desensitization. Regarding βAR in heart failure, this may be particularly important in defining patient subsets, tailoring therapeutic regiments, or in the development of new agents (15Liggett S.B. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Liggett S.B. Pharmacology. 2000; 61: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). As a general paradigm, we present a model by which genetic variation and desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling can be considered as multiple states. Although the prevalence of functional polymorphisms within the superfamily is not fully defined (23Small K.M. Seman C.A. Castator A. Brown K.M. Liggett S.B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), many G-protein-coupled receptors have been reported to be polymorphic in their coding regions (24Rana B.K. Shiina T. Insel P.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 593-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Small K.M. Tanguay D.A. Nandabalan K. Zhan P. Stephens J.C. Liggett S.B. Am. J. Pharmacogenomics. 2003; 3: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), such that the model may be applicable to multiple diverse signaling events by these receptors.

https://openalex.org/W1965667519,"An apoptotic signal triggered by cell surface death receptors is disseminated to intracellular compartments through protein–protein interactions mediated by conserved domains such as the death effector domain (DED). A unique family of single DED-containing proteins, including DEDD and DEDD2, is targeted to the nucleolus. However, the role of DEDD/DEDD2 in apoptosis remains less understood. Here we show that DEDD and DEDD2 are highly conserved in diverse species, and that they are potent inducers of apoptosis in various cell types. Deletion analysis indicates that both the N-terminal DED domain and the C-terminal region of DEDD2 can induce apoptosis. The cell death activity of this family appears to be related to their nuclear localization. DEDD and DEDD2 bind to two tandem DED-containing caspases, caspase -8 and -10, that are engaged by death receptors. Consistent with the nuclear localization of this family, caspase-8 translocates to the nucleus during CD95-induced apoptosis. DEDD and DEDD2 also readily associate with themselves and with each other. These results suggest that DEDD and DEDD2 may be important mediators for death receptors and that they may target caspases to the nucleus."

MAT1 is an assembly/targeting factor for cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase (CAK), which has been shown to functionally interact with general transcriptional factor TFIIH, a known inducer of ER transactivation. We show that estrogen signaling promotes nuclear translocation of MAT1 and that MTA1 interacts with MAT1 both in vitro and in vivo. MAT1 binds to the C-terminal 389–441 amino acids GATA domain and N-terminal 1–164 amino acids bromo-domain of MTA1, whereas MTA1 binds to the N-terminal ring finger domain of the MAT1. In addition, MAT1 interacts with the activation function 2 domain of ER and colocalizes with ER in activated cells. MTA1 deregulation in breast cancer cells led to its interactions with the CAK complex components, ER, and HDAC2. Accordingly, MTA1 inhibited CAK stimulation of ER transactivation that was partially relieved by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, suggesting that MTA1 might inhibit CAK-induced transactivation function of ER by recruiting HDAC. Furthermore, MTA1 overexpression inhibited the ability of CAK complex to phosphorylate ER. Together, these findings identified MAT1 as a target of MTA1 and provided new evidence to suggest that the transactivation functions of ER might be influenced by the regulatory interactions between CAK and MTA1 in breast cancer cells.

Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Google Scholar,2Owen-Hughes T. Workman J.L. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1994; 4: 403-441Google Scholar). Formation of nucleosomes and higher order chromatin structures can render the DNA inaccessible to transcription factors and complexes. For transcription factors to access DNA, the repressive chromatin structure needs to be remodeled. Dynamic alterations in the chromatin structure can facilitate or suppress the access of the transcription factors to nucleosomal DNA, leading to transcriptional regulation. One way to achieve this is through alterations in chromatin remodeling factors or in the acetylation state of nucleosomal histones (3Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Google Scholar, 4Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Google Scholar, 5Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Google Scholar). Acetylation of core histones occurs at lysine residues on the N-terminal tails of the histones, thus neutralizing the positive charge of the histone tails and decreasing their affinity for DNA. Hyperacetylated chromatin is generally associated with transcription activation, whereas hypoacetylated chromatin is associated with transcription repression (3Owen-Hughes T. Utley R.T. Cote J. Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Science. 1996; 273: 513-516Google Scholar, 4Paranjape S.M. Kamakaka R.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 265-297Google Scholar, 5Brownell J.E. Zhou J.

A number of recent studies have raised the possibility of a close connection between HDACs1 and cancer. Because HDAC-mediated deacetylation of nucleosomal histones is known to be associated with transcriptional repression of some genes, it is being proposed that the deregulation of recruitment of HDAC-containing repressor complex to specific target promoters could serve as a potential mechanism by which these enzymes contribute to tumorigenesis. For example, MTA1 (metastasis-associated protein1) represses estrogen receptor-α (ER)-driven transcription by recruiting HDAC to the ER response element (ERE)-containing target gene chromatin in breast cancer cells (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar). The NuRD-70 polypeptide of nucleosome remodeling/HDAC complex is identical to that of the MTA1 (8Hassig C.A. Fleischer T.C. Billin A.N. Schreiber S.L. Ayer D.E. Cell. 1997; 89: 341-347Google Scholar, 9Laherty C.D. Yang W.-M. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Google Scholar, 10Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J.

The MTA1 gene was initially identified by differential expression in rat mammary adenocarcinoma metastatic cells, and its expression has been shown to correlate well with the metastatic potential of several human cell lines and tumors (12Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Google Scholar). To better understand the cellular functions of MTA1 in breast cancer cells, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to clone MTA1-interacting proteins. One of several isolates was identified as MAT1 (ménage átrois1). MAT1 was originally discovered as an integral component of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK7)-activating kinase (CAK), a complex consisting of catalytic subunit CDK7, regulatory subunit cyclin H, and MAT1 (13Tassan J.P. Jaquenoud M. Fry A.M. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Google Scholar). The MAT1 protein consists of three major motifs: the N-terminal RING finger region, the central coiled-coil region, and the C-terminal cyclin-like region (13Tassan J.P. Jaquenoud M. Fry A.M. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Google Scholar, 14Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Google Scholar, 15Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin.

The functions of MAT1 are mediated by interactions of these motifs with distinct protein-protein interactions. For example, the RING finger domain is linked with general transcription factor TFIIH-mediated transcription (17Busso D. Keriel A. Sandrock B. Poterszman A. Gileadi O. Egly J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22815-22823Google Scholar), the coiled-coil domain in making contact with TFIIH via XPB and XPD helicase subunits (18Reardon J.T. Ge H. Gibbs E. Sancar A. Hurwitz J. Pan Z.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6482-6487Google Scholar), and the cyclin-like region in the formation of trimeric CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex (19Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquest D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Google Scholar). MAT1 facilitates the formation of the ternary CAK complex by assembling and stabilizing the interactions between the CDK7 and cyclin H without involving the activating phosphorylation in the T-loop of human CDK7 (20Larochelle S. Chen J. Knights R. Pandur J. Morcillo P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Suter B. Fisher R.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3749-3759Google Scholar). MAT1 has been also shown to determine the substrate specificity of CAK, because recruitment of MAT1 to the CDK7/cyclin H as a part of TFIIH preferentially targets the RNA polymerase II large subunit over CDK2 (21Rossignol M. Kolb-Cheynel I. Egly J.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1628-1637Google Scholar). In addition, MAT1 as a part of CDK7-cyclin H-MAT1 complex within the context of TFIIH enhances the phosphorylation of several in vitro substrates, including the POU domain of octamer transcription factor (22Inamoto S. Segil N. Pan Z.Q. Kimura M. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29852-29858Google Scholar), tumor suppressor p53, and pRB proteins (23Ko L.J. Shieh S.Y. Chen X. Jayaraman L. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7220-7229Google Scholar, 24Wu L. Chen P. Shum C.H. Chen C. Barsky L.W. Weinberg K.I. Jong A. Triche T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 260-270Google Scholar), retinoic acid receptor-α (25Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Google Scholar, 26Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Google Scholar), and estrogen receptor-α (27Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.-M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Google Scholar). In addition, MAT1 also binds to XPB and XPD helicases subunits of TFIIH that recruit CAK complex to the core TFIIH (27Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.-M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Google Scholar). These observations suggest that MAT1 as a part of CAK in conjunction with multi-enzymatic protein complex TFIIH participates in several fundamental aspects of the transcription regulation. Because RING finger and coiled-coil motifs are generally involved in protein-protein interactions, MAT1 could potentially interact with other cellular regulatory proteins. Here, we show that MTA1 directly binds to the MAT1 and represses CAK-mediated stimulation of ERE transcription and that MAT1 interacts with ER in a ligand-independent manner. In addition, MAT1 is frequently up-regulated in human breast tumors. These findings reveal a novel connection among MTA1, MAT1, and cancer and discovered the existence of regulatory interactions between MTA1 and CAK in breast cancer cells. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, T47-D, MDA-MB-453, BT-474, and ZR-75 human breast cancer cells (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat.

Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The following antibodies were used: anti-MAT1, anti-MTA1, anti-cyclin H, anti-CDK7, and anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-T7 (Novagen, Milwaukee, WI), anti-HER-2 (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), anti-vinculin (Sigma), anti-ER (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Alexa 546-labeled goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies and the DNA-intercalating fluorescent dye ToPro3 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The full-length MTA1 (1–715 amino acids) (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar) was digested withBamHI and XbaI (blunt end) and ligated to the pGBKT7 vector that expresses protein fused to amino acids 1–147 of the GAL4-DNA binding domain at BamHI and PstI (blunt end) (Clontech). MTA1 baits were constructed by deleting 1–254 amino acids from the N terminus of MTA1 by cutting and self-ligating with NcoI. The remaining 255–715 amino acids of the C terminus of MTA1 was used as bait. This bait was used to screen a human mammary gland cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2 × 106clones were screened. The positive clones were isolated and sequenced at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Core sequencing facility. The positive clones were also verified by one-on-one transformations and selection on agar plates lacking adenine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and also by β-galactosidase assay (28Kumar R. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar). Nine MTA1 deletion constructs were generated to map the binding site(s) of MTA1 with MAT1 by PCR-based procedure. Starting from the N-terminal region, the constructs were named N1-MTA1 to N9-MTA1. All of the forward (F) primers including the ATG start codon primer contain anEcoRI site and all of the reverse (R) primers including the stop codon (TAG) primer contain a SalI site. The ATG start codon primer is 5′-GCCGCCGGAATTCACATGGCCGCCAACA-3′and the stop codon (TAG) primer was 5′-AGGTGGGGGTCGACCCTAGTCCTCCCG-3′. The construction of N1-MTA1 through N7-MTA1 used the ATG start codon primer plus N1R, 5′-ACTCGAATGTCGACTTTATCTGCCA-3′; n2r, 5′-AGCTGCTGCAGTCGACGGCCCGTGCGA-3′; N3R, 5′-AGGCCCGGCCGTCGACAGGGCTCTGGCCCGG-3′; N4R, 5′-ACTGCGGTGTCGACCTGGCCTCTCTCCA-3′; N5R, 5′-ACCGAAGCACGTCGACCAGCGGCTT-3′; and N6R, 5′-TCAGGCGCACGTCGACGGGGTAGGACT-3′, respectively. The N7-MTA1 was constructed by using N7F, 5′-accttcggaattcccctggactgca-3′, and N3R primers. For the construction of N8-MTA1 (422–715 amino acids) and N9-MTA1 (542–715 amino acids), we used stop codon primer and N8F, 5′-TGATGGAGGAATTCCAGGACCAAAC-3′, and N9F, 5′-GAAGCCGTGCGAATTCATCTTGAGA-3′, respectively. All of the PCR products were run into 0.8% agarose gel, purified by Geneclean or Mermaid (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA), cut with EcoR1 plus SalI, and ligated to pGEX-5X vector at EcoR1 and XhoI site. After confirming the sequences, these constructs were cut atEcoRI and NotI site and ligated with pcDNA3.1A vector at EcoR1 and NotI site for the T7 tag protein (29Li F. Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. Zhou H. Sen S. Chernoff J. Mandal M. Kumar R. EMBO Reports. 2002; 3: 767-773Google Scholar). The sequence of N10-MTA1 deletion construct (amino acids 212–715) has been described previously (28Kumar R. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar). A similar PCR-based procedure was used to generate eight deletion constructs of MAT1. Four of five deletion constructs were made for MAT1 using either start codon primer 5′-GGGAATTCCCATGGACGATCAGGGT-3′ or stop codon primer 5′-CTTATGTCGACTTAA CTGGGCTGCCA-3′. The following constructs were made by PCR with start codon primer plus 189R (1–189 amino acids), 5′-GCAGAGCAACAGCGGCCGCAGAAC TCTCCAGCTCAT-3′; 114R (1–114 amino acids), 5′-TCTTTTTGGTGGCGGCCGCATCCACATTGTTG-3′; 66R (1–66 amino acids), 5′-CAACCTCCTTGGCGGCCGCGGGATCTTCAAAGA-3′; and using stop codon primer plus 189F (189–309 amino acids), 5′-GATGAGCTGGGAATTCCTGATCTCCCTGTTGCT-3′. The amino acids 114–189 construct was made using the primers 114F, 5′-ACTTGACCAACAGAATTCATTTGGACAACACCA-3′, and 189R. After Geneclean, the PCR products were digested with either EcoR1 andSalI or EcoR1 and NotI and ligated to a pcDNA 3.1A vector at either EcoRI and XhoI or EcoRI and NotI. Transfection was performed with a FuGENE 6 kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO5, 1× protease mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on ice for 15 min. Cell lysates containing equal protein were immunoprecipitated with the desired antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (28Kumar R. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar, 29Li F. Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. Zhou H. Sen S. Chernoff J. Mandal M. Kumar R. EMBO Reports. 2002; 3: 767-773Google Scholar). The effect of MTA1 on CAK phosphorylation of ER was determined according to Chen et al. (27Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.-M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells stably expressing either pcDNA or T7-MTA1 were transfected with CDK7 and MAT1 and labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-ER antibody, and the status of phosphorylated ER was analyzed by autoradiography. Approximately 106 cells were treated with cross-linked histones to DNA. The ChIP assay was performed as described (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with corresponding antibodies, the eluted DNA was amplified by PCR using the primers GAATTAGCTTAGGCCTAGACGGAATG (forward) and AGGATTTGCTGATAGACAGAGACGAC (reverse) for pS2 promoter around the ERE site. Mouse tissue samples were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen as described previously (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar, 30Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Google Scholar). Human breast tissue samples were obtained from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Breast Tumor Core Pathology Laboratory maintained by Aysegul A. Sahin (31Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.W. Mazumdar A. Kim Y.S. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Google Scholar, 32Barnes C.J. Li F. Mandal M. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1251-1255Google Scholar). Thawed tissue samples were homogenized in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate (v/w), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mmNaVO5, and protease inhibitor mixture), and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blotting. The protein vinculin was used routinely as a loading control. In vitro transcription and translation of the test proteins were performed by using the TNT transcription-translation system (Promega). One microgram of desired DNA in pCDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen) was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine in a reaction volume of 50 μl by using the T7-TNT reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and an aliquot (250 μl) was used for each GST pull-down assay. Two μl of the translated reaction mixture was verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The GST pull-down assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of GST or GST fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) within vitro translated 35S-labeled test protein. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and washed six times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography (32Barnes C.J. Li F. Mandal M. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1251-1255Google Scholar). The cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well culture plates. When the cells were ∼50% confluent, they were serum-starved for 36 h. Alternatively, 30% confluent cells were maintained in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-striped fetal calf serum for 72 h and treated with β-estradiol (10−9m) for 30 min with or without pretreatment with the anti-estrogen ICI 182780 (10−8m) for 1 h. The cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in cold 100% methanol for 10 min, and processed for immunofluorescent localization of MAT1 and Myc-tagged MTA1 or ER. The DNA was visualized by counterstaining with ToPro3. Fluorescent labeling was visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope and a 40× objective (32Barnes C.J. Li F. Mandal M. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1251-1255Google Scholar). For immunohistochemical detection of MAT1, the sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated using graded ethanol (30Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5437-5447Google Scholar). The sections were incubated in 0.3% H2O2 and methanol for 30 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase. The sections were then boiled for 10 min in 0.01m citrate buffer and cooled for 30 min at room temperature to expose antigenic epitopes. The sections were sequentially biotin- and protein-blocked and incubated with primary antibody overnight at room temperature followed by biotinylated secondary antibody, streptavidin-biotin complex, amplification reagent, and streptavidin-peroxidase complex (DAKO Corporation, Carpinteria, CA), and then developed with DAB-H2O2 and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Anti-MAT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used at a dilution of 1:100. Statistical analysis was done using Student's t test. The values are considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. To better understand the functions of MTA1 in breast tumor cells, a yeast two-hybrid screening of the mammary gland cDNA expression library was performed using the MTA1 C-terminal amino acids 255–715 as bait. This bait contains several binding motifs (DNA-binding domain, GATA domain, and SH2 and SH3 binding domains). As a negative control, we used a recently identified MTA1s variant that lacks protein-binding motifs as bait (28Kumar R. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Google Scholar). Yeast cells expressing the Gal4 fusion protein were transformed with the above bait. Screening of 2 × 106 transformants resulted in the isolation of several positive clones. By sequencing of the positive clones, we identified several clones that encoded cDNA of MAT1 (GenBankTMaccession number X92669), an integral component of the CAK complex (33Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Google Scholar). The specificity of the MTA1-MAT1 interactions was verified by one-on-one transformation (Fig.1 A). Interaction was further confirmed by the growth of the transformed colonies in medium lacking adenosine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine and development of blue coloration in β-galactosidase assay, whereas the cotransfection with the control GBK vector did not do so (Fig. 1 A). Subsequent studies were undertaken to understand the significance of MTA1 interactions with MAT1 in breast cancer cells. To confirm the interaction between MAT1 and MTA1, we next examined the ability of in vitro translated MAT1 protein to bind with GST-MTA1 in vitro. MAT1 interacted efficiently with GST-MTA1 but not with GST alone in GST pull-down assays (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Conversely, in vitro translated MTA1 protein also specifically interacted with GST-MAT1 (Fig. 1 B,right panel). To confirm the MAT1 interaction with MTA1 in vivo, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with the equal amounts of c-Myc-tagged MTA1 and T7-tagged MAT1. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with an anti-T7 antibody was followed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc antibody. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, cotransfection with T7-MTA1 but not pCDNA coimmunoprecipitated c-Myc-MTA1. To further demonstrate the existence of the noticed interaction between MAT1 and MTA1 in vivo, we used MCF-7 breast cancer cells stably expressing T7-tagged MTA1 or pCDNA (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of the endogenous MAT1 with an anti-MAT1 monoclonal antibody was followed by immunoblotting with the anti-T7 monoclonal antibody. The results showed specific interaction between the endogenous MAT1 and T7-MTA1 in MCF7/MTA1 cells but not in MCF7/pCDNA cells (Fig. 1 D). Next, we used T47D breast cancer cells that express both MAT1 as well as MTA1 to demonstrate the interaction between the endogenous MAT1 and MTA1. Immunoprecipitation of lysate from exponentially growing cells with anti-MTA1 antibody was followed by Western blotting with anti-MAT1 antibody. The results show that endogenous MTA1 and endogenous MAT1 do interact with each other (Fig. 1 E). To explore the spatial relationship between MTA1 and MAT1 and further validate their interactions in vivo, we utilized immunofluorescence and confocal scanning microscopy. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with Myc-tagged MTA1 and stained using antibodies against c-Myc antibody to detect c-Myc-MTA1 (green) or anti-MAT1 antibody to detect the endogenous MAT1 (red), and DNA was counterstained with the DNA dye Tropo3 (blue). Areas of colocalization of the red and green signals show yellow fluorescence (Fig. 1 F). In nontransfected cells, MAT1 protein was spread diffusely in the cytoplasm and absent from the nucleus (Fig. 1 F). This result is in agreement with previous reports on the subcellular distribution of MAT1 (33Korsisaari N. Makela T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34837-34840Google Scholar). Transfected MTA1 was concentrated in the nucleus, as expected (7Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Google Scholar). Importantly, MAT1 was also concentrated in the nucleus selectively in Myc-MTA1 transfected cells, where it colocalized with Myc-MTA1 (Fig.1 F, right panel). Together, these observations suggested that MAT1 could interact with Myc-MTA1 under physiological conditions, suggesting the possible influence of MTA1 on the functions of MAT1 in breast cancer cells. To explore the significance of MAT1 in breast tissues, we examined MAT1 protein expression levels in normal mouse tissues and human breast cancer cell lines. MAT1 protein was easily detectable in both ER-positive (MCF7, ZR75 and T47D) and ER-negative (MDA-MB231, MDA-MB453 and BT474) cell lines (Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, various levels of MAT1 protein were present in many mouse tissues, with the highest level in the thyroid and mammary glands of pregnant mice (Fig. 2 C). To explore the significance of MAT1 in human breast tumors, we investigated whether MAT1 protein expression was altered in paired normal human breast epithelium and breast carcinoma biopsy samples. As shown in Fig.3 A, MAT1 expression was elevated in 8 tumors of 12 as compared with the adjacent normal tissue, which showed either or no expression of MAT1. In 6 of the MAT1-overexpressing tumors, there was also up-regulation of MTA1. The blots were reprobed for vinculin as a loading control. Densitometric scanning of MAT1 and MTA1 protein bands suggested the existence of statistically significant up-regulation of both proteins in breast tumors as compared with adjacent normal appearing tissues (Fig.3 B). To validate these results, we immunostained paraffin-embedded paired tissue specimens with an anti-MAT1 monoclonal antibody. Two representative examples in Fig. 3 C demonstrate an intense MAT1 nuclear staining in tumor tissue, and normal tissue showed no positive staining.Figure 3MAT1 expression in human breast tumors. A, paired breast tumors (T) and adjacent normal (N) tissue were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. B, densitometric quantitation of MTA1 and MAT1 signals.

MTA1 has several important domains involved in protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, and signaling (Fig.4 A). Several C-terminal MTA1 deletion constructs were generated and expressed as35S-labeled proteins and then subjected to GST pull-down assays with the GST-MAT1 fusion proteins. The results suggest that amino acids 1–164 of MTA1, which contain the bromo-domain, and 389–441 amino acids representing the GATA domain constitute the binding regions for MAT1 (Fig. 4 B).

In previous experiments we and others have shown that the tyrosine kinase Lck is required for adequate apoptosis induction in response to ionizing radiation, ceramide incubation and overexpression of the HIV-TAT protein. However, the position of Lck within given apoptotic signaling cascades remains unclear. We therefore aimed to define the role of Lck during radiation-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis induction in response to ionizing radiation, CD95 or TRAIL receptor stimulation was determined in Jurkat T-cells, the Lck-deficient Jurkat clone JCaM1.6- and Lck-retransfected JCaM1.6/Lck. No apoptosis, release of cytochrome c, breakdown of the mitochondrial potential were detectable during the first 48 h after irradiation of JCaM1.6 cells. In parallel, no activation of caspase-9, -8 and -3 was detectable. Since mitochondrial apoptosis pathways act within a feedback mechanism during death-receptor-mediated apoptosis, the influence of the Lck defect on CD95/Fas/Apo-1-L or TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also tested. Both stimuli induced apoptosis in Lck-deficient cells. However, the kinetics of apoptosis induction determined by caspase-8, -9 and -3 activation as well as ΔΨm breakdown was slowed. We conclude that the Lck deficiency influences early steps during radiation-induced mitochondrial alterations."

In our laboratory we recently identified a number of specific human P-selectin-binding peptides containing a Glu-Trp-Val-Asp-Val consensus motif, displaying a low micromolar affinity for P-selectin (IC50 = 2 μm). In search of more potent antagonists for P-selectin, we have optimized the EWVDV pentapeptide core motif via a two-step combinatorial chemistry approach. A dedicated library of peptide derivatives was generated by introducing seven substituents at the N and C termini of the motif. In particular, pentapeptides with gallic acid or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid substituents at the N terminus proved to be considerably more potent inhibitors of P-selectin binding than the parental peptide. After removal of the N-terminal glutamic acid from the core sequence, which appeared to be replaceable by a carboxamide function without loss of affinity, a second library was synthesized to map the chemical moieties within the gallic acid or 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxyl acid groups responsible for the enhanced P-selectin binding. Moreover, by varying the length and rigidity of the connective spacer, we have further optimized the spatial orientation of the N-terminal substituent. The combined use of phage display and subsequent combinatorial chemistry led to the design of a number of gallic acid- containing peptides with low nanomolar affinity for P-selectin both under static and dynamic conditions (IC50 = 15.4 nm). These small synthetic antagonists, which are equally as potent as the natural ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, are promising leads in anti-atherothrombotic therapy.

In fact, P-selectin deficiency in mice has been shown to reduce atherosclerotic lesion formation (5Mayadas T.N. Johnson R.C. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Wagner D.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Also, P-selectin activation induces hypercoagulance of platelets and mediates platelet-monocyte aggregation and has thus been associated with thrombosis (6Andre P. Hartwell D. Hrachovinova I.

Therefore, intervention in P-selectin-mediated processes is an attractive therapeutic entry. The endogenous ligand for P-selectin is P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1),1 a 220-kDa disulfide-linked homodimeric sialomucin (10Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1179-1186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). P-selectin binding to PSGL-1 proceeds via a short N-terminal amino acid sequence of the latter, containing three sulfated tyrosines and a sialyl Lewis X (sLeX, Neu5Acα2–3Galβ1–4[Fucα1–3]GlcNAc) moiety (11Norgard K.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Most P-selectin antagonists are carbohydrate derivatives of the sLeX structure (15Simanek E.E. McGarvey G.J. Jablonowski J.A. Wong C.H. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 833-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, as compared with PSGL-1, these glycosides are relatively poor and unselective P-selectin inhibitors, because binding to the other selectin family members (E- and L-selectin) is equally affected. In our lab we recently identified, through the use of phage display, a number of human P-selectin-binding peptides containing an EWVDV pentapeptide consensus motif (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding of these peptides to human P-selectin was calcium-dependent and highly specific over E- and L-selectin. With its IC50 of 8 μm, the stripped pentapeptide already appeared to be much more potent than most of the sLeX-derived carbohydrate ligands. For therapeutic purposes, however, the affinity of an antagonist has to be in the low nanomolar range. We obtained this affinity by tetrameric exposure of the EWVDV peptide on streptavidin (IC50 = 2 nm). However, streptavidin-peptide complexes are rather inadequate for in vivo use, and smaller synthetic leads are pharmaceutically much more interesting. For this reason an optimization of the core sequence was performed. In this paper, we describe the rational design of potent monomeric P-selectin antagonists using a combinatorial chemistry strategy with the consensus motif (E)WVDV as core sequence. A structure-activity study yielded a number of peptide derivatives that are equally as potent as the natural ligand PSGL-1. Fmoc protected amino acids, 1-hydroxybezotriazole (HOBt), 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), and 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid (HMPA) were purchased from Nova Biochem (Läufelingen, Switzerland), except Fmoc-4-aminobenzoic acid, Fmoc-(4-aminomethyl)-benzoic acid, and Fmoc-tranexamic acid, which were from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France). Trifluoroacetic acid, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Dipea), dichloromethane, dichloroethane,N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), piperidine, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidine were of peptide grade and purchased from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, The Netherlands). 4-Dimethylaminopyridine was obtained from Janssen (Beersse, Belgium).N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, hydrazine monohydrate, and all of the carboxylic acids were obtained from Acros (Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands). N-Methylmorpholine was obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Tentagel S-NH2 (0.26 mmol/g) was from Rapp Polymer (Tübingen, Germany). Triisopropylsilane, goat anti-human IgG (Fc-specific), and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma-Aldrich. TM11-biotin (biotin-CDVEWVDVSSLEWDLPC) was synthesized by Dr. Van der Zee (Department of Immunology, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Human P-selectin/IgG-Fc and human E-selectin/IgG-Fc chimeras were kindly provided by Drs. Appelmelk and Van Dijk (Free University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Human L-selectin and mouse P-selectin were purchased by R&D Systems Europe, Ltd. (Abingdon, UK). Streptavidin peroxidase was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and biotin-PAA-Lea-SO3H was from Synthesome (München, Germany). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzine/H2O2 was obtained from Pierce. RPMI 1640 medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from BioWhittaker Europe (Verviers, Belgium). Core sequence 9 FmocHN-Glu(OtBu)-Trp(Boc)-Val-Asp(OtBu)-Val-Lys(DDE)-γ-aminobutyric acid-HMPA-resin was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 9050 peptide synthesizer (Warrington, UK) using standard Fmoc chemistry. In short, Tentagel S-NH2 (load 0.26 mmol/g) was provided with HMPA as a linker, resulting in resin 8. Fmoc-γ-aminobutyric acid-OH (10 eq) was attached to the HMPA resin 8 under the agency ofN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (5 eq) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.5 eq). All other amino acids, with acid-labile side chain protection if necessary, were attached by coupling in the presence of HOBt/TBTU/Dipea (4, 4, and 8 eq, respectively). After coupling, the resin was washed with DMF,iso-propanol, and diethyl ether and subsequently dried. The solid phase synthesis of library 10 was performed using a Flexchem© system (Robbins Scientific). After removal of the N-terminal Fmoc group of sequence 9 by 20% piperidine in DMF, the resin was washed (in DMF) and dried. The resin was distributed in 10-mg quantities over a solvent-resistant 48-well filter plate. After washing with DMF, a mixture of the desired carboxylic acid (40 eq), BOP (20 eq), HOBt (20 eq), andN-methylmorpholine (100 eq) was added (total volume, 300 μl), and the suspended resin was incubated for 3 h. Subsequently, the resin was washed with DMF and incubated three times for 3 min with hydrazine monohydrate (2% in DMF) to remove the DDE group. After washing with DMF, a mixture of the second carboxylic acid, BOP, HOBt, and N-methylmorpholine (same amounts as described above) was added and once again incubated for 3 h. Peptides, which were only modified at the C-terminal lysine (peptides HP01–HP07), were first N-bocylated with di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (0.25 m) and Dipea (0.125 m) in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidine to protect the N-terminal amine function. After removal of the solvent, the peptides were cleaved off from the resin with a trifluoroacetic acid, triisopropylsilane, and water mixture (95:2.5:2.5, v/v/v). Each sample was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. Peptides 11–13, library 14, and peptides 27–33 were prepared in the same manner as described for library 10 from resin bound core sequence FmocHN-Trp(Boc)-Val-Asp(OtBu)-Val-HMPA-resin. Peptide 11 was acetylated using acetic anhydride (0.25 m) and Dipea (0.125 m) in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidine. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in ammonia (100 mm, 100 μl) and aqueous ammonium bicarbonate solution (5 mm, 400 μl). The peptide concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm (tryptophan; ε = 5.5 mm−1 cm−1). Absorptions were corrected for the absorption coefficient of the introduced carboxylic acid(s). Compound purity was checked randomly (∼10% of all compounds) by HPLC analysis on a C8 or C18 reversed phase column (Alltech, Breda, The Netherlands) using an acetonitrile/water gradient with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 280 nm and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Compounds in Tables I and IIwere all purified by HPLC analysis (>90%) and analyzed by mass spectrometry.Table IPeptides and their affinities for human P-selectin as determined by competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPeptideSequenceIC50aThe results are the averages of at least three experiments at eight different concentrations of peptide as determined in TM11-PO competition ELISA (see “Experimental Procedures”).μmTM11CDVEWVDVSSLEWDLPC2bFrom Molenaar et al.

TM11-PO, a tetrameric TM11/streptavidin peroxidase complex, were freshly prepared by incubating streptavidin peroxidase (8.4 μl, 2.0 μm) and TM11-biotin (biotin-CDVEWVDVSSLEWDLPC, 1.5 μl, 190 mm) for 2 h at room temperature in assay buffer. For competition studies, a 96-well microtiter plate (high binding, flat bottom; Costar, Corning, NY) was coated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml goat anti-human IgG in coating buffer (50 mmNaHCO3, pH 9.6). Subsequently, the wells were washed with assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in assay buffer). After washing with assay buffer, the wells were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with human P-selectin/IgG-Fc (0.3 μg/ml). Subsequently, the wells were washed with assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the TM11-PO complex or biotin-PAA-Lea-SO3. The wells were washed six times with washing buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in assay buffer). 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzine/H2O2 was added, and the wells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was halted by the addition of 2 mH2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. HL60 cells were fluorescently labeled by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 5 μmcalcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) in RPMI. These cells (50,000/well) were added to cultured CHO cells expressing P-selectin (CHO-P cells, cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mm nonessential amino acids, 5 mml-glutamine, and 20,000 units of penicillin/streptomycin), seeded in 96-well plates in the presence or absence of the P-selectin antagonists (1h, 4 °C) (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After gentle washing with RPMI, CHO-P-associated fluorescence was measured (λexc = 485, λem = 530 nm). Dynamic interactions between HL60 cells and CHO-P cells monolayers grown onto glass coverslips coated with 30 μg/ml collagen (collagen S type I; Roche Diagnosis, Brussel, Belgium) were analyzed in a parallel plate perfusion chamber as described (18Theilmeier G. Lenaerts T. Remacle C. Collen D. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 2725-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. The coverslip constituted the bottom of the chamber, and the actual chamber was formed by a 254-μm height silicon rubber gasket designed with a conically shaped flow path, thus resulting in a 3-fold increase of wall shear rate from the inlet of the chamber to the outlet. Calcein-AM-labeled HL60 cells suspended in RPMI (0.5 × 106/ml) were perfused at 37 °C with an inverted syringe pump (Harvard Instruments, South Natick, MA) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. By mounting the flow chamber on the table of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Diaphot; Nikon, Melville, NY) coupled to a Cohu CCD video camera (COHU Inc., San Diego, CA), HL60 cells translocation over CHO-P monolayers were observed at wall shear rates of 300 and 600 s−1, in the presence or absence of P-selectin antagonists added to HL60 suspensions 2 min before the onset of perfusion. Real time movies of 12 s (10 images/s), recorded at random positions in the flow path corresponding to chosen wall shear rates were stored into the memory of an attached computer and digitized with a Scion LG3 frame grabber (Scion Corp, Frederick, MD). The velocity of HL60 cells rolling over the CHO-P cells was determined by measuring the distance traveled by the HL60 cells during at least 1 s of flow, using the NIH Image program, version 6.1. In pursuit of P-selectin antagonists for intervention in inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, a cysteine-constrained phage-displayed peptide library was screened for P-selectin binders (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A number of positive clones, including TM11, were identified and sequenced for their peptide insert (Table I). Comparison of the peptides for sequence homology revealed a pentapeptide consensus motif, which was established to be critical for human P-selectin binding by subsequent truncation and alanine scanning: EWVDV. With its low micromolar affinity, we argued that the therapeutic potential of the EWVDV peptide would greatly benefit from further optimization studies. Instead of conventional replacement of individual amino acids by naturally occurring amino acids, we preferred introduction of new chemical entities within the EWVDV core sequence by acylation of available amine groups to enhance the affinity for P-selectin. This flexible strategy enables the introduction of an infinite range of substituents and already has been shown effective for the optimization of an SH2 binding peptide by Yeh et al. (19Yeh R.H. Lee T.R. Lawrence D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12235-12240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although Yeh et al. used a vast peptide library (∼103 peptides) for screening, we considered a stepwise optimization protocol on the basis of dedicated libraries of approximately 100 EWVDV analogues to be at least equally effective and more practical. In the first screening step we have addressed the effect of substituting the N and C termini of the EWVDV motif with seven different moieties (Fig. 1,acyl moieties 1–7), resulting in a library of 63 compounds. The N-terminal amine group within the peptide was readily available for coupling to the carboxylic acids after removal of the protecting Fmoc group. To enable modification at the C terminus, however, a DDE-protected lysine was introduced behind the last valine of the core peptide. The DDE group can be selectively removed with 2% hydrazine without affecting the acid-labile side chain protecting groups (20Bycroft B.W. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; : 778-782Crossref Google Scholar), thus allowing independent introduction of substituents at either site of the peptide. Starting from Tentagel S-NH2 resin with an acid-labile HMPA linker (resin 8), core sequence 9 was synthesized using HOBt/TBTU/Dipea couplings. The first amino acid, γ-aminobutyric acid, was introduced to increase the distance between the C-terminal carboxylic acid and the amine function of the lysine. After the introduction of carboxylic acids 1–7, library 10 was cleaved from the resin by incubation with a trifluoroacetic acid/triisopropylsilane/H2O mixture (Fig.2). To elucidate peptides with enhanced P-selectin binding as compared with the EWVDV core, all of the crude peptides were tested below the IC50 of the EWVDV peptide (IC50 = 6 μm) at 5 μm in a competition assay for binding TM11-PO to P-selectin (Fig.3). This complex was previously shown to be a potent and specific ligand for P-selectin (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Peptides with N-terminal 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (acyl moiety 1) or gallic acid (acyl moiety 6) substituents were found to be most effective in inhibiting P-selectin binding: > 90% as compared with only 35% for the unsubstituted reference. The C-terminal counterparts, peptides HP01 and HP06, were considerably less effective, whereas the disubstituted peptides HP11 and HP66 were equally as potent as the N-terminal monosubstituted peptides HP10 and HP60 (peptides are coded HPij, where i and j refer to the acyl moieties attached to the N and C termini, respectively; N/C-terminally unmodified amino group is indicated by 0). Therefore, for the second optimization step we shifted our attention to the N-terminal substitution, thus obviating the introduction of a potentially perturbing lysine group at the C-terminal end.Figure 3Ability of peptides HP10-HP77 to inhibit ligand binding to human P-selectin. The crude peptides were tested in a competition assay for their ability to displace binding of TM11-PO to human P-selectin. Each bar represents the binding of TM11-PO in the presence of peptide (5 μm,n = 3–5 ± S.E.). The peptides are coded HPij, where i and j refer to the acyl moiety attached to the N and C termini, respectively. The N/C-terminally unmodified amino group is indicated by 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Earlier observations already suggested that the N-terminal amide function rather than the complete glutamic acid moiety is necessary for potent P-selectin binding (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Peptides KWVDV and AWVDV were equally potent inhibitors of P-selectin binding, but the absence of an N-terminal amide function (WVDV) led to a complete loss in binding capacity (Table I). To conclusively demonstrate the involvement of the amide group in P-selectin binding, we have synthesized Ac-WVDV (Peptide 11). Indeed, Ac-WVDV was found to inhibit P-selectin binding at a similar potency as the core sequence EWVDV. Likewise, when gallic acid (acyl moiety 6), the most potent substituent of the first library, was attached directly to the α-amine group of WVDV (peptide 12), this had similar potency as when the longer EWVDV core was used instead (peptide 13) (IC50 = 37 versus 31 nm, respectively). On the basis of the above findings, a new library of 42 substituted WVDV peptides was designed (Fig.4 A, library 14). This dedicated library served two purposes. First, the length and flexibility of the linker between the N-terminal substituent group and the WVDV motif were varied to optimize the spatial orientation of the substituent. Carboxylic acids R3 were attached directly to the α-amino group of the WVDV core or via a glycine or aminobutyric acid spacer (linkers R4). Second, to be able to pinpoint the actual groups within 1,3,5-benzene carboxylic acid and gallic acid responsible for the enhanced affinity of peptides HP10 and HP60, several carboxylic acids resembling these carboxylic acids were introduced at the N-terminal amine (carboxylic acids R3). In addition, a range of other anionic substituents was introduced to mimic the negatively charged tyrosine sulfates and the neuraminic acid of sLeX of PSGL-1. These moieties have been shown to be crucial for high P-selectin binding, possibly through occupation of a second binding site on P-selectin (12Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J.

Because a number of peptides from library 10 could displace TM11-PO binding above 90% at a 5 μm concentration, the peptides from library 14 were tested at 1 μm. At this concentration,l-cysteic acid-derived (acyl moiety 15) and 5-sulfosalicyclic acid-derived (acyl moiety 16) peptides gave up to 40% inhibition of TM11-PO binding, which is comparable with the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid-derivatized peptides (acyl moiety 1) (Fig. 4 B). Attachment of nitroaryl (acyl moiety 17) or fluoroaryl groups (acyl moiety 18) resulted in peptides equally as potent as EWVDV, displaying a nonsignificant 5% inhibition at this concentration. Removal of one of the carboxyl acids of substituent 1, by introduction of carboxylic acids 19–21, did not considerably reduce the affinity for P-selectin, regardless of the position and flexibility of the remaining groups (Fig. 4 C). Replacement of the carboxylic acid by an hydroxyl group (carboxylic acid 1 by 22) did not influence P-selectin binding either, suggesting that the gain in affinity is mediated by hydrogen bridging rather than electrostatic interactions. Contrary to the effect of the carboxylic acids, the number of exposed hydroxyls appear to be critical for its affinity, because monobenzoic acid-derivatized (acids 23 and 24) and dihydroxybenzoic acid-derivatized (acid 25) peptides were much less effective than the trihydoxylated counterparts (1McEver R.P. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11025-11028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D). Importantly, P-selectin binding was completely abolished after conversion of the hydroxyls into methyl ethers (via introduction of acid 26). The spacer length R4 between the core motif and the substituent was of little influence. IC50 values for the peptides lacking an intermediate spacer or having a glycyl or amino buryrate spacer (peptides 12, 27, and 28, respectively) ranged from 37.1 to 15.4 nm (Table II). Further elongation of the spacer, however, to an amino hexanoate (C-6) (peptide 29) caused a significant decrease in affinity (IC50 = 62.9 nm). Because flexible spacers confer the advantage of minimal conformational constraints but at the same time cause a maximal loss in entropy after binding, it is preferable to insert a more rigid spacer between the substituent and the core motif, when possible. To investigate the effect of spacer flexibility on the affinity of the substituted peptides for P-selectin, we therefore introduced a number of equally sized, more rigid analogues. A cyclic l-proline linker (peptide 30) led to a 5-fold reduction of the IC50 to 250 nm. Use of a linear 4-amino benzoate spacer, which is conformationally locked and only allows axial rotation of the gallic acid moiety (peptide 31), let to a complete loss in affinity (>1000 nm). Interestingly, binding is partially recovered when inserting an additional CH2 group between linker and gallic acid (peptide 32), regardless of whether the cyclohexyl group is plain aromatic (phenyl; peptide 32) or chair/boat configured (cyclohexyl; peptide 33). Introduction of the gallic acid moiety did not influence the specificity of the peptides. Peptide 28, the most potent antagonist of this series, did not displace biotin-PAA-Lea-SO3H binding to either mouse P-selectin or human E- and L-selectin (Fig.5). This PAA-based conjugate of sulfated Lea was reported to bind with low nanomolar affinity to all selectins (17Weitz Schmidt G. Stokmaier D. Scheel G. Nifant'ev N.E. Tuzikov A.B. Bovin N.V. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Finally, we investigated peptide 28 for its ability to inhibit HL60 cell adhesion to P-selectin-transfected CHO cells (CHO-P cells) under static (Fig. 6) and flow conditions (Fig. 7). Monocyte-derived HL60 cells have a high expression of PSGL-1 (10Sako D. Chang X.J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M. Bean K.M. Ahern T.J. Furie B.

Peptide 28 was found to inhibit HL60 cell adhesion with an EC50 of 74 nm, indicating that it is an effective inhibitor of human P-selectin in a more physiological setting. Under flow conditions, the peptide significantly increased the rolling velocity of HL60 cells at concentrations as low as 50 nm, indicating a reduced interaction between PSGL-1 and P-selectin. Surprisingly, at 500 nm tethering to and rolling of HL60 cells along P-selectin expressing cells could be observed. This is in sharp contrast to the unmodified EWVDV peptide, which was unable to affect the rolling velocity or cell adhesion at the same concentration.Figure 7HL60 rolling velocities in flow chamber perfusion experiments. The velocity (μm/s) of calcein-AM-labeled HL60 cells rolling over CHO-P cell-coated coverslips at wall shear rates of 300 s−1 (white bars) and 600 s−1 (black bars), in the absence (control) or presence of peptide 28 (5, 50, and 500 nm) or EWVDV (500 nm)) was determined from real time movies. For each condition the velocity of at least 20 individual HL60 cells was measured in three to nine independent perfusion assays. The values represent the means ± S.E. of rolling velocities.no tethering means a too short contact time (< 0.1 s) between HL60 cells and CHO-P monolayers to allow velocity measurement.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The use of phage display in ligand discovery has been shown to be very effective over the last decade, in particular for ill-defined targets (24Adda C.G. Anders R.F. Tilley L. Foley M. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2002; 5: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25Hoess R.H. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 3205-3218Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Despite its apparent promise for the identification of peptide motifs as initial leads, phage display-based drug design has a number of setbacks. Derived leads often display affinity in the micromolar to millimolar range, which precludes direct use in a therapeutic setting. In addition phage display does not allow the introduction of unnatural amino acid derivatives or post-translational modifications. A conventional strategy to increase the affinity of the peptide ligands involves the systematic replacement of amino acids after having identified a minimal effective motif via alanine scanning and truncation studies (26Apletalina E.V. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Lindberg I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Blaber M. Baase W.A. Gassner N. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). An integrated approach in which lead peptides are optimized using combinatorial organic chemistry on the other hand will pave the way for non-amino acid modifications of the peptide leads and will greatly increase the number of possible substituents. The most convenient way to introduce these modifications and to generate large compound libraries involves the use of solid phase combinatorial chemistry. However, the synthesis of large peptide libraries puts serious demands on purification and screening of compounds to render the process viable. Small dedicated libraries of compounds with a stepwise approach may likely be equally effective for enhancing target affinity. In this study we have taken a phage display-derived peptide (16Molenaar T.J.M. Appeldoorn C.C.M. de Haas S.A.M. Michon I.N. Bonnefoy A. Hoylaerts M.F. Pannekoek H. van Berkel T.J.C. Kuiper J. Biessen E.A.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3570-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as a starting point for organic chemical optimization. This EWVDV pentapeptide was shown to specifically bind to P-selectin and antagonized HL60 adhesion to P-selectin-transfected cells. In a first library, seven different substituents were introduced by acylation of primary amine groups at either the N or C terminus. Affinity testing of the crude peptides, at a concentration just below the IC50of the parental EWVDV peptide to reduce the number of hits (5 μm), revealed that N-terminal modification with 1,3,5-tricarboxybenzoic acid (carboxylic acid 1) or gallic acid (carboxylic acid 6) were most effective in inhibiting P-selectin binding (>90% inhibition versus 30% for the underivatized peptide). C terminus modifications had little to no influence on the affinity of the core peptide. The core peptide could even be reduced to WVDV after identification that the N-terminal amide rather than the glutamic acid was imperative for P-selectin binding. However, when a negatively charged Glu or Asp before the WVDV was present, P-selectin binding was slightly improved compared with other uncharged amino acids like Ala and Lys. Negatively charged groups within PSGL-1, i.e. tyrosine sulfates and the neuraminic acid of sLeX, are found to be crucial for P-selectin binding (11Norgard K.E. Moore K.L. Diaz S. Stults N.L.

This might imply that negatively charged amino acids Glu and Asp interact with P-selectin at a site proximal to the actual sLeX-binding site. Indeed the existence of a second binding pocket has already been speculated upon in a number of reports (12Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21Kansas G.S. Saunders K.B. Ley K. Zakrzewicz A. Gibson R.M. Furie B.C. Furie B. Tedder T.F. J.

A. 1993; 90: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), although solid evidence still remains to be provided. The derivatization of the core peptide with the gallic acid substituent, again the best substituent in our second library, would also allow occupation of both binding sites, thus explaining the considerably increased affinity. Of the introduced spacers, the elongated aminobutyric acid spacer performed best (peptide 28, IC50 = 15.4 nm). Introduction of longer or more rigid spacers led to a considerable loss in affinity, indicating that the spatial orientation of the terminal gallic acid group with respect to the peptide is critical. Peptide 28 was also tested for its ability to antagonize HL60 adhesion to P-selectin under both static and dynamic conditions. PSGL-1-mediated adhesion to P-selectin was impaired at 50 nm and even completely blocked at 500 nm. In conclusion, we show in this study that stepwise optimization of peptide leads through dedicated small peptide libraries is a very efficient strategy. The affinity of the P-selectin binding sequence (E)WVDV was increased almost 800-fold via the introduction of a gallic acid moiety at the N terminus, as was shown in different testing systems. Thus, the combined use of phage display and subsequent combinatorial chemistry led to the design of P-selectin antagonists with nanomolar affinity. These small synthetic antagonists, which are equally potent as the natural ligand P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, may be promising leads in atherothrombotic therapy. For further in vivo use we plan to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of these compounds. Shifting our attention from peptides to peptidomimics would also decrease the susceptibility to proteases.

Here we report the cloning of a cDNA encoding the human homologue of SLAP-2, as well as the genomic structure of the human SLAP-2 gene. Similar to its murine counterpart, two human SLAP-2 protein isoforms exist because of alternative translation initiation, and SLAP-2 protein expression is observed in a variety of hematopoietic cell lines of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. The human SLAP-2 gene is located on chromosome 20q, and the SLAP-2 coding region consists of seven exons. Concurrent with the cloning of the full-length SLAP-2 cDNA, a unique cDNA encoding an alternatively spliced SLAP-2 isoform has been identified, and designated as SLAP-2-v. The SLAP-2-v transcript encodes a putative protein of 210 amino acids that lacks the c-Cbl interaction region, and consequently is impaired in its ability to both bind to c-Cbl, and inhibit TCR signalling relative to SLAP-2."

https://openalex.org/W2070844007,"The binding of MgATP and fructose-6-phosphate to phosphofructokinase-2 from <i>Escherichia coli</i> induces conformational changes that result in significant differences in the x-ray-scattering profiles compared with the unligated form of the enzyme. When fructose- 6-phosphate binds to the active site of the enzyme, the pair distribution function exhibits lower values at higher distances, indicating a more compact structure. Upon binding of MgATP to the allosteric site of the enzyme, the intensity at lower angles increases as a consequence of tetramer formation, but differences along higher angles also suggest changes at the tertiary structure level. We have used homology modeling to build the native dimeric form of phosphofructokinase-2 and fitted the experimental scattering curves by using rigid body movements of the domains in the model, similar to those observed in known homologous structures. The best fit with the experimental data of the unbound protein was achieved with open conformations of the domains in the model, whereas domain closure improves the agreement with the scattering of the enzyme-fructose-6-phosphate complex. Using the same approach, we utilized the scattering curve of the phosphofructokinase-2-MgATP complex to model the arrangement and conformation of dimers in the tetramer. We observed that, along with tetramerization, binding of MgATP to the allosteric site induces domain closure. Additionally, we used the scattering data to restore the low resolution structure of phosphofructokinase-2 (free and bound forms) by an <i>ab initio</i> procedure. Based on these findings, a proposal is made to account for the inhibitory effect of MgATP on the enzymatic activity."

The senescent cells maintained still the telomerase activity, which is frequently associated with immortal growth of human cells, suggesting that a telomerase-independent mechanism is involved in the senescence observed in this mouse cell line. To map the senescence-inducing gene to a specific chromosomal region, we took two experimental approaches: identification of a minimal region with the senescence-inducing activity via MMCT of a series of subchromosomal transferrable fragments (STFs), each consisting of a different profile of human chromosome 1-derived regions, and identification of a region commonly deleted from the transferred chromosome 1 in the revertant clones that escaped cellular senescence. These approaches identified a 2.7-3.0 Mb of senescence-inducing region shared among the active STFs and a 2.4-3.0 Mb of commonly deleted region in the revertant clones. These two regions overlapped each other to map the responsible gene at the 450 to 600-kb interval between UniSTS93710 and D1S3542 on chromosome 1q42.3. This study provides essential information and materials for cloning and characterization of a novel senescence-inducing gene that functions in a telomerase-independent pathway, which is likely to be conserved between mice and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2015295275,"Recent evidence, obtained in a reconstituted RNA polymerase II transcription system, indicated that the promoter escape stage of transcription requires template DNA located downstream of the elongating polymerase. In the absence of downstream DNA, very early elongation complexes are unable to synthesize transcripts longer than ∼10–14 nucleotides. In contrast, once transcripts longer than ∼15 nucleotides have been synthesized, an extended region of downstream DNA is no longer required (Dvir, A., Tan, S., Conaway, J. W., and Conaway, R. C.

The polymerase can be forced to arrest at several points prior to the completion of promoter escape by removing downstream DNA proximally to positions 40/42.

Stable binding of RNA polymerase II to the promoter requires minimally the presence of the general transcription factors TFIID1 (or TBP), TFIIB, and TFIIF. Before transcription can begin, the double-stranded structure of the DNA template surrounding the initiation site on the promoter needs to be melted into single-stranded DNA in a process that is referred to as open complex formation (3Roeder R.G.

This phase primarily includes the formation of the first 10–15 phosphodiester bonds of nascent RNA transcripts and is characterized by functional instability of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex (10Dvir A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 218-223Google Scholar). In the absence of either TFIIH or an ATP(dATP) cofactor, early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates are prone to premature arrest at ∼10 to ∼14 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site (11Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Dvir A. C C.R. W C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast, further transcript elongation by very early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates that have successfully synthesized transcripts 14 or 15 nucleotides long requires neither TFIIH nor an ATP(dATP) cofactor. Finally, completion of promoter escape depends on the presence of an extended region of downstream DNA; digestion of a duplex template containing the AdML promoter with a restriction enzyme that cuts the template 35/39 nucleotides downstream of the DNA template has no effect on initiation but results in arrest by RNA polymerase II at a position 10–15 nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site. However, once polymerase has successfully synthesized ∼14 nucleotide transcripts, digestion of the template with the same restriction enzyme has no effect on further elongation by RNA polymerase II (13Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on these characteristics, we operationally define early RNA polymerase II elongation complexes that have synthesized transcripts ∼15 nucleotides or longer as those that have successfully escaped the promoter. During the transcription cycle, promoter escape follows immediately after initiation. There are a number of notable similarities between these two very early stages of transcription; both share a requirement for an ATP(dATP) cofactor and depend on the presence of TFIIE and TFIIH (6Dvir A.

Finally, initiation, like promoter escape, depends on the presence of an extended downstream DNA region, which has been shown to extend to somewhere between 23 and 35 nucleotides downstream of the transcriptional start site (13Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although previous studies have provided strong support for the model that interactions between component(s) of the transcription complex and downstream DNA are important for both initiation and promoter escape, a variety of important questions regarding the structure and function of downstream DNA remain unanswered. These include the following. (i) What are the precise boundaries of the regions required to support transcription initiation and promoter escape? (ii) Does the requirement for downstream DNA in promoter escape depend on downstream DNA sequence? (iii) Is the completion of promoter escape accompanied by a major rearrangement of the transcription complex? The experiments presented here provide evidence that the downstream DNA requirements do not change significantly through the synthesis of the first 14–15 bonds of nascent transcripts, that downstream DNA operates in a sequence-independent manner, and that a major conformational change in the transcription complex likely happens at the completion of promoter escape. The primary DNA template used in this study is M13mp19-AdML, which contains original AdML promoter sequences from −50 to 10 (12). AdML promoter mutants were prepared by the uracil-containing DNA method for site-directed mutagenesis (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar), using the Bio-Rad Mutagen 2 system. Resulting clones were verified by sequencing. For transcription, a 444-base pair fragment was produced by PCR from M13mp19-AdML. The primers were 5′-GACGGCCAGTGAATTCGA and 5′-CCAGCGTGGACCGCTTGC. The resulting DNA fragment, which contains sequences that extend 77 bp upstream and 367 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site, was gel-purified by agarose gel electrophoresis prior to use in transcription reactions. Hybrid templates were prepared containing the core T7 promoter fused to AdML promoter sequences with downstreamHaeIIII restriction sites. The T7 promoter sequence was introduced to the AdML templates by performing PCR using M13mp19-AdML derivatives as templates. We used an upstream PCR primer consisting of the T7 promoter: 5′(−25)-ATGGTACCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAACTCTCTTCCTCTAGAGTCG. The underscored sequence is a 20-base sequence complimentary to the AdML template strand at promoter positions 1–20. At the 5′ end of the T7 promoter, a six-base “clamp” sequence has been added (18Jorgensen E.D. Durbin R.K. Risman S.S. McAllister W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 645-651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The downstream primer was (5′-CCAGCGTGGACCGCTTGC), identical to that used in the AdML template amplification reactions. The M13mp19-AdML templates used had HaeIII sites positioned at 34, 40, and 44 relative to the AdML start site. Because T7 begins transcription at −6 relative to the AdML insertion, after digestion of templates withHaeIII the resulting transcripts are 40, 46, and 50 nt long. T7-AdML template amplification was carried out in 100 μl with 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm each of dNTPs (dATP, dCTP, dTTP, dGTP), 50.0 pmol of each primer, and 830 fmol of M13mp19-AdML template DNA. The length of the PCR product is 398 bp. PCR products were gel-purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA polymerase II (19Serizawa H. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Inostroza J. Maxon M.E. Flores O. Admon A. Reinberg D. Tjian R. Nature. 1991; 354: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), except that the 56-kDa subunit was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS. Recombinant TFIIF was purified as described (25Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 824-828PubMed Google Scholar) from E. coli JM109(DE3) coinfected with M13mpET-RAP30 and M13mpET-RAP74. Transcription experiments are performed in vitro using a reconstituted transcription system that includes RNA polymerase II, the five general transcription factors (TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH), and gel-purified promoter-DNA. Promoter DNA and proteins are combined in a final volume of 30 μl to form preinitiation complexes during a 30 °C, 45-min incubation (11Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The incubation buffer contains (final concentrations are given) 0.3 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.9, 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol, and 6% (v/v) glycerol. Each reaction included 20 ng of AdML DNA fragment, 50 ng of recombinant yeast TBP, 10 ng of recombinant TFIIB, 20 ng of recombinant TFIIF, 20 ng of recombinant TFIIE, 150 ng of highly purified TFIIH, and 0.01 units of RNA polymerase II. Digestion of template DNA by PstI or HaeIII endonuclease was included in various phases of the transcription experiment by adding 2 μl of a solution containing 0.1–0.5 units of the respective enzymes. Digestions were carried at 30 °C for the times indicated, mostly 20 min. Separate experiments were carried to verify that these conditions allowed for complete digestions. Transcription was initiated by a labeling mix containing [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), a CpU dinucleotide primer, ATP or dATP cofactor, and other ribonucleoside triphosphates as described in the figure legends. The final volume of reaction mixes was 35 μl. Transcription was carried at 30 °C for the time indicated in the figure legends. Transcription was stopped by addition of 15 μl of stop solution containing 100 mm EDTA. A 55-μl loading dye containing 10.0 m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanole was added to each sample. Samples were then heated to 90 °C for 3 min, briefly centrifuged to remove insoluble particles, and separated on a 25% acrylamide, 3% bisacrylamide, 6.0m urea gel as described (6Dvir A. Garrett K.P. Chalut C. Egly J.M. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7245-7248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography. For run-off transcription experiments, reactions were stopped by addition of 0.05 m EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5% SDS to the reaction mixture. Precipitation is accomplished by ethanol followed by a 70% ethanol wash. Dried pellets were resuspended in 27 μl of solution of 10 m urea, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanol FF, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, then loaded on urea-containing acrylamide gels for electrophoretic separation of transcripts. T7-AdML templates obtained by PCR above were digested withHaeIII prior to transcription by combining T7-AdML PCR product, 1 unit of HaeIII, and 1× enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) in a 10-μl reaction incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The RNA markers were synthesized in vitro as follows; reactions of 50 μl included 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase, 1× enzyme buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 6 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 10 mmdithiothreitol), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μmATP, 100 μm UTP, 100 μm GTP, 5 μm cold CTP, 67 nm[α-32P]CTP, and pre-digested T7-AdML DNA template. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by using the same solutions, and protocols as are used to stop RNA polymerase II transcription reactions by the run-off protocol. To map precisely the extent of downstream DNA required at specific stages of early transcription, we generated a series of AdML promoter-containing constructs that contain restriction sites for the endonuclease HaeIII at various distances downstream of the transcription initiation site. The locations of the newly inserted cleavage sites correspond to promoter positions 26–50 from the start site in the AdML promoter (Fig. 1). When treated with HaeIII, these DNA templates acquire new, shorter ends that differ by 2-nucleotide increments from each other. In addition, following cleavage by HaeIII, templates are left with blunt ends, and the 3′ end of the templates differs from the sequence of the original, parental plasmid by at most 2 nucleotides. In our studies of early transcription by RNA polymerase II, we utilized a transcription system reconstituted with recombinant TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF and purified polymerase and TFIIH from rat liver. Promoter-specific initiation was assayed by measuring synthesis of abortive, dinucleotide-primed trinucleotide transcripts. As shown previously, transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II from the AdML promoter can be primed by a variety of dinucleotides. These dinucleotides must be complementary to template DNA surrounding the transcriptional start site (26Samuels M.A. Fire A. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2517-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We assayed the synthesis of the first phosphodiester bond of nascent transcripts by measuring synthesis of trinucleotide transcripts in reactions containing the initiating dinucleotide CpU and [α-32P]CTP. These nucleotides support synthesis by polymerase of radioactively labeled CpUpC transcripts initiated at a position 3 base pairs upstream of the normal AdML transcriptional start site. To measure promoter escape, we monitor the synthesis of short transcripts in reactions containing the initiating dinucleotide CpU, ATP, UTP, [α-32P]CTP, as well as the RNA chain-terminating nucleotide 3′-O-methylguanosine triphosphate (3′-O-MeGTP). The maximal transcript length under these conditions is 18 nucleotides, determined by the insertion of 3′-O-MeGTP at the first G downstream of the initiation site. Because early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates that have synthesized transcripts of ∼15 nucleotides or longer are considered to have successfully escaped the promoter, formation of the 3′-O-MeGTP terminated transcripts is a useful assay for the completion of promoter escape (11Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23352-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Dvir A. C C.R. W C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9006-9010Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Previous experiments (13Dvir A. Tan S. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28175-28178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have shown that initiation is strongly inhibited by cleaving an AdML promoter-containing template (pDN-AdML) withPstI, which cuts at position 23/27 and to a lesser degree by cleaving with SphI or HindIII, which cut at positions 29/33 and 35/39, respectively. However, these results only roughly defined the downstream border of the DNA required for initiation. In addition, because HindIII leaves a 5′ overhang and PstI leaves a 3′ overhang, the results of these earlier experiments could have been affected by the difference in DNA ends left by the different restriction enzymes used. In the experiments presented here, we used the abortive initiation assay described above to compare the activities of the Ad+26 through Ad+32 templates, with or without prior cleavage by HaeIII. As shown in Fig. 2, the promoters on all templates were capable of supporting abortive initiation when not cleaved with HaeIII, although several (Ad+30 and Ad+34) appeared somewhat less efficient. Following HaeIII cleavage, however, very little initiation occurred on the Ad+26 and Ad+28 templates. An intermediate level of initiation was observed followingHaeIII cleavage of the Ad+30, Ad+32, and Ad+34 templates, whereas HaeIII cleavage had little or no effect on initiation from the Ad+36 and Ad+40 templates. Thus, DNA downstream of position 34 is largely dispensable for initiation from the AdML promoter, and the region of downstream DNA most critical for initiation extends to 28 base pairs downstream of the transcriptional start site. To determine the extent of downstream DNA required for efficient promoter escape, templates that can be cleaved with HaeIII at positions from 34 to 46 base pairs downstream of the site of transcription initiation were tested for their abilities to support promoter escape, with and without prior treatment withHaeIII. As shown in Fig. 3, both transcription initiation and promoter escape were supported on all templates not treated with HaeIII. Cleavage of the Ad+42, Ad+44, and Ad+46 templates with HaeIII prior to transcription reactions had very little or no effect on the efficiency of promoter escape, as measured by synthesis of 18 nucleotide, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcripts. Thus, DNA downstream of 42 is dispensable for promoter escape. In contrast, the efficiency of promoter escape was substantially reduced when the Ad+34, Ad+36, Ad+38, and Ad+40 templates were treated with HaeIII prior to the reactions, indicating that DNA extending to 40 is needed for efficient promoter escape. Notably, the length of the longest major transcripts synthesized following HaeIII cleavage depended on the position of the HaeIII cleavage sites. Thus, the lengths of the longest major transcripts were 8, 11, and 13–14 nt following cleavage with HaeIII at 34, 36, and 38, respectively, whereas cleavage at 40 allowed synthesis of a reduced level of 18-nt, 3′-O-MeG-terminated transcript. In Fig. 3, HaeIII digestion is performed before transcription initiation. To examine the effect of downstream DNA on promoter escape alone, we utilized a two-step, pulse-chase transcription protocol. In the first stage of the reaction, RNA synthesis was carried out in the presence of limiting concentrations of radioactive nucleotides, resulting in the formation of “pre-escaped” transcription complexes containing 3–9-nucleotide-long RNA transcripts. This initiation stage was followed by a chase phase, in which a large excess of unlabeled nucleotides was added, allowing further extension of transcripts and completion of promoter escape. Reaction conditions can be selectively changed between the two stages, allowing for the assessment of specific template and cofactor requirements for promoter escape. In the experiment of Fig. 4, we included a 15-min incubation with HaeIII to allow cleavage of downstream DNA between the pulse and chase stages of the reactions. This experiment was performed using promoters with restriction sites at positions 36, 38, 40, 42, and 44. Four transcription reactions were performed with each of the mutant templates; transcription in two of the reactions included only the labeling step, whereas in the other two it also included the cold chase phase. In each pair, one reaction was incubated with the HaeIII endonuclease at the end of the labeling stage. The other reaction served as a “noHaeIII” control. Transcripts at the end of the labeling stage of the reaction were 3–9 nucleotides long. The 3-nucleotide-long product is abortive, and the remaining bands corresponded primarily to 5- and 7-nucleotide-long transcripts. Addition of HaeIII to the “pulse-only” reactions did not significantly affect the length or amount of transcripts detected. The other two lanes shown for each template are reactions in which a cold nucleotide chase phase was added following the HaeIII treatment. Chase reactions were performed in the presence of ATP. As in the first two lanes, one reaction included a HaeIII treatment and the other was a “no HaeIII” control. In all the templates in the control lanes, promoter escape was supported to a similar level, as judged by the level of 18-nucleotide-long, 3′-O-MeGTP-terminated transcripts. In reactions that included a HaeIII treatment, significant differences appeared between the various templates. On templates with theHaeIII restriction sites at positions 36 and 38, promoter escape was substantially suppressed. The 40 promoter showed an intermediate level of inhibition, and the 42 promoter showed only slight inhibition. Promoter escape on the template with aHaeIII site at 44 was not affected by the endonuclease. Therefore, in the two-step promoter escape experiment, DNA up to position 40/42 from the transcription initiation site appears critical for efficient promoter escape. This result is in full agreement with the result obtained in the single-step promoter escape experiment (Fig.3). The experiment presented in Fig. 4 provides additional information regarding transcription complexes that became arrested at promoter-proximal positions. The reduction in the level of promoter escape is accompanied by an increase in the level of promoter proximal arrest. This is evident by a new pattern of arrested RNA transcripts 11–15 nucleotides in length formed in reactions containing templates cut at positions 36 through 42. Small, but highly reproducible differences in the size distribution of arrested transcripts formed on the various templates can be recognized. Arrested transcripts were primarily 11 and 12 nucleotides in length on the 36 promoter, 12 and 13 nucleotides for the 38 template, and 13 and 14 nucleotides for the 40 template. On the 42 template, which is only slightly affected byHaeIII treatment, arrested transcripts were primarily 14 and 15 nucleotides in length. Because transcription is primed with CpU at position −3 relative to the in vivo initiation site, the observed RNA length less 3 nucleotides corresponds to the precise location of the RNA polymerase catalytic site at the time when its progress was stopped. The distance between the end of the downstream DNA and the size of paused transcripts, as seen in Fig. 4, is ∼28 ± 2 nucleotides for all templates where escape was suppressed by HaeIII treatment. These results suggest that, during the individual steps of the promoter escape stage, the precise position of the polymerase is in phase with the distal end of the required downstream DNA. During promoter escape, the downstream DNA region does not function as a template for transcription as it is at a distance of more than 20 nucleotides downstream from the catalytic site of the polymerase. Instead, it is likely that the downstream region forms critical contacts with component(s) of the transcription complex. These interactions might directly involve TFIIH, based on evidence from UV-induced protein-DNA cross-linking studies (27Kim T.K. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D.
