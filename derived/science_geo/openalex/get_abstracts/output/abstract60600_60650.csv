https://openalex.org/W1492100345,"Abstract We previously postulated that thrombin might initiate platelet aggregation and the release reaction by acting at the platelet surface. We have now demonstrated surface binding of thrombin using highly purified bovine thrombin labeled with 125I. At least two classes of binding sites have been demonstrated. When studies are done at relatively high thrombin concentrations, platelets bind 50,000 thrombin molecules per platelet at saturation with an apparent dissociation constant of 2.9 units per ml (30 nm thrombin). Binding studies carried out at lower thrombin concentrations disclose that approximately 500 thrombin molecules bind per platelet with an apparent dissociation constant of 0.02 unit per ml (0.21 nm thrombin). The other properties of these two types of thrombin-binding sites were identical. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated thrombin (DIP-thrombin) binds to platelets with equal affinity and competes for the same sites as native thrombin, even though DIP-thrombin does not cause platelet aggregation or the release reaction. Experiments using high resolution electron microscopic autoradiography established that 125I-thrombin binds to the cell surface. The mean position of 400 grains was 490 ± 90 A (S.E.M.) external to the platelet plasma membrane, suggesting that bound thrombin is located in the glycoprotein coat of the platelet surface. Similar localization was found for 125I-lentil phytohemagglutinin, which is known to bind to a platelet surface oligosaccharide. Addition of excess unlabeled thrombin rapidly displaced g95% of 125I-thrombin previously bound to platelets, further suggesting that thrombin does not enter the cell. Although DIP-thrombin competitively inhibits binding of native thrombin, DIP-thrombin increases the extent of [14C]serotonin release when platelets are exposed to suboptimal concentrations of native thrombin. These findings suggest that thrombin induces the release reaction by a complicated mechanism involving both binding and proteolytic activities."

This confirms previous biochemical reports of high dopamine levels in the cortex. The histochemistry reveals that the distribution is regional and confined to the limbic cortex.
https://openalex.org/W1550639365,"Abstract Fragments of calf thymus chromatin that selectively resist micrococcal nuclease digestion are found to be highly compact nucleoprotein particles, each containing a single piece of tightly folded or supercoiled DNA. These particles exhibit an anomalous CD spectrum, and melt in the upper end of the chromatin melting range. Upon trypsin digestion, only about 20% of the protein is removed, but the properties of the particles are greatly modified. They unfold, as judged from hydrodynamic studies, the CD spectrum becomes very much like that of DNA, and the melting point drops by about 20°. We conclude that proteins in the particles serve to maintain the compact structure."
https://openalex.org/W1595729193,"Abstract RNA polymerase activity was solubilized from whole cell homogenates of cultured kidney cells and embryonic tissues of Xenopus laevis. Several chromatographic forms of RNA polymerase were distinguished in extracts from all tissues by ion exchange chromatography and are designated Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and III. Forms Ia and/or Ib, IIb, and III appear analogous to forms I, II, and III isolated from nuclei of other eukaryotes, whereas form IIa may be of cytoplasmic origin. The metal ion and ionic strength responses of each of the enzymes were examined. No differences were noted between Ia and Ib on the one hand, or between IIa and IIb the other. However, class I, II, and III enzymes were distinguishable by these criteria. Forms IIa and IIb were equally sensitive to α-amanitin, whereas the activities of forms Ia, Ib and III were unaffected by this toxin."

Isoelectric focusing in a sucrose gradient gave a pI of 5.81. The extinction coefficient (A1%280) was found to be 12.8 cm-1. Measurement of the partial specific volume gave a value of 0.745 ml per g. The intrinsic sedimentation coefficient (s020,w) was estimated as 6.0 ± 0.12 S, between pH 2.2 and 10.8, and as 2.15 ± 0.15 S in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 8 m urea, and 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. The molecular weight of the agglutinin, determined by sedimentation equilibrium and by gel filtration, was found to be 122,000 ± 1,300 and 120,000 ± 10,000, respectively. Disc gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, both in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and sedimentation equilibrium in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride gave a subunit molecular weight of 30,000 ± 1,500 and 30,300 ± 400, respectively. Four alanine residues per 120,000 g were found by amino-terminal analysis. It is concluded that the agglutinin is a tetramer composed of identical subunits. Two binding sites for N-acetyl-d-galactosamine were found per 120,000 daltons by equilibrium dialysis and gel filtration, with an association constant K = 3.0 x 104 liter mole-1."
https://openalex.org/W1559177712,"Abstract The amounts of the various forms of RNA polymerase (Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb, and III) have been determined in oocytes, eggs, and embryos of Xenopus laevis. During oogenesis the relative proportions of the enzymes remain nearly constant, although the absolute levels of all forms increase dramatically. As a result, the mature oocyte, as well as the unfertilized egg, contains 4 to 5 orders of magnitude more RNA polymerase activity than is present in an individual somatic cell. Both oocytes and eggs contain unusually high levels of forms III and IIa in addition to forms I and IIb which predominate in somatic cells. The amounts and relative proportions of the five enzymes in the unfertilized egg remain about the same up to gastrulation of the embryo. During subsequent stages of embryogenesis the total amounts of forms I and IIb increase about 10-fold while the amounts of forms IIa and III increase only slightly. The rapid increase in cell number along with this selective increase in forms I and IIb during early development re-establishes the same relative and absolute enzyme levels per cell in the swimming embryo that are present in adult somatic cells. Anucleolate mutant embryos at the early swimming stage have the same amount of each enzyme as do control embryos. Furthermore the relative amounts of the various enzymes in purified nuclei are the same in anucleolate embryos as they are in control embryos. Chromatographic heterogeneity in enzyme I was found at all stages of oocyte maturation and throughout embryogenesis of control and anucleolate mutant embryos."

https://openalex.org/W1531765690,"Abstract The interaction of various cations with the 55,000-dalton protein component of the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been studied by means of equilibrium dialysis and titration with fluorescence and difference absorption spectral techniques. The binding capacities for calcium or strontium are identical, viz. 55 moles per mole of protein, while for zinc the value is 140 moles per mole. It appears that calcium and strontium compete for the same sites, which are also available for zinc. Zinc also binds to additional sites that do not have appreciable affinity for the other cations. Changes in ultraviolet difference absorption spectra and in the intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence produced by binding of calcium, strontium, and zinc in the presence of 0.1 m KCl are correlated with the binding of cations to about 50 sites per molecule; binding of zinc to the additional sites does not entail spectral changes. The ultraviolet difference absorption spectrum developed on binding of divalent cations in the presence of 0.1 m KCl involves mainly tryptophyl residues; KCl alone at concentrations less than 0.1 m produces more complex spectral differences ascribable to several types of chromophores. The changes produced in fluorescence and ultraviolet absorption spectra by KCl at higher concentrations (e.g. 0.6 m) are identical with those obtained by adding divalent cations; no changes are produced by further addition of calcium to 0.6 m KCl. Changes in absorption and fluorescence appear to be due to transfer of aromatic residues from the polar surface to the hydrophobic interior of the protein. This process is, in part, accompanied by an increase in α helix as reflected in measurements of circular dichroism. The order of affinities of various cations on the basis of fluorescence titration is as follows: La3+ g Zn2+ g Cd2+ g Mn2+ g Ca2+ g Mg2+ ≃ Sr2+ >> K+; the affinities range from about 3.3 x 105 for La3+ through 500 for Mg2+ to 4 for K+. The selective removal of protein from the membrane by Triton X-100 is prevented by 4 mm Ca2+. The results have been interpreted in terms of the role the protein may play as a calcium storage site and in reducing the permeability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W1573504100,"Abstract The interaction of estradiol-17β with mature bovine endometrial tissue, and with isolated nuclei has been studied. The hormone binds to an insoluble nuclear fraction. This fraction contains membrane and evidence is presented to show that estradiol is bound to the nuclear membrane. Incubation of isolated nuclei and microsome fractions with estradiol-17β shows that the hormone binds essentially instantaneously to microsomes and nuclei. Such binding is non-saturable up to estradiol-17β concentrations as great as 2.5 x 10-6 moles per mg of membrane protein and it is likely that this interaction is not biologically significant. A second form of binding is observed in nuclei which is of higher affinity and saturable, with 507 ± 47 sites per nucleus. This class of binding sites is found to be blocked in cattle that are maintained in artificially induced estrus by feeding with diethylstilbesterol. The high affinity binding site is present only in the mature endometrium and is absent in nuclei from the mature myometrium (the muscular tissue surrounding the endometrium in the uterus) and the immature uterus. Potent estrogenic agents compete effectively with estradiol-17β for binding to this site, whereas weak estrogenic steroids (such as progesterone and testosterone) are inefficient competitors. The sensitivity of the high affinity site to pH and hydrolytic enzymes has been studied and compared with the effect of such agents on the low affinity, nonspecific, membrane site. Such a comparison underscores the inherent differences between these two sites of interaction. The thermodynamic parameters of the high affinity binding site have been measured and compared to reported values for the specific cytoplasmic receptor binding site. The nuclear high affinity binding site possesses a favorable free energy of interaction as a result of entropic forces (ΔS0 = +36.4 cal deg-1 mole-1, ΔH0 = -0.66 Cal mole-1). The number of high affinity nuclear sites varies dramatically during the estrous cycle in a bicyclic fashion. Sites are available during estrus and diestrus, whereas they are blocked in later metestrus and proestrus."
https://openalex.org/W1550734145,"Considerable evidence from previous work supports the concept that formate is one of several planar anions which may occupy the binding site of the transferable phosphoryl group on creatine kinase, thus transforming the enzyme-Mg-(II)-ADP-creatine complex into an analog of the transition state of the active complex. Two NMR double resonance techniques, internuclear double resonance (INDOR) spectroscopy and intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements of the formate proton, were employed to identify the binding site of formate on creatine kinase. The formate INDOR spectrum has a single peak at 2.6 ppm downfield from 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate due to dipole-dipole interaction of the formate proton with specific protons on the enzyme. The interacting protons are in close proximity to the formate proton and are characterized by a chemical shift of 2.6 ppm. Application of a strong radiofrequency field at 2.6 ppm results in a decrease in the intensity of the observed formate proton NMR peak, i.e. a negative NOE, for the transition state analog complex. The magnitude of the formate NOE depends on the formate to creatine kinase ratio, indicative of rapid exchange of formate between bound and free sites. Formate and nitrate compete for binding at the active site as shown by titration of the formate NOE with nitrate in the formate transition state analog complex. The large negative NOE for formate is obtained only in the case of the complex with creatine, Mg(II), and ADP. Omission of either of the substrates, creatine or ADP, or of the activator Mg(II) results in a large decrease in the observed effect. Such observations support the concept of a unique active site conformation for the transition state complex which requires the binding of all the components of the reaction. To assign the INDOR peak at 2.6 ppm, creatine kinase which had been selectively dansylated at the essential lysyl residues was investigated. It was established by water proton relaxation rate measurements of Mn(II) complexes that the dissociation constants for ADP and creatine binding to the enzyme are not significantly altered by dansylation, although there were changes in the enhancement factors of the Mn(II) complexes. Formate peak intensity measurements indicated little, if any, NOE for complexes with the dansylated enzyme. On the basis of the chemical shift of the formate INDOR peak, lack of an NOE for the quaternary complex of dansylated creatine kinase, and previous data showing loss of enzymatic activity upon dansylation of a single lysyl residue per active site, it is proposed that the e-CH2 protons of the lysyl residue at the active site are responsible for the formate NOE. Consequently, it is inferred that the role of the lysyl residue is to bind the transferable phosphoryl group. The interaction serves to provide the proper orientation for the transfer, and the electron-withdrawing properties of the lysyl e-NH3+ group facilitate nucleophilic attack at the phosphorus by the creatine guanidino group."

https://openalex.org/W2030854699,"In adult cyclic female rats, intravenous injections of an antiserum to testosterone prevented the continued increase in serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) which normally occurs during the early morning hours of estrus. This treatment did not prevent the initial increases in serum FSH (and luteinizing hormone) which occur during the critical period (1400 to 2000 of proestrus), nor did it interfere with subsequent ovulation. These observations indicate the existence of two separate mechanisms for preovulatory FSH release in the rat and implicate circulating testosterone as the stimulus for continued secretion of FSH during estrus."
https://openalex.org/W1557324813,"Abstract The kinetic behavior of rhodanese (thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase, EC 2.8.1.1) was investigated at pH values from 5.0 to 10.8. The binding of thiosulfate was shown to be dependent upon a pK' of 9.9, with the protonated enzyme binding the substrate much more strongly than the deprotonated form. An enzymic nucleophile displaces sulfite to form the sulfur-substituted enzyme. This reaction was shown to be dependent upon a pK' of 6.5, with the protonated form being unreactive. The sulfur-substituted enzyme has three forms which are related by pK' values of 5.9 and 9.4. The second order rate constants for the reaction of these enzymic forms with cyanide ion are 8.9 x 108 m-1 s-1, 2 x 107 m-1, s-1, and ≤104 m-1 s-1, as one goes from the most protonated to the least protonated form. The activation parameters for this reaction were studied at pH 8.7. The activation enthalpy was very small while the activation entropy was large and negative, probably indicating that there is only a transition state between the sulfur-substituted enzyme and the products and that the transition state involves considerable charge neutralization. The free enzyme and the sulfur-substituted enzyme are known to bind numerous anionic species, including substrates, which inhibit the reaction. The pH dependence of this inhibition indicated the importance of the same enzymic forms as the studies of the catalyzed reaction itself. This formal mechanism, combined with previous results, suggests a chemical interpretation on the following basis. (a) The enzyme contains a divalent cationic site which has at least one catalytically active water ligand. (b) Thiosulfate binding displaces one water ligand; the loss of a proton from this water ligand prevents both thiosulfate binding and the reaction with cyanide anion. (c) The enzymic nucleophile which displaces sulfite is a cysteine mercaptolate anion that is inactivated by protonation; this sulfhydryl may be either a direct ligand to the cationic site or hydrogen bonded to it, possibly through a second water ligand. (d) The sulfur-substituted enzyme has the cysteine persulfide structure as a ligand with the cationic site and this rapidly reacts with an outer sphere complex that the cationic site forms with cyanide. (e) Inhibitory anions displace a water ligand at the cationic site and decrease the enzyme-substrate interaction by mechanisms similar to those of the high pH ionizations of the free enzyme and the sulfur-substituted enzyme. The proposed chemical mechanism is consistent both with the results presented here and with the previous information concerning the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1564063238,"Abstract Of the four deoxyribonucleases, DNases A, B, C, and D, observable by chromatography of preparations of the pancreatic enzyme on cellulose phosphate, DNase D, the component present in the smallest amount, has not been previously characterized. Peptide maps show that the sequence of the amino acid residues in the polypeptide chain of DNase D is indistinguishable from that of DNase C; analysis of the carbohydrate side chain shows that DNase D contains 1 galactose and 1 sialic acid residue not present in DNase C. With the knowledge that DNase C differs from DNase A by the substitution of 1 proline for 1 histidine residue in the sequence, and that DNase B differs from DNase A only in that it is a sialoglycoprotein, we now see that the bovine pancreas synthesizes each of two amino acid sequences with and without the addition of galactose and sialic acid to the carbohydrate side chain. In order to prepare small amounts of DNase D in stable form, traces of proteolytic activity in the samples were removed by taking advantage of the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+. On DEAE-celluloses at pH 8.0, the DNases are strongly adsorbed and can be eluted relatively specifically by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in the eluting buffer (gradient from 0 to 2 mm Ca2+). This method of purification is applicable to DNases A, B, C, and D and provides further evidence of the marked effect of Ca2+ on the properties of these enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1494205083,"Abstract The Mo-Fe protein from bacteroids of soybean nodules has been purified to a high degree of homogeneity as judged by disc gel electrophoresis and ultracentrifugal analysis. The purification procedure included: polypropylene glycol fractionation, heat treatment, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-200. Specific activities of several preparations of the purified protein ranged between 850 and 1,000 for C2H2 and 260 and 300 for N2. When the Mo-Fe protein was assayed with an optimum level of iron protein, an apparent Km for N2 of 0.068 atm was obtained. The time for 50% inactivation of the protein under 0.2 atm of O2 at 30° is 4.5 min. A molecular weight of 197,600 for the protein was determined by low speed sedimentation equilibrium experiments and a molecular weight of 202,000 was determined by the high speed sedimentation equilibrium method. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of the protein in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride indicated one size of subunit with a molecular weight of about 50,000. Treatment of the protein with 2-mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate followed by electrophoresis in gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate also produced one size of subunit. A v of 0.732 ml per g was calculated from the amino acid composition and ultracentrifugal analysis revealed a s020, w value of 9.99. The ultraviolet spectrum of the protein exhibited an absorbance maximum at 279 nm and a molar extinction coefficient at this wave length of 3.69 x 105 cm-1 m-1. A broad general absorbance was observed in the visible spectrum between 350 and 600 nm and no obvious shoulders or peaks were apparent. Analyses of samples of the protein revealed a mean of 1.3 molybdenum, 28.8 iron, and 26.2 acid-labile sulfide atoms per molecule. All the common amino acids were present."
https://openalex.org/W181861798,"Abstract A large scale procedure for preparing plasma membranes from calf thymocytes has been devised. Kilogram quantities of frozen calf thymus were shredded in a high speed, motordriven vegetable shredder, followed by brief homogenization of the shredded tissue in 4 volumes of buffered 0.25 m sucrose using a Waring Blendor. The homogenate was subjected to differential centrifugation to remove nuclei and mitochondria and a crude membrane fraction was obtained which was subjected to centrifugation in a sucrose step gradient to yield a purified plasma membrane fraction. From each kilogram of calf thymus the procedure yielded 500 mg of purified thymocyte plasma membranes which were enriched 33-fold over the homogenate in 5'-nucleotidase activity (2.54 µm per hour per mg of protein) and 12-fold in sialic acid (36.8 nmoles per mg of protein). The membranes contained sialic acid, fucose, galactose, mannose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylgalactosamine in the ratio of 0.7:0.7:3.4:2.4:1.6:3.0:0.9. The purified membranes retained binding sites for all the phytohemagglutinins tested including those from kidney bean, lentil, mushroom, Ricinus communis, and also wheat germ agglutinin. The characteristics of the binding were very similar to those of intact calf thymocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1579460028,"Abstract Specific glycosphingolipid β-galactosidases in normal human liver were investigated using radioactively labeled galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, Gm1-ganglioside, and asialo Gm1-ganglioside as substrates. Chloride ion was required for full stimulation and stabilization of these reactions. Taurocholate was the most effective stimulator, except for Gm1-ganglioside β-galactosidase which did not appear to be affected by any of the detergents tested. Electrofocusing of the 10,000 x g supernatant of sonicated, frozen-thawed water homogenates gave three consistent peaks of nonspecific 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactosidase activities. Their isoelectric points were pH 4.1 to 4.2 (α), 4.5 to 4.6 (β), and 4.8 to 4.9 (γ). All of the three peaks contained activities of lactosylceramide and asialo Gm1-ganglioside β-galactosidases, but the activities of galactosylceramide and Gm1-ganglioside β-galactosidases were present only in the β and γ peaks. Gel filtration with Sephadex G-200 separated activities of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-galactosidase into three peaks. When each of the gel filtration peaks was subjected to electrofocusing, the second gel filtration peak corresponded to the β peak, and the third peak to the γ peak, respectively. The first gel filtration peak, however, gave inconsistent results in electrofocusing, always giving a single peak but with varying isoelectric points. The primary purpose of this study was to establish the optimal assay conditions for these enzymes in whole tissues and to obtain a reproducible fractionation procedure, without sacrificing the recovery of total activities. These were the criteria necessary for the subsequent studies of disorders in which specific glycosphingolipid β-galactosidases are genetically deficient."

https://openalex.org/W1596225324,"Abstract Two half-molecular weight subunits of 4'-phospho[14C]pantetheine-labeled pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase have been separated and shown to be nonidentical. An affinity chromatographic column containing e-aminocaproylpantetheine bound to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose via the e-amino group was used to achieve this separation. The subunit containing 4'-phospho[14C]pantetheine and β-ketoacyl thioester reductase activity is only slightly retarded on this column, whereas the subunit containing acetyl coenzyme A transacylase activity is strongly adsorbed. The latter sub-unit is eluted from the column with 0.1 m phosphate buffer at pH 10. Each subunit is then purified free of small amounts of the other subunit. This is accomplished by subjecting each to conditions which effect fatty acid synthetase formation. Subsequent sucrose density gradient centrifugation then separates the pure half-molecular weight subunits containing transacylase or β-ketoacyl thioester reductase activity from the small amount of fatty acid synthetase complex. Recombination of the purified subunits under appropriate conditions yields enzymatically active fatty acid synthetase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1505609531,"Abstract A calcium-binding protein from porcine intestinal mucosa has been characterized by a variety of physical and chemical techniques. Chromatography on Sephadex G-75 suggests a molecular weight around 12,000, while electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea-polyacrylamide gel indicates a molecular weight in the region of 7000. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses give evidence for aggregation, with the monomeric form having a molecular weight between 7000 and 9000. The amino acid composition is as follows: Lys11–12, Arg1, Asp7, Thr1, Ser6–7, Glu17, Gly4, Ala5, Val3, Ile3, Leu10, Tyr1, Phe5. There is no histidine, half-cystine, methionine, or tryptophan. The composition requires a minimal molecular weight of 9000. No free terminal amino group was detectable, but digestion with penicillocarboxypeptidases S1 and S2 indicated the following COOH-terminal sequence: .... (Gly, Thr, Asp)Ala-Ile-Val(Phe, Ser)Leu-Lys-GlnOH. The circular dichroism spectrum of the binding protein in the near ultraviolet shows a positive peak at 276 nm with a shoulder at 282 nm characteristic of tyrosine, two positive peaks at 264 nm and 257 nm, and two negative peaks at 268 and 261 nm characteristic of phenylalanine. In the far ultraviolet range two negative bands at 222 nm and 207 nm are observed. Removal of calcium ions causes a marked decrease in the tyrosine band at 276 nm to less than 25% of its initial value, but no difference is observed in the far ultraviolet range. Ultraviolet difference spectra between the calcium-containing and the calcium-free protein show peaks characteristic of tyrosine. No difference in sedimentation rates was observed. It appears that the binding of calcium causes a local perturbance of the environment of the single tyrosine residue, but no gross conformational changes."

The absorption spectrum of the photoresponsive pigment, which shows a strong band at 430 nm and two broad low extinction bands in the 550- to 590-nm region, is consistent with the action spectrum of phototaxis. Thus, this pigment appears to be the photoreceptor pigment for phototaxis in pseudoplasmodia of D. discoideum."
https://openalex.org/W1510379044,"Abstract The spectrum of fatty acids produced by the fatty acid synthetase complex of Mycobacterium phlei under several conditions has been examined. The observed pattern is always bimodal, consisting of palmitate and tetracosanoate as the two principal products and of lesser amounts of myristate, stearate, arachidate, and behenate. However, the relative proportions of the shorter chain acids (C14 to C18) to longer chain acids (C20 to C24) can be varied over a wide range. Such alterations can occur either with or without changes in the over-all rate of synthesis. Raising the acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA ratio from 0.4 (8 µm acetyl-CoA) to 150 (3 mm acetyl-CoA) increases the percentage of shorter chain acids from 12% to 87%. The addition of mycobacterial 3-O-methylmannose containing polysaccharide (MMP) or 6-Omethylglucose containing polysaccharide (MGLP) at standard assay conditions (300 µm acetyl-CoA) causes a similar shift from a low (25%) to a high (85%) proportion of shorter chain acids, concurrent with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the rate of over-all synthesis. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) has the same effect on the fatty acid pattern as MMP or MGLP (70% shorter chain acids at 1 mg of BSA per ml) but does not stimulate over-all synthesis. The effect of free CoA depends on the concentration of both the coenzyme and of acetyl-CoA. At 50 µm acetyl-CoA and CoA concentrations up to 100 µm, the formation of short chain acids is favored, whereas at higher CoA concentrations there is a shift toward the longer (C20 to C24) acids. M. phlei palmitoyl thioesterase when added to the standard assay system (300 µm acetylCoA) roughly doubles the proportion of short chain acids but does not affect the over-all rate of synthesis. To account for the widely varying fatty acid patterns in response to experimental conditions, it is proposed that fatty acyl chains (C16 and C18) either enzyme bound or accumulating as free CoA derivatives regulate the over-all rate of synthesis, perhaps by feed-back inhibition. Reagents that lower the levels of free or enzyme bound C16-CoA (or C18-CoA) will therefore affect the synthetic rate, the product distribution or both. They may do so by competition (high concentrations of acetyl-CoA), by complexing acyl-CoA (MMP, MGLP and BSA), or by thioester hydrolysis (palmitoyl thioesterase). Explanations are offered for the ability of the polysaccharides and the failure of BSA to stimulate over-all synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1593607906,"Abstract The total lipid content of differentiating Dictyostelium discoideum was 100 to 125 mg per g dry weight; of this, about 95 mg per g was polar lipid (mainly phospholipid) and 25 mg per g was neutral lipid in the early stages. During culmination and maturation of the sorocarp, polar lipid declined to 75 mg per g, while neutral lipid increased to 40 mg per g. Per 1010 cells, polar lipid declined from 135 to 75 mg and neutral lipid increased from 33 to 45 mg. The neutral lipid fraction was resolved into its major components and the level of each in milligrams per g dry weight was determined at 10 different stages of slime mold differentiation. Stigmast-22-en-3β-ol remained near 10 to 11 during the early stages, rose to 15 at the beginning of migration, and then declined back to about 12; stigmastenol C16-C18 esters began a prolonged rise from 1 to 2 during early aggregation, ultimately reaching 15 in 3-day sorocarps; ubiquinone declined from 0.5 to 0.2 to 0.3 during aggregation where it remained until culmination, when it rose rapidly to a maximum of 1 to 2 in mature sorocarps; free fatty acids increased to a maximum of 7 during early aggregation and then fell sharply to less than 2 during migration; and triglycerides and diglycerides declined from initial levels of 2 to 4 to about 1 during the early stages. Approximate balances among the different lipid components were calculated from the changes in quantities. During the period prior to early aggregation, a net synthesis of lipid (phospholipid, sterol, and sterol ester) occurred from unidentified precursors. During aggregation metabolism shifted toward a net degradation, characterized by a rapid conversion of free fatty acids to unidentified products. This net degradation continued during the migration-preculmination period, although phospholipid replaced the nearly exhausted triglyceride and free fatty acid reserves as the major source of lipid. During the later periods net sterol synthesis ceased, but sterol ester synthesis continued at the expense of preformed free sterol."

https://openalex.org/W1533455389,"Abstract Choline acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.6) catalyzes the reversible transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to choline. Previous studies are consistent with the idea that an active site sulfhydryl group reacts with acetyl coenzyme A to form an acetyl-thioenzyme intermediate and coenzyme A (Roskoski, R., Jr. (1973) Biochemistry 12, 3709). Choline then reacts with the acetyl-enzyme to form acetylcholine and the regenerated enzyme. It has been found that the enzyme is inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide with a second order rate constant of 32.5 m-1 s-1 at pH 7.4 at 37°. The enzyme is completely protected against N-ethylmaleimide inactivation by acetyl coenzyme A and is substantially protected by acetylcholine. Choline does not appreciably protect against thiol reagent inactivation. The postulated acetyl-enzyme intermediate, isolated by Sephadex gel filtration, is also resistant to thiol reagent inactivation, but becomes susceptible to inactivation as the acetyl group is transfered from enzyme to substrate. At saturating concentrations of acetyl coenzyme A and choline (during turnover), the enzyme is resistant to inactivation. Decreasing the acetyl coenzyme A concentration during turnover renders the enzyme susceptible to N-ethylmaleimide inactivation. These studies provide further evidence for an active site—SH and for a kinetically significant acetyl-thioenzyme intermediate. The results also suggest that the reaction of choline with the acetylenzyme (deacylation) is rate-limiting during turnover."

Enzyme assays were based on the release of radioactively labeled acetate from the substrates. The large fragment (residues 1 to 84) derived by CNBr treatment and the NH2-terminal sequence (residues 1 to 37) prepared by chymotryptic digestion were both active as substrates for the deacetylase. The enzyme failed to remove acetyl groups from a smaller synthetic peptide (residues 15 to 21) encompassing the major site of acetylation at Lys16."
https://openalex.org/W1508764351,"Abstract The nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerases have been partially purified from the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. Two major forms of the enzyme are readily separated upon phosphocellulose chromatography. One of these (R) is resistant to the mushroom toxin α-amanitin, has a low salt optimum, and has a relatively low preference for denatured DNA over native DNA. This enzyme is therefore probably identifiable with RNA polymerase I from the higher eukaryotes. The other enzyme (S) is sensitive to α-amanitin, has a relatively high salt optimum, and has a relatively high preference for denatured DNA over native DNA. This enzyme is apparently analogous to RNA polymerase II from the higher eukaryotes. Slime mold RNA polymerase R has been purified to near homogeneity. This enzyme has a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 13.1 S. Polyacrylamide gels run under denaturing conditions reveal a probable subunit structure as follows: 200,0001; 135,0001; 45,0001; 24,0002; 17,0001."
https://openalex.org/W1520515885,"Abstract Cobalamin binding to hog intrinsic factor has been studied by affinity chromatography, and the cobalt atom of the cobalamin tested was found to be no more than 5 A from the surface of the protein. A comparative study of the binding of the c carboxylic acid derivative versus the c amide at C7 of the B-pyrrole ring indicates that a change in charge at this position of the corrin ring has little effect on complex formation with intrinsic factor. Furthermore, the coordination sphere in the region of 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole must be extremely hydrophobic because CNθ will not displace this base from the cobalt atom when cobalamin is bound to intrinsic factor."

A., Spicer, D. S., and Brahinsky, R. A. (1948) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 70, 3034–3040). All three have identical amino acid compositions, except that isoinhibitor A has six free carboxyl groups, B 7, and C 8. The location of the missing amide groups has not been determined. Each of the three isoinhibitors was virgin, with the reactive site bond intact. The modified form of each isoinhibitor with the Arg 18-Ile 19 bond cleaved has been prepared and found active, confirming and extending previous reports. The reversibility of the modification step was shown for each of the three isoinhibitors. The pathway leading to the inactive forms starting with the modified form is the major, but not the only pathway. Part of the isoinhibitor A is first hydrolyzed at Arg 5-Glu 6. This form is active and susceptible to the modifying cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W1482753106,Abstract The interaction of indole and skatole with lecithin micelles has been examined in three apolar solvents using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 60 MHz. Interactions lead to large chemical shift changes in resonances of both the indoles and the phospholipid. Shifts of the lecithin —N(CH3)3 resonance of 80 Hz to high field and shifts of indole amine protons of over 100 Hz to low field have been observed. The former shifts are attributed to aromatic shielding by the indoles while the latter are presumably caused by hydrogen bonding to lecithin phosphates. Binding constants of 11.6 m-1 for skatole and 50.1 m-1 for indole have been calculated from the proton spectra. The methylene protons of the lecithin fatty acids and the aromatic resonances of the indoles are markedly affected by indole-lecithin interactions. It is also apparent that the indoles hinder mobility of water at the polar head of the micelles. None of the above spectral changes are observed with 1-methylindole and it is assumed that hydrogen bonding of the indole amine hydrogen to the phosphate is necessary for indole compounds and lecithin interaction. These results are consistent with the model that skatole and indole intercalate between the lecithin fatty acid chains near the polar head. The amine proton of the indole ring is hydrogen bonded with the phosphate and the —N(CH3)3 moves closer to the indole ring. Water mobility is reduced around the polar head.

This enzyme is not cold-labile and can be stored at 4° with little loss in enzyme activity for up to 2 weeks in 0.25 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 1.0 mm dithiothreitol in an atmosphere of N2. At room temperature the activity was lost in 3 days. In Tris (10mm)-glycine (35 mm) buffer, pH 8.45, the enzyme dissociated completely in about 27 hours into obviously nonidentical, but inseparable 9 S subunits with molecular weights of 220,000 with a loss of most of the fatty acid synthetase and crotonyl-CoA reductase activities. On filtration of these subunits through Sephadex G-50, equilibrated with 0.25 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10-3 m dithiothreitol, they reassociated with partial recovery of both fatty acid synthetic and crotonyl-CoA reductase activities. Prolonged dialysis of the enzyme against Tris buffer resulted in the loss of both activities completely. The ressociation, as judged by the recovery of the two activities of the enzyme, then took 14 to 19 days to be accomplished. The various size-shape parameters are consistent with a model in which the two half-molecular rod-shaped subcomplexes are held together in the native enzyme complex head to head with the catalytic sites of all the constitutive enzymes of the complex juxtaposed near each other. The crotonyl-CoA reductase activity is also believed to occur at a nearby site as the structural integrity of the native enzyme complex is essential for this activity also."

Solutions of the relevant transport equations predict the shape and movement of solute zones for such systems. An experimental investigation of one such system has been carried out: the reversible unfolding of hen egg lysozyme. Results of this study clearly illustrate the effects of finite reaction kinetics on the shapes of solute profiles. To elucidate the influence of chromatographic parameters on the solute profiles, numerical simulations have also been carried out based on the theoretical expressions derived. From these investigations some guidelines have been formulated to aid the design of optimal chromatographic systems for study of isomerizing proteins. In general the technique is best applied to systems with rate constants less than 3 hour-1."

When adipocytes were prepared in galactose-containing buffer, they incorporated significantly more 14C from [U-14C]glucose into CO2, total lipids, glyceride-glycerol, and fatty acids than cells prepared using glucose-containing buffer. When isolated adipocytes were prepared in either glucose-containing or galactose-containing buffer solutions and incubated with galactose plus glucose, the incorporation of [1-14C]galactose into CO2, total lipids, and glyceride-glycerol was significantly greater in the latter group than in the former. Adipocytes prepared with galactose-containing buffer consumed significantly more oxygen than adipocytes prepared with glucose-containing buffer. These results suggest that galactose enhances glucose uptake and metabolism by adipocytes, the metabolism of which was accelerated probably through a change in the oxidation-reduction state of the cells. It was also suggested that exogenous galactose from milk might have some physiological significance in sucklings."
