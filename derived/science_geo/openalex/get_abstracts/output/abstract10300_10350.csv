https://openalex.org/W2095006894,"Incubation of histidine requiring auxotrophs of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium with malonaldehyde, a three-carbon dialdehyde, produced an increased number of revertants in specific strains. Mutagenesis was only observed in frameshift mutants with normal excision repair and did not occur in those base-pair substitution mutants tested. The results are consistent with the cross-linking of bacterial DNA by malonaldehyde leading to mutagenesis expressed through the error-prone repair system."

https://openalex.org/W1503602480,"Sixty-seven ribosomal proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been distinguished by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Five of the ribosomal proteins are phosphorylated in vivo. One of the phosphorylated proteins appears to correspond to the phosphorylated ribosomal protein, S6, of rat liver. Another of the yeast-phosphorylated proteins, which is highly acidic, may be related to the protein L7/L12 of Escherichia coli. The phosphorylation of four of the five ribosomal proteins depends on protein synthesis. Ribosome synthesis, however, is not necessary for the phosphorylation of any of them. Three proteins of the 60 S ribosomal subunit are in vivo. Two of these are phosphoproteins, one of which is the very acidic protein possibly related to L7/L12 of E. coli. The possible significance of this phosphorylated, exchangeable protein in protein synthesis is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1590995017,"Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase is an allosteric enzyme consisting of two nonidentical subunits, proteins B1 and B2. B1 contains dithiols which participate in the oxidation-reduction reactions of electron transport, while B2 contains a free radical essential for activity. Ribonucleoside diphosphates are bound to B1 but not to B2. Addition of 2'-deoxy-2'-chloro ribonucleoside diphosphates to ribonucleotide reductase irreversibly inactivates B1 without affecting B2. The reaction is specific since (a) it requires the presence of active B2, (b) it is controlled by allosteric effectors, (c) B1 is protected against inactivation by the normal substrates, and (d) the chloro-substituted nucleoside monophosphates have no effect. The inactivation of B1 is caused by a modification of the oxidation-reduction dithiols. The chloro derivatives decompose into free base, chloride ion, and 2-deoxyribose 5-diphosphate as a consequence of reaction with the enzyme. 2'-Deoxy-2-azido ribonucleoside diphosphates cause an irreversible inactivation of B2 without affecting B1. The reaction is specific by the above criteria, indicating that the azido derivatives also bind to the active site of the enzyme. On reduction by ribonucleotide reductase, the azido derivatives function as radical scavengers and selectively destroy the free radical of B2, indicating that this radical participates in ribonucleotide reduction directly. On the basis of these results, a model of the active site of ribonucleotide reductase is proposed in which the site is formed from both B1 and B2. In the site the electron-donating oxidation-reduction active dithiols of B1 are in close contact with the free radical of B2. The azido derivative also inactivates the adenosylcobalamin-dependent ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase from Lactobacillus leichmannii and a ribonucleotide reductase preparation from calf thymus, indicating a general involvement of free radical intermediates in enzyme-catalyzed ribonucleotide reduction."

https://openalex.org/W1502003464,"The subunits of yeast RNA polymerases A(I) and B(II) were characterized using several techniques. The present studies demonstrate that the A and B enzymes possess three subunits, which are indistinguishable on the basis of molecular weight, isoelectric point, and fingerprint pattern. The three common subunits belong to the small molecular weight components of the enzymes. By polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate they migrate with apparent molecular weights of 27,000, 23,000, and 14,500, respectively. A two-dimensional subunit mapping technique on polyacrylamide gel was used to separate the subunits according to isoelectric point and molecular weight. The common polypeptides co-migrated on three spots corresponding to isoelectric points of 9.2 (27,000), 4.5 (23,000), and 4.6 (14,500). The fingerprints of the 35S-labeled tryptic peptides of the presumptive common subunits were found to be essentially identical. Finally, the presence of common subunits was supported by the fact that antibodies against pure RNA polymerase A cross-react with and inhibit RNA polymerase B. Except for the common subunits, it is likely that RNA polymerases A and B are primarily made of distinct gene products for the following reasons. A total of 13 polypeptide chains are present in enzyme A, whereas 10 polypeptides are found in enzyme B. The molecular weight, isoelectric point, and sulfur content of the majority of these polypeptide chains are different in the two enzymes. No similarity was found in the 35S-peptide fingerprint from a number of A and B subunits of slightly different molecular weight. Finally, antibodies against the largest subunit from RNA polymerase A do not cross-react with or inhibit RNA polymerase B. The data are discussed in terms of structural organization of eukaryotic RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1564079999,"With the ultimate objective of the total synthesis of a tRNA gene including its transcriptional signals, an Escherichia coli tyrosine suppressor tRNA gene was chosen. The arguments in favor of this choice are presented. A plan for the total synthesis of the 126-nucleotide-long DNA duplex corresponding to a precursor (Altman S., and Smith, J. D. (1971) Nature New Biol. 233, 35) to the above tRNA is formulated. The plan involves: (a) the chemical synthesis of 26 deoxyribooligonucleotide segments, (b) polynucleotide ligase-catalyzed joining of several segments at a time to form a total of four DNA duplexes with appropriate comlementary single-stranded ends, and (c) the joining of the duplexes to form the entire DNA duplex. Ten accompanying papers describe the experimental realization of this objective."

https://openalex.org/W2110194049,"The uptake of various carbohydrates and the synthesis of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) are subject to inhibition by sugar substrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli. The induced synthesis of the sugar-specific components of the phosphotransferase system was studied and correlated with the induction of regulatory interactions controlling glycerol uptake and net cyclic AMP synthesis. Activities of the Enzyme II complexes specific for glucose, fructose, and mannitol were measured both in vivo and in vitro. These activities were induced 8- to 40-fold by growth in the presence of the appropriate substrate-inducers. Cross inducer specificities were noted. Maximal inhibition of glycerol uptake and cyclic AMP synthesis by a sugar substrate of the phosphotransferase system required induction of the Enzyme II complex specific for that sugar and was abolished by mutations which destroyed Enzyme II activity. The inducer specificities of the regulatory systems and of the Enzymes II were found to be the same. A mutation which depressed the cellular activity of Enzyme I of the phosphotransferase system did not relieve sensitivity to inhibition. The results suggest that adenylate cyclase and several carbohydrate permeases are subject to coordinate regulation by a mechanism which depends on the catalytic activities of the protein components of the phosphotransferase system."
https://openalex.org/W1578661099,"The maganese-containing superoxide dismutase, from Escherichia coli, lost metal and activity when dialyzed against 20 mM-8-hydroxyquinoline and 2.5 M guanidinium chloride in 5 mM Tris-chloride buffer at pH 7.8. Subsequent dialysis against 0.01 m M McCl2, in this buffer, caused a restoration of manganese and activity. Reconstituted enzyme appeared identical with native enzyme, and removal and restoration of manganese could be repeated. Co (II), Zn(II), Ni(II), Mg(II), Cr (II), Cu(II), Fe(II), In(II), and Mo(VI), were tested for their abiltiy to replace manganese. None of these restored activity to apoenzyme. When present at a 100-fold molar excess over manganese only Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II) were effective as competitors of manganese. Co(II) was demonstrated to be tightly bound to the apoenzyme in place of the magnasese, with a stoichiometry of 1 Co(II) per molecule. In the cases of Co(II), Zn(II), or Ni(II), reconstituted enzyme; the metals could be removed and subsequently replaced by manganese, with restoration of catalytic activity. None of these metal cations exhibited superoxide dismutase activity. We conclude that manganese is essential for the catalytic activity of superoxide dismutase, and that the site which normally binds manganese can accommodate Co(II), Ni(II), and Zn(II)."

These precursors range from 135 to 690 nucleotides in length. Their tRNA content has been determined by digestion of the precursors to 4 S RNA, followed by Sanger fingerprint analysis of the purified 4 S material. Identification of some of these tRNAs, as well as an estimate of the number of copies of tRNA in each precursor has been achieved. Many of these precursor RNA molecules contain multiple copies of the same tRNA sequence, indicating a tandem arrangement of the corresponding tRNA genes in the E. coli genome."

https://openalex.org/W2126735232,"A procedure has been developed for the rapid purification of large amounts of yeast RNA polymerase I (A). The method involves batchwise treatment with phosphocellulose and DEAE-cellulose, ion filtration chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and DNA-cellulose chromatography. The enzyme obtained is apparently homogeneous by sedimentation velocity analysis and has a specific activity of 300 nmol of UMP incorporated into RNA in 10 min per mg of protein. Between 30 and 45 mg of enzyme can be obtained in 5 days from 3.0 kg of yeast cells. The subunit composition of the enzyme was determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The purified polymerase is composed of 11 putative subunits with molecular weights 185,000 (Ia), 137,000 (Ib), 48,000 (Ic), 44,000 (Id), 41,000 (Ie), 36,000 (If), 28,000 (Ig), 24,000 (Ih), 20,000 (Ii), 14,500 (Ij), and 12,000 (Ik). Yeast polymerase I separates into two forms when subjected to gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions. The main component which migrates faster contains all the subunits except the polypeptides Ic and If. The slow migrating component which is present in lower amounts contains all the subunits."

At the elevated temperature, the latter two strains continue to grow but suffer a partial deprivation of valyl-tRNA. As a consequence, the syntheses of stable RNA, Tu, and G are decreased in NF536; the syntheses of stable RNA, Tu, and G are increased in NF537. These results indicate that the syntheses of Tu and G are directly or indirectly under the influence of the rel gene."
https://openalex.org/W1964459868,"WHILE undertaking another experiment, we discovered a surprising and dramatic visual phenomenon. We were observing two gratings of high contrast and different spatial frequency (see Fig. 1 inset) while both gratings were rotating at a rate of 1 revolution per min. Both gratings were easily visible at the viewing distances used. The coarse grating was seen to revolve as expected; however, the fine grating appeared to revolve very slowly. This phenomenon has been shown to over 100 people1 and all were startled by the observation. The individual reaction was to assert that the two gratings must be rotating at different physical speeds. This disbelief was readily corrected by removing the two gratings from their turntables and replacing each of them in the position of the other. Another entertaining variation of the observation is to observe the fine grating at the distance where it is perceived as a uniform disk; naturally, no movement can be seen at this distance. If one now advances slowly towards the grating it is initially seen as stationary; as one approaches closer it is seen to rotate progressively faster. At a particular distance it seems to rotate faster than the coarse grating. We have quantified these causal observations and show here that the perception of slow rotation movement is related to the spatial frequency and contrast of the pattern which is rotated."

https://openalex.org/W1529544307,"The interaction of Pseudomanas putida anthranilate synthetase Component II (AS II) with glutamine, glutamine analogs, and iodoacetamide has been investigated in order to clarify the initial steps in the mechanism for glutamine utilization. AS II is alkylated and irreversibly inactivated by covalent attachment of approximately 1 eg of L-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone) or 1 eq of iodoacetamide. Alkylation of AS II by chloroketone involves initial formation of an enzyme-inhibitor complex having a Ki of 28 muM. Alkylation of AS II by iodoacetamide occurs without initial formation of a reversible complex. In both cases glutamine protects against alkylation and exhibits competitive kinetics. When anthranilate synthetase Component I (AS I) is associated with AS II, the second substrate, chorismate, enhances alkylation of AS II by chloroketone. Alkylation of AS II by iodoacetamide is unaffected by AS I and chorismate. These results suggest a role of chorismate-AS I complex to promote binding of glutamine to AS II or to facilitate conversion of an AS II-glutamine complex to the covalent glutamyl-AS II intermediate. This conclusion is supported by the fact that glutaminase activity of AS II, which requires formation of the glutamyl-AS II intermediate, is stimulated by AS I and chorismate."
https://openalex.org/W1516830143,"Polynucleotide ligase-catalyzed joining of the eight chemically synthesized deoxyribopolynucleotide segments (Fig. 1) comprising the nucleotide sequence 23-66 of the DNA corresponding to the Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA precursor has been systematically investigated. Joining was studied using all possible combinations of 3, 4, and 5 and larger numbers of segments at a time. The extent of joining varied widely (0 to about 90%) in three component systems. The ""self-structure"" of some of the components evidently inhibited the joining. Addition of a fourth segment in general enhanced the extent of joining and optimal yields were obtained in systems containing six or more segments. A comparison of the T4-induced ligase and the E. coli polynucleotide ligase for joining of the chemically synthesized segments showed the E. coli enzyme to be inferior to the T4-induced ligase. Satisfactory syntheses of the duplexes [IIa] and [IIb] comprising, respectively, eight and seven segments were achieved in single steps. Of the two terminal segments carrying 5'-OH groups in the duplexes, only one (segment 7) was used in the prephosphorylated form. The duplexes were isolated pure and characterized by enzymatic degradations and by electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1544703694,"Abstract A conformational difference between the structure of tRNAPhe and Cbz-Phe-tRNAPhe from Escherichia coli was detected using the spin label method. A comparison of the respective rotational correlation time (tau c) values of three differently located spin labels, indicates that upon aminoacylation of tRNAPhe, the 4-thiouridine residue region and the miniloop region become more flexible, while the environment of the anticodon loop is not affected. These observations suggest that the main difference in structure between charged and uncharged tRNA resides in the release and exposure of the TpsiC loop for eventual binding to the ribosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1569885142,"Using the single-stranded circular DNA of bacteriophage fd as template, double-stranded circular DNA has been prepared in vitro with either 5-hydroxymethylcytosine ([hmdC]DNA) or cytosine ([dC]DNA) in the product strand. Extracts prepared from Escherichia coli cells restrictive to T-even phage containing nonglucosylated DNA degrade [hmdC]DNA to acid-soluble material in vitro, but do not degrade [dC]dna. In contrast, extracts prepared from E. coli K12 rglA- rglB-, a strain permissive to T-even phage containing nonglucosylated DNA, do not degrade [hmdC]DNA or [dC]DNA. In addition, glucosylation of the [hmdC]DNA renders it resistant to degradation by extracts from restrictive strains. The conversion of [hmdC]DNA to acid-soluble material in vitro consists of an HmCyt-specific endonucleolytic cleavage requiring the presence of the RglB gene product to form a linear molecule, followed by a non-HmCyt-specific hydrolysis of the linear DNA to acid-soluble fragments, catalyzed in part by exonuclease V. The RglB protein present in extracts of E. coli K12 rglA- rglB+ has been purified 200-fold by complementation with extracts from E. coli K12 rglA- rglB-. The purified RglB protein does not contain detectable HmCyt-specific endonuclease or exonuclease activity. In vitro endonucleolytic cleavage of [hmdC]DNA thus requires additional factors present in cell extracts."
https://openalex.org/W1482444938,"We have prepared homogeneous radiolabeled Escherichia coli Elongation Factor G (EF-G) and examined its interactions with the ribosome. In agreement with earlier indirect observations we found that in the presence of high concentrations of fusidic acid approximately equimolar amounts of [3H]EF-G and [alpha-32P]GDP are stably bound to the ribosome. In the absence of fusidic acid, we observed a previously undescribed nucleotide-independent binding interaction between EF-G and the ribosome. This binding is detectable by rapid elution on small gel columns but is not apparent when reactions are analyzed by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. With the exception of the fact that the nucleotide-independent binding of EF-G to ribosome is apparently unaffected even by high concentrations of fusidic acid, it shares many properties in common with that binding which occurs in the presence of GDP. Nucleotide-independent binding requires magnesium ion (10 to 20 mM ) and does not require a monovalent cation but is strongly inhibited by even moderate concentrations of NH4Cl. This binding requires the presence on the ribosome of Protein L7/L12 and is inhibited by the antibiotic thiostrepton. Although we were unable to examine the binary ribosome.EF-G complex by equilibrium means, the observed stoichiometry under the conditions we employed did not exceed 0.2 mol of EF-G/mole of ribosome. Nonequilibrium measurements revealed that one-half of the EF-G was bound at a ribosome concentration of about 50 muM."
https://openalex.org/W1645813498,"To quantitate the amount of GTP hydrolyzed during polypeptide chain elongation, an in vitro system containing purified endogenous Escherichia coli polysomes has been developed. The polysomes are washed with 1 M NH4Cl to eliminate endogenous GTPase activities and are depleted of subunits and free ribosomes to diminish the uncoupled elongation factor G-dependent GTP hydrolysis. These polysomes, supplemented with elongation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA, and low concentrations of GTP, incorporate amino acids in their nascent peptide chains. After correcting for a background of uncoupled GTP hydrolysis, it has been found that the incorporation of each molecule of amino acid is associated with the hydrolysis of 2 molecules of GTP."

Synthesis of the guanine-rich undecanucleotide d(G-G-T-G-G-G-G-T-T-C-C) was performed by the use of a new protecting group for the guanine ring, the methylbutyryl group. The heptanucleotide d[(MeOTr)mbG-mbG-T-mbG-mbG-mbG-mbG], prepared by the new method, was condensed with the tetranucleotide d[panC-anC-T-T(Ac)]. All of the condensations described followed previously developed chemical principles and started with the N- and 5'-protected deoxyribonucleosides.

https://openalex.org/W94247581,"The kinetics of binding of the inducer, isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactoside to lactose repressor from Escherichia coli was studied by stopped flow rapid mixing techniques. Three different spectral probes for measuring changes in the conformation of the repressor were used: ultraviolet absorbance, fluorescence, and a reporter group, 2-mercuri-4-nitrophenol, in the visible region. Repressor can be reacted with this mercurial to modify two of the three free sulfhydryl groups per monomer without loss of inducer or operator binding activities. The observed first order rate constant for the reaction of repressor with 2-chloromercuri-4-nitrophenol at pH 7.5 and 20 degrees was found to be on the order of 0.1 s-1, an unexpectedly slow rate for this type of reaction. Once bound to repressor, the nitrophenol serves as a chromophoric probe to monitor changes in the surrounding environment. The binding of inducer to repressor causes a change in the absorbance of the bound 2-mercuri-4-nitrophenol moiety and exhibits a second order rate of 3.2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1. Similar rates were obtained when binding of inducer is monitored by changes in either the ultraviolet absorbance of fluorescence of tryptophan residues. Since the same rate of spectral perturbation is observed for different regions of the primary structure of the protein, the conformational change produced in response to inducer binding appears to be translated rapidly throughout the protein molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1566105448,"Escherichia coli Elongation Factor G is inhibited ireversibly by the chemical modification of 1 cysteine residue with N-ethylmaleimide. At pH 5.2, this cysteine is approximately 130 times more reactive than beta-mercaptoethanol toward N-ethylmaleimide. Inhibition is not prevented by either the ribosome or GTP alone at concentrations approximately equal to that of Elongation Factor G, but in combination they reduce the inhibition by 50%. Increasing the stability of the Elongation Factor G-ribosome-GDP complex by the addition of fusidec acid, completely protects against N-ethylmaleimide inhibition. The modified protein cannot form either the Elongation Factor G-ribosome-GMP-P(CH2)P or the Elongation Factor G-ribosome-GDP-fusidic acidcomplex. However, the modification had no effect on its ability to form the Elongation Factor G-ribosome complex. These results suggest that the cysteine residue modified by N-ethylmaleimide is at or near the nucleotide binding site."

Chemical syntheses used protected mono- and oligonucleotides and stepwise condensation methods. The detailed plans used are given in Diagrams 1 to 4 in the text. Two additional notable features in the present syntheses were: (a) solvent extraction procedures for the preparation of oligonucleotides as large as pentanucleotides and (b) the demonstration that a heptanucleotide containing 5'-phosphate group can be used successfully in condensation with the 3'-OH group of another oligonucleotide.

https://openalex.org/W1491370032,"The DNA duplexes representing nucleotide sequences 61-89 and 57-94 have been synthesized, isolated pure, and fully characterized. Synthesis of the duplex with the nucleotide sequence 61-89 involved the DNA ligase-catalyzed joining of chemically synthesized deoxyoligonucleotide segments 14 to 18 shown in Fig. 1A, while for the longer duplex (sequences 57-94) seven deoxyribooligonucleotides (segments 13 to 19, Fig. 1B) were used in one-step enzymatic joining. The joining of the short tetranucleotide (segment 16) to the segment 17 required the presence of the adjacent segment 14, even if the latter did not contain a 5'-phosphate group, to allow its joining to segment 16. However, in the synthesis of both of the DNA duplexes, the yields were comparatively low (30 to 40%) and could not be significantly increased although a variety of conditions was tried. The main cause in both cases evidently was the sluggish joining of segment 14 to 16 and of segment 16 to segment 17. Although the original plan for the total synthesis of this part of the gene for the tRNA precursor involved the DNA duplex consisting of segments 14 to 18, this duplex could not be quantitatively phosphorylated at the two 5'-OH ends for subsequent joining to the adjoining parts of the gene. The DNA duplex consisting of segments 13 to 19, which possesses both terminal 5'-OH groups at protruding single-stranded ends, was readily phosphorylated and used successfully in the total synthesis of the gene as described in an accompanying paper."
https://openalex.org/W1596318991,"Lysine-requiring mutants of Bacillus sphaericus 9602 were isolated and classified into three groups by their mutation site in the pathway of lysine biosynthesis. The Group I mutant lacks meso-alpha, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid (meso-Dap) decarboxylase activity, but Group II and III mutants have a normal level of Dap decarboxylase activity. A Group II mutant makes dipicolinic acid from an intermediate in the lysine pathway, but Group III mutants do not. In the absence of meso-Dap in the culture, muramic lactam content in the spore cortex of Group II and III mutants is very low, compared to the wild type content. Addition of meso-Dap to the culture causes an increase of muramic lactam content. Since meso-Dap is detectable only in the spore cortex of B. sphaericus 9602, almost all of the muramic lactam in the spore is probably also located in the cortex. Group I mutants grown in the presence of L-lysine sporulate normally. Group II and III mutants produce oval and nonrefractile spores under the same conditions but the addition of meso-Dap to the culture results in the production of round and refractile spores. Thus, the presence of cortex in the spore is essential to give the round and refractile spores in B. sphaericus. The presence of cortex is also required for the accumulation of dipicolinic acid in the sporulating cells. Furthermore, 1-octanol resistance of the spore depends only on the presence of cortex but both cortex and dipicolinic acid are required for heat resistance of the spore."

https://openalex.org/W1601277041,"The kinetics of initiation of in vitro RNA synthesis by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase on the chromatin template of chick oviduct was examined and compared to initiation on the template of deproteinized chick DNA. The formation of rapidly starting, highly stable binary complexes (RS complexes) between RNA polymerase and chromatin was an apparent first order process with a half-time (t1/2) of 9.4 min. By contrast, the t1/2 of formation of RS complex on chick DNA was 1.3 min. The apparent first order rate constants of RNA chain initiation from performed RS complexes were 0.57 s-1 for chromatin and 0.98 s-1 for DNA. Thus, although the formation of RS complex on chromatin was much slower than on DNA, the actual rate of RNA chain initiation on chromatin was similar to that on DNA. The effects of temperature on the formation of RS complex were examined. On chick DNA, both the rate of formation and the amount of RS complex formed decreased as the temperature of preincubation was lowered from 37 degrees to 0 degrees. On chromatin, the t1/2 of formation of RS complex was independent of temperature, and the amount of complex formed was only slightly affected at changing, temperatures. The kinetics of initiation on chromatin is consistent with the hypothesis that the rate-limiting step in the formation of RS complex is dissociation of RNA polymerase from nonspecific interaction with chromosomal proteins. Furthermore, chromosomal proteins seem to interact with initiation sites to facilitate the opening of the DNA strands required for RS complex formation."

https://openalex.org/W1532041127,"An attempt was made, in starved Escherichia coli cells, to locate the site at which the process of ribosome degradation is initiated. Supernatant and rapidly sedimenting pellet fractions from exponentially growing and from carbon-starved cells were prepared, and the ribonucleic acids from these fractions were seperated by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and quantitated. The data indicated that 23 S, 16 S, and 5 S RNA are lost only from the pellet; and also that the low molecular weight RNA degradation products are confined to this fraction. Ribosomes from supernatant and pellet fractions were seperated on sucrose density gradients. The sedimentation profiles obtained indicated that pellet fractions of starved cells contain for the most part 50 S and 30 S subunits, whereas 70 S monosomes were most abundant in the supernatant fraction. In vitro measurements on RNA degradation in supernatant and rapidly sedimenting pellet fractions confirmed the in vivo data on the exclusive degradation of ribosomal RNA in the pellet. Based on these data and on previous observations, we suggest that the endoribonucleolytic attack which triggers ribosome degradation, occurs in free subunits attached to the rapidly sedimenting membrane fraction. Subsequently, the ribosome falls apart, and the small RNA pieces generated remain attached to the pellet fraction until their final degradation by the exonuclease."
