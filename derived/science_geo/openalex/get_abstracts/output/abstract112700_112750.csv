https://openalex.org/W2037793240,"Better characterization of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in patients with primary infection has important implications for the development of an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccine because vaccine strategies should target viral isolates with the properties of transmitted viruses. In five HIV-1 seroconverters, the viral phenotype was found to be uniformly macrophage-tropic and non-syncytium-inducing. Furthermore, the viruses were genotypically homogeneous within each patient, but a common signature sequence was not discernible among transmitted viruses. In the two cases where the sexual partners were also studied, the sequences of the transmitted viruses matched best with minor variants in the blood of the transmitters. There was also a stronger pressure to conserve sequences in gp120 than in gp41, nef, and p17, suggesting that a selective mechanism is involved in transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2008424322,"Prostaglandins play important and diverse roles in the CNS. The first step in prostaglandin synthesis involves enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid, which is catalyzed by prostaglandin H(PGH) synthase, also referred to as cyclooxygenase. We have cloned an inducible form of this enzyme from rat brain that is nearly identical to a murine, mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase identified from fibroblasts. Our studies indicate that this gene, here termed COX-2, is expressed throughout the forebrain in discrete populations of neurons and is enriched in the cortex and hippocampus. Neuronal expression is rapidly and transiently induced by seizures or NMDA-dependent synaptic activity. No expression is detected in glia or vascular endothelial cells. Basal expression of COX-2 appears to be regulated by natural synaptic activity in the developing and adult brain. Both basal and induced expression of COX-2 are inhibited by glucocorticoids, consistent with COX-2 regulation in peripheral tissues. Our studies indicate that COX-2 expression may be important in regulating prostaglandin signaling in brain. The marked inducibility in neurons by synaptic stimuli suggests a role in activity-dependent plasticity."

https://openalex.org/W2037517612,"During the assembly of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable region genes from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments, the germline-encoded repertoire is further diversified by processes that include the template-independent addition of nucleotides (N regions) at gene segment junctions. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-deficient lymphocytes had no N regions in their variable region genes, which shows that TdT is responsible for N region addition. In addition, certain variable region genes appeared at increased frequency in TdT-deficient thymocytes, which indicates that N region addition also influences repertoire development by alleviating sequence-specific constraints imposed on the joining of particular V, D, and J segments."
https://openalex.org/W1997056099,"In adult animals, template-independent (or N) nucleotides are frequently added during the rearrangement of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments of lymphocyte receptor genes, greatly enhancing junctional diversity. Receptor genes from adult mice carrying a mutation in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) gene have few N nucleotides, providing proof that this enzyme is essential for creating diversity. Unlike those from normal adults, receptor genes from adult mutant mice show extensive evidence of homology-directed recombination, suggesting that TdT blocks this process. Thus, switch-on of the TdT gene during the first week after birth provokes an even greater expansion of lymphocyte receptor diversity than had previously been thought."

https://openalex.org/W2026316964,"To understand the physiological role of the creatine kinase-phosphocreatine (CK-PCr) system in muscle bioenergetics, a null mutation of the muscle CK (M-CK) gene was introduced into the germline of mice. Mutant mice show no alterations in absolute muscle force, but lack the ability to perform burst activity. Their fast-twitch fibers have an increased intermyofibrillar mitochondrial volume and an increased glycogenolytic/glycolytic potential. PCr and ATP levels are normal in resting M-CK-deficient muscles, but rates of high energy phosphate exchange between PCr and ATP are at least 20-fold reduced. Strikingly, PCr levels decline normally during muscle exercise, suggesting that M-CK-mediated conversion is not the only route for PCr utilization in active muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2041241955,"In voltage-dependent ion channels, a voltage sensor region is responsible for channel activation and an aqueous pore is responsible for ion conduction. These two processes have been traditionally considered to be independent. We describe here a mutation in the putative pore region (W434F) that completely abolishes ion conduction without affecting the gating charge of the channel. Gating currents in the nonconductive mutant were found to be identical in their kinetic and steady-state properties to those in conductive channels. Gating current measurements could be performed without subtracting pulses and in the presence of normal physiological solutions. Application of internal tetraethylammonium (an open channel blocker) induced Off charge immobilization for large depolarizations, suggesting that the internal tetraethylammonium-binding site becomes available upon depolarization. We concluded that for this mutant, although the conduction pathway is not functional, the channel can still undergo the closed-open conformation in response to voltage changes."
https://openalex.org/W2049702083,"The gene encoding alpha 6(IV) collagen, COL4A6, was identified on the human X chromosome in a head-to-head arrangement and within 452 base pairs of the alpha 5(IV) collagen gene, COL4A5. In earlier studies, intragenic deletions of COL4A5 were detected in a subset of patients with Alport syndrome (AS), a hereditary defect of basement membranes. In some families, AS cosegregates with diffuse leiomyomatosis (DL), a benign smooth muscle tumor diathesis. Here it is shown that patients with AS-DL harbor deletions that disrupt both COL4A5 and COL4A6. Thus, type IV collagen may regulate smooth muscle differentiation and morphogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1988900658,"DUCHENNE and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) are X-linked recessive diseases caused by defective expression of dystrophin1,2. The mdx mouse, an animal model for DMD, has a mutation that eliminates expression of the 427K muscle and brain isoforms of dystrophin1,3,4. Although these animals do not display overt muscle weakness or impaired movement, the diaphragm muscle of the mdx mouse is severely affected and shows progressive myofibre degeneration and fibrosis which closely resembles the human disease5,6. Here we explore the feasibility of gene therapy for DMD by examining the potential of a full-length dystrophin transgene to correct dystrophic symptoms in mdx mice. We find that expression of dystrophin in muscles of transgenic mdx mice eliminates the morphological and immunohistological symptoms of muscular dystrophy. In addition, overexpression of dystrophin prevents the development of the abnormal mechanical properties associated with dystrophic muscle without causing deleterious side effects. Our results provide functional evidence for the feasibility of gene therapy for DMD."

https://openalex.org/W2042522249,"We have developed an exposed brain preparation for observing growth cone pathfinding behavior while performing in vivo pharmacological manipulations, and we used it to test whether Xenopus retinal growth cones need filopodia to navigate. Time-lapse video observation showed that cytochalasin B acted quickly and reversibly when applied; cytochalasin B-treated growth cones lacked filopodia, but had active lamellipodia and continued to advance slowly. Whereas normal retinotectal axons visualized with horseradish peroxidase turn caudally in the mid-diencephalon to reach the tectum, cytochalasin B-treated axons grew past the normal turning point and, instead, continued straight within the diencephalon. In dose-response experiments, pathfinding became abnormal in the same concentration range in which filopodia disappeared. These results suggest that filopodia are necessary for retinal growth cones to respond to guidance signals in the diencephalon."

https://openalex.org/W2063880503,"The lymphocyte-specific cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase p56lck (Lck) is essential for T cell development and activation. Its association with the co-receptor molecules, CD4 and CD8, is required for potentiation of antigen-specific signals through the T cell antigen receptor. To study the mechanism of action of Lck, hybrid molecules consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD4 fused to Lck or other Src family kinases were analyzed in an antigen-specific, CD4-dependent T cell hybridoma. Surprisingly, a chimera with a deletion of the Lck kinase domain was more active than the full-length protein. In contrast, point mutations in residues required for SH2 or kinase function resulted in moderately decreased activity, while a combination of these mutations rendered the chimera largely inactive. Different domains of CD4-associated Lck therefore have distinct functions that can independently contribute to T cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W1544277307,"The ras protooncogene is involved in regulation of cell growth. Mutations that activate the protein result in uncontrolled cell growth. Ras undergoes a series of posttranslational processing events, the first of which, farnesylation, is crucial for the function of the protein. Inhibitors of the farnesyltransferase enzyme are therefore potential candidates for the development of anticancer drugs. Tetrapeptides have been reported to be good inhibitors of this enzyme in vitro. We have synthesized analogs of the tetrapeptide Cys-Val-Phe-Met by replacement of the amino-terminal amide bonds. One inhibitor, B581, is permeable to the cell membrane. In the cell, it inhibits processing of two farnesylated proteins, H-ras and lamin A, but it does not inhibit processing of a geranylgeranylated protein, Rap 1A. Microinjection of B581 into frog oocytes inhibits maturation induced by activated, farnesylated H-ras but not maturation induced by activated, geranylgeranylated H-ras or by progesterone. These results demonstrate that this peptide mimic inhibits farnesylation selectively in the cell. The inhibition of farnesylation results in inhibition of H-ras function."
https://openalex.org/W1991873334,"The Y chromosome-linked sex determining locus (Sry) responsible for testis determination in mammals contains a DNA-binding motif (HMG box) that is conserved across species of marsupial and placental mammals (infraclasses Metatheria and Eutheria, respectively). But little to no sequence similarity is observed in flanking sequences between these two infraclasses, or among orders within each infraclass. We investigated the rate and pattern of evolution for the coding sequence of Sry in Old World mice and rats (subfamily Murinae). We found typical rates of synonymous substitution throughout the gene, but high rates of non-synonymous substitution, especially in the C-terminal (non-HMG box) region, when compared to other genes. This region is also characterized by a frame-shift mutation and variation in a trinucleotide repeat motif. These data suggest that the non-box region is either functionally unconstrained or has undergone species-specific adaptive divergence."

https://openalex.org/W1508367694,"Abstract Small GTP-binding proteins have been implicated in the regulation of many dynamic cellular processes. The carboxyl termini of parietal cell small GTP-binding proteins were cloned using a 3'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique with a degenerate oligonucleotide primer based on the WDTAGQE consensus GTP-binding sequence. Six out of 53 clones demonstrated a novel Rab sequence, now designated Rab25. The complete sequence was obtained using 3'-RACE and revealed a deduced amino acid sequence having 63% identity with Rab11. The deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated a carboxyl-terminal CCQNI and also a novel GTP-binding site sequence of WDTAGLE. Nevertheless, recombinant Rab25 was able to bind GTP on blot. A major 1.2 kilobase Rab25 message was detected throughout the gastrointestinal mucosa and in lung and kidney tissue. No message was detected in brain, heart, liver, or skeletal muscle. In gastric tissue, Rab25 was absent in the bowel wall; among mucosal cells, it was highly enriched in parietal cells compared to chief cells. Rab25 mRNA was also detected in several colon carcinoma lines including LIM1215 and HT-29. The results indicate that Rab25 represents a novel member of the Rab family with an epithelial distribution."

Scanning electron micrographs of goats fed controlled diets demonstrate that cementum bands preserve variations in the relative orientation of collagen fibers that reflect changes in the magnitude and frequency of occlusal forces from chewing different quality diets. Changes in the rate of tissue growth are also reflected in cementum bands as variations in the degree of mineralization."

https://openalex.org/W1553937914,"Transgenic mice were constructed that overexpress the human Glut1 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle. Transcription of the human Glut1 cDNA was driven by the rat myosin light chain 2 promoter. Soleus and quadriceps muscles from transgenic mice expressed increased levels of Glut1 protein relative to muscles obtained from nontransgenic littermates, but there was no difference in the level of Glut4 protein between the two groups. Skeletal muscles isolated from the transgenic animals exhibited 3-4-fold increases in basal glucose uptake relative to muscles obtained from nontransgenic littermates. Muscles isolated from nontransgenic littermates exhibited 2-3-fold increases in glucose transport after incubation in the presence of insulin, but no insulin-stimulated increase in transport was observed in the muscles of transgenic mice. Plasma glucose levels were reduced by 18 and 30%, respectively, in fed and fasted transgenic mice relative to their nontransgenic siblings, but insulin and glucagon levels were not significantly different between the two groups. Glucose disposal following an oral glucose load was markedly enhanced in the transgenic animals, and plasma lactate and beta-OH-butyrate levels were elevated in both fed and fasted transgenic mice. These data strongly support the hypothesis that glucose transport plays a key role in whole body glucose homeostasis. They also demonstrate that the level of a glucose transporter in skeletal muscle can significantly influence the blood glucose set point and alter the levels of other fuel metabolites in the blood."
https://openalex.org/W1987378376,"Glucocorticoids specifically increase Kv1.5 K+ channel mRNA in normal and clonal (GH3) rat pituitary cells. Here, we demonstrate that dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid agonist, rapidly induces Kv1.5 gene transcription, but does not affect Kv1.5 mRNA turnover (t1/2 approximately 0.5 hr) in GH3 cells. Immunoblots indicate that the steroid also increases the expression of the 76 kd Kv1.5 protein approximately 3-fold within 12 hr without altering its half-life (t1/2 approximately 4 hr). In contrast, Kv1.4 protein expression is unaffected. Finally, we find that the induction of Kv1.5 protein is associated with an increase in a noninactivating component of the voltage-gated K+ current. Our results indicate that hormones and neurotransmitters may act within hours to regulate excitability by controlling K+ channel gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1983667605,"THE intrauterine position relative to members of the same or opposite sex that a rodent fetus occupies affects both its morphology and behaviour when adult1–14. Female fetuses that mature between males are androgenized by testosterone crossing fetal membranes15,16, and their phenotypes as adults differ significantly from those of sisters that received less intrauterine exposure to exogenous testosterone17–20. We report here that adult female Mongolian gerbils that gestated between male fetuses produce litters containing a significantly greater proportion of sons than the litters produced by those that gestated between female fetuses. Consequently, daughters delivered by dams that gestated between male fetuses are more likely to have gestated between male fetuses and be androgenized in utero than are daughters of dams that gestated between female fetuses. Female gerbils thus tend to inherit the phenotype (either androgenized or not androgenized) of their respective mothers."

https://openalex.org/W2089925839,"Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a central role in the control of neuronal cell development and function. Yet, few neuronal protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been identified. We examined rat olfactory neuroepithelium for expression of novel PTPs potentially important in neuronal development and regeneration. Using the polymerase chain reaction with degenerate DNA oligomers directed to the conserved tyrosine phosphatase domain, we identified 6 novel tyrosine phosphatases. One of these, PTP NE-3, is a receptor-type PTP expressed selectively in both rat brain and olfactory neuroepithelium. In the olfactory neuroepithelium, PTP NE-3 expression is restricted to neurons and describes a novel pattern of expression with a high level in the immature neurons and a lower level in mature olfactory sensory neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1585972492,"Intracellular amastigotes of Leishmania major produce 6 x 10(4) copies/cell of a lipophosphoglycan (LPG) that is structurally distinct from the LPG produced by the extracellular promastigote form of L. major, Leishmania donovani, and Leishmania mexicana (reviewed by McConville, M. J. (1991) Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 15, 779-798). L. major amastigote LPG is composed of a lysoalkyl phosphatidylinositol lipid anchor that links via a diphosphorylated hexasaccharide core to a phosphoglycan (6-100 kDa). The structures of the anchor, the core, and the phosphoglycan were determined by monosaccharide and linkage analysis, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, and exoglycosidase microsequencing. The lipid anchor contains predominantly 1-O-alkylglycerols with 24:0 and 22:0 alkyl chains. The lipids are linked via a glycerol-myo-inositol-PO4 to a core glycan with the structure -PO4-6)Gal(alpha 1-)Gal(alpha 1-) Galf(beta 1-)[Glc(alpha 1-PO4-)]Man(alpha 1-)Man(alpha 1-)GlcN(alpha 1-). The chromatographic characteristics of the core glycan suggest that the saccharide components are linked similarly in amastigote and promastigote LPG. The phosphoglycan attached to the core consists of -PO4-6)Gal(beta 1-4)Man(alpha 1- repeats units which are either unsubstituted (70%) or substituted (30%) at the 3-position of the Gal residues with oligosaccharide side chains containing primarily Gal and some Glc. Thirteen different types of side chains were identified with the structures [Gal(beta 1-3)]x, where x = 1-11, or Glc(1-3)Glc(1-3), or Glc(1-3)Gal(beta 1-3), where glucose is probably in the beta-configuration. All monosaccharides in the phosphoglycan domain are in the pyranose configuration. The average number of repeat units per molecule is 36. The nonreducing terminus of the phosphoglycan chains probably terminates predominantly in the neutral disaccharide Gal(beta 1-4)Man(alpha 1-. Comparison of the structure of L. major amastigote LPG to L. major promastigote procyclic and metacyclic LPG forms (McConville, M. J., Turco, S. J., Furguson, M. A. J., and Sacks, D. L. (1992) Embo J. 11, 3593-3600) indicates that this molecule is developmentally modified throughout the different stages of the parasites' life cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1495603032,"Tetanus toxin is a potent inhibitor of neurotransmitter release, which acts as an intracellular metalloendoprotease that selectively cleaves synaptobrevin, a major membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. Recently, synaptobrevin has been found to form an ATP-dependent complex with N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and soluble NSF attachment protein, which are known to function in endosome fusion. Furthermore, a highly homologous isoform of synaptobrevin, named cellubrevin, was identified that is expressed in virtually all tissues in the endocytic pathway and is cleaved by tetanus toxin light chain in vitro, suggesting that cellubrevin may have a general function in intracellular fusion events. In the present study, we have analyzed whether cleavage of cellubrevin by tetanus toxin influences the ATP-dependent, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion of early endosomes in vitro. Our results show that endosome fusion is not affected by tetanus toxin although cellubrevin is almost completely proteolyzed, suggesting that the function of NSF in endosome fusion does not involve cellubrevin."
https://openalex.org/W1532623542,"The phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces phosphorylation of serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha 6A integrin subunit, as well as activation of the alpha 6A beta 1 laminin receptor. We examined whether phosphorylation correlates with the induction of high affinity binding of laminin by the alpha 6A beta 1 receptor. Two potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, serine 1041 and serine 1048, are present in the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha 6A subunit. We introduced point mutations into the alpha 6A cDNA, replacing either one or both of the serine residues with alanine. Wild-type and mutant alpha 6A cDNAs were transfected into K562 cells. All alpha 6A subunit mutants were expressed at levels similar to those of wild-type alpha 6A and formed heterodimers with endogenous beta 1. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of wild-type and mutant alpha 6A subunits in resting K562 cells and after treatment with PMA showed that serine 1041, but not serine 1048, is the target residue of PMA-induced phosphorylation. Cells expressing alpha 6A mutant subunits or wild-type alpha 6A transfectants all bound laminin in the presence, but not in the absence of PMA; however, the extent of binding differed. Cells transfected with alpha 6A containing the serine to alanine mutation showed a 2-3-fold higher binding to laminin than cells transfected with alpha 6A containing serine 1041. The results indicate that phosphorylation of the alpha 6A cytoplasmic domain is not required for the induction of high affinity of the alpha 6A beta 1 receptor by PMA, and suggest that, in contrast, it may reduce the affinity of this integrin for ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1574436763,"Bile acids were shown to be transported into barley mesophyll vacuoles. Uptake of the cholate conjugates taurocholate and glycocholate is strictly ATP-dependent. Uptake of taurocholate is a saturable process (Km = 40 microM) and is inhibited by vanadate but not by bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Together with the observation that the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP (5'-adenylyl beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate) does not stimulate, but rather inhibits, the ATP-dependent uptake of taurocholate, and that a 3-fold accumulation of the bile acid is observed in the presence of bafilomycin, these results suggest that taurocholate is transported into the vacuole by a primary active process as is the case for its canalicular secretion in rat liver (Nishida, T., Gatmaitan, Z., Che, M., and Arias, I. M. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 6590-6594). Taurocholate uptake is inhibited by other bile acids and is slightly stimulated by glutathione S-conjugates. The different responses of the glutathione S-conjugate (Martinoia, E., Grill, E., Tommasini, R., Kreuz, K., and Amrhein, N. (1993) Nature 364, 247-249) and the taurocholate transporters, respectively, to substrates, oligomycin, GTP, and UTP suggest the presence of at least two ATPases specifically involved in the transport of conjugates across the tonoplast. As cholate and its conjugates have so far not been reported to occur in plants, the physiological function of the novel transport ATPase described here is presently unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1496513668,"To analyze the mechanism by which histone H3 phosphorylation occurs specifically during mitosis, the effect of H1 on mitosis-specific H3 phosphorylation (Ser-10) was investigated in nucleosomes. H1 interaction with H1-depleted nucleosomes suppressed H3 phosphorylation including Ser-10 by approximately 50%. However, H1 interaction with DNA-free histone octamers failed to suppress H3 phosphorylation. The extent of suppression of H3 phosphorylation in nucleosomes with H1 prepared from synchronized HeLa cells was cell cycle-dependent. Binding with a highly phosphorylated mitotic H1 produced the least suppression of H3 phosphorylation, whereas binding with a lower H1 phosphorylation from G1 phase resulted in the greatest suppression. The results suggest that 1) mitotic H3 phosphorylation is suppressed with a lower level of H1 phosphorylation during interphase and 2) highly phosphorylated H1 during mitosis partially releases the suppression of mitotic H3 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2082045257,"The S4 sequence comprises at least part of the voltage sensor in Shaker K+ channels. Two site-directed mutations in the Shaker S4 sequence, R368Q and R377K, which decrease the voltage dependence of the whole-cell current, alter voltage-dependent gating at the single-channel level. Compared with the wild-type channel, they increase the latency to first opening, destabilize the open state, and alter the equilibria of voltage-dependent transitions, so that some of the charge movement occurs after the first opening. Whether these changes reflect a new mechanism of activation is a key question. Although the mutations alter the kinetics of many steps in the gating process, we conclude that the mutant channels are likely to activate using the same fundamental mechanism as wild-type channels."
