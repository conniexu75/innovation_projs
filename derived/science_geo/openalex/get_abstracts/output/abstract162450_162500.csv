Hence, an understanding of the factors regulating its expression and function is of substantial interest. In addition to genetic factors, exposure to drugs such as rifampin can profoundly affect its expression. So far, the mechanisms by which rifampin induces MDR1 expression are poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that the nuclear receptor PXR (pregnane X receptor) is involved in xenobiotic induction of CYP3A4. Because CYP3A4 and MDR1are often co-induced, we investigated whether a similar mechanism is also involved in MDR1 induction. The human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T was used as an intestinal model to study induction because in these cells the endogenous MDR1 gene is highly inducible by rifampin. The 5′-upstream region of human MDR1was examined for the presence of potential PXR response elements. Several binding sites were identified that form a complex regulatory cluster at about −8 kilobase pairs. Only one DR4 motif within this cluster is necessary for induction by rifampin. We conclude that induction of MDR1 is mediated by a DR4 motif in the upstream enhancer at about −8 kilobase pairs, to which PXR binds.

For instance, the antibiotic rifampin not only induces intestinal cytochrome P 450 3A4 enzyme but also elicits a significant increase of intestinal P-gp (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P.

As a consequence, the plasma concentrations of orally administered digoxin are dramatically reduced.So far the mechanisms by which rifampin and other inducing substances cause induction are poorly understood. Induction appears to take place at the transcriptional level, as MDR1 mRNA expression is elevated after treatment with inducers (8Zhao J.Y. Ikeguchi M. Eckersberg T. Kuo M.T.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Since CYP3A4 and MDR1 seem to be co-induced at least by some compounds (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 12Schuetz E.G. Beck W.T. Schuetz J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether a similar PXR-dependent mechanism is also involved inMDR1 induction. In this study we used the human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T as a model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MDR1 induction by rifampin because in these cells the endogenous MDR1 gene is highly inducible by rifampin. By DNA binding assays and transfections, we identified a distinct PXR binding site, a DR4 nuclear receptor response element, that is essential for MDR1 induction by rifampin.DISCUSSIONDue to the central role that intestinal P-gp plays in the absorption and presystemic elimination of many chemicals, including medicines, an understanding of the factors regulating its expression is of importance both from a clinical and toxicological point of view. Because the mechanisms of induction are poorly understood, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which rifampin inducesMDR1 gene expression using an intestinal cell line. Rifampin was selected because it is a powerful inducer of intestinal P-gp both in human duodenal biopsies (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and in a cell line (12Schuetz E.G. Beck W.T. Schuetz J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), whereas for other inducers, only in vitro data are available, thus raising doubts if results obtained in cell lines with these substances can be extrapolated for the human in vivo situation. Since a time- and concentration-dependent induction ofMDR1 by rifampin was observed in the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T, it proved a suitable model for intestinal MDR1induction. The biphasic induction is indicative of a two-stage mechanism of induction by rifampin. The first and immediate increase can be explained by activation of pre-existing factors, probably PXR, and is therefore supposed to be independent of de novoprotein biosynthesis. The second increase, starting at about 24 h, however, probably required de novo protein biosynthesis. This would imply that additional genes are induced by rifampin, which then participate in MDR1 induction. The reason for the decrease in MDR1 expression between 8 and 16 h is unclear and remains to be elucidated.The reported co-induction of CYP3A4 andMDR1 (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate whether PXR is also involved in induction ofMDR1.

Kliewer S.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), induced MDR1. Only the PXR activator coumestrol did not induce MDR1. Induction of MDR1 by other drugs apart from rifampin, known as CYP3A4 inducers and PXR activators, provided evidence that PXR is probably the factor responsible for induction of MDR1 in LS174T cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, PXR mRNA is expressed in LS174T cells (data not shown).We identified an enhancer element at about −8 kb of theMDR1 upstream region that contains several nuclear receptor binding motifs and mediates induction by rifampin in LS174T cells. Within this enhancer element, there are three DR4 motifs (numbered I-III from 5′ to 3′) and one DR3 and ER6 motif, respectively, all overlapping with at least one half-site. A similar complex organization of nuclear response elements has also been reported in the distal enhancer module (XREM) of CYP3A4, which mediates the hPXR-dependent induction by xenobiotics in co-operation with a proximal promoter element (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In contrast toCYP3A4, such a proximal promoter element is missing inMDR1. As shown by us, the proximal promoter region ofMDR1 cannot be induced by rifampin. Similar to the XREM ofCYP3A4, only one out of several motifs to which PXR binds is necessary for induction. In the XREM of CYP3A4, a DR3 motif mediates induction (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), whereas in MDR1 it is the DR4(I) motif, which is the only consensus motif present in MDR1. Mutation of the ER6/DR4(III) motif in the MDR1 enhancer was associated with an increased induction. A similar observation has been made with the mutated ER6 motif in the CYP3A4 XREM (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Therefore it is quite likely that there are factors in LS174T cells that bind to the ER6/DR4(III) and probably exert a suppressive effect on the activity of DR4(I). In agreement with this, dimers of ER6/DR4(III) cannot be induced, although PXR binds in vitroto the motif. The ER6 motif in the proximal promoter ofCYP3A23 also showed binding of PXR but did not mediate PXR-dependent induction (27Huss J.M. Kasper C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is a common feature of all these imperfect ER6 motifs, to which PXR binds in vitro but which do not mediate induction, that a more or less well conserved DR4 motif is contained within the ER6. It is probably due to the imperfect nature of these ER6 motifs that other factors can bind to them or to the enclosed degenerate DR4 with higher affinity than PXR. Likely candidates could be the nuclear receptors COUP-TFI, LXR, and CAR, which all bind to degenerate DR4 motifs (28Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 29Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 30Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). LXR and COUP-TFI are expressed in LS174T cells (data not shown). Competition of different nuclear receptors, which exert opposing effects onMDR1 expression, could explain the pronounced interindividual variability in MDR1 induction by rifampin observed in humans (9Lown K.S. Kolars J.C. Ghosh M. Schmiedlin-Ren P. Watkins P.B. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110 (abstr.): A344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The magnitude of induction is probably dependent on the relative amounts of competing factors. Consequently, the total amount of PXR alone does not determine the extent of induction. On the other hand, mutations in the PXR response elements that change the binding affinity of PXR or competing factors can also cause the observed variability of MDR1 induction in different individuals.The DR4(I) motif mediating induction of MDR1 is the first physiological PXR response element of DR4-type, whereas previously described PXR response elements in CYP3A promoters were all of ER6 and DR3-type. This confirms results obtained with synthetic AG(G/T)TCA repeats of different spacing, which suggest the existence of DR4 and DR5 motifs in PXR-regulated gene promoters (15Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The degenerate DR4(II) motif to which PXR binds in vitro is not necessary for induction. Other factors in addition to PXR probably bind to DR4(II) in LS174T cells.Co-transfection of an expression plasmid for hPXR directly demonstrated that PXR mediates induction of MDR1 through the identified enhancer. Moreover, PXR activates the reporter gene with theMDR1 enhancer even in the absence of rifampin treatment. Co-transfection probably changes the relative amounts of PXR and competing factors, leading to an increased binding of PXR to its binding sites in the MDR1 enhancer. Transcriptional activation then might be due to the presence of endogenous ligands for PXR in LS174T cells. As reported previously, pregnanes are likely candidates for endogenous ligands (16Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar).This study provides evidence that a similar mechanism is responsible for induction of CYP3A4 and MDR1 by xenobiotics. The induction of both genes requires nuclear receptor response elements in proximal promoter and/or enhancer regions to which PXR binds. Recently it has been shown in knockout mice that PXR is necessary for induction of CYP3A (31Xie W. Barwick J.L. Downes M. Blumberg B. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Brunt E.M. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Whether this is also true forMDR1 induction remains to be clarified. CYP3A4 and P-gp are believed to constitute a physiological barrier in the intestine that prevents the absorption of harmful chemicals contained in the diet (32Watkins P.B. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 27: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). When the organism is exposed to increasing concentrations of xenobiotics, induction seems to be a mechanism to strengthen the barrier function in the intestine by coordinated up-regulation of both the drug metabolizing enzyme and the drug transporter. The question arises of whether additional drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters, which can contribute to barrier function, are also up-regulated by a similar PXR-dependent mechanism. The MDR1 1gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays an important role in the transport of hydrophobic xenobiotics and peptides from the inside to the outside of cells. Initially discovered in cancer cells as a mechanism responsible for resistance against certain cytostatic drugs (reviewed in Ref. 1Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Biochem.

Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 12Schuetz E.G. Beck W.T. Schuetz J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether a similar PXR-dependent mechanism is also involved inMDR1 induction. In this study we used the human colon carcinoma cell line LS174T as a model to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of MDR1 induction by rifampin because in these cells the endogenous MDR1 gene is highly inducible by rifampin. By DNA binding assays and transfections, we identified a distinct PXR binding site, a DR4 nuclear receptor response element, that is essential for MDR1 induction by rifampin. DISCUSSIONDue to the central role that intestinal P-gp plays in the absorption and presystemic elimination of many chemicals, including medicines, an understanding of the factors regulating its expression is of importance both from a clinical and toxicological point of view. Because the mechanisms of induction are poorly understood, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which rifampin inducesMDR1 gene expression using an intestinal cell line. Rifampin was selected because it is a powerful inducer of intestinal P-gp both in human duodenal biopsies (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and in a cell line (12Schuetz E.G. Beck W.T. Schuetz J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), whereas for other inducers, only in vitro data are available, thus raising doubts if results obtained in cell lines with these substances can be extrapolated for the human in vivo situation. Since a time- and concentration-dependent induction ofMDR1 by rifampin was observed in the colon carcinoma cell line LS174T, it proved a suitable model for intestinal MDR1induction. The biphasic induction is indicative of a two-stage mechanism of induction by rifampin. The first and immediate increase can be explained by activation of pre-existing factors, probably PXR, and is therefore supposed to be independent of de novoprotein biosynthesis. The second increase, starting at about 24 h, however, probably required de novo protein biosynthesis. This would imply that additional genes are induced by rifampin, which then participate in MDR1 induction. The reason for the decrease in MDR1 expression between 8 and 16 h is unclear and remains to be elucidated.The reported co-induction of CYP3A4 andMDR1 (11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P.

Induction of MDR1 by other drugs apart from rifampin, known as CYP3A4 inducers and PXR activators, provided evidence that PXR is probably the factor responsible for induction of MDR1 in LS174T cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, PXR mRNA is expressed in LS174T cells (data not shown).We identified an enhancer element at about −8 kb of theMDR1 upstream region that contains several nuclear receptor binding motifs and mediates induction by rifampin in LS174T cells. Within this enhancer element, there are three DR4 motifs (numbered I-III from 5′ to 3′) and one DR3 and ER6 motif, respectively, all overlapping with at least one half-site. A similar complex organization of nuclear response elements has also been reported in the distal enhancer module (XREM) of CYP3A4, which mediates the hPXR-dependent induction by xenobiotics in co-operation with a proximal promoter element (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). In contrast toCYP3A4, such a proximal promoter element is missing inMDR1. As shown by us, the proximal promoter region ofMDR1 cannot be induced by rifampin. Similar to the XREM ofCYP3A4, only one out of several motifs to which PXR binds is necessary for induction. In the XREM of CYP3A4, a DR3 motif mediates induction (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), whereas in MDR1 it is the DR4(I) motif, which is the only consensus motif present in MDR1. Mutation of the ER6/DR4(III) motif in the MDR1 enhancer was associated with an increased induction. A similar observation has been made with the mutated ER6 motif in the CYP3A4 XREM (18Goodwin B. Hodgson E. Liddle C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Therefore it is quite likely that there are factors in LS174T cells that bind to the ER6/DR4(III) and probably exert a suppressive effect on the activity of DR4(I). In agreement with this, dimers of ER6/DR4(III) cannot be induced, although PXR binds in vitroto the motif. The ER6 motif in the proximal promoter ofCYP3A23 also showed binding of PXR but did not mediate PXR-dependent induction (27Huss J.M. Kasper C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 48-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is a common feature of all these imperfect ER6 motifs, to which PXR binds in vitro but which do not mediate induction, that a more or less well conserved DR4 motif is contained within the ER6. It is probably due to the imperfect nature of these ER6 motifs that other factors can bind to them or to the enclosed degenerate DR4 with higher affinity than PXR. Likely candidates could be the nuclear receptors COUP-TFI, LXR, and CAR, which all bind to degenerate DR4 motifs (28Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 29Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). LXR and COUP-TFI are expressed in LS174T cells (data not shown). Competition of different nuclear receptors, which exert opposing effects onMDR1 expression, could explain the pronounced interindividual variability in MDR1 induction by rifampin observed in humans (9Lown K.S. Kolars J.C. Ghosh M. Schmiedlin-Ren P. Watkins P.B. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110 (abstr.): A344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Greiner B. Eichelbaum M. Fritz P. Kreichgauer H.P. von Richter O. Zundler J. Kroemer H.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The magnitude of induction is probably dependent on the relative amounts of competing factors. Consequently, the total amount of PXR alone does not determine the extent of induction. On the other hand, mutations in the PXR response elements that change the binding affinity of PXR or competing factors can also cause the observed variability of MDR1 induction in different individuals.The DR4(I) motif mediating induction of MDR1 is the first physiological PXR response element of DR4-type, whereas previously described PXR response elements in CYP3A promoters were all of ER6 and DR3-type. This confirms results obtained with synthetic AG(G/T)TCA repeats of different spacing, which suggest the existence of DR4 and DR5 motifs in PXR-regulated gene promoters (15Blumberg B. Sabbagh Jr., W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. van Meter C.M. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). The degenerate DR4(II) motif to which PXR binds in vitro is not necessary for induction. Other factors in addition to PXR probably bind to DR4(II) in LS174T cells.Co-transfection of an expression plasmid for hPXR directly demonstrated that PXR mediates induction of MDR1 through the identified enhancer. Moreover, PXR activates the reporter gene with theMDR1 enhancer even in the absence of rifampin treatment. Co-transfection probably changes the relative amounts of PXR and competing factors, leading to an increased binding of PXR to its binding sites in the MDR1 enhancer. Transcriptional activation then might be due to the presence of endogenous ligands for PXR in LS174T cells. As reported previously, pregnanes are likely candidates for endogenous ligands (16Kliewer S.A. Moore J.T. Wade L. Staudinger J.L. Watson M.A. Jones S.A. McKee D.D. Oliver B.B. Willson T.M. Zetterstrom R.H. Perlmann T. Lehmann J.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar).This study provides evidence that a similar mechanism is responsible for induction of CYP3A4 and MDR1 by xenobiotics. The induction of both genes requires nuclear receptor response elements in proximal promoter and/or enhancer regions to which PXR binds. Recently it has been shown in knockout mice that PXR is necessary for induction of CYP3A (31Xie W. Barwick J.L. Downes M. Blumberg B. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C. Neuschwander-Tetri B.A. Brunt E.M. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 2000; 406: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Whether this is also true forMDR1 induction remains to be clarified. CYP3A4 and P-gp are believed to constitute a physiological barrier in the intestine that prevents the absorption of harmful chemicals contained in the diet (32Watkins P.B. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 1997; 27: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). When the organism is exposed to increasing concentrations of xenobiotics, induction seems to be a mechanism to strengthen the barrier function in the intestine by coordinated up-regulation of both the drug metabolizing enzyme and the drug transporter. The question arises of whether additional drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters, which can contribute to barrier function, are also up-regulated by a similar PXR-dependent mechanism. Due to the central role that intestinal P-gp plays in the absorption and presystemic elimination of many chemicals, including medicines, an understanding of the factors regulating its expression is of importance both from a clinical and toxicological point of view.

Insulin signaling is initiated by the phosphorylation of specific tyrosyl residues of the cell surface insulin receptor, which activates its exogenous kinase activity and promotes the phosphorylation of IRS proteins on specific tyrosine residues (1Withers D.J.

Since PTPases are high turnover number enzymes, physiological suppression of PTPase catalytic activity has been postulated to be a key feature of their regulation within the cellular environment to allow tyrosine phosphorylation to proceed in a balanced manner (8Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). PTPases have in common a conserved ∼230-amino acid domain that contains the cysteine residue that catalyzes the hydrolysis of protein phosphotyrosine residues by the formation of a cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate (9Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z.Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have recently provided evidence that reactive oxygen species, including H2O2, can oxidize and inactivate PTPasesin vivo (11Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Since only the reduced form of the catalytic site is enzymatically active, stepwise and progressively irreversible oxidative inhibition is emerging as an important means by which PTPase activity can be suppressed in specific signal transduction pathways (13Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 14Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the present work, we show that insulin stimulation of hepatoma and adipose-like cells causes the rapid formation of intracellular H2O2, which is associated with significantly decreased overall PTPase activity as well as a reduction in the specific activity of PTP1B, a PTPase that has been strongly implicated in the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. Inhibition of the insulin-stimulated production of H2O2 by catalase treatment blocks the PTPase inactivation and reduces insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism integral to the early steps in insulin signaling that contribute to the steady-state balance and propagation of the insulin action cascade. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated with insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine as described previously (15Gagnon A. Sorisky A. Obes. Res. 1998; 6: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved overnight in medium containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin prior to insulin stimulation. Intracellular H2O2 production was detected by fluorescence of 5,6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCF-DA; catalog number C-6827, Molecular Probes) on confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission at 515–540 nm. To avoid photo-oxidation, the fluorescence image was collected by a single rapid scan with identical parameters for all samples (16Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Endogenous PTPase activities as isolated from the cellular environment were measured using a novel anaerobic technique to avoid air oxidation as we described recently (41Zhu, L., Zilbering, A., Wu, X., Joseph, J. I., Jabbour, S., Deeb, W., and Goldstein, B. J. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). Briefly, an enclosed anaerobic work station (Forma Scientific number 901024) provided an oxygen-free environment (gas mixture of N2:H2:CO2 = 85:10:5) for cell homogenization, sealing tubes for centrifugations, immunoprecipitations, and PTPase enzyme assays. After the indicated treatments, cells were snap-frozen in liquid N2, introduced into the anaerobic chamber in a frozen state, and disrupted by scraping into ice-cold, deoxygenated homogenization buffer (150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) followed by brief sonication. The whole cell lysate was prepared by adding 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, mixing on ice for 45 min, and clearing of the lysate by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. Prior to solubilization, the supernatant resulting from centrifugation of the homogenate at 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C was taken as the cytosol. The solubilized particulate fraction was prepared by adding Triton X-100 to the pellet from the ultracentrifugation step and incubating and clearing as above by centrifugation. Protein was measured using the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). PTPase activity was determined in cell fractions containing 30 μg of protein in a final volume of 100 μl at 30 °C for 30 min in reaction buffer containing 10 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP; Sigma) and 2 mm EDTA in 20 mm MES at pH 6.0. Where indicated, assay samples were incubated with 1 mm DTT on ice for 10 min prior to enzyme assay. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m NaOH, and the absorption was determined at 410 nm (18Goldstein B.J. Bittner-Kowalczyk A. White M.F. Harbeck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4283-4289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). PTPase activity is reported as the optical density from hydrolysis of pNPP. Under strictly anaerobic conditions, PTP1B was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody directed at a C-terminal epitope that preserves its enzymatic activity (Oncogene Sciences; Ab-2) followed by adsorption to Trisacryl protein G (Pierce). PTPase activity was measured by the hydrolysis of pNPP in the anaerobic chamber in washed immunoprecipitates as described above. Control samples using non-immune mouse IgG showed minimal background PTPase activity (<5% of the activity with Ab-2). Samples of 3T3-L1 cell lysates containing 75 μg of protein were subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) or polyclonal antibodies to IRS-1 or insulin receptor β-subunit proteins (Transduction Laboratories) as described previously (19Ahmad F. Li P.M. Meyerovitch J. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20503-20508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 4G10 or with conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for the polyclonal antibodies, using conditions supplied by the manufacturer (Pierce). The blots were quantitated using an ImageStation 440 (Eastman Kodak Co.). An oxidant signal in response to insulin was demonstrated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes loaded with CM-H2DCF-DA, a redox indicator dye that is trapped intracellularly after cleavage by cellular esterases (Fig. 1). When oxidized in situ, DCF generates a signal that can be visualized by fluorescence confocal microscopy (16Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Following stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with 100 nm insulin, a strong oxidant signal was detected by DCF fluorescence within 1 min, peaked at 5 min, and began to dissipate by 10 min (Fig. 1 A). The oxidant generated was shown to be H2O2, since preincubation of the cells with catalase completely obliterated the fluorescent signal. A dose-response study using insulin exposure for 5 min showed that H2O2 production was detectable between 0.1 and 1 nm and was maximal at 10 nm (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were observed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells, with an insulin-stimulated H2O2 signal evident at 1 min that increased through 10 min of incubation and was completely blocked by catalase preincubation (Fig. 1 C). To determine whether the insulin-stimulated generation of intracellular H2O2 affected the endogenous activity of cellular PTPases, we applied a novel approach recently established in our laboratory that involves sample handling and analysis under anaerobic conditions (41Zhu, L., Zilbering, A., Wu, X., Joseph, J. I., Jabbour, S., Deeb, W., and Goldstein, B. J. (2001) FASEB J., in press.Google Scholar). This method preserves the activity of PTPases as isolated from the cultured cells and avoids oxidation and artifactual enzyme inhibition that occurs on exposure to air. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 100 nm insulin for 5 min resulted in a 32–52% reduction in overall PTPase activity in the cell homogenate, the cytosol, and the solubilized particulate fraction (p < 0.001) (Fig.2 A). Biochemical reduction of the enzyme samples with DTT prior to PTPase assay had no significant effect on the control samples prior to insulin treatment, but fully restored the reduced PTPase activity of the insulin-treated samples, indicating that they had been reversibly oxidized and inactivated by insulin exposure. A similar but more striking effect was observed using 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where insulin treatment caused a 62% drop in PTPase activity in the cell lysate (p < 0.001), which was restored to within control levels by treatment of the assay samples with DTT (Fig. 2 B). To determine the role of insulin-induced H2O2in the oxidative inhibition of cellular PTPase activity, cells were preincubated with catalase prior to insulin stimulation and PTPase assay. Catalase had no significant effect on the basal level of PTPase activity. However, the presence of catalase blocked the reduction of PTPase activity in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lysate induced by insulin to a level that was not significantly different from the control samples (Fig. 2). This important finding indicated that H2O2 mediated the oxidative inhibition of cellular PTPase activity associated with insulin stimulation. To explore whether the insulin-stimulated generation of H2O2 affected the specific activity of PTP1B itself as isolated from intact cells, we immunoprecipitated PTP1B from snap-frozen HepG2 cell lysates under anaerobic conditions and assayed its activity within the anaerobic chamber. Following insulin treatment for 2 or 5 min, the activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1B was reduced to 46 and 29% of control, respectively (Fig.3 A). In the continued presence of insulin, this effect was sustained for at least 10 min (not shown). For comparison, direct treatment of HepG2 cells with 0.5 mmH2O2 for 5 min prior to cell lysis caused a 66% reduction of PTP1B enzyme activity (Fig. 3 A). Further insight into the biochemical alterations induced in PTP1B following insulin stimulation of HepG2 cells was obtained by treating the immunoprecipitated enzyme with DTT prior to the PTPase assay (Fig.3 B). As in the previous experiment, insulin stimulation reduced the PTP1B enzyme activity to 28% of control. Treatment of the isolated enzyme with DTT restored the activity to 83% of control, indicating that the insulin-induced oxidative inactivation of PTP1B was largely reversible by biochemical reduction. In contrast, treatment of the cells directly with H2O2 reduced the catalytic activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1B to a similar degree (26% of control), but this effect was less reversible in vitro with DTT incubation, to only 61% of the control level (Fig.3 B). Thus, H2O2 itself causes a greater degree of PTP1B catalytic thiol oxidation compared with cell treatment with insulin. Treatment of immunoprecipitated PTP1B from the control HepG2 cells with DTT increased the enzyme activity slightly but significantly by 16% (p = 0.03), suggesting thatin situ, only a small fraction of the enzyme is present in an oxidized state that is activable by biochemical reduction in vitro. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin treatment also potently reduced the activity of immunoprecipitated PTP1B to 12% of control, which was reversible to 72% of control by preincubation of the immunoprecipitated enzyme with DTT prior to PTPase assay (Fig.3 C). To further clarify the role of H2O2 in the reduced activity of PTP1B from the insulin-treated cells, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were preincubated with catalase, which completely blocks the insulin-stimulated generation of H2O2 in these cells, as shown above in the experiments utilizing DCF-DA fluorescence. Insulin stimulation of the 3T3-L1 adipocytes reduced PTP1B activity in the control cells by 64%, which was completely prevented by preincubating the cells with catalase (Fig. 3 D). Catalase similarly prevented the insulin-stimulated reduction in PTP1B activity in HepG2 cells (not shown), indicating that in both of these cell types, the insulin-induced oxidative inhibition of PTP1B activity, mediated by H2O2, was proportionally greater than the decrease in overall PTPase activity elicited by insulin in the cell lysates. A receptor-mediated effect of insulin on PTP1B activity was also suggested by treatment of HepG2 cells with staurosporine (20Elberg G. Li J. Leibovitch A. Shechter Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which blocks insulin receptor autophosphorylation in the HepG2 cells (not shown), and reduced the insulin inhibition of PTP1B enzyme activity by 40% (Fig. 4 A). To determine the reversibility of the insulin effect, insulin bound to the HepG2 cells was dissociated with a mild acid wash after various times of insulin stimulation, and after an additional 10 min, the cellular PTP1B activity was determined by immunoprecipitation under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 4 B). At each time point, continued exposure to insulin led to a persistent reduction in PTP1B activity; however, removal of the bound insulin fully reversed the inhibition of PTP1B activity following incubations with insulin of up to 30 min. Finally, we evaluated the effect of blocking the insulin-induced production of H2O2 with catalase on insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and IRS proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.5). Catalase treatment had no effect on the basal level of insulin receptor or IRS phosphorylation in the serum-starved cells. However, catalase reduced the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor by 48 and 44% and similarly reduced the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins by 34 and 43%, respectively, at 1 or 5 min of insulin treatment. The protein abundance of IRS-1 and the insulin receptor β-subunit was unchanged by incubation of the cells with catalase (Fig. 5 A). Taken together, these data suggest that by preventing the insulin-induced inhibition of PTP1B, catalase treatment results in a sustained level of PTP1B activity, which appears to be inhibitory to insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of its receptor and restricts the propagation of the early insulin signal to IRS proteins. Cross-talk involving oxidative inactivation of PTPases and the signaling pathways they regulate has become evident in recent work showing that reactive oxygen species can be generated by stimulation of cells with growth factors and cytokines (12Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Specifically, H2O2 has been implicated in the activation of tyrosine phosphorylation cascades in a manner that mimics the effect of ligands such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor; also, H2O2 can serve as an integral constituent of downstream growth factor signal transduction (16Bae Y.S.

Recent data has also suggested that signal transduction pathways modulated by reactive oxygen species associated with the action of growth factors and cytokines may involve the stepwise oxidation and inactivation of PTPase enzymes (11Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane E.J. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 12Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of enzymes in the PTPase family to oxidative inactivation resides in the characteristic active site sequence motif, which requires the catalytic cysteine moiety to be in a reduced state (10Zhang Z.Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The catalytic thiol hydrogen lies in spatial proximity to amino acid side chains adjacent to the enzyme active site that strongly affect its ionization, effectively lowering its pK a to more than 3 units below that found in a typical cysteine and facilitating its derivatization at physiological pH (9Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 28Barford D. Das A.K. Egloff M.P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 133-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This cysteine residue is susceptible to oxidation to progressively more inert forms. First, this forms the sulfenic (-SOH) form, which is reversible and amenable to reduction by cellular mechanisms or by reducing agents in vitro; sequential steps of oxidation may then lead to sulfinic (-SO2H) and sulfonic (-SO3H) forms and can lead to irreversible PTPase inactivation. This general scheme may constitute a major regulatory mechanism for PTPases within the cellular environment. PTP1B, in particular, appears to be a cellular target for oxidative inactivation possibly followed by disulfide conjugation with glutathione (glutathiolation), processes that are at least partially balanced by cellular reductases (13Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 14Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

PTP1B was one of the first specific PTPases to be implicated in the negative regulation of insulin receptor autophosphorylation and post-receptor insulin signaling (7Calera M.R. Vallega G. Pilch P.F.

The most compelling evidence for a physiological role of PTP1B in insulin action has been the recent demonstration of enhanced insulin sensitivity and potentiation of insulin-stimulated protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in PTP1B knockout mice (33Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

Changes in the intracellular enzymatic activity of PTP1B may also affect insulin action in adipose tissue from obese subjects (35Cheung A. Kusari J. Jansen D. Bandyopadhyay D. Kusari A. Bryer-Ash M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1999; 134: 115-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PTP1B has been recognized as a target for drug development to enhance insulin signaling through enhancing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the insulin action pathway (36Kennedy B.P. Ramachandran C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and novel, relatively specific inhibitors of PTP1B have been reported (37Malamas M.S. Sredy J. Gunawan I. Mihan B. Sawicki D.R. Seestaller L. Sullivan D. Flam B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 995-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present work, we provide evidence for a close coupling between the insulin-induced generation of cellular H2O2and the oxidative inactivation of the catalytic activity of PTP1B. In early studies of insulin action, it was recognized that H2O2 could mimic at least some of the actions of insulin (38Czech M.P. Lawrence J.C.J. Lynn W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1001-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and more recent work has demonstrated that H2O2 is elaborated during physiological insulin signal transduction in adipose cells (39Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Some years ago, Meyerovitch and colleagues (40Meyerovitch J. Backer J.M. Csermely P. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10338-10344Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) made the observation that stimulation of Fao rat hepatoma cells with nanomolar concentrations of insulin over a time course of several minutes caused a significant reduction in cytosolic PTPase activity measured against an insulin receptor phosphopeptide. Among the novel findings in our present study is the demonstration that insulin stimulation generates a burst of H2O2in multiple types of insulin-sensitive cells. In addition to the down-regulation of the specific activity of cellular PTP1B by oxidants elicited by insulin, it is possible that this burst of H2O2 also affects downstream insulin signaling, as shown in response to growth factors in other cell types (12Herrlich P. Bohmer F.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Finkel T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar,26Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Further studies detailing the implications of this pathway for distal insulin signaling in various cell types are underway. In summary, we report here the novel observation that in both 3T3-L1 adipocytes and hepatoma cells, the elaboration of reactive oxygen species (H2O2) by insulin is associated with reversible oxidative inactivation of overall cellular PTPase activity and specifically of PTP1B. This effect, in turn, markedly influences insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins. Given the growing body of evidence that PTP1B is integrally involved in the negative regulation of insulin signaling, this reciprocal regulation of the balance of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation may play a critical role in signal transduction in the insulin action pathway.

The anti-angiogenic properties of thalidomide have been demonstrated by its ability to inhibit growth factor-induced neovascularization in rabbit (26D'Amato R.J. Loughnan M.S. Flynn E. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4082-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar) and mouse corneal assays (27Kenyon B.M. Browne F. D'Amato R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Neovascularization occurs through a process that requires the induction of a number of cellular genes including IL-8 (28Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 29Joussen A.M. Germann T. Kirchhof B. Graefe's Arch. Clin. Exp. Ophthalmol. 1999; 237: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transcriptional up-regulation of IL-8, as well TNFαand IL-12, can occur through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (30Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a DNA-binding factor, originally identified as a regulator of immunoglobulin κ light chain gene expression (31Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar), that functions as a dimer of subunits of a family of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors (32Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 33Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar). Five mammalian members of the family have been identified as follows: p50/NF-κB1, p65/RelA, c-Rel, RelB, and p52/NF-κB2. Although numerous homodimeric and heterodimeric forms of this factor have been identified, classic NF-κB is composed of the p50-p65 heterodimer. In unstimulated cells, the majority of NF-κB is localized to the cytoplasm where it is tightly bound to the inhibitory proteins of the IκB family. Specifically, IκBα is a key molecular target involved in the regulation of NF-κB transcription factors during inflammatory responses. Upon stimulation by extracellular inducers of NF-κB, such as TNFα or IL-1β (30Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex on serine residues 32 and 36 (34). This phosphorylation leads to the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of IκBα by the proteasome followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Once NF-κB enters the nucleus, it can positively regulate the expression of genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response, such as IL-8,IL-12, and TNFα (35Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4300) Google Scholar). Additionally, NF-κB is now known to be a critical regulator of the oncogenic process through its ability to regulate genes involved in cell growth, suppression of apoptosis, and metastasis (36Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar, 37Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G.

We demonstrate here that NF-κB DNA binding is inhibited by thalidomide through a mechanism that involves the suppression of IKK activity. Consistent with its ability to block NF-κB binding, we show that thalidomide also inhibits the expression of IL-8 message as well as other NF-κB-dependent genes. Our data provide a molecular mechanism to potentially explain the anti-inflammatory and anti-oncogenic properties of thalidomide. Human Jurkat T cell lymphocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The human vascular endothelial cell line EA.hy926 (a gift from Cora Jean S. Edgell, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium H supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium supplement (Sigma) and antibiotics. Cells were treated with 10 (Jurkat) or 5 ng/ml (EA.hy926) human recombinant TNFα (Promega) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Thalidomide (generously provided by the Celgene Corp., Warren, NJ) was resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and used at a final concentration of 10 or 40 μg/ml. IL-1β (Promega) was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. Cells were passaged 24 h prior to treatment in 10 ml of medium in 100-mm dishes (EA.hy926) or 25-cm2 flasks (Jurkat) at a density of 2 × 106 (EA.hy926) or 1 × 106 cells/ml (Jurkat). Post-treatment, the cells were harvested by scraping (EA.hy926) or by centrifugation (Jurkat), washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed, on ice, in 3 pellet volumes of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 (EA.hy926) or 0.075% (Jurkat) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Nuclei were pelleted and washed once in 100 μl of cytoplasmic extraction buffer without Nonidet P-40 and repelleted. The supernatant was added to the cytoplasmic samples. The nuclear pellet was resuspended and lysed in 2 pellet volumes of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25% glycerol, 2.5 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The final salt concentration was adjusted to 400 mm with NaCl. The cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. A final concentration of 20% glycerol was added to the cytoplasmic extracts. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were assayed for protein concentrations using a Bio-Rad protein assay dye that incorporates the Bradford method. All extracts were stored at −70 °C until analyzed. Equal amounts of nuclear extract (5 μg of protein) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled DNA probe containing an NF-κB-binding site from the class I MHC promoter (5′-CAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTCCACAGTTTCACTTC-3′) or an Oct-1-binding site (5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) plus 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The final salt concentration was adjusted to 50–100 mm using NaCl. Complexes were separated on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, dried, and autoradiographed. For supershift assays, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min with 1–2 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the NF-κB family subunits p65 (Rockland Co., Gilbertsville, PA) or p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) prior to the addition of the DNA probe. Transient transfections were performed using Superfect (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and 5 μg of a luciferase reporter construct containing 3 tandem wild-type or mutated NF-κB-binding sites from the promoter region of the class I MHC promoter (a gift from Bill Sugden, University of Wisconsin, Madison). 24 h post-transfection, the cells were either not treated or treated with TNFα with or without thalidomide for specified times. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase assays were performed in duplicate using equal amounts of protein with 200 μmd-luciferin (Sigma) as the substrate (39Cheshire J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6746-6754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative light units were measured with an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments, Inc, Nashua, NH) and standardized to light units obtained from transfections performed with salmon sperm DNA. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Total RNA Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Samples were run on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred overnight to nylon filter. Cross-linking of the RNA to the nylon filter was done using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were probed for IL-8 mRNA expression and GAPDH mRNA (loading control) using randomly labeled probe (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 68 °C in Quickhyb (Stratagene) solution as recommended by the manufacturer. Washes were performed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 42 °C, and once with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 60 °C. Filters were exposed to film overnight. EA.hy926 endothelial cells were treated for 60 min with TNFα (5 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of thalidomide (40 μg/ml) or Me2SO (40 μl). Cells were scraped, and total RNA was harvested using Trizol solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using a custom made RiboquantTMMultiprobe RNase Protection Assay System (Pharmingen) containing a template of the NF-κB-responsive genes as follows: TRAF1, TRAF2, A1/Bfl-1, c-IAP2, IL-8, and IL-2Rα, RNAs were hybridized overnight and subjected to RNase treatment as recommended by the manufacturer. Annealed protected RNA products were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. 50 μg of cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked and probed for IκBα degradation using an antibody specific for IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To control for loading, the membranes were stripped and reprobed using an antibody for α-tubulin (Sigma). Cells were either not treated or treated with TNFα or TNFα plus thalidomide for specified times and harvested by centrifugation in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing phosphatase inhibitors (40Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (500 μg) of whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the β subunit of IKK (a gift of Dr. F. Mercurio, Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Kinase activity was determined by incubating the immunoprecipitates with 4 μg of GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) wild-type substrate or a mutated form of IκBα (S32T,S36T) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, as described previously (40Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, dried, and visualized by autoradiography. Autoradiographs were captured and stored for analysis using a gel capturing system that utilizes the NIH Image 1.61 software. Gel captures were quantified using volume quantitation and local median background correction using Molecular Dynamics ImagequaNTTM software program. Previous reports have provided evidence that thalidomide can inhibit the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (41Moreira A.L. Friedlander D.R. Shif B. Kaplan G. Zagzag D. J. Neuro-oncol. 1999; 43: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Moreira A.L. Corral L.G. Ye W. Johnson B. Stirling D. Muller G.W. Freedman V.H. Kaplan G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, these reports did not address whether the observed inhibition of DNA binding affected NF-κB transcriptional activity. Furthermore, the mechanism by which thalidomide suppresses NF-κB remains unknown. To gain insight into these unanswered questions, we first assayed NF-κB DNA binding activity in Jurkat T cells treated with both an inflammatory cytokine and thalidomide. We examined the potential effects of thalidomide treatment on NF-κB activation by stimulating cells with 10 ng/ml TNFα for 10 min in the presence or absence of thalidomide (Fig. 1 A). As expected, NF-κB was induced within 10 min after TNFα treatment as seen by increased DNA binding activity (Fig. 1 A, comparelanes 1 and 2). Based on the average of five independent experiments, TNFα-induced binding of NF-κB was inhibited by 62% when thalidomide was added to the cells simultaneously with cytokine treatment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6 and7) as measured by volume quantitation (see “Materials and Methods”). Treatment of cells with thalidomide (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and 5) or Me2SO alone (lane 3) had no effect on basal NF-κB DNA binding activity. Thalidomide treatment also had no inhibitory effect on the binding of a second transcription factor, Oct-1 (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, direct addition of thalidomide to TNFα-treated nuclear extracts did not affect the binding of NF-κB to the DNA (data not shown). These data indicate that suppression of NF-κB binding by thalidomide is not due to interference between the transcription factor and the DNA, but rather that thalidomide acts specifically to inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB activity and not as a general transcription factor inhibitor. Supershift assays indicate that the major NF-κB complex induced by TNFα stimulation was the p50-p65 heterodimer (Fig.1 C). To determine whether thalidomide could inhibit the induction of NF-κB by other stimuli, we tested its effect on NF-κB activation by the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Jurkat cells were treated with IL-1β in the absence or presence of thalidomide, and nuclear extracts were prepared from cells harvested at the specified time points (Fig.1 D). As seen with TNFα-thalidomide co-treatment, the presence of thalidomide at the time of IL-1β induction suppressed activation of NF-κB. We found both heterodimer and homodimer forms of NF-κB were inhibited at 10 and 20 min (Fig. 1 D, lanes 5and 7) post-induction but not at 5 min (Fig. 1 D, compare lanes 2 and 3). Supershift analysis exhibits authentic NF-κB complexes being induced following IL-1β treatment (Fig. 1 D, lanes 8 and 9). Overall, these data indicate that thalidomide can block NF-κB activation by cytokines that utilize distinct upstream signaling pathways, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression by thalidomide acts at a downstream site that is common to both the IL-1β and TNFα signaling cascades. To determine if thalidomide inhibited NF-κB transcriptional activity, we performed transient assays using a reporter plasmid containing multiple wild-type or mutated NF-κB-binding sites upstream of a luciferase gene. Jurkat cells were transfected with the reporter and were then treated with TNFα in the presence or absence of thalidomide for the times indicated (Fig.2). Treatment of cells with thalidomide at the time of TNFα induction led to a 1.7-fold increase in transcriptional activity of the wild-type reporter as compared with a 6-fold increase with TNFα alone (Fig. 2 A). The ability of thalidomide to inhibit the transcriptional induction by TNFα was transient, however, as suppression was partially lost at 9 h. This can be explained by the fact that thalidomide has a 4.5-h half-life in aqueous solutions (42Moreira A.L. Corral L.G. Ye W. Johnson B. Stirling D. Muller G.W. Freedman V.H. Kaplan G. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1997; 13: 857-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thalidomide did not block the activity of a reporter containing mutated NF-κB sites, indicating that the inhibition does not block general transcriptional responses (Fig.2 B). These results demonstrate that thalidomide not only acts to inhibit NF-κB DNA binding activity but also inhibits the ability of NF-κB to activate gene expression. Thalidomide is being used as a cancer therapy partly based on its ability to inhibit neovascularization (26D'Amato R.J. Loughnan M.S. Flynn E. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4082-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (2371) Google Scholar, 27Kenyon B.M. Browne F. D'Amato R.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 64: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Angiogenic factors such as IL-8 are transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, and TNFα-dependent angiogenesis requires the activation of NF-κB for the expression of IL-8 (28Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). We were interested in evaluating the effect of thalidomide on NF-κB in endothelial cells. To do this we assayed binding activity by utilizing EA.hy926 endothelial cells, a clonal cell line derived from the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (43Edgell C.J. McDonald C.C. Graham J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3734-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). We treated these cells with TNFα (5 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of thalidomide and analyzed nuclear extracts by EMSA (Fig. 3 A). As expected, TNFα treatment led to an increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity at 10 min (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). As seen previously with Jurkat T cells, thalidomide treatment of EA.hy926 cells at the time of induction inhibited this increase (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The major complex observed in TNFα activation of endothelial cells is the p50-p65 heterodimer as observed by the supershifted complexes (Fig.3 A, lanes 4 and 5). These results demonstrate that thalidomide is an effective inhibitor of inducible NF-κB activity in endothelial cells. The ability of thalidomide to inhibit NF-κB activation in Jurkat cells as well as endothelial cells indicates that the inhibitory action is not cell type-specific. Since thalidomide can inhibit activation of an NF-κB reporter gene, we sought to determine if it could inhibit the transcriptional activation of an endogenous NF-κB-regulated gene. Endothelial cells were treated with TNFα, with or without thalidomide exposure, and RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 B). TNFα treatment alone (lanes 3, 5, 7, and 9) increased the expression of IL-8 mRNA as compared with untreated cells (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2). However, thalidomide treatment inhibited the expression of IL-8 mRNA by 56% (as measured by volume quantitation) at 1 h (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). Treatment of the cells for longer time points inhibited the TNFα-induced activation of gene expression by ∼90% (lanes 6, 8 and 10) as compared with TNFα alone. Therefore, the ability of thalidomide to inhibit the binding activity of NF-κB, as seen by EMSA, correlates well with the inhibition of NF-κB-regulated endogenous gene expression at the 1-h time point but results in an even greater inhibition of gene expression at the 3–6-h time points. Development of angiogenesis in certain models is dependent on the expression of IL-8 (28Yoshida S. Ono M. Shono T. Izumi H. Ishibashi T. Suzuki H. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4015-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 44Koch A.E. Polverini P.J. Kunkel S.L. Harlow L.A. DiPietro L.A. Elner V.M. Elner S.G. Strieter R.M. Science. 1992; 258: 1798-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). Since IL-8 is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB and inhibited by thalidomide, we propose that one mechanism whereby thalidomide may function as an anti-angiogenic factor is through the suppression of NF-κB-regulated expression of IL-8 and potentially other angiogenic factors. NF-κB regulates genes involved in inflammatory responses as well as genes associated with the inhibition of apoptosis. The ability of thalidomide to function as an anti-inflammatory agent is likely due, in part, to its ability to block the induction of inflammatory gene expression through the inhibition of NF-κB. To test the effect thalidomide exposure has on the regulation of other NF-κB-dependent genes, we implemented a ribonuclease protection assay. By using an ribonuclease protection assay template specific for several NF-κB-regulated genes (Fig.4), we examined the effect of thalidomide treatment on NF-κB-dependent gene expression. RNA was harvested from untreated EA.hy926 endothelial cells, cells treated with TNFα, and cells co-treated with TNFα and thalidomide or Me2SO. The RNA was hybridized to the radioactively labeled,in vitro transcribed DNA template. As expected, TNFα induced the expression of several NF-κB-regulated genes (Fig.4 A, lane 2). Consistent with the ability of thalidomide to inhibit NF-κB DNA binding activity, thalidomide not only has the ability to inhibit TNFα-induced expression of IL-8 but can also inhibit the inducible expression of other NF-κB-regulated genes such as TRAF1, TRAF2, A1/Bfl-1, c-IAP2, and IL-2Rα(Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Treatment of cells with Me2SO in the presence of TNFα has no effect on gene expression (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). These data indicate that thalidomide blocks the TNFα-induced expression of several NF-κB-regulated genes. We have demonstrated that thalidomide can inhibit NF-κB activation in response to different cytokines that utilize distinct upstream pathways. This suggests that the inhibitory action of thalidomide on NF-κB binding lies downstream of the cytokine-receptor interaction and recruitment of associated factors but upstream of the induction of NF-κB nuclear translocation. Both TNFα and IL-1β signal NF-κB activation through the induction of IKK (30Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 45May M.J.

IKK activation results in the phosphorylation of IκBα on serine residues 32 and 36, which ultimately leads to the degradation of this inhibitor (49Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Semin.

Since thalidomide is capable of inhibiting DNA binding activity, as well as inhibiting the transcription potential of NF-κB, we performed Western blot analysis to determine what effect thalidomide has on the regulation of the NF-κB inhibitory protein, IκBα. Cytoplasmic extracts from cells treated with TNFα alone or in combination with thalidomide were examined for the presence of IκBα (Fig.5). Although untreated cells contain high levels of IκBα (lane 1), TNFα treatment resulted in the degradation of 85% (measured by volume quantitation) of the protein by 30 min following cytokine exposure (Fig. 5, lanes 2–4). This degradation was followed by an almost complete resynthesis of IκBα by 60 min (Fig. 5, lane 5). However, when thalidomide was present at the time of induction, IκBα degradation is suppressed to 45% by 30 min, leaving 65% of the protein intact even in the presence of a potent NF-κB activator (Fig.5, lanes 6–8). These data are consistent with the previous data on the ability of thalidomide to inhibit NF-κB binding as measured by EMSA. Moreover, no resynthesis of IκBα occurs at 60 min in the presence of thalidomide (Fig. 5, lane 9), unlike TNFα treatment alone. Since IκBα is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB, these data support the finding that thalidomide inhibits the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. To investigate the loss of IκBα degradation in the presence of thalidomide, we examined IKK activity following drug treatment. By using antibodies against the β subunit of the IKK complex, IKK was immunoprecipitated from extracts of cells that had been untreated or treated with TNFα or co-treated with thalidomide and TNFα. Immunoprecipitates were assayed for kinase activity by incubating with a GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) fusion protein in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, electrophoresed on a polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by autoradiography. TNFα treatment of cells leads to an increase in kinase activity by 5 min that continued through the 20-min time period. Quantitative analysis of TNFα-induced IKK activity demonstrated that thalidomide inhibited this increase in activity by 53% at the 10- (Fig. 6 A, lane 5) and 20-min time points (lane 7) as compared with TNFα alone (lanes 4 and 6). However, simultaneous treatment of cells with TNFα and thalidomide did not block the induction of IKK activity at 5 min (Fig. 6 A, lane 3). In contrast, addition of thalidomide to cells for 30 min prior to TNFα stimulation inhibited IKK activity at 5 min following cytokine exposure (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). This indicates that the lack of inhibition at the 5-min time point under simultaneous treatment conditions likely represents a lag period for the inhibitory activity of thalidomide. The lack of phosphorylation seen on a mutant GST-IκBα (S32T,S36T) substrate indicated that the phosphorylation activity of the kinase is specific for serine residues 32 and 36 (data not shown). The ability of thalidomide to inhibit IKK activity likely explains the suppression of NF-κB DNA binding and transcriptional activity. We propose that the inhibition of NF-κB by thalidomide also explains the anti-inflammatory and anti-oncogenic properties of thalidomide. It is possible there may be other mechanisms associated with thalidomide action that can block NF-κB activity on other levels. Thalidomide may inhibit another factor or signaling pathway that may be involved in inflammatory or oncogenic potential. For example, thalidomide has also been reported to block Sp1 DNA binding activity (41Moreira A.L. Friedlander D.R. Shif B. Kaplan G. Zagzag D. J. Neuro-oncol. 1999; 43: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that Sp1 and NF-κB can synergistically regulate transcription of certain genes (53Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, thalidomide may inhibit the expression of genes that are regulated by both Sp1 and NF-κB. It is certain that thalidomide can inhibit the ability of NF-κB to bind to the DNA. Our data demonstrate that thalidomide also functions to block the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Additionally, we show that thalidomide inhibits the phosphorylation of IκBα by altering IKK activity. In summary, the data indicate that NF-κB is a molecular target for thalidomide action, potentially serving as a unifying theme to explain the ability of thalidomide to suppress inflammatory responses as well as inhibit angiogenesis.

Here we report the crystal structure of a human Fc receptor (FcγRIIIB) in complex with an Fc fragment of human IgG1 determined from orthorhombic and hexagonal crystal forms at 3.0- and 3.5-Å resolution, respectively. The refined structures from the two crystal forms are nearly identical with no significant discrepancies between the coordinates.

An antibody-FcγRIII model suggests two possible ligand-induced receptor aggregations. Fc receptors for IgG and IgE of the immunoglobulin superfamily root mean square neonatal Fc receptor rheumatoid factors Fc receptors, which are expressed on the majority of hematopoietic cells, play important roles in antibody-mediated immune responses. The binding of antigen-bound immunoglobulins (Ig) to Fc receptors activates their effector functions and leads to phagocytosis, endocytosis of IgG-opsonized particles, as well as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. The three major types of Fc receptors are Fcγ, Fcε, and neonatal Fc receptors. Except for the neonatal Fc receptor and FcεRII (CD23), which are related structurally to class I major histocompatibility antigens and C-type lectins, respectively, all other known Fc receptors are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (1Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 2Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Among them, FcγRI and FcεRI1 are high affinity Fc receptors for IgG and IgE, respectively, with dissociation constants ranging from 10−8 to 10−10m. All other receptors for IgG, such as FcγRII and FcγRIII, are low affinity receptors with dissociation constants ranging from 10−5 to 10−7m (3Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 57: 1-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 4Galon J. Robertson M.W. Galinha A. Mazieres N. Spagnoli R. Fridman W.H. Sautes C. Eur. J.

Lett. 1999; 68: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition to variations in affinity, each receptor displays distinct IgG subtype specificities. Unlike the high affinity receptors that can bind monomeric antibodies, the low affinity receptors preferentially bind to and are activated by immune complexes. Human FcγRIII exists as two isoforms, FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIIB, that share 96% sequence identity in their extracellular immunoglobulin-binding regions. FcγRIIIA is expressed on macrophages, mast cells, and natural killer cells as a transmembrane receptor. In contrast, FcγRIIIB, present exclusively on neutrophils, is anchored by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linker to the plasma membrane. Although FcγRIIIA associates with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif containing FcεRI γ-chain or the T cell receptor ζ-chain for its signaling, FcγRIIIB lacks a signaling component. Nevertheless, it plays an active role in triggering Ca2+mobilization and in neutrophil degranulation (6Kimberly R.P. Ahlstrom J.W. Click M.E. Edberg J.C. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1239-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Unkeless J.C. Shen Z. Lin C.W. DeBeus E. Semin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, FcγRIIIB, in conjunction with FcγRIIA, activates phagocytosis, degranulation, and the oxidative burst that leads to the clearance of opsonized pathogens by neutrophils. A soluble form of FcγRIIIB was reported to activate the CR3 complement receptor-dependent inflammatory process (8Galon J. Gauchat J.F. Mazieres N. Spagnoli R. Storkus W. Lotze M. Bonnefoy J.Y. Fridman W.H. Sautes C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1184-1192PubMed Google Scholar). The Fc binding region on FcγRII and FcγRIII has been identified through the work of chimeric receptors with FcεRI as primarily the membrane proximal domain, including both the BC and FG loops. Further site-directed mutations have revealed several residues of the receptor critical to Fc binding (9Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol.

Similar regions on the α-chain of FcεRI were also identified to be critical for IgE binding affinity (12Cook J.P. Henry A.J. McDonnell J.M. Owens R.J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15579-15588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The receptor binding site on Fc has been located through the construction of chimeric IgG molecules and mutational analysis at the lower hinge region, residues located in the hinge region between the CH1 and CH2 domains and immediately adjacent to the N terminus of the CH2 domain of IgG (13Chappel M.S.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 2657-2662PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, residues 234–238 (Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Pro) of the lower hinge of IgG1 have been implicated in the receptor binding. The corresponding region of IgE has also been implicated in the FcεRI binding (16Henry A.J. Cook J.P. McDonnell J.M. Mackay G.A. Shi J. Sutton B.J. Gould H.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15568-15578Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Apart from the lower hinge region, a few residues on the CH2 domain of an IgG2b were also suggested to interact with the receptor (17Kato K. Sautes-Fridman C. Yamada W. Kobayashi K. Uchiyama S.

However, with the exception of the neonatal Fc receptor, the molecular recognition between the Fc receptors and Fc remains to be elucidated (18Burmeister W.P. Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Blum M.L. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structures of FcεRIα, FcγRIIA, and FcγRIIB have each revealed a conserved Ig-like structure, with particularly the small hinge angle between the two Ig-like domains, which is unique to the Fc receptors (19Garman S.C.

We report here the crystal structure of a human FcγRIII in complex with the Fc portion of a human IgG1 determined from two crystal forms. The extracellular part of the human FcγRIIIb receptor, residues 1–172, was expressed as Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and then reconstituted in vitro as described previously (22Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.-H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Fc fragments of human IgG1 antibody were prepared by the papain digestion as previously reported (23Kato K. Matsunaga C. Igarashi T. Kim H. Odaka A. Shimada I. Arata Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Kato K. Matsunaga C. Odaka A. Yamato S. Takaha W. Shimada I. Arata Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6604-6610Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complex of Fc and FcγRIII was prepared by mixing both components in a 1:1 molar ratio and concentrating to 8–15 mg/ml for crystallization. Single crystals of orthorhombic and hexagonal forms were obtained by vapor diffusion in hanging drops at room temperature under slightly different crystallization conditions. Rod-shaped crystals of the orthorhombic form were grown from 10% polyethylene glycol 4000 and 50 mm Hepes at pH 6.5. They appeared after 2–3 days and grew to an average size of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.2 mm in ∼2 weeks. Crystals of the second form, hexagonal bipyramids, were crystallized from 5% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 50 mm Hepes at pH 6.0. Crystals were first observed after 4–5 days, and reached a maximum size 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.4 mm after 1 month. After briefly soaking in precipitant solutions containing 25% glycerol, crystals were flash frozen at 100 K. X-ray diffraction data from single crystals of both crystal forms were collected using an ADSC Quantum IV charge-coupled device detector at the X9B beam line of the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory and processed with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The hexagonal crystals belong to space groupP6522 with cell dimensions a =b = 114.9 and c = 301.4 Å and diffract to 3.5 Å. Due to the large unit cell dimension along c in the hexagonal crystals, data were collected at a 300-mm crystal to detector distance with a small oscillation angle of 0.2°. The orthorhombic crystals of space groupP212121 with cell dimensions of a = 76.4, b = 102.8, andc = 123.3 Å diffracted to 3.0 Å. Both crystal forms contain one molecule of FcγRIII and one molecule of Fc in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the FcγRIII·Fc complex in both crystal forms was determined by molecular replacement. Polyalanine models of Fc (PDB accession number 1FC1) and FcγRIII were used in rotation and translation searches using 15-4 Å data for both crystal forms. An I/ς(I) cutoff of 2.0 was used for hexagonal data during search procedures. The position of the Fc molecule was determined in both crystal forms using AmoRe (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Rotation and translation searches using data from the orthorhombic crystal resulted in an unambiguous solution with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 39% and an R-factor (RF) of 51% (CC = 51% and RF = 49% after rigid-body refinement in AmoRe). Molecular replacement searches using the hexagonal crystal data yielded a solution for the Fc from the third highest rotation solution that became the highest ranking translation solution with CC = 38% and RF = 52% (CC = 46% andRF = 50% after rigid-body refinement in AmoRe). The position of FcγRIII was determined in both crystal forms using the program EPMR (27Kissinger C.R. Gehlhaar D.K. Fogel D.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) with a polyalanine model of FcγRIII and the position of the Fc molecule fixed. Clear solutions were obtained for both crystal forms with CC = 56% and RF = 48% for orthorhombic crystal and CC = 55% and RF = 48% for hexagonal crystal, respectively. After rigid-body refinement of individual domains of the FcγRIII·Fc complex modeled as polyalanine using CNS (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Disordered side chains lacking electron density were built with occupancies set to zero. The positional and grouped B-factor refinement was carried out using maximum likelihood as a target function with CNS version 0.9. Model adjustments and rebuilding were done using the program O (29Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate molecules were added manually using 2Fo− Fc electron density maps contoured at 1.0ς and refined. The final model includes residues 5–172 of FcγRIII, residues 235–444 for one chain of Fc, and residues 233–443 for the other chain of Fc. Crystals of a human FcγRIII receptor in complex with a human Fc fragment of IgG1 were grown in two forms under different conditions. The orthorhombic crystals belong to the space group ofP212121 and diffract to 3.0-Å resolution, whereas the hexagonal crystals haveP6522 space group symmetry and diffract to 3.5-Å resolution. The structure of the complex was determined by molecular replacement in both forms and refined to their resolution limit. The final R-factors are Rcryst= 23.0% and Rfree = 28.9% for the orthorhombic form and Rcryst = 24.9% andRfree = 32.6% for the hexagonal form, respectively (Table I). The electron density is continuous throughout the complex in the final 2Fo − Fc map except for three surface loops of FcγRIII (residues 31–34, 99–105, and 142–149) located opposite from the Fc interface region. Despite different crystal packing and solvent contents (57% in the orthorhombic and 64% in the hexagonal form), both crystals contain one FcγRIII and one Fc molecule in each asymmetric unit, suggesting a 1:1 stoichiometry for the binding between the receptor and Fc (Fig.1). This is consistent with earlier binding studies using non-equilibrium and equilibrium gel filtration experiments (22Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.-H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 375-387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The conformation of the FcγRIII·Fc complex is essentially identical in both crystal forms, including the conformation of the visible carbohydrate moieties on the Fc fragment (Fig.2A).Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData collectionOrthorhombic formHexagonal formCrystal 1Crystal 2Space groupP212121P212121P6522Unit cell parameters (Å)a = 73.8a = 76.4a = b = 114.9b = 102.4b = 102.8c = 301.4c = 123.1c = 123.3Resolution limit (Å)3.03.33.5Unique reflections19063 (1859)1-aValues for highest resolution shells, 3.00–3.11 and 3.30–3.44 Å for orthorhombic and 3.50–3.60 Å for hexagonal forms, are given in parentheses.13216 (1286)15541 (1511)Redundancy4.8 (4.6)3.0 (2.8)4.7 (4.8)Completeness (%)99.9 (99.8)86.4 (86.1)98.7 (99.4)Rsym(%)1-bRsym = 100 × Σ‖Ih− 〈Ih〉‖/ΣIh, where 〈Ih〉 is the mean intensity of multiple measurements of symmetry equivalent reflections.6.1 (46.0)12.5 (46.5)8.7 (42.3)I/ς(I)21.4 (3.6)9.7 (2.5)20.2 (4.0)RefinementResolution (Å)10–3.010–3.310–3.5No. reflections177801194814032No. nonhydrogen atoms472247334712No. atoms in carbohydrate moieties202195149Rcryst(%)23.0 (39.3)23.5 (31.3)24.9 (36.5)Rfree(%)1-cRfree is calculated using test set of 5% of the reflections for the orthorhombic and 3% for hexagonal data sets.28.9 (50.8)27.4 (36.5)32.6 (47.7)Mean B-factor (Å2)814167Wilson B-factor (Å2)825482r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.0110.0080.009r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.821.511.691-a Values for highest resolution shells, 3.00–3.11 and 3.30–3.44 Å for orthorhombic and 3.50–3.60 Å for hexagonal forms, are given in parentheses.1-b Rsym = 100 × Σ‖Ih− 〈Ih〉‖/ΣIh, where 〈Ih〉 is the mean intensity of multiple measurements of symmetry equivalent reflections.1-c Rfree is calculated using test set of 5% of the reflections for the orthorhombic and 3% for hexagonal data sets.

The hinge angle between the N-terminal (D1) and the C-terminal (D2) domains is 60°, which is slightly larger than the 50° value observed in the ligand free receptor. However, no significant change in the receptor conformation is observed upon complex formation (Fig. 2B). The Fc fragment of an IgG1 antibody comprises two identical chains (A and B), and each consists of two C1-type immunoglobulin domains, CH2 and CH3. The overall shape of the Fc fragment resembles that of a horseshoe with the two CH3 domains packing tightly against each other at the bottom of the horseshoe and the CH2 domains held apart by carbohydrate moieties attached to the glycosylation site Asn297 from both chains forming the opening of the horseshoe. Well defined electron density throughout the Fc allowed for unambiguous tracing of residues Leu234 to Ser444 in chain A and Pro232 to Leu443 in chain B of Fc, including the lower hinge regions, Leu234–Pro238. The structure of the Fc fragment in complex with FcγRIII does not differ significantly from that observed in the structures of an unbound Fc fragment and a murine intact IgG2a antibody (30Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar, 31Harris L.J. Larson S.B. Hasel K.W. Day J. Greenwood A. McPherson A. Nature. 1992; 360: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). However, the 2-fold symmetry relating the two chains of Fc in other unligated Fc structures, is no longer retained in the structure of the complex. The horseshoe-shaped Fc is slightly more open at the N-terminal end of the CH2 domains in the FcγRIII·Fc structure compared with other known structures of Fc. The hinge angle between CH2 and CH3 domains of chain A (Fc-A) is 95° and 100° in the orthorhombic and the hexagonal crystals, respectively, ∼10° larger than the corresponding angle of chain B (Fc-B) and the 84°–89° angle observed in all structures of ligand-free Fc (Fig.2C). The receptor binds to Fc at the center of the horseshoe opening making contacts to the lower hinge regions of both A and B chains of Fc (designated here as Hinge-A and Hinge-B, respectively, for the lower hinges of Fc-A and Fc-B) (Fig.1). Such binding breaks down the dyad symmetry of the Fc, creating an asymmetric interface whereby the identical residues from Hinge-A and Hinge-B interact with different, unrelated surfaces of the receptor. Furthermore, it excludes the possibility of having a second receptor interacting with the same Fc molecule, resulting in a 1:1 stoichiometry for the receptor·Fc recognition. The structural implications of the activation of Fc receptors is profound. Particularly, the 1:1 receptor·Fc binding stoichiometry highlights the importance of antigen in the receptor aggregation. In contrast to the high affinity FcγRI and FcεRI receptors, the binding of immunoglobulins to FcγRIII in the absence of antigen does not lead to receptor aggregation. It can be argued that a 1:1 receptor-ligand stoichiometry ensures the need for antigens in forming the receptor aggregation by eliminating the possibility of Fc-mediated receptor aggregation as suggested in a 2:1 stoichiometry. Precluding receptor aggregation mediated by Fc alone also eliminates the potential deleterious effect of antibodies whose concentration in vivo are often much higher than that of antigen. The receptor·Fc complex buries ∼1453 Å2 of solvent-accessible area (Fig.3A). The interface between FcγRIII and Fc molecules shows poor shape complementarity with a mean shape correlation statistic of 0.53 (32Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), less than those between T-cell antigen receptor and Class I major histocompatibility complex molecules, between adhesion receptor CD2 and CD58, and between antibody and antigen complexes. On the receptor side, all the contacts to Fc are made exclusively through its D2 domain. The receptor D1 domain is positioned above the Fc-B and makes no contacts with Fc (Fig.1A). The interface of the complex consists of the hinge loop between the D1 and D2 domain of the receptor, the BC, C′E, and FG loops, and the C′ β-strand. The BC loop is positioned across the horseshoe opening making contact with residues of both Hinge-A and Hinge-B. The C′-strand is situated atop the Fc-A leading to the C′E loop in contact with residues of Hinge-A. The FG loop of FcγRIII protrudes into the opening between the two chains of Fc (Fig.1A). All three receptor loops (BC, C′E, and FG) were implicated in Fc binding through earlier studies of chimeric FcγRII/FcεRI receptors and through site-directed mutagenesis (9Hulett M.D. Witort E.

On the Fc side of the complex, interactions with the receptor are dominated by residues Leu234-Pro238 of the lower hinge (Table II), consistent with results form earlier mutational studies (2Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In particular, Hinge-A and -B together contribute ∼60% of the overall receptor·Fc interface area (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, both Hinge-A and -B are found disordered in all known Fc structures to date, including the structure of an intact mouse IgG2a (30Deisenhofer J.

In contrast, residues of both Hinge-A and -B are clearly visible in the electron density maps from both crystal forms, suggesting that the binding of FcγRIII stabilizes the lower hinge conformation of Fc.Table IIInterface contacts between FcγRIII and FcFcγRIIIFcChainDistance (Å)Hydrogen bonds and salt bridgesThr116Oγ1Leu235 OB3.3Lys120NζSer239 OγA3.4Lys120NζAsp265 Oδ1A3.2Lys120NζGly237 OA3.4His134Nδ2Gly236 OA3.5His134 Nε2Gly237 OA2.4His135Nε2Leu235 OA3.2Val158OGly236 NB3.5Lys161NζGly236 OB3.0Hydrophobic contacts2-aCarbon-carbon contacts ≤ 4.0 Å.Ile88Ala330BTrp90Pro329, Gly236BTrp113Pro329BHis134Gly236, Gly237, Asp265AVal158Leu235BGly159Leu235BLys161Gly236B2-a Carbon-carbon contacts ≤ 4.0 Å. Open table in a new tab A combination of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions contributes to the receptor·Fc recognition. Specifically, the interface between FcγRIII and Fc-A is dominated by hydrogen bonding interactions, whereas the hydrophobic interactions occur primarily at the interface between FcγRIII and Fc-B. There are a total of nine hydrogen bonds between the receptor and Fc, forming an extensive network involving both the main-chain and side-chain hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3, B and C, and TableII). Seven hydrogen bonds are distributed across the receptor and Fc-A interface and two are at the receptor and Fc-B interface. Alanine mutations, such as the H134A mutant of FcγRII that resulted in the loss of two interface hydrogen bonds, have been shown to reduce the receptor·Fc binding drastically, illustrating the importance of the interface hydrogen bonding network to the stability of the complex (10Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21188-21194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A hydrophobic core is formed between Trp90, Trp113 of the receptor, and Pro329 of the CH2 domain of Fc-B (Fig. 3C). This hydrophobic core extends further to include Val158, the aliphatic side chain of Lys161 of the receptor and Leu235 of Hinge-B. Mutations of both Trp113 and Lys161 in FcγRIII lead to the loss in receptor function (11Tamm A. Kister A. Nolte K.U. Gessner J.E. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Hibbs M.L. Tolvanen M. Carpen O. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4466-4474PubMed Google Scholar). The side chain of Leu235 on the Fc-B packs tightly against Gly159 of the receptor leaving little space to accommodate any residues larger than Gly at this position. A G159A mutation on chimeric FcγRII resulted in the complete disruption of Fc binding, presumably due to the steric hindrance between Leu235 and the β-carbon of the alanine mutant at position 159 (9Hulett M.D. Witort E. Brinkworth R.I. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15287-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of particular interest is Trp113 of the receptor, which when mutated to Phe resulted in the loss of Fc binding. This residue is not only part of the interface hydrophobic core but also functions as a wedge inserted into the D1 domain to stabilize the acute inter-domain hinge angle between D1 and D2 domains of FcγRIII. A W113F mutation would result in the loss of this wedge and lead to a disruption in binding by altering the orientation between the D1 and D2 domains. Including the two crystal forms described in this work, there are a total of four Fc receptor and Fc complex structures available to date. A comparison among these structures reveals the conformation flexibility of this receptor·ligand complex and helps to explain the molecular interactions that differentiate the high from the low affinity receptors. The two crystal forms of FcγRIII·Fc complexes determined in the present study are essentially identical and can be readily superimposed with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations of 1.1 Å among all Cα atoms. The superposition of the hexagonal form onto the published FcγRIII·Fc complex resulted in an r.m.s deviation of 0.5 Å for all Cα atoms (37Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U.

Today glutaredoxins are known as a multifunctional family of GSH-disulfide-oxidoreductases belonging to the thioredoxin fold superfamily. In contrast to Escherichia coli and yeast, a single human glutaredoxin is known. We have identified and cloned a novel 18-kDa human dithiol glutaredoxin, named glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2), which is 34% identical to the previously known cytosolic 12-kDa human Grx1. The human Grx2 sequence contains three characteristic regions of the glutaredoxin family: the dithiol/disulfide active site, CSYC, the GSH binding site, and a hydrophobic surface area. The human Grx2 gene, located at chromosome 1q31.2--31.3, consisted of five exons that were transcribed to a 0.9-kilobase human Grx2 mRNA ubiquitously expressed in several tissues. Two alternatively spliced Grx2 mRNA isoforms that differed in their 5' region were identified. These corresponded to alternative proteins with a common 125-residue C-terminal Grx domain but with different N-terminal extensions of 39 and 40 residues, respectively. The 125-residue Grx domain and the two full-length variants were expressed in E. coli and exhibited GSH-dependent hydroxyethyl disulfide and dehydroascorbate reducing activities. Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions from Jurkat cells with a specific anti-Grx2 antibody showed that human Grx2 was predominantly located in the nucleus but also present in the mitochondria. We further showed that one of the mRNA isoforms corresponding to Grx2a encoded a functional N-terminal mitochondrial translocation signal."

PDGF-C is a multidomain protein with the N-terminal region homologous to the extracellular CUB domain of neuropilin-1, and the C-terminal region consists of a growth factor domain (GFD) with homology to vascular endothelial growth factor (25%) and PDGF A-chain (23%). A serum-sensitive cleavage site between the two domains allows release of the GFD from the CUB domain. Competition binding and immunoprecipitation studies on cells bearing both PDGF α and β receptors reveal a high affinity binding of recombinant GFD (PDGF-CC) to PDGF receptor-α homodimers and PDGF receptor-α/β heterodimers. PDGF-CC exhibits greater mitogenic potency than PDGF-AA and comparable or greater mitogenic activity than PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB on several mesenchymal cell types.

During the past 15 years, however, the PDGF family has remained unchanged in size, consisting of two members, PDGF-A and -B, that are able to form three dimeric structures, AA, AB, and BB. All three forms of PDGF have been identified in natural sources and have been shown to possess biological activity (10Stroopbant P. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Heldin C.H. Johnsson A. Wennergren S. Wernstedt C. Betsholtz C. Westermark B.

PDGFR-α binds both PDGF A- and B-chains, whereas the PDGFR-β binds only PDGF B-chain (12Hart C.E. Forstrom J.W. Kelly J.D. Seifert R.A Smith R.A. Ross R. Murray M.J. Bowen-Pope D.F.

Dimerization of the receptors is required for high affinity binding such that α/α homodimerization is induced by PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB; α/β heterodimerization is induced by PDGF-AB and -BB, and β/β homodimerization is induced only by BB. Thus, the response of a given cell type to the different forms of PDGF is dependent on the relative abundance of each of the PDGF receptors (14Hart C.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Invest Dermatol. 1990; 94 Suppl. 6: 53S-57SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In this report we describe the characterization of a new member of the PDGF family, PDGF-C. This protein is a multidomain protein requiring enzymatic activation to release a C-terminal domain with potent biological activity. A recent article by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) describes this same protein and reports that PDGF-CC binds only to PDGFR-α, giving a binding profile that is similar to PDGF-AA. In the studies reported here, we extend the data for this ligand, demonstrating direct binding of PDGF-CC to PDGFR-β in cells co-expressing PDGFR-α. Thus the binding specificity indicated for PDGF-CC gives it a profile similar to PDGF-AB. Distinct differences in biological activity associated with binding to α/α and α/β receptors have been reported (16Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 201-216Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). On vascular smooth muscle cells, PDGF-AB and -BB binding to α/β receptors is associated with stimulation of chemotaxis, whereas PDGF-AA binding to α receptor is associated with inhibition of chemotaxis. In wound healing processes, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB are significantly more potent than PDGF-AA in the enhancement of granulation tissue formation (17Lepistö P. Peltonen J. Vähä-Kreula M. Söderström K.-O. Niinikoski J. Laato M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).We believe the identification of the expanded receptor binding properties of PDGF-C will be critical in understanding the biology of this new member of the PDGF family as well as providing new ways of assessing PDGF biology.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a third member of the PDGF ligand family using a homology-based computational algorithm. This molecule, labeled PDGF-C (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), is a multidomain protein with a C-terminal domain capable of binding to and activating PDGF receptors. The data presented here demonstrate that PDGF-CC binds with high affinity to PDGFR-α/α homodimers and PDGFR-α/β heterodimers but not PDGFR-β/β homodimers. Thus, PDGF-CC has a binding phenotype similar to that of PDGF-AB, the ability to bind to α/α homodimers and α/β heterodimers. The ability to bind to the β receptor is supported by several lines of evidence including the ability of β receptor blocking antibodies to decrease the binding of PDGF-CC, the ability to immunoprecipitate PDGF-CC when complexed to PDGFR-β, and the ability of PDGF-CC to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β. These studies were all conducted with cells that expressed both PDGFR-α and -β. For cells that expressed PDGFR-β only, there was no evidence for high affinity PDGF-CC binding to PDGFR-β.The finding that PDGF-CC binds to both α/α and α/β receptor complexes is critical to the elucidation of the biology associated with this protein. If PDGF-CC binds only to α/α receptor complexes, as suggested by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), then it would be expected that PDGF-CC would have properties similar to PDGF-AA. In contrast, the ability of PDGF-CC to bind to α/α and α/β receptor complexes gives it a binding profile similar to PDGF-AB. The extension of the receptor binding data for PDGF-CC presented in this study is important to understand the biology of this molecule as it is well documented that PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB have unique biological properties.Studying mesangial cells, Abboud et al. (36Abboud H.E. Grandaliano G. Pinzani M. Knauss T. Pierce G.F. Jaffer F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PDGF-AB induced increase in DNA synthesis, activation of phospholipase C, and autoinduction of PDGF A- and B-chain mRNAs, whereas PDGF-AA lacked these effects. Rupp et al. (37Rupp E. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using endothelial cells transfected with both PDGFR-α and -β at similar levels, demonstrated that PDGF-AB, but not PDGF-AA, stimulated actin reorganization and chemotaxis and that PDGF-AB was more potent than PDGF-AA at stimulating DNA synthesis. Koyama et al.(22Koyama N. Hart C.E. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) similarly reported that PDGF-AB stimulates chemotactic activity on vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas PDGF-AA has no stimulatory effect. Studying the in vivo effects of PDGFs, Lepistöet al. (17Lepistö P. Peltonen J. Vähä-Kreula M. Söderström K.-O. Niinikoski J. Laato M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PDGF-AB elicited a more potent granulation response in cellulose sponges implanted into rats than PDGF-AA. The increased potency of PDGF-AB over PDGF-AA described in the above studies is consistent with the increase in mitogenic activity we observed for PDGF-CC as compared with PDGF-AA in this paper.The expression of PDGF-C in BHK-570 cells suggests that cells produce it as a full-length molecule. Whereas PDGF A- and B-chains have a dibasic cleavage site adjacent to their GFDs, similar to PDGF-C, cleavage at these sites occurs within the cell, such that only the separated GFD is secreted from the cell (reviewed in Ref. 39Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Westermark B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of PDGF-C in BHK-570 cells suggests that the cell secretes the full-length molecule. In our studies the cleavage of PDGF-C appears to be sensitive to as yet unidentified serum factors. Liet al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) have reported that PDGF-C can be cleaved by plasmin to release the GFD. Our data further demonstrate that PDGF-C is produced as a homodimer in culture and that both the full-length protein and the GFD version can form homodimers when expressed as recombinant proteins. Given the presence of a large N-terminal CUB domain, it seems unlikely that PDGF-CC forms heterodimers with PDGF A- or B-chain polypeptides.The multidomain structure of PDGF-C is unique within the PDGF family. Although the GFD has potent biological activity, as demonstrated in the aortic ring assay, [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, and in vivo wound healing, the function of the CUB domain remains to be determined. It is important to note that the CUB domain has homology to neuropilin-1, a cell-surface glycoprotein initially identified in Xenopus tadpole nervous tissues (40Takagi S. Tsuji T. Amagai T. Takamatsu T. Fujisawa H. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H.

Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar, 43Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier L.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1 has also been shown to play a role in regulating neurite outgrowth via its interactions with semaphorins (44Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The CUB domain of PDGF-C may act as a targeting domain for the full-length protein by binding to cell-surface molecules, potentially semaphorins. PDGF-C is then locally cleaved to release the GFD by as yet unidentified serum factors. The released GFD is then available to bind and activate the PDGF receptors. This scheme provides for the accumulation of PDGF-C at localized sites without the release of the active GFD until such time as local environmental events cause the release of active protein. This model requires that full-length PDGF-C does not bind to the PDGF receptors or, if it does, is not capable of stimulating receptor activation. Results reported by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) support this conclusion. In all cases where we have expressed full-length protein, there is always some limited amount of cleaved product generated. As such, it has not been possible to determine whether the full-length protein or the cleaved portion of the molecule is interacting with the PDGF receptors.In addition to expanding the binding model of PDGF/receptor interaction, the structure of PDGF-C creates additional possibilities for in vivo PDGF function. PDGF-A and -B are made by epithelial and endothelial cells in order to recruit mesenchymal cells bearing PDGF receptors during development (38Hellström M. Kalén M. Lindahl P. Abramsson A. Betsholtz C. Development. 1999; 126: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Ansel J.C. Tiesman J.P. Olerud J.E. Krueger J.G. Krane J.F. Tara D.C. Shipley G.D. Gilbertson D. Usui M.L. Hart C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Human platelets release all three forms of PDGF at sites of vascular damage, recruiting smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts to the wound site. It is intriguing to speculate that mesenchymal cells are not always forced to rely on other cell types for proliferative stimulus but may also synthesize a potent form of PDGF (PDGF-C) sequestered in the tissues until specific proteolytic enzymes coupled to trauma or regenerative processes release the active GFD from the inactive pro-form. The generalized expression of PDGF-C on multiple tissue Northerns (Fig. 2 A) and in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B) is consistent with this notion. It is possible that PDGF-C is a primary source of PDGF-like wound healing activity in somatic tissues and that the PDGF is synthesized and released by the responding cell types. Inappropriate activation of the pro-form may thus also lead to diseases characterized by proliferation of connective tissues.Clearly the analysis of historical data and activities attributed to the various members of the PDGF ligand family need to be reconsidered in a new light. The identification of a new member adds to the already complex nature of this ligand/receptor family. Further elucidation of PDGF-C activities will begin to clarify its true level of involvement in regulating the multitude of activities previously attributed to the known PDGF family members. As a result of the increased bioinformatics effort to analyze the rapidly expanding expressed sequence tag (EST)1 and genomic sequence data bases, many families of growth factors have experienced a rapid increase in members, including the fibroblast growth factor (1Szebenyi G.

During the past 15 years, however, the PDGF family has remained unchanged in size, consisting of two members, PDGF-A and -B, that are able to form three dimeric structures, AA, AB, and BB. All three forms of PDGF have been identified in natural sources and have been shown to possess biological activity (10Stroopbant P. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2963-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 11Heldin C.H. Johnsson A. Wennergren S. Wernstedt C. Betsholtz C. Westermark B.

Science. 1988; 240: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Two PDGF receptors have also been identified, PDGF-α receptor (PDGFR-α) and PDGF-β receptor (PDGFR-β), that demonstrate differential binding specificity for the two PDGF chains. PDGFR-α binds both PDGF A- and B-chains, whereas the PDGFR-β binds only PDGF B-chain (12Hart C.E. Forstrom J.W. Kelly J.D. Seifert R.A Smith R.A. Ross R. Murray M.J. Bowen-Pope D.F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 8771-8778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of the receptors is required for high affinity binding such that α/α homodimerization is induced by PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB; α/β heterodimerization is induced by PDGF-AB and -BB, and β/β homodimerization is induced only by BB. Thus, the response of a given cell type to the different forms of PDGF is dependent on the relative abundance of each of the PDGF receptors (14Hart C.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Invest Dermatol. 1990; 94 Suppl. 6: 53S-57SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this report we describe the characterization of a new member of the PDGF family, PDGF-C. This protein is a multidomain protein requiring enzymatic activation to release a C-terminal domain with potent biological activity. A recent article by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) describes this same protein and reports that PDGF-CC binds only to PDGFR-α, giving a binding profile that is similar to PDGF-AA. In the studies reported here, we extend the data for this ligand, demonstrating direct binding of PDGF-CC to PDGFR-β in cells co-expressing PDGFR-α. Thus the binding specificity indicated for PDGF-CC gives it a profile similar to PDGF-AB. Distinct differences in biological activity associated with binding to α/α and α/β receptors have been reported (16Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1998; 16: 201-216Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). On vascular smooth muscle cells, PDGF-AB and -BB binding to α/β receptors is associated with stimulation of chemotaxis, whereas PDGF-AA binding to α receptor is associated with inhibition of chemotaxis. In wound healing processes, PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB are significantly more potent than PDGF-AA in the enhancement of granulation tissue formation (17Lepistö P. Peltonen J. Vähä-Kreula M. Söderström K.-O. Niinikoski J. Laato M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We believe the identification of the expanded receptor binding properties of PDGF-C will be critical in understanding the biology of this new member of the PDGF family as well as providing new ways of assessing PDGF biology. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a third member of the PDGF ligand family using a homology-based computational algorithm. This molecule, labeled PDGF-C (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), is a multidomain protein with a C-terminal domain capable of binding to and activating PDGF receptors. The data presented here demonstrate that PDGF-CC binds with high affinity to PDGFR-α/α homodimers and PDGFR-α/β heterodimers but not PDGFR-β/β homodimers. Thus, PDGF-CC has a binding phenotype similar to that of PDGF-AB, the ability to bind to α/α homodimers and α/β heterodimers. The ability to bind to the β receptor is supported by several lines of evidence including the ability of β receptor blocking antibodies to decrease the binding of PDGF-CC, the ability to immunoprecipitate PDGF-CC when complexed to PDGFR-β, and the ability of PDGF-CC to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR-β. These studies were all conducted with cells that expressed both PDGFR-α and -β. For cells that expressed PDGFR-β only, there was no evidence for high affinity PDGF-CC binding to PDGFR-β.The finding that PDGF-CC binds to both α/α and α/β receptor complexes is critical to the elucidation of the biology associated with this protein. If PDGF-CC binds only to α/α receptor complexes, as suggested by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), then it would be expected that PDGF-CC would have properties similar to PDGF-AA. In contrast, the ability of PDGF-CC to bind to α/α and α/β receptor complexes gives it a binding profile similar to PDGF-AB. The extension of the receptor binding data for PDGF-CC presented in this study is important to understand the biology of this molecule as it is well documented that PDGF-AA and PDGF-AB have unique biological properties.Studying mesangial cells, Abboud et al. (36Abboud H.E. Grandaliano G. Pinzani M. Knauss T. Pierce G.F. Jaffer F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PDGF-AB induced increase in DNA synthesis, activation of phospholipase C, and autoinduction of PDGF A- and B-chain mRNAs, whereas PDGF-AA lacked these effects. Rupp et al. (37Rupp E. Siegbahn A. Rönnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), using endothelial cells transfected with both PDGFR-α and -β at similar levels, demonstrated that PDGF-AB, but not PDGF-AA, stimulated actin reorganization and chemotaxis and that PDGF-AB was more potent than PDGF-AA at stimulating DNA synthesis. Koyama et al.(22Koyama N. Hart C.E. Clowes A.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) similarly reported that PDGF-AB stimulates chemotactic activity on vascular smooth muscle cells, whereas PDGF-AA has no stimulatory effect. Studying the in vivo effects of PDGFs, Lepistöet al. (17Lepistö P. Peltonen J. Vähä-Kreula M. Söderström K.-O. Niinikoski J. Laato M. Cell Tissue Res. 1996; 286: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PDGF-AB elicited a more potent granulation response in cellulose sponges implanted into rats than PDGF-AA. The increased potency of PDGF-AB over PDGF-AA described in the above studies is consistent with the increase in mitogenic activity we observed for PDGF-CC as compared with PDGF-AA in this paper.The expression of PDGF-C in BHK-570 cells suggests that cells produce it as a full-length molecule. Whereas PDGF A- and B-chains have a dibasic cleavage site adjacent to their GFDs, similar to PDGF-C, cleavage at these sites occurs within the cell, such that only the separated GFD is secreted from the cell (reviewed in Ref. 39Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Westermark B. Growth Factors. 1993; 8: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of PDGF-C in BHK-570 cells suggests that the cell secretes the full-length molecule. In our studies the cleavage of PDGF-C appears to be sensitive to as yet unidentified serum factors. Liet al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) have reported that PDGF-C can be cleaved by plasmin to release the GFD. Our data further demonstrate that PDGF-C is produced as a homodimer in culture and that both the full-length protein and the GFD version can form homodimers when expressed as recombinant proteins. Given the presence of a large N-terminal CUB domain, it seems unlikely that PDGF-CC forms heterodimers with PDGF A- or B-chain polypeptides.The multidomain structure of PDGF-C is unique within the PDGF family. Although the GFD has potent biological activity, as demonstrated in the aortic ring assay, [3H]thymidine incorporation studies, and in vivo wound healing, the function of the CUB domain remains to be determined. It is important to note that the CUB domain has homology to neuropilin-1, a cell-surface glycoprotein initially identified in Xenopus tadpole nervous tissues (40Takagi S. Tsuji T. Amagai T. Takamatsu T. Fujisawa H. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 41Takagi S. Hirata T. Agata K. Mochii M. Eguchi G. Fujisawa H.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Neuropilin-1 has also been shown to play a role in regulating neurite outgrowth via its interactions with semaphorins (44Kitsukawa T. Shimizu M. Sanbo M. Hirata T. Taniguchi M. Bekku Y. Yagi T. Fujisawa H. Neuron. 1997; 19: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The CUB domain of PDGF-C may act as a targeting domain for the full-length protein by binding to cell-surface molecules, potentially semaphorins. PDGF-C is then locally cleaved to release the GFD by as yet unidentified serum factors. The released GFD is then available to bind and activate the PDGF receptors. This scheme provides for the accumulation of PDGF-C at localized sites without the release of the active GFD until such time as local environmental events cause the release of active protein. This model requires that full-length PDGF-C does not bind to the PDGF receptors or, if it does, is not capable of stimulating receptor activation. Results reported by Li et al. (15Li X. Ponten A. Aase K. Karlsson L. Abramsson A. Uutela M. Backstrom G. Hellstrom M. Bostrom H. Li H. Soriano P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Alitalo K. Ostman A. Eriksson U. Nat.

Clearly the analysis of historical data and activities attributed to the various members of the PDGF ligand family need to be reconsidered in a new light. The identification of a new member adds to the already complex nature of this ligand/receptor family. Further elucidation of PDGF-C activities will begin to clarify its true level of involvement in regulating the multitude of activities previously attributed to the known PDGF family members.

The causative gene is a protein kinase termed LKB1, predicted to function as a tumor suppressor. The mechanism by which LKB1 is regulated in cells is not known. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of Rat-2 or embryonic stem cells with activators of ERK1/2 or of cAMP-dependent protein kinase induced phosphorylation of endogenously expressed LKB1 at Ser431. We present pharmacological and genetic evidence that p90RSK mediated this phosphorylation in response to agonists that activate ERK1/2 and that cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediated this phosphorylation in response to agonists that activate adenylate cyclase. Ser431 of LKB1 lies adjacent to a putative prenylation motif, and we demonstrate that full-length LKB1 expressed in 293 cells was prenylated by addition of a farnesyl group to Cys433. Our data suggest that phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser431 does not affect farnesylation and that farnesylation does not affect phosphorylation at Ser431. Phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser431 did not alter the activity of LKB1 to phosphorylate itself or the tumor suppressor protein p53 or alter the amount of LKB1 associated with cell membranes. The reintroduction of wild-type LKB1 into a cancer cell line that lacks LKB1 suppressed growth, but mutants of LKB1 in which Ser431 was mutated to Ala to prevent phosphorylation of LKB1 were ineffective in inhibiting growth. In contrast, a mutant of LKB1 that cannot be prenylated was still able to suppress the growth of cells.

It is caused by mutation of a widely expressed protein kinase of unknown function termed LKB1 (also known as STK11) (3Hemminki A. Markie D. Tomlinson I. Avizienyte E. Roth S. Loukola A. Bignell G.

Genet. 1998; 18: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). To date, over 60 different mutations have been mapped to LKB1, many of which would be expected to impair LKB1 activity. These discoveries have aroused great interest because they indicate that LKB1 is likely to function in cells as a tumor suppressor, and consistent with this, overexpression of LKB1 in a number of tumor cell lines has been shown to suppress cell growth by inducing a G1 cell cycle block (5Tiainen M. Ylikorkala A. Makela T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9248-9251Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the mechanism by which LKB1 activity is regulated in cells, and no substrates for LKB1 have thus far been identified. LKB1 is a 436-amino acid protein possessing a kinase domain (residues 50–337) that is only distantly related to other mammalian kinases. The N-terminal non-catalytic domain comprises both a nuclear localization signal (6Smith D.P. Spicer J. Smith A. Swift S. Ashworth A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1479-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a putative cytoplasmic retention signal (7Nezu J. Oku A. Shimane M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 750-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). There are no yeast homologs of LKB1, but there are putative homologs inXenopus (termed XEEK1, with 84% overall identity to LKB1) (8Su J.Y. Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14430-14437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (termed PAR-4, with 26% overall identity to LKB1 and 41% identity in the kinase domain) (9Watts J.L. Morton D.G. Bestman J. Kemphues K.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar). In Drosophila, an uncharacterized protein kinase listed in the NCBI Protein Database (NCBI accession number AAF54972) possesses 44% overall identity to LKB1. Recently, a C-terminal fragment of LKB1 was shown to be phosphorylated at Ser431 by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (10Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Ser431 of LKB1 lies in the sequence Lys-Xaa-Arg-Arg-Xaa-Ser (where Xaa is any amino acid), which is conserved in all known mammalian LKB1 sequences and inXenopus XEEK1. This study did not establish whether full-length or endogenously expressed LKB1 was phosphorylated at Ser431 in response to stimuli that activated cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 or the role that this phosphorylation played in enabling LKB1 to suppress cell growth. Ser431 lies in the consensus sequence for phosphorylation by a group of kinases related to PKA, viz. p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), mitogen- and stress-stimulated protein kinase (MSK1), and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K1) (11Alessi D.R.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), that collectively belong to the AGC kinase subfamily. p90RSK is activated in cells by growth factors and phorbol esters and by ERK1/2 MAPK family members (14Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), whereas MSK1 is activated in vivo by two different types of MAPK family members, viz. ERK1/2 and the stress- and cytokine-activated p38 MAPK (13Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). S6K1 is activated in vivo by growth factors through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway and by phorbol esters and certain cellular stresses through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent pathway (15Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Ser431 is located 6 amino acids from the C terminus of LKB1, and the residues that follow Ser431 in human LKB1 are Ala-Cys-Lys-Gln-Gln. The cysteine 2 residues C-terminal from Ser431 (Cys433) thus lies 4 residues from the end of the protein in a consensus sequence known as the CAAXmotif, which mediates the prenylation of many proteins (16Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). This sequence including the Cys residue is conserved in C-terminal sequences of mammalian, Xenopus, and Drosophila LKB1. Uhler and co-workers (10Collins S.P. Reoma J.L. Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) have recently demonstrated that a C-terminal fragment of LKB1, when overexpressed in 293 cells, was prenylated at Cys433. However, these authors did not establish whether full-length LKB1 was prenylated by addition of a geranylgeranyl (C20) or a farnesyl (C15) moiety to Cys433 or if prenylation of LKB1 was required for LKB1 to suppress the growth of cells. Here, we report that p90RSK, MSK1, S6K1, and PKA phosphorylate full-length LKB1 specifically at Ser431 in vitro. We show that agonists that activate these kinases in Rat-2 cells and embryonic stem (ES) cells induce the phosphorylation of endogenous LKB1 at Ser431. We use signal transduction inhibitors and ES cells lacking p90RSK activity and ES cells deficient in MSK1 to demonstrate that phosphorylation of LKB1 induced by EGF and TPA is likely to be mediated by p90RSKrather than by MSK1 or S6K1 and that phosphorylation of LKB1 induced by forskolin is mediated by PKA. We show that full-length LKB1 expressed in 293 cells is prenylated by addition of a farnesyl moiety at Cys433, and we provide evidence that phosphorylation of LKB1 at Ser431, but not its farnesylation at Cys433, is likely to be important in mediating the ability of LKB1 to suppress cell growth.

Phosphoamino acid analysis of32P-labeled peptides, restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, site-directed mutagenesis, and other recombinant DNA procedures were performed using standard protocols. All DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. This was performed by the Sequencing Service at the School of Life Sciences of the University of Dundee using DYEnamic ET terminator chemistry (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencers. Buffer A contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.27m sucrose, and 0.1% (by volume) 2-mercaptoethanol. Buffer B contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mmEGTA.

A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to prepare an N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged cDNA construct encoding mouse LKB1 using, as a template, an expressed sequence tag encoding full-length mouse LKB1 (NCBI accession numberAA542163, IMAGE number 550355) obtained from the IMAGE consortium (20Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar).

The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into the pCR-Topo2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently subcloned as anEcoRI-EcoRI fragment into the pCMV5 vector (to encode expression of FLAG-LKB1 in mammalian cells) (21Anderson S. Davie D.N. Dahlbäck H. Jörnvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and as aSpeI-SpeI fragment into the pEBG-2T vector (to encode for expression of GST-FLAG-LKB1 in mammalian cells) (22Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) and as an EcoRI-EcoRI fragment into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (to encode for expression of GST-FLAG-LKB1 in E. coli). The indicated site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene). To prepare the catalytically inactive mutant of LKB1 termed LKB1(KD) (where KD is kinase-dead), Asp194 in subdomain VII of the kinase domain was mutated to Ala. The pGEX-4T-1 constructs encoding GST-LKB1 or the indicated mutants of LKB1 were transformed into E. coli BL21 cells, and a 0.5-liter culture was grown at 37 °C in Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the absorbance at 600 nm was 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-galactosidase (250 μm) was added, and the cells were cultured for a further 16 h at 26 °C. The cells were resuspended in 25 ml of ice-cold Buffer C and lysed by one round of freeze/thawing, and the lysates were sonicated to fragment the DNA. The lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 20,000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.44-μm filter and incubated for 60 min on a rotating platform with 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose previously equilibrated in Buffer C. The suspension was centrifuged for 1 min at 3000 × g, and the beads washed three times with 15 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl and then a further 10 times with 15 ml of Buffer A. The protein was eluted from the resin at ambient temperature by incubation with 2 ml of Buffer A containing 20 mm glutathione, and the beads were removed by filtration through a 0.44-μm filter. The eluate was divided into aliquots, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. To express GST-LKB1 or the indicated mutants of LKB1 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 20 dishes (10-cm diameter) of 293 cells were cultured, and each dish was transfected with 8 μg of the pEBG-2T construct using a modified calcium phosphate method (23Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). 36 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer C; the lysates were pooled and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g; and the GST fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and stored as described above. The rat embryonic fibroblast cell line Rat-2 and human G361 malignant melanoma cells were obtained from European Tissue Culture Collection. Rat-2 cells were cultured on 15-cm diameter dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. G361 cells were cultured on 10-cm diameter dishes in McCoy's 5a medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% (by volume) fetal calf serum. The MSK1+/+ and MSK1−/− ES cells (24Arthur J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the PDK1+/+ and PDK1−/−ES cells (25Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) were cultured on gelatinized 15-cm diameter dishes in KnockOutTM DMEM supplemented with 10% KnockOutTM serum replacement, 0.1 mmnonessential amino acids, antibiotics (100 units of penicillin G and 100 mg/ml streptomycin), 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1000 units/ml ESGROTM(murine leukemia inhibitory factor) to prevent differentiation of the cells. Prior to stimulation, Rat-2 cells were cultured in the absence of serum overnight, whereas the ES cell lines were deprived of serum for 4 h. Inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO at a 1000-fold higher concentration than they were used. These inhibitors or the equivalent volume of Me2SO as a control was added to the tissue culture medium 30 min prior to stimulation unless indicated otherwise. The cells were stimulated with the indicated agonists, lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer C, and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (58Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214321) Google Scholar), and bovine serum albumin was employed as the standard. PKA was purified from bovine heart by Dr. C. MacKintosh in the Medical Research Council Unit. MSK1 and p90RSK1 expressed as GST fusion proteins were purified from TPA-stimulated 293 cells (13Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine-tagged S6K1, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 104 residues and in which Thr412 is mutated to Glu, was expressed in insect cells and activated in vitro by phosphorylation with PDK1 (26Balendran A. Currie R.A. Armstrong C.G. Avruch J. Alessi D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37400-37406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). GST-LKB1(KD), GST-LKB1(S431A), GST-CREB, GST-BAD, or histone 2B (all at 1 μg) and the peptide Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG, 30 μm) or Kemptide (LRRASLG, 30 μm) were incubated in a total volume of 40 μl at 30 °C with 1 units/ml PKA, GST-MSK1, GST-p90RSK1, and His-S6K1 in Buffer B containing 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1000 cpm/pmol), and 1 μmmicrocystin-LR. After incubation for 15 min, incorporation of phosphate into peptides was determined using phosphocellulose P-81 paper (27Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the incorporation of phosphate into LKB1, CREB, BAD, and histone 2B was determined following the electrophoresis of samples on BisTris-4–12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and autoradiography of the gels. To map the site on LKB1 phosphorylated by PKA, p90RSK1, S6K1, and MSK1, GST-LKB1(KD) was phosphorylated by these kinases as described above, except that the reaction was performed for 60 min, and a 10-fold higher specific activity of ATP was employed. The reactions were terminated by adding 1% (by mass) SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol and heated at 100 °C for 1 min. After cooling, 4-vinylpyridine was added to a concentration of 1% (by volume), and the sample was left on a shaking platform for 30 min at room temperature to alkylate cysteine residues. The sample was subjected to electrophoresis on a BisTris-4–12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, and the 82-kDa32P-labeled band corresponding to LKB1(KD) was excised and cut into smaller pieces. These were washed sequentially for 15 min on a vibrating platform with 1 ml of the following: water, a 1:1 mixture of water and acetonitrile, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, a 1:1 mixture of 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, and finally, acetonitrile. The gel pieces were dried by rotary evaporation and incubated in 0.3 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 0.05% (by mass) zwittergent 3–16 containing 2 μg of alkylated trypsin. After 16 h, the supernatant was removed; the gel pieces were washed for 10 min in a further 0.3 ml of 50 mmammonium bicarbonate, 0.05% (by mass) zwittergent 3–16, and 0.1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid; and the combined supernatants containing >90% of the 32P radioactivity were chromatographed on a Vydac 218TP54 C18 column (Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) as described in the legend to Fig. 1. 293 cells were transfected with a pCMV5-encoded DNA construct expressing either wild-type FLAG-LKB1 or the indicated LKB1 mutants. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM, incubated for 3 h with [32P]orthophosphate (1 mCi/ml), and then left unstimulated or stimulated with forskolin (20 μm) for 10 min. FLAG-LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with anti-FLAG antibodies (5 μg of antibody conjugated to 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose). The immunoprecipitates were washed 10 times with 1 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl and once with Buffer A. The immunoprecipitated protein was alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and following autoradiography, the 32P-labeled band corresponding to FLAG-LKB1 was excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by chromatography on a C18 column as described above. Peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry on a PerSeptive Biosystems Elite-STR mass spectrometer using α-cyanocinnamic acid as the matrix. Spectra were obtained in both the linear and reflector modes. The sequence identity of each peptide was also confirmed by Edman sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 476A sequencer, and the site of phosphorylation was determined by solid-phase Edman degradation of the peptide coupled to Sequelon-AA membrane (Milligen) as described previously (28Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-LKB1 antibody raised against GST-LKB1 (1 mg) was covalently coupled to protein G-Sepharose (1 ml) using dimethyl pimelimidate (29Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Rat-2 (0.5 mg) or ES (1 mg) cell lysates were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with the LKB1-protein G-Sepharose conjugate (5 μl). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5 mNaCl and twice either with Buffer B for immunoblot analysis or with Buffer A for the p53 kinase assays. For immunoblot analysis, the beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer that did not contain 2-mercaptoethanol. For blots of total cell lysates, 20 μg of protein was used. For blots of LKB1 immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of beads that had been incubated with 0.5 mg of Rat-2 or 1 mg of ES cell lysate was used. Samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. For experiments in which LKB1 and GSK3α isoforms were being immunoblotted, the membranes were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 0.5% (by volume) Tween, and 10% (by mass) skimmed milk for 7 h at 4 °C in the presence of 1 μg/ml antibody. Immunoblotting with antibody S431-P (1 μg/ml) was carried out as described above, except that non-phosphorylated peptide (10 μg/ml) corresponding to the antigen used to raise the antibody was included. For experiments using all other commercial antibodies, we used a 1000-fold dilution of the stock antibody and 5% (by mass) bovine serum albumin in place of skimmed milk. Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The indicated amounts of Rat-2 cell lysate were used to immunoprecipitate MSK1 (500 μg of protein), p90RSK (50 μg of protein), and S6K1 (100 μg of protein). The lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a shaking platform with 5 μg of each antibody coupled to 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 1 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with 1 ml of Buffer A. The assay (50 μl) contained washed protein G-Sepharose immunoprecipitate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% (by volume) 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μm protein kinase inhibitor (TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD, peptide inhibitor of PKA), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm[γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol), and Crosstide (GRPRTSSFAEG, 30 μm) (30Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4334) Google Scholar). The assays were carried out for 15 min at 30 °C, with the assay tubes being agitated continuously to keep the immunoprecipitate in suspension, and then terminated and analyzed as described previously (27Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J.

After incubation for 60 min at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were electrophoresed on BisTris-4–12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and analyzed by autoradiography.

https://openalex.org/W2018521741,"Oral infections of mice with Trichinella spiralis induce activation of peritoneal exudate cells to transiently express and secrete a crystallizable protein Ym1. Purification of Ym1 to homogeneity was achieved. It is a single chain polypeptide (45 kDa) with a strong tendency to crystallize at its isoelectric point (pI 5.7). Co-expression of Ym1 with Mac-1 and scavenger receptor pinpoints macrophages as its main producer. Protein microsequencing data provide information required for full-length cDNA cloning from libraries constructed from activated peritoneal exudate cells. A single open reading frame of 398 amino acids with a leader peptide (21 residues) typical of secretory protein was deduced and later deposited in GenBankTM (accession number M94584) in 1992. By means of surface plasmon resonance analyses, Ym1 has been shown to exhibit binding specificity to saccharides with a free amine group, such as GlcN, GalN, or GlcN polymers, but it failed to bind to other saccharides. The interaction is pH-dependent but Ca2+ and Mg2+ion-independent. The binding avidity of Ym1 to GlcN oligosaccharides was enhanced by more than 1000-fold due to the clustering effect. Specific binding of Ym1 to heparin suggests that heparin/heparan sulfate may be its physiological ligand in vivo during inflammation and/or tissue remodeling. Although it shares ∼30% homology with microbial chitinases, no chitinase activity was found associated with Ym1. Genomic Southern blot analyses suggest that Ym1 may represent a member of a novel lectin gene family. M94584,AAB62394"
https://openalex.org/W2065383397,"Recent studies have shown that, in a wide variety of cells, mitochondria respond dynamically to physiological changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c). Mitochondrial Ca2+uptake occurs via a ruthenium red-sensitive calcium uniporter and a rapid mode of Ca2+ uptake.

Using electron microscopy and Western blotting, we identified a ryanodine receptor in the inner mitochondrial membrane with a molecular mass of approximately 600 kDa in mitochondria isolated from the rat heart. [3H]Ryanodine binds to this mitochondrial ryanodine receptor with high affinity. This binding is modulated by Ca2+ but not caffeine and is inhibited by Mg2+and ruthenium red in the assay medium. In the presence of ryanodine, Ca2+ uptake into isolated heart mitochondria is suppressed. In addition, ryanodine inhibited mitochondrial swelling induced by Ca2+ overload. This swelling effect was not observed when Ca2+ was applied to the cytosolic fraction containing sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results are the first to identify a mitochondrial Ca2+ transport protein that has characteristics similar to the ryanodine receptor.

Measuring changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]m)1in living cells with highly sensitive fluorescence dyes and targeted luminescence probes has drawn new attention on the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and its biological implications (7Babcock D.F.

Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Sheu S.-S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle cells, mitochondria also respond to physiological changes in [Ca2+]c (15Hueser J. Blatter L.A. Sheu S.-S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, controversy remains whether the mitochondrial Ca2+uptake mechanisms can sequester Ca2+ rapidly on a beat-to-beat basis (15Hueser J. Blatter L.A. Sheu S.-S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Established Ca2+ uptake mechanisms are the CaUP and rapid mode of Ca2+ uptake (1Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial CaUP is activated by Ca2+ concentrations greater than 10 μm, which are usually only achieved within cytosolic microdomains (9Rizzuto R. Brini M. Murgia M. Pozzan T. Science. 1993; 262: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). In isolated liver mitochondria, rapid mode of Ca2+ uptake responds with mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to Ca2+ pulses of less than 300 nm (16Sparagna G.C. Gunter K.K. Sheu S.-S. Gunter T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27510-27515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although these Ca2+ uptake mechanisms are kinetically and pharmacologically well characterized, their molecular identity has yet to be determined. An intriguing observation is the considerable similarity in biochemical and pharmacological properties between the mitochondrial CaUP and the SR-RyR (1Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Both, the CaUP and the SR-RyR are activated by changes in [Ca2+]c and inhibited by adenine nucleotides, Mg2+, and RR. The strikingly similar properties of these proteins led to our hypothesis that mitochondria contain a RyR. Here we show with immunological, biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological techniques that heart mitochondria contain a functional RyR within the IMM. This mRyR underlies fast mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and, therefore, is uniquely positioned to regulate dynamically Ca2+-mediated cellular processes such as ATP production during heartbeat (18McCormack J.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Ryanodine was purchased from Calbiochem and [3H]ryanodine from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies against RyR (clone 34C), developed by J. Airey and J. Sutko, were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA) and from RBI/Sigma. The antibodies against the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the sarco- and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) were obtained from Calbiochem and Santa Cruz, respectively. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless noted. Heart mitochondria were isolated in isotonic ice-cold mannitol/sucrose buffer (M/S buffer; in mm: 225 mannitol, 10 sucrose, 0.5 EGTA, 1 glutathione; 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) by differential centrifugation and subsequent purification on a Percoll gradient (19Rehncrona S. Mela L. Siesjo B.K. Stroke. 1979; 10: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The final two washes were done in EGTA-free buffer. The isolated mitochondria were stored on ice and used for experiments for up to 4 h after finishing the isolation procedure. Experiments were done with mitochondria having intact RR- and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone-sensitive Ca2+uptake mechanisms, as measured with a Ca2+-sensitive microelectrode. Mitochondrial subfractions were prepared as described previously (20Ohlendieck K. Riesinger I. Adams V. Krause J. Brdiczka D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 672-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated mitochondria from 2 rat hearts were osmotically shocked first in 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 for 20 min on ice followed by the addition of sucrose (20% final concentration). Mitochondrial membranes were disrupted by sonication (two times for 30 s), and eventually intact mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 7,000 × g. The supernatant was transferred as a final layer onto a continuous sucrose gradient (from 60% to 30% in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged for at least 8 h at 70,000 × g to separate mitochondrial membrane vesicles. The mitochondrial subfractions were tested for specific marker proteins (succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) for IMM, creatine kinase for contact sites between IMM and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and the VDAC for OMM). The characterized fractions were diluted 2-fold with M/S buffer, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and centrifuged for 90 min at 300,000 × g to sediment the mRyR. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of M/S buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen until needed. For immunogold labeling of RyR, isolated heart mitochondria were embedded in Lowicryl mixture at −20 °C. Gold labeling of ultrathin sections of embedded mitochondria against RyR was performed as described previously (21Herrera G.A. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1989; 13: 485-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,22de Mesy Jensen K.L. di Sant'Agnese P.A. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 1992; 16: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For the immunological detection of the RyR and SERCA, 100 μg of protein was loaded on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min at 100 V. For VDAC, 50 μg of protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred for 45 min at 100 V onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were performed using the Aurora chemiluminescence assay (ICN) with an alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody. For binding assays, 100 μg of mitochondrial protein were incubated with different concentrations of [3H]ryanodine in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (in mm: 170 KCl, 0.02 CaCl2, 10 MOPS, pH 7.0) for 16 h at 25 °C. For nonspecific binding, Ca2+ was replaced by 6 mm EGTA. At the end of the incubation time, the reaction mixture was filtered under reduced pressure through glass fiber filters (Whatman) and washed with ice-cold buffer (170 mm KCl, 10 mm MOPS). Mitochondria (1 mg) were diluted in 1 ml of M/S buffer containing 10 μm EGTA, and the free Ca2+concentration was calculated to be 60 μm. Net Ca2+ uptake was measured by monitoring changes in external Ca2+ concentration in the reaction medium using a Ca2+-selective electrode (Microelectrode Inc., Bedford, NH). Mitochondria were suspended in M/S buffer containing 10 μm EGTA (to chelate Ca2+ impurities in distilled water) to a final concentration of ∼10 mg of protein/ml. After incubation in 5 μm rhod-2 AM (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at room temperature, mitochondria were washed three times to remove external rhod-2. Mitochondria were used for experiments 30 min after finishing the loading protocol to ensure cleavage of the rhod-2 AM into the membrane-impermeable rhod-2 free acid. For [Ca2+]m measurement, isolated, rhod-2-loaded mitochondria in a 0.5-μl droplet were adhered to a glass coverslip and mounted on the stage of an Eclipse TE200 microscope equipped with a SuperFluor 40X (1.3 numeric aperture oil immersion objective, Nikon). This solution was mixed with 5 μl of “caged-Ca2+” solution containing (in mm: 130 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 succinate, 10 o-nitrophenyl EGTA, 5 CaCl2, 2 Mg-ATP, 1.2 MgCl2, pH 7.2). For the pulsatile photolytic release of Ca2+ in the external media, a 1-ms flash of ∼250 J of UV light (340–360 nm) was produced at 0.2 Hz. Determination of relative changes in [Ca2+]mwas performed using digital imaging microscopy with a monochrometer-based system and high speed CCD camera (T.I.L.L.-Photonics). Rhod-2 labeled mitochondria were excited at 530 ± 15 nm and fluorescence emission collected using a 565 nm long pass filter (Chroma). Images were acquired at a rate of 2–4 Hz without binning and displayed as ΔF/F 0, where ΔF/F 0 = 100[(F −F 0)/F 0], andF is the recorded fluorescence and F 0was obtained from the average of 15 sequential frames prior to uncaging. Estimation of the evoked changes in external Ca2+([Ca2+]ext) was performed using the low affinity Ca2+ indicator, Oregon Green Bapta 5N (OGB-5N; Molecular Probes). Using a range of standard solutions buffered at set Ca2+ concentrations (Molecular Probes) and the equation [Ca2+]ext = K d [(F −F min)/(F max −F)], the dissociation constant (K d ),F min, and F max were determined to be 21 μm, 57, and 1050, respectively. For measurement of [Ca2+]ext, a 5-μl droplet containing 50 μm OGB-5N was excited at 488 ± 15 nm and fluorescence emission collected through a 525 ± 25 nm band pass filter (Chroma). Mitochondrial swelling was induced as described previously (23Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated heart mitochondria (1 mg of protein) were diluted in 1 ml of modified M/S buffer (in mm: 120 KCl, 65 mannitol, 30 sucrose, 10 succinate, 5 Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2). The absorbance was recorded with a spectrophotometer (Spectronic) at 540 nm for 2–3 min to obtain a stable base line, followed by the addition of Ca2+ to induce mitochondrial swelling. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that ∼70% of isolated adult rat heart mitochondria, treated with gold-labeled antibodies against SR-RyR, were labeled with 1–4 gold particles (Fig.1 A). The majority of the gold particles were found in the cristae membrane of IMM (73.3% of total), although some labeling was detected in the peripheral IMM. In contrast, no significant labeling was found in the OMM and extramitochondrial membranes (3.5% of total counted gold particles). In absence of the RyR antibody, only 5% of the mitochondria showed labeling with a maximum of 1 gold particle (Fig. 1 B). Using Western blot analysis, we confirmed the specific detection of RyR-like protein in the IMM from osmotically shocked rat heart mitochondria (Fig. 1 C). Western blots performed on the cytosolic and mitochondrial subfractions demonstrated immunoreactivity against RyR in all fractions except the OMM (Fig. 1 C,anti-RyR). A positive signal against RyR protein in the IMM was obtained in all preparations (n = 6). In all tested fractions, the RyR antibody labeled a protein of ∼600 kDa. The purity of the IMM fraction was verified by the presence of SDH activity, an enzyme localized exclusively in the IMM. Furthermore, this fraction was free of SERCA and VDAC (Fig. 1 C, anti-SERCA,anti-VDAC) in all preparations, indicating that the IMM fraction is devoid of any significant contamination from SR and OMM fragments. In addition, SERCA pump proteins were not detected in four independently isolated mitochondrial preparations (Fig. 1 D), indicating that even the intact mitochondria had minimal SR contamination. An extensive effort to exclude the possibility that the mRyR was not caused by contamination with SR-RyR was deemed essential, because mitochondria are located in close proximity to the SR in cardiac muscle cells (14Sharma V. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Sheu S.-S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 24Ogata T. Yamasaki Y. Anat. Rec. 1997; 248: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The chosen marker proteins, such as SERCA, VDAC, and SDH, are specific for their intracellular location. Labeling of the RyR in the purified IMM with a specific antibody is consistent with the result obtained by electron microscopy, showing that the mRyR is localized within the IMM (Fig. 1 A). The molecular weight of the detected RyR proteins in the IMM and the cross-reactivity with the used SR-RyR specific antibody suggests that the mRyR is structurally homologous to the SR-RyR. Various physiological and pharmacological effectors including Ca2+, caffeine, Mg2+, and RR modulate ryanodine binding to the SR-RyR (25Pessah I.N. Stambuk R.A. Casida J.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 232-238PubMed Google Scholar, 26Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To characterize the pharmacological properties of mRyR, we studied [3H]ryanodine binding to heart mitochondria in presence of these modulators. [3H]Ryanodine bound to isolated heart mitochondria in presence of 20 μm Ca2+with an apparent affinity (K d ) of 9.8 ± 2.1 nm (n = 3, in triplicate for all binding experiments; Fig. 2 A). Depending on the experimental conditions employed, it has been reported that SR-RyR exhibited an apparent K d between 2 and 200 nm for ryanodine (27Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15637-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lindsay A.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The maximal density of mRyR binding sites (B max) was 398.4 ± 12 fmol/mg of protein (n = 3; Scatchard plot in Fig.2 A), which is ∼10 times less than that described for [3H]ryanodine binding to purified SR membranes under similar experimental conditions (28Lindsay A.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1064: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Kijima Y. Saito A. Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3499-3506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that [3H]ryanodine binding was not due to contamination by SR, binding was performed with equal amounts of proteins from intact isolated mitochondria and mitochondrial subfractions. The results showed that ∼90 ± 5% (n = 3) of the total [3H]ryanodine bound to mitochondria was due to binding to the IMM and not to other fractions. The amount of [3H]ryanodine binding to mitochondria as a function of free Ca2+ concentration in the assay media was biphasic. Binding increased at pCa between 5 and 7 and decreased at pCa between 3 and 4 with maximal binding atpCa 5.3 (Fig. 2 B). Surprisingly, unlike the cardiac SR-RyR, caffeine did not enhance mitochondrial ryanodine binding (n = 3). Caffeine-insensitive RyR, however, have been described in canine salivary glands (30Yamaki H. Morita K. Kitayama S. Imai Y. Itadani K. Akagawa Y. Dohi T. J. Dent. Res. 1998; 77: 1807-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and in Jurkat cells (31Hakamata Y. Nishimura S. Nakai J. Nakashima Y. Kita T. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mg2+ is known to decrease the B maxfor [3H]ryanodine binding and to inhibit SR Ca2+ efflux in skeletal and cardiac muscle (26Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 32Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Liu W. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C120-V128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with single-channel studies, where millimolar concentrations of Mg2+ reduced the open probability of the RyR and maintained the channel in a closed state (25Pessah I.N.

Accordingly, we studied the effects of Mg2+ on [3H]ryanodine binding in isolated heart mitochondria and observed a 50% inhibition in presence of 0.33 mmMg2+ (n = 3, Fig. 2 C). Under comparable experimental conditions, it has been shown that up to 1 mm Mg2+ did not have any inhibitory effects on ryanodine binding in cardiac SR-RyR (34Pessah I.N. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35Holmberg S.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

This suggests that, in cardiac muscle cells, the mRyR is more sensitive to Mg2+inhibition of [3H]ryanodine binding than the SR-RyR. RR inhibits the release of Ca2+ from the SR in skeletal and cardiac muscles by decreasing the open probability of the RyR (26Meissner G. Darling E. Eveleth J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 37Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After RR treatment, [3H]ryanodine binding to isolated rat heart mitochondria was strongly inhibited with IC50 = 105 nm (n = 3, Fig. 2 D). This suppression of mitochondrial [3H]ryanodine binding by RR is much more potent than that observed in cardiac SR-RyR, which had IC50 values between 290 and 1,000 nm (34Pessah I.N. Waterhouse A.L. Casida J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 35Holmberg S.R. Williams A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1022: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Consistent with the binding data, we have shown that RR (1–5 μm) blocks mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake without much effect on SR Ca2+ release in chemically skinned cardiac myocytes (14Sharma V. Ramesh V. Franzini-Armstrong C. Sheu S.-S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results indicate that significant differences exist in the potency of RR in inhibiting mRyR and SR-RyR. The binding data provide pharmacological evidence of the existence of mRyR in the IMM. They also show that there are distinct differences between mRyR and SR-RyR with respect to their abundance and their sensitivities to caffeine, Mg2+, and RR. Therefore, the mRyR and SR-RyR would operate at different capacities under similar conditions and could be regulated and modulated differentially. We next investigated functional aspects of mRyR in the sequestration of Ca2+ using two different methods. Adding mitochondria to a buffer containing 60 μm free Ca2+ caused a significant mitochondrial Ca2+uptake, as measured by a decrease in the extramitochondrial Ca2+ concentration with a Ca2+-selective microelectrode (Fig. 3 A,control). In the presence of 100 or 10 μmryanodine, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was suppressed by 60 ± 2.7% or 41.2 ± 1.9%, respectively (Fig.3 A, n = 15). Removal of the OMM with digitonin (25 μg/mg of mitochondrial protein for 30 s) to minimize possible SR-contamination had no significant effect on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in the presence or absence of ryanodine (Fig. 3 D). The same inhibitory effect in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was observed with dantrolene, a compound that has been shown to inhibit the skeletal muscle SR-RyR and therefore Ca2+ release (17Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The effect of dantrolene on the cardiac SR-RyR is still controversial (38Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26965-26971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 39Meissner A. Min J.Y. Haake N. Hirt S. Simon R. Eur. J. Heart Fail. 1999; 1: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 40Fratea S. Langeron O. Lecarpentier Y. Coriat P. Riou B. Anesthesiology. 1997; 86: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, incubation of isolated mitochondria with 10 μm dantrolene decreased mitochondrial Ca2+uptake by 55.9 ± 7.8% (Fig. 3, B and D;n = 5). Finally, the presence of 30 μmcyclopiazonic acid (CPA), an inhibitor of SERCA, did not alter mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake compared with untreated mitochondria (96 ± 2.4%, n = 3), indicating little contamination of the SR-RyR (Fig. 3, C andD). The relatively slow response time of Ca2+ microelectrodes made them unable to follow the rapid mitochondrial Ca2+uptake during Ca2+ pulses. To investigate whether the mRyR contributes to rapid Ca2+ uptake, we measured the Ca2+ responses of single or small clusters of isolated, rhod-2-loaded mitochondria using high speed digital imaging in combination with pulsatile flash photolysis of caged Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 4 (A andC), Ca2+ uptake was stimulated in rhod-2-loaded isolated heart mitochondria after flash photolysis of caged Ca2+ in the external solution. The slow decay in the fluorescence may result from absence of Na+ in the solution that inhibited Na+-dependent Ca2+efflux. In Fig. 4 B, a low affinity Ca2+indicator Oregon Green Bapta-5N was used in separate experiments to confirm that pulsatile flash photolysis resulted in elevations in extramitochondrial Ca2+ that reached to their peak value within sampling time of one frame (250–500 ms). After pre-incubating mitochondria with 100 μm ryanodine, a significant component of the evoked change in mitochondrial fluorescence was suppressed (Fig. 4 C). The cumulative change in fluorescence (ΔF) evoked by each flash was 0.14 ± 0.02, 0.34 ± 0.05, 0.58 ± 0.08, 0.85 ± 0.04, and 1 for control; and 0.05 ± 0.02, 0.12 ± 0.04, 0.25 ± 0.07, 0.40 ± 0.09, and 0.60 ± 0.13 for ryanodine-treated mitochondria (n = 6, Fig. 4 D). The magnitude of [Ca2+]m at higher number of flashes in the control solution could be an underestimation, due to the saturation of rhod-2 (K d = 0.6–0.8 μm). This could account for the decrease in the slope of control curve between flash number 4 and 5 in Fig. 4 D. Finally, this mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was not due to release of Ca2+ from SR contamination, because repetitive UV flashes applied to rhod-2-loaded mitochondria in a droplet containing 100 μmd-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, P4(5)-1-(2-nitrophenyl)ethyl ester, a concentration of caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate shown to evoke robust Ca2+ release from reticular stores (41Giovannucci D.R. Groblewski G.E. Sneyd J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33704-33711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), induced no measurable ΔF. The ability of mitochondria to sequester significant amount of Ca2+ through a ryanodine inhibitory pathway suggests that the mRyR could play an important role in buffering high concentrations of [Ca2+]c. Consistent with our experiments, a decrease in [Ca2+]m in the presence of ryanodine has been observed in A10 cells when perfused with more then 1 μm Ca2+ (42Nassar A. Simpson A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23661-23665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ability of mitochondria to respond instantaneously to fast Ca2+ pulses through a ryanodine inhibitable pathway suggests that the mRyR may be responsible for Ca2+ sequestration during heartbeats. Excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix depolarizes the mitochondrial membrane potential and disrupts fundamental mitochondrial functions like oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production, which results in opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in isolated heart and liver mitochondria (23Petronilli V. Cola C. Massari S. Colonna R. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21939-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Halestrap A.P. Davidson A.M. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This is accompanied by mitochondrial swelling and can be measured by the decrease of absorbance at 540 nm. Inducing mitochondrial swelling in isolated intact heart mitochondria with 100 μm Ca2+ led to a decrease in absorbance of 19.5 ± 3.4% (n = 8). Upon preincubation with 2–20 μm ryanodine, we observed a concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca2+-induced mitochondrial swelling (Fig.5 A). Interestingly, less then 2 μm ryanodine significantly enhanced mitochondrial swelling in all experiments (Fig. 5, A and B;n = 6). CPA had no effect on the inhibition of mitochondrial swelling after treatment with 20 μmryanodine (Fig. 6). In addition, the concentration dependence in ryanodine-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial swelling by ryanodine was also not altered by CPA treatment (data not shown). An accelerated mitochondrial swelling in the presence of less than 2 μm ryanodine or the inhibition of swelling by higher ryanodine concentrations is in agreement with the literature, where low ryanodine concentrations switch the SR-RyR into an open state and higher concentrations keep the Ca2+ channel in the RyR closed (17Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 44McGrew S.G. Wolleben C. Siegl P. Inui M. Fleischer S.

Data are expressed as mean values ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dantrolene (10 μm) was as effective as 20 μm ryanodine in blocking mitochondrial swelling (Fig. 6). Finally, the SR-containing cytosolic fraction itself revealed no significant changes in absorbance after the addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 6). In these experiments the same amount of cytosolic protein and experimental protocol was used as that described for mitochondrial swelling. Therefore, the possibility that the effect of mitochondrial swelling could be mimicked by cytosolic components like the SR was excluded. Mitochondrial swelling due to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore has been implicated in triggering apoptosis and necrosis of several cell types (45Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Colonna R. Petronilli V. Di Lisa F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 687-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The ability of ryanodine to prevent such mitochondrial swelling by blocking influx of Ca2+ may provide some insights into the development of novel therapeutic agents for mitochondria-mediated cell injury and death. The present study demonstrates that mitochondria contain a RyR within the IMM, which shares several, similar biochemical, pharmacological, and physiological properties with both the SR-RyR and the CaUP. Based on the results presented here, a contamination of the purified mitochondria by SR-RyR can be excluded for several reasons. 1) Preparations of isolated mitochondria were free of detectable amounts of SERCA protein. 2) The separated OMM fraction tested positive for VDAC but negative for SDH activity. 3) The separated IMM tested positive for SDH but negative for the OMM protein VDAC and the SR protein SERCA. 4) CPA had no effect on mitochondrial Ca2+uptake and mitochondrial swelling. 5) [3H]Ryanodine binding was more sensitive to Mg2+ and RR inhibition. 6) Caffeine had no effect on ryanodine binding. The localization of mRyR in the IMM may raise the question of whether the RyR, like other intracellular membrane proteins, could have multiple intracellular locations. It has been shown that the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor is localized in the nucleus (46Mak D.O. Foskett J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29375-29378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the plasma membrane (48Munger S.D. Gleeson R.A. Aldrich H.C. Rust N.C. Ache B.W. Greenberg R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20450-20457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in addition to the ER and SR. Likewise, proteins of the cell death-regulating Bcl-2 family have been shown to be localized in the OMM, the nucleus membrane, and the ER membranes (49Kroemer G. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). A Na+/Ca2+ exchanger is localized in the IMM but also in the plasma membrane (1Gunter T.E. Gunter K.K. Sheu S-S. Gavin C.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C313-C339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in [Ca2+]c activates the RyR in the SR or ER to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores due to an outwardly directed Ca2+ electrochemical gradient. Conversely, the inwardly directed Ca2+ electrochemical gradient in mitochondria could result in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ uptake following the activation of mRyR. Finally, because of the pharmacological similarities to the CaUP, it is tempting to speculate that the mRyR is the CaUP. The proximity between the mitochondria and other Ca2+transport proteins, such as SR- or ER-RyR and L-type Ca2+channels, would allow mitochondria to sense microdomains with Ca2+ concentrations sufficient to open the mRyR (Fig.7). Ca2+ released by SR-RyR has been shown to activate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and subsequently causes an increase in electron transport chain activity and NAD(P)H fluorescence (50Szalai G. Csordas G. Hantash B.M. Thomas A.P. Hajnoczky G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15305-15313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The rapid influx of Ca2+into the mitochondria would also contribute to local cytosolic Ca2+ buffering, thus regulating biological processes such as ATP production and intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Conversely, dysregulation in a mRyR may play an important role in the development of disease states such as heart failure and neurodegeneration. The antibody against RyR developed by J. Airey and J. Sutko was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences of the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA).

All of these are denitrifying bacteria that belong to the genus Azoarcus of the β-proteobacteria. For one of these strains, Azoarcussp. EB-1, ethylbenzene is the only known hydrocarbon utilized as growth substrate (1Ball H.A. Johnson H.A. Reinhard M. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other two strains utilize either ethylbenzene or an alternative hydrocarbon compound, namely toluene (strain EbN1) orn-propylbenzene (strain PbN1) (2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The proposed pathway of anaerobic degradation of ethylbenzene by these bacteria is shown in Fig. 1. It is initiated by a novel biochemical reaction, namely an oxygen-independent oxidation of ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol. This intermediate is then oxidized further to acetophenone by an alcohol dehydrogenase (1Ball H.A. Johnson H.A. Reinhard M. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Rabus R. Heider J. Arch.

Activities of an ethylbenzene-oxidizing enzyme and an enantio-specific (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase have been reported in cell extracts of strain EB-1 (4Johnson H.A. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a substrate-specific (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase has been purified and characterized from strain EbN1. 1O. Kniemeyer and J. Heider, submitted for publication. The intermediate acetophenone is apparently degraded further by carboxylation to benzoylacetate to yield benzoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA eventually (Fig. 1; for review, see Ref. 5Heider J. Spormann A.M. Beller H.R. Widdel F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 459-473Crossref Google Scholar). The catabolic pathway ofn-propylbenzene in strain PbN1 is supposed to be analogous to that of ethylbenzene, yielding benzoyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA as intermediates (2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Toluene degradation in strain EbN1 proceeds via a completely different pathway and involves the formation of benzylsuccinate from toluene and fumarate as initial reaction (3Rabus R. Heider J. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 377-384Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Biegert T. Fuchs G. Heider J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,7Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we analyze the biochemical properties of the first enzyme of anaerobic ethylbenzene metabolism, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. The enzyme was purified and shown to be a new periplasmic molybdenum/iron-sulfur/heme protein that oxidizes ethylbenzene stereospecifically to (S)-1-phenylethanol. We also provide evidence that the same enzyme catalyzes anaerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene. Strain EbN1 was isolated previously from an enrichment culture on ethylbenzene by Rabus and Widdel (2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Growth of the bacteria in 1–2-liter scale cultures was performed as described previously (2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 3Rabus R. Heider J. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 377-384Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Cells were grown by subsequent transfer for at least 30 generations on the same substrate prior to harvesting for the described experiments. Harvesting was performed anoxically while the cultures were in the exponential growth phase. Fermenter cultures (200 liters) were set up as described previously (3Rabus R. Heider J. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 377-384Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and run in fed-batch mode with a growth-limiting and exponentially increasing feeding rate of nitrate and discontinuous supply of ethylbenzene. Growth rates of 0.015–0.025 h−1 and cell yields of 200–300 g (wet mass)/fermenter were usually obtained. Extract preparation was usually performed aerobically. Cells (10 g, wet mass) were suspended in 10 ml of water and passed through a French pressure cell at 137 megapascals. Cell debris and membranes were removed by ultracentrifugation (1 h at 100,000 × g). Washed membrane fractions were prepared from the supernatant of a 20,000 × g centrifugation step, which was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was washed and resuspended in the same volume of basal buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5). For anaerobic extract preparation, all solutions were degassed and stored under nitrogen, and all handling steps were performed in an anaerobic glove box as described earlier (3Rabus R. Heider J. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 377-384Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Strain PbN1 (2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 163: 96-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) was grown in 2-liter bottles under the same conditions as described for strain EbN1. The hydrocarbon substrates were added to the cultures in an inert carrier phase (2,2,4,4,6,8,8-heptamethylnonane) containing 2% (v/v) ethylbenzene or 4% (v/v) n-propylbenzene. Shortest doubling times of 10.5 h on ethylbenzene and 12 h on n-propylbenzene were recorded. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was routinely assayed in 100 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 mm ferricenium hexafluorophosphate as electron acceptor. Enzyme solution was added, and the reactions were started by adding ethylbenzene or n-propylbenzene (final concentration, 100 μm) from saturated aqueous solutions, which contained 2 mm ethylbenzene (8Dean J.A. Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. 14th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1992: 1.202Google Scholar) or 1 mm n-propylbenzene (9Mackay D. Shiu W.Y. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1981; 10: 1175-1199Crossref Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Decrease of absorption of the ferricenium ion was followed at 290 nm (Δε = 9,000m−1cm−1). The tests were routinely performed under aerobic conditions because identical activities were observed in control tests under anaerobic conditions. To assess the pH optimum of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, the enzyme assay was also performed in sodium phosphate buffers within a pH range of 6.0–8.0. Alternative assays for ethylbenzene oxidation were set up with 0.1 mmdichlorophenol indophenol as electron acceptor in the presence and absence of the redox mediator phenazine methosulfate (0.05 mm). These tests were performed under anaerobic conditions as described above and were monitored for dichlorophenol indophenol reduction at 546 nm. Reversibility of the ethylbenzene dehydrogenase reaction was tested under strictly anaerobic conditions in 100 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5), containing 1 mmmethyl viologen and 0.5 mm dithionite. Oxidation of reduced methyl viologen was followed at 710 nm (ε = 2,400m−1cm−1). After adding the enzyme, the reaction was started by adding 1 mm (S)-1-phenylethanol. The same buffer was also used to assess the purified enzyme for possible selenate reductase or nitrate reductase activities. In these cases, the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mmrespective electron acceptor. (S)-1-Phenylethanol dehydrogenase activity was assayed in 100 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm NAD, and 1 mm (S)-1-phenylethanol and enzyme. Malate dehydrogenase activity was measured in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7) containing 0.25 mm NADH, 0.2 mm oxaloacetate, and cell extract. Reduction of NAD+ or oxidation of NADH was followed photometrically at 365 nm (ε = 3.4 mm−1cm−1). All column chromatography steps were performed in an anaerobic glove box with an FPLC System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Extract of ethylbenzene-grown cells of strain EbN1 (20 ml of a 100,000 × g supernatant) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 2.2-cm diameter, 50-ml volume), which had been equilibrated with basal buffer (2 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 8.0, and 10% w/v glycerol). The column was washed at a flow rate of 5 ml min−1for 2 column volumes and eluted with a gradient from 0 to 50 mm KCl in basal buffer over 500 ml. Fractions of 7 ml were collected. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity eluted in a volume of 80 ml between 40 and 50 mm KCl. A yield of 77% and an enrichment factor of 20 were obtained after this step (see Table III). The active fractions were applied on a ceramic hydroxyapatite column (10 ml; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), which had been equilibrated with basal buffer. The column was washed with 2 volumes of basal buffer. A gradient over 100 ml was then applied from 0 to 300 mmpotassium phosphate, and fractions of 5 ml were collected. Enzyme activity eluted in a volume of 40 ml when 160–250 mmpotassium phosphate was applied. Active fractions were pooled, and ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation under anaerobic conditions (60% saturation of ammonium sulfate).Table IIIPurification of ethylbenzene dehydrogenaseVolumeTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldEnrichmentmlμmol/minmgnmol/min/mg%foldExtract127,700480161001DEAE-Sepharose805,920193127720Hydroxyapatite401,56043902024A typical purification scheme is shown.

EDTA (9 mm final concentration) and lysozyme (2.6 × 106 units) were added, and the suspension was incubated on ice for 120 min to produce spheroplasts. Periplasmic proteins were prepared by centrifugation of the spheroplast suspension for 30 min at 16,000 × g. Most of the periplasmic proteins were recovered in the supernatant, whereas the pellet contained the intact spheroplasts. These were washed in TS buffer, suspended in 25 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, pH 8) containing 10 mg DNase I and lysed by one passage through a French pressure cell. The membrane and soluble cytoplasmic fractions of the cell lysate were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined according to Lowry (12Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) or by the Coomassie dye binding test (12Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M.

Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Molecular mass standards were phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, lactate dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, trypsin inhibitor, and lysozyme. Gels were analyzed by the ImageMaster® one-dimensional software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UV-visible spectra were recorded with a λ2 photometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cytochrome c content in subcellular fractions was analyzed and calculated as described (13Smith L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 23: 202-212Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The native molecular mass of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was determined by gel filtration on a calibrated Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and by analysis of purified enzyme on native polyacrylamide gels. Gels containing five different polyacrylamide concentrations between 6 and 8% (w/v) were used, and ovalbumin and the monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer bands of bovine serum albumin were used as standards for a Ferguson plot (12Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar).

Biol. Chem. 1963; 193: 265-275Google Scholar), and inorganic sulfide (16Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) was performed by standard chemical techniques. Additionally, a simultaneous determination of 32 elements in purified enzyme was performed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) using a Jarrel Ash Plasma Comp 750 instrument at the center of Complex Carbohydrate Research, University of Georgia. For protein microsequencing, cell extract or purified enzyme was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pro Blott, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) using a Semi-Phor (model TE77) semidry blotting device as described in (17Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were stained by Coomassie Blue R-250. The proteins were subjected to Edman degradation microsequencing (Procise 492 Sequencer, Applied Biosystems) with repetitive yields of >96%. Ferricenium hexafluorophosphate was synthesized following a published procedure (18Lehman T.C. Hale D.E. Bhala A. Thorpe C. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 186: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar); all other chemicals were from Fluka, Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and were of the highest available purity. A photometric enzyme assay was developed for the first enzyme of anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation of strain EbN1, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. The artificial electron acceptors dichlorophenol indophenol or phenazine methosulfate were tested without success for coupling to ethylbenzene oxidation. However, significant activity of an ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was detected in extracts of ethylbenzene-grown cells with the ferricenium cation as electron acceptor. The assay was dependent on the amount of protein, and a pH optimum of 7.0 was determined. Identical activities were obtained under oxic and strictly anoxic conditions, indicating that molecular oxygen is not required for ethylbenzene oxidation. No decrease in activity was recorded when extracts were adjusted to pH 5.5 or to pH 9.0 prior to starting the enzyme assay. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity was detected exclusively in the soluble fraction after 100,000 ×g centrifugation; no activity was found in washed membrane fractions. With untreated cell extracts, an ethylbenzene:ferricenium stoichiometry (ethylbenzene:electron ratio) of 1:3.9 was determined, indicating that ethylbenzene is oxidized to acetophenone in these assays. Assuming a stoichiometry of 1:4, the specific ethylbenzene oxidation rate in 100,000 × g supernatants was 22 ± 4 nmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1. This value is close to a calculated minimum substrate degradation rate of 28 nmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1 required in growing cells at the time of harvesting (doubling time 11 h). Very low ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity was recorded in extracts of cells grown on (S)-, (R)-, or racemic 1-phenylethanol, or on acetophenone, and none in benzoate-grown cells (TableI). Clear activity was also observed when ethylbenzene was replaced by n-propylbenzene in the assays with ethylbenzene-grown cells, albeit only at about 15% of the activity measured with ethylbenzene (Table I).Table IEthylbenzene dehydrogenase and n-propylbenzene dehydrogenase activities in 100,000 × g extracts of differently grown cells of Azoarcus sp. strains EbN1 and PbN1StrainGrowth substrateSpecific activity withEthylbenzenen-Propylbenzenenmol/min/mg proteinEbN1Ethylbenzene22.13.5EbN1(S)-1-Phenylethanol1.5NDEbN1(R)-1-Phenylethanol1.1NDEbN1(R/S)-1-Phenylethanol3.0NDEbN1Acetophenone1.4NDEbN1Benzoate<0.1NDPbN1n-Propylbenzene45.530.0PbN1Ethylbenzene52.532.5PbN1Benzoate<0.1<0.1No activity was measured in washed membrane fractions.

The values are means of at least two measurements. Standard deviations were <11%. ND, not determined. Cells of strain PbN1, which were grown in 2-liter cultures on ethylbenzene or n-propylbenzene, were also tested for dehydrogenase activities for ethylbenzene andn-propylbenzene. Ethylbenzene-grown cells of strain PbN1 contained two times higher specific activities of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase than observed in strain EbN1 (Table I). In extracts of strain PbN1, n-propylbenzene was oxidized at a rate of 62–66% of that measured with ethylbenzene. If strain PbN1 was grown on n-propylbenzene, the specific activity of the enzyme was slightly lower, but the ratio of the rates withn-propylbenzene or ethylbenzene as substrates was nearly the same as with ethylbenzene-grown cells (Table I). These findings suggest that ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene are oxidized by a common enzyme. Specific activities for both substrates were sufficient to explain the observed growth rates of strain PbN1 on either hydrocarbon. Ethylbenzene-grown cells of strain EbN1 contained large amounts of several substrate-induced polypeptides, which were lacking in cells grown on 1-phenylethanol, the next intermediate of the metabolic pathway. The most prominent ethylbenzene-induced polypeptides visible in cell extracts separated by SDS-PAGE are shown in Fig. 2. Several other substrate-induced polypeptides were also observed in cells grown on 1-phenylethanol or acetophenone compared with benzoate-grown cells (Fig. 2), indicating sequential induction of the catabolic enzymes of anaerobic ethylbenzene metabolism. Extracts of ethylbenzene- orn-propylbenzene-grown cells of strain PbN1 showed no obvious difference in polypeptide patterns. Several prominent substrate-induced polypeptides of identical sizes were observed in cells grown on either hydrocarbon substrate compared with benzoate-grown cells (Fig. 2). Proteins in extracts of ethylbenzene-grown cells ofAzoarcus sp. strain EbN1 were separated initially by chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose in 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5). Under these conditions, 100% of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity was found in the flow-through fractions. (R)- and (S)-1-Phenylethanol dehydrogenases from the cell extract were retained on the column,1 thus allowing complete separation of the first two enzymes of ethylbenzene degradation. Using the separated enzymes, we determined whether the four-electron oxidation of ethylbenzene to acetophenone, as detected in cell extracts, is catalyzed by ethylbenzene dehydrogenase alone, or whether it depends on the subsequent (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase reaction. Enzyme assays with ethylbenzene dehydrogenase containing flow-through fractions, which are devoid of (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase, showed an ethylbenzene:ferricenium stoichiometry of 1:2.3. The stoichiometry changed to 1:4.1 when the tests were supplied with NAD+ and purified (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase1 and remained at 1:2.3 when the same experiment was performed in the absence of NAD+. Therefore, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase catalyzes a two-electron oxidation of ethylbenzene, and stereospecifically produces (S)-1-phenylethanol, which is subsequently oxidized to acetophenone by (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase in cell extract. The NADH generated by the alcohol dehydrogenase is apparently reoxidized by an NADH:acceptor oxidoreductase with ferricenium as electron acceptor. After generating spheroplasts from freshly harvested cells of ethylbenzene-grown strain EbN1 by lysozyme/EDTA treatment in isotonic Tris-Cl/sucrose buffer, 94% of the ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was released into the medium (Table II). The periplasmic marker protein cytochrome c was also largely released in these experiments, as determined from difference spectra (dithionite-reduced minus oxidized), whereas 93% of the cytoplasmic marker enzyme malate dehydrogenase was retained in the spheroplasts (Table II). Determination of (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase activities in the subcellular fractions showed that 20% of this enzyme was released, and about 80% was retained in the spheroplasts (Table II). This indicated that ethylbenzene oxidation to (S)-1-phenylethanol occurs in the periplasm, whereas further oxidation of (S)-1-phenylethanol to acetophenone occurs in the cytoplasm. This is corroborated by the stoichiometries of ethylbenzene oxidation versus ferricenium reduction in the different subcellular fractions. In cytoplasmic fractions, an ethylbenzene:ferricenium stoichiometry of 1:3.2 was determined, indicating coupling of the residual ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity with (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase, whereas the periplasmic fractions showed an ethylbenzene:ferricenium stoichiometry of 1:1.9.Table IISubcellular distribution of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase in Azoarcus strain EbN1FractionEthylbenzene dehydrogenaseMalate dehydrogenase(S)-1-Phenylethanol-DHCytochromecnmol substrate/min mg proteinnmol/mg proteinPeriplasmic752,400191.9Cytoplasmic1.830,000700.05Cells were grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate and ethylbenzene.

Open table in a new tab Cells were grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate and ethylbenzene. Specific activities are given in units of 1 nmol substrate/min/mg protein. Mean values of at least two measurements are given. Standard deviations were <14%. Because ethylbenzene dehydrogenase did not bind to DEAE-Sepharose columns when 10 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) was used, the elution buffer was changed to a chloride-free 2 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.5). Under these conditions, the enzyme bound to the DEAE-column and was then eluted from the column by a linear KCl gradient. Although enzyme activity in extracts was not affected by air, enriched enzyme from the first column quickly lost activity under oxic conditions. Therefore, purification of the enzyme was performed under anoxic conditions, which resulted in typical yields of >75% and an enrichment factor of 20 after the first column (TableII). Chromatography on ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) was performed as second purification step. The pooled enzyme eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column was applied directly on this column and eluted by a linear potassium phosphate gradient (pH 7.5). A typical enrichment factor of 24 at a yield of 20% was obtained after this step. The enzyme was essentially pure after the second column, as shown by SDS-PAGE. A summary of the purification scheme is given in TableIII. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase consists of three subunits of 96, 43, and 23 kDa, as revealed by SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme (Fig. 3). The apparent native molecular mass of the enzyme was determined as 155 ± 15 kDa by gel filtration and Ferguson plot analysis of native polyacrylamide gels. These values are consistent with an assumed αβγ composition of the enzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the three subunits were determined from enzyme that had been separated by SDS-PAGE. The N terminus of the α subunit of purified ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was blocked, whereas short sequences of the β and γ subunits were obtained. However, a sequence of the α subunit was obtained when the ethylbenzene-induced 96-kDa polypeptide was cut out from blotted cell extracts and used for sequencing. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the α subunit (GTKAPGYASWEDIYRKEWKWDKVN) was highly similar to that of other molybdoproteins such as selenate reductase of Thauera selenatis (63% identity) or several nitrate reductases (e.g. 63% identity with nitrate reductase subunit 1 of Haloarcula marismortui). The sequences obtained for the other subunits (β,XGPXXYLRP; and γ, XKAKRVPGGKELLLDL) did not show significant matches with known proteins. Additionally, molar contents of molybdenum, iron, and acid-labile sulfide were determined in purified ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. Molybdenum content in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was determined as 0.9 ± 0.1 mol (mol of enzyme)−1 by colorimetric assay, and as 1.2 ± 0.1 mol (mol of enzyme)−1 by ICP-OES. Iron was determined chemically at a stoichiometry of 17 ± 2 mol (mol of enzyme)−1 compared with 16 ± 1 mol of iron (mol of enzyme)−1 determined by ICP-OES. Finally, colorimetric analysis of acid-labile sulfide yielded 12 ± 4 mol S2− (mol of enzyme)−1. These values are consistent with the presence of one molybdenum, four [Fe4S4] clusters, and one heme in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase, as reported previously for selenate reductase of T. selenatis (19Schröder I. Rech S. Krafft T. Macy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23765-23768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Krafft T. Bowen A. Theis F. Macy J.M. DNA Seq. 2000; 10: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other metals detected by ICP-OES in significant amounts were magnesium and calcium (2.5 mol/mol each), but no further transition metals or selenium were present in purified enzyme. UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of purified ethylbenzene dehydrogenase showed a complex spectrum. The spectrum of the purified enzyme showed a shoulder around 400 nm and distinct absorption maxima at 424, 528, and 559 nm, which indicated the presence of a reduced heme b cofactor. After anaerobic oxidation of the enzyme by stoichiometric concentrations of ferricenium hexafluorophosphate, the α and β peaks of the tentatively identified heme at 559 and 528 nm disappeared, and the Soret band at 424 nm was shifted to 414 nm (Fig.4). The difference spectrum of reduced and oxidized enzyme was indeed indicative of the presence of a heme b cofactor (Fig. 4). Addition of stoichiometric concentrations of ethylbenzene to ferricenium-oxidized enzyme resulted in restoration of the spectrum of reduced enzyme (Fig. 4). The spectra of the substrate-reduced enzyme and the enzyme obtained from the final column were identical, suggesting that ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was purified in the completely reduced form. Treatment of the reduced enzyme with 0.2 mm dithionite did not result in further reduction of the heme cofactor but resulted in further bleaching of the absorption between 400 and 500 nm (Fig. 4). This is indicative of the presence of iron-sulfur clusters in ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. These clusters are obviously not completely reduced by the substrate and need a strong chemical reductant such as dithionite for being entirely reduced. The heme content of the enzyme was determined as 0.95 mol/mol from dithionite-reduced enzyme, using an ε of 34.7 mm−1 cm−1for the α band (21Hanlon S.P. Toh T.-H. Solomon P.S. Holt R.A. McEwan A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purified ethylbenzene dehydrogenase catalyzed the ferricenium-dependent oxidation of ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol. The specific activity recorded for purified enzyme corresponds to a very low catalytic number of 1.2 s−1, a value similar to that recorded for benzoyl-CoA reductase and phenylacetyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase fromThauera aromatica (22Boll M. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 921-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 23Rhee S.-K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity was already saturated at extremely low ethylbenzene concentrations, which prevented the accurate determination of theK m value for ethylbenzene. An approximation of <2 μm for the K m value was derived from the residual substrate concentration under half-saturating turnover conditions (for estimation, see Fig. 5). About 15% of the activity recorded with ethylbenzene was obtained whenn-propylbenzene was used as substrate. The ratio of activities with the two substrates did not change significantly between cell extract and purified enzyme. Other aromatic substrates, such as toluene, p-cymene, phenylacetate, (R,S)-1-phenylethanol or 2-phenylethanol, were not oxidized by ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. The potential of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase to catalyze the reversed reaction was tested by an anaerobic enzyme assay with reduced methyl viologen as electron donor and (S)-1-phenylethanol as starting substrate. No reduction of (S)-1-phenylethanol to ethylbenzene was detected by this test, suggesting that the reaction of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is irreversible under physiological conditions. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase also did not catalyze methyl viologen-dependent reduction of selenate or nitrate, despite the strong similarity of the N-terminal sequences of the respective α subunits. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was not inhibited in assays containing sodium azide or sodium cyanide (1 mm each). Addition of cyanide to the assay buffer caused a strong nonenzymatic background reaction, probably by sequestering iron from the ferricenium into a cyanide complex, but enzyme activities were still measurable reliably after starting with ethylbenzene. Whereas ethylbenzene dehydrogenase activity in cell extracts was not affected by aerobic extract preparation and incubation in air for up to 12 h, purified enzyme, which was apparently in the reduced state (see above), was inactivated irreversibly by incubation in air with a half-life time of 7 min. This inactivation was prevented efficiently by addition of the artificial electron acceptor ferricenium hexafluorophosphate (1 mm) to the enzyme preparations. Under these conditions, >90% of the enzyme activity was still present after 2 h and >70% after a 6-h incubation in air. Because ferricenium has been shown to convert the heme cofactor of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase to the oxidized form, it can be concluded that the reduced heme is most likely responsible for inactivation by oxygen. The enzyme is probably held oxidized in cell extracts by natural electron acceptors and acquires oxygen sensitivity when these electron acceptors are removed during purification. The pathway of anaerobic ethylbenzene metabolism is initiated by two consecutive two-electron oxidation steps of ethylbenzene to (S)-1-phenylethanol and further to acetophenone (1Ball H.A. Johnson H.A. Reinhard M. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Rabus R. Widdel F. Arch.

In this study, we analyzed the first enzyme of the predicted pathway, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase. To our knowledge, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is the first described enzyme that catalyzes oxygen-independent hydroxylation of a hydrocarbon, namely, of an apolar compound without functional groups. Enantiomer specificity of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was demonstrated by coupling the reaction to that of purified (S)-1-phenylethanol dehydrogenase. This matches the product reported previously for a differentAzoarcus strain (4Johnson H.A. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase was induced specifically in cells grown anaerobically on ethylbenzene, and only very low activities were measured in cells grown on 1-phenylethanol or acetophenone. Three of the ethylbenzene-induced polypeptides described in this study showed molecular masses identical to those of the subunits of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase (96, 44, and 23 kDa). Cells of the ethylbenzene-metabolizing strain EbN1 contained an enzyme exhibiting n-propylbenzene dehydrogenase activity at 15% of the specific activity measured with ethylbenzene. In contrast, cells of the ethylbenzene and n-propylbenzene-metabolizing strain PbN1 contained an enzyme exhibiting high activity with either ethylbenzene or n-propylbenzene. Similar ratios of activity with the two hydrocarbons in cells grown on either substrate strongly suggest that the same enzyme is used for metabolism of ethylbenzene andn-propylbenzene. This assumption is supported by the apparent identity of the polypeptide patterns of ethylbenzene ann-propylbenzene grown cells. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase showed no activity with toluene as substrate, which is consistent with previous observations that strain EbN1 catabolizes toluene via a completely different pathway, namely, the addition of the methyl group to fumarate (5Heider J. Spormann A.M. Beller H.R. Widdel F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 459-473Crossref Google Scholar, 6Biegert T. Fuchs G. Heider J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 7Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The present data suggest that ethylbenzene oxidation occurs in the periplasm, whereas the product, (S)-1-phenylethanol, is oxidized further in the cytoplasm, as evident from the use of NAD+ as electron acceptor. It is unknown presently whether and how 1-phenylethanol is transported into the cytoplasm. A passive diffusion of 1-phenylethanol as a hydrophobic compound via the cytoplasmic membrane appears principally possible. The advantage of a periplasmic location of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase for the organism is unknown. One may speculate that scavenging of the poorly water-soluble ethylbenzene is more effective outside of the cytoplasmic membrane. The low K m value (<2 μm) of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase supports the assumption that the capacity of the enzyme for effective substrate binding is an important factor in the metabolism of this hydrocarbon. Even though the redox potential of the 1-phenylethanol/ethylbenzene couple is around +0.03 V relative to standard hydrogen electrode (estimated from thermodynamic data of other hypothetical alcohol/hydrocarbon couples), ethylbenzene oxidation was only observed in this study with an electron acceptor of significantly higher redox potential (ferricenium/ferrocene, E 0 = +0.38 V). One may assume that redox centers in the enzyme as well as the natural electron acceptor have high redox potentials to achieve reasonable oxidation rates with the relatively inert hydrocarbon substrate. Redox centers of high midpoint potential in the enzyme may offer a possible explanation for the observed irreversibility of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation, even in tests with strongly reducing electron donors (e.g. methyl viologen+/methyl viologen,E 0 = −0.446 V). Because ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is a periplasmic enzyme, a possible natural acceptor in the Azoarcus strains could be cytochrome c. The properties of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase from strain EbN1 are in contrast to the recently reported benzoquinone dependence of ethylbenzene oxidation in strain EB-1. Reaction rates in this strain were 3-fold lower than those reported here, and the enzyme was membrane-associated and not induced in ethylbenzene-grown cells (4Johnson H.A. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5662-5668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, there are different types of ethylbenzene dehydrogenases in different strains of denitrifiers. Ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is a new molybdenum/iron-sulfur/heme enzyme, which is composed of three subunits. In analogy to other known three-subunit molybdoenzymes, it may be assumed that the α subunit contains the molybdenum cofactor; the β subunit carries the Fe/S clusters; and the γ subunit, the heme cofactor. The enzyme, which is most similar to ethylbenzene dehydrogenase with respect to subunit composition, cofactor content and location, is presumably the recently characterized selenate reductase from a closely related species,T. selenatis (19Schröder I. Rech S. Krafft T. Macy J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23765-23768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Krafft T. Bowen A. Theis F. Macy J.M. DNA Seq. 2000; 10: 365-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase did not catalyze reduction of selenate or nitrate. Another recently characterized molybdoprotein, phenylacetyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase from T. aromatica, catalyzes a similar dehydrogenation reaction with a polar aromatic substrate, but this enzyme is membrane-bound, devoid of a heme cofactor, and apparently catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of phenylacetyl-CoA to phenylglyoxylate, with coupling to quinones and without release of intermediates (23Rhee S.-K. Fuchs G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A striking finding is the discrepancy between the stability of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase under air in cell extracts and the fast inactivation of the purified enzyme by oxygen. We showed that the enzyme becomes relatively insensitive to air by anaerobic oxidation of the heme b cofactor, suggesting that the fully reduced heme in the enzyme may generate damaging oxygen metabolites. In cell extract, ethylbenzene dehydrogenase is probably kept oxidized by interaction with its natural electron acceptor and only becomes reduced when the electron acceptor is removed during purification.

Dermatol. 1993; 101: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Cooney R. Iocono J. Maish G. Smith J.S. Ehrlich P. J. Trauma. 1997; 42: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a lack of TNF-α was found to be associated with hypertrophic scars (5Kitzis V. Engrav L.H. Quinn L.S. J. Surg.

Burns. 1994; 20: 118-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suggests that misregulated TNF-α results in disordered wound healing. Similarly, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a component of normal wound healing (7Beck L.S. Chen T.L. Mikalauski P. Ammann A.J. Growth Factors. 1990; 3: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 8Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2565-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Increased TGF-β is associated with hypertrophic scar and fibrosis (9Ghahary A. Shen Y.J. Scott P.G. Gong Y. Tredget E.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 122: 465-473PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang K. Garner W. Cohen L. Rodriguez J. Phan S. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 750-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In addition, accumulating evidence has suggested a role for inflammatory cytokines in promoting tumor metastasis, although the mechanism is not clarified (11Malik S.T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roberts A.B. Thompson N.L. Heine U. Flanders C. Sporn M.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1988; 57: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The roles for these mediators in the regulation of extracellular matrix may relate to the spectrum of genes they induce and appear to share a common theme of tissue remodeling. Compelling evidence has documented the role of matrix metalloproteinases in the remodeling of connective tissue during angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, and tissue repair (13Parks W.C. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Of the growing family of MMPs, MMP-2 (gelatinase A, 72-kDa type IV collagenase, EC3.4.24.24) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B, 92-kDa type IV collagenase, EC3.4.24.35) are unique for their fibronectin-like collagen binding domains (14Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteases. Academic Press, New York1995: 115-148Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-9 are thought to be responsible for detaching basal keratinocytes from the basement membrane and thus promote their migration to cover exposed connective tissue (15Salo T. Makela M. Kylmaniemi M. Autio-Harmainen H. Larjava H. Lab. Invest. 1994; 70: 176-182PubMed Google Scholar, 16Murphy G. Ward R. Hembry R.M. Reynolds J.J. Kuhn K. Tryggvason K. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This notion is based on their restricted expression pattern at the wound edge and their substrate preference for basement membrane, type IV collagen. In addition, the type IV collagenases may also degrade type VII collagen, the major collagen component of anchoring fibrils essential for the attachment of the epidermis to the dermis, (17Karelina T.V. Bannikov G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 371-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Seltzer J.L. Eisen A.Z. Bauer E.A. Morris N.P. Glanville R.W. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3822-3826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the actual functions of the type IV collagenases in normal physiologic processes are not clear, accumulated evidence has linked them to many diseases. Excessive type IV collagenase activity is associated with non-healing chronic wounds where it is thought that type IV collagen is over-digested during re-epithelialization (19Moses M.A. Marikovsky M. Harper J.W. Vogt P. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Langer R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Tarlton J.F. Bailey A.J. Crawford E. Jones D. Moore K. Harding K.D. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with this fact, low levels of MMP-9 were found in hypertrophic scars where collagen is over-deposited (21Neely A.N. Clendening C.E. Gardner J. Greenhalgh D.G. Warden G.D. Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The expression of pro-MMP-9 is regulated by many soluble mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β, the ECM, oncogenes, and tumor promoters (22Okada Y. Tsuchiya H. Shimizu H. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Sato H. Seiki M. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 23Lyons J.G. Birkedal-Hansen B. Pierson M.C. Whitelock J.M.

After secretion into the ECM, the activity of MMP-9 can be further regulated by specific tissue inhibitors and by proteolytic activation via removal of the amino-terminal inhibitory domain. Most of the previous investigations on cytokine-mediated MMP-9 expression utilized tumor or transformed cell lines in which the mitogenic signaling and the cell cycle machinery are constitutively active. In chronic wounds and some invasive cancer tissue the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9 is processed into the active 82-kDa form (26Wysocki A.B. Staiano-Coico L. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zeng Z.S. Guillem J.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Rha S.Y. Kim J.H. Roh J.K. Lee K.S. Min J.S. Kim B.S. Chung H.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 43: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the molecular regulation of expression and proteolytic activation of MMP-9 in these pathologic situations. Because multiple cytokines are coordinately present in wound sites, we have studied the interaction of multiple cytokines on MMP-9 induction and its proteolytic activation in organ-cultured human skin. In the second phase of the study we dissected the cytokine-mediated MMP-9 regulation at the cellular level. We isolated dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes from human skin and examined the effect of cytokines on MMP-9 regulation. Finally, we investigated the cytokine-responsive cis-elements in the promoter of the human MMP-9 gene to identify the molecular target sites of such regulation. In a previous report we demonstrated that exposure of human skin to TNF-α led to activation of the pro-MMP-2, and such proteolytic activation could be reconstructed by embedding the dermal fibroblasts in collagen lattices (29Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Wu H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we extend our findings by showing that the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9 is induced in human skin by TGF-β, and this induction is additively enhanced by a second signal from TNF-α. In addition, we found that the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9 is converted to the 82-kDa active form when organ-cultured skin is treated with TNF-α. Furthermore, we show here that the TNF-α-mediated pro-MMP-9 activation is caused by an unidentified factor that is tightly associated with skin tissue. Our cellular dissection experiments demonstrate that cytokine-mediated pro-MMP-9 induction in the human skin is due to dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. At the molecular level, we provide evidence showing that these two cytokines target their response elements in the 5′-promoter of the human MMP-9 gene. These findings represent the first demonstration for additive roles of TNF-α and TGF-β on the induction and activation of MMP-9 in human skin. Vitrogen containing 95% type I collagen was purchased from Cohesion Technologies (Palo Alto, CA). Cytokines were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The antibodies against MMP-9 (AB805) were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). The Immobilon-P was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.The gelatin was from Sigma. Gelatin-Sepharose 4B was purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNA was extracted by Trizol from Life Technologies, Inc. The reagents for reverse transcriptase-PCR were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The Platinum Taq DNA polymerase and oligodeoxynucleotide primers were from Life Technologies, Inc. KGM and KBM were from Clonetics. Quick-change site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). DNA sequencing was carried out at the University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Normal human skin was obtained from patients undergoing reconstructive or aesthetic surgery (University of Southern California IRB 999061). The full thickness skin was decontaminated by incubation in 2× antibiotic containing DMEM (200 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 200 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.5 μg/ml amphotericin B) at 4 °C overnight. Then the skin was cut into equal sizes with 0.5 cm on each side and incubated in DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2for 8 h. To decrease the effects of endogenous soluble factors in the skin induced by the harvesting process, the medium was changed three times during the 8-h incubation. Finally, the skin piece was immersed in 2 ml of DMEM with specific cytokines and was maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The conditioned media were sampled at the indicated times for gelatinolytic zymogram assay and Western blot as mentioned below. Dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated from full thickness human skin (3Garner W.L. Karmiol S. Rodriguez J.L. Smith Jr., D.J. Phan S.H. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 875-879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolated fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum with antibiotics. The keratinocytes were grown in complete KGM. Before exposure to cytokines the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM for fibroblasts and KBM, the basal medium, for keratinocytes. For some experiments the fibroblasts were embedded in collagen lattices (29Han Y.P. Tuan T.L. Wu H. Hughes M. Garner W.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed human keratinocytes (kindly provided by Dr. David Woodley, University of Southern California) were cultured in KGM to confluence. The cells were stimulated by 10 ng/ml TNF-α in KBM for 72 h in standard culture condition. In these conditions most of the gelatinase secreted in the medium is the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9. The conditioned media from 10 10-cm dishes were collected, and particulate debris was removed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min. The conditioned media were passed through a 1-ml gelatin-Sepharose 4B column followed by washing with 400 mmNaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bound gelatinase was eluted by 100 mm HCl and immediately neutralized by Tris base to pH 7.5. The explants of full thickness skin were stimulated with or without TNF-α at 10 ng/ml for 70 h in DMEM at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To test whether the TNF-α-mediated pro-MMP-9 activation occurred inside the skin tissue or by secreted factors, the explants were washed and re-cultured in fresh DMEM without cytokine. The original conditioned media from the 70-h stimulation and the conditioned media from the re-culture were incubated at 37 °C for additional 8–20 h and analyzed by gelatinolytic zymography. In another experiment, the TNF-α-treated skin explant was minced and then extracted using a buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, CaCl2at 0.2 g/liter, KCl at 0.4 g/liter, MgSO4 at 0.1 g/liter, NaCl at 6.4 g/liter, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. After a 5-h incubation at room temperature the Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. Purified pro-MMP-9 was added to these fractions and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h followed by the zymogram analysis. The conditioned media were mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer in the absence of reducing agent and electrophoresed in 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C with 120 V for 16 h. After electrophoresis, SDS in the gel was removed by incubation with 2.5% Triton X-100. Gelatinolytic activities were developed in buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 16 h at 37 °C. The gelatinolytic activities were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue R-250. The gelatinase from conditioned media was enriched by binding it to gelatin-conjugated Sepharose 4B. Briefly, 1 ml of conditioned media was incubated with 40 μl of gelatin-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h. The beads were washed four times with 0.4m NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bound protein was eluted with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer at the reducing condition. After SDS-PAGE, the protein was transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The protein blot was exposed to anti-human MMP-9 antibodies and followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies that were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The dermal fibroblasts were grown in 10-cm dishes until subconfluent. To induce quiescence in the cells, the dishes were washed with DMEM and incubated in serum-free DMEM for 4 h. For the titration experiment, the dishes were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and TGF-β (1 ng/ml) individually or in combination in DMEM for 20 h. For the time course experiment the cells were stimulated by a combination of TNF-α with TGF-β and harvested 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 20 h later. After the dishes were stimulated for the indicated time, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the total RNA was extracted by Trizol. RNA was quantified by measuring the adsorption at 260 nm. 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase with 1 μg of random deoxynucleotide hexamer in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 mmdNTP. After completion of the 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated via heating to 94 °C for 3 min. The annealing temperature for amplification of human MMP-9 and β-actin was 64 °C (ROBOCYCLER, Stratagene). The PCR amplification was performed with platinum Taq DNA polymerase for 30 cycles. The product was resolved in agarose gel (1.8%), followed by staining with ethidium bromide, and recorded by digital camera. The relative density of the products was quantitated by the Alpha imaging system. The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were adapted from a previous report (30Platzer C. Blankenstein T. Cytokines; A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1995: 57-68Google Scholar, 31Janowska-Wieczorek A. Marquez L.A. Matsuzaki A. Hashmi H.R. Larratt L.M. Boshkov L.M. Turner A.R. Zhang M.C. Edwards D.R. Kossakowska A.E. Br. J. Haematol. 1999; 105: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The predicted PCR product size for β-actin and for MMP-9 is 548 and 479 bp, respectively. The identity of the PCR product for MMP-9 was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California). DNA fragments containing the 5′-region of the humanMMP-9 gene and the NF-κB-response elements were inserted into pBLCAT2 (32Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The wild type NF-κB reporter plasmid, pNFκB3x-CAT, was constructed by inserting an enhancer element into pBLCAT2 at HindIII/BamHI sites. The insertion fragment consists of a triple tandem repeat of the NF-κB consensus binding site with the sequence of 5′-AGC TTG GGA CTT TCC GGG ACT TTC CGG GAC TTT CCG GAT CC-3′ (Promega). An NF-κB enhancer mutant, pNFκBm3x-CAT, was constructed by insertion of the adapter (5′-AGC TGT ACA CTT TCC TAC ACT TTCC TAC ACT TTC CG-3′) into pBLCAT2. The plasmid containing the wild type 670-bp upstream region of humanMMP-9 gene was a gracious gift of Drs. Sato and Boyd (33Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Gum R. Lengyel E. Juarez J. Chen J.H. Sato H. Seiki M. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10672-10680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To facilitate reconstruction, the entire 670-bp promoter was inserted into pBLCAT2 and named as pM9–670-CAT. Briefly, the 670-bp promoter was amplified by PCR with the forward primer 5′-AAG CTT CTA GAG GCT ACT GTC CCC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCT AGA GGT GTC TGA CTG CAG GTG-3′. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO, an intermediate vector (Invitrogen). Finally, the insert from the TOPO vector was inserted into pBLCAT2. A p65 NF-κB consensus binding site at −601 was characterized previously (35Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). Scanning the 670-bp promoter for potential transcription factor binding sites, we noticed a consensus p50 NF-κB-binding site located at −328 from the transcription start site (MatInspector version 2.2, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health). A p65 NF-κB enhancer deletion construct, pM9–590-CAT, that contains the 590-bp region upstream from the transcription start site was created. This construct was generated by PCR with a forward primer 5′-AAG CTT AGC CTT GCC TAG CAG AGC CCA TTC-3′ and a backward primer 5′-TCT AGA GGT GTC TGA CTG CAG GTG-3′. Another deletion construct, pM9–460-CAT, was generated by deleting the p65 NF-κB and the potential TGF-β-response element (TRE) (−474). This plasmid was constructed by digesting pM9–670-CAT withHindIII and EcoR V, filling-in, and self re-ligation. A mutation construct in the TRE, pM9–670-mTRE-CAT, was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. Briefly, the TRE mutation was generated by PCR using sequencing grade Taq DNA polymerase with a forward primer 5′-AAG CTT CTA GAG GCT ACT GTC CCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTC AGA TAT CCT CCC CTG ATC ACT CCC CAC ACT-3′. In this TRE mutant the wild type sequence 5′-AGGTTTGGGGA-3′ was substituted by 5′-TGATCAGGGGA-3′ (the mutant bases are underlined). The PCR product was ligated to pCR2.1-TOPO vector. Then the 200-bp HindIII/EcoRV fragment from the wild type pM9–670-CAT was replaced by the mutant version. Finally, we created a site-directed mutant at the potential p50 NF-κB-binding region (−328/−319) and named it pM9–670-mp50-CAT. This was accomplished by the QuickChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with the following primer: 5′-TCA GAC CAA GGG ATGAAG GAT AAC TCC AGC TTC ATC CCC CTC CC-3′ (the mismatched four nucleotides are underlined). The insertion fragments of the wild type, the mutant pM9–670mTRE-CAT, and mutant pM9–670-mp50-CAT were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California). The early passages of human dermal fibroblasts were seeded in 6-cm dishes. Transfection was conducted with 0.5-μg plasmid and LipofectAMINE-PLUS according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation for 3 h the plasmid complex was removed and replaced with 0.5% fetal bovine serum/DMEM, and then cytokines were added (TNF-α at 10 ng/ml and TGF-β 1 ng/ml). For the time course experiment the cells were harvested at 24, 48, and 60 h post-transfection. For promoter analysis experiments most of the transfection times were 62 h. The cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 400-μl 0.25 mTris at pH 8.0 buffer. The cells were lysed via three rounds of quick freeze and thaw followed by heating for 10 min at 60 °C. The extracts were briefly centrifuged, and the supernatant was harvested for the CAT assay. The reaction was performed in a 125-μl system with 50 μl of lysate, 1 μl of [14-C]chloramphenicol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1.9 MBq/ml), 5 μl of 10 mmbutyl-CoA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 69 μl of the 0.25m Tris, pH 8.0. After incubating at 37 °C for 14 h, the lipid phase was extracted by chloroform. The products were resolved by silica gel TLC (Whatman) with 3% methanol and 97% chloroform. The acetylated products were detected by PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics). To establish the profile of cytokine-exerted MMP-9 induction and activation, we first utilized organ culture of human skin. Normal human skin, discarded after reconstructive surgery, was cultured in serum-free DMEM and exposed to TNF-α and TGF-β either individually or combined (10 ng/ml for TNF-α and 1 ng/ml for TGF-β). The conditioned media were sampled at the indicated time points. The resultant conditioned media were assayed for type IV collagenase activity by gelatinolytic zymography. In the absence of exogenous cytokine, minimal 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity was present in the conditioned medium after culturing for 72 h (Fig.1 A). Treatment of the skin with TNF-α induced a small increase of the 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity. Remarkably, in the presence of TNF-α, the 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity progressively disappeared with a concomitant increase in the 82-kDa gelatinolytic activity. The 92- and 82-kDa gelatinolytic activities were confirmed as MMP-9 by Western blot (Fig.1 B). In contrast, exposure of the skin to TGF-β markedly induced the 92-kDa pro-MMP-9. Unlike the response to TNF-α, TGF-β failed to promote MMP-9 proteolytic activation to the 82-kDa form. When both cytokines were applied, a synergistic induction of pro-MMP-9 was detectable at 48 h. Furthermore, simultaneous exposure to the two cytokines led to substantial conversion of the pro-MMP-9 to the active form. After cultivation with the two cytokines for 96 h, most of the pro-MMP-9 was converted to the active 82-kDa active form. Clinical investigations have outlined a temporal pattern for pro-MMP-9 expression and activation in normal healing cutaneous wound sites. Persistent elevation of MMP-9 was found in association with chronic wounds (36Young P.K. Grinnell F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 660-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Tarlton J.F. Vickery C.J. Leaper D.J. Bailey A.J. Br. J.

Wound Repair Regen. 1999; 7: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, causal factors to induce and activate the proteinase in human tissue at wound sites are still obscure. Our findings reported here show a specific role for the inflammatory cytokines in the induction and activation of MMP-9 in human tissue. The next question was dissecting the nature of the TNF-α-induced activation of pro-MMP-9 in the organ-cultured human skin and whether activation is performed by a skin-associated factor or a secreted soluble factor. The skin explants were stimulated with or without TNF-α for 70 h, and the conditioned media were collected. The treated explants were washed and re-plated in fresh DMEM without additional cytokine. The previous conditioned medium and the re-plated culture were incubated at 37 °C and sampled at 0, 8, and 20 h (Fig. 2). As shown by zymography, the 82-kDa MMP-9 was generated by direct contact with the skin tissue but not by incubation with the conditioned medium. Next, we attempted to extract the pro-MMP-9 activator from the TNF-α-treated skin. The TNF-α-treated explant was extracted by nonionic detergent, Triton X-100. Purified pro-MMP-9 was added to the Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions and incubated for 20 h (Fig.3). The results show that pro-MMP-9 is processed to the 82-kDa form in the Triton-insoluble fraction, which suggests that the unidentified pro-MMP-9 activator is tightly associated with the tissue structure.Figure 3Proteolytic activation of pro-MMP-9 in the cell-free skin extract. Adult human skin was stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) in DMEM for 70 h. The tissue was washed and minced following extraction using 2% Triton X-100 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation. Purified pro-MMP-9 was added or not to these fractions and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. MMP-9 activities were measured by gelatinolytic zymogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To understand the cellular mechanism of the cytokine-mediated induction and activation of pro-MMP-9 from intact skin, we studied the MMP profile in isolated dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes. The dermal environment was simulated by embedding the fibroblasts in three-dimensional type I collagen lattices. Individual cytokines including TNF-α, TGF-β1, PDGF-AB, EGF, IL-8, and IL-6 were applied at 10 ng/ml in the serum-free culture medium. In another panel, a combination of TGF-β with other cytokines was applied to the cells. After culturing for 68 h, the conditioned media were analyzed for gelatinolytic activity (Fig.4 A). The results show that TNF-α alone could moderately induce the 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity, and the other cytokines in the list did not induce the 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity. Remarkably, the combin"
https://openalex.org/W1606563555,"Manganese-superoxide dismutase (Sod2) removes mitochondrially derived superoxide (O⨪2) at near-diffusion limiting rates and is the only antioxidant enzyme whose expression is regulated by numerous stimuli. Here it is shown thatSod2 also serves as a source of the intracellular signaling molecule H2O2.Sod2-dependent increases in the steady-state levels of H2O2 led to ERK1/2 activation and subsequent downstream transcriptional increases in matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) expression, which were reversed by expression of the H2O2-detoxifying enzyme, catalase. In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism has recently been identified (1G/2G) at base pair −1607 that creates an Ets site adjacent to an AP-1 site at base pair −1602 and has been shown to dramatically enhance transcription of the MMP-1 promoter. Luciferase promoter constructs containing either the 1G or 2G variation were 25- or 1000-fold more active when transiently transfected intoSod2-overexpressing cell lines, respectively. The levels of MMP-2, -3, and -7 were also increased in theSod2-overexpressing cell lines, suggesting thatSod2 may function as a “global” redox regulator of MMP expression. In addition, Sod2 − /+mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to respond to the cytokine-mediated induction of the murine functional analog of MMP-1, MMP-13. This study provides evidence that the modulation of Sod2 activity by a wide array of pathogenic and inflammatory stimuli may be utilized by the cell as a primary signaling mechanism leading to matrix metalloproteinase expression.

In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism has recently been identified (1G/2G) at base pair −1607 that creates an Ets site adjacent to an AP-1 site at base pair −1602 and has been shown to dramatically enhance transcription of the MMP-1 promoter. Luciferase promoter constructs containing either the 1G or 2G variation were 25- or 1000-fold more active when transiently transfected intoSod2-overexpressing cell lines, respectively. The levels of MMP-2, -3, and -7 were also increased in theSod2-overexpressing cell lines, suggesting thatSod2 may function as a “global” redox regulator of MMP expression. In addition, Sod2 − /+mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to respond to the cytokine-mediated induction of the murine functional analog of MMP-1, MMP-13. This study provides evidence that the modulation of Sod2 activity by a wide array of pathogenic and inflammatory stimuli may be utilized by the cell as a primary signaling mechanism leading to matrix metalloproteinase expression. Reactive oxygen species are constantly generated in aerobic organisms during normal metabolism as well as in response to both internal and external stimuli. Although low levels of reactive oxygen species are indispensable in several physiological processes ranging from cell proliferation to apoptosis, high levels of reactive oxygen species and their inefficient removal result in oxidative stress that can be potentially toxic to the cells. An imbalance in reactive oxygen species has been hypothesized to play a causative role in many disease pathologies, including cancer (1Cerutti P.A. Science. 1985; 227: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar), ischemia/reperfusion injury (2McCord J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 312: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar), degenerative diseases such as photoaging (3Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), atherosclerosis (4Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Rice-Evans C.A. Burdon R.H. Free Radical Damage and its Control. Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd., Oxford1994Google Scholar), osteoarthritis and neurodegeneration (5Weber G.F. T Med. Hypotheses. 1994; 43: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A feature often associated with these diseases is a malfunctioning of the connective tissue remodeling process due to increased activity of extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases (MMPs).1 The matrix metalloproteinase family is composed of at least 20 zinc-dependent extracellular endopeptidases that are primarily expressed as inactive precursors or zymogens (6Woessner Jr., J.F. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). MMP expression is low in normal tissues and is induced when extracellular matrix remodeling is required; in all the above-mentioned disease pathologies and during senescence, there is a coincident increase in the production of reactive oxygen species and MMPs. The mitochondrial manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (Sod2) is one of the numerous enzymatic and non-enzymatic defenses that exist to combat oxidant injury. Sod2 catalyzes the diffusion-limited removal of superoxide to H2O2 at its site of production. It has recently been shown that the Sod2-dependent production of H2O2 leads to the expression of MMP-1 (7Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Wlaschek M. Poswig A. Briviba K. Oberley T.D. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25869-25876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, Sod2 (CD1Sod2 tm1Cje) heterozygous knockout mice develop premature interstitial fibrosis and accumulate collagen when compared with wild-type age-matched controls (8Day B.J. Melov S. Wallace D.C. Crapo J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: S59Google Scholar). Whether the accumulation of collagen in theSod2 − /+ mice is due to increased collagen synthesis or degradation is not known. These observations have led us to evaluate the importance of Sod2 in regulating the expression of the collagen-degrading enzyme MMP-1. This study demonstrates that the Sod2-dependent H2O2 production leads to the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling cascade and subsequent downstream transcriptional increases in MMP-1 expression. Furthermore, a specific single nucleotide polymorphism sensitizes the MMP-1 promoter toSod2-dependent activation. Thus, the cell has evolved to utilize the mitochondria as an important source of the signaling molecule H2O2 via Sod2 and provides a mechanistic rationale for the increased expression ofSod2 and MMP in numerous disease pathologies. HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml neomycin in a 37 °C humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Constructions of recombinant Mn-SOD and catalase plasmids and transfections were previously described in detail (9Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18898-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Sod2-deficient mice (CD1Sod2 tm1Cje) were kindly provided by Drs. C. J. Epstein and T. T. Huang (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The fibroblasts were cultured individually in 50% Dulbeccos' modified Eagle's medium and 50% F-12 supplemented with 15 mm HEPES andl-glutamine (Fisher) and 10% fetal calf serum in 25-cm2 flasks in 3% oxygen. They were split 1:4 and passaged every 5 days. Cells were treated with recombinant human TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or mouse IL-1 (R&D Systems). A full-length 2.4-kilobase pair IL-1α sequence was PCR-amplified with NotI-XbaI ends from an HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell cDNA library. The resulting product was inserted into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). A 2.4-kilobase pair fragment containing the full-length IL-1α sequence was then removed from the resulting plasmid by digestion withNotI and XbaI. This fragment was ligated into pRCMV, precut with NotI and XbaI. The pRCMV/IL-1α construct was sequenced bidirectionally using theTaq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Model 310 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of the plasmids and LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. HT-1080 cells were washed, and 0.8 ml of serum-free MEM was added per well. The DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus complexes were added to the medium and incubated at 37 °C. After 3 h, 0.8 ml of MEM with 20% fetal calf serum was added, and the cells were grown overnight. The next day, the cells were diluted 1:4 and transferred to a 75-cm2 flask. After incubation overnight, selective medium was added containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mg/ml neomycin; 10 days later, resistant cells were harvested, and ∼100 cells were plated in a 75-cm2 flask. The cells were grown until visible colonies were observed. Single colonies were transferred to 24-well plates for further characterization. IL-1α immunoblot analysis was performed using a rabbit anti-human IL-1α polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cell lines were grown to confluence in 25-cm2 culture flasks, and treatments were performed as described in the figure legends. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified spectrophotometrically. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (11Gorospe M. Kumar S. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6214-6220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To normalize for RNA loading and transfer, the membrane was hybridized to a GAPDH or actin probe. The human MMP-1, a probe 1.3-kilobase pair fragment, was isolated from plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. G. I. Goldberg (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). All other Northern probes were made as described in detail by Dumin et al. (12Dumin J. Wilcox B.D. Otterness I. Melendez J.A. Huang C. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25488-25494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analyses of MMP-1 and Sod2 were carried out as described by Melendez and Davies (9Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18898-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. GAPDH was co-amplified in the linear amplification range as a loading control. The primers used for the PCR amplification were designed by utilizing OLIGO primer analysis software (National Biosciences, Inc.). The primers were as follows: human 5′-MMP-1, 5′-GGAGGAAATCTTGCTCAT-3′; human 3′-MMP-1, 5′ CTCAGAAAGAGCAGCATC-3′; 5′-GAPDH, 5′ CATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′; 3′-GAPDH, 5′-TCTCTTCCTCTT GTGCTCTTG-3′; 5′-SOD2, 5′-TCCCCGACCTGCCCTACGAC-3′; and 3′-SOD2, 5′-CATTCTC CCAG- TTGATTACAT-3′. Cell lines were transiently cotransfected with the pGL3-MMP-1(1G) or pGL3-MMP-1(2G) construct (13Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar) and pCMV.SPORTβ-gal using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed 18 h post-transfection, and the luciferase reporter activity was determined using the Promega assay system. Construction of the expression vectors, characterization of the cell lines, and FACScan analysis of DCF fluorescence were performed as described in detail by Rodriguez et al. (14Rodriguez A.M. Carrico P.M. Mazurkiewicz J.E. Melendez J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Control (CMV) cells at 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free MEM for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with 20% fetal calf serum for 15 min, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and placed on ice. The cells were lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice with 400 μl of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm KCl), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), phosphatase inhibitors (0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 20 mm sodium fluoride), 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 1 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Extracted proteins were then quantified using the BCA protein reagent (Pierce). 40 μg of denatured protein in 5% 2-mercaptoethanol was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) at 100 V for 1 h. The membranes were then blocked for 2 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody (mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20. This was followed by incubation with secondary antibody (biotinylated anti-mouse IgG) at 1:50,000 for 2 h at room temperature. Detection of the phosphorylated forms of the protein was performed by the addition of the Vectastain EliteABC reagent, followed by Pierce Supersignal chemiluminescent substrate and exposure to Kodak X-Omat radiographic film. The immunoblot was then reprobed by incubation with standard stripping buffer for 15 min at 60 °C, washed twice, blocked, and then reprobed using rabbit polyclonal antibody (Promega) that recognizes ERK1/2 regardless of its phosphorylation state at a 1:1000 dilution. The blot was incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody (1:50,000 dilution), and the signal was detected as described above. Serum-free conditioned medium from cells at 80–90% confluence was prepared by washing two times with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by incubation with serum-free MEM. MMPs were concentrated from the serum-free conditioned medium by incubation with 250 μl of gelatin-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then centrifuged at 10,000 × gand eluted in electrophoresis sample buffer (final concentration of 2.25% SDS, 9% glycerol, and 45 mm Tris (pH 6.8), and bromphenol blue) by incubation for 30 min at room temperature, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 2 min. Equal volumes of the eluate were then resolved on a 10% nondenaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel impregnated with 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinolytic activities were measured as described elsewhere (15Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To establish whether the expression of MMP-1 is regulated bySod2, we first measured the levels of MMP-1 in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines designed to overexpress Sod2utilizing RT-PCR (10Bai J. Rodriguez A.M. Melendez J.A. Cederbaum A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Sod2 by 15-fold resulted in a dramatic increase in both the basal expression of the MMP-1 mRNA and the steady-state concentrations of H2O2, both of which were reversed upon coexpression of catalase in either the cytosolic or mitochondrial compartment (Fig. 1, A andB). The addition of O⨪2-generating compounds was not required to increase the production of H2O2. The increase in the steady-state levels of H2O2 was also associated with a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione from 2.01 ± 0.37 to 1.22 ± 0.16 (p < 0.05), an indicator of the oxidant-buffering capacity of the cell (data not shown). Thus, a 15-fold increase in Sod2 levels, which is well within the range of activity observed in response to cytokines and growth factors, can enhance MMP-1 expression in an H2O2-dependent fashion. Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-1α is a potent inducer of MMP-1 in many biological systems (16Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar) and is modulated by reactive oxygen species (9Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18898-18903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Analysis of IL-1α levels inSod2-overexpressing cells showed a 3-fold increase in basal IL-1α levels that was reversed when catalase was coexpressed in these cell lines (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether IL-1α was responsible for theSod2-dependent changes in MMP-1 gene expression,Sod2-overexpressing cells were treated with a concentration of IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) that has previously been shown to block the IL-1-mediated induction of MMP-1 (18Wilcox B.D. Dumin J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29658-29664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither acute nor chronic treatment of the HT15 cell line with IL-1RA was effective in decreasing the expression of MMP-1 (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, in contrast to many other mesenchymal cells, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells did not respond to IL-1α by increasing the expression of MMP-1 (Fig.2 C, upper panel). It is nevertheless possible that intracellular IL-1α modulates the expression of MMP-1 since intracellular pro-IL-1α is constitutively active (19Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address this question, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells were transfected with an IL-1α expression vector. Cloned transfectants with levels of IL-1 mRNA and protein that were equivalent to those observed uponSod2 overexpression showed no increase in basal MMP-1 expression (Fig. 2 C, middle and lower panels). Thus, Sod2 overexpression alone is sufficient to signal MMP-1 expression. To further establish the linkage between Sod2 and the expression of MMP-1, MEFs derived from Sod2-deficient mice (CD1Sod2 tm1Cje) were analyzed for the expression of MMP-13 mRNA (a mouse functional analog of human MMP-1) in response to numerous stimuli (20Huang T.T. Yasunami M. Carlson E.J. Gillespie A.M. Reaume A.G. Hoffman E.K. Chan P.H. Scott R.W. Epstein C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As analyzed by Northern blotting, the wild-type MEFs responded to the induction of MMP-13 by TNF, whereas the heterozygotes did not. This response was also shown to be specific for MMP-13 since the induction of IL-6 and IL-1 by TNF was unaffected by the loss of Sod2 activity (Fig.3 C). This suggests that Mn-SOD may be required for the TNF-mediated induction of MMP-13. To determine if Mn-SOD was also involved in signaling the expression of MMP-13 by other stimuli, Sod2 +/+ andSod2 − /+ MEFs were treated with either IL-1 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The induction of MMP-13 by IL-1α and phorbol myristate acetate was severely impaired in the Sod2 − /+ fibroblasts compared with the Sod2 +/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 3,A and B). To validate the genetic background of the MEFs, RT-PCR analysis was performed to monitor Mn-SOD mRNA content (Fig. 3 D). RT-PCR analysis produced the expected size product in the Sod2 +/+ MEFs, whereas theSod2 − /+ MEFs produced two products. The lower size band reflects the targeted disruption of exon 3 in one of the Mn-SOD alleles. Mn-SOD activity levels also reflect the genetic background of each of the cell lines (data not shown). Furthermore, Mn-SOD content had no effect on the induction of IL-6 by both TNF and IL-1α or on the levels of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3 D). Our data indicate that Mn-SOD plays an obligatory role in the induction of interstitial collagenase and that this is specific for MMP-13, as the induction of IL-1 and IL-6 in response to TNF was not altered by the levels of Mn-SOD. Furthermore, MEFs respond to IL-1α by signaling MMP-13 expression and, in such a setting, require Sod2. Taken together, these findings indicate that Sod2 is important for the IL-1-, TNF-, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-mediated induction of MMP-13. Control at the level of transcription is a major factor determining MMP-1 expression, and a single nucleotide polymorphism (1G/2G) at base pair −1607 that creates an Ets site adjacent to an AP-1 site at base pair −1602 has been shown to dramatically enhance transcription (13Rutter J.L. Mitchell T.I. Buttice G. Meyers J. Gusella J.F. Ozelius L.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5321-5325PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, luciferase promoter constructs containing either the 1G or 2G variation were transiently transfected in control and HT15 cell lines, and the effect on basal transcription was analyzed. The activities of the 1G and 2G promoter constructs in the HT15 cell line were increased ∼20- and 1000-fold, respectively, compared with the control cell line (Fig.4 A). The increase in MMP-1 promoter activity of both constructs by Sod2 overexpression was reversed by coexpression of catalase, indicating an H2O2-dependent regulation. An increase in the 2G frequency in tumor cell lines has been postulated to increase their invasive behavior. In such a setting, the level ofSod2 may well be a determinant of the metastatic potential of tumor cell lines by regulating the expression of MMP-1. Both AP-1 and Ets transcription factors are regulated by MAPK signaling pathways (21Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). The three most well characterized MAPK pathways include the ERK1/2, JNK/SAPK, and p38 pathways. In general, ERK1/2 is activated by mitogens and phorbol esters, whereas JNK/SAPK and p38 are mainly stimulated by environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines. All three pathways have been implicated in the expression of MMPs, and the specific MAPK pathway that regulates MMP expression can vary depending on the inducing agent and cell line. To test which of the MAPK pathways are involved in the induction of MMP-1 by Sod2, control andSod2-overexpressing cells were treated with the specific inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and p38 (SB203580) (Fig.4 B, inset). Northern blotting demonstrated that the ERK1/2 inhibitor blocked basal MMP-1 expression and dramatically decreased MMP-1 mRNA levels in the HT15 cell lines. The p38 inhibitor increased MMP-1 expression in both control and HT15 cell lines. The ERK1/2 inhibitor also blocked the induction of MMP-1 by TNF. The effect of the MAPK inhibitors on MMP-1 expression was also observed with the MMP-1 promoter constructs (Fig.4 B). Furthermore, the inductive properties of SB203580 could be blocked by PD98059. It was thought possible that the ability of PD98059 to inhibit MMP-1 expression may be a property of its ring structure and potential antioxidant properties. To test this hypothesis, an alternative ERK1/2 inhibitor structurally unrelated to PD98059 was tested on MMP-1 promoter activity. The specific ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 blocked the Sod2-dependent increase in both 1G and 2G promoter activities, whereas its non-inhibitory analog (U0124) had no comparable effect (Fig.4 C). The active forms of both ERK1/2 and p38 can be distinguished from their inactive forms by phospho-specific antibodies. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from control and HT15 cells showed an increase in the activated forms of ERK1/2 in theSod2-overexpressing cells that was reversed upon coexpression of catalase (Fig.5 A). The constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in the HT15 cell lines was also blocked by PD98059 (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly, SB203580 activated ERK1/2 in both the control and HT15 cell lines, which may explain its ability to induce MMP-1 expression. The ability of SB203580 (20–50 μm) to activate ERK1/2 has also recently been reported in erythroleukemic cell lines and was not observed when lower concentrations of the drug were used (22Birkenkamp K.U. Tuyt L.M. Lummen C. Wierenga A.T. Kruijer W. Vellenga E. Br. J Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, both low and high doses of SB203580 were capable of activating MMP-1 promoter activity (Fig. 4 D). The above findings indicate that the Sod2-dependent generation of H2O2 leads to the activation of ERK1/2 and are in agreement with studies demonstrating that reactive oxygen species can activate MAPK pathways (23Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The proximal AP-1 element located near position −70 plays a major role in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-1 gene expression and is found near this position in each of the inducible human MMP promoters (21Westermarck J. Kahari V.M. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Because of the conservation of the promoter regions between MMPs, it is possible that other MMPs respond to Sod2 overexpression. In support of this hypothesis, the gelatinolytic activity of MMP-2 and the mRNA levels of MMP-3 and MMP-7 were increased in theSod2 overexpressors compared with control cell lines (Fig.5 C, left panel). The observed decline in MMP-9 activity in the HT15 cell line may represent a negative regulatory aspect of Sod2 in MMP expression. Thus,Sod2 may regulate a broad spectrum of MMPs and function as a “global” redox regulator of metalloproteinases. Under normal physiological conditions, the steady-state concentrations of H2O2 are well within the buffering capacity of the mitochondrial glutathione redox system. However, when Sod2 levels increase, the glutathione-buffering capacity of the mitochondria may be overwhelmed by H2O2. We propose that it is this excess mitochondrial H2O2 that signals the downstream events that lead to the expression of MMP-1 and possibly other MMP family members. The expression of catalase in either the cytosolic or mitochondrial compartment can blockSod2-dependent H2O2production and decrease MMP-1 expression (Fig. 1, A andB). The inability of the endogenous catalase to effectively detoxify the mitochondrially generated H2O2 may be due to its restricted presence in the peroxisomal compartment. An increase in H2O2 production leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by a yet unknown mechanism, as well as the subsequent activation of the MMP-1 promoter. This signaling cascade may be utilized under a variety of conditions in which Sod2levels are elevated. Sod2, IL-1, and MMP-1 expression are elevated in aging systems both in vitro and in vivo. The increased expression of collagenase may result from an elevation in Sod2 levels in response to increasing levels of IL-1 or other inflammatory cytokines. Increases in the levels of H2O2 that result from the enhanced dismutase activity in aged cells may explain the ability of antioxidant strategies to reduce the severity of UV-induced premature skin aging (3Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar) and to extend life span in experimental models of aging (24Melov S. Ravenscroft J. Malik S. Gill M.S. Walker D.W. Clayton P.E. Wallace D.C. Malfroy B. Doctrow S.R. Lithgow G.J. Science. 2000; 289: 1567-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species have also long been implicated in mitogenic signaling and cancer. Recently, the ability of estrogen derivatives to selectively kill human leukemia cells has been attributed to the specific inhibition of SOD activity (25Huang P. Feng L. Oldham E.A. Keating M.J. Plunkett W. Nature. 2000; 407: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Several independent groups have also reported that the elevated levels of Sod2 may correlate with aggressiveness in gastric and colorectal adenocarcinomas and are reflective of a poor overall survival of these patients (26Toh Y.

Lamers C.B. van Krieken J.H. van de Velde C.J. Verspaget H.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 3183-3192PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that Sod2 overexpression can dramatically enhance MMP-1 promoter activity may explain the above observations, as excessive MMP-1 production is a major contributor to the stromal degradation involved in tumor invasion. H2O2 has been implicated as one of the critical signaling molecules leading to the expression of MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts (29Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). H2O2 activates AP-1, an essential transcription factor required for the induction of MMP-1 (17Kheradmand F.

Agents that decrease the H2O2-detoxifying capacity of the cell such as buthionine sulfoximine (a glutathione synthesis inhibitor) and aminotriazole (a catalase inhibitor) enhance basal MMP-1 production (7Wenk J.

The retinoic acid analog tretinoin, which effectively blocks the increase in expression of MMPs following low-dose UV irradiation (3Fisher G.J. Wang Z.Q. Datta S.C. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1171) Google Scholar), also blocks AP-1 activation (31Fisher G.J. Datta S.C. Talwar H.S. Wang Z.Q. Varani J. Kang S. Voorhees J.J.

The ability of tretinoin to antagonize the process of photoinduced skin aging has been attributed to its antioxidant properties. Recent studies in cultured renal mesangial cells demonstrated that tretinoin protects from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity by increasing both cellular reduced glutathione and catalase levels (32Manzano V.M. Puyol M.R. Puyol D.R. Cazana F.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1497165801,"To identify genes involved in breast cancer, polymerase chain reaction-selected cDNA subtraction was utilized to construct a breast cancer-subtracted library. Differential screening of the library isolated the growth factor-inducible immediate-early geneCyr61, a secreted, cysteine-rich, heparin binding protein that promotes endothelial cell adhesion, migration, and neovascularization. Northern analysis revealed that Cyr61was expressed highly in the invasive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, and MDA-MB-157; very low levels were found in the less tumorigenic MCF-7 and BT-20 breast cancer cells and barely detectable amounts were expressed in the normal breast cells, MCF-12A. Univariate analysis showed a significant or borderline significant association between Cyr61 expression and stage, tumor size, lymph node positivity, age, and estrogen receptor levels. Interestingly, expression of Cyr61 mRNA increased 8- to 12-fold in MCF-12A and 3- to 5-fold in MCF-7 cells after 24- and 48-h exposure to estrogen, respectively. Induction of Cyr61mRNA was blocked by tamoxifen and ICI182,780, inhibitors of the estrogen receptor. Stable expression of Cyr61 cDNA under the regulation of a constitutive promoter in MCF-7 cells enhanced anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and significantly increased tumorigenicity and vascularization of these tumors in nude mice. Moreover, overexpression of Cyr61 in MCF-12A normal breast cells induced their tumor formation and vascularization in nude mice. In summary, these results suggest that Cyr61 may play a role in the progression of breast cancer and may be involved in estrogen-mediated tumor development.

Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the United States. The nature of the cellular and molecular changes that lead to breast cancer remains poorly defined. Several of the aberrant tumor suppressor genes that have been identified, include BRCA1,BRCA2 (1Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D. Futreal A.P. Harshman K. Tavtigian S. Liu Q. Cochran C.

Suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH)1 and differential screening (9Diatchenko L. Lau Y.C. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Sieber P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cyr61 was one of the genes isolated from the screening of the subtracted cDNA library. This gene codes for a growth factor-inducible, immediate-early gene first identified in murine fibroblasts (10Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Cyr61 is a secreted, cysteine-rich, heparin-binding protein that associates with the extracellular matrix. Purified Cyr61 protein has been reported to mediate cell adhesion, stimulate chemotaxis, augment growth factor-induced DNA synthesis, enhance cell survival, and induce angiogenesis in vivo (10Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 11Lau L.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because these characteristics may foster the progression of breast cancer, we studied this gene in detail and found it to be highly expressed in some invasive breast cancer cell lines and 36% of primary breast tumors. Furthermore, characterization of the oncogenic activity of Cyr61demonstrated that forced expression of Cyr61 enhanced MCF-7 cell growth in soft agar and promoted tumor growth in both normal breast and breast cancer cells in nude mice.MATERIALS AND METHODSSSH and Differential ScreeningSSH was performed by using the PCR-Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH). Tester double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231; and driver cDNA was made from 2 μg of RNA from the normal breast cell line, MCF-12A. The subtracted library was differentially screened with 32P-labeled probes synthesized as first-strand cDNA from tester and driver. The differential clones were picked and confirmed by Northern analysis.Cell CultureThe cell lines MCF-12A, MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-436, BT-474, BT-20, ZR-75–1, and T47D were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). MCF-12A and MCF-10A normal breast lines were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.01 mg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone, and 5% horse serum; MCF-7 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.); MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-157, BT-474, BT-20, and T47D were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gemini Bio-Products, Calabasas, CA), 10 units/ml penicillin-G, 10 mg/ml streptomycin (Gemini Bio-Products). All cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In experiments in which the effects of estrogen were studied, MCF-12A and MCF-7 cells were first cultured in phenol red free medium with charcoal-treated newborn calf serum. Cells were then treated with estradiol (1 × 10−9 m; Sigma Chemical Co.) for different durations. In the experiments in which antiestrogens were examined, cells were pretreated with tamoxifen for 6 h (1 × 10−7 m; Sigma) or ICI182,780 (1.5 × 10−7 m; Tocris Cooksson Inc., Ballwin, MO) before estradiol treatment.Proteins and AntibodiesRecombinant human Cyr61 protein was purified from anEscherichia coli host strain (BL21) programmed for synthesis of the Cyr61 protein via pGEX-5X-2 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Anti-Cyr61 antibodies were prepared from polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against a GST-Cyr61 fusion protein. Monoclonal antibodies to CD31 were obtained from DADO Corp. (Carpinteria, CA).RNA Preparation and Northern AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from cell lines and patient tissue by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the standard protocol. Cyr61 cDNA probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP by using a random primer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Total cellular RNA was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and was immobilized on a Hybond-N+ membrane by standard capillary transfer and UV cross-linking. The membrane was hybridized with the Cyr61 probe by standard protocol and was rehybridized with a 32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA to confirm equal loading of the samples.Cell Transfection and Soft Agar AssaysThe expression vector pcDNA61 was constructed by placing full-length human Cyr61 cDNA into the pcDNA3.1 eukaryotic expression vector containing the neomycin gene under the control of the same promoter (Invitrogen). The constructs were transfected into MCF-12A and MCF-7 cells by using LipofectAMINE, and transfectants were selected for G418 resistance (400 and 450 μg/ml, respectively). The selected clones were confirmed by Northern analysis. For clonogenic assay, cells were plated into 24-well flat-bottomed plates using a two-layer soft agar system with a total of 1 × 103 cells/well in a volume of 400 μl/well, as described previously (13Munker R. Norman A. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After 14 days of incubation, the colonies were counted and measured. All experiments were done at least three times using triplicate plates per experimental point.Cell Migration AssaysCell migration assays were performed according to the protocol from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). 5 × 104 cells were added to the top of each modified Boyden chamber (10-μm thickness and 8-μm pores) containing polycarbonate membranes (6.5-mm diameter) coated on the underside of the membrane with 10 μg/ml vitronectin and with the lower chamber containing 500 μl of migration buffer (medium with 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Cells were allowed to migrate to the underside of the top chamber for 4–8 h. The migratory cells attached to the bottom surface of the membrane were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 0.1 m borate, pH 9.0, and 2% ethanol for 20 min at room temperature. The stained cells were extracted by using extraction buffer (Chemicon). The number of migratory cells per membrane was determined by absorbance at 550 nm.Tumorigenicity AssayStably transfected MCF-12A/61 and MCF-12A/V cells (1.0 × 106 cells/flank) and MCF-7/61 and MCF-7/V cells (5 × 104 cell/flank) were injected subcutaneously into 8-week-old female nude mice. Each animal was injected at two sites in the flanks. The resulting tumors were measured once a week, and tumor volume (mm3) was calculated by using the standard formula: length × width × height × 0.5236. Tumors were harvested 6 weeks after injection and individually weighed before fixation. Data were presented as both tumor volume (mean ± S.D.) and tumor weight (mean ± S.D.). Statistical analysis was performed with software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) using the Student'st test.Real-time Quantitative PCRQuantitative PCR analysis was performed using the TaqMan PCR Core Reagent kit (PE Biosystems). cDNA of breast cancer samples were diluted, and real-time PCR was performed following the protocol. Her2/neu-specific primers were 5′-ACAGTGGCATCTGTGAGCTG and 5′-CCCACGTCCGTAGAAAGGTA. The TaqMan probe for Her2/neu was 5′-CCAGCCCTGGTCACCTACAACACAG. β-Actin was used for normalization, and β-actin-specific primers were 5′-GATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGC and 5′-ACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCAC. The TaqMan probe for β-actin was 5′-CTCGCTGTCCACCTTCCAGCAGAT.Statistical AnalysisUnivariateChi square methods were used to compare stage, tumor size category, and node status category in Cyr61-positiveversus Cyr61-negative individuals. Age, ER levels, and PgR levels were compared using t tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The kappa statistic was used to assess concordance among stage, tumor size category, and node status and is reported with its standard error.MultivariateThe simultaneous relationship between the six predictors and Cyr61 was modeled using classification tree methods. Comparison of stage versus tumor size showed that these two variables are proxies for each other (kappa = 0.94 ± 0.05, observed agreement = 42/44 = 95%). Therefore, tumor size was not included as a candidate in the multivariate analysis. The concordance between stage and lymph node status was only moderate (kappa = 0.54 ± 0.12). A logistic regression analysis was also carried out but gave poor results and is therefore not reported.RESULTSCyr61 Is Highly Expressed in Some Breast Cancer Cell Lines and Primary Breast TumorsUsing a differential screening technique (see “Materials and Methods”), we identified 36 genes highly expressed in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as compared with normal breast cell line MCF-12A (data not shown). The genes each displayed 6-fold or greater expression in MDA-MB-231 than in MCF-12A, as determined using Northern blots and densitometric analysis (Fig.1). Cyr61, a growth factor-inducible immediate-early gene, is one of these differentially expressed genes. Cyr61 expression was examined in a panel of normal breast and breast cancer cell lines. Northern analysis showed that Cyr61 mRNA was prominently expressed in the highly invasive and tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-157, BT-474, and T47D; it was expressed at a low level in the less tumorigenic tumor cell lines MCF-7, BT-20, and ZR-57–1 and was barely detectable in the normal breast cell lines, MCF-10A and MCF-12A (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Expression of Cyr61 in human breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer samples.Cellular RNA was extracted, subjected to electrophoresis (10 μg of total RNA/lane for cell lines and 5 μg of total RNA/lane for primary tissue), Northern blotted, and probed with 32P-labled Cyr61 cDNA. A, MCF-10A and MCF-12A are normal breast cell lines; LNCaP is a prostate cancer cell line; the others are breast cancer cell lines. B,N1 and N15 are normal breast tissue; all other samples are from primary breast tumors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine the pattern of Cyr61 expression in primary breast tumors, RNAs were isolated from quick-frozen breast samples obtained at initial surgery from 44 individuals with breast cancer (Table I). Each breast carcinoma and matching normal breast tissue was confirmed histologically. Expression of Cyr61 was easily detectable in sixteen of 44 (36%) primary breast cancer samples (Table I), but levels were negligible in normal breast tissues as shown by Northern analysis (Fig.2 B, representative autoradiogram of Northern blot).Table IClinic information of the breast cancer samplesCase no.AgeStageT 1-aT, tumor size.N 1-bN, lymph node status.ERPgRHer2/neu 1-cHer2/neu expression was quantitatively measured by real-time PCR.

Her2/neu was highly expressed in 7 of 16 (44%) Cyr61-positive samples compared with 6 of 28 (21%) Cyr61-negative samples, suggesting Cyr61expression is positively correlated with Her2/neuexpression (Table I).Univariate analysis (Tables II and III) showed either significant or borderline significant association between breast cancer stage, tumor size, lymph node status, ER levels in the primary tumor as well as age at onset of disease compared with whether the primary tumor expressed Cyr61 on Northern blot. For analysis of stage, only 6 of 28 (21%) of women having stages I and II were positive for Cyr61; in contrast, 10 of 16 (63%) of women having stages IIIA, IIIB, or IV expressed Cyr61 (p < 0.006). Similarly, only 6 of 28 (21%) individuals with primary breast cancer size of either 1A (≤2 cm in diameter) or 2A (≤5 cm) had tumors that were Cyr61-positive; in comparison, 10 of 16 (63%) of individuals with a stage of either 3A or 4B (≥5 cm) breast cancer had primary tumors that expressed Cyr61 (p = 0.006). Furthermore, of the 17 patients who were lymph node-negative, only two were Cyr61-positive (12%) compared with 14 Cyr61-positive tumors among the 27 individuals who were lymph node-positive (52%, p = 0.01). The median and mean ages of patients who were Cyr61-negative, were 52 and 53 (±10 S.D.), respectively, compared with a median and mean age of 66 and 64 (±11.7 S.D.) in those who were Cyr61-positive (p = 0.003). Tumors that were Cyr61-negative had a mean ER score of 40 fmol/g (±69 S.D.), whereas those that were Cyr61-positive had a mean ER score of 102 fmol/g (±110 S.D.) (p = 0.03). No statistical difference in the mean progesterone (PgR) values was noted in those that were Cyr61-negative (mean 94.56 fmol/g) versus those that were Cyr61-positive (mean 129.5 fmol/g) (p = 0.55).Table IIUnivariate associations with Cyr61-positive breast cancer discrete variablesn + 2-aNumber of breast cancer sample.Cyr61-positive (%)p valueStage 2-bStage or tumor size; tumor stage and size of primary breast cancer.I/II286 (21%)III/IV1610 (63%)0.006Tumor size 2-bStage or tumor size; tumor stage and size of primary breast cancer.1a/2a286 (21%)3a/4b1610 (63%)0.006Lymph node 2-cLymph node: axillary lymph node involvement.Negative172 (12%)Positive2714 (52%)0.0102-a Number of breast cancer sample.2-b Stage or tumor size; tumor stage and size of primary breast cancer.2-c Lymph node: axillary lymph node involvement.

Open table in a new tab Our classification tree multivariate model predicted that, if the patient at initial diagnosis was less than 57 years of age and had a breast cancer with an ER of less than 24 fmol/g, Cyr61 would be negative (%Cyr61-positive, 0/17 = 0%). If the individual was less than 57 years old and had an ER greater than 24 fmol/g, the model predicted that Cyr61 would be positive (%Cyr61-positive, 4/4 = 100%). If age was greater than 57 and the stage was I or II, the model predicted that Cyr61 would be negative (3/10 = 30% Cyr61-positive); if the age of the patient was greater than 57 and had either stage IIIA or IIIB, Cyr61 was predicted to be positive (9/9 (100%) were Cyr61-positive). This model has an observed sensitivity of 81% and observed specificity of 86% and gave an overall observed correct classification of 84% correctly classified. According to the tree model, when predicting who is Cyr61-positive, ER is only important in younger women under the age of 58, whereas stage is only important in older women over the age of 57. In summary, the model posits that the proportion who have Cyr61-positive breast cancer increases with age, stage, and ER level.Expression of Cyr61 Is Modulated through the Estrogen Receptor Pathway in MCF-12A and MCF-7 CellsPrevious studies have shown that Cyr61 is inducible in the uterus by estrogen treatment in ovariectomized rats (14Rivera-Gonzalez R. Petersen D.N. Tkalcevic G. Thompson D.D. Brown T.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 64: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the correlation ofCyr61 expression in ER+ breast cancers observed in our experiments suggested a potential interaction between the estrogen receptor pathway and expression of Cyr61. To determine whether expression of Cyr61 was regulated by estrogen and estrogen blockade, the estrogen-responsive normal breast cells, MCF-12A, and breast cancer cells, MCF-7, were harvested at different times after estrogen and antiestrogen treatment. Expression of Cyr61 mRNA was induced at 16 h after estradiol (10−9 m) treatment and reached maximum (8- to 12-fold) levels at 48 h and started to decrease slightly after 72 h in the MCF-12A cells (Fig.3 A). Induction of expression of Cyr61 mRNA was inhibited when either tamoxifen or ICI182,780 (estrogen receptor antagonists, 10−7 m) were added to these cultures. A parallel induction (3- to 5-fold) of Cyr61 mRNA occurred in MCF-7 cells after estrogen treatment (10−9 m), which was detectable at 8 h, reached a plateau at 24 h, and decreased at 72 h. The induction was completely blocked by either tamoxifen or ICI182,780 (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3Modulation of Cyr61expression in MCF-12A and MCF-7 cells by estrogen and an estrogen receptor antagonist. Normal breast cell line MCF-12A and breast cancer cell line MCF-7 were treated with β-estradiol (1 × 10−9 m) for different durations; cellular RNA was extracted, subjected to electrophoresis (10 μg of total RNA/lane), Northern blotted, and probed with 32P-labledCyr61 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs. Maximum induction of Cyr61 mRNA expression was observed at 48 h for MCF-12A (A) and 24 h for MCF-7 (B). Induction of Cyr61 expression was blocked by pretreatment of the cells with the estrogen receptor antagonists, tamoxifen (1.0 × 10−7 m) or ICI182,780 (1.5 × 10−7 m).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cyr61 Promotes Cell Proliferation in Soft Agar and Stimulates Cell Migration of Breast Cell LinesPrevious studies indicated that Cyr61 promoted DNA synthesis and cell proliferation of mesenchymal cells from the limb (15Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and stimulated cell migration in fibroblasts (12Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P.

To study if similar activities occurred in breast cells, both normal breast cells (MCF-12A) and breast tumor cells (MCF-7) were stably transfected with pcDNA61 containing either full-length cDNA of Cyr61 (MCF-12A/61 and MCF-7/61) or empty vector pcDNA3.1 (MCF-12A/V and MCF-7/V) as control. As expected,Cyr61 was highly expressed in the MCF-12A/61 and MCF-7/61 but not in the MCF-12/V and MCF-7/V transfected cells as shown by Northern studies (data not shown) and Western analysis (Fig.4 A). The MCF-7/61 cells expressing the Cyr61 vector formed significantly more colonies in soft agar (mean, 2.2- ± 0.6-fold more colonies;p < 0.05) than MCF-7/V cells harboring the empty vector or MCF-7 control cells (Fig. 4 B). The MCF-7/61 colonies also were substantially larger than the MCF-7/V and MCF-7 colonies (data not shown). The results indicated that forced expression of Cyr61 promoted anchorage-independent clonogenic growth of MCF-7 cells. Neither MCF-12A/V nor MCF-12A/61 formed colonies after 4 weeks.Figure 4Formation of colonies in soft agar by MCF-7, MCF/V, and MCF-7/61 cells. Expression of Cyr61 protein by stably transfected MCF-7 (MCF-7/61) cells as shown by Western analysis. Equal loading was shown by the internal nonspecific bands at 90 kDa (A). The MCF/V and MCF-7/61 cell lines were stably transfected with either the empty pcDNA3.1 vector or theCyr61 expression vector, respectively. The MCF-7/61 clone was selected for high expression of Cyr61. B, cells (1.0 × 103/well) were seeded in soft agar for 2 weeks, and colonies were enumerated. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments. C, MCF-7/V and MCF-7/61 cells (1.0 × 103/well) were seeded in soft agar with either estradiol (E2, 10−9 m) or E2 (10−9 m) and tamoxifen (TAM, 10−7 m) for 2 weeks, and colonies were counted. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and the results represent the mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To assess the effects of estrogen and tamoxifen on anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 cells, clonogenic proliferation of MCF-7/V and MCF-7/61 in soft agar containing either estradiol (10−9 m) or estradiol and tamoxifen (10−7 m) was evaluated. Estrogen treatment significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced colony formation of both MCF-7/V and MCF-7/61 cells, and tamoxifen blocked the estrogen-stimulated colony formation in both of these cell types (Fig.4 C).To determine whether enhanced expression of Cyr61 influenced cell migration of MCF-12A and MCF-7 cells, migration assays of MCF-12A/V, MCF-12A/61, MCF-7/V, and MCF-7/61 were performed in vitronectin-coated Boyden chambers. As shown in Fig.5, both MCF-12A/61 and MCF-7/61 cells (Cyr61 stably transfected cell lines) had significantly (p < 0.05) increased migration compared with the empty-vector-transfected MCF-12A/V and MCF-7/V cells in vitronectin-coated Boyden chambers.Figure 5Cyr61 stimulates cell migration in MCF-12A and MCF-7 cells. Cells (5 × 104) were placed into either bovine serum albumin-coated (control) or vitronectin-coated Boyden chambers. Cells were allowed to migrate for 4–8 h and quantified as described in QCM-VN (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). The number of cells that migrated through the membrane was determined by absorbance at 550 nm.

These cells were injected subcutaneously into 8-week-old nude mice, and tumor growth was measured once a week. Tumors from the normal breast cells expressing Cyr61 (MCF-12A/61) first became apparent 3 weeks after injection, and all of the mice developed tumors ranging from 0.6 to 1.4 g at 6 weeks after injection (Figs.6 A, 6B, and 7A).

Of particular interest is the contribution of a glycosylation at Asn297 of the CH2 domain of IgG to receptor recognition. The carbohydrate moieties are found outside the receptor·Fc interface in all receptor·Fc complex structures. To understand the role of glycosylation in FcR recognition, the receptor affinities of a deglycosylated IgG1 and its Fc fragment were determined by solution binding studies using surface plasmon resonance. The removal of carbohydrates resulted in a non-detectable receptor binding to the Fc alone and a 15- to 20-fold reduction of the receptor binding to IgG1, suggesting that the carbohydrates are important in the function of the FcγRIII. Structurally, the carbohydrates attached to Asn297 fill the cavity between the CH2 domains of Fc functioning equivalently as a hydrophobic core. This may stabilize a favorable lower hinge conformation for the receptor binding. The structure of the complex also revealed the dominance of the lower hinge region in receptor·Fc recognition. To evaluate the potential of designing small molecular ligands to inhibit the receptor function, four lower hinge peptides were investigated for their ability to bind to the receptor FcγRIII. These peptides bind specifically to FcγRIII with affinities 20- to 100-fold lower than IgG1 and are able to compete with Fc in receptor binding.

The recent determination of crystal structures of Fcγ and Fcε receptors in complexes with Fc fragments have revealed that these receptors bind asymmetrically at a 1:1 ratio to the lower hinge region of their dimeric Fc ligands (3Garman S.C.

This mode of binding is conserved in both FcγRIII and FcεRI.1 However, a number of questions still remain to be addressed. The first is the role of carbohydrate in the receptor·Fc recognition. In particular, the contribution of a conserved glycosylation site, Asn297 of the constant region of IgG1, remains controversial (6Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Lund J. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Sarmay G. Arata Y. Jefferis R. Mol.

Vallina V.L. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate attached to this glycosylation site is partially ordered in all known structures of Fc (10Deisenhofer J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2361-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1338) Google Scholar), intact antibody (11Harris L.J. Larson S.B. Hasel K.W. Day J. Greenwood A. McPherson A. Nature. 1992; 360: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and in the receptor·Fc complexes, suggesting that a stable rather than a flexible conformation exists for the carbohydrate. Furthermore, unlike most glycosylations that attach to surfaces of the molecules, the carbohydrate attached to Fc is located in a cleft between the two CH2 domains to partially fulfill the cleft. This unique location of carbohydrate may contribute to the conformational stability of Fc, specifically, the relative orientation between the two chains of Fc. Because the receptor epitope is formed primarily by the joint hinge segments of both chains of Fc, receptor recognition is potentially sensitive to the relative orientation of the two CH2 domains. Thus, it is conceivable that the unique position of the glycosylation at Asn297 may contribute to the receptor binding by stabilizing the lower hinge conformation. Although earlier investigations of Fcγ receptor binding to IgG demonstrated a drastic reduction on cell surface receptor affinity when the carbohydrates at Asn297 were removed, similar studies on IgE binding to Fcε receptor revealed a much weaker influence of carbohydrate on receptor-ligand recognition (6Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 7Lund J. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Sarmay G. Arata Y. Jefferis R. Mol.

There are no direct contacts observed between the receptor and the carbohydrate attached to Asn297 in the crystal structures of the receptor·Fc complexes to account for the observed effect of carbohydrate on the Fcγ receptor binding. Certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, result from the activation of Fcγ receptors by auto-antibodies (12Vaughan J.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Tighe H. Carson D.A. Kelley W.N. Harris E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1997: 241-249Google Scholar). The ability to inhibit the receptor activation in this case should help to control the antibody-mediated auto-inflammatory response. The structures of the receptor·Fc complexes revealed the dominance of the lower hinge residues of Fc in the receptor binding, suggesting a new way of designing small peptide ligands that can inhibit the binding of immunoglobulins to their receptors. These receptor inhibitors may be potential candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. In addition, the properties that determine the immunoglobulin isotype specificities of the low affinity Fcγ receptors remains to be identified. The isotype specificities of this receptor have been correlated to the pathogenicity of an anti-erythrocyte auto-antibody (14Fossati-Jimack L. Ioan-Facsinay A. Reininger L. Chicheportiche Y. Watanabe N. Saito T. Hofhuis F.M. Gessner J.E. Schiller C. Schmidt R.E. Honjo T. Verbeek J.S. Izui S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1293-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Earlier results of chimeric IgG work as well as mutational analysis suggest that the lower hinge region is important in determining the receptor preferences (15Chappel M.S. Isenman D.E. Everett M.

Immunol. 1997; 16: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this work, we demonstrate, using solution binding studies that the carbohydrates attached to Asn297 of IgG1 are critical for Fcγ receptor recognition. Synthetic peptides, 8 to 12 residues long and that mimic the lower hinge regions of IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, and IgE, were also shown to bind FcγRIII and to compete with the binding of the native Fc. The Fc fragment of a human monoclonal IgG1 was isolated by papain digestion (17Rousseaux J. Rousseaux-Prevost R. Bazin H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 64: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In brief, IgG1 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 6.6% (w/w) papain at pH 7.1 in the presence of 1 mm cysteamine. This lead to complete cleavage of IgG1. The Fc fragment was separated from the Fab fragments on a Protein A affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with MAPS II (Bio-Rad) binding and elution buffers at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The Fc fragment was further purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0 as a running buffer at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. Deglycosylated Fc fragments and IgG1 were prepared by peptide-N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs) digestion in water for 1.5 h at 37 °C using 1 unit of enzyme/10 μg of protein. The extent of deglycosylation was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gel filtration chromatography, and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The gel filtration experiments were carried out using a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and anÄkta high pressure liquid chromatography purifier (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris at pH 8.0 as running buffer at a 0.1 ml/min flow rate. ESI-MS measurements were acquired and recorded with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Sciex API-300 triple quadruple system (Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) using 8 μg of native or deglycosylated Fc fragment and 6 μg of native or deglycosylated IgG1. The native and deglycosylated IgG1 were reduced with 100 mm dithiothreitol prior mass spectrometry measurements. Peptides of 8 to 12 amino acids in length with the sequences of the lower hinge receptor binding region of IgG1, IgG2, IgG4, and IgE were synthesized (TableI). All peptides were purified on a Superdex 200 HR16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with H2O as the running buffer to remove impurities and to exchange the original buffer. A mostly polyalanine peptide (pALA) with a sequence of AAADAAAAL was used as the control. The concentrations of peptides were estimated using absorbance at 220 nm and an extinction coefficient of 2.6 absorbance units per ml mg−1. All peptides were confirmed by mass using ESI-MS. Peptide pIgG1 includes a lower hinge cysteine residue that forms the conserved disulfide bond between the immunoglobulin heavy chains. The disulfide-bonded dimeric form of the peptide was generated by incubating the peptide under a mild base condition of pH 8.0 for 1 h at room temperature. This disulfide-bonded form, resistant to alkylation by iodoacetamide (data not shown), was designated as cIgG1. The free cysteine in the monomeric pIgG1 was blocked by alkylation with iodoacetamide to prevent the dimerization.Table IImmobilization of the lower hinge peptides and FcγRIIISample namePeptide lengthPeptide sequenceImmobilizationConcentrationResponseRU 1-aRU, resonance units.pIgG112-merCPAPELLGGPSV10 mm295cIgG112-merCPAPELLGGPSV10 mm586pIgG28-merPPVAGPSV10 mm362pIgG49-merPEFLGGPSV10 mm313pIgE9-merDSNPRGVSA10 mm473pALA9-merAAADAAAAL10 mm449FcγRIIIFlow cell 215 μm10,182Flow cell 345 μm11,7311-a RU, resonance units. Open table in a new tab Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed using BIAcore 2000 instrument (BIAcore AB). FcγRIII receptor was immobilized at concentrations of 15 and 45 μm in 10 mmsodium acetate, pH 6.0, on a CM5 sensor chip usingN-hydrosuccinimide/1-ethyl-3(-3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (NHS/EDC) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min (Table I). Flow cell 4 of every sensor chip was mocked with NHS/EDC as a negative control of binding. All peptides were immobilized at 10 mmconcentration on CM5 sensor chips in 100 mm EDTA at pH 8.0 with NHS/EDC at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. The binding buffer consisted of 20 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20, 10 mm HEPES at pH 7.4 mixed with various concentrations of analyte. Binding of the native and deglycosylated Fc fragments to the immobilized FcγRIII was measured using serial dilutions of the analyte from 10 to 0.078 μm at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The binding of IgG1 and its deglycosylated form to the immobilized receptor was measured with the analyte concentrations varying from 10 to 0.02 μm. For the binding of the receptor to immobilized peptides, the analyte consisted of a serial dilution of the receptor between 750 and 0.37 μm. The same immobilized peptide chips were used for competition experiments in which the analyte consisted of 10 μm FcγRIII mixed with various concentrations of Fc from 10 to 0.02 μm. To measure the binding between protein G and Fc, protein G was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at 50 μm concentration. The native or the deglycosylated Fc at concentrations between 5 and 0.15 μm were used. All dissociation constants (KD) were obtained either from a linear regression of steady state 1/Response versus 1/C plots using ORIGIN 3.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc.) or from kinetic rate constants fitted with the BIAevaluation software package (BIAcore AB). Papain digestion of the human IgG1 resulted in a 53-kDa disulfide-bonded Fc fragment. Due to the carbohydrate attachment to Asn297, the mass spectrum of the native Fc fragment displays considerable heterogeneity in mass (Fig.1A). Treatment of the native Fc fragment with peptide-N-glycosidase F under non-denaturing condition resulted in a shift of molecular mass of the Fc from 53,400 to 50,345 Da (Fig. 1B). This agrees well with the predicted 50,407-Da molecular mass of the polypeptide backbone of Fc, indicating a complete enzymatic removal of carbohydrates. The deglycosylated Fc has an apparent molecular weight similar to that of the native Fc in a Superdex 200 SMART gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig. 1C). It remains as a disulfide bonded dimer (Fig. 1D). The result of a native gel electrophoresis shows that the deglycosylated Fc fragment appears to be more compact than the native Fc (Fig. 1E). Both deglycosylated IgG1 and its Fc fragment were prepared under similar conditions (under “Experimental Procedures”) and purified by Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion chromatography. Solution binding experiments were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument with the receptor immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. The analyte consisted of serial dilutions of IgG1 or Fc with concentrations from 10 to 0.02 μm and 10 to 0.08 μm, respectively. The affinity of FcγRIII for the native Fc fragment was essentially the same as that for IgG1, ∼5 μm (TableII). Deglycosylation of the Fc fragment resulted in no detectable receptor binding (Fig.2A), and that of IgG1 resulted in a KD of ∼50 μm, a 10-fold reduction in the receptor binding affinity (Table II, Fig.2B).Table IIDissociation constants for the binding of FcγRIIIImmobilizationAnalyteKDμmBinding between the receptor and Fc2-aFcγRIII were immobilized to a CM5 sensor chip in flow cell 2 and 3 via primary amine attachment at approximate concentrations of 15 and 45 μm, respectively.

Open table in a new tab To rule out the possibility that the loss of receptor binding was due to a global disruption of the Fc structural fold induced by deglycosylation, binding of both the native and deglycosylated Fc to protein G, which recognizes the CH2-CH3 junction region of Fc, were also measured on a immobilized protein G sensor chip. The protein G binding dissociation constant is 47 nm for the native Fc and 130 nm for the deglycosylated Fc. The ability of deglycosylated Fc to bind protein G suggests no global disruption in the structure upon removal of the carbohydrate. This is also evident from the gel filtration and native gel electrophoresis analyses, both of which show a slightly more compact shape of the deglycosylated Fc compared with that of the native Fc (Fig. 1, C and E). The crystal structure of FcγRIII in complex with Fc illustrates that the receptor primarily recognizes the lower hinge region of the Fc with 60% of the interface area contributed by the four lower hinge residues, Leu-Leu-Gly-Gly (234). To test whether the lower hinge alone can be recognized by the receptor, peptides with the corresponding lower hinge sequences of IgG1/3, IgG2, IgG4, and IgE were synthesized (Table I). All four peptides were able to bind to the immobilized receptor on a CM5 sensor chip (Fig.3), although pIgG1 binds consistently better than other peptides at all concentrations tested. Due to the low receptor immobilization and the weak binding affinity, the dissociation constant of the receptor-peptide binding could not be derived from these experiments. To estimate the affinity between the peptides and FcγRIII, individual peptides were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips at 10 mm concentration, and SPR measurements were recorded (Table I). Serial dilutions of the receptor between 750 and 0.37 μm concentrations were used as the analyte (Fig. 4). Among the peptides, the disulfide-linked cIgG1 binds the tightest, with aKD of 113 μm. This is about 20 times less than the affinity of the native Fc and two time less than that of the deglycosylated IgG1. Among the other peptides, pIgG1, pIgG2, and pIgG4 display similar receptor binding affinity (Table II and Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, pIgE displays significant binding to FcγRIII compared with pALA, although the affinity is 4–10 times lower than other hinge peptides. To further investigate whether the peptides share the same receptor binding site as Fc, direct binding competition experiments were performed for the peptides using the native Fc fragment as a competitor. In each experiment, an analyte consisting of 10 μm of FcγRIII mixed with various concentrations of Fc was used to bind to the individual peptides immobilized on CM5 sensor chips. If peptides recognize the same receptor region as that of Fc, the receptor binding to the immobilized peptides will decrease as the concentration of Fc in analyte increases. On the other hand, if the peptides bind to a separate site on the receptor as that of Fc, the SPR response will be independent of or will increase with the Fc concentration due to the higher molecular weight of receptor·Fc complex. The results of competition experiments show that the binding of the receptor to cIgG1, pIgG1, pIgG2, and pIgG4 peptides is blocked by increasing concentrations of Fc (Fig.5). Because no detectable affinities could be observed between the Fc and the peptides (Table II), the effect of competition resulted directly from the titration of the receptor rather than from the masking of the peptides by Fc. The amount of Fc required to completely block the receptor·peptide interaction is about 10 μm, in agreement with the Fc·receptor binding affinity. This suggests the peptides bind to FcγRIII at the same site as that of Fc. Interestingly, the receptor binding of pIgE displays a similar Fc competition curve as other peptides, indicating that pIgE also shares the same Fc binding site. However, the Fc competition of pIgE is less profound compared with those of other peptides due to a lower receptor·peptide affinity. The control peptide, pALA, displays no measurable receptor binding nor Fc competition. The contribution of glycosylation of Fc to the function of immunoglobulins has been debated over the years. Early studies have demonstrated that aglycosylated IgG2a caused a mild reduction in the activation of complement component C1 but a drastic reduction in the activation of Fcγ receptors when compared with the native IgG2a (7Lund J. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Sarmay G. Arata Y. Jefferis R. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18Leatherbarrow R.J. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. Woof J.M. Clark A.

Immunol. 1993; 30: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) found that aglycosylated IgG3 was capable of triggering human phagocyte respiratory burst at 80% of the level triggered by the glycosylated IgG3 despite a severe impairment in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Unlike Fcγ receptors, the removal of carbohydrate of IgE did not cause significant loss in FcεRI recognition (9Kulczycki Jr., A. Vallina V.L. Mol. Immunol. 1981; 18: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Basu M. Hakimi J. Dharm E. Kondas J.A. Tsien W.H. Pilson R.S. Lin P. Gilfillan A. Haring P. Braswell E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13118-13127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, the oligosaccharides attached to Asn297 of IgG are a biantennary type with a core heptasaccharide consisting of threeN-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) and three manose (Man) and variable fucose additions to the core (6Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Unlike most surface-attached glycosylations, these carbohydrates occupy a unique space between the two chains of Fc and appear to have well organized conformations in all crystal structures of Fc with electron densities visible to most of the core sugar moieties. Recently, the crystal structures of IgG1-Fc in complex with FcγRIII and IgE-Fc in complex with FcεRI have been determined (3Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 4Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 5Radaev S.

However, no significant interactions were observed between the carbohydrate on Fc and its receptor in the complex structures. To understand the apparent discrepancy between the known functional importance of this glycosylation and the lack of a structural engagement at the receptor·Fc interface, we have examined the biophysical and binding properties of a deglycosylated IgG1 and its Fc fragment. The Fc fragment binds to FcγRIII at essentially the same affinity as that of an intact IgG1 as measured by BIAcore experiments. Both have a dissociation constant of 4 μm. This agrees well with the previously published ∼1 μm forKD (20Galon J. Robertson M.W. Galinha A. Mazieres N. Spagnoli R. Fridman W.H. Sautes C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1928-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Huizinga T.W. Kerst M. Nuyens J.H. Vlug A. dem Borne A.E. Roos D. Tetteroo P.A. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 2359-2364PubMed Google Scholar). Upon enzymatic deglycosylation, the IgG1-FcγRIII binding dissociation constant increased from 4 to 50 μm, whereas the Fc·FcγRIII binding became non-detectable. This 10- to 15-fold loss in the receptor binding affinity indicates that the carbohydrate contributes significantly to the receptor-ligand recognition. Because the sugar moieties make no direct contact with the receptor at the receptor·Fc interface, the most likely role for the carbohydrate is to stabilize the IgG lower hinge in an active receptor binding conformation. The extent of epitope stability provided by the glycosylation is also evident when the affinity of the deglycosylated IgG1 is compared with that of a disulfide-linked peptide, cIgG1. The affinity of the deglycosylated IgG1 is only two times higher than that of cIgG1, which presumably has no defined epitope conformation in solution. It is conceivable that this conformational stability may result from the interaction between the carbohydrate moieties which clearly visible in the electron density of the FcγRIII·Fc complex structure, and may serve as a substitute hydrophobic core. The removal of the carbohydrates by deglycosylation may cause a conformational change in the relative orientation of the two CH2 domains such that the Fc transitions from an open to a closed conformation (Fig. 6). A structural change associated with aglycosylated IgG3 was previously observed in the vicinity of His268 within the CH2 domain as detected by NMR experiments (7Lund J. Tanaka T. Takahashi N. Sarmay G. Arata Y. Jefferis R. Mol. Immunol. 1990; 27: 1145-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Analysis of native gel electrophoresis is also consistent with the deglycosylated Fc being more compact than the native Fc (Fig. 1E). Alternatively, the carbohydrates may restrict the lower hinge flexibility, and their removal would result in enhanced hinge flexibility and thus reduced receptor binding (22Burton D.R. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 161-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the deglycosylated Fc consistently resulted in a 2-fold reduction in protein G binding affinity. Even though protein G binds at the CH2-CH3 hinge region of Fc, away from the carbohydrate moieties (23Sauer-Eriksson A.E. Kleywegt G.J. Uhlen M. Jones T.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), a mild reduction in the protein G binding affinity was observed upon deglycosylation. This suggests a structural change in the CH2-CH3 hinge angle as the result of deglycosylation. It is also consistent with the hypothesis that the carbohydrate-free Fc adopts a different hinge conformation. Besides the normal function of FcR in triggering cellular inflammatory response to clear antigen-bound immune complexes, FcR also mediates autoimmune diseases generated from the response to autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis (12Vaughan J.H. Arthritis Rheum. 1993; 36: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Tighe H. Carson D.A. Kelley W.N. Harris E.D. Ruddy S. Sledge C.B. Textbook of Rheumatology. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1997: 241-249Google Scholar, 24Ravetch J.V. Clynes R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, it would be beneficial to block the autoantibody-triggered activation of FcR to relieve the auto-inflammatory response that leads to specific tissue damage. Because the activation of FcR requires receptor aggregation by multivalent antigen immune complexes, small molecule compounds that are capable of competing with the binding of immune complexes to FcR should prevent the receptor aggregation and thus inhibit FcR activation (25McDonnell J.M. Beavil A.J. Mackay G.A. Jameson B.A. Korngold R. Gould H.J. Sutton B.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure of FcγRIII in complex with Fc provides a detailed map of the molecular interface between the receptor and Fc (5Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.-H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In particular, the dominance of the lower hinge of Fc, which occupies 60% of the interface area, suggests that peptides resembling the lower hinge conformation could be good candidates to inhibit the receptor function. In an attempt to evaluate such peptide inhibitors and their ability to compete with the receptor binding to the native ligand, we designed four peptides with sequences encompassing the receptor binding region of the lower hinges of IgG1, -2, -4, and IgE. Among these peptides, the disulfide-linked IgG1 hinge peptide, cIgG1, binds the tightest to FcγRIII with an affinity ∼20 times less than the native immunoglobulins and three times better than the non-disulfide-linked peptide, pIgG1 (Table II). The observed difference in receptor binding between cIgG1 and pIgG1 suggests that the disulfide bond located at the lower hinge region of Fc contributes to its conformational stability. The three IgG-derived peptides bind to the receptor with approximately the same affinity. An unexpected result is that the IgE-derived peptide, pIgE, possesses a significant binding affinity to FcγRIII. This is particularly interesting, because the lower hinge sequence of IgE is quite different from those of IgGs. It suggests that the binding of low affinity receptors may be quite promiscuous. It leads to the possibility of FcγRIII activation by antigen-bound IgE under certain circumstances such as in a saturated allergen condition or in the absence of Fcε receptors. In fact, the binding of IgE-immune complexes to the low affinity Fcγ receptors on mast cells has been observed to trigger the release of serotonin (26Takizawa F. Adamczewski M. Kinet J.P. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The competition results show that all lower hinge peptides compete directly with Fc in receptor binding. The ability of these lower hinge peptides to inhibit Fc binding to the receptor opens potential new ways of designing therapeutic compounds. For examples, pIgG analogs may be useful in treating Fcγ receptor-mediated autoimmune diseases by blocking the activation of the receptor, or pIgE-like compounds could be used as potent inhibitors of Fcε receptors thus providing a potential treatment for allergy. This study on the binding affinity of the lower hinge peptides has also allowed us to examine the issue of the receptor isotype specificity. The low affinity human FcγRIII binds to IgG1 and IgG3 much better than it does to IgG2 and IgG4 (16Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Previous mutation studies of IgG2 and its binding to human high affinity receptor FcγRI allow us to conclude that the entire lower hinge sequence was required to restore the IgG1 binding affinity in IgG2, whereas point mutations in IgG1 hinge residues resulted in a loss of the receptor binding (15Chappel M.S. Isenman D.E. Everett M. Xu Y.Y. Dorrington K.J. Klein M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9036-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In this work, the lower hinge peptides instead of the antibodies were used in the study of the receptor binding. This enables us to separate the individual amino acid contribution to the receptor affinity from the effect of their environment, namely the length of lower hinge in an intact antibody. The results from studies of solution binding between the receptor and immobilized peptides and from Fc competition assays show that pIgG2 and pIgG4 have nearly the same affinity to FcγRIII as does pIgG1. Replacing Leu with Phe in pIgG4 or changing Glu-Leu-Leu-Gly to Pro-Val-Ala in pIgG2 in addition to a single residue deletion makes little difference in the affinity toward the receptor. This suggests that factors other than the lower hinge amino acid composition play an important role in determining the weaker binding affinity of IgG2 and IgG4 to FcγRIII (relative to IgG1). It has been proposed that the overall length of the lower hinge may be important to the receptor IgG subtype specificity (16Tamm A. Schmidt R.E. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 16: 57-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), because the hinges of IgG1 and -3 are about three residues longer than those of IgG2 and -4. It is also possible, however, that each IgG subtype varies in its glycosylation at Asn297 and that the differences in carbohydrate may contribute to the observed receptor specificity. Some preference in glycosylation of IgGs is known to exist (6Jefferis R. Lund J. Pound J.D. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Residues outside the lower hinge region but in the vicinity of receptor interface could also influence the receptor binding preference. For example, Pro329 of Fc is sandwiched between Trp90 and Trp113 of the receptor, providing important van der Waals contacts between the receptor and Fc. Although Pro329 is conserved among the IgG subtypes, residue 327 displays a dimorphism with an Ala in IgG1 and -3 and a Gly in IgG2 and -4. In conclusion, the present study suggests that glycosylation at Asn297 of Fc fragments plays an important role in the binding of Fc fragments to the low affinity receptor FcγRIII. The role of carbohydrate appears to be primarily to stabilize the receptor epitope conformation. We also demonstrated that small peptide ligands can be designed to inhibit the binding of FcγRIII to its natural ligand Fc. We thank Drs. C. Sautes-Fridman and W. H.

Five mammalian members of the Rel family have been identified as follows: NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), c-Rel, Rel-A (p65), and RelB. The first two of these are produced as inactive precursor molecules of 105 (p105) and 100 (p100) kDa, respectively (4Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A.

In response to agonist stimulation with ligands such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α and interleukin-1 (IL-1), IκBs are proteolytically degraded, releasing associated NF-κB dimers to translocate into the nucleus and induce gene expression (1Ghosh S.

IκBs consist of a family of structurally related proteins, which includes IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε together with the precursor forms of NF-κB1 (p105) and NF-κB2 (p100) (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). These all contain multiple ankyrin repeats that interact with the nuclear localizing signals of RHDs to prevent nuclear translocation of associated Rel subunits. The best characterized member of the IκB family is IκBα, which binds p50/Rel-A and p50/c-Rel heterodimers (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev.

In response to stimulation with an NF-κB agonist, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated in a conserved D(P)SGψXS(P) motif at its N terminus (8Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X.

The regulatory serines of IκBα are phosphorylated by a 700-kDa complex, the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which contains three polypeptides as follows: the serine kinases IKK1 (IKKα) and IKK2 (IKKβ) and a structural subunit NEMO (IKKγ) (2Karin M. Delhase M. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ form a heterodimer that directly phosphorylates IκBα (12Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is activated by both TNFα and IL-1. NEMO plays an essential role in coupling the IKK complex to upstream signals (13Yamaoka S.

The phosphorylated sequence is recognized by the SCFβTRCPubiquitin ligase complex which then promotes rapid ubiquitination on two adjacent lysine residues and subsequent degradation of IκBα by the 26 S proteasome to release associated NF-κB dimers (14Maniatis T.

The constitutive proteolytic generation of NF-κB1 p50 from its precursor p105 involves ubiquitination and is mediated by the 26 S proteasome (6Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1908) Google Scholar). This is an unusual example of limited proteolysis by the proteasome resulting from the presence of a glycine-rich region in the C-terminal half of the p50 moiety of p105 that appears to act as a physical barrier to proteasome entry (16Lin L. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2248-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Orian A. Schwartz A.L. Israel A. Whiteside S. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, p105 levels may be regulated by two proteolytic pathways, limited (processing to p50) and complete (degradation). An alternative mechanism has also been suggested in which p105 is processed co-translationally by the proteasome to produce p50 (18Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C.

The relative importance of post-translational versus co-translational processing of p105 is presently unclear and may be cell type-specific. Unprocessed p105 functions as an IκB through the association of its C-terminal ankyrin repeats with p50, c-Rel, or Rel-A, which are thereby retained in the cytoplasm (4Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 5Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Following stimulation with TNFα, and other NF-κB agonists, p105 is phosphorylated and then proteolyzed more rapidly by the proteasome (5Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 19Mellits K.H. Hay R.T. Goodbourn S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This predominantly results in accelerated p105 degradation, rather than increased processing to p50 (21Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 22Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Freed Rel subunits can then translocate into the nucleus to activate gene transcription. A physiological role for p105 in the correct regulation of NF-κB has been suggested by the generation of mice lacking its C-terminal (IκB-like) half, while still expressing p50 product (23Ishikawa H. Claudio E. Dambach D. Raventos-Suarez C. Ryan C. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Such mice display a chronic inflammatory phenotype that correlates with increased nuclear NF-κB1 p50 homodimers and involves altered function of T cells, B cells, and macrophages. It has been shown recently that the mammalian IKK complex immunoprecipitated from transfected cells will phosphorylate recombinant p105 in vitro in a region of the C-terminal PEST domain that appears to be important for TNFα-induced degradation in HeLa cells (21Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Overexpressed IKK2 also promotes the proteolysis of co-transfected p105 in COS cells (24Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the IKK complex directly phosphorylates the PEST domain of p105 to promote its proteolysis after TNFα stimulation. However, such in vitro and overexpression experiments are prone to artifact, as exemplified by recent genetic data showing that NIK is not actually required for NF-κB activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines (25Shinkura R. Kitada K. Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) contrary to previous transfection data in cell lines (26Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Indeed, the spacing of the putative IKK target serine residues (underlined) in the p105 PEST domain (920DSDSVCDSGVETS) identified in vitro (21Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) differs considerably from the regulatory phosphorylation sites on IκBα (see above). Thus it is possible that immunoprecipitated IKK complex does not directly phosphorylate p105 in vitro, but this is mediated by an associated downstream kinase. In this study, the role of the IKK complex in controlling p105 proteolysis was investigated genetically using knockout cell lines lacking IKK component subunits. These experiments demonstrated that a functional IKK complex is essential for TNFα and IL-1α to trigger efficiently p105 degradation. Analysis of a panel of point mutants demonstrated that serine 927 in the PEST domain of p105, which is part of a motif related to the IKK phosphorylation site on IκBα, is directly phosphorylated by the IKK complex to regulate its signal-induced degradation. Significantly, this residue does not correspond to any of the three serine residues previously proposed to be important for TNFα-induced degradation of p105 (21Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4766-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A simple explanation for this apparent discrepancy is the incorrect designation of this residue as a threonine when the cDNA for p105 was initially cloned and sequenced (27Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 28Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F.

This was confirmed during the preparation of this manuscript by Heissmeyer et al. (29Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), who also concluded that phosphorylation of serine 927 by the IKK complex regulates signal-induced p105 degradation. p105 constructs were subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) for transient mammalian cell expression experiments and into the pMX-1 expression vector (Ingenius) for generation of stably transfected HeLa cell lines. Addition of an N-terminal HA epitope tag to the cDNA encoding human p105 (28Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F. Le Bail O. Urban M.B. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P.A. Israel A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and generation of p105 point mutants were done using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was also used to generate a cDNA encoding a GST-p105-(758–967) fusion protein and its S927A derivative, subcloned into the pGEX-6P vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For baculovirus expression, IKK1 and IKK2 constructs were tagged at the N terminus with a His6 tag by PCR and subcloned into the pFastBac vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA templates for PCR of IKK1 (clone 1321982) and IKK2 (clone 3126643) were obtained from Incyte Genomics. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. FLAG-IKK2, subcloned in the pCMV vector, has been described previously (30Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.W. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). The following anti-peptide antisera were raised in rabbits to synthetic peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce): human p105 amino acids 952–967 (anti-hp105-C); murine p105 amino acids 955–971 (anti-mp105-C); human IKK1 amino acids 13–28 (anti-IKK1); and human IKK2 amino acids 572–588 (anti-IKK2). To generate the anti-phospho-Ser927 antibody, a peptide was synthesized corresponding to residues 922–935 of human p105 in which serine 927 is phosphorylated. After high pressure liquid chromatography purification, this phosphopeptide was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits. Anti-IκBα antibody was kindly provided by Ron Hay (University of St. Andrews, Scotland, UK) and anti-GST mAb by Steve Dillworth (Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK). 12CA5 mAb was used for immunoprecipitation of HA-p105, whereas a high affinity anti-HA mAb (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for its detection in Western blots. Anti-NEMO (IKKγ) and anti-phospho-Ser32 IκBα antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml) and maintained in a rapid growth phase for experiments. Mouse embyronic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking component subunits of the IKK complex were generously provided by the originating laboratories (see Fig. 1 legend). To stably transfect HeLa cells (Ohio subline from ECACC) with HA-p105, 7 × 105 cells were plated in a 90-mm dish (Life Technologies, Inc.) and, after 18 h in culture, transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were cultured for a further 48 h and then selected for neomycin resistance with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 4 weeks, clones were picked manually and then expanded. Expression of HA-p105 was determined by Western blotting. All pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. For MEFs, 3 × 105 cells were plated per 60-mm dish. After 18 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in methionine/cysteine-free minimal essential Eagle's medium (Sigma) for 1 h. Cells were pulse-labeled with 2.65 MBq of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine (Pro-Mix, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30–45 min and chased for the indicated times in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 2% fetal calf serum) alone (0) or complete medium supplemented with TNFα (20 ng/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or IL-1α (4 ng/ml; R & D Systems). Cells were lysed in buffer A (31Salmeron A. Ahmad T.B. Carlile G.W. Pappin D. Narsimhan R.P. Ley S.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and endogenous p105 immunoprecipitated as described previously (22Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) using a 1:1 mixture of anti-hp105-C and anti-mp105-C (10 μl of antiserum total per immunoprecipitate). NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Pulse-chase metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out as described previously (22Belich M.P. Salmeron A. Johnston L.H. Ley S.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Labeled bands were quantified by laser densitometry (Calibrated Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad). To analyze HA-p105 proteolysis in stably transfected HeLa clones, cells were plated at 6 × 105per well of a 6-well plate (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 18 h of culture, pulse-chase metabolic labeling was carried out as for MEFs. HA-p105 was isolated by immunoprecipitation with 12CA5 anti-HA mAb after lysis with buffer A supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate. To analyze in vivo phosphorylation of p105 on serine 927, 5 × 106 HeLa cells were plated per 100-mm dish. After 18 h in culture, cells were pretreated with 20 μm MG132 proteasome inhibitor for 30 min (Biomol Research Labs) and then stimulated for the indicated times with IL-1α (4 ng/ml), TNFα (20 ng/ml), or control medium. Endogenous p105 was then immunoprecipitated using anti-hp105-C antiserum, following extraction in buffer A, and Western-blotted with anti-phospho-Ser927antiserum. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was used as a blocking agent for blots. For in vitro phosphorylation experiments with endogenous IKK complex, control or TNFα-stimulated HeLa cells (7 × 105) were lysed in Buffer A and immunoprecipitated using anti-NEMO antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in Buffer A and once in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmMgCl2). Immunoprecipitates were then incubated at room temperature in 50 μl of kinase buffer plus 40 μm ATP and 5 μg of purified GST-p105-(758–967) or GST-p105-(758–967)-(S928A) fusion protein. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and proteins Western blotted with anti-phospho-Ser927 antiserum. His6-IKK1 and His6-IKK2 were expressed in Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus infection. Proteins were isolated from 1 liter of cell pellet extracted with 50 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1.0% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Centrifuged lysate was applied to a 5-ml chelating Sepharose HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was pretreated with NiCl2 and equilibrated in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl. The column was then washed with 50 mm imidazole and bound protein eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The protein was buffer exchanged into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mmdithiothreitol using a 5-ml Desalt HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stored at −80 °C. Protein was >90% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels (data not shown). For in vitro kinase assays with baculovirus IKK-1/2, 25 ng of recombinant IKK protein was used per reaction which were carried out as described above. A genetic approach was taken to investigate the role of the IKK complex in p105 degradation induced by physiological stimulation to avoid potential problems associated with the use of dominant negative kinase mutants (see the Introduction). To do this, a series of pulse-chase metabolic labeling experiments were carried out in embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells isolated from the indicated knockout mice to determine p105 turnover after cytokine stimulation. In cells lacking either IKK1 (32Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) or IKK2 (33Li Q. Antwerp D.V. Mercurio F. Lee K.-F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), both TNFα and IL-1α increased the proteolysis of p105 to a similar degree to their wild type counterparts (Fig. 1, Aand B). Control experiments also demonstrated that neither IKK1 nor IKK2 was absolutely essential for TNFα and IL-1α to trigger degradation of IκBα, although the extent of IκBα degradation was markedly decreased in cells lacking IKK2 (Fig. 1,A and B). In contrast, cytokine-induced degradation of p105 was significantly reduced, and IκBα was completely blocked, in MEF cells lacking NEMO expression ((34) Fig.1 C). Control experiments confirmed that both TNFα and IL-1α stimulation of NEMO-negative cells promoted phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, indicating that the TNFα and IL-1 signaling pathways were still intact in these cells (data not shown). Since NEMO is essential for IKK activation by pro-inflammatory cytokines (13Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A.

Cell. 2000; 5: 969-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), these data demonstrated that a functional IKK complex is required for both TNFα and IL-1α to trigger efficiently p105 proteolysis. IKK1 and IKK2, however, are redundant in this signaling pathway. The experiments with IKK knockout cell lines suggested that p105 might be a direct target of IKK. Interestingly, a data base search revealed a conserved motif in p105 that is similar to the IKK complex phosphorylation site in IκBα. Fig. 2 A compares an alignment of residues 918–935 from the PEST domain of human p105 with p105 sequences from other species. This region contains two overlapping sequences related to the IKK target sequence in Iκβα that are identical in the p105 sequences from human, mouse, and rat. In chicken p105, however, only the second of these overlapping motifs are identical, and the first differed at two positions from the human p105 sequence (Fig. 2 A). Interestingly, the regulatory IKK phosphorylation site at the N terminus of IκBα is identical between human, mouse, rat, and chicken sequences (36Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. Lebail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, a discrepancy was noted at residue 927, which is a serine in three of the published human p105 sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers: 227315, AAF35232, and XP003398), and also in the corresponding residue in mouse, rat, and chicken p105. However, in three other published human p105 sequences there is a threonine at residue 927 (GenBankTMaccession numbers: P19838, AAA36361, and AAA94041). To confirm directly the sequence in this region of human p105, clones encoding p105 cDNA were obtained from two different laboratories and sequenced over the DNA region encoding amino acids 918–935. Both sequences predicted a serine at amino acid 927, although one of these had been reported previously to encode a threonine at this position (28Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F. Le Bail O. Urban M.B. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P.A. Israel A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). This difference is accounted for by a single base pair error in the original published DNA sequence. DNA was also extracted from primary human lymphocytes from four donors and sequenced. Again these sequences all predicted a serine at amino acid 927. Together these analyses clearly indicated that residue 927 in human p105 is a serine rather than a threonine. Human, mouse, rat, and chicken p105, therefore, all contain a sequence (DnSGVETn+5) that is closely related to the IκBα regulatory sequence (DnSGLDSn+5) and contains conservative substitutions at residues n + 3 and n + 4 but in which the second serine at n + 5 is replaced with a threonine (Fig. 2, A and B). A series of serine or threonine to alanine mutants were generated in the region of the human p105 PEST domain containing the two potential overlapping IKK target sites (Fig.2 C). Overexpressed IKK2 triggers proteolysis of co-transfected p105 (24Orian A. Gonen H. Bercovich B. Fajerman I. Eytan E. Israel A. Mercurio F. Iwai K. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2580-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, to investigate whether any of the p105 mutations affected IKK2-promoted p105 proteolysis, 3T3 fibroblasts were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged p105 together with IKK2 or empty vector. HA-p105 turnover was then assessed by immunoprecipitating HA-p105 from lysates of pulse-chase metabolically labeled cells and resolving isolated protein by SDS-PAGE. Overexpressed IKK2 dramatically decreased the half-life of pulse-labeled HA-p105 compared with empty vector control (Fig. 3, A andB). The S921A, S923A, and T931A mutants of HA-p105 were all degraded similar to wild type HA-p105 in response to IKK2 co-expression (Fig. 3 B). HA-p105(S932A) was also degraded when co-expressed with IKK2 but consistently with delayed kinetics compared with wild type HA-p105 (Fig. 3 B). However, IKK2 had little detectable effect on the proteolysis of HA-p105(S927A) (Fig. 3,A and B). Thus serine 927 plays a crucial role in controlling the proteolysis of p105 triggered by IKK2 overexpression. It was important to demonstrate that serine 927 is important for proteolysis of p105 induced by physiological stimulation with cytokines, in addition to its essential role in proteolysis triggered by IKK2 overexpression. To this end, HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HA-p105 or HA-p105(S927A) and stable clones isolated after G418 selection. A pulse-chase experiment was carried out with a representative clone expressing levels of HA-p105(S927A) similar to that of a control clone expressing HA-p105 (data not shown). Both TNFα and IL-1α increased the rate of turnover of HA-p105 (Fig.4 A). In contrast, neither cytokine affected the turnover of HA-p105(S927A), although both induced a p105 mobility shift in SDS-PAGE which was probably due to phosphorylation on amino acids other than serine 927 (20MacKichan M.L.

A current question is whether different RTKs within a single cell target similar or different sets of genes. In this study we have used the ErbB receptor network to explore the relationship between RTK activation and gene expression. We profiled growth factor-stimulated signaling pathway usage and broad gene expression patterns in two human mammary tumor cell lines expressing different complements of ErbB receptors. Although the growth factors epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuregulin (NRG) 1 similarly stimulated Erk1/2 in MDA-MB-361 cells, EGF acting through an EGF receptor/ErbB2 heterodimer preferentially stimulated protein kinase C, and NRG1β acting through an ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer preferentially stimulated Akt. The two growth factors regulated partially overlapping yet distinct sets of genes in these cells. In MDA-MB-453 cells, NRG1β acting through an ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer stimulated prolonged signaling of all pathways examined relative to NRG2β acting through the same heterodimeric receptor species.

Depending on cell type and the identity of the growth factor presented to the cell, a variety of responses are possible, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, survival, migration, and fate specification. A fundamental question in growth factor signaling concerns the mechanisms by which specificity is generated: how do different growth factors elicit different responses within a single cell type, and how do different cell types respond differently to a single growth factor? Cellular responses to growth factors are mediated by cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 that possess an intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity. Growth factor binding stimulates receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on several tyrosine residues, and phosphorylated tyrosines provide docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins that contain Src homology 2 or protein tyrosine binding domains (1Margolis B. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 73-80PubMed Google Scholar, 2van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific recruitment of signaling proteins couples activated RTKs to intracellular signaling cascades that propagate signals to the nucleus to elicit initial changes in gene expression. Growth factor-stimulated expression of immediate early genes (IEGs), or genes whose induction does not require protein synthesis, then lays the foundation for the ultimate cellular response (3Woodgett J.R. Br. Med. Bull. 1989; 45: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 5Winkles J.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 41-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Over the past decade, several signaling cascades connecting activated RTKs to the nucleus have been characterized (6Pawson T. Saxton T.M. Cell. 1999; 97: 675-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For example, activation of the Erk serine/threonine kinases follows the recruitment of the Grb2/SOS complex to receptors and the stimulation of the Ras GTPase. Erk phosphorylation of ternary complex factors leads to the stimulation of genes containing serum response elements in their promoters. Phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) activation by growth factors leads to the phosphorylation of the forkhead and CREB transcription factors through stimulation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, as well as the activation of nuclear factor κB through regulation of IκB kinase. These factors are thought to play a prominent role in the regulation of genes involved in cellular survival and apoptosis. Members of the STAT family of transcription factors may be phosphorylated directly by growth factor receptors to regulate cytokine-inducible genes, and phospholipase C-γ1 can mediate the response of calcium-sensitive genes and protein kinase C (PKC) targets to growth factor stimulation. Through the phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine residues, each RTK has the capacity to stimulate several different signaling cascades. By independently targeting different subsets of genes or by acting in a combinatorial manner to regulate gene expression, the different signaling pathways have the potential to mediate a variety of cellular responses. However, many different RTKs utilize identical signaling pathways in mediating diverse responses to growth factors. Hence, a major question has become how signaling cascades couple growth factor receptors with specific gene expression patterns to mediate a diverse array of cellular responses. One model suggests that RTKs send general signals through a limited number of pathways, and that these signals are interpreted in the target cell by context-specific transcription factors. A series of recent studies with invertebrate model systems support this view. Analysis of the regulatory regions of marker genes for specific late stage developmental events in Drosophila melanogastersuggests that gene expression is markedly dependent on the immediate environment and developmental history of the target cell (7Halfon M.S.

Cell. 2000; 103: 87-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In addition, a single RTK in Caenorhabditis elegans uses a different signaling pathway to mediate the development of two different tissues (10Clandinin T.R. DeModena J.A. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), suggesting that some pathways may be dispensable depending on cellular context. In a mammalian system utilizing immortalized mouse fibroblasts, activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 and the PDGFβ receptor led to identical profiles of gene expression (11Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These observations point to a model whereby pathways emanating from growth factor-activated RTKs are generic and simply provide a “go” signal to pre-primed tissue precursor cells to alter gene expression and initiate tissue development (12Simon M.A. Cell. 2000; 103: 13-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, this model does not easily explain how multipotent stem cells differentially respond to different RTK-binding growth factors, a common theme in mammalian systems. For example, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands act as survival/proliferation factors for many neural precursor cells whereas other growth factors such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and the neuregulins stimulate their differentiation into glial cells or neurons (13Cameron H.A. Hazel T.G. McKay R.D. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 36: 287-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Cultured rat PC12 pheochromacytoma cells are a biochemical model for neural differential RTK signaling. It has been suggested that a quantitative difference in signaling pathway usage, the prolonged activation of the Erk1/2 pathway by nerve growth factor relative to EGF, accounts for the differentiation activity of this factor toward these cells (14Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar). To begin to explore the link between receptor tyrosine kinase activation and gene expression in mammalian cells, we have focused on the ErbB RTK signaling network, a model for the generation of specificity and diversity in growth factor signaling. Signaling through ErbB receptor family members has been observed to play roles in a variety of developmental processes (15Burden S. Yarden Y.

The broad range of cellular responses to EGF-like growth factors makes the ErbB network uniquely suited for addressing fundamental questions pertaining to RTK signaling specificity and cellular response. The network consists of four known RTKs (EGF receptor, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) and more than a dozen EGF-like ligands. Each of the receptors is predicted to couple to unique complements of signaling cascades (34Carraway III, K.L. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 35Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). This, together with their ability to undergo an extensive array of ligand-induced receptor homo- and heterodimerization events, has been proposed to underlie the diverse array of cellular and developmental responses attributed to the EGF-like growth factors in mammals (15Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 36Alroy I. Yarden Y.

In this study we use different EGF-like ligands to differentially stimulate ErbB receptors. We observe that that different ErbB dimeric pairs differentially stimulate intracellular signaling pathways and gene expression. Interestingly, the same dimeric receptor pair, when activated by two different growth factors, also leads to differences in gene expression. MDA-MB-361 and MDA-MB-453 cells were from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described previously (38Crovello C.S. Lai C. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26954-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 39Sweeney C. Lai C. Riese D.J., II Diamonti A.J. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells at 50–60% confluence were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% fetal bovine serum, and then treated with 30 nm growth factor for 2 min at 37 °C. After rinsing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm ZnCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1.5 μg of antibodies. Precipitating receptor monoclonal antibodies used were: anti-epidermal growth factor receptor Ab-1 (clone 528), anti-ErbB2 Ab-4, anti-ErbB3 Ab-4, and anti-ErbB4 Ab-1, all from NeoMarkers. Precipitating signaling protein antibodies used were: rabbit anti-Grb2 and rabbit anti-Cbl from Santa Cruz, rabbit anti-Shc and mouse anti-SHP2 from Transduction Labs, and rabbit anti-p85 described previously (40Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Precipitates were washed three times in wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Precipitated proteins were resolved by 6–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using enhanced chemiluminescence for detection. Blotting antibodies used were: anti-phosphotyrosine RC20, mouse anti-SHP2, and mouse anti-Shc from Transduction Laboratories, rabbit anti-Grb2 and rabbit anti-Cbl from Santa Cruz, and rabbit anti-p85 described previously (40Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Cells in 60-mm dishes were grown to 50–60% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and then treated with 30 nm growth factor for various times at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of 1× sample buffer. 100-μl lysates were resolved by 6–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted with antibodies to phosphorylated kinases, kinase targets, and transcription factors. All antibodies to phosphoproteins were from New England Biolabs and Cell Signaling Technology, and those used were: rabbit anti-pErk1/2(Thr-202,Tyr-204), rabbit anti-pAkt(Ser-473), rabbit anti-pp70(Thr-389,Thr-421,Ser-424), rabbit anti-pp90(Ser-381), rabbit anti-pPKC(pan), rabbit anti-phospho-c-Myc(Thr-58, Ser-62), rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun(Ser-63,Ser-73), and rabbit anti-pCREB(Ser-133). Filters were stripped and re-probed with antibodies to actin (Sigma). Cells in 100-mm dishes were grown to 50–60% confluence, serum-starved overnight, and treated for 1 h with 30 nm growth factor. RNA was harvested from treated cells using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the directions of the manufacturer. cRNA target was prepared from 20 μg of total RNA. Preparation of cRNA target and hybridization to HuGeneFL chips (Affymetrix) has been described previously (11Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 41Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), and is detailed at the Whitehead/MIT Genome Center's Molecular Pattern Recognition web site. Fluorescence intensities were obtained with a laser confocal scanner (Hewlett Packard), and analyzed using GeneChip software (Affymetrix). Each gene sequence is represented on the chips by 20 25-mer oligonucleotides identical to the cDNA of interest and a corresponding control 20 25-mer oligonucleotides containing a mismatch at the thirteenth residue. Expression of each gene sequence is reflected in the fluorescence of the identical series relative to the mismatch series, and is reported by GeneChip software as an “average difference” (AD) value (for a further discussion, see Ref. 11Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). AD values reported for genes on chips corresponding to growth factor-treated samples were normalized to control sample chips by scaling to equivalent total average differences as described previously (41Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). A threshold value of 30 was assigned to genes on all chips with a reported AD value of less than 30. Genes were then sorted for growth factor response according to these normalized, thresholded AD values. Genes that exhibited a difference in AD values between growth factor treatment and control of less than 100 in at least one of duplicate experiments were discarded as either not expressed or not reproducibly regulated by growth factor. To be considered regulated by growth factor, the AD value for a gene must have been 2.5-fold higher or lower with growth factor treatment relative to control in both of duplicate experiments. To be considered preferentially regulated by a given growth factor, the -fold stimulation or suppression by one growth factor must have been 1.5-fold greater or lesser than by the other in both of duplicate experiments. To begin to explore the relationship between activation of RTKs and gene expression, we assessed growth factor-stimulated gene expression in two different cultured human mammary tumor cell lines. MDA-MB-361 cells express modest levels of three of the four ErbB receptor family members. In these cells the activation of different receptor dimeric pairs may be achieved by treating cells with different EGF-like growth factors. MDA-MB-453 cells express abundant ErbB2 and ErbB3, but very little EGF receptor or ErbB4. The stimulation of these cells with the ligands NRG1 and NRG2 leads to the activation of the same receptor dimeric pair, the ErbB2/ErbB3 heterodimer. Numerous studies using model transfected cell systems suggest that different EGF-like growth factors preferentially induce the formation and activation of different ErbB receptor dimeric pairs (42Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 43Pinkas-Kramarski R. Shelly M. Glathe S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. J. Biol.

Two ligands that exhibit markedly different receptor-activating properties are EGF and NRG1β. While EGF binds directly to EGF receptor to stimulate EGF receptor homodimers and EGF receptor/ErbB2 heterodimers, NRG1β binds to either ErbB3 or ErbB4 to induce ErbB2/ErbB3 and ErbB2/ErbB4 heterodimers. In MDA-MB-361 cells EGF strongly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 170-kDa EGF receptor and the 185-kDa ErbB2 protein, and had little effect on ErbB3. NRG1β strongly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and ErbB3 (185 kDa) and had little effect on EGF receptor (Fig.1 A, upper panel). These cells express very low levels of ErbB4, which with prolonged exposure was observed to be stimulated exclusively by NRG1β (data not shown). The initial impact of differential receptor activation is on the first step in signal transduction, the recruitment of Src homology 2 and protein tyrosine binding domain-containing proteins to activated receptors. We examined the association of signaling proteins with activated receptors first by blotting receptor immunoprecipitates with antibodies to signaling proteins (Fig. 1 A, lower two panels). As expected, EGF preferentially stimulated the recruitment of the adaptor protein Grb2 to EGF receptor whereas NRG1β preferentially stimulated the recruitment of this protein to ErbB3. NRG1β also preferentially stimulated the association of p85, the 85-kDa subunit of PI3K, with ErbB3, as demonstrated previously (40Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). We also examined the growth factor-stimulated recruitment of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to complexes with the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, p85, and the negative regulatory protein Cbl (Fig. 1 B). In general each of the signaling proteins associated with the EGF receptor upon EGF treatment, and with 185-kDa ErbB receptors upon NRG1β treatment. The exception was Cbl, which, as suggested previously (45Levkowitz G. Klapper L.N. Tzahar E. Freywald A. Sela M. Yarden Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1117-1125PubMed Google Scholar), responded preferentially to EGF stimulation. However, other ligand-dependent differences in recruitment were also observed. A notable example was p85, which associated similarly with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 47, 55, and 185 kDa after EGF and NRG1β treatment, but preferentially associated with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the 90–130-kDa range in response to EGF. These observations confirm that a major outcome of differential ErbB receptor activation by different EGF-like growth factors is the differential recruitment of intracellular signaling proteins into complexes with activated receptors and other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As expected, differential ErbB receptor stimulation by EGF and NRG1β in MDA-MB-361 cells resulted in the differential stimulation of intracellular serine/threonine kinase cascades, as determined by the phosphorylation of these enzymes in response to growth factor treatment (Fig. 2). The extent and kinetics of activation of Erk1 and Erk2 were similar for the two growth factors, perhaps reflecting the similar levels of Grb2 recruitment to activated receptors. EGF more potently stimulated the phosphorylation of two PKC isoforms, consistent with its preferential recruitment of phospholipase Cγ (46Fedi P. Pierce J.H. di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, NRG1β was reproducibly stronger in stimulating the phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473, consistent with the stronger recruitment of p85 to ErbB3 in response to this factor. Interestingly, EGF preferentially stimulated the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase. Although Akt and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation have both been demonstrated to depend on PI3K, the regulation of p70S6K is complex and not yet fully understood (47Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The ultimate outcome of RTK stimulation by growth factors is the phosphorylation of nuclear factors to elicit changes in transcriptional regulation. To determine whether differential signaling through ErbB receptors might influence transcription factor regulation, we examined the phosphorylation state of three transcription factors, Myc, Jun, and CREB, in response to EGF and NRG1β in MDA-MB-361 cells. Although the phosphorylation of these factors was stimulated by both growth factors, EGF reproducibly elicited a stronger response than did NRG1β (Fig.3 A). Since EGF and NRG1β stimulated overlapping yet distinct patterns of intracellular signaling events in MDA-MB-361 cells, we examined whether the two growth factors also stimulated differences in gene expression. To test this we used Affymetrix HuGeneFL Array chips to simultaneously assess changes in transcript levels of ∼5600 genes after 1 h of growth factor treatment. We observed that, although the levels of a host of mRNAs were similarly elevated by both EGF and NRG1β, many were preferentially elevated by one or the other growth factor. The -fold stimulations observed for a subset of genes is plotted in Fig.3 B. Our analysis revealed 133 genes whose transcript abundance reproducibly changed in response to one or both growth factors. 92 mRNAs were enhanced at least 2.5-fold with growth factor treatment, whereas in two separate experiments 41 mRNAs were suppressed by at least 2.5-fold. Interestingly, despite its weaker potency in stimulating several signaling cascades, NRG1β was the stronger factor in regulating mRNA levels. 44 mRNAs were preferentially elevated by NRG1β, where the -fold induction by this growth factor was at least 1.5-fold greater than that of EGF, compared with 18 mRNAs that were preferentially elevated by EGF. Likewise, 20 mRNAs were preferentially suppressed by NRG1β by at least a 1.5-fold margin compared with 10 mRNAs that were preferentially suppressed by EGF. Table I shows an abbreviated list of genes regulated by growth factors in MDA-MB-361 cells. (A full list of growth factor-responsive genes is provided as supplementary material in the on-line edition of this article.) Particularly noteworthy is the distribution of known IEGs, indicated in Table I and in Fig.3 B by an asterisk. mRNA levels of most IEGs were similarly stimulated by both EGF and NRG1β, suggesting that overlapping pathways elicited by the two growth factors may be responsible for the r"
https://openalex.org/W2077613098,"Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a compound naturally occurring in Brassica vegetables, can induce a G(1) cell cycle arrest of human MCF-7 breast cancer cells that is accompanied by the selective inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) expression. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of CDK6 mRNA decay rates revealed that I3C had no effect on CDK6 transcript stability. We report the first identification and functional characterization of the CDK6 promoter in order to determine whether I3C inhibits CDK6 transcription. In MCF-7 cells stably transfected with CDK6 promoter-linked luciferase reporter plasmids, I3C inhibited CDK6 promoter activity in an I3C-specific response that was not a consequence of the growth-arrested state of the cells. Deletion analysis revealed a 167-base pair I3C-responsive region of the CDK6 promoter between -805 and -638. Site-specific mutations within this region revealed that both Sp1 and Ets-like sites, which are spaced 5 base pairs apart, were necessary for I3C responsiveness in the context of the CDK6 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of protein-DNA complexes formed with nuclear proteins isolated from I3C-treated and -untreated cells, in combination with supershift assays using Sp1 antibodies, demonstrated that the Sp1-binding site in the CDK6 promoter forms a specific I3C-responsive DNA-protein complex that contains the Sp1 transcription factor. Taken together, our results suggest that I3C down-regulates CDK6 transcription by targeting Sp1 at a composite DNA site in the CDK6 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2071290544,"Epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) and short consensus repeat (SCR) domains are commonly found in cell surface and soluble proteins that mediate specific protein-protein recognition events. Unlike the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, very little is known about the general properties of intermolecular interactions encoded by these common modules, and in particular, how specificity of binding is achieved. We have dissected the binding of CD97 (a member of the EGF-TM7 family) to the complement regulator CD55, two cell surface modular proteins that contain EGF and SCR domains, respectively. We demonstrate that the interaction is mediated solely by these domains and is characterized by a low affinity (86 μm) and rapid off-rate (at least 0.6 s−1). The interaction is Ca2+ -dependent but is unaffected by glycosylation of the EGF domains. Using biotinylated multimerized peptides in cell binding assays and surface plasmon resonance, we show that a CD97-related EGF-TM7 molecule (termed EMR2), differing by only three amino acids within the EGF domains, binds CD55 with aKD at least an order of magnitude weaker than that of CD97. These results suggest that low affinity cell-cell interactions may be a general feature of highly expressed cell surface proteins and that specificity of SCR-EGF binding can be finely tuned by a small number of amino acid changes on the EGF module surface.

In recent years high resolution structures of many of the most common domains have become available, and analysis of the kinetic characteristics of the interactions they mediate is increasing our understanding of processes that underlie the most basic cellular interactions. In particular, cell adhesion interactions mediated by proteins of the Ig superfamily are characterized by multiple weak binding events, each with a low affinity, but with the multivalent nature of the cell surface proteins resulting in a cell-cell interaction of high avidity (1Davis S.J. Ikemizu S. Wild M.K. van der Merwe P.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Two of the most common structural modules used in cell surface proteins are the epidermal growth factor-like (EGF)1 and short consensus repeat (SCR) domains (Fig. 1). Recent analysis of the human genome (as of March 1, 2001) shows that the EGF family is the fifth most common protein family with 3% of all potential proteins containing EGF domains whereas SCR domains are found in 0.3% of all proteins. Both of these domain types are commonly used to mediate protein-protein interactions. The EGF module, which often occurs as multiple tandem repeats, is widely distributed among extracellular proteins involved in adhesion, receptor-ligand interactions, extracellular matrix structure, determination of cell fate, and blood coagulation (see Fig. 1). A subset of EGF domains contains a consensus sequence associated with calcium binding (cb): (D/N)X(D/N)(E/Q)Xm(D/N)*Xn(Y/F), where m and n are variable and the asterisk indicates possible ;-hydroxylation (2Handford P.A.

Calcium is thought to perform a key role in the orientation of cbEGF pairs by restricting conformational flexibility of interdomain linkages (5Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M.

SCR domains are frequently found among proteins of the complement system with many of the complement regulatory proteins (e.g. CD55 and CD46, see below) and complement receptors (e.g. CD21 and CD35) consisting entirely of repeated SCR domains. Structural studies (5Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar,9Casasnovas J.M. Larvie M. Stehle T.

Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) reveal that both of these small modules (<60 amino acids) fold to form all β-strand domains strengthened by disulfide bonds (two in the case of SCRs and three for EGFs). An understanding of why these domains are so well suited for protein interactions has been hindered by the fact that the disulfide-rich multidomain constructs required for structural analyses are difficult to produce in large yields in the native form. We therefore have very few structures of complexes involving these common modules and no structures of EGF-SCR complexes or kinetic characterization of the interaction. CD55 (or Decay Accelerating Factor; DAF) is a member of the regulators of complement activation (RCA) family. It protects host cells from complement system attack by binding to C3b and C4b preventing formation of the membrane attack complex. It has a widespread tissue distribution and is expressed at high levels on many different cell types. The protein consists of an N-terminal extracellular portion of four SCR domains linked via a heavily O-glycosylated spacer to a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (Fig.1). SCR domains 2–4 are involved in regulation of complement and also in binding to a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. The most N-terminal SCR (domain 1) also provides the site of interaction for some viruses but until recently the native role of domain 1 was unknown. However, identification of CD97 as a cellular ligand for the N-terminal domains of CD55 (12Hamann J. Vogel B. van Schijndel G.M. van Lier R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13Hamann J. Stortelers C. Kiss-Toth E. Vogel B. Eichler W. van Lier R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) has now demonstrated a novel natural function associated with this portion of the molecule. CD97 is a member of the EGF-TM7 family, characterized by the unique chimeric structure in which tandem EGF repeats are coupled to a G protein-coupled receptor moiety via a mucin-like stalk region (14McKnight A.J. Gordon S. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 283-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15McKnight A.J. Gordon S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 63: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CD97 is constitutively expressed on granulocytes and monocytes and is rapidly up-regulated on activated T and B cells. It is known to exist in a variety of splice forms containing different numbers of the EGF domains (16Gray J.X. Haino M. Roth M.J. Maguire J.E. Jensen P.N. Yarme A. Stetler-Stevenson M.A. Siebenlist U. Kelly K. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5438-5447PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hamann J. Eichler W. Hamann D. Kerstens H.M. Poddighe P.J. Hoovers J.M. Hartmann E. Strauss M. van Lier R.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1942-1950PubMed Google Scholar) each of which binds CD55 with different affinities. The CD55 binding splice variant with the highest affinity comprises three EGF domains (domains 1, 2, and 5), two of which (domains 2 and 5) are predicted to bind calcium (Fig. 1). Although the precise role of the CD55-CD97 interaction is still unknown the unique hybrid structure, the leukocyte-restricted expression pattern of CD97, and the presence of both CD97 and CD55 in arthritic joints (18Hamann J. Wishaupt J.O. van Lier R.A. Smeets T.J. Breedveld F.C. Tak P.P. Arthr. Rheum. 1999; 42: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggest possible roles for the CD97-CD55 interaction in adhesion and signaling within the inflammatory and immune responses. Recently a novel EGF-TM7 molecule, EMR2, sharing highly homologous EGF domains with CD97 but failing to show an interaction with CD55 in biological assays was identified (19Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study we probe the biophysical, cellular, and molecular properties of the CD55 and CD97 interaction and investigate the sequence-specific requirements for CD55 binding. We show that the interaction is mediated solely by the EGF domains of CD97 and is characterized by a low affinity and rapid off-rate. Ca2+ is essential for the formation of the CD55 binding face on CD97, but glycosylation of EGF domains from CD97 is not required. The three amino acid differences within the EGF domains of EMR2 that distinguish it from CD97 decrease the affinity for CD55 by at least an order of magnitude. The implications of these data for general properties of cell surface interactions and specificity of EGF domain interactions are discussed. All chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. CD97 monoclonal Abs, BL-Ac/F2, CLB-CD97/1, CLB-CD97/2, and CLB-CD97/3 were kindly provided by Dr. Jörg Hamann (Dept. of Immunobiology, CLB, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands). cDNA for CD97 was a kind gift of Dr. Celestine O'Shaugnessey (Dept. of Neuropharmacology, GlaxoWellcome, Stevenage, UK). The three extracellular EGF domains (EGF-1,2,5) of the CD55 binding splice variant of CD97 and (by analogy) of EMR2 were expressed inEscherichia coli using a His tag-based expression system (Qiagen). Primers used for the PCR amplification of EGF domains 1, 2, and 5 from CD97 and EMR2 cDNAs were 5′-TAGTAGGGATCCATAGAAGGACGATCAGCAGACTCCAGGGGCTGTGCC (forward) and 5′-TAGTAGAAGCTTCTATTATTCACAGACAGTGTCCTTTTG (reverse). Restriction sites used for subsequent cloning into the expression vector pQE30 are underlined. The forward primer also contains a FXa cleavage site and a two-amino acid (SA) spacer sequence prior to the authentic sequence of CD97 and EMR2. Following Ni2+ affinity purification under denaturing conditions, peptides were reduced, purified, and refolded according to a well established in vitro refolding protocol (2Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The data indicating that the multidomain constructs adopted the native fold was indirect but substantial. Both peptides showed the characteristic change in HPLC elution profile previously observed for all other cbEGF constructs on refolding (e.g. the profile for EMR2 is shown in Fig. 2). Because calcium binding is a property of the native fold of cbEGF domains, correct refolding of these domains in CD97 and EMR2 was indicated by the observed Ca2+-dependent protection against proteolysis (data not shown) and the Ca2+ dependence of CD55-CD97 interaction (see “Results”). After purification, CD97 and EMR2 were lyophilized and reconstituted into appropriate buffers at the desired concentration. The concentration of protein solutions was confirmed using the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm(21,000 m−1 cm−1 computed from the amino acid composition on the EXPASY server, Ref. 20Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The expression of the four SCR domains of CD55 as a soluble fragment in the yeast Pichia pastoris has been described in detail elsewhere (21Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed (10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer, Pierce) against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH7.5 to remove imidazole and concentrated to ∼0.8 mg/ml using a 3000 molecular weight cut-off Centriprep 3 (3500 rpm, 120 min). The concentration of protein was assessed using the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm (36,840 m−1 cm−1(20Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Hochstrasser D.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 258-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar)). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments were performed on a BIAcore2000 (BIACORE AB, Stevenage, UK). CD55 was covalently immobilized to the carboxylated dextran matrix on the surface of CM5 sensor chips via primary amine coupling using the amine-coupling kit (BIAcore AB) as directed (22Lea S.M. Powell R.M. McKee T. Evans D.J. Brown D. Stuart D.I. van der Merwe P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30443-30447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After the activation step, purified CD55 was injected at 11 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.6) for 5 min (5 μl/min). This repeatedly resulted in the coupling of ∼1000 response units (RU) of CD55 to the chip surface. Biotinylated CD97 was coupled to the chip surface via streptavidin according to the protocol provided by Biacore. Interaction data were collected by injecting 30 μl of the appropriate analyte over the coupled chip surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C, and all traces were corrected for refractive index changes by subtraction of a control trace simultaneously recorded from a mock-immobilized channel. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were carried out in a buffer (I = 0.15) 5 mm Ca2+, 135 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. All the expression vectors described below were constructed in pcDNA3.1 (InVitrogen). The EMR2 and CD97 expression vectors containing five EGF-like and three EGF-like domains, EMR2 (EGF-1,2,3,4,5), EMR2 (EGF-1,2,5), CD97 (EGF-1,2,3,4,5) and CD97 (EGF-1,2,5), have been described previously (19Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The constructs for the EMR2/CD97 domain-swapping chimeras were made by ligating the DNA fragment of the EGF-1,2,5 domain of EMR2 or CD97 to that of the stalk region of CD97 or EMR2, which was ligated in frame with the 7TM region of EMR2. Similarly, the EMR2 and CD97 deletion constructs, ΔEMR2 and ΔCD97, were made by ligating the respective EGF-1, 2, 5 domains with the 7TM region of EMR2. The EGF-1,2,5 domains of EMR2 and CD97 were amplified by PCR using primers KE5 (5′-GCTGGTACCATGGGAGGCCGCGTCTTTCTCG-3′) and KE3 (5′-TCGAATTCACAGACAGTGTCCTTTTGGTTATTCGG-3′). Likewise, the stalk regions of EMR2 and CD97 were generated using the primer sets EB5 (5′-CTGTGAATTCGATATGACTTTCTCCACCACCTGGACC-3′) with EB3–1 (5′-AGCACGGGATCCTCCTCCTGCACATC-3′) and EB5 with EB3–2 (5′-TCAGATCTTTCCAGTCCTCCACGTCATAATGAG-3′), respectively. Specific restriction enzyme sites (underlined) were incorporated in the primers to facilitate the cloning. Site-directed mutants of EMR2 (EMR2-D36N, EMR2-M62T, EMR2-L74P) and CD97 (CD97-N33D, CD97-T59M, CD97-P71L) were made using the EGF-1,2,5 domains of EMR2 and CD97 as template, respectively. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer (GeneEditor Mutagenesis System,Promega). The resulting mutated EGF-1,2,5 DNA fragments were excised, purified, and ligated with the stalk region of CD97 followed in frame by the 7TM region of EMR2. For the construction of vectors expressing soluble biotinylated proteins, the DNA fragment encoding the consensus peptide sequence, NSGSLHHILDAQKMVWNHR*, recognized by the E. coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase BirA (23Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), was generated by PCR using Bio5 (5′-TAGTAGGGATCCGAATTCCGGATCACTGCATCATATT-3′) and Bio3 (5′-TAGTAGGGGCCCTTAACGATGATTCCACACC-3′) primers and HLA A2 plasmid construct as template (24Altman J.D. Moss P.A. Goulder P.J. Barouch D.H. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Bell J.I. McMichael A.J. Davis M.M. Science. 1996; 274: 94-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). Following BamHI andApaI digestion, the DNA fragment was subcloned immediately downstream of the stalk region of EMR2 in pcDNA3.1. Wild-type or site-directed mutant EGF-like domains of EMR2 or CD97 were then inserted into the vector upstream of the EMR2 stalk region. The final constructs therefore contained various EGF-like domains followed by the EMR2 stalk region, a biotinylation signal and a stop codon. All culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and cells were incubated in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, K562 cells in RPMI 1640 (R10), and CHO-K1 cells in Ham's F-12 medium. CHO-K1 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293T cells were transfected with 40 μg of DNA/175-cm2 flask using calcium phosphate precipitation. Six hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with 15 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for a further 72 h. Cell rosette assays were performed as previously described (19Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO-K1 cells transfected with the appropriate expression vectors were subcultured at day 1 into 12-well dishes and analyzed for their ability to bind human red blood cells 3 days post-transfection. Heparinized human whole blood cells were diluted 1:100 (vol/vol) in R10 and added to transfected cells (1 ml/well) for 30 min at room temperature. Nonbinding red blood cells were removed by gentle washing. The extent of red blood cell adhesion was quantified by measuring the peroxidase activity of hemoglobin (E450) of methanol-fixed red blood cells using the TMB substrate. The level of cell surface protein expression on transfected cells was determined by FACS analysis using appropriate CD97 mAbs. For cells transfected with EMR2 and CD97 isoforms as well as the domain-swapping and deletion chimeras, CLB-CD97/1 and BL-Ac/F2, which recognize the first EGF-like domain of both EMR2 and CD97, were used. CLB-CD97/2 and CLB-CD97/3, which specifically recognize the stalk region of CD97, were used for cells transfected with the EMR2 and CD97 site-directed mutants. The red blood cell binding ability of transfected cells was represented by the measurement of peroxidase activities normalized by the median level of cell surface protein expression determined by FACS analysis. Conditioned medium collected from transfected HEK293T cells was concentrated to ∼0.5 ml using a 30-kDa cut-off Centriprep tube (Millipore, Bedford, MA), dialyzed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 buffer and incubated with 1 μl of BirA enzyme (Avidity, Denver, CO) overnight at room temperature. Excess biotin was subsequently removed by dialysis with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3 buffer containing 10 mmCaCl2 and 150 mm NaCl. The biotinylated proteins were then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C after quantification by dot-blot analysis using myelin basic protein-biotin (Avidity, Denver, CO) as standard. Cell binding assays using fluorescent beads coupled to biotinylated proteins were performed as previously described (23Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μl of avidin-coated fluorescent beads (Spherotech, Inc., Libertyville, IL) were washed twice and added to 2 μg of biotinylated protein in a total volume of 50 μl. The bead and protein mixture was sonicated at 20% power for 1 min (Heat systems, Sonicator) and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Nonbinding proteins were removed by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin, and the beads were resuspended in 50 μl of R10. The bead-protein complex was sonicated again immediately before adding to K562 cells in a 96-well plate (1 × 106 cells/50 μl R10/well). The cell-bead mixture was spun at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min, incubated for a further 40 min at 4 °C, and finally resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for FACS analysis. Where necessary, additional reagents (divalent cations, EGTA, and mAbs) were added to the cells 5–10 min before the introduction of the protein-bead complex. Previous studies have demonstrated that the EGF domains of CD97 are necessary for CD97-CD55 interaction (13Hamann J. Stortelers C. Kiss-Toth E. Vogel B. Eichler W. van Lier R.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and that EMR2 is unable to interact with CD55 (19Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CD97 and EMR2 share highly homologous EGF domains but are relatively variant (∼50% identical) within the supporting stalk region. To investigate the possible contribution of the stalk region to the previously observed CD55 binding activity of CD97, domain-swapping chimeras and stalk region deletion mutants were analyzed (Fig. 3) using a quantitative cell rosetting assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Proteins containing the EGF-1,2,5 domains of CD97 and the stalk region of EMR2 are CD97-like in their CD55 binding properties, whereas constructs consisting of the EGF domains of EMR2 and the stalk of CD97 are EMR2-like showing no CD55 binding activity in this assay. Deletion of the CD97 stalk retains the ability of CD97 to bind CD55 but reduces the overall binding by ∼60%. We interpret the reduced binding to CD55 observed on deletion of the CD97 stalk as being caused by steric effects; in the absence of the CD97 stalk the EGF domains are less accessible to the cell-bound CD55. Support for this interpretation comes from our surface plasmon resonance studies (see below) that show that constructs of CD97 with or without the stalk have identical affinities for soluble CD55. Controls used in this experiment confirm that different isoforms of CD97 have different CD55 binding abilities with the shortest CD97 isoform, CD97 (EGF-1,2,5), having the highest affinity (100%) whereas the longest isoform, CD97 (EGF-1,2,3,4,5), shows only ∼20% of the CD55 binding affinity. All EMR2 isoforms showed no detectable binding to CD55 in this assay (19Lin H.H. Stacey M. Hamann J. Gordon S. McKnight A.J. Genomics. 2000; 67: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to study the detailed interaction kinetics between domains from CD55 and CD97 implicated in complex formation. Protein constructs consisting of four SCR domains from CD55 and the three EGF domains from CD97 with or without the stalk (Fig. 1) were expressed and purified (see “Experimental Procedures”). SPR measurements were obtained for proteins in both orientations, i.e. either fixed to a static surface or in solution. The CD97 used in the soluble phase consisted of the EGF domains alone and was not glycosylated because it was derived from an E. coli expression system (see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, the CD97 bound to the chip containing the full stalk region and was glycosylated because it was obtained using a mammalian cell expression system. Fig.4 a(i) shows an injection of 5 μm CD55 (bar) for 90 s over a chip with 350 RU of CD97 bound whereas Fig.4 b(i) shows an injection 64 μm CD97 (bar) for 90 s over a chip with CD55 bound. A background response is seen in the control trace of each experiment because the BIAcore measures the refractive index near the sensor surface and therefore detects any changes in the bulk refractive index of the injected sample. The response seen when soluble protein is injected over its bound ligand is considerably larger than the response seen in the control trace in each case. Inspection of both sets of sensorgrams reveals that the kinetics of the CD97-CD55 interaction are rapid; binding reaches equilibrium within 10 s of the start of the injection, and dissociation is complete within 20 s of the end of the injection. Fig. 4, a(ii) andb(ii) show a series of sensorgrams obtained by injecting a dilution series of the appropriate soluble protein (either CD55 or CD97) over the chip surface. The traces shown are corrected by subtraction of the control trace and overlaid so that the start and end points of the injections are coincident. The ratios of the maximal levels of free-flowing protein bound to the level of coupled protein (both measured in RU and corrected for molecular weight) revealed that ∼45% of the covalently coupled CD55 was able to interact with the soluble CD97 whereas ∼60% of the bound CD97 was able to interact with soluble CD55. In the case of data recorded from the CD97-coupled chip, the control curve was recorded from a channel on which an unrelated protein was bound (maltose-binding protein) rather than a simply mock-immobilized chip surface. Equilibrium binding responses were subsequently measured during injection of at least six concentrations of the soluble protein varying by at least one order of magnitude, and the data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB). Nonlinear curve fitting of a simple Langmuir model of the association (A + B → AB) to these data (Fig. 4, a(iii) and b(iii)) yielded values for the dissociation constant, KD.KD was also determined from Scatchard plots of the data (fits not shown). Identical results were obtained irrespective of the order of injections (low to high concentrations or vice versa), indicating that both the CD55 and CD97 were stable for the duration of the experiment (data not shown). Table Isummarizes the values of KD obtained from different experiments (using protein expressed in different preparations) and the quality of the nonlinear fits to the data. The mean of all the experiments yielded a value for KD of 86 ± 1 μm. The estimates of KD were the same in whichever orientation the experiment was performed (i.e.CD55 or CD97 immobilized on the chip surface) suggesting that the value of KD obtained provides a true representation of thein vivo affinity and is not subject to coupling effects. Because KD is the same for both the soluble and immobilized forms of CD97, glycosylation and the stalk region are not required for CD55 binding. Simultaneous fitting of numerically integrated rate equations derived from the simple Langmuir binding model (A + B → AB) to the sets of sensorgrams (global analysis option BIAevaluation 3.0) shows that the off-rate is at least 0.6 s−1 (data not shown).Table IValues for KD obtained by non-linear fits to equilibrium binding data as presented in Fig. 3Protein fixed on chip1-aEach row shows the data from one series of experiments.Soluble proteinKDχ2μm350RU CD97CD55851.4350RU CD97CD55860.81240RU CD55CD97871.01240RU CD55CD97870.9Mean ± SD86 ± 11.0 ± 0.31-a Each row shows the data from one series of experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2011210199,"The intracellular traffic of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in muscle cells remains largely unexplored. Here we make use of L6 myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4 with an exofacially directed Myc-tag (GLUT4myc) to determine the exocytic and endocytic rates of the transporter. Insulin caused a rapid (t 12 = 4 min) gain, whereas hyperosmolarity (0.45m sucrose) caused a slow (t 12 = 20 min) gain in surface GLUT4myc molecules. With prior insulin stimulation followed by addition of hypertonic sucrose, the increase in surface GLUT4myc was partly additive. Unlike the effect of insulin, the GLUT4myc gain caused by hyperosmolarity was insensitive to wortmannin or to tetanus toxin cleavage of VAMP2 and VAMP3. Disappearance of GLUT4myc from the cell surface was rapid (t 12 = 1.5 min). Insulin had no effect on the initial rate of GLUT4myc internalization. In contrast, hyperosmolarity almost completely abolished GLUT4myc internalization. Surface GLUT4myc accumulation in response to hyperosmolarity was only partially blocked by inhibition of tyrosine kinases with erbstatin analog (erbstatin A) and genistein. However, neither inhibitor interfered with the ability of hyperosmolarity to block GLUT4myc internalization. We propose that hyperosmolarity increases surface GLUT4myc by preventing GLUT4 endocytosis and stimulating its exocytosis via a pathway independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and of VAMP2 or VAMP3. A tetanus toxin-insensitive v-SNARE such as TI-VAMP detected in these cells, might mediate membrane fusion of the hyperosmolarity-sensitive pool.

In contrast, hyperosmolarity almost completely abolished GLUT4myc internalization. Surface GLUT4myc accumulation in response to hyperosmolarity was only partially blocked by inhibition of tyrosine kinases with erbstatin analog (erbstatin A) and genistein. However, neither inhibitor interfered with the ability of hyperosmolarity to block GLUT4myc internalization. We propose that hyperosmolarity increases surface GLUT4myc by preventing GLUT4 endocytosis and stimulating its exocytosis via a pathway independent of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and of VAMP2 or VAMP3. A tetanus toxin-insensitive v-SNARE such as TI-VAMP detected in these cells, might mediate membrane fusion of the hyperosmolarity-sensitive pool. glucose transporter 4 o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride HEPES-modified RPMI tetanus toxin phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase erbstatin analog vesicle-associated membrane protein tetanus toxin-insensitive VAMP green fluorescence protein enhanced GFP minimal essential medium phosphate-buffered saline trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane soluble NSF accessory protein SNAP receptor The glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)1 is the predominant glucose transporter of muscle and adipose cells.

Little is known about the traffic of this transporter in muscle cells, despite the fact that muscle represents the largest in vivo site of glucose utilization.Insulin shifts the subcellular distribution of GLUT4 resulting in a new steady state where a large fraction of GLUT4 resides at the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle (11Douen A.G.

The contribution of exocytic and endocytic pathways to insulin action in muscle cells has not been explored.Exposing 3T3-L1 adipocytes to hyperosmolar solutions also leads to the cell surface accumulation of GLUT4. It was postulated that this accumulation results from the stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis by signals different from those elicited by insulin (19Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 20Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through a so-called “alternative pathway.” However, the steady-state analysis used in those studies precluded the distinction of exocytic from endocytic traffic of GLUT4. The well-known effect of hyperosmolarity to disrupt clathrin function (22Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 877-886Google Scholar) has prompted us to hypothesize that hyperosmolarity accumulates GLUT4 at the cell surface by inhibiting GLUT4 endocytosis. We have previously characterized a clone of L6 myoblasts stably expressing GLUT4 tagged with an exofacial myc epitope (GLUT4myc) (24Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which could be used to more accurately measure GLUT4 endocytosis in response to different stimuli.The objective of this study was to investigate how insulin and hyperosmolarity affect the recycling of GLUT4 in L6 muscle cells in culture, to examine how each stimulus modulates the endocytic and exocytic arms of GLUT4 traffic, and to compare the characteristics of the donor pools of GLUT4 in each instance. We show that both insulin and hyperosmolarity induce the subcellular redistribution of GLUT4 from intracellular loci to the plasma membrane in L6 myoblasts. Whereas insulin primarily stimulates GLUT4 exocytosis, hyperosmolarity largely prevents its endocytosis. Although inhibition of tyrosine kinases prevents significantly insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis, it does not affect the hyperosmolarity-induced block of GLUT4 internalization and only partially blocks hyperosmolarity-triggered GLUT4 accumulation at the cell surface. The results suggest that insulin draws GLUT4 from a specific pool that is affected by tetanus toxin and wortmannin. In contrast, the accumulation of GLUT4 at the cell surface caused by hyperosmolarity results from both reducing GLUT4 endocytosis and stimulating its exocytosis. Hyperosmolarity is likely to draw GLUT4 from the recycling endosomal pool and/or an “alternative pool” that is insensitive to inhibition by tetanus toxin and wortmannin.DISCUSSIONGLUT4 is a determinant of insulin sensitivity in muscle and fat cells. In the L6 skeletal muscle cell line, GLUT4 expression occurs after differentiation from myoblasts into myotubes (26Mitsumoto Y. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4957-4962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that expression of GLUT4myc in L6 myoblasts leads to the segregation of the protein to a GLUT4-specific pool, conferring insulin sensitivity to glucose uptake (24Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This conclusion is based on the finding that, in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts, the intracellular GLUT4myc compartment contains the majority of the insulin-regulatable amino peptidase but less than half of the GLUT1, and the sensitivity of glucose uptake to insulin is markedly improved. Indeed, we confirm in the present study that 90% of the GLUT4myc resides intracellularly. 2In a previous report, a shorter incubation time with 0.1% Triton X-100 resulted in incomplete cell permeabilization and underestimation of the intracellular content of GLUT4myc (24Ueyama A. Yaworsky K.L. Wang Q. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E572-E578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon insulin or hypertonic sucrose stimulation, 30% of the total cellular GLUT4myc is redistributed to the cell surface within 30 min. These results demonstrate that, as with previous observations in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, GLUT4myc is vastly retained in the intracellular pool in the basal state and is redistributed to the cell surface in response to insulin and hyperosmolarity in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts.Insulin Stimulates GLUT4 Exocytosis and Hyperosmolarity Inhibits Its InternalizationGLUT4myc undergoes rapid internalization upon insulin removal. Half of the surface-labeled GLUT4myc is internalized within 3 min. Even in the presence of insulin, the rate of GLUT4myc internalization is not appreciably slowed down, having approximately the same t 12 of 3 min. These results suggest that insulin does not regulate GLUT4 internalization in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts. This contrasts with observations made in fat cells where a small proportion of insulin-induced gain in surface GLUT4 appears to be due to inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis (1Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Jhun B.H. Rampal A.L. Liu H. Lachaal M. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17710-17715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3-min half-time measured for GLUT4myc internalization in L6 myoblasts is very similar to the 4.2- or 3-min half-time for GLUT4 or insulin-regulatable amino peptidase endocytosis, respectively, reported for 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the presence of insulin (1Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Garza L.A. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). K+depletion and hypertonic shock are two strategies known to perturb the formation of clathrin coats (22Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 23Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 877-886Google Scholar, 41Larkin J.M. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1983; 33: 273-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) by preventing the interaction between clathrin and adaptors proteins (22Hansen S.H. Sandvig K. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that K+ depletion mimics hyperosmolarity by causing a gain in GLUT4myc at the cell surface and preventing GLUT4myc endocytosis. These results strongly support the concept that hyperosmolarity accumulates GLUT4 at the cell surface, at least in part, through inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis.Hyperosmolarity is a stress stimulus that activates a tyrosine kinase pathway (19Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 45Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18114-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and tyrosine kinase activity is required for the surface gain in GLUT4 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that this effect is related to the retention of GLUT4 at the cell surface, because an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases, erbstatin A, was unable to prevent the inhibition of GLUT4myc endocytosis by hyperosmolarity in muscle cells (Fig. 9 C). Erbstatin A and genistein prevented the hyperosmolarity-induced GLUT4 externalization by only ∼50% (Fig. 9, A and B). We propose that inhibition of GLUT4 endocytosis accounts for 50% of the GLUT4 surface accumulation, and the remaining 50% arises from the stimulation of GLUT4 exocytosis in response to hyperosmolarity. Chenet al. (19Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) reported complete prevention of hyperosmolarity-induced GLUT4 translocation by inhibition of tyrosine kinases. Therefore, it is conceivable that GLUT4 endocytosis is not blocked by hyperosmolarity in 3T3-L1 cells.Insulin and Hyperosmolarity Draw GLUT4 from Different Intracellular PoolsGLUT4 accumulated at the cell surface with very different time courses in response to insulin and hypertonic sucrose. We speculate that there may be an insulin-regulated exocytic GLUT4 pool in L6 muscle cells, which can be rapidly mobilized by insulin and that hyperosmolarity draws GLUT4 from an alternative pool of GLUT4 and/or the recycling endosomes. Supporting this concept that insulin and hyperosmolarity draw GLUT4 from different intracellular pools in L6 muscle cells is their differential sensitivity to tetanus toxin.VAMP2 and VAMP3 are expressed in muscle and fat cells (46Cain C.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8233-8240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown earlier (40Randhawa V.K. Bilan P.J. Khayat Z.A. Daneman N. Liu Z. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Peng X.R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and confirmed here, tetanus toxin reduced the insulin-dependent GLUT4myc translocation in L6 myoblasts. Our previous study also demonstrated that the reduction can be rescued by the tetanus toxin-resistant mutant VAMP2 but not by the toxin-resistant mutant VAMP3, suggesting that VAMP2 but not VAMP3 is required for GLUT4 vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane in response to insulin (40Randhawa V.K. Bilan P.J. Khayat Z.A. Daneman N. Liu Z. Ramlal T. Volchuk A. Peng X.R. Coppola T. Regazzi R. Trimble W.S. Klip A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2403-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We now show that expression of tetanus toxin does not alter GLUT4myc externalization caused by hyperosmolarity. These results support the concept that insulin and hyperosmolarity recruit GLUT4 from different intracellular pools, one requiring VAMP2 and another one that is tetanus toxin-insensitive. Thus, neither VAMP2 nor VAMP3 are the fusogenic v-SNARE for the incorporation of GLUT4 vesicles from recycling endosomes into the plasma membrane. It is conceivable that a tetanus toxin-insensitive VAMP such as TI-VAMP (49Galli T. Zahraoui A. Vaidyanathan V.V. Raposo G. Tian J.M. Karin M. Niemann H. Louvard D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) could mediate fusion of the recycling endosome with the plasma membrane in muscle cells. Indeed, TI-VAMP was detected in L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts, and its localization was partially distinct from that of VAMP2 or VAMP3. The possible role of TI-VAMP in fusion of the hyperosmolarity-drawn pool is under investigation.The action of insulin and hyperosmolarity on GLUT4myc externalization was partly additive. A previous study failed to observe an additive effect in 3T3-L1 adipocytes where the cells were pretreated with hyperosmolar solution prior to exposure to insulin (20Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also failed to observe any additive effect when we incubated L6-GLUT4myc myoblasts in the same manner. The lack of additivity under these latter conditions may be due to the inhibition of insulin signaling by hyperosmolarity at the level of Akt, as reported previously (20Chen D. Fucini R.V. Olson A.L. Hemmings B.A. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4684-4694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, treating L6 muscle cells with insulin, followed by the addition of hyperosmolar solution, caused a further increase in the surface GLUT4myc compared with the effect of either stimulus alone. Hypertonic sucrose must draw GLUT4myc from an alternative GLUT4 pool and/or recycling endosomal pool to account for the appearance of additional GLUT4myc at the cell surface, and as shown in Fig. 7, also retains GLUT4myc at the cell surface. Hence, hyperosmolarity causes a compounded gain of GLUT4 molecules at the cell surface.Lastly, insulin and hyperosmolarity engage different signals in their action. PI3K activation is required for insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation in fat and muscle cells (29Tsakiridis T. McDowell H. Walker T. Downes P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A.

In contrast, the hyperosmolarity-induced accumulation of GLUT4 at the cell surface is not prevented by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19Chen D. Elmendorf J.S. Olson A.L. Li X. Earp H.S. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27401-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 3A small inhibition was seen in one study using wortmannin concentrations of 100 nm or higher, which might have inhibited other pathways (21Janez A. Worrall D.S. Imamura T. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26870-26876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that PI3K activity is not required for GLUT4myc externalization caused by hyperosmolarity in L6 myoblasts.Current models suggest that in 3T3-L1 adipocytes the increased amount of GLUT4 at the surface in response to insulin is due to recruitment of GLUT4 from a putatively static exocytic pool and from a continuously recycling pool (54Rice J.E. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 55Fletcher L.M. Tavaré J.M. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28087-28095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in muscle cells a major effect of insulin is to cause GLUT4myc exocytosis from a specific pool (likely specialized vesicles), which is distinct from the pool mobilized by hyperosmolarity and from the basal-state recycling pool. Fig. 10 illustrates the pathways of intracellular GLUT4 traffic highlighted by this study.In summary, the majority (90%) of GLUT4myc is located intracellularly in L6 myoblasts in the basal state. In the presence of insulin, 70% of GLUT4myc resides intracellularly and 30% recycles back to the cell surface with a t 12 of ∼4 min. Under hyperosmolar stress, 65% of the GLUT4myc remains intracellularly and 35% recycles with a t 12 of ∼20 min. Insulin and hyperosmolarity draw GLUT4 from different pools. Insulin recruits GLUT4 primarily from a specialized pool that requires the participation of PI3K and VAMP2. Hyperosmolarity accelerates GLUT4 exocytosis from an alternative pool and/or the recycling pool that are PI3K-independent and tetanus toxin-insensitive, and it also retains the GLUT4 molecules at the cell surface by blocking their endocytosis. This latter action significantly contributes to the accumulation of GLUT4 at the cell surface by hyperosmolarity. The possible interconnections among the specialized, alternative, and recycling pools require further investigation. The glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)1 is the predominant glucose transporter of muscle and adipose cells. In untreated adipocytes, GLUT4 recycles constitutively between the plasma membrane and intracellular loci (1Yang J. Holman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4600-4603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Satoh S. Nishimura H. Clark A.E. Kozka I.J. Vannucci S.J. Simpson I.A. Quon M.J. Cushman S.W. Holman G.D. J. Biol.

Morphological and biochemical studies have detected GLUT4 in distinct but inter-related intracellular pools, including sorting endosomes, TGN, recycling endosomes, and specialized GLUT4 exocytic vesicles (3Lee W.

To investigate the molecular mechanism of MIF action, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified PAG, a thiol-specific antioxidant protein, as an interacting partner of MIF. Association of MIF with PAG was found in 293T cells transiently expressing MIF and PAG. The use of PAG mutants (C52S, C71S, and C173S) revealed that this association was significantly affected by C173S, but not C52S and C71S, indicating that a disulfide involving Cys173 of PAG is responsible for the formation of MIF·PAG complex. In addition, the interaction was highly dependent on the reducing conditions such as dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol but not in the presence of H2O2. Analysis of the activities of the interacting proteins showed that the d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by coexpression of wild-type PAG, C52S, and C71S, whereas C173S was almost ineffective, suggesting that the direct interaction may be involved in the control ofd-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF. Moreover, MIF has been shown to bind to PAG and it also inhibits the antioxidant activity of PAG.

Structural studies of MIF have led to the suggestion that MIF bears a close architectural similarity to microbial enzymes such as 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate, 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, and chorismate mutase, even though these proteins share little homology in the amino acid sequence (9Chook Y.M.

On the other hand, based on the amino acid sequence homology and structural similarity of MIF withd-dopachrome tautomerase, which convertsd-dopachrome methyl ester to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxymethylester, a d-dopachrome tautomerase activity also has been proposed for MIF (13Rosengren E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance is currently unclear, because natural substrates of MIF have not yet been found. MIF was demonstrated to catalyze the keto-enol isomerization of bothp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, a hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase activity (15Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). More recently, MIF has been reported to possess a thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which involves the reduction of insulin and 2- hydroxyethyldisulfide.Several lines of evidence suggest that the intracellular redox regulation might be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, tumor promotion, and apoptosis (17Schreck R.

PAG, a known thiol-specific antioxidant, is a member of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) protein family, which was previously referred to as the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thiol-specific antioxidant family and is constitutively expressed in most human tissues, but its expression is higher in organs having a higher level of proliferation (19Prosperi M.-T.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Many Prx proteins are highly conserved in a wide variety of mammalian species such as human, mouse, and bovine, suggesting a biological importance of this type of enzyme (20Chae H.Z. Robison K.

Most Prx family members contain two conserved cysteines that correspond to Cys47 and Cys170 of yeast thioredoxin peroxidase. In yeast, both Cys47 and Cys170were shown to be necessary for the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, and Cys47, but not Cys170, was the primary site of oxidation by H2O2 (23Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar).Here we show that PAG binds specifically to MIF in vivo, and we found that this interaction is dependent on the redox status in that the interaction was significantly affected under reducing conditions. Binding of PAG to MIF can repress the d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF. Moreover, this binding resulted in the suppression of the antioxidant activity of PAG.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that MIF interacts with PAGin vivo, and that the MIF·PAG interaction is dependent on the redox status and the cysteine residues of PAG. In addition, we found that both d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF and antioxidant activity of PAG were negatively regulated by direct association of MIF with PAG.MIF has been proposed as an unusual cytokine containing a combined function both as a conventional cytokine and as an enzyme (1Bernhagen J.

Recently, several studies have reported a variety of enzymatic functions for MIF, including d-dopachrome tautomerase (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang M. Aman P. Grubb A. Panagopoulos I. Hindemith A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and a thiol protein oxidoreductase (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). d-dopachrome tautomerase was discovered during the study of melanin biosynthesis (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to have an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of MIF. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal proline of MIF is required for the d-dopachrome tautomerase and phenylpyruvate tautomerase activities (32Swope M. Sun H.W. Blake P.R. Lolis E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3534-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Stamps S.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10195-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, based on the observed sequence homology with known thiol-protein oxidoreductases (35Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that MIF may exhibit a cysteine-dependent enzymatic oxidoreductase activity and that this activity is dependent on the redox-active conserved sequence motif (Cys-X-X-Cys). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of MIF revealed that there was a conserved sequence motif consisting of Cys57-Ala-Leu-Cys60 that was found to be present in the catalytic center of thiol-protein oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin, protein disulfide isomerase, and glutaredoxin. Consistent with this fact, recently a critical role of the conserved cysteine sequence motif (Cys-X-X-Cys) in the oxidoreductase and macrophage-activating activities of MIF was reported (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The existence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge was also demonstrated from studies of the conserved cysteine sequence motif, even though previous studies had shown that neither recombinant E. coli-derived MIF nor native MIF from natural cell sources contained an intermolecular disulfide structure (7Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, MIF was crystallized as a trimer of three identical subunits (11Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Kato Y. Muto T. Tomura T. Tsumura H. Watarai H. Mikayama T. Ishizaka K. Kuroki R.

A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that MIF may heterodimerize with other cellular proteins in addition to its ability to homodimerize through disulfide linkages between cysteine residues, and that redox regulation may be also involved in the control of this association. To address this question, we sought to identify cellular target proteins that directly associate with MIF. In this study, we report isolation of PAG as an MIF-interacting protein. We performed the coprecipitation experiments of transiently expressed MIF and wild-type PAG, as well as PAG mutants, and demonstrated that MIF associates with wild-type PAG and PAG mutants tested, except for C173S, in mammalian cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that the conserved Cys173 of PAG plays a pivotal role in the formation of intermolecular disulfide linkages between MIF and PAG. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility that the other conserved Cys52 is also involved in the intermolecular disulfide linkages, because we are able to detect a significant decrease in the association of MIF with C52S, although to a somewhat lesser extent, by coprecipitation studies (Fig. 2). To gain more insight into the roles of cysteine residues in the MIF·PAG association, we examined the in vivo binding of MIF and PAG under various redox conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, upon reducing conditions the association was remarkably decreased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the in vivo association of MIF and PAG may be mediated through disulfide linkages of cysteine residues. Recent studies have suggested that MIF and thiol antioxidants could be bridged through inter-chain disulfides (24Jin D.-Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30952-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 37Jaschke A. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Swope M.D. Sun H.-W. Klockow B. Blake P. Lolis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14877-14884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is necessary to determine whether the conserved cysteine residues of PAG could influence homo- and heterodimerization and whether this complex formation contributes toward the regulation of functional activities of interacting partners.To understand how the interaction contributes to the activity of the respective proteins, the examination of how MIF or PAG binding modulates the interacting protein function seems to be important. As shown in this report, it can be concluded that PAG is a negative regulator of MIF activity. Moreover, we confirmed this observation with the PAG mutants such as C52S, C71S, and C173S. From these mutation experiments, all mutants, except for C173S, resulted in a decrease ofd-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These findings can be explained either by a physical binding of PAG to MIF or by an enzymatic function of PAG. However, the fact that C52S mutant, but not C173S, indeed decreases the MIF activity, together with our observation that both Cys52 and Cys173 are equally critical for the antioxidant activity of PAG (data not shown), does not favor the second model describing the importance of the enzymatic function of PAG in the regulation of MIF activity. In addition, it has recently been shown that several MIF residues near the N-terminal proline are perturbed upon addition ofS-hexylglutathione and affected byp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a substrate for the phenylpyruvate tautomerase activity of MIF (33Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Swope M.D. Sun H.-W. Klockow B. Blake P. Lolis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14877-14884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because our studies reported here demonstrated that PAG could inhibit the d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF, it is tempting to speculate that this effect is mediated through the perturbation of the residues surrounding the N-terminal proline on the three-dimensional structure of MIF by direct binding of PAG. Based on our observed results, we imagine that rather than direct contact with the residues surrounding the N-terminal proline, the conformational effect that is caused by intermolecular disulfide linkages between cysteine residues of PAG and MIF likely plays a role that is important in the regulation of MIFd-dopachrome tautomerase activity, probably by structural changes within the region near the N-terminal proline.A recent study (30Kleemann R. Mischke R. Kapurniotu A. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Aop1, a human thioredoxin peroxidase, and cyclophilin18 do not only interact physically, but binding of cyclophilin18 also stimulates the antioxidant activity of Aop1, suggesting an important role for the direct interaction in the regulation of the antioxidant activity of thioredoxin peroxidases. To test a possible influence of binding of MIF on the enzymatic activity of PAG, we used a similar approach. As shown in Fig. 5, a dramatic decrease was observed in the antioxidant activity of PAG when increasing amounts of MIF were added to the PAG. This also indicates that MIF negatively regulates the PAG activity. In this regard, the mechanism of interaction of MIF and PAG will be the interest of future study. Further understanding of the mechanism of this interaction will result from the identification of other interacting proteins associated with MIF or PAG and detailed analyses of the binding region in the MIF·PAG interaction. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)1 is a cytokine that plays an important role in the regulation of host immune and inflammatory response (1Bernhagen J. Calandra T. Bucala R. J. Mol.

MIF was demonstrated to catalyze the keto-enol isomerization of bothp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, a hydroxyphenylpyruvate tautomerase activity (15Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). More recently, MIF has been reported to possess a thiol-protein oxidoreductase activity (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), which involves the reduction of insulin and 2- hydroxyethyldisulfide. Several lines of evidence suggest that the intracellular redox regulation might be involved in a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, tumor promotion, and apoptosis (17Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3396) Google Scholar, 18Kalebic T. Kinter A. Poli G. Anderson M.E. Meister A. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Antioxidants govern the intracellular redox status. PAG, a known thiol-specific antioxidant, is a member of the peroxiredoxin (Prx) protein family, which was previously referred to as the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase/thiol-specific antioxidant family and is constitutively expressed in most human tissues, but its expression is higher in organs having a higher level of proliferation (19Prosperi M.-T.

Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7017-7021Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Many Prx proteins are highly conserved in a wide variety of mammalian species such as human, mouse, and bovine, suggesting a biological importance of this type of enzyme (20Chae H.Z. Robison K.

Most Prx family members contain two conserved cysteines that correspond to Cys47 and Cys170 of yeast thioredoxin peroxidase. In yeast, both Cys47 and Cys170were shown to be necessary for the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds, and Cys47, but not Cys170, was the primary site of oxidation by H2O2 (23Chae H.Z. Uhm T.B. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7022-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here we show that PAG binds specifically to MIF in vivo, and we found that this interaction is dependent on the redox status in that the interaction was significantly affected under reducing conditions. Binding of PAG to MIF can repress the d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF. Moreover, this binding resulted in the suppression of the antioxidant activity of PAG. DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates that MIF interacts with PAGin vivo, and that the MIF·PAG interaction is dependent on the redox status and the cysteine residues of PAG. In addition, we found that both d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF and antioxidant activity of PAG were negatively regulated by direct association of MIF with PAG.MIF has been proposed as an unusual cytokine containing a combined function both as a conventional cytokine and as an enzyme (1Bernhagen J.

Recently, several studies have reported a variety of enzymatic functions for MIF, including d-dopachrome tautomerase (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang M. Aman P. Grubb A. Panagopoulos I. Hindemith A. Rosengren E. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), phenylpyruvate tautomerase (15Rosengren E. Aman P. Thelin S. Hansson C. Ahlfors S. Bjork P. Jacobsson L. Rorsman H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and a thiol protein oxidoreductase (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). d-dopachrome tautomerase was discovered during the study of melanin biosynthesis (13Rosengren E. Bucala R. Arnan P. Jacobsson L. Odh G. Metz C.N. Rorsman H. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 143-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to have an amino acid sequence that is highly homologous with that of MIF. It has previously been shown that the N-terminal proline of MIF is required for the d-dopachrome tautomerase and phenylpyruvate tautomerase activities (32Swope M. Sun H.W. Blake P.R. Lolis E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3534-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 34Stamps S.L. Fitzgerald M.C. Whitman C.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10195-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, based on the observed sequence homology with known thiol-protein oxidoreductases (35Puig A. Lyles M.M. Noiva R. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19128-19135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is conceivable that MIF may exhibit a cysteine-dependent enzymatic oxidoreductase activity and that this activity is dependent on the redox-active conserved sequence motif (Cys-X-X-Cys). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of MIF revealed that there was a conserved sequence motif consisting of Cys57-Ala-Leu-Cys60 that was found to be present in the catalytic center of thiol-protein oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin, protein disulfide isomerase, and glutaredoxin. Consistent with this fact, recently a critical role of the conserved cysteine sequence motif (Cys-X-X-Cys) in the oxidoreductase and macrophage-activating activities of MIF was reported (16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The existence of an intramolecular disulfide bridge was also demonstrated from studies of the conserved cysteine sequence motif, even though previous studies had shown that neither recombinant E. coli-derived MIF nor native MIF from natural cell sources contained an intermolecular disulfide structure (7Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 16Kleemann R. Kapurniotu A. Frank R.W. Gessner A. Mischke R. Flieger O. Juttner S. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 85-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36Wistow G.J. Shaughnessy M.P. Lee D.C. Hodin J. Zelenka P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1272-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, MIF was crystallized as a trimer of three identical subunits (11Suzuki M. Sugimoto H. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. Sakai M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 28Kato Y. Muto T. Tomura T. Tsumura H. Watarai H. Mikayama T. Ishizaka K. Kuroki R.

A. 1996; 93: 5191-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that MIF may heterodimerize with other cellular proteins in addition to its ability to homodimerize through disulfide linkages between cysteine residues, and that redox regulation may be also involved in the control of this association. To address this question, we sought to identify cellular target proteins that directly associate with MIF. In this study, we report isolation of PAG as an MIF-interacting protein. We performed the coprecipitation experiments of transiently expressed MIF and wild-type PAG, as well as PAG mutants, and demonstrated that MIF associates with wild-type PAG and PAG mutants tested, except for C173S, in mammalian cells (Fig. 2), suggesting that the conserved Cys173 of PAG plays a pivotal role in the formation of intermolecular disulfide linkages between MIF and PAG. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility that the other conserved Cys52 is also involved in the intermolecular disulfide linkages, because we are able to detect a significant decrease in the association of MIF with C52S, although to a somewhat lesser extent, by coprecipitation studies (Fig. 2). To gain more insight into the roles of cysteine residues in the MIF·PAG association, we examined the in vivo binding of MIF and PAG under various redox conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, upon reducing conditions the association was remarkably decreased in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the in vivo association of MIF and PAG may be mediated through disulfide linkages of cysteine residues. Recent studies have suggested that MIF and thiol antioxidants could be bridged through inter-chain disulfides (24Jin D.-Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30952-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 37Jaschke A. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 763-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Swope M.D. Sun H.-W. Klockow B. Blake P. Lolis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14877-14884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is necessary to determine whether the conserved cysteine residues of PAG could influence homo- and heterodimerization and whether this complex formation contributes toward the regulation of functional activities of interacting partners.To understand how the interaction contributes to the activity of the respective proteins, the examination of how MIF or PAG binding modulates the interacting protein function seems to be important. As shown in this report, it can be concluded that PAG is a negative regulator of MIF activity. Moreover, we confirmed this observation with the PAG mutants such as C52S, C71S, and C173S. From these mutation experiments, all mutants, except for C173S, resulted in a decrease ofd-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF (Fig. 4 and data not shown). These findings can be explained either by a physical binding of PAG to MIF or by an enzymatic function of PAG. However, the fact that C52S mutant, but not C173S, indeed decreases the MIF activity, together with our observation that both Cys52 and Cys173 are equally critical for the antioxidant activity of PAG (data not shown), does not favor the second model describing the importance of the enzymatic function of PAG in the regulation of MIF activity. In addition, it has recently been shown that several MIF residues near the N-terminal proline are perturbed upon addition ofS-hexylglutathione and affected byp-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, a substrate for the phenylpyruvate tautomerase activity of MIF (33Lubetsky J.B. Swope M. Dealwis C. Blake P. Lolis E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7346-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Swope M.D. Sun H.-W. Klockow B. Blake P. Lolis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14877-14884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because our studies reported here demonstrated that PAG could inhibit the d-dopachrome tautomerase activity of MIF, it is tempting to speculate that this effect is mediated through the perturbation of the residues surrounding the N-terminal proline on the three-dimensional structure of MIF by direct binding of PAG. Based on our observed results, we imagine that rather than direct contact with the residues surrounding the N-terminal proline, the conformational effect that is caused by intermolecular disulfide linkages between cysteine residues of PAG and MIF likely plays a role that is important in the regulation of MIFd-dopachrome tautomerase activity, probably by structural changes within the region near the N-terminal proline.A recent study (30Kleemann R. Mischke R. Kapurniotu A. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Aop1, a human thioredoxin peroxidase, and cyclophilin18 do not only interact physically, but binding of cyclophilin18 also stimulates the antioxidant activity of Aop1, suggesting an important role for the direct interaction in the regulation of the antioxidant activity of thioredoxin peroxidases. To test a possible influence of binding of MIF on the enzymatic activity of PAG, we used a similar approach. As shown in Fig. 5, a dramatic decrease was observed in the antioxidant activity of PAG when increasing amounts of MIF were added to the PAG. This also indicates that MIF negatively regulates the PAG activity. In this regard, the mechanism of interaction of MIF and PAG will be the interest of future study. Further understanding of the mechanism of this interaction will result from the identification of other interacting proteins associated with MIF or PAG and detailed analyses of the binding region in the MIF·PAG interaction. The present study demonstrates that MIF interacts with PAGin vivo, and that the MIF·PAG interaction is dependent on the redox status and the cysteine residues of PAG.

https://openalex.org/W2008238416,"We have recently identified coactosin-like protein (CLP) in a yeast two-hybrid screen using 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) as a bait. In this report, we demonstrate a direct interaction between 5LO and CLP. 5LO associated with CLP, which was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, in a dose-dependent manner. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using epitope-tagged 5LO and CLP proteins transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells revealed the presence of CLP in 5LO immunoprecipitates. In reciprocal experiments, 5LO was detected in CLP immunoprecipitates. Non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and cross-linking experiments showed that 5LO binds CLP in a 1:1 molar stoichiometry in a Ca2+-independent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis suggested an important role for lysine 131 of CLP in mediating 5LO binding. In view of the ability of CLP to bind 5LO and filamentous actin (F-actin), we determined whether CLP could physically link 5LO to actin filaments. However, no F-actin-CLP·5LO ternary complex was observed. In contrast, 5LO appeared to compete with F-actin for the binding of CLP. Moreover, 5LO was found to interfere with actin polymerization. Our results indicate that the 5LO-CLP and CLP-F-actin interactions are mutually exclusive and suggest a modulatory role for 5LO in actin dynamics.

Our results indicate that the 5LO-CLP and CLP-F-actin interactions are mutually exclusive and suggest a modulatory role for 5LO in actin dynamics. 5-lipoxygenase bovine serum albumin coactosin-like protein 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride filamentous actin globular actin glutathioneS-transferase human embryonic kidney 293 cells leukotriene 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO)1 is of central importance in cellular leukotriene (LT) synthesis. This enzyme converts arachidonic acid released from the membranes by the cytosolic phospholipase A2 into 5(S)-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) and subsequently into the epoxide intermediate LTA4 (1Samuelsson B. Science. 1983; 220: 568-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar). LTA4 is further metabolized into LTB4 by the LTA4 hydrolase or into LTC4 through the action of the LTC4 synthase. LTC4 is then sequentially degraded into LTD4 and LTE4. Whereas LTB4 exerts potent stimulatory effects on various leukocyte functions, including chemotaxis, adhesion, degranulation, and aggregation, the cysteinyl-LTs (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are known to contract airway smooth muscle, increase vascular permeability, and promote mucus secretion (2Samuelsson B. Dahlén S.-E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). 5LO and LTs are, therefore, key components involved in inflammatory disorders, including arthritis, asthma, and allergic reactions.Recently, novel modulatory mechanisms determining cellular 5LO activity were identified. 5LO is phosphorylated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinases prepared from stimulated myeloid cells (3Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, Mg2+ increases 5LO activity in vitro (4Reddy K.V. Hammarberg T. Rådmark O. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1840-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a stimulatory Ca2+ binding site has been localized in the N-terminal domain of 5LO, that may function as a C2 domain in the calcium regulation of 5LO catalytic activity (5Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). C2 domains have also been shown to mediate protein-protein interactions (6Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar).Additional lines of evidence indicate that cellular 5LO activity and distribution is regulated by interaction with other proteins. For example, the subcellular distribution of 5LO differs among cell types and changes in response to various stimuli. In particular, 5LO translocates to the nuclear membrane from either the cytosol (for polymorphonuclear leukocytes) (7Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or from inside the nucleus (for alveolar macrophages) (8Woods J.W. Coffey M.J. Brock T.G. Singer I.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2035-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In that perspective, an association of 5LO with cytoskeletal structures in vivo, which is a reasonable possibility after demonstration of a direct association between 5LO and actin in vitro (9Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could have important implications for translocation and modulation of cellular 5LO activity.In our attempt to determine the protein partners of 5LO using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified coactosin-like protein (CLP) as a potential 5LO-interacting protein (10Provost P. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The CLP nucleotide sequence was initially found as a sequence flanking a deletion on chromosome 17 characterizing the Smith-Magenis syndrome (11Chen K.-S. Manian P. Koeuth T. Potocki L. Zhao Q. Chinault A.C. Lee C.C. Lupski J.R. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). In a separate paper, we have characterized CLP as a human filamentous actin (F-actin)-binding protein. 2P. Provost, J. Doucet, A. Stock, G. Gerisch, B. Samuelsson, and O. Rådmark, submitted for publication.2P. Provost, J. Doucet, A. Stock, G. Gerisch, B. Samuelsson, and O. Rådmark, submitted for publication. Here, we characterize the CLP-5LO interaction and investigate whether 5LO or the CLP-5LO tandem is recruited by F-actin.DISCUSSIONThe cellular activity and localization of 5LO may depend on its physical interaction with other proteins. To identify interacting proteins, we have used a two-hybrid approach (10Provost P. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1881-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). One of the proteins discovered by this approach, CLP, shows homology to coactosin, an actin binding protein from Dictyostelium discoideum (24de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Gerisch G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CLP has recently been characterized as a human F-actin-binding protein.2 In the present study, we show that 5LO interacts directly with CLP in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the interaction resulted in a heterodimeric complex. The formation of this complex proved to be independent of Ca2+, different from the membrane association of 5LO, which is promoted by Ca2+. We have recently shown that binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal domain of 5LO stimulates the activity of this enzyme (5Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Neither Ca2+-dependent activation nor the membrane association of 5LO seems to involve CLP. In fact, CLP has no direct effect on 5LO activity when purified proteins were mixed in vitro (data not shown).In a search for amino acid residues involved in the actin binding of CLP, we found one mutant, CLP K131A, with a strongly reduced capacity to interact with 5LO. The substitution of lysine 131 by arginine preserved 5LO binding, indicating the requirement of a basic, positively charged amino acid residue at position 131. The fact that the CLP K131A mutant retained its ability to bind actin indicates that its overall secondary structure was not drastically affected. In accord, the replacement of lysine 131 by alanine only slightly changed the circular dichroism spectrum. Lysine 131 thus appears to be part of the surface interacting with 5LO or to be required in particular for maintaining the conformation of CLP necessary for 5LO binding.The regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization and the localized assembly of filamentous actin into a network within the cortex of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are essential for generating the force necessary for leukocyte locomotion, shape change, phagocytosis, adhesion, and spreading (25Howard T.H. Watts R.G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1994; 1: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A connection between 5LO and actin, as reported previously (9Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is therefore of considerable interest. It raises the possibility that actin is involved in the intracellular translocation of 5LO, which concomitantly with LT biosynthesis follows activation of the cells (for review, see Ref. 27Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S36-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the activity of 5LO is influenced by the state of actin in vivo; an up-regulation of formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced leukotriene generation in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is observed when the cells were treated with cytochalasin B (28Ham E.A. Soderman D.D. Zanetti M.E. Dougherty H.W. McCauley E. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4349-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Haurand M. Flohé L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which interferes with actin filament formation. In turn, the catalytic products of 5LO appear to affect the actin system. For example, monohydroxy acids, including the 5LO derivate 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), are capable of binding cytosolic actin (30Kang L.-T. Vanderhoek J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LTB4induces oscillatory actin polymerization/depolymerization in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (31Omann G.M. Porasik M.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16355-16358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Omann G.M. Rengan R. Hoffman J.F. Linderman J.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5375-5381PubMed Google Scholar), and LTD4 triggers reorganization of the actin network in intestinal epithelial cells (33Massoumi R. Sjölander A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, leukotrienes have been implicated with the formation of stress fibers in endothelial cells subjected to mechanical stretching (34Wang J.H.-C. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Moldovan N. Yin F.C.-P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In our experiments, 5LO inhibited the polymerization of actin in vitro. This inhibitory effect was observed in both cosedimentation and actin polymerization assays. 5LO exerted this effect at submicromolar concentrations, in accord with the estimated concentration of monomeric actin (∼0.1–0.2 μm) in equilibrium with polymerized actin (35Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., NY1994Google Scholar, 36Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipurski S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. Scientific American Books, Inc., W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1995Google Scholar). These data are compatible with the possibility that 5LO inhibits actin polymerization by the sequestration of G-actin. On the other hand, the possibility remains that 5LO interferes with polymerization by the severing or capping of actin filaments, as for instance gelsolin does (37Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Lind S.E. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. Yin H.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3714-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In our actin polymerization and cosedimentation assays, which provide no evidence for the incorporation of a putative actin-5LO complex into actin, the binding of 5LO to one or the other end of actin filaments would have escaped detection. In fact, the finding that inhibition of actin polymerization by 5LO is not complete and saturates halfway (Fig.7 C), is most easily explained by assuming that 5LO caps the plus ends of actin filaments, thereby raising the critical concentration of G-actin.An indirect relationship of 5LO to the actin system is established by the binding of 5LO to CLP. The question has been addressed whether CLP, 5LO, and actin form a ternary complex. The mutational analysis of CLP indicated that lysine 131 is important for the binding of 5LO but not for the binding of actin. On the contrary, lysine 75 is critical for actin binding but not for the interaction with 5LO.2 Based on these data, the two binding sites on CLP appear to be distinct. However, they may be overlapping, or simultaneous binding of 5LO (78 kDa) and actin (42 kDa) to the small CLP molecule (16 kDa) may suffer from steric hindrance. Our attempts to identify a ternary complex of 5LO, CLP, and filamentous actin were unsuccessful. Rather, data suggest that 5LO prevents CLP from the interaction with actin. This is relevant since preliminary experiments suggest that CLP might antagonize the activity of gelsolin as a capper of the plus ends of actin-filaments (data not shown), a function reported for coactosin, which interfered with the actin-capping activity of fragment S1 of severin, a gelsolin-related protein in Dictyostelium (38Röhrig U. Gerisch G. Morozova L. Schleicher M. Wegner A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the presence of CLP and gelsolin, 5LO may restore the capping activity by sequestering CLP. Thus, one could speculate that 5LO may inhibit the polymerization of actin in two ways: by maintaining the activity of capping proteins in the presence of CLP and by acting itself as an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Considering the role of 5LO in vivo, the caveat has to be taken into account that modification of the proteins involved, such as phosphorylation (3Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 39Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), or the presence of cofactors may turn the inhibitory effect of 5LO into a supporting one.In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 5LO directly interacts with CLP. We also show that 5LO inhibits actin polymerization and interferes with the binding of CLP to F-actin. It may be hypothesized that 5LO, in addition to its key role in leukotriene synthesis, modulates the actin dynamics in inflammatory cells, thus representing a novel regulator of actin function. 5-Lipoxygenase (5LO)1 is of central importance in cellular leukotriene (LT) synthesis.

One of the proteins discovered by this approach, CLP, shows homology to coactosin, an actin binding protein from Dictyostelium discoideum (24de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Gerisch G. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 26: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CLP has recently been characterized as a human F-actin-binding protein.2 In the present study, we show that 5LO interacts directly with CLP in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the interaction resulted in a heterodimeric complex. The formation of this complex proved to be independent of Ca2+, different from the membrane association of 5LO, which is promoted by Ca2+. We have recently shown that binding of Ca2+ to the N-terminal domain of 5LO stimulates the activity of this enzyme (5Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Rådmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Neither Ca2+-dependent activation nor the membrane association of 5LO seems to involve CLP. In fact, CLP has no direct effect on 5LO activity when purified proteins were mixed in vitro (data not shown). In a search for amino acid residues involved in the actin binding of CLP, we found one mutant, CLP K131A, with a strongly reduced capacity to interact with 5LO. The substitution of lysine 131 by arginine preserved 5LO binding, indicating the requirement of a basic, positively charged amino acid residue at position 131. The fact that the CLP K131A mutant retained its ability to bind actin indicates that its overall secondary structure was not drastically affected. In accord, the replacement of lysine 131 by alanine only slightly changed the circular dichroism spectrum. Lysine 131 thus appears to be part of the surface interacting with 5LO or to be required in particular for maintaining the conformation of CLP necessary for 5LO binding. The regulation of actin polymerization and depolymerization and the localized assembly of filamentous actin into a network within the cortex of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are essential for generating the force necessary for leukocyte locomotion, shape change, phagocytosis, adhesion, and spreading (25Howard T.H. Watts R.G. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1994; 1: 61-68PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zigmond S.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A connection between 5LO and actin, as reported previously (9Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24163-24168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is therefore of considerable interest. It raises the possibility that actin is involved in the intracellular translocation of 5LO, which concomitantly with LT biosynthesis follows activation of the cells (for review, see Ref. 27Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S36-S40Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the activity of 5LO is influenced by the state of actin in vivo; an up-regulation of formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine-induced leukotriene generation in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is observed when the cells were treated with cytochalasin B (28Ham E.A. Soderman D.D. Zanetti M.E. Dougherty H.W. McCauley E. Kuehl Jr., F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4349-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 29Haurand M. Flohé L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2129-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which interferes with actin filament formation. In turn, the catalytic products of 5LO appear to affect the actin system. For example, monohydroxy acids, including the 5LO derivate 5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), are capable of binding cytosolic actin (30Kang L.-T. Vanderhoek J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1476-1482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LTB4induces oscillatory actin polymerization/depolymerization in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (31Omann G.M. Porasik M.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16355-16358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Omann G.M. Rengan R. Hoffman J.F. Linderman J.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5375-5381PubMed Google Scholar), and LTD4 triggers reorganization of the actin network in intestinal epithelial cells (33Massoumi R. Sjölander A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, leukotrienes have been implicated with the formation of stress fibers in endothelial cells subjected to mechanical stretching (34Wang J.H.-C. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Moldovan N. Yin F.C.-P. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In our experiments, 5LO inhibited the polymerization of actin in vitro. This inhibitory effect was observed in both cosedimentation and actin polymerization assays. 5LO exerted this effect at submicromolar concentrations, in accord with the estimated concentration of monomeric actin (∼0.1–0.2 μm) in equilibrium with polymerized actin (35Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J.D. Molecular Biology of the Cell. 3rd Ed. Garland Publishing, Inc., NY1994Google Scholar, 36Lodish H. Baltimore D. Berk A. Zipurski S.L. Matsudaira P. Darnell J. Molecular Cell Biology. 3rd Ed. Scientific American Books, Inc., W. H. Freeman and Co., NY1995Google Scholar). These data are compatible with the possibility that 5LO inhibits actin polymerization by the sequestration of G-actin. On the other hand, the possibility remains that 5LO interferes with polymerization by the severing or capping of actin filaments, as for instance gelsolin does (37Janmey P.A. Chaponnier C. Lind S.E. Zaner K.S. Stossel T.P. Yin H.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3714-3723Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In our actin polymerization and cosedimentation assays, which provide no evidence for the incorporation of a putative actin-5LO complex into actin, the binding of 5LO to one or the other end of actin filaments would have escaped detection. In fact, the finding that inhibition of actin polymerization by 5LO is not complete and saturates halfway (Fig.7 C), is most easily explained by assuming that 5LO caps the plus ends of actin filaments, thereby raising the critical concentration of G-actin. An indirect relationship of 5LO to the actin system is established by the binding of 5LO to CLP. The question has been addressed whether CLP, 5LO, and actin form a ternary complex. The mutational analysis of CLP indicated that lysine 131 is important for the binding of 5LO but not for the binding of actin. On the contrary, lysine 75 is critical for actin binding but not for the interaction with 5LO.2 Based on these data, the two binding sites on CLP appear to be distinct. However, they may be overlapping, or simultaneous binding of 5LO (78 kDa) and actin (42 kDa) to the small CLP molecule (16 kDa) may suffer from steric hindrance. Our attempts to identify a ternary complex of 5LO, CLP, and filamentous actin were unsuccessful. Rather, data suggest that 5LO prevents CLP from the interaction with actin. This is relevant since preliminary experiments suggest that CLP might antagonize the activity of gelsolin as a capper of the plus ends of actin-filaments (data not shown), a function reported for coactosin, which interfered with the actin-capping activity of fragment S1 of severin, a gelsolin-related protein in Dictyostelium (38Röhrig U. Gerisch G. Morozova L. Schleicher M. Wegner A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the presence of CLP and gelsolin, 5LO may restore the capping activity by sequestering CLP. Thus, one could speculate that 5LO may inhibit the polymerization of actin in two ways: by maintaining the activity of capping proteins in the presence of CLP and by acting itself as an inhibitor of actin polymerization. Considering the role of 5LO in vivo, the caveat has to be taken into account that modification of the proteins involved, such as phosphorylation (3Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Rådmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 39Lepley R.A. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), or the presence of cofactors may turn the inhibitory effect of 5LO into a supporting one. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that 5LO directly interacts with CLP. We also show that 5LO inhibits actin polymerization and interferes with the binding of CLP to F-actin. It may be hypothesized that 5LO, in addition to its key role in leukotriene synthesis, modulates the actin dynamics in inflammatory cells, thus representing a novel regulator of actin function.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear. Using recombinant adenoviruses that express the preproinsulin mRNA with defined alterations, the untranslated regions (UTRs) of the preproinsulin mRNA were examined for elements that specifically control translation of the mRNA in rat pancreatic islets. These studies revealed that the preproinsulin 5′-UTR was necessary for glucose stimulation of preproinsulin mRNA translation, whereas the 3′-UTR appeared to suppress translation. However, together the 5′- and 3′-UTRs acted cooperatively to markedly increase glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis. In primary hepatocytes the presence of the preproinsulin 3′-UTR led to reduced mRNA levels compared with the presence of the SV40 3′-UTR, consistent with the presence of mRNA stability determinants in the 3′-UTR that stabilize the preproinsulin mRNA in a pancreatic β-cell-specific manner. Translation of these mRNAs in primary hepatocytes was not stimulated by glucose, indicating that regulated translation of the preproinsulin mRNA occurs in a pancreatic β-cell-specific manner.

LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). To replenish secreted insulin and maintain optimal intracellular insulin stores there is a corresponding rapid and specific stimulation of proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Under normal circumstances this occurs by increasing translation of the existing preproinsulin mRNA and is mostly controlled at the initiation phase of the translational mechanism. Preproinsulin mRNA is mobilized from an inert intracellular storage pool (in which most of the mRNA is free) to membrane-bound polyribosomes, marking the entry of newly synthesized proinsulin into the β-cell secretory pathway (4Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Translation of the preproinsulin mRNA is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum through an interaction between its signal peptide and the signal recognition particle (SRP).1 It has been reported that SRP-mediated translocation of secretory pathway mRNAs to the endoplasmic reticulum is glucose-regulated in pancreatic β-cells (6Welsh N. Oberg C. Welsh M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Glucose stimulates general protein synthesis in the β-cell approximately 2-fold (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Grimaldi K.A. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 245: 567-573Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Alarcon C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through an increase in the activity of the general translation machinery, largely through protein phosphorylation regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) activity (10Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In β-cells, glucose stimulation of general translation has been shown to occur through the regulation of the activity of two basal translation factors, eIF-2B and PHAS-1/eIF-4E-BP (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Xu G.

However, glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis can increase as much as 30-fold in 1 h, implying a specific control mechanism above the general effect of glucose on total protein synthesis. We reveal in this study that such specific translational regulation of preproinsulin mRNA lies within the molecule itself.Specific translational regulation of individual mRNAs can involve elements within their untranslated regions (UTRs). For example, the translation of the ferritin mRNA is regulated by intracellular iron levels acting through an element in the 5′-UTR (13Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 655-670Google Scholar), known as an iron response element, that includes a cis-acting stem-loop secondary structure (dG = −15.4 kcal/mole). This element up-regulates ferritin mRNA translation in response to increased cellular iron through an interaction with a trans-acting iron-binding protein. Iron response elements are evolutionarily conserved in ferritin H chain mRNAs from several mammalian species. Intriguingly, the preproinsulin mRNA also has evolutionarily conserved features. RNA structural analysis of the rat preproinsulin II mRNA predicts the presence of a stem-loop structure in the 5′-UTR (dG = −10.8 kcal/mole) that closely resembles structures predicted to form in the 5′-UTR of other mammalian preproinsulin mRNAs (14Knight S.W. Docherty K. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 225-234Google Scholar, 15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar). By comparative analysis of mammalian preproinsulin mRNA sequences we have also found the presence of a highly conserved 12-bp element within the 3′-UTR (Fig.1) that lies between the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) and the polyadenylation site. Elements within the 3′-UTR of other mRNAs have been shown to be necessary for the regulation of mRNA localization, translation, polyadenylation, and stability (16Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a role for the untranslated regions of the preproinsulin mRNA in regulating its specific translation in response to glucose, which has been directly tested in this study.DISCUSSIONPreproinsulin mRNA was one of the first mRNAs found to be specifically regulated at the translational level (4Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, over the subsequent 20 years the mechanism of this regulation has remained unknown. There are generic effects of glucose on up-regulating total protein synthesis in pancreatic islet β-cells, which in turn have a modest effect of increasing proinsulin synthesis. Glucose stimulates increases in general protein synthesis in pancreatic islet β-cells, most likely by the phosphorylation of certain general translation initiation factors (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I.

Moreover, there is an additional general control mechanism applied to newly synthesized proteins destined for the β-cell secretory pathway, mediated via the nascent signal peptide, most likely through the signal peptide/SRP interaction and alleviation of SRP-mediated arrest of translation (5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Webb G.C. Murtaza S.A. Zhoa C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both of these general mechanisms contribute to the up-regulation of proinsulin synthesis but are relatively minor and do not account for the specific nature of glucose-induced preproinsulin mRNA translation.In this study, using a recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of a His-tagged proinsulin reporter in isolated rat islets, we have revealed that the specific translational regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose was largely dependent upon elements that lie in the untranslated regions of preproinsulin mRNA. The 5′-UTR of preproinsulin mRNA encoded an element, most likely residing in a conserved stem-loop secondary structure (14Knight S.W. Docherty K. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 225-234Google Scholar, 15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar), that was necessary for the specific stimulation of proinsulin biosynthesis translation in response to glucose. The 3′-UTR of preproinsulin mRNA contained an element, most likely the conserved UUGAA sequence (Fig. 1), that had a tendency to suppress glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis but also to stabilize the preproinsulin mRNA in a pancreatic islet β-cell-specific manner. When expressed together, the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA acted synergistically to markedly stimulate the His-tagged proinsulin biosynthesis translation in a manner reminiscent of the endogenous proinsulin (Fig. 5). The finding of a cooperativity between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA for translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis complements recent findings with the basal translational machinery that show an interaction between the cap binding complex subunit, eIF-4G, and the poly(A)-binding protein, PABP (24Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 447-466Google Scholar). Based on the findings in this study, we propose a model for the translation of the preproinsulin mRNA, illustrated in Fig. 8. Firstly, there are two generic effects; one is an effect of glucose on the β-cell translational machinery, mostly at the initiation phase (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,12Xu G. Marshall A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence J.C. McDaniel M.L J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), resulting in an ∼2-fold increase in total protein synthesis. The other is directed at a nascent signal peptide/SRP interaction (5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Welsh N. Oberg C. Welsh M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is probably adaptive to an up-regulation in biosynthesis of proteins destined for the pancreatic β-cell secretory pathway, of which proinsulin is included. However, the major specific translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose is via the UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA. As the glucose concentration rises above 3 mm glucose, the 5′-UTR promotes a marked increase in translation of preproinsulin mRNA, and simultaneously there is an alleviation of suppressing preproinsulin mRNA translation mediated at the 3′-UTR, probably via an interaction with the 5′-UTR. Sequences in the 3′-UTR also specifically increase preproinsulin mRNA stability in β-cells, which will also contribute proinsulin biosynthesis at the translational level by preserving the amount of available preproinsulin mRNA template. Thus, there are multiple points for specific regulation of preproinsulin mRNA translation that, when operating coordinately, account for the fine control of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose in pancreatic islet β-cells. It is likely that elements within the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA will interact with trans-acting factors, probably proteins, to confer their effects in glucose-regulated proinsulin biosynthesis translation and/or preproinsulin mRNA stability. Suchtrans-acting factors, and/or their regulation, are likely to be specific to the pancreatic β-cell, because the preproinsulin mRNA UTRs could not confer specific glucose-regulated translation of the preproinsulin mRNA in hepatocytes. Because glucose metabolism is required for glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar), one would predict that trans-acting factors should associate with the elements in the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the preproinsulin mRNA in a manner that responds to secondary signals that arise from glucose metabolism and that these interactions should up-regulate preproinsulin mRNA translation. Future experimentation will be directed to identify such β-cell-specific preproinsulin mRNA-regulating trans-acting factors.Figure 8A model for the translational regulation of the preproinsulin mRNA in response to glucose. Translation of the preproinsulin mRNA is regulated by glucose acting through general mechanisms (general translational factors and secretory pathway) and by specific mechanisms that require sequences in both the 5′- and 3′-UTRs. 4F refers to the cap binding complex, eIF-4F. sig indicates the signal peptide encoded by the preproinsulin mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The untranslated regions of mammalian preproinsulin mRNAs contain conserved features that may be necessary for the regulation of proinsulin translation. Previous studies have shown that the translation of ∼50 proteins in β-cells is stimulated greater than 10-fold in response to glucose (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a predicted stem-loop secondary structure in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA encoding two of these proteins, the prohormone convertases, PC2 and PC3, revealed a similar structure to that predicted to form in the 5′-UTR of the preproinsulin mRNA. It is likely that this secondary structure is involved in glucose-induced translational regulation of proPC2 and proPC3 biosynthesis in β-cells parallel to that of proinsulin (9Alarcon C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J.

However, preproPC2 and preproPC3 mRNAs lack the conserved UUGAA element in the 3′-UTR that may explain their less robust translational response to glucose (15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar), as well as a shorter mRNA half-life relative to preproinsulin mRNA (25Schppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 313: 259-268Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, it is quite likely that certain aspects of the mechanism for glucose-induced translation control of proinsulin biosynthesis unveiled in this study also apply to controlling the biosynthesis of other proteins destined for the insulin secretory granule compartment, particularly those that catalyze proinsulin sorting, processing, and regulated secretion (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mechanisms that underlie nutrient-induced translational regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis are likely to be crucial in understanding wider aspects of β-cell physiology and metabolic homeostasis, because this is the major control of insulin production in mammals under normal physiological conditions (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Clarke A. FASEB. J. 1994; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is disregulation of proinsulin biosynthesis in an animal model of type II diabetes, which contributes to β-cell dysfunction and decreased availability of insulin (26Alarcon C. Leahy J.L. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, it is quite likely that the translational control mechanism for glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis in pancreatic β-cells may serve as a model for tightly regulating production of the major polypeptide product in other neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells that produce a primary polypeptide product and store it intracellularly in secretory vesicles will have that store depleted by secretion of the polypeptide in response to an extracellular stimulus. Translational regulation of pre-existing mRNA of a polypeptide hormone/neurotransmitter by the same stimulus provides a means to rapidly and economically replenish intracellular stores lost by exocytosis and maintain them at optimal levels, as such preserving efficient secretory function of the neuroendocrine cell. Pancreatic islet β-cells secrete insulin in response to increases in circulating nutrients, the most physiologically relevant of which is glucose (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar). To replenish secreted insulin and maintain optimal intracellular insulin stores there is a corresponding rapid and specific stimulation of proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Under normal circumstances this occurs by increasing translation of the existing preproinsulin mRNA and is mostly controlled at the initiation phase of the translational mechanism. Preproinsulin mRNA is mobilized from an inert intracellular storage pool (in which most of the mRNA is free) to membrane-bound polyribosomes, marking the entry of newly synthesized proinsulin into the β-cell secretory pathway (4Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Translation of the preproinsulin mRNA is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum through an interaction between its signal peptide and the signal recognition particle (SRP).1 It has been reported that SRP-mediated translocation of secretory pathway mRNAs to the endoplasmic reticulum is glucose-regulated in pancreatic β-cells (6Welsh N. Oberg C. Welsh M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar,7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glucose stimulates general protein synthesis in the β-cell approximately 2-fold (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 8Grimaldi K.A. Siddle K. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 245: 567-573Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 9Alarcon C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This occurs through an increase in the activity of the general translation machinery, largely through protein phosphorylation regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) activity (10Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30337-30340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In β-cells, glucose stimulation of general translation has been shown to occur through the regulation of the activity of two basal translation factors, eIF-2B and PHAS-1/eIF-4E-BP (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Xu G.

However, glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis can increase as much as 30-fold in 1 h, implying a specific control mechanism above the general effect of glucose on total protein synthesis. We reveal in this study that such specific translational regulation of preproinsulin mRNA lies within the molecule itself. Specific translational regulation of individual mRNAs can involve elements within their untranslated regions (UTRs). For example, the translation of the ferritin mRNA is regulated by intracellular iron levels acting through an element in the 5′-UTR (13Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 655-670Google Scholar), known as an iron response element, that includes a cis-acting stem-loop secondary structure (dG = −15.4 kcal/mole). This element up-regulates ferritin mRNA translation in response to increased cellular iron through an interaction with a trans-acting iron-binding protein. Iron response elements are evolutionarily conserved in ferritin H chain mRNAs from several mammalian species. Intriguingly, the preproinsulin mRNA also has evolutionarily conserved features. RNA structural analysis of the rat preproinsulin II mRNA predicts the presence of a stem-loop structure in the 5′-UTR (dG = −10.8 kcal/mole) that closely resembles structures predicted to form in the 5′-UTR of other mammalian preproinsulin mRNAs (14Knight S.W. Docherty K. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 225-234Google Scholar, 15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar). By comparative analysis of mammalian preproinsulin mRNA sequences we have also found the presence of a highly conserved 12-bp element within the 3′-UTR (Fig.1) that lies between the polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) and the polyadenylation site. Elements within the 3′-UTR of other mRNAs have been shown to be necessary for the regulation of mRNA localization, translation, polyadenylation, and stability (16Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a role for the untranslated regions of the preproinsulin mRNA in regulating its specific translation in response to glucose, which has been directly tested in this study. DISCUSSIONPreproinsulin mRNA was one of the first mRNAs found to be specifically regulated at the translational level (4Itoh N. Okamoto H. Nature. 1980; 283: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). However, over the subsequent 20 years the mechanism of this regulation has remained unknown. There are generic effects of glucose on up-regulating total protein synthesis in pancreatic islet β-cells, which in turn have a modest effect of increasing proinsulin synthesis. Glucose stimulates increases in general protein synthesis in pancreatic islet β-cells, most likely by the phosphorylation of certain general translation initiation factors (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I.

Moreover, there is an additional general control mechanism applied to newly synthesized proteins destined for the β-cell secretory pathway, mediated via the nascent signal peptide, most likely through the signal peptide/SRP interaction and alleviation of SRP-mediated arrest of translation (5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Webb G.C. Murtaza S.A. Zhoa C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5773-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both of these general mechanisms contribute to the up-regulation of proinsulin synthesis but are relatively minor and do not account for the specific nature of glucose-induced preproinsulin mRNA translation.In this study, using a recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of a His-tagged proinsulin reporter in isolated rat islets, we have revealed that the specific translational regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose was largely dependent upon elements that lie in the untranslated regions of preproinsulin mRNA. The 5′-UTR of preproinsulin mRNA encoded an element, most likely residing in a conserved stem-loop secondary structure (14Knight S.W. Docherty K. J. Endocrinol. 1992; 8: 225-234Google Scholar, 15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar), that was necessary for the specific stimulation of proinsulin biosynthesis translation in response to glucose. The 3′-UTR of preproinsulin mRNA contained an element, most likely the conserved UUGAA sequence (Fig. 1), that had a tendency to suppress glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis but also to stabilize the preproinsulin mRNA in a pancreatic islet β-cell-specific manner. When expressed together, the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA acted synergistically to markedly stimulate the His-tagged proinsulin biosynthesis translation in a manner reminiscent of the endogenous proinsulin (Fig. 5). The finding of a cooperativity between the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA for translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis complements recent findings with the basal translational machinery that show an interaction between the cap binding complex subunit, eIF-4G, and the poly(A)-binding protein, PABP (24Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 447-466Google Scholar). Based on the findings in this study, we propose a model for the translation of the preproinsulin mRNA, illustrated in Fig. 8. Firstly, there are two generic effects; one is an effect of glucose on the β-cell translational machinery, mostly at the initiation phase (11Gilligan M. Welsh G.I. Flynn A. Bujalska I. Diggle T.A. Denton R.M. Proud C.G. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2121-2125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,12Xu G. Marshall A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence J.C. McDaniel M.L J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), resulting in an ∼2-fold increase in total protein synthesis. The other is directed at a nascent signal peptide/SRP interaction (5Welsh M. Scherberg N. Gilmore R. Steiner D.F. Biochem. J. 1986; 235: 454-467Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 6Welsh N. Oberg C. Welsh M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is probably adaptive to an up-regulation in biosynthesis of proteins destined for the pancreatic β-cell secretory pathway, of which proinsulin is included. However, the major specific translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose is via the UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA. As the glucose concentration rises above 3 mm glucose, the 5′-UTR promotes a marked increase in translation of preproinsulin mRNA, and simultaneously there is an alleviation of suppressing preproinsulin mRNA translation mediated at the 3′-UTR, probably via an interaction with the 5′-UTR. Sequences in the 3′-UTR also specifically increase preproinsulin mRNA stability in β-cells, which will also contribute proinsulin biosynthesis at the translational level by preserving the amount of available preproinsulin mRNA template. Thus, there are multiple points for specific regulation of preproinsulin mRNA translation that, when operating coordinately, account for the fine control of proinsulin biosynthesis by glucose in pancreatic islet β-cells. It is likely that elements within the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of preproinsulin mRNA will interact with trans-acting factors, probably proteins, to confer their effects in glucose-regulated proinsulin biosynthesis translation and/or preproinsulin mRNA stability. Suchtrans-acting factors, and/or their regulation, are likely to be specific to the pancreatic β-cell, because the preproinsulin mRNA UTRs could not confer specific glucose-regulated translation of the preproinsulin mRNA in hepatocytes. Because glucose metabolism is required for glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar), one would predict that trans-acting factors should associate with the elements in the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of the preproinsulin mRNA in a manner that responds to secondary signals that arise from glucose metabolism and that these interactions should up-regulate preproinsulin mRNA translation. Future experimentation will be directed to identify such β-cell-specific preproinsulin mRNA-regulating trans-acting factors.The untranslated regions of mammalian preproinsulin mRNAs contain conserved features that may be necessary for the regulation of proinsulin translation. Previous studies have shown that the translation of ∼50 proteins in β-cells is stimulated greater than 10-fold in response to glucose (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a predicted stem-loop secondary structure in the 5′-UTR of the mRNA encoding two of these proteins, the prohormone convertases, PC2 and PC3, revealed a similar structure to that predicted to form in the 5′-UTR of the preproinsulin mRNA. It is likely that this secondary structure is involved in glucose-induced translational regulation of proPC2 and proPC3 biosynthesis in β-cells parallel to that of proinsulin (9Alarcon C. Lincoln B. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Skelly R.H. Schuppin G.T. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Rhodes C.J.

However, preproPC2 and preproPC3 mRNAs lack the conserved UUGAA element in the 3′-UTR that may explain their less robust translational response to glucose (15Herbert T.P. Alarcon C. Skelly R.H. Bollheimer L.C. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Hook V.Y.H. Proteolytic and Cellular Mechanisms in Prohormone and Proprotein Processing. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1998: 105-120Google Scholar), as well as a shorter mRNA half-life relative to preproinsulin mRNA (25Schppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 313: 259-268Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, it is quite likely that certain aspects of the mechanism for glucose-induced translation control of proinsulin biosynthesis unveiled in this study also apply to controlling the biosynthesis of other proteins destined for the insulin secretory granule compartment, particularly those that catalyze proinsulin sorting, processing, and regulated secretion (7Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mechanisms that underlie nutrient-induced translational regulation of proinsulin biosynthesis are likely to be crucial in understanding wider aspects of β-cell physiology and metabolic homeostasis, because this is the major control of insulin production in mammals under normal physiological conditions (1Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philidelphia, PA2000: 20-37Google Scholar, 2Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Clarke A. FASEB. J. 1994; 8: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, there is disregulation of proinsulin biosynthesis in an animal model of type II diabetes, which contributes to β-cell dysfunction and decreased availability of insulin (26Alarcon C. Leahy J.L. Schuppin G.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, it is quite likely that the translational control mechanism for glucose-stimulated proinsulin biosynthesis in pancreatic β-cells may serve as a model for tightly regulating production of the major polypeptide product in other neuroendocrine cells. Neuroendocrine cells that produce a primary polypeptide product and store it intracellularly in secretory vesicles will have that store depleted by secretion of the polypeptide in response to an extracellular stimulus.

https://openalex.org/W2054559146,"Six amino acid locations in the soluble castor Δ9-18:0-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturase were identified that can affect substrate specificity. Combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of these six amino acids, in conjunction with selection, using an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph system, led to the isolation of variants with up to 15-fold increased specific activity toward 16-carbon substrates. The most improved mutant, com2, contained two substitutions (T117R/G188L) common to five of the 19 complementing variants subjected to further analysis. These changes, when engineered into otherwise wild-type 18:0-ACP desaturase to make mutant 5.2, produced a 35-fold increase in specific activity with respect to 16-carbon substrates. Kinetic analysis revealed changes in both k cat and K m that result in an 82-fold improvement in specificity factor for 16-carbon substrate compared with wild-type enzyme. Improved substrate orientation apparently compensated for loss of binding energy that results from the loss of desolvation energy for 16-carbon substrates. Mutant 5.2 had specific activity for 16-carbon substrates 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of known natural 16-carbon specific desaturases. These data support the hypothesis that it should be possible to reengineer archetypal enzymes to achieve substrate specificities characteristic of recently evolved enzymes while retaining the desired stability and/or turnover characteristics of a parental paralog. Six amino acid locations in the soluble castor Δ9-18:0-acyl carrier protein (ACP) desaturase were identified that can affect substrate specificity. Combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of these six amino acids, in conjunction with selection, using an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph system, led to the isolation of variants with up to 15-fold increased specific activity toward 16-carbon substrates. The most improved mutant, com2, contained two substitutions (T117R/G188L) common to five of the 19 complementing variants subjected to further analysis. These changes, when engineered into otherwise wild-type 18:0-ACP desaturase to make mutant 5.2, produced a 35-fold increase in specific activity with respect to 16-carbon substrates. Kinetic analysis revealed changes in both k cat and K m that result in an 82-fold improvement in specificity factor for 16-carbon substrate compared with wild-type enzyme. Improved substrate orientation apparently compensated for loss of binding energy that results from the loss of desolvation energy for 16-carbon substrates. Mutant 5.2 had specific activity for 16-carbon substrates 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of known natural 16-carbon specific desaturases. These data support the hypothesis that it should be possible to reengineer archetypal enzymes to achieve substrate specificities characteristic of recently evolved enzymes while retaining the desired stability and/or turnover characteristics of a parental paralog. acyl carrier protein wild-type polymerase chain reaction Plant-soluble fatty acid desaturase enzymes introduce a double bond regiospecifically into a saturated acyl-ACP substrate. The reaction involves activation of molecular oxygen by a two-electron reduced diiron center coordinated by a four-helix bundle that forms the core of the desaturase architecture (1Broadwater J.A. Fox B.G. Fett. Lipid. 1998; 100: 103-113Crossref Google Scholar, 2Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant. Mol. biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). The archetype of this class is the Δ9-18:01-ACP desaturase required by all plants for the maintenance of membrane fluidity (2Shanklin J. Cahoon E.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant. Mol. biol. 1998; 49: 611-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 3Shanklin J. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2510-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While this enzyme primarily desaturates stearoyl-ACP, it is also active to a minor extent with palmitoyl-ACP (4McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12141-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S. Shanklin J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the native desaturase revealed a pocket capable of accommodating an 18-carbon substrate in the extended conformation adjacent to the diiron active site (6Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). While a pocket capable of binding 18-carbon substrates could also structurally accommodate 16- and 14-carbon substrates, reduced turnover with 16- and 14-carbon substrates has been correlated with a loss of binding energy corresponding to the desolvation of two or four fewer methylene groups (7Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12833-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several naturally occurring variant desaturase enzymes have been isolated from tissues that accumulate unusual fatty acids based on their homology to the archetype 18:0-ACP2 desaturases (5Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S. Shanklin J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,8Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Ohlrogge J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The specific activity profiles of these enzymes are consistent with a role of producing the corresponding unusual fatty acids. However, they exhibit very poor specific activities compared with all stearoyl-ACP desaturases reported to date and have proved ineffective in producing altered fatty acid phenotypes when heterologously expressed (Ref. 12Cahoon E.B. Dormann P. Ohlrogge J.B. Prog. Lipid Res. 1994; 33: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and data not shown). Recent observations from the Ohlrogge group suggests that vegetative ferredoxins, 3All specific activities compared in this report were determined using Anabaena vegetative ferredoxin. and specific ACP isoforms may be required for optimal activity of the variant desaturases (13Suh M.C. Schultz D.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant J. 1999; 17: 679-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Schultz D.J. Suh M.C. Ohlrogge J.B. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition to showing poor activities, variant desaturases tended to form insoluble aggregates when purified. Low stability and poor catalytic rates are properties shared by many newly evolved enzymes that arise as gene duplication events in which selection for stability and/or turnover is released, while mutations accumulate that finally result in an alteration of function (15Govindarajan S. Goldstein R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Goldstein R.A. Broglia R.A. Shakhnovich E.I. Tiana G. Protein Folding, Evolution and Design. CXLIV. I.O.S. Press, Amsterdam2001Google Scholar). A prediction of this model is that it should be possible to redesign archetypal enzymes that exhibit desired stability and/or turnover to achieve an altered substrate specificity while retaining the desired properties of the parental paralog. Bacterial unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophs have been used for the isolation and characterization of both membrane-bound and soluble fatty acid desaturase systems (17Aguilar P.S. Cronan Jr., J.E. de Mendoza D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cahoon E.B. Mills L.A. Shanklin J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 936-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We recently described a bacterial selection system capable of distinguishing between soluble desaturase enzymes with different chain length specificities (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Soluble desaturases specific for 18-carbon chain length are unable to complement MH13, an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph of Escherichia coli defective in the anaerobic dehydratase/isomerase pathway of double bond incorporation into fatty acids, presumably due to the lack of available 18:0-ACP substrate. However, desaturase variants capable of recognizing substrates of 16- or 14-carbon chain length are able to complement the unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophy. To test the selection system, we identified four amino acid positions at the base of the substrate-binding cavity (114, 4Amino acid numbering corresponds to the sequence of the mature castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase (6Lindqvist Y. Huang W. Schneider G. Shanklin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4081-4092Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). 118, 179, and 188) and constructed libraries of mutants saturated for substitutions at each of the locations individually. Variants best able to complement the unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophy were isolated and characterized. The resulting enzymes, like those derived from rational design efforts, showed relatively poor specific activity compared with the wt enzyme with its preferred substrate, 18:0-ACP (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Cahoon E.B. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4872-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the observation that hydrophobic partitioning plays a substantial role in the selectivity and reaction rate for the wt castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase (7Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12833-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This conclusion, along with the results of our previous efforts in producing enzymes with desired specificity but poor turnover rates, suggested that this physico-chemical parameter might place an upper boundary to the reaction rate of desaturase with the desired 16-carbon substrate and that it might not be possible to engineer a 16:0-Δ9-desaturase with catalytic properties similar to those of the wt enzyme with its preferred substrate. However, small changes in relative positioning of substrate relative to the active site have been shown to exert large effects on catalytic rates (21Cannon W.R. Singleton S.F. Benkovic S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Whitty A. Fierke C.A. Jencks W.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11678-11689Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore used combinatorial saturation mutagenesis at positions known to affect substrate specificity to maximize the likelihood of identifying variants with desired improvement in turnover rates. These combinatorial genetic experiments led to the identification of two key substitutions (T117R/G188L) that when made alone in the wt castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase background yielded a Δ9-16:0-ACP desaturase with a turnover rate approaching that of wt enzyme with 18:0-ACP. This improvement resulted from an increase in k cat and decrease inK m that yielded an improvement in specificity factor for 16-carbon substrate of 82-fold with respect to wt enzyme. The portion of the castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase corresponding to the mature polypeptide was excised from the clone pRCD1 (3Shanklin J. Somerville C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2510-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) with the use ofEcoRI and XbaI. The 1683-base pair fragment was subject to partial digestion with DNase I (Sigma) and the resulting fragments separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments ranging in size between 100 and 250 base pairs were excised and subjected to primerless PCR to facilitate assembly of the full-sized gene along with the incorporating point mutations (23Stemmer W.P. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). The authentic sized product was excised from an agarose gel and amplified by PCR using primers: 5′-CACACAGTCTAGAAATAATTTTGTTTAACTTTAAGAAGGA-3′ (Primer A) and 5′-GTCTTCAAGAATTCTCATGTTTGACAGCTTATCATCG-3′ (Primer B). The amplified fragment was restricted with XbaI andEcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pLac3. The resulting library of mutants was transformed into E. coli MH13/pAnFd and the cells challenged to growth in the absence of unsaturated fatty acids. Saturation mutagenesis was performed at codons for amino acids 117 and 181 of the castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase by replacing the target codon by NNN with the use of overlap-extension PCR (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar) as described previously (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mature castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase was used as the template, and amplification reactions were conducted with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Saturating mutations were introduced at the codon for amino acid 117 by initially conducting two separate amplification reactions using the following oligonucleotide primer combinations: Reaction 1-Primer A and 5′-CCAAATTGCCCAAGACGTCGGACTTGCACCTGTTTCATCCCGAACTCCATCCAANNNATTCAGCATTGTTTG-3′ (Primer C) and Reaction 2–R5′-GAAACAGGTGCAAGTCCGACGTCTTGGGCAA-3′ (Primer D) and 5′GTTTTCTGTCCGCGGATCCATTCCTG3′ (Primer E). Agarose gel-purified reaction products were combined and amplified together with primer A and Primer E. The resulting product was digested withXbaI and SacII and ligated in place of the corresponding portion of the coding sequence for the mature wild-type castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase in pLac3d. Saturation mutagenesis at codon 181 was achieved by amplification of the castor desaturase with: 5′-GGTTCAGGAATGATCCGCGGNNNGAAAAGAGTCCATACC-3′ (Primer F) and 5′-GCAAAAGCCAAAACGGTACCATCAGGATCA-3′ (Primer G). The resulting fragment was restricted with BamHI and Acc65I and cloned into the corresponding portion of the coding sequence for the mature wild-type castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase in pLac3d. Overlap extension PCR was used to construct a library in which combinations of one of 20 possible amino acids were expressed at each of six positions (114, 117, 118, 179, 181, and 188) of the castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase simultaneously. The codon NNK(G/T) was introduced at each of these targeted positions, because it has 32-fold degeneracy rather than the 64-fold degeneracy of NNN, and it encodes all 20 amino acids without rare codons. Three independent PCR amplification reactions of the wild-type castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase were performed using the following oligonucleotide primer combinations: Reaction 1-Primer A and 5′-TTGATAAGTGGGAAGGGCTTCTTCCGTT-3′ (Primer H), Reaction 2–R5′- AACGGAAGAAGCCCTTCCCACTTATCAAACANNKCTGAATNN- KNNKGATGGAGTTCGGGATGAAAC-3′ (Primer I), and 5′-TCCATTCCTGAACCAATCAAATATTG-3′ (Primer J), Reaction 3–R5′-TTGATTGGTTCAGGAATGGATNNKCGGNNKGAAAACAGTCCATACCTTNNKTTCATCTATACATCATTCC-3′ and Primer G. The three agarose gel-purified reaction products were combined and amplified together with Primer A and Primer G. The resulting product was digested with XbaI andAcc65I and ligated in place of the corresponding portion of the coding sequence for the mature wild-type castor Δ9-18:0-ACP DES in pLac3d. The library contained >106 independent clones. A sample of 19 desaturase clones isolated from colonies that exhibited strong growth in the complementation assay were sequenced. All showed unique sequence combinations at the six targeted positions. Mutant 5.2 was constructed by ligation of the KpnI-BamHI fragment from mutant T117R into the corresponding region of mutant G188L. Castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase variants in plasmid pLac3d were transformed into E. coliMH13/pAnFd cells (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on LB plates that contained ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml), and kanamycin (40 μg/ml) (for selection of pLac-des, pLacAnFd, and the MH13 strain, respectively). For permissive growth, plates were supplemented with oleic acid and Tergitol NP-40 (Sigma) at final concentrations of 250 μg/ml and 0.2% (v/v), respectively. Selection for complementation was performed on agar plates containing 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (lacking unsaturated fatty acid) incubated at 30 °C. Complementation was confirmed by growth of selected colonies in liquid media of the same composition at the same temperature. The sequences of the selected variants of the castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase were determined to identify the substitution(s). MH13/pAnFd cells expressing castor acyl-ACP desaturase variants in vector pLac3 were grown at 30 °C toA 600 ≈0.3 to 0.5 in 25 ml of LB media supplemented with chloramphenicol, kanamycin, ampicillin, and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside as described above. Cells were collected by centrifugation and lipids extracted and dried under N2 (25Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43405) Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were made by transesterification with sodium methoxide (26Roughan G. Nishida I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 276: 38-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and analyzed with the use of a Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC fitted with a 30 m × 0.25 mm (inner diameter) HP-INNOWAX (Hewlett-Packard) column. Oven temperature was raised from 170 °C at 3.5 °C/min to 185 °C after a 25-min hold. Double bond positions of monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters were located by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of dimethyl disulfide derivatives (27Yamamoto K. Shibahara A. Nakayama T. Kajimoto G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1991; 60: 39-50Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Desaturase variant open reading frames were transferred from pLac3d to pET9d. Recombinant protein was generated by expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and enriched to 90–95% purity by 20CM cation exchange chromatography (Applied Biosystems). Castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase variants were assayed with [1-14C]14:0-, [1-14C]16:0-, or [1-14C]18:0-ACP substrates with the use of recombinant spinach ACP-I (28Beremand P.D. Hannapel D.J. Guerra D.J. Kuhn D.N. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Methyl esters of fatty acids were analyzed by argentation TLC and radioactivity in products quantified as described previously (11Cahoon E.B. Shah S. Shanklin J. Browse J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Cahoon E.B. Mills L.A. Shanklin J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 936-939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase and mutant 5.2 assays were performed in triplicate for each of five concentrations typically ranging from one-fifth to five times the K m (where practical) and with each of three substrates: 14:0-, 16:0- and 18:0-ACP. Data were processed with the use of the GraFit data analysis and graphics suite version 3.01 (29Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, version 3.0. Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1992Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters and statistics were based on preprogrammed algorithms within the GraFit suite. It is difficult to predict the locations of amino acids that can affect a property of interest (30Arnold F.H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 125-131Crossref Scopus (482) Google Scholar). For this reason we performed random mutagenesis of the entire 363-amino acid coding region of the desaturase and subjected the mutant population to a selection system to identify mutants active on substrates with chain length <18 carbons. In this way, five positions (114,4 117, 118, 179, and 181) capable of affecting chain length specificity were identified (TableI). Mutagenesis was at, or close to, saturation based on the isolation of the same amino acid changes multiple times (data not shown). Three of the amino acid positions (114, 118, and 179) identified by random mutagenesis were coincident with a group of four (114, 118, 179, and 188) that were previously shown to affect chain length specificity (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and two new amino acid locations, 117 and 181, were identified (Fig.1). In the case of this soluble desaturase enzyme, all six amino acid positions cluster to the region adjacent to the bottom of the substrate-binding pocket, and no sites remote from the substrate binding site were identified. These six locations were therefore selected as targets for combinatorial mutagenesis.Table ISpecific activity of various single-site mutants of the castor Δ9 -18:0-ACP desaturase relative to wtPositionSubstitution by random point mutagenesisSubstrate chain lengthSubstitution by saturation mutagenesisSubstrate chain length14161416M114Ile4 1-aSpecific activities for wt are 0.8 and 11.5 nm/min/mg for 14:0- and 16:0-ACP, respectively, at 1 μm initial substrate concentration.2Phe60.1T117Leu10.5Arg43L118Phe14Phe14P179Leu192Ile237T181Leu14Trp312G188—1-bNo mutations were identified.——Leu14151-a Specific activities for wt are 0.8 and 11.5 nm/min/mg for 14:0- and 16:0-ACP, respectively, at 1 μm initial substrate concentration.1-b No mutations were identified. Open table in a new tab Comparison of the activities of point mutants at each of the selected sites with those from saturation mutagenesis at the same location showed that for four of the six sites (114, 117, 179, and 181) superior mutants were obtained by saturation mutagenesis, an equal improvement for the fifth site (118), and no point mutation was obtained for the sixth site (188) (Table I). The observation that saturation mutagenesis at single sites resulted in larger improvement in the property of interest compared with point mutagenesis prompted us to ask if even larger improvements in specific activity for substrates with fewer than 18 carbons could be made by simultaneously randomizing the six positions able to affect substrate specificity. A library of variants randomized for amino acid substitutions at all six sites was constructed by overlap extension PCR. To select for improvement in activity with substrates <18 carbons in length, the library was introduced into the unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph and challenged on media lacking unsaturated fatty acids. Nineteen colonies that exhibited strong growth under selective conditions subjected to both sequence and activity analyses. Sequence analysis revealed that all 19 clones contained a unique combination of amino acids at the six randomized positions. When analyzed for specific activity, com2 (M114A/T117R/L118G/P179V/T181V/G188L) showed the greatest improvement in substrates containing fewer than 18-carbons, i.e. 52-fold for 14-carbon substrates and 15-fold for 16-carbon substrates (TableII). Of note, five of the 19 strongly complementing mutants (com2, com3, com4, com9, and com10) contained the same pair of changes, T117R/G188L, found in com2 (Table II). The wide range of specific activities among the different complementing mutants containing the T117R/G188L pair of mutations suggested the presence of detrimental mutations in one or more of the remaining four positions. This was confirmed by construction of the double mutant (5.2) T117R/G188L (in which the other targeted positions contained residues found in wt desaturase) that showed a 35-fold increase in specific activity with respect to the 16-carbon substrate and a 24-fold increase for the 14-carbon substrate (Table II).Table IISubstitutions at specific positions of the castor Δ9 -18:0-ACP desaturase mutants containing the T117R/G188L pair of mutations and their specific activity relative to wtPosition 2-aSaturation mutagenesis was performed at all six sites simultaneously, see “Experimental Procedures.”Relative activity 2-bSee Table I for specific activity information., chain length1141171181791811881416WtMTLPTG11com2ARGVVL5215com3QRPVDL01com4TRALSL1611com9VRGSCL34com10YRPAFL325.22-cMutant 5.2, T117R/G118L in wt background.MRLPTL24352-a Saturation mutagenesis was performed at all six sites simultaneously, see “Experimental Procedures.”2-b See Table I for specific activity information.2-c Mutant 5.2, T117R/G118L in wt background. Open table in a new tab To gain insight into the mechanism underlying changes in substrate specificity, we performed a comparative kinetic analysis on wt and mutant 5.2 (Fig.2 and TableIII). The data show that wt desaturase has a different K m for different substrates, 0.46 μm for 18-carbon, 5.0 μm for 16-carbon, and 4.6 μm for 14-carbon substrates. However, in the case of the double mutant 5.2 the K m for 16-carbon substrate has decreased by an order of magnitude from 5.0 to 0.55 μm, while the K m for 18- and 14-carbon substrates have changed from 0.46 to 0.98 μm and from 4.6 to 1.1 μm,respectively. Together these changes result in an increase in specificity factor from 0.56 to 46 μmol−1min−1 for the 16-carbon substrate, and a decrease from 92 to 5 μmol−1min−1 for the 18-carbon substrate (Table III).

Stemmer W.P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For the desaturase changes in regiospecificity had accompanied earlier attempts to alter chain length specificity (19Cahoon E.B. Shanklin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the position of the introduced double bond by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the dimethyl disulfide derivative of the desaturated fatty acid product of mutant 5.2. The only detectable product was 16:1 in which the double bond was exclusively located at the Δ9-position (Fig. 4) showing that the regiospecificity is unchanged from that of wt desaturase. Combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of six residues shown individually to affect chain length specificity, in combination with selection using an unsaturated fatty acid auxotrophy complementation system in combination with logical redesign, led to the engineering of a desaturase enzyme with preference for 16-carbon substrate with kinetic parameters similar to those of wt desaturase for the 18-carbon substrate. The activity of the resulting mutant 5.2 is >100-fold improved with respect to those reported for naturally occurring 16:0-Δ9 desaturases from Milkweed and Doxantha(5Cahoon E.B. Coughlan S.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism underlying the observed improvement in specific activity of mutant 5.2, we performed a kinetic analysis in which we included wt castor Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase as the control. The experiments with wt desaturase yielded aK m value for 18-carbon substrate of 0.46 (±0.05) μm. In contrast, previous studies have reported a range of K m values: 3.3 (±0.42) μm for (the same castor desaturase) (7Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12833-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), 0.38 μm for the safflower enzyme (4McKeon T.A. Stumpf P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12141-12147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 13 (±8) μm for a soybean isoform (32Gibson K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have confidence in the values reported here for several reasons. First, the estimates of substrate concentrations are based on specific radioactivity of the substrate; second, the values show the smallest statistical variability; and third, the values are based on a ranges of substrate concentrations typically from one-fifth to five times theK m value. All of these conditions were not met in the studies described above. In addition, the values for wt enzyme presented here are consistent with the pool sizes of long chain acyl-ACPs in plants that are in the high nm range (33Post-Beittenmiller D. Jaworski J.G. Ohlrogge J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1858-1865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar),i.e. comparable with the K m for 18:0-ACP, but below the K m for 16:0-ACP. The K m value for mutant 5.2 with the 16-carbon substrate decreased ∼10-fold with respect to that of the wt enzyme,i.e. to 0.55 (±0./06) μm from 5.0 (±0.56) μm, respectively. It is interesting to note that the physiological selection system used to identify the mutations used to engineer mutant 5.2 resulted in an enzyme with a K m value almost identical to the K m of 0.46 (±0.06) μm reported (above) for the wt enzyme with the 18-carbon substrate. In addition to changes in binding affinities for different substrates between wt and mutant 5.2, there were also substantial changes ink cat. Mutant 5.2 showed a large increase ink cat of 25.3 min−1 as compared with 2.8 min−1 for wt enzyme with the 16-carbon substrate. Together, these changes in K m and k cat resulted in an 82-fold increase in the specificity factor (k cat/K m ) for 16-carbon substrates with mutant 5.2, accompanied by an 18-fold decrease for 18-carbon substrates (Table III). The decrease in log(k cat/K m ) for wt desaturase as the substrate length decreases from 18 to 14 carbons (Fig. 3) is similar to that reported previously (7Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12833-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the differences in bothKM and kcat values between wt and mutant 5.2 suggest the factors that contribute to turnover may be more complex than simply the change in binding energy as proposed previously for wt enzyme with different substrates (7Haas J.A. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12833-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus for mutant 5.2, the decrease in binding energy of the 16-carbon substrate did not prevent the observed 35-fold improvement in specific activity. In structural terms the change in specificity factor between 18- and 16-carbon substrates likely represents loss of methyl contact at the base of the binding pocket in addition to two methylenes from the wall of the pocket. This has a larger effect on affinity and/or substrate positioning than the loss of interaction of a further two methylenes with the wall of the binding pocket with a 14-carbon substrate. In mutant 5.2, bulkier arginine and leucine residues replace threonine and glycine at the end of the binding pocket, apparently shortening the binding pocket and making it more effective for a 16-carbon substrate but less effective for an 18-carbon substrate. The com2 and com4 enzymes on the other hand are more active on 14- than 16-carbon substrates, presumably reflecting the contributions of other residues to binding affinity or positioning of the substrate for catalysis. Powerful methods have recently been developed to evolve enzymesin vitro (34Arnold F.H. Volkov A.A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). They generally use point mutagenesis and identify improved variants followed by recombination of improved isolates to effect further improvements in the property of interest. A limitation inherent to this approach is that it relies on the relatively small subset of four to seven mutations achievable by single base substitution at each location. We note that neither of the pair of substitutions identified in this study, T117R and G188L, would have been reached by single-base substitution. These results support the contention that saturation mutagenesis can generate superior variants to those arising from the subset of possibilities available via point mutagenesis (35Miyazaki K. Arnold F.H. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 49: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In this context, amino acids can be regarded as “molecular shims,” and the larger the number of shim sizes introduced at a particular amino acid location, the more likely that some “optimal substrate binding geometry” will be approached (36Shanklin J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Performing simultaneous saturation mutagenesis at a number of key locations capable of affecting the property of interest simply extends the number of combinations and permutations of binding site geometry. In this case, the loss of desolvation energy of two methylene groups when binding a 16- rather than an 18-carbon substrate was mostly overcome by improved substrate binding orientation with respect to the active site oxidant and improved substrate fit resulting from occlusion of the floor of the binding pocket. In summary, these data show that it is possible to alter the specificity of a desaturase enzyme without substantial degradation of its kinetic parameters. The Δ9-16:0-ACP desaturase, 5.2, constructed from a Δ9-18:0-ACP desaturase is far more active than either naturally occurring Δ9-16:0-ACP desaturases. Taken together, these results suggest it should be generally possible to reengineer archetypal enzymes with substrate specificities characteristic of newly evolved enzymes while retaining the desired stability and/or turnover characteristics of the parental paralog.

Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar). In contrast to most DNA-binding proteins, which are presented with a double-stranded B-form helix of uniform structure in which bases can be contacted through the major groove, RNA-binding proteins must be able to bind targets with widely differing structures. Because the steep and narrow groove of double-stranded RNA does not provide proteins easy access to the bases for sequence-specific recognition, most RNA-binding proteins recognize single-stranded regions or distorted double-stranded regions in which the major groove has been widened by bulges, hairpins, or loops (2Draper D.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The natural variety of RNA targets is bound by a limited collection of RNA-binding motifs (1Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G.

The most common of these motifs is the ribonucleoprotein (RNP)1consensus domain or the RNA-binding domain, also referred to as the RNA recognition motif (RRM). This motif is characterized by two conserved stretches of eight and six amino acid residues (RNP-1 and RNP-2) and a β-α-β-β-α-β secondary structure (see Fig.1 A) (3Nagai K. Oubridge C. Ito N. Avis J.

An RRM that binds very tightly to its RNA target is the N-terminal RRM of the spliceosomal protein U1A, which binds to an RNA hairpin in the U1 small nucleolar (sn) RNP (U1 hairpin (hp) II or U1hpII) (see Fig. 1).The U1A/U1hpII interaction has been used as a paradigm for RNA binding by a single RRM and has been the subject of a multitude of biochemical and structural analyses (4Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Despite these extensive studies, little is known to date about the mechanism and kinetics of this protein/RNA interaction. Using the previously solved structure of the U1A·U1hpII complex, we have engineered a series of mutants designed to individually examine the roles of electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, aromatic stacking, and RNA loop length, all of which have been implicated in formation of the U1A·U1hpII complex (5–16). The effects of these mutations on the binding dynamics were studied using a surface plasmon resonance-based biosensor (BIACORE), which permits the real-time monitoring of complex formation and dissociation (17Morton T.A.

First, well placed positively charged residues on the protein allow it to rapidly associate with the RNA. Next, close-range interactions at the RNA/protein interface allow the formation of a very stable complex. Together, these steps result in the high affinity of U1A for its U1 hairpin II RNA target (K D ∼32 pm). A similar two-step mechanism may play a role in many high affinity RNA/protein interactions.

https://openalex.org/W2021194636,"The expression of several proteins with critical functions in iron metabolism is regulated post-transcriptionally by the binding of iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, to mRNA iron responsive elements (IREs). In iron-deficient tissues and cultured cells, both IRP1 and IRP2 are activated for high affinity IRE binding. Previous work showed that IRP1 is also activated when cultured cells are exposed to H2O2. The well established role of iron and H2O2 in tissue injury (based on Fenton chemistry) suggests that this response may have important pathophysiological implications. This is particularly relevant in inflammation, where cytotoxic immune cells release large amounts of reactive oxygen species. Here, we describe a rat liver perfusion model to study IRP1 activation under H2O2 generation conditions that mimic a physiological inflammatory response, using steady-state concentrations of H2O2 produced by a glucose/ glucose oxidase/catalase system. We show first that stimulated neutrophils are able to increase serum levels of H2O2 by a factor of 10, even in the presence of H2O2-degrading erythrocytes. We further show that perfusion of rat liver with glucose oxidase leads to a rapid activation of IRE binding activity in the intact organ. Mobility shift assays with liver extracts and IRP1 or IRP2-specific probes indicate that only IRP1 responds to H2O2. Our study demonstrates a principal existence of iron regulation by oxidative stress at the intact organ level.

Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. Clarendon, Oxford1991: 319-368Google Scholar). While these properties explain why iron is an essential constituent for a multitude of biochemical activities, they also render it potentially toxic for cells and tissues. In the presence of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs),1 iron catalyzes the generation of hydroxyl radicals (Fenton/Haber-Weiss reactions) that damage membrane lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 1-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (4450) Google Scholar). Considering that ROIs, including H2O2 and O⨪2, are inevitable byproducts of aerobiosis, cells have to tightly control intracellular iron levels to minimize iron toxicity and satisfy its metabolic needs. Pathologic conditions of iron overload are associated with tissue injury, neurodegeneration, and malignancy (3Halliwell, B., Gutteridge, J. M. C., Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, 3rd Ed, 1999, Clarendon Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). For example, hereditary hemochromatosis, one of the most prevalent human genetic disorders, is caused by a defect in the regulation of iron absorption (4Bothwell T.H. Nutr. Rev. 1995; 53: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). As there is no physiological mechanism for iron secretion, this defect leads to iron accumulation and gradual deposition in liver (and heart) parenchymal cells. Because of extensive liver iron overload with progressing age, hemochromatosis patients eventually develop liver fibrosis and cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (5Barisani D. Green R.M. Gollan J.L. Dig. Dis. 1996; 14: 304-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cellular iron uptake involves binding of the soluble plasma iron carrier transferrin to the cell-surface transferrin receptor (TfR), followed by endocytosis and iron release into the cytoplasm. A fraction of iron is utilized for the synthesis of iron-containing proteins, and excess iron is stored in ferritin, a multisubunit protein of H- and L-chains. The expression of TfR and ferritin are controlled post-transcriptionally by binding of two cytoplasmic iron regulatory proteins, IRP1 and IRP2, to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in their mRNAs. Both IRPs are activated by iron deficiency to bind to IREs as monomers, resulting in the stabilization of TfR mRNA, which contains multiple IREs in the 3′-untranslated region, and translational inhibition of ferritin mRNA, that harbors a single IRE in the 5′-untranslated region (6Hentze M.W. Kόhn L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8175-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 7Rouault T. Klausner R. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1997; 35: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). IRP1 is a bifunctional protein that assembles a cubane 4Fe-4S cluster and functions as a cytosolic aconitase in iron-repleted cells. Conversely, the cluster dissociates in iron-starved cells, and IRP1 binds to IREs in its apo form. IRP2 is homologous to IRP1; however, IRP2 activity rises in iron-deficient cells by stabilization of the protein. Both IRPs respond to additional, iron-independent signals such as NO and oxidative stress (8Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). By employing various cell lines, we and others have previously shown that IRP1 is rapidly activated when cells are exposed to low micromolar concentrations of H2O2 (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 11Martins E.A. Robalinho R.L. Meneghini R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, IRP1 activation by H2O2 is not the simple consequence of a direct attack of H2O2 on the 4Fe-4S cluster but rather appears to involve stress-response signaling (12Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10559-10563Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, this finding has established a novel regulatory connection between iron metabolism and oxidative stress, which is striking considering the role of H2O2 in iron toxicity (Fenton chemistry). Activation of IRP1 by H2O2 results in enhanced expression of TfR and increased cellular iron uptake from transferrin, whereas it also leads to a significant reduction of the iron storage protein ferritin (13Caltagirone A Weiss G Pantopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although these data may help to understand iron-mediated tissue damage, as yet, studies have only been performed in cultured cell lines. Here we investigate the response of IRP1 to H2O2 in the intact liver, a key organ for iron homeostasis, iron pathogenesis, and oxygen turnover. We demonstrate the ability of H2O2 to modulate hepatic iron metabolism at the intact organ level. This finding is particularly relevant in the light of the capacity of the liver to efficiently degrade H2O2. Luminol, phosphate-buffered saline, HANKS buffer, H2O2, catalase, sodium hypochlorite, glucose oxidase, and sodium azide were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Human HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 4.5 g/l glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 ng/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Stock solutions of luminol were prepared in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline and adjusted to pH 7.4. Stock solutions of NaOCl and H2O2 were prepared in water. Their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically (ε290 = 350 mol liter−1 cm−1 at pH 12 (14) and ε230 = 74 mol liter−1cm−1 (15Beers R.F. Sizer I.W. J. Biol.

Phosphate-buffered saline/Dulbecco (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, 1.48 mmKH2PO4, 0.49 mmMgCl2·6H2O, 0.9 mmCaCl2) was used as phosphate buffer (phosphate-buffered saline). For cell preparations, a HANKS buffer was used (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4, 1.47 mmMgCl2·, 0.9 mmCaCl2). Unfractionated leukocytes (neutrophils and lymphocytes/monocytes) or isolated erythrocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes were obtained as described by Boyum et al. (16Boyum, A., Lovhaug, D., and Tresland, L. (1991) Blood Separation and Plasma Fractionation, pp. 217–239Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, heparinized blood from healthy volunteers was underlayed with 50% (by volume) histopaque (Sigma) and centrifuged at 400 ×g for 30 min to separate all cells from the blood plasma. The interphase (lymphocytes and monocytes) was further washed with NaCl 0.9%, and erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis using distilled water. The pellet (neutrophils and erythrocytes) was resuspended in 0.9% NaCl, centrifuged at 600 × g for 7 min. The pellet was resuspended in Hanks I buffer and incubated with 5% dextran sulfate (Sigma) at a volume ratio of 1:10 for 40 min at room temperature. The pellet (erythrocytes) was further washed with 0.9% NaCl. The supernatant (neutrophils) was further washed with 0.9% NaCl, and erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis using distilled water. For the determination of cell number, a Celldyn 1700 (Abbott, Great Britain) was used. A sensitive nonenzymatic chemiluminescence assay was used for the determination of H2O2 (17Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 18Mueller, S., and Pantopoulos, K. (2001) Methods Enzymol., in press.Google Scholar, 19Mueller S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and a flow technique was employed to determine glucose oxidase activity (20Mueller S. Riedel H.D. Stremmel W. Blood. 1997; 90: 4973-4978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mueller S. Riedel D.H. Stremmel W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, a solution of glucose and glucose oxidase aspirated by a peristaltic pump (4 ml/min) was mixed with luminol (10−4 mol/liter) and hypochlorite (10−4 mol/liter), continuously added by a perfusion pump (6 ml/min). This procedure allows monitoring of the actual H2O2 concentration in real time by measuring the luminescence emitted. H2O2generation by leukocytes was determined using an injection technique as described previously (17Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of 5 × 10−6m NaOCl (final concentration) were injected into 950 μl of a cell suspension containing 5 × 10−5m luminol. Chemiluminescence was determined immediately after injection over 2 s. Samples with known concentrations of H2O2 were used for calibration. All luminescence measurements were performed using a AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer (Fa. Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Liver perfusion was established according to standard procedures (22Bartosek I. Guaitani A. Miller L.L. Isolated Liver Perfusion and Its Applications. Raven Press, New York1973Google Scholar). Rat livers were perfused at 20 ml/min via a peristaltic pump in a single path system with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (0.3 mm pyruvate, 2 mm lactate). The temperature was kept at 37 °C, and the buffer was saturated with oxygen. The pH was maintained at 7.4 by exposure to carbon dioxide. As determined with an oxygen electrode, the oxygen concentration was only reduced to 80% after liver passage under our perfusion conditions indicating a sufficient oxygen supply of the organ. Lactate dehydrogenase, potassium, and sodium were determined in a routine clinical laboratory to determine common parameters of cell toxicity. In the experiments with GOX, GOX was added to the buffer reservoir with an final activity of 3 × 10−7m/s H2O2 corresponding to the H2O2 release by human leukocytes at cell concentrations found in vivo (see “Results”). Catalase was further added (final activity: k = 0.003 s−1) to prevent accumulation of H2O2. EMSAs were performed as described earlier using a radiolabeled human ferritin H-chain IRE probe (9Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). IRP1- or IRP2-specific probes were generated from plasmids CG 125 (IRP2) (23Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Kόhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4900-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and no. 34 (IRP1) (24Henderson B.R. Menotti E. Bonnard C. Kühn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17481-17489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA-protein complex formation was quantified by densitometric scanning of the depicted autoradiographs. Treatment of cultured cells with a bolus of 100 μm H2O2 results in rapid activation of IRP1 within 30–60 min. Previous studies have provided evidence that this response is elicited by extracellular H2O2 and that a mere increase in intracellular H2O2 levels is not sufficient to activate IRP1 (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); inhibition of peroxisomal catalase by aminotriazole caused a significant and rapid increase in intracellular H2O2, but no IRP1 activation could be detected under these conditions. By contrast, even a modest increase in the extracellular H2O2 concentration was sufficient to rapidly induce IRP-1 in the absence of an observable increase in intracellular H2O2 concentration (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Stimulated neutrophils and macrophages are considered to represent a major physiological source of extracellular H2O2 in the organism, although other cell types also release smaller quantities of H2O2 (3Halliwell, B., Gutteridge, J. M. C., Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine, 3rd Ed, 1999, Clarendon Press, Oxford.Google Scholar). To study the effects of extracellular H2O2 on hepatic IRP1 at the intact organ level, we established a non-recirculating rat liver perfusion model, which allows the application of H2O2 from the sinusoid/extracellular compartment of the liver. Contrary to experiments with cultured cell lines, perfusion of the rat liver with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 100 μmH2O2 for 60 min failed to activate IRP1 (Fig.1, upper panel), although the presence of activable IRP1 could be demonstrated by the addition of 2% 2-mercaptoethanol to all lysates (Fig. 1, lower panel). H2O2 was stable in perfusion buffer that was not used for liver perfusion (data not shown). A possible interpretation of this unexpected result might be that H2O2 does not activate IRP1 at the intact organ level, challenging the physiological significance of previous studies. Alternatively, the perfusion of the liver with H2O2 may not accurately mimic in vivo conditions, as hepatic catalase and glutathione peroxidase are very efficient in H2O2 degradation. For instance, catalase activity in liver homogenate is as high as ∼kcat = 200 s−1 (withkcat as the exponential rate constant of catalase activity), reducing the half-time of H2O2 to less than 3.5 ms (21Mueller S. Riedel D.H. Stremmel W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a direct consequence, only a few liver cells would be exposed to concentrations of H2O2 sufficient to activate IRP1 in the perfusion experiment. This is certainly not the case during the oxidative burst of neutrophils and macrophages during inflammation, where H2O2 can be generated continuously over hours and days and within a more extensive area. To simulate exposure of the liver to H2O2 in vivo more closely, the generation of H2O2 in activated neutrophils was investigated. During the oxidative burst of neutrophils, a plasma membrane-bound NADPH oxidase generates O⨪2, which, at physiological pH, is spontaneously disproportionated to H2O2 and water (25Babior B.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 659-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Superoxide dismutase increases the rate of this reaction almost 10000-fold (26Green J.G. Hill H.A.O. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 4-22Google Scholar). Compared with O⨪2, H2O2 constitutes a rather stable oxygen metabolite. To trigger an oxidative burst, we treated a suspension of neutrophils with 100 ng/ml PMA and determined the actual concentration of H2O2 in suspension at different time points (Fig.2 a). Under these conditions, a maximum concentration of H2O2 in the micromolar range (∼2 μm H2O2) was reached, confirming earlier observations (17Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Test S.T. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 399-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, levels of H2O2 cannot be further elevated by increasing the cell number. At higher cell numbers, H2O2is also more rapidly degraded upon stimulation with PMA. This degradation is completely inhibited by sodium azide, a known inhibitor of catalase and myeloperoxidase (17Mueller S. Arnhold J. J. Biolumin. Chemilumin. 1995; 10: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28Klebanoff S.J. Waltersdorph A.M. Rosen H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18660) Google Scholar), suggesting that these heme-containing enzymes are the main H2O2consumers (data not shown). Because the degradation rate of H2O2 by catalase depends on the H2O2 concentration, this enzyme seems to restrict the maximum H2O2 concentration in stimulated leukocytes. The inhibition of H2O2degradation by sodium azide can be utilized to determine the generation rate of H2O2 (in m/s). When 106 neutrophils per ml were stimulated with PMA, we determined the H2O2 generation rate to be 3.2 × 10−8m/s corresponding to 19 nmol H2O2 (107 cells)−1min−1 (data not shown). Assuming normal leukocyte concentrations in the whole blood of about 6 million cells/ml, a maximum generation rate of 0.2 μmH2O2/s is calculated. This experimentally determined H2O2 generation rate was used to study the activation of IRP1 by H2O2 in the perfused liver. To study whether erythrocytic catalase and glutathione peroxidase would efficiently remove oxygen-burst-derived H2O2, we determined H2O2 concentrations in highly diluted blood. Under these conditions, the steady-state concentration of H2O2 still increased by a factor of ten upon stimulation with 100 ng/ml PMA (Fig. 2 b). Because erythrocytes and leukocytes were used at their original ratio, the results are expected to reflect the in vivo conditions. In conclusion, H2O2 concentrations may drastically change during the inflammatory response of leukocytes, potentially affecting redox-sensitive signaling cascades such as the IRE/IRP regulatory network. The isolated liver of a male Wistar rat was perfused in situ with Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing glucose/GOX. This procedure leads to the generation of a continuous flux of H2O2 (30Mueller, S., Pantopoulos, K., Hentze, M. W., Stremmel, W., Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons, Hastings, J. W., Kricka, L. J., Stanley, P. E., 1997, 338, 341, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, Sussex.Google Scholar). The amount of GOX was calculated to yield 0.2 μm/s H2O2, comparable with that released by stimulated neutrophils. To assess the response of liver IRP1 to the exposure to H2O2, liver lobules were removed every 10 min, and IRE binding activity in liver cytoplasmic extracts was monitored by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.3). Under these conditions, IRP activation is apparent within 20 min of liver perfusion, increasing IRP activity within 1 h by a factor of 25. To confirm the equal loading of all lanes, cell extracts were treated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, which activates IRP1 in vitro (31Hentze M.W. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Klausner R.D. Science. 1989; 244: 357-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In kinetic terms, this result corroborates previous observations in cultured fibroblasts (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It should be noted that no significant release of lactate dehydrogenase, change in electrolyte composition (sodium and potassium), or visible morphological alteration of the liver were observed during perfusion (data not shown), indicating that H2O2 was, as expected, not toxic under the conditions of the experiment. To evaluate whether the H2O2-mediated increase in IRE binding activity in the liver corresponds to IRP1 and/or IRP2 activation, we utilized IRP1 and IRP2-specific IRE probes and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays in liver extracts. The results shown in Fig. 4 reveal that IRP1 not only accounts for the H2O2-mediated increase in IRP activity but also demonstrates that IRP1 is the predominant iron regulatory protein in rat liver. In contrast to this, HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, are rich in IRP2. Whereas the analysis with IRP2-specific probes showed that any IRE binding activity of IRP2 in rat liver extracts is below detection levels, the respective fraction of IRE binding activity in HepG2 extracts is about 40%. The initial finding that H2O2 activates IRP1 in tissue culture cells raised intriguing mechanistic and physiological questions. A series of experiments focused on the elucidation of the underlying mechanism. The results obtained so far have provided evidence that the activation of IRP1 requires signaling activity by H2O2, rather than a direct chemical modification of its 4Fe-4S cluster by H2O2. First, IRP1 activation takes place in intact cells but not when cell extracts are exposed to H2O2 (32Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2917-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment of highly purified human recombinant 4Fe-4S IRP1 with H2O2 yields 3Fe-4S IRP1, which suffices to destroy the aconitase of the 4Fe-4S IRP1 activity but does not activate IRE binding (33Brazzolotto X. Gaillard J. Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Moulis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21625-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Second, in cells treated with H2O2, activation of IRP1 follows biphasic kinetics and can be completed in the absence of H2O2 (8Pantopoulos K. Weiss G. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In fact, the presence of a threshold concentration of H2O2 (estimated ∼10 μm) is only required for 10–15 min (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Mueller, S., Pantopoulos, K., Hentze, M. W., Stremmel, W., Bioluminescence and Chemiluminescence: Molecular Reporting with Photons, Hastings, J. W., Kricka, L. J., Stanley, P. E., 1997, 338, 341, John Wiley & Sons Ltd, Chichester, Sussex.Google Scholar). Third, a mere increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen intermediates (including H2O2) is not sufficient to elicit IRP1 activation (10Pantopoulos K. Mueller S. Atzberger A. Ansorge W. Stremmel W. Hentze M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9802-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Finally, reconstitution of H2O2–mediated induction of IRP1 in an in vitro system of permeabilized cells suggests the involvement of membrane-associated factor(s) and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation steps in the pathway (34Pantopoulos K. Hentze M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10559-10563Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Whereas IRP1 activation by H2O2 has been extensively studied in cultured cells and in vitro, the physiological implications of IRP1 activation by H2O2 in intact organs have not yet received comparable attention. The responses of the IRP/IRE regulatory network toward oxidative stress warrant particular consideration in the context of inflammation, where activated immune effector cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, undergo a respiratory burst resulting in the generation and release of reactive oxygen species to combat infection. To gain insight into pathophysiological aspects of the IRP1 response to H2O2, we perfused rat liver with H2O2 under conditions that mimic the oxidative burst of phagocytes. We show that perfusion of the liver with 100 μm H2O2 is not sufficient to activate liver IRP1, although an analogous treatment of cultured cells is effective. The high H2O2-degrading capacity of the liver plausibly explains this result, since the half-life of H2O2 in the liver was estimated to lie within the millisecond range (21Mueller S. Riedel D.H. Stremmel W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These considerations suggested that the perfusion of rat liver with H2O2 might not faithfully mimic in vivo conditions. Following the determination of the rate of H2O2 generation in PMA-stimulated neutrophils, we calibrated an H2O2-generating system based on the oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase. This setting allowed to mimic H2O2 generation during the oxidative burst. Moreover, it provided a model system to study the effects of H2O2 on IRP1 in an intact organ, uncoupled from the pleiotropic effects of neutrophil stimulation. Perfusion of rat liver with GOX leads to the rapid, although incomplete, activation of IRP1. This result validates earlier observations made in cultured cells at the intact organ level. The increase in IRE binding activity by H2O2 is based on IRP1 activation, as no IRP2 activity was detectable even with IRP2-specific probes. This is in agreement with the previous observation that the liver contains predominantly IRP1 (35Guo B., Yu, Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24252-24260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our study not only demonstrates a principal existence of iron regulation by oxidative stress in the liver, but it also links it to the inflammatory response, as H2O2 is a main product of the oxidative burst cascade of leukocytes. The response of the IRE/IRP regulatory system to different conditions of oxidative stress may be more complex. Different from the observed activation of IRP1 by H2O2 in the intact liver, incubation of rat liver homogenates with xanthine oxidase, which generates both superoxide anions (O⨪2) and H2O2, has been reported to cause a reversible inhibition of IRP activity (36Cairo G. Tacchini L. Recalcati S. Azzimonti B. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Cairo G. Castrusini E. Minotti G. Bernelli-Zazzera A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1326-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In an ischemia-reperfusion model, a pathologic condition that is also thought to involve oxidative stress, the same investigators observed an initial reduction of IRP activity (38Tacchini L. Recalcati S. Bernelli-Zazzera A. Cairo G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 946-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The liver is an important iron storage organ that is primarily affected in disorders of iron overload. As activation of IRP1 directly leads to up-regulation of TfR and down-regulation of ferritin synthesis, increased H2O2 levels would trigger a shift of extracellular iron toward the free cytosolic compartment. A shift of iron into various intracellular compartments is exactly the situation observed in humans under conditions of inflammation. In contrast to chronic iron deficiency, chronic inflammation decreases blood iron levels i.e. extracellular iron concentration. This inflammation-induced decrease in extracellular iron concentration is not a global net deficiency in iron but reflects a shift from the extracellular phase into the intracellular compartment (39Konijn A.M. Carmel N. Levy R. Hershko C. Br. J. Haematol. 1981; 49: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Konijn A.M. Hershko C. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 37: 7-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, also more localized chronic inflammations like chronic hepatitis C seems to be associated with an increased intracellular iron level. Almost half of all cases with hepatitis C show nonhemochromatosis iron overload (41Pirisi M. Scott C.A. Avellini C. Toniutto P. Fabris C. Soardo G. Beltrami C.A. Bartoli E. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2000; 113: 546-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings hence resemble some clinical observations and suggest a study of the involvement of H2O2 in determining the distribution of iron in inflammation.

The removal of apoptotic cells by phagocytes prevents secondary necrosis and inflammation and also plays a key role in tissue remodeling and regulating immune responses. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the engulfment of apoptotic cells are just beginning to be elucidated. Recent genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated at least six genes in the removal of apoptotic cell corpses. The gene products of ced-2, ced-5, and ced-10are thought to be part of a pathway that regulates the reorganization of the cytoskeleton during engulfment. The adapter proteins CrkII and Dock180 and the small GTPase Rac represent the mammalian orthologues of the ced-2, ced-5 and ced-10 gene products, respectively. It is not known whether CrkII, Dock180, or Rac proteins have any role during engulfment in mammalian cells. Here we show, using stable cell lines and transient transfections, that overexpression of wild-type CrkII or an activated form of Rac1 enhances engulfment. Mutants of CrkII failed to mediate this increased engulfment. The higher CrkII-mediated uptake was inhibited by coexpression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 but not by a dominant a negative Rho protein; this suggested that Rac functions downstream of CrkII in this process, which is consistent with genetic studies in the worm that place ced-10 (rac) downstream ofced-2 (crk) in cell corpse removal. Taken together, these data suggest that CED-2/CrkII and CED-10/Rac are part of an evolutionarily conserved pathway in engulfment of apoptotic cells.

Programmed cell death is a process that occurs in various tissues of the body throughout ontogeny (1Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The apoptosis of specific cells is closely linked to the removal of apoptotic bodies/cell corpses (2Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 3Fadok V.A. Henson P.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R693-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Aderem A.

The removal of the dying cells before the integrity of the cell membrane is lost prevents the release of potentially harmful contents, thus protecting the neighboring cells. Engulfment also plays a key role in tissue remodeling and in regulating immune responses (2Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 3Fadok V.A.

In mammals, macrophages and immature dendritic cells are thought to carry out the majority of the apoptotic cell removal, although clearly other cell types can perform this function in different tissues (1Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 4Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev.

The dying cells expose several “eat-me” signals or apoptotic markers that can be recognized by the phagocytic cells through one or more cell surface receptors (2Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The subsequent intracellular signaling events in the phagocyte lead to cytoskeletal rearrangements that facilitate the engulfment of the dying cells. The signaling during engulfment also regulates the cytokine secretion by the phagocyte (1Green D.R. Beere H.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 28-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar,2Savill J. Fadok V. Nature. 2000; 407: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). One of the eat-me signals is the exposure on the cell surface of phosphatidylserine (PS), 1The abbreviations used are: PSphosphatidylserineSH2/SH3Src homology 2/3wtwild typeFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced green fluorescent protein a lipid normally found only on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and that can be detected by annexin V staining (7Fadok V.A.

Modifications to glycosylation patterns on cell surface proteins and a change in the surface charge of the dying cells can also serve as apoptotic markers, although the mechanisms for their recognition have been less well defined (13Ezekewitz R.A.

Although progress has been made in identifying some of the phagocytic receptors, relatively little is known about coordination of the specific intracellular signaling events downstream of these receptors and how they regulate engulfment of apoptotic cells. phosphatidylserine Src homology 2/3 wild type fluorescence-activated cell sorter green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein Elegant genetic studies in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have implicated at least six genes segregated into two partially redundant complementation groups as important in the engulfment of apoptotic cells (with ced-1, ced-6,and ced-7 in one group and ced-2,ced-5, and ced-10 in another) (15Ellis R.E.

In the first complementation group, ced-6 encodes an adapter protein, hCED-6, containing a PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain,ced-7 encodes the homologue of the mammalian ATP-binding cassette transporter protein, ABC1, whereas the identity ofced-1 has not yet been reported (17Wu Y.C.

In the second complementation group,ced-2 encodes the homologue of the mammalian adapter protein CrkII, ced-5 the homologue of the large adapter protein Dock180, and ced-10 the small GTPase Rac (19Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A role for Crk has been recognized in the migration of fibroblasts (25Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). CrkII, via its SH3 domain, interacts with Dock180, and Dock180 itself has been shown to bind to nucleotide-free Rac (26Nolan K.M. Barrett K. Lu Y. Hu K.Q. Vincent S. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of CrkII and Dock180 in 293T cells can enhance the formation of GTP-bound Rac (27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 28Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The activated GTP-bound form of Rac has been shown to regulate the cytoskeleton in many systems including macrophages (29Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar, 30Greenberg S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Thus, based on the genetic studies in the worm, it has been proposed that theced-2/ced-5/ced-10 gene products may be part of pathway that regulates reorganization of the cytoskeleton during engulfment (19Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether CrkII, Dock180, or Rac proteins play a role in engulfment in mammalian cells. In this report, we examined the role of the adapter protein CrkII and the GTPase Rac1 in mammalian engulfment. We observe that overexpression of CrkII or Rac in the LR73 cell line enhances phagocytosis and that the CrkII-mediated increased uptake is dependent on downstream signaling through Rac. These data suggest that CED-2/CrkII and CED-10/Rac are part of an evolutionarily conserved pathway in engulfment of apoptotic cells. The phagocytic LR73 Chinese hamster ovary cell line was cultured in Alpha's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin/l-glutamine as described previously (31Su H.P.

The plasmids encoding Myc-tagged wt or mutant CrkII were kindly provided by Michiyuki Matsuda (Tokyo, Japan). The plasmids encoding Rac1L61, Rac1N17, and RhoN19 were provided by Dr. J. T. Parsons (University of Virginia), and the PEZ-EGFP3 plasmid was provided by Dr. Ian Macara (University of Virginia). pEBG-Shc, from our laboratory, has been described previously (32Ravichandran K.S.

The anti-Myc and anti-CrkII antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). For stable transfections, the LR73 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method with 20 μg of linearized plasmids encoding Myc-tagged rat CrkII wt or mutants (28Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) along with 0.5 μg of a puromycin plasmid for selection. Stable single colonies were picked and analyzed for CrkII expression by immunoblotting using anti-c-Myc or anti-CrkII. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (31Su H.P. Brugnera E. Van Criekinge W. Smits E. Hengartner M. Bogaert T. Ravichandran K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9542-9549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, LipofectAMINE-2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. At least two wells were independently transfected for each condition/plasmid combination, the duplicate samples were processed separately in the rest of the experiment, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. All transient transfection experiments were performed multiple times with the data presented being representative of at least three independent experiments. Briefly, 150,000 LR73 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates. The cells were transfected the next day by incubation with plain medium containing 2 μl LipofectAMINE-2000 and 0.8 μg of each plasmid for 6 h, washed, and incubated with fresh medium (10% serum and no antibiotic) for 24 h before the phagocytosis assays were performed as described below. 20,000 LR73 cells/well were plated in 24-well plates and used 2–3 days later. Apoptotic thymocytes used as targets were labeled in one of two ways. Thymocytes from 6-week-old mice were harvested and labeled with the lipophilic red fluorescent dye PKH-26 (6 μm for 5 min). The excess dye was quenched and the viable cells were purified using Lympholite M gradient (Cedarlane). Alternatively, thymocytes were washed and resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 5 million cells in 100 μl, and mixed v/v with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 240 μm of the cytoplasmic cell tracker dye CM-orange (5-(and-6)-4-chloromethyl-benzoylamino tetramethylrhodamine) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After 2 min of incubation at room temperature, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 25 min followed by a further incubation with fetal calf serum (v/v) for 25 min at 37 °C. Thymocytes labeled with either dye were induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation with 2 μm dexamethasone for 4 h. Under these conditions, about 40–50% of the thymocytes were Annexin V positive and less than 10% of Annexin V positive cells were propidium iodide positive (i.e. necrotic). The thymocytes were washed once and overlayed (at 500,000 cells/well in 300 μl of growth medium) on LR73 cells. Routinely, the assays were carried out in duplicates or triplicates for each condition with a 50-min incubation for thymocytes and a 2-h incubation for beads. The wells were then aspirated and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells on the plate were trypsinized, resuspended in cold medium (with 0.2% sodium azide), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Unengulfed thymocytes were gated out by their forward and side scatter. Routinely, 10,000–20,000 events were collected and the data analyzed using CellQuest software. The controls included the use of live thymocytes (not treated with dexamethasone) and apoptotic thymocytes incubated with LR73 cells at 4 °C. Although we trypsinized the cells prior to analysis, the FACS assay cannot distinguish between fluorescence derived from bound versus engulfed thymocytes. However, as determined by confocal microscopy, the majority of the fluorescent phagocytes scored in the FACS assay represents cells that have engulfed the thymocytes or are in the process of engulfment (data not shown). For engulfment assays with 2 or 0.1 μm carboxylate-modified beads (Sigma), indicative of phagocytosis and pinocytosis, respectively, the beads were incubated with cells for 2 h, washed extensively, and analyzed as described above. Forward scatter was used to gate out the unbound beads. To test the involvement of Rho family GTPases,Clostridium difficile toxin B (provided by Dr. Chang Hahn, University of Virginia) was preincubated with the phagocytes at 10 ng/ml for 15 min and was present throughout the engulfment assay. Genetic studies in C. elegans have indicated a role for the CED-2 orthologue CrkII in the removal of apoptotic bodies (19Reddien P.W. Horvitz H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). To test the role of Crk proteins in engulfment in mammalian cells, we overexpressed Myc-tagged CrkII in the phagocytic LR73 cell line. Stable LR73 clones expressing various levels of CrkII proteins (Crk-LR73) were established. Compared with parental LR73 cells, Crk-LR73 cells had an increased uptake of apoptotic cells when the ratio of apoptotic versus live cell uptake was assessed (an increase of 1.5–2-fold in four independent experiments, p ≤ 0.01) (Fig.1 a). CrkII-overexpressing cells also showed an enhanced uptake of 2 μm carboxylate-modified latex beads, which are thought to mimic the negative charge on dying cells and have been used previously as a surrogate for apoptotic cells (33Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 34Albert M.L. Pearce S.F. Francisco L.M. Sauter B. Roy P. Silverstein R.L. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). The increased phagocytosis was specific, as there was no detectable difference between parental and Crk-LR73 cells in the uptake of Escherichia coli (Fig. 1 b) or 0.1 μm beads (indicative of pinocytosis) (data not shown). An analysis of multiple clones expressing different levels of wt CrkII showed a roughly dose-dependent increase in engulfment of 2 μm carboxylate-modified beads (2–5-fold in 10 independent experiments) (Fig. 2 a). The primary flow cytometry data from the engulfment assay that was used to generate the bar graphs are shown also in Fig. 2 a (bottom panel). This enhancement in phagocytosis was specific for wt CrkII overexpression, as stable clones expressing glutathione S-transferase or another adapter protein, Shc, did not show enhanced phagocytosis (data not shown; see also in Fig. 4).Figure 2CrkII overexpression causes a roughly dose-dependent increase in uptake. a, six different Crk-LR73 clones expressing different levels of the CrkII protein were analyzed for engulfment of 2 μm beads as described in the legend for Fig. 1 b. The expression of Myc-tagged CrkII was analyzed by immunoblotting (middle panel). We often see two bands for c-Myc CrkII with the less intense upper band corresponding to a phosphorylated form (data not shown). The primary data obtained by flow cytometry to derive the data presented in thebar graphs is also shown (bottom panel). In the histograms, in the gate setting to determine the percentage of cells containing engulfed particles, we excluded the sharp first peak as it was seen even in the presence of azide, suggesting that this may reflect binding rather than internalization (see data in Fig.2 b below). b, to distinguish whether the enhanced engulfment seen was due to greater binding or internalization, parental LR73 or Crk-LR73 cells were incubated with 2 μm carboxylate beads in the presence or absence of 1% sodium azide at 4 °C or 37 °C. Compared with cells incubated at 4 °C, the greater percentage of fluorescent cells at 37 °C in the presence of azide is considered to reflect cells with bound fluorescent beads, whereas incubation at 37 °C without azide reflects both binding and internalization. The primary flow cytometric data is presented below the bar graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4CrkII-mediated enhancement of phagocytosis depends on functional Rac proteins. a, parental or Crk-LR73 cells (clones #32 and #1 shown in Fig. 2 a, high and low expressing clones, respectively) were incubated withC. difficile toxin B (10 ng/ml final) for 15 min before incubation with 2 μm carboxylate beads. b, LR73 cells were transiently transfected, in duplicates, with an EGFP plasmid along with CrkII, Rac1L61, and Rac1N17. 24 h post-transfection the cells were analyzed for engulfment as described under ”Experimental Procedures“ using 2 μm carboxylate-modified beads. The percentage of GFP positive cells ranged from 20–30% in the individual transfections. Within these GFP positive cells, the fraction that became ”double positive“ because of uptake of the red beads is expressed as a percentage after normalizing for transfection efficiency. c, LR73 cells transiently transfected (in duplicates) with plasmids encoding either Shc (control) or Rac1N17 along with an EGFP marker plasmid were tested for the engulfment of CM-orange-labeled apoptotic thymocytes by flow cytometry as described under ”Experimental Procedures.“ The percent uptake between samples was normalized for transfection efficiency (as determined by the % of GFP positive cells), and the uptake by the control Shc-transfected cells was set at 100%. The Rac1N17 data presented here represent the mean ± S.D. for two independent experiments (the S.D. is not visible, as it was too small). d, LR73 cells were transiently transfected in duplicates with an EGFP plasmid in different combinations with CrkII, Rac1L61, Rac1N17, RhoN19, and Shc plasmids and analyzed as described for panel b.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the enhanced uptake due to CrkII expression reflects increased binding or internalization, we measured the engulfment in the presence of sodium azide (Fig. 2 b). Because phagocytosis is an energy-dependent process, we expected that incubation with azide would still allow binding without the subsequent internalization. For both parental LR73 and Crk-LR73 cells, compared with incubation at 4 °C, we could clearly detect “binding” in the presence of azide at 37 °C. However, the difference in binding between these two cell populations was minimal, whereas there was a much greater uptake by the Crk-LR73 cells than by parental cells at 37 °C without azide. This suggested that the increased uptake by CrkII overexpressing cells is primarily because of enhanced internalization. The primary flow cytometry data used to obtain the bar graphs are presented in the bottom panel of Fig.2 b. CrkII is composed of one Src homology 2 (SH2) and two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (Fig. 3). We compared the engulfment by LR73 cells stably expressing either wt CrkII or CrkII carrying mutations in either the SH2 domain (R38V) or the first SH3 domain (W169L), the latter being implicated in Dock180 binding (Fig.3). Although LR73 clones expressing the lowest levels of Myc-tagged wt CrkII still enhanced engulfment, this was not seen with LR73 expressing the highest levels of the mutants. There was no difference between LR73 cells expressing wt and mutant CrkII when assessed for uptake of 0.1 μm beads (data not shown). It is possible that both the SH2 and the first SH3 domain of CrkII are critical for Crk recruitment/function in this system and that mutation of either domain may render the protein functionally inactive and may explain the lack of enhancement or inhibition with either mutant. Genetic studies using Drosophila Myoblast city (a homologue of CED-5/Dock180) and overexpression studies in 293T cells have indicated that CrkII binds to Dock180 via its SH3 domain and that overexpression of Crk and Dock180 can enhance the formation of GTP-bound Rac, leading to cytoskeletal reorganization (26Nolan K.M. Barrett K. Lu Y. Hu K.Q. Vincent S. Settleman J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3337-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In wt Crk-LR73 cells, as expected, the immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged CrkII co-precipitated Dock180 (data not shown). When we attempted to generate Dock180-overexpressing cell lines to test the role of Dock180 in engulfment, we were unable to obtain clones expressing good levels of Dock180 protein. To determine whether the enhanced phagocytosis due to CrkII overexpression is a result of Crk signaling via Rac1, we examined the effect of C. difficile toxin B, which has been shown to inactivate Rho family GTPases including Rac1 (35Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Toxin B treatment abolished the engulfment by parental as well as Crk-LR73 cells (Fig.4 a). To directly test the role of Rac, we transiently transfected LR73 cells with plasmids coding for CrkII, the constitutively active Rac1L61, or the dominant negative Rac1N17. In all cases, we cotransfected a plasmid coding for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker for transfected cells. We then examined the engulfment of “red”-labeled 2 μm carboxylate beads by the GFP positive “green” cells and scored the percentage of “double positive” cells within the transfected population by flow cytometry. Compared with GFP only transfected cells, transient expression of CrkII enhanced the engulfment of carboxylate-modified beads by about 4-fold, whereas Rac L61 increased the uptake by 3–4-fold (Fig. 4 b). Under the same conditions, the expression of Rac1N17 inhibited the uptake to about 50% of the GFP control transfection (representative of three independent experiments). Similarly, when LR73 cells transiently transfected with Rac1N17 and GFP marker were tested for their ability to take up CM-orange-labeled apoptotic thymocytes, there was a significant decrease in the uptake of dying cells compared with control plasmid transfected cells (Fig.4 c). Under the same conditions, as seen in stable transfectants (Fig. 1 a), Crk overexpression had an increased uptake of dead cells (170% compared with Shc; data not shown). These data suggested that functional endogenous Rac proteins are important for basal engulfment of apoptotic cells. We then tested whether the increased uptake due to Crk overexpression would also be sensitive to inhibition by Rac1N17 coexpression. The N17Rac1 inhibited the Crk-mediated enhancement, suggesting that Rac1 functions downstream of CrkII in this process (Fig. 4 d). In contrast, expression of the dominant negative form of Rho (RhoN19) along with CrkII did not inhibit Crk-mediated enhanced uptake. Moreover, under these conditions, expression of another adapter protein, Shc, did not increase the uptake or affect the RacL61- or CrkII-mediated enhanced engulfment (Fig. 4 d). The data presented here indicate that the adapter protein CrkII, through a pathway that involves the downstream signaling via Rac, regulates engulfment of apoptotic cells. Together with the genetic studies in the worm, the data presented here suggest that CrkII and Rac proteins play an evolutionarily conserved role in the clearance of apoptotic cells. The enhancement of engulfment due to wt CrkII overexpression suggests that this signaling pathway may be one of the rate-limiting steps. It was surprising to us that the CrkII proteins with a mutation in either the SH2 domain or the first SH3 domain failed to function as a dominant negative in engulfment. One possibility is that both the SH2 and the first SH3 domain of CrkII may be critical for Crk recruitment/function and that mutation of either domain may render the protein “null.” This likelihood may explain the lack of enhancement or failure of inhibition of the basal engulfment due to expression of either mutant. At present, the receptor(s) that function upstream of CrkII during phagocytosis is not precisely known. Genetic studies in C. elegans have not identified a receptor in the second complementation group of genes (which encode the Crk, Dock180, and Rac orthologues). Because some members of the integrin family of surface receptors have been shown to signal via Crk (25Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 36Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Crit Rev Oncog. 1997; 8: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the potential role of an integrin receptor functioning upstream of CrkII during engulfment seems plausible. During the review of this manuscript, Albert et al. (37Albert M. Kim J. Birge R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) reported that αvβ5 integrin may play a role in signaling upstream of Crk during engulfment of apoptotic cells. Moreover, using a model system of HEK 293T cells as phagocytes, these authors observed that overexpression of CrkII caused a decreased uptake of apoptotic cells. Whether the discrepancy between our results and those of Albert et al. reflects the different cell types being used as phagocytes, or perhaps the much greater overexpression of transfected plasmids achievable in T antigen-expressing 293T cells compared with LR73 cells, remains to be determined. Nevertheless, both sets of data implicate a function for CrkII-mediated signaling during engulfment. Our observations that Rac overexpression alone can enhance engulfment and that CrkII-mediated enhanced uptake is inhibited by dominant negative RacN17 expression are consistent with the genetic studies in the worm, where the deficiency of cell corpse removal inced-2 (crk)-deficient animals was rescued byced-10 (rac) overexpression. Interestingly, we also observe that CrkII, Dock180, and Rac proteins can localize to the glycosphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains referred to as lipid rafts (data not shown). Moreover, the disruption of lipid rafts inhibited the engulfment of apoptotic cells. 2A.–C. Tosello-Trampont and K. S. Ravichandran, manuscript in preparation. Because actin polymerization has been linked to the lipid rafts, and occurs downstream of the CrkII/Dock180/Rac proteins, our working hypothesis is that engagement of the engulfment receptor(s) prelocalized or recruited to these microdomains may lead to the initiation of signaling events via the Crk/Dock180/Rac signaling pathway. In turn, through already known or yet to be defined Rac effectors, this could lead to a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and facilitate engulfment. Testing this model and defining the specific localization of molecules during engulfment of apoptotic cells might lead to a better understanding of the molecular details of this fundamentally important biological process.

In the central nervous system, 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity controls the amount of a potent neurosteroid, 3α-tetrahydroprogesterone (also called allopregnanolone), which serves as an allosteric regulator of all γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and potentiates γ-aminobutyric acid mediated chloride conductance (1Penning T.M.

In addition to the different subcellular localization, cytosolic and microsomal enzymes appear to have a distinctively different cofactor preference. Cytosolic 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases exhibit a preference for the phosphorylated nucleotides as cofactors (NADP+/NADPH), whereas microsomal enzymes prefer NAD+/NADH (2Verhoeven G. Heyns W.

Because the predominant forms of nucleotide cofactors in the cells are NAD+ and NADPH, it is generally believed that the NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases function mainly in the oxidative direction, whereas the NADPH-dependent enzymes function as reductases (12Labrie F. Luu-The V. Lin S.-X. Labrie C. Simard J. Breton R. Belanger A. Steroids. 1997; 62: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Thus, the balance between the oxidative and reductive activities will determine the local concentrations of bioactive compounds in specific tissues. To date, at least four types of cytosolic 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs)1 have been identified in humans (1Penning T.M. Pawlowski J.E. Schlegel B.P. Jez J.M. Lin H.K. Hoog S.S. Bennett M.J.

All four cytosolic enzymes, named AKR1C1-AKR1C4, are members of the aldo-ketoreductase gene superfamily and prefer NADPH as cofactor (13Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.F. Lin H.K. Ma H.

Extrahepatic tissues such as lung, prostate, uterus, mammary gland, brain, small intestine, and testis vary significantly in their composition and relative amounts of individual isoforms (13Penning T.M.

In contrast to cytosolic 3α-HSDs, these membrane-bound short chain dehydrogenases exhibit a strong preference for NAD+ as cofactor. Previously, we characterized the properties of two human microsomal short chain dehydrogenases that are capable of oxidizing 3α-androstanediol to 5α-dihydrotestosterone and allopregnanolone to 5α-dihydroprogesterone (20Gough W.H.

Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The range of potential physiological substrates for these enzymes (RoDH-4 and RoDH-like 3α-HSD) is not limited to 3α-hydroxysteroids because they can also oxidize all-trans-retinol and might contribute to the biosynthesis of a potent morphogen, all-trans-retinoic acid (20Gough W.H.

Chai X. Eriksson U. Napoli J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Rdh5 was found to localize on the lumenal side of the endoplasmic reticulum (23Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A.L. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was implicated in the biosynthesis of 11-cis-retinal (24Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the cofactor for vision, and 9-cis-retinoic acid, the activating ligand for retinoid X receptors (25Mertz J.R. Shang E.

The three human retinol/sterol dehydrogenases share ∼50% amino acid sequence identity, similar genomic structure, and chromosomal localization on chromosome 12 (26–28). Individual enzymes exhibit distinctively different tissue distribution patterns. RoDH-4 is primarily expressed in human liver and skin (20Gough W.H. Van Ooteghem S. Sint T. Kedishvili N.Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), spinal cord (21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem.

Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Rdh5 appears to be ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of tissues: liver, mammary gland, colon, thymus, small intestine, kidney, and others. (16Wang J. Chai X. Eriksson U. Napoli J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,25Mertz J.R. Shang E. Piantedosi R. Wei S. Wolgemuth D.J. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11744-11749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Remarkably, liver contains the highest levels of mRNAs for all three enzymes. Here, we report molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. We show that, in contrast to the previously identified enzymes, this human 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase is not active toward retinoids and exhibits different membrane topology as well as different tissue distribution.DISCUSSIONThe novel 3α-HSD characterized in the present study exhibits less than 50% amino acid sequence identity to any known protein. It is most closely related to retinol/sterol dehydrogenases of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Furthermore, the gene for 3α-HSD shares similar structural organization with the genes for retinol/sterol dehydrogenases (28Kedishvili N.Y. Belyaeva O.V. Gough W.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 130: 457-467Google Scholar). Some variation is observed in the length of exon 5, which is 1 amino acid longer that the corresponding exon in the Rdh5 gene and 2 amino acids longer than that in the RoDH-4 and RoDH-like 3α-HSD genes. Interestingly, 3α-HSD gene is found on a different chromosome and does not appear to have satellite pseudogenes like RoDH-4 and RoDH-like 3α-HSD genes (28Kedishvili N.Y. Belyaeva O.V. Gough W.H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 130: 457-467Google Scholar), which might indicate that it appeared later in evolution.Analysis of the sequences deposited in the GenBankTMexpressed sequence tag data base showed that cDNA fragments identical to different segments of 3α-HSD cDNA were isolated from multiple sources: lymph node (nine reports), testis (three reports), normal colon and colon adenocarcinoma (three reports), cervical tumor (one report), breast (one report), uterus and endometrial adenocarcinoma (four reports), fetal lung (one report), pancreas adenocarcinoma (two reports), and lymphoma (one report). Thus, 3α-HSD appears to exhibit wide tissue distribution. Indeed, Northern blot analysis of human tissues revealed that 3α-HSD mRNA is present in the central nervous system and in a number of peripheral endocrine tissues. Interestingly, the size of the predominant mRNA species varied depending on the tissue source, suggesting that there might be a tissue-specific splicing of 3α-HSD mRNA. In fact, we found that the 113-nucleotide segment inserted in the 5′-untranslated sequence of a nearly identical clone submitted under the name of retinol dehydrogenase homolog isoform-2 (AF240697) is located within the 11,805-base pair sequence of putative intron 1. This observation suggests that alternatively spliced products may exist.The most striking difference in the distribution pattern of the novel 3α-HSD compared with that of retinol/sterol dehydrogenases is that the 3α-HSD message is practically absent in liver. The lack of hybridization with the liver mRNA serves as a confirmation that the cDNA probe does not cross-hybridize with either RoDH-4 or RoDH-like 3α-HSD mRNA, both of which are very abundant in the liver.The presence of 3α-HSD in the brain is consistent with its activity toward allopregnanolone, which serves as a potent allosteric regulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Allopregnanolone is likely to be produced in the brain by cytosolic 3α-HSDs, AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, which catalyze the reduction of the 3-ketone group on dihydroprogesterone (13Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C.F. Lin H.K. Ma H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The back-oxidation of allopregnanolone to dihydroprogesterone is thought to be catalyzed by an unidentified membrane-bound NAD+-dependent 3α-HSD (4Krause J.E. Karavolas H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11807-11814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Krause J.E. Karavolas H.J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1981; 14: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Previously, we have reported that RoDH-like 3α-HSD is capable of oxidizing allopregnanolone and is expressed in various regions of the human brain and in the spinal cord (21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may function as allopregnanolone dehydrogenase in the central nervous system. This study shows that, in addition to RoDH-like 3α-HSD, the central nervous system contains a second isoform of microsomal oxidative 3α-HSD active toward allopregnanolone. Interestingly, similar to RoDH-like 3α-HSD (21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Huang X.F. Luu-The V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29452-29457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the newly characterized enzyme exhibits “epimerase” activity toward allopregnanolone, slowly converting it to 3β-hydroxysteroid isopregnanolone in the presence of NAD+. We have previously proposed that NADH, which is produced during oxidation of allopregnanolone, might be retained in the active site and trigger the nonstereospecific reduction of the 3-ketone group on dihydroprogesterone to both a 3α-hydroxyl and a 3β-hydroxyl group. Consistent with this hypothesis, the new 3α-HSD exhibits a higher affinity for NADH than for NAD+ (the apparent Km value is 9 versus 72 μm), similar to RoDH-like 3α-HSD (0.18versus 1.9 μm) (21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). At the same time, RoDH-4, which has almost identical Km values for NAD+ (0.13 μm) and NADH (0.1 μm), does not seem to possess the epimerase activity. 2S. V. Chetyrkin, and N. Y. Kedishvili, unpublished observations. It should also be noted that, in addition to allopregnanolone, RoDH-like 3α-HSD epimerized androsterone into epiandrosterone. However, we did not observe epimerization of androsterone with the new 3α-HSD, possibly due to the 5-fold higher apparent Km value of the enzyme for androsterone compared with allopregnanolone.Besides utilizing allopregnanolone as substrate, the new 3α-HSD is equally efficient at converting 3α-androstanediol into a potent androgen, dihydrotestosterone. This is consistent with the expression of the enzyme in testis and prostate. Previously, Biswas and Russell (15Biswas M.G. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) proposed that RoDH-like 3α-HSD, which is expressed in prostate and testis, contributes to the back-oxidation of 3α-androstanediol to dihydrotestosterone in these tissues. This study shows that, in addition to RoDH-like 3α-HSD, dihydrotestosterone can be produced in testis and prostate by the novel isoform of 3α-HSD.Similar to retinol/sterol dehydrogenases, 3α-HSD is an integral membrane protein. Therefore, depending on its transmembrane topology, the active site of the enzyme may be exposed either to the cytosol or to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. This, in turn, may affect its access to the substrates and cofactors. Previous analysis of the transmembrane topology of Rdh5, which was proposed to catalyze the biosynthesis of 11-cis-retinaldehyde in retinal pigment epithelium, showed that Rdh5 is anchored to the membranes of smooth endoplasmic reticulum by two hydrophobic peptide segments (23Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A.L. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of this enzyme is confined to the lumenal compartment, suggesting that generation of 11-cis-retinaldehyde occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (23Simon A. Romert A. Gustafson A.L. McCaffery J.M. Eriksson U. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 549-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Rdh5, 3α-HSD appears to be facing the cytosolic side of the membrane, indicating that it will utilize the cytosolic pool of steroids and nucleotides. In the liver cytosol, and presumably in other tissues, the NAD+:NADH ratio is about 1000, whereas the NADP+:NADPH ratio is about 0.01 (33Veech R.L. Eggleston L.V. Krebs H.A. Biochem. J. 1969; 115: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This suggests that the NAD+-preferring oxidoreductases, which face the cytosol like the new 3α-HSD, will function in the oxidative direction. The available substrate and cofactor pool for the lumenally oriented Rdh5, which also prefers NAD+ over NADP+ as cofactor (34Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), is less clear.The existence of enzymes that share similar substrates but exhibit different transmembrane orientation is not unusual. For example, two other members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, 11β-HSD type 1 and type 2, which catalyze the interconversion between a potent glucocorticoid cortisol and a weak glucocorticoid cortisone, exhibit opposite transmembrane orientation: 11β-HSD type 1 is a lumenally oriented glycoprotein, whereas 11β-HSD type 2 faces the cytosol (32Odermatt A. Arnold P. Stauffer A. Frey B.M. Frey F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28762-28770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two enzymes exhibit a different cofactor preference: 11β-HSD type 1 catalyzes oxidation and reduction using NADP(H) as cofactor, whereas 11β-HSD type 2 is NAD+-specific and catalyzes only 11β-dehydrogenation. This is in contrast to Rdh5 and 3α-HSD, which both appear to exhibit a cofactor preference for NAD+.Besides the difference in the transmembrane topology and tissue distribution, 3α-HSD exhibits different substrate specificity compared with Rdh5 and the all-trans-retinol-oxidizing microsomal dehydrogenases, RoDH-4 and RoDH-like 3α-HSD. Rdh5 has similar affinity for retinoids (K0.5 of 6.3–6.6 μm for 9-cis and 11-cis-retinol) and 3α-androstanediol (K0.5 of 6.4 μm) (16Wang J. Chai X. Eriksson U. Napoli J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and is about two times more efficient as retinol dehydrogenase than as a steroid dehydrogenase. RoDH-4 and RoDH-like 3α-HSD occupy an intermediate position and are more efficient as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases with apparent Km values of ∼0.2 μmfor 3α-hydroxysteroids (20Gough W.H. Van Ooteghem S. Sint T. Kedishvili N.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19778-19785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) while retaining the retinol-oxidizing capacity (Km value of 3.2 μm) (21Chetyrkin S.V. Hu J. Gough W.H. Dumaual N. Kedishvili N.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 386: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The new 3α-HSD is practically inactive with retinoid compounds and is most efficient as allopregnanolone and 3α-androstanediol dehydrogenase, representing the opposite end of the spectrum. Thus, experimental data obtained in this study suggest that the new member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily is a novel type of microsomal NAD+-dependent 3α-HSD with unique tissue distribution, transmembrane topology, and catalytic properties. Oxidation and reduction of hydroxyl and ketone groups in position 3 on naturally occurring steroids play an important role in regulation of intracellular levels of biologically active steroid hormones. For example, in gonads, 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity is responsible for maintaining the balance between a potent androgen, 5α-dihydrotestosterone, with a ketone group in position 3 and a weak androgen, 3α-androstanediol, which has a hydroxyl group in the same position (Fig. 1; reviewed in Ref. 1Penning T.M.

In the central nervous system, 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase activity controls the amount of a potent neurosteroid, 3α-tetrahydroprogesterone (also called allopregnanolone), which serves as an allosteric regulator of all γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and potentiates γ-aminobutyric acid mediated chloride conductance (1Penning T.M.

In addition to the different subcellular localization, cytosolic and microsomal enzymes appear to have a distinctively different cofactor preference.

The corresponding gene is imprinted maternally through an unknown mechanism and maps to 6q24–q25, within the minimal interval harboring the gene responsible for transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM) and a tumor suppressor gene involved in breast cancer. Because of its functional properties, imprinting status, and expression pattern in mammary cell lines and tumors,ZAC is the best candidate so far for both disease conditions. In the present work, we delineated ZAC genomic organization and mapped its transcriptional start site. It is noteworthy that the ZAC promoter localized to the CpG island harboring the methylation imprint associated with TNDM and methylation of this promoter silenced its activity. These data indicate that the methylation mark may have a direct effect on the silencing of the ZAC imprinted allele. Our findings further strengthen the hypothesis that ZAC is the gene responsible for TNDM and suggest a novel mechanism for ZAC inactivation in breast tumors.

Moreover, imprinted genes are frequently involved in developmental processes, and loss of imprinting results in a disease condition in many cases (2Falls J.G. Pulford D.J. Wylie A.A. Jirtle R.L. Am.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 275-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)), and the mechanisms underlying imprinting are as yet poorly understood. Recently, a novel imprinted locus was mapped to human chromosome 6q24–q25 by different strategies. Kamiya and co-workers (3Kamiya M. Judson H. Okazaki Y. Kusakabe M. Muramatsu M. Takada S. Takagi N.

It is a developmental disease of insulin production (5Haig D. Nat.

Most TNDM cases are sporadic, but familial cases also exist. The heritable forms of the disease are paternally inherited (8Coffey Jr., J.D. Killelea D.E. Am. J. Dis.

These findings strongly suggest that TNDM results from the overexpression of a paternally expressed, maternally imprinted gene on chromosome 6q. Using polymorphic markers and linkage analysis, the gene responsible for TNDM was localized between markers D6S308 and D6S310 (19Gardner R.J. Mungall A.J. Dunham I. Barber J.C.K. Shield J.P.H.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Further studies identified a minimal region containing the gene responsible for TNDM (4Gardner R.J. Mackay D.J.G. Mungall A.J. Polychronakos C. Siebert R. Shield J.P.H. Temple I.K. Robinson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The TNDM locus is 550 kb in length and harbors several CpG islands, of which one (CpG2) is methylated on the maternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal one (4Gardner R.J. Mackay D.J.G. Mungall A.J. Polychronakos C. Siebert R. Shield J.P.H. Temple I.K. Robinson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 2D. J. G. Mackay, unpublished observation. The importance of this CpG island in the etiology of TNDM is further underlined by the discovery that a limited number of patients do not display cytogenetic alterations but rather a defect in the methylation pattern of CpG2 (4Gardner R.J. Mackay D.J.G. Mungall A.J. Polychronakos C. Siebert R. Shield J.P.H. Temple I.K. Robinson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). ZAC, encoding a novel zinc finger protein recently isolated in this laboratory (see below) is localized in this region, and Kamiya and co-workers (3Kamiya M. Judson H. Okazaki Y. Kusakabe M. Muramatsu M. Takada S. Takagi N. Arima T. Wake N. Kamimura K. Satomura K. Hermann R. Bonthron D.T. Hayashizaki Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) have demonstrated thatZAC is maternally imprinted in several fetal and adult tissues. Its functional properties (induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis) are compatible with a role in development and differentiation, and we hypothesized that overexpression ofZAC may be responsible for TNDM. We recently reported the cloning and functional characterization ofZAC, which encodes a novel zinc finger protein inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (21Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journot L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C.

Interestingly,ZAC/LOT1 was found to map to 6q24–q25 (22Varrault A. Ciani E. Apiou F. Bilanges B. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), a chromosomal region known to harbor a tumor suppressor gene for many types of solid tumors, including breast and ovary tumors and melanoma (26Mertens F. Johansson B. Höglund M. Mitelman F. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2765-2780PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its functional properties, chromosomal localization, and loss of expression in a model of cell transformation, we hypothesized that ZAC may be the tumor suppressor gene on 6q24. ZAC is not inactivated according to the two-hit hypothesis proposed by Knudson (38Knudson A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10914-10921Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) for the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene. In contrast, we showed that ZAC is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells and that 60% of mammary tumor-derived cell lines display a complete loss of ZACexpression (27Bilanges B. Varrault A. Basyuk E. Rodriguez C. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Theillet C. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The remaining 40% of mammary epithelial cell lines as well as some unselected primary breast tumor samples displayed a down-regulation of ZAC expression. Interestingly,ZAC expression could be reinduced by treatment of some cell lines with azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, indicating that methylation of the ZAC promoter may critically regulate its expression. In this context, we undertook the isolation and characterization of ZAC gene to elucidate its imprinting mechanism and pave the way for future studies aimed at testing the actual involvement of this gene in TNDM and breast cancer. Rapid amplification of the ZAC cDNA 5′ end was performed from placenta poly(A)+ RNA using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that RT was performed with ZAC-specific primers: 5′-GTTGGGGTCGTGGGTCTGG-3′ and 5′-GTCCTTCTTCCCACACTCCTCACAC-3′. RT products were amplified with AP1 primer and different ZAC-specific primers: R1 (5′-GCCATTTAAGCACAAACAGAACGAT-3′), R3 (5′-TGACAGGGAACATCTGCTGCGA-GG-3′), R5 (5′-TGGTCCCATTAGGTTTCTGTCG3-′), R6 (5′-TAAGTGAGGTACAGATGAGTTTCAGATGTG-3′), and R7 (5′-CGTCCGTCCGTCCGTC-3′) using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (CLONTECH). For AP1-R1 and AP1-R2 primer pairs, a nested PCR was subsequently performed with AP2 and R2 (5′-TATAGCTGGGGCATGTCCTGGGTCC3-′), or R4 (5′-GACCGAGTCCTCCCAGAAGTTTGTC-3′), respectively (see Fig. 1 for primer locations). PCR products were digested with NotI, subcloned into pBS (NotI-EcoRV), and sequenced. Total RNAs were prepared from mammoplasty reduction tissues, cell lines, and placental tissues (23Bilanges B. Varrault A. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Hoffmann A. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pituitary gland poly(A)+ RNA, human fetal liver, and human kidney total RNAs were from CLONTECH, and human total ovary RNA were from Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). RPA was performed as previously described (27Bilanges B. Varrault A. Basyuk E. Rodriguez C. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Theillet C. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The RPA antisense ZAC probe was made by T7 in vitro transcription of pBS-3′5′-876 (see below) digested with NheI. A positivein vitro T3 transcript sense control was made from the same plasmid digested with NotI. 50 μg of total RNA or 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were hybridized overnight at 56 °C with 2 fmol of gel-purified antisense ZAC probe and treated with RNase A/T1. Protected fragments were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. RT was performed from 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA or 1 μg of total RNA with random primers as described previously. 30 cycles of PCR were performed on 0.2 (pituitary) or 2 μl (other tissues) of RT product using P1 (5′-GCAGCCGTGCTCACAGCTCAG-3′) and P2 (5′-CCAAAGGCCATTTTGTTGGGGTCG-3′) oligos (see Fig. 1 for primer locations). Bands were agarose gel-purified, subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), and sequenced. Breast cancer cell lines CAL-51 and MDA-MB453 were grown in DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by electroporation with 2 μg of plasmid DNA for 3 × 106 cells, and a luciferase assay was performed as described previously (21Spengler D. Villalba M. Hoffmann A. Pantaloni C. Houssami S. Bockaert J. Journot L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) using β-galactosidase to standardize for transfection efficiency. Details on the construction of the different plasmids are available upon request. A SmaI-StuI 876-bp fragment corresponding to PAC 340H11 nt 53704–52829 was isolated from a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) genomic clone (23Bilanges B. Varrault A. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Hoffmann A. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and subcloned into a pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) in sense (5′3′-876) and antisense (3′5′-876) orientations relative toZAC. From the SmaI site, serial deletions were performed either by restriction digestions or PCR (in this case, inserts were sequence-verified). pGL3–5′3′-876 plasmid was in vitro methylated withSssI (CpG methylase, which nonspecifically methylates all CpG dinucleotides) or AluI methylase (which methylates at AluI sites) from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The efficiency of in vitro methylation was confirmed by resistance to cleavage by the methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (NotI and HpaI for SssI methylation and AluI for AluI methylation; not shown). We also checked that methylase treatments did not induce any alteration of the plasmid DNAs other than epigenetic; bacteria-transformed methylated DNAs had a promoter activity as strong as their nonmethylated counterparts (not shown). The mechanism responsible for ZACimprinting has not yet been determined. The minimal region for TNDM is covered by clones 468K18, 340H11, 197L1, 3B11, 83M4, and 91J24. Sequence examination revealed the presence of several CpG islands of which one (CpG2) is differentially methylated on the paternal and maternal alleles (4Gardner R.J. Mackay D.J.G. Mungall A.J. Polychronakos C. Siebert R. Shield J.P.H. Temple I.K. Robinson D.O. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).2 Until now, the isolated most 5′ exon of ZAC was located ∼70 kb centromeric from CpG2. In the present report, we used the 5′ RACE technique to isolate theZAC most 5′ exons. Using primers annealing to exon IX or VII, we could extend the 5′ ZAC sequence through different exons to a CpG-rich region (Exon I). We determined the exon/intron organization of the ZAC gene by aligning the sequences of the RACE clones with NT002260 assembled from PACs 197L1, 340H11, and 468K18. The ZAC gene comprises 9 exons, with exon VIII harboring the translation start site (Fig.1). This gene organization was confirmed by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from different tissues including mammary gland and pancreas using primers in exon I and IX (Fig.2). In addition, alternative splicing of exons II, IV, V, and VIII and the use of alternative splice sites for exons IV and VII were detected. Despite the significant abundance of the various alternatively spliced isoforms of the ZAC 5′ untranslated region, their relevance remains elusive at this point. By contrast, we recently showed that splicing of exon VIII (first coding exon) modulates the functional properties of the corresponding translation products (23Bilanges B. Varrault A. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Hoffmann A. Bockaert J. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Of the 50 RACE clones sequenced, 35 were incomplete, but 15 had their 5′ ends into CpG2. There were three groups of those RACE clones: 7 were incomplete and had very short 5′ ends extending only 10–50 nt into exon I, 7 extended between nt 52937 and 52907 of 340H11, and 1 RACE clone (the longest) extended to nt 53070 of 340H11 (note that ZAC is antisense to 340H11). It was impossible to further extend this 5′ end by using primers annealing to exon IV, III, or I. During the course of this study, Hamilton's group (25Abdollahi A. Roberts D. Godwin A.K. Schultz D.C. Sonoda G. Testa J.R. Hamilton T.C. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) corrected the sequence of the human LOT1/ZAC sequence (U72621), which now extends into the same CpG island to nt 52879 of 340H11. To determine the 5′ boundary of exon I, we performed RNase protection assays using a probe corresponding to nt 52829–53306 of 340H11, covering part of exon I on its 5′ end. Pituitary and mammary gland RNAs gave 2 major protected fragments of 95–105 nt, corresponding to a 5′ end between nt 52934–52925 of 340H11 close to the start sites given by the RACE clones extending to nt 52937–52907 of 340H11 (Fig.3). Two weak, longer protected fragments could be detected around 240–250 nt corresponding to the start site given by the longer RACE clone (nt 53070 of 340H11). No protected fragment was detected in yeast RNA or in RNA from the ZAC non-expressing cell line MDA-MB231. All of these data predicted a length of ZAC cDNAs between 2.9 and 3.6 kb in agreement with the size of the mRNAs we described previously (27Bilanges B. Varrault A. Basyuk E. Rodriguez C. Mazumdar A. Pantaloni C. Bockaert J. Theillet C. Spengler D. Journot L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3979-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).Figure 3Mapping of the ZAC transcription start site. Different RNA preparations from ZAC-expressing (pituitary, mammary gland, CAL-51 mammary cancer cell line) and non-expressing (MDA-MB231 cell line) tissues were used together with yeast RNA negative control and an in vitrosense transcript positive control. Lengths of different probes and control protected fragments used in this experiment, including the ones shown here, are indicated on the left. Hybridization of the probe with pituitary and mammary gland RNAs gave different protected fragments after RNase treatment (indicated byarrowheads): two weak ones around 240–250 nt, corresponding to the longer 5′RACE clone; and two stronger and shorter ones (95–105 nt), corresponding to the sequence of 7 RACE clones. Interestingly, CAL-51 RNA gave the same long weak protected fragments but only one of the two shorter ones (105 nt).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next investigated whether the region upstream of the potential transcription start sites had a promoter activity. We subcloned a 876-bp genomic fragment corresponding to nt 53704–52829 of 340H11, in sense (5′3′-876) and antisense (3′5′-876) orientations relative to ZAC exons, into the pGL3basic reporter gene. Luciferase activity was measured in CAL-51 (ZAC+ cell line) (not shown) and MDA-MB453 (ZAC− cell line) transfected cell lines. As shown in Fig.4 A, this fragment (5′3′-876) contained a promoter activity directed toward ZAC exons, whereas the fragment in the reverse orientation (3′5′-876) was devoid of such activity. The results in CAL-51 cells were similar, except that pGL3-C had a 4–5-fold higher activity than in MDA-MB453 (105 ± 7-fold induction over pGL3basic) and 5′3′-876 a slightly weaker activity (10 ± 1, compared with the MDA-MB453 value, 30 ± 2) (not shown). Using deletion mutants, we confirmed the RPA experiments by showing that the minimal promoter was located between nt 53020 and 52829 of 340H11 in the minimal 192-bp construct, which includes the potential start sites at nt 52934–52925 of 340H11. This promoter is TATA-less and GC-rich, which is in agreement with the multiple transcription start sites we detected. As we found a promoter activity in CpG2 directed towardZAC, we next investigated whether this promoter activity was modulated by methylation. We used SssI methylase (CpG methylase), which induced the dense methylation of 5′3′-876 (73 Me-C in a CpG context), and AluI methylase, which methylates 5 ctyosine residues in a GpC context. SssI methylation completely abolished the promoter activity of 5′3′-876 in both MDA-MB453 (Fig. 4 B) and CAL-51 cells (not shown) in contrast to AluI methylation, which had no effect (Fig.4 B). Altogether, these data demonstrated that CpG2 contains the promoter controlling ZAC expression and that its activity is negatively modulated by dense methylation of cytosine in the CpG context. Among the different epigenetic modifications involved in imprinting, DNA methylation is particularly relevant, as the great majority of imprinted genes examined so far contain differentially methylated regions (DMRs) on the maternal and paternal alleles (28Barlow D.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6899-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Brannan C.I. Bartolomei M.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 164-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 30Reik W. Walter J. Nature Rev. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref Scopus (1847) Google Scholar). These DMRs have variable locations within different imprinted genes, and their functional role in the silencing of the imprinted allele is not always indisputable. Some DMRs harbor a promoter activity that is regulated by methylation; our data support such a function for the DMR of the TNDM locus. We have shown here that the ZACpromoter resides in this DMR and that in vitro methylation completely abolishes its activity. These data support a model in which the methylation mark on the imprinted maternal allele repressesZAC transcription, whereas the unmethylated CpG2/ZAC promoter drives the expression of the paternal allele. This is the simplest model of methylation-induced monoallelic expression, where the methylation-induced modification of heterochromatin represses gene transcription. A similar mechanism may be postulated for the imprinting of mZac gene, which is also paternally expressed, as a recent study reported that DNA demethylation but not histone deacetylase inhibition reactivatesmZac in uniparental (maternal) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (31El Kharroubi A. Piras G. Stewart C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8674-8680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the 5′ end of mZac resides in a CpG island with maternal allele-specific methylation analogous to the human gene. 3G. Kelsey, personal communication. Other DMRs are involved in establishing differential methylation marks at precise locations within imprinted loci and have been named imprinting centers (ICs) (32Ben-Porah I. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The location of the IC controlling the methylation status of the ZAC promoter remains an open question. Several imprinting models have been described. The expression/competition model is exemplified by theIgf2r locus, where the imprinting center is a DMR located within intron 2. This DMR serves as the promoter for the noncoding antisense Air mRNA and governs the expression of Igf2r (1Vu T.H. Hoffman A.R. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Barlow D.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6899-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Ben-Porah I. Cedar H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The genomic structure we report here for ZAC revealed no DMR located within an intron, excluding a model similar to Igf2r. Another imprinting model follows from the well studied IGF2/H19locus, where DNA methylation controls the activity of an insulator element located between two linked genes, by regulating the binding of the zinc finger protein CTCF (33Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R463-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Reik W. Murrell A. Nature. 2000; 405: 408-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). No consensus CTCF binding site was noted in the PACs around the ZAC locus, excluding this model for ZAC imprinting. Indeed, it could be that the IC governing ZAC imprinting is integral to the DMR/ZAC promoter, that the sequence context of the CpG island induces differential methylation, or that there is a remote IC. The candidate gene for TNDM is located on chromosome 6q24 and is maternally imprinted. To date, CpG2 is the only DMR on this locus. Our demonstration that ZAC is physically associated with CpG2, where its promoter is located, further strengthens the hypothesis that ZAC is the TNDM gene. Furthermore, some TNDM patients have neither paternal UPD6 (uniparental disomy of chromosome6) nor paternal duplication of 6q24 but instead display a methylation defect in CpG2 (35Temple I.K. Gardner R.J. Mackay D.J. Barber J.C. Robinson D.O. Shield J.P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1359-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We can predict that ZACwill be biallelically expressed in these patients. Transgenic mouse models will help to confirm the involvement of ZAC in TNDM. Besides ZAC, the TNDM locus encodes many ESTs, which may correspond to other TNDM candidate genes. One such candidate is HYMAI, a maternally imprinted, apparently noncoding cDNA, which partially overlaps with CpG2, the ZAC promoter and its first exon (36Arima T. Drewell R.A. Oshimura M. Wake N. Surani M.A. Genomics. 2000; 67: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The reported sequence of HYMAI is sense with regard toZAC, but according to the annotations of the ESTs used for its cloning it could be antisense. This issue will have to be addressed to find out whether HYMAI encodes a noncoding antisense RNA, as is observed in several imprinted loci, or whether it is co-linear with ZAC and both genes compete for the same promoter. Because of its antiproliferative properties and chromosomal location, ZAC is a candidate tumor suppressor gene for breast cancer. Provided that ZAC expression is monoallelic in the mammary gland, a single event (the inactivation of the paternally expressed allele) would be sufficient to completely inactivate ZAC, supporting a tumor suppressor function for this gene. The location of the ZAC promoter, which we report here, paves the way for future studies aimed at resolving this important issue.

https://openalex.org/W1602767911,"Elastase activity of Vibrio vulnificus was highly dependent on growth phase, reached a maximum during the stationary phase, and was regulated at the level of transcription. The stationary phase production of elastase incrp or rpoS mutants, which were constructed by allelic exchanges, decreased about 3- and 10-fold, respectively. However, the promoter activity of vvpE encoding elastase was unaffected by those mutations in the log phase when analyzed using a vvpE-lux fusion. A primer extension analysis revealed that the transcription of vvpE begins at two different sites, consisting of putative promoter L (PL) and promoter S (PS). The PL activity was constitutive through the log and stationary phases, lower than the PS activity, and unaffected by the crp orrpoS mutations. The transcription of PS, induced only in the stationary phase, was dependent on RpoS. The mutation incrp reduced the activity of PS; however, the additional inactivation of crp did not influence the PS activity in the rpoS mutant, indicating that CRP exerted its effects through PS requiring RpoS. These results demonstrate thatvvpE expression is differentially directed by PL and PS depending on the growth phase and elevated by RpoS and CRP in the stationary phase.

The pathogenic marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is the causative agent of food-borne diseases, such as life-threatening septicemia and possibly gastroenteritis, in individuals with underlying predisposed conditions. The mortality from septicemia is very high (>50%), and death may occur within 1–2 days after the first signs of illness (1Blake P.A. Weaver R.E. Hollis D.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Several potential virulence factors including an endotoxin, a polysaccharide capsule, iron-sequestering systems, a cytolytic hemolysin, an elastase, a phospholipase A2, and other exotoxins have been identified for V. vulnificus (for a recent review, see Ref. 2Linkous D.A. Oliver J.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the putative virulence factors is an elastolytic metalloprotease. Elastase, with a broad substrate specificity including biologically important host molecules, has been suggested to be an important virulence factor of various human pathogenic bacteria (3Hase C.C. Finkelstein R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 823-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The characteristics of the elastase of V. vulnificusas a potential virulence factor have been studied primarily using the purified protein in animal models (5Kothary M.H. Kreger A.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar, 6Miyoshi S. Nakazawa H. Kawata K. Tomochika K. Tobe K. Shinoda S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4851-4855Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Miyoshi S. Shinoda S. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 32: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Injection of purified elastase reproduced many of the observed aspects of disease caused by V. vulnificus, including dermonecrosis, destruction of tissues, edema, and ulceration. However, when the isogenic mutant deficient in the elastase was compared with the parental strain for virulence, it appeared that elastase is less important in the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus than would have been predicted from examining the effects of administering purified proteins to animals (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Shao C. Hor L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this contradiction is that the expression of vvpE encoding elastase may not be sufficient at least under the conditions used; hence the effects of the inactivation of the vvpE on the virulence of the pathogen were not apparent. This possibility strongly underscores the necessity of understanding the regulation of vvpE expression. However, no promoter(s) of the vvpE gene have been identified, and the molecular mechanisms by which the bacterium modulates the expression of the vvpEgene have not yet been characterized. This lack of information on the regulatory characteristics of the elastase gene makes it difficult to understand how the expression pattern and level of elastase varies spatially and temporally during infection with viable V. vulnificus. Accordingly, the influence of the growth phase on the expression of thevvpE of V. vulnificus was examined in the present study. V. vulnificus isogenic mutants, which lack either the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP, 1The abbreviations used are: CRPcyclic AMP receptor proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)PLpromoter LPSpromoter S a gene product of crp) or both CRP and RpoS (ςs, a gene product of rpoS), were constructed, and the promoter activities of the vvpE in these mutants were then analyzed.

Escherichia coli strains used for plasmid DNA replication or conjugational transfer of plasmids were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on LB broth containing 1.5% (w/v) agar. Unless noted otherwise, V. vulnificus strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl (LBS). When required, appropriate antibiotics were added to the media as follows: 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10 μg/ml tetracycline.Table IPlasmids and bacterial strains used in this studyStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristics 1-aApr, ampicillin-resistant; Kmr, kanamycin-resistant; Tcr, tetracycline-resistant.ReferencesE. coliDH5αsupE44ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZ ΔM15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Laboratory collectionSY327λpirΔ(lac pro)argE(Am) recA56 rpoB λpir; host for π-requiring plasmids12Miller V.L.

Open table in a new tab Cultures of V. vulnificus strains grown at 30 °C under aeration and 5-ml samples were removed at the indicated times for determination of cell density and elastase activity. Growth was monitored by measuring the A600 of the cultures, and measurement of the A600 of the diluted cultures was done once the A was above 0.8. Cultures incubated for 12–16 h (A600 = 1.2) were harvested, and the enzyme activities in the stationary phase were determined according to the procedures described previously (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Averages and S.E. values were calculated from at least three independent determinations. Procedures for the isolation of plasmid DNA and genomic DNA and for transformation were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes were used as recommended by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). Primary DNA cloning and manipulation were conducted in E. coli DH5α, and restriction mapping was used to confirm that transformants contained the appropriate plasmids. PCR amplification of DNA was performed using a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and standard protocols. Plasmid pUC::crp, which carries a V. vulnificuschromosomal DNA fragment of 1.7 kb and contains the entirecrp gene, 2J. H. Rhee, manuscript in preparation. was inactivated in vitro by the insertion of nptIencoding for aminoglycoside 3′-phosphotransferase and conferring resistance to kanamycin (10Oka A. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). For this purpose, aHindIII-SalI fragment of the crp open reading frame from pUC::crp was subcloned into pCVD442 (11Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), forming pKC9964. The 1.2-kb DNA fragment carryingnptI was isolated from pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then inserted into a unique SphI site present within the open reading frame of crp in pKC9964. The resulting construct, pKC9965, is a derivative of pCVD442 and was maintained in E. coli SY327 λpir(12Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). To generate thecrp::nptI mutants in V. vulnificus by homologous recombination (see Fig. 2 A), E. coliSM10 λpir, tra (11Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect.

For the construction of the crp rpoS double mutant, V. vulnificus KP101, an isogenic rpoSmutant of ATCC29307, was used as a recipient. The KP101, in which two thirds of the rpoS open reading frame were deleted, was constructed by replacing rpoS on the chromosome withΔrpoS. 3K.-H. Lee, manuscript in preparation. Conjugation was conducted using methods previously described (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect.

The desired transconjugants that showed a green colony formation on thiosulfate citrate bile salts agar supplemented with kanamycin, maltose (0.5%, w/v), neutral red (30 μg/ml), and sucrose (6%, w/v) were selected. The transconjugants that were ampicillin-sensitive due to the absence of the pKC9965, were confirmed for the presence ofnptI in the crp gene of the mutants by PCR using a pair of primers, CRP9901 (5′-TACCTACTGGCCATGATCGATG-3′) and CRP9902 (5′-CGGAATCTGAGAGGGTTTAGT-3′) (see Fig. 2 B). The V. vulnificus mutants chosen for further analysis were named KC74 for the crp mutant and KC84 for the crp rpoS double mutant. The parent plasmid, pHK0011, carries a 3.2-kbHindIII-BamHI fragment of promoterlessluxAB from Mini-Tn5 luxAB (14DeLorenzo V. Herrero M. Jakubzik U. Timmism K. J.

Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect.

Cultures were grown to log phase (A600 = 0.6) or stationary phase (A600 = 1.2), and then 1-ml samples taken from each culture were diluted 100-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and placed into cuvettes. A decanal stock solution (0.3%, v/v) was prepared by adding decanal to a 1:1 mixture of water and ethanol. After adding 10 μl of the decanal stock solution to cuvettes with the cells, the cellular luminescences were measured with a Lumat model 9501 luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) and expressed using the arbitrary relative light units of the instrument. Total cellular RNAs were isolated in different growth phases using a Trizol reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For a Northern dot blot analysis, a series of reactions was performed according to standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with 20 μg of total RNA. A 1.2-kb HindIII-HindIII DNA probe representing the internal sequences of the vvpE was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for hybridization as described previously (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The blots were visualized and quantified using an image analyzer (BAS1500 model; Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and the TINA (version 2.0) program. Primer extension experiments were carried out with SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to Sambrook et al. (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 24-base primer used was VVPE9905 (5′-GACGTTGATTGAGTTTCATTATCG-3′) located within the open reading frame of vvpE. The primer was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA products were purified and resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders generated with the same primers used for the primer extension. The nucleotide sequence of the plasmid DNA of pKC980 (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method with TopTM DNA polymerase (Bioneer, Seoul, Korea) following the manufacturer's protocols. The gels were then dried and exposed by the same procedure as used for Northern dot blots. The elastase activities of the ATCC29307 culture were analyzed at the indicated time intervals (Fig.1 A). Elastase activity appeared in the exponential phase of growth and reached a maximum in the stationary phase. The level of elastase activity increased about 10-fold in the stationary phase. This growth phase variation of elastase possibly occurs either at the transcriptional level or post-transcriptional level of vvpE expression. The relative levels of the vvpE mRNA in the same amount of total RNA isolated from ATCC29307 showed that the vvpEmRNA levels increased as the bacterial culture entered the stationary phase (Fig. 1 B). This result suggests that the increase in the level of elastase activity in the stationary phase was correlated with the increase in the mRNA level of thevvpE gene. This increase in the vvpE mRNA level could be the result of an increase in the rate of mRNA transcription initiation or increased mRNA stability. However, when the total RNAs were separated by electrophoresis and hybridized with the vvpE DNA probe, only one band corresponding to the full size of the vvpE mRNA deduced from the DNA sequence (about 2.0 kb) appeared (data not shown). These results indicated that the increased level of transcription initiation plays the major, if not sole, role for the increased elastase activity on the entry of theV. vulnificus cells into the stationary phase. The crp mutants KC74 and KC84 were constructed by allelic exchange and confirmed by PCR (Fig.2). The PCR analysis of the genomic DNA from ATCC 29307 or KP101 with primers CRP9901 and CRP9902 produced a 1.2-kb fragment (Fig. 2 B), whereas the genomic DNA from thecrp::nptI mutants resulted in an amplified DNA fragment approximately 2.4 kb in length. The 2.4-kb fragment is in agreement with the projected size of the DNA fragment containing wild-type crp (1.2 kb) and the nptI gene (1.2 kb). The mutants exhibited a slow growth and no fermentation of many sugars such as maltose and d-galactose, which is consistent with the phenotypes of a typical crp mutant. To determine the stability of the insertional mutation, KC74 or KC84 strains were grown overnight without kanamycin selection. The insertednptI DNA was stably maintained, as determined by the maintenance of kanamycin resistance and by the generation of the appropriately sized DNA fragment by PCR (data not shown). ATCC29307 and the crp mutant KC74 were grown to the stationary phase, and the elastase activities of each culture were compared. Although the general pattern of elastase production was similar in the two strains, in the KC74 strain the level of elastase was lower (Fig.3 A). Whereas elastase activity was present at about 30 units in the wild-type strain, the residual level of elastase activity in KC74 corresponded to approximately one-third of that in the wild type. The reduced production of elastase suggested that CRP acts as a positive regulator in vvpEexpression. To characterize the role of CRP in more detail, the effects of glucose and cAMP exogenously added to the wild type were studied. During the stationary phase, the elastase activity in the wild-type culture supplemented with 0.5% glucose alone was reduced to the level of the KC74 but was restored by the addition of glucose and cAMP (1 mm) together (data not shown). These results indicate that the expression of vvpE in V. vulnificus is under the positive control of cAMP·CRP at least in the stationary phase. When therpoS mutant KP101 was compared with its parental wild type during stationary growth, it produced much less elastase, and the level of elastase activity was almost 10-fold less than that of the wild type (Fig. 3 A). This result indicated that the major portion of elastase was produced by the RpoS-dependent promoter. Taking these results together led us to conclude that vvpEis under the positive control of both CRP and RpoS during stationary growth. However, it was apparent that vvpE was not completely repressed, even poorly expressed, in the absence of the active gene product of rpoS. This suggested the existence of at least one more promoter for vvpE, which is expressed in a RpoS-independent manner in the stationary phase. To examine whether the activation by CRP is through the RpoS-dependent promoter or RpoS-independent promoter, the level of elastase activity in the crp rpoS double mutant was determined. The elastase activity in the crp rpoS double mutant KC84 was present at 4 units (Fig. 3 A). This level of elastase activity was much lower than those reached by the wild type orcrp mutant KC74 but was indistinguishable from that in therpoS single mutant KP101 (Fig. 3 A). The expression of vvpE remained low unless the functional gene product of rpoS was provided and was not significantly affected by the additional inactivation of crp. This observation indicated that activation of vvpE by CRP in the stationary phase is mediated through the promoter whose activity depends on RpoS. For the complementation test, plasmid pKC0004 or pHS0001 was constructed by subcloning crp or rpoS, respectively, into pRK415. The elastase activities of both KC74 (pKC0004) and KP101 (pHS0001) in the stationary phase were restored to levels comparable with the wild-type level of ATCC29307 (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, the decreased elastase activity of KC74 and KP101 resulted from the inactivation of functional crp or rpoS rather than any polar effects on any genes downstream of crp orrpoS. The elastase activity in KC84 containing pHS0001 was restored to a level similar to that in KC74, whereas the repressed level of elastase in KC84 was not restored at all by the introduction of pKC0004 (Fig.3 B). This indicated that CRP was able to activatevvpE only when RpoS was present, supporting again our previous hypothesis that CRP exerts its effects on vvpEexpression through the RpoS-dependent promoter. In the log phase, the elastase activities of the wild type and its isogenic mutants were too low to be precisely compared. To ensure accurate sensitivity, avvpE-luxAB transcriptional fusion was employed to determine the elastase activity of the cultures in the log phase. For the ATCC29307 strain containing pHS0011, luminescence activity was present at about 90,000 relative light units (Fig.4 B). After cells were introduced with pHS0011, the expression of luminescence in thecrp or rpoS mutant and the crp rpoSdouble mutant cells did not differ significantly, and the levels of luminescence in the mutants were comparable with that in the wild type. Apparently, the promoter activity of vvpE in the log phase cells of V. vulnificus was not dependent on RpoS and not activated by CRP. However, the levels of luminescence decreased in the crp orrpoS mutant and the crp rpoS double mutant in the stationary phase when compared with that in the wild type. The magnitude of the decrease in luminescence in the mutants was similar to the decrease in elastase activities, which were determined directly (Fig. 4 C). The luminescence of the wild type is much higher in the stationary phase than in the log phase (Fig. 4, B andC). These results indicate that the upstream region ofvvpE used for construction of the vvpE-luxABfusion is sufficient for the stationary phase induction and the CRP and RpoS dependence of vvpE. These results also reconfirm the previous observation that vvpE expression is mainly regulated at the level of transcription. A single reverse transcript was identified from the RNA isolated from the log phase cells of both the wild type and all mutants tested (Fig.5). This indicated that a transcriptional start site, P1, located 61 base pairs upstream of the translational initiation codon, was used for the transcription of vvpE in the log phase. The putative promoter that constitutes P1 was named PL to represent the log phase promoter. Apparently, the PL activities, determined based on the intensity of the bands of the reverse transcripts, were unaffected by the inactivation of crp andrpoS. This observation is consistent with the results obtained from the vvpE expression studies with avvpE-lux fusion, as presented above. The primer extension analysis performed with RNA prepared from stationary cells revealed two different transcriptional start sites; one was identical to Pl, and the other, P2, was 3 base pairs apart from P1. The promoter S (PS), consisting of P2 and representing the stationary phase promoter, was not expressed in the log phase and was induced only when cells entered the stationary phase. In contrast to P1, the band corresponding to P2 was not detected with the RNA from therpoS mutant or crp rpoS double mutant and was reduced in its intensity with the RNA from the crp mutant. This observation indicates that the induction of PS is entirely dependent on RpoS, and CRP activates PS only in the presence of functional RpoS. However, the activity of PL, which was much lower than that of PS, appeared to be constitutive throughout the log and stationary growth phases. Consequently, the transcription of the vvpE of V. vulnificus was initiated by two different types of promoters, PL and PS, in a growth phase-dependent manner. The basal level of expression of vvpE was directed by PL, independent of RpoS and CRP, and remained low throughout the log and stationary growth phases. In addition to this basal level, more vvpEexpression was induced by PS in the stationary phase, which was under the control of both CRP and RpoS. This differential utilization of two promoters may permit precise levels of elastase in response to modifications of the environment and the growth stage. There have been several different lines of evidence leading to the hypothesis that elastase is an important, if not essential, component of virulence for V. vulnificus. Previously, the function of elastase during an infectious process, rather than the artificial system of injecting purified proteins, has been examined by constructing isogenic elastase mutants of V. vulnificus and applying the molecular version of Koch's postulates (4Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Shao C. Hor L. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When the isogenic vvpE mutants were compared with the parental strain for virulence in animal and cell culture models, the mutants did not show any significant differences in any aspect of the disease process. The major problem to be addressed is the discrepancy between these infection experiments and the studies that primarily relied on injection of proteins into animals. However, it is important to note that the expression of vvpE encoding elastase of V. vulnificus remains at a low level under certain conditions, such as in the log phase of growth. Although other explanations are possible, the lack of significant difference in virulence between the vvpE mutant and wild-type parent could be related to this low level of elastase expression in the conditions used. This possibility, which remains to be proved, strongly underscores that the expression pattern and level of putative virulence attributes during an infectious process must be examined to identify their roles in pathogenesis. In the present study, it was found that the expression ofvvpE encoding elastase of V. vulnificus is regulated as a function of the growth phase and reaches a maximum in the stationary phase. It has been previously reported that Enterobacteriaceae undergoes a global modification of their gene expression pattern at the onset of the stationary phase (16Hengge-Aronis R. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1497-1512Google Scholar, 17Kolter R. Siegele D.A. Tormo A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 855-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). As a result, the bacteria acquire tolerance to a number of chemical and physical stresses, such as extreme temperatures, oxidative agents, hyperosmotic tension, and nutritional starvation. The key regulator for the expression of the genes responsible for this increased tolerance is RpoS (ςS or ς38), a stationary phase-specific sigma factor (18Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recently, a direct role for RpoS in regulating the expression of numerous virulence factors has been established for a number of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae (20Chen C. Buchmeier N.C. Libby S. Fang F.C. Krause M. Guiney D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5303-5309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Iriarte M. Stainier I. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1840-1847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yildiz F.H. Schoolnik G.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From a standpoint of bacterial pathogenesis, the finding that numerous virulence factors are regulated by RpoS would be not surprising. When bacteria invade the human body, the scarcity of specific nutrients and increased stresses imposed by the host immune defense system would be encountered. As such, the bacteria must survive these stresses to multiply and finally result in local damage and systemic disease. This survival often involves coordinate expression of sets of assorted genes (23Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and many of these genes are probably regulated by RpoS. This report has shown that the expression of the V. vulnificus elastase gene is dependent on CRP. Besides regulating the synthesis of many catabolic enzymes, CRP regulation has also been observed in the synthesis of the toxin proteins of several pathogenic bacteria (24Nagai S. Yagihashi T. Ishihama A. Vet. Microbiol. 1998; 60: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25O'Byrne C.P. Dorman C.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 905-912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It was found that CRP affects the RpoS-dependent expression of vvpE at PS. There are several possible ways for CRP to affect PS. One is by binding directly to PS to stimulate open complex formation by the RpoS-RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Because purified V. vulnificus CRP is unavailable, in vivo footprinting was performed to identify the CRP binding region in the vvpE upstream region (27Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 146-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Dimethylsufate methylation-protection footprinting revealed no difference in the protection pattern in the upstream region ofvvpE between KC74 and its parental wild type (data not shown). In agreement with this, no convincing consensus sequences for CRP binding are identified in the upstream region of vvpE(Fig. 6.). These observations suggest the possibility that CRP activates PS indirectly by increasing the cellular level of either RpoS or an unidentified third component(s) in the stationary phase. The unidentified component(s) may then modulate the level of RpoS or bind directly upstream of the vvpE to activate the PS. In E. coli, the cellular levels of RpoS increase at the onset of the stationary phase, but the regulation mechanisms that modulate the level of the RpoS protein appear to be complicated and are not clearly understood (for a recent review, see Ref. 28Loewen P.C. Hu B. Strutinsky J. Sparling R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 707-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular content of RpoS is regulated at the level of rpoStranscription, translation, and RpoS proteolysis in E. coli. Although some contradictions have also been observed, it has been proposed that the transcriptional control of rpoS involves the CRP·cAMP complex as a negative regulator in E. coli. However, it has not yet been established whether CRP is involved in the modulation of the cellular level of RpoS in V. vulnificus. Experiments to further examine the effects of CRP on the level of the expression of rpoS and on the level of RpoS in V. vulnificus are now underway. Because the expression of vvpE from PL is constitutive through the log and stationary phases, PL would be transcribed most likely by the RNA polymerase holoenzyme with the homolog of RpoD (ς70) that is the major housekeeping sigma factor inE. coli. However, the exact type of sigma factor associated with the RNA polymerase for the transcription of PL has not yet been determined. Several hundred base pairs upstream of vvpE were sequenced and analyzed by comparing them with putative promoter sequences suggested previously on the basis of homology to a consensus from E. coli (Fig. 6). A Shine-Dalgarno site (AGGA) and potential promoter sequences consisting of −10 and −35 segments separated by 17 nucleotides have been assigned. The assigned sequences for −35 (TTCTGA or TGAACC) scored a 50% homology to the −35 consensus sequences (TTGACA) of the promoters recognized by the RNA polymerase with RpoD. However, no sequence of the −10 regions assigned with respect to either P1 or P2 revealed a reasonable homology to −10 consensus sequences. It has been reported that the sequences for promoters transcribed by RNA polymerase with RpoS are notoriously weakly conserved. It is also noteworthy that the expression level ofvvpE from PL is very low, and the weak homology of the promoter sequences to the consensus sequences may explain this low level of expression of vvpE from PL. However, additional work is needed to clarify whether these regions really act as RNA polymerase recognition sites."

When Wnt acts on its cell-surface receptor Frizzled, Dvl, a cytoplasmic protein, antagonizes the action of GSK-3β. Indeed, Dvl inhibits GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, APC, and Axin in vitro and the phosphorylation of Axin in intact cells (21Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Kishida M. Ikeda S. Takada S.

Although this mechanism has not yet been clarified, it has been suggested that Frat, which is a GSK-3-binding protein (24Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), forms a complex with Dvl and that this complex induces the dissociation of GSK-3β from Axin (25Li L.

We have recently identified the novel proteins Axam and Idax, which suppress the Wnt signaling (23Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Axam binds to Axin and inhibits the binding of Dvl to Axin. It stimulates the down-regulation of β-catenin in mammalian cells and inhibits the axis formation, which is regulated by Wnt in Xenopus embryos (23Kadoya T. Kishida S. Fukui A. Hinoi T. Michiue T. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37030-37037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Idax interacts with the PDZ domain of Dvl and inhibits the complex formation of Dvl and Axin. It inhibits Wnt-dependent accumulation of β-catenin in mammalian cells and Wnt-dependent axis duplication inXenopus embryos (26Hino S.-I. Kishida S. Michiue T. Fukui A. Sakamoto I. Takada S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 330-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, Wnt signal may relieve the activities of Axam and Idax to inhibit the binding of Dvl to Axin. Once the phosphorylation of β-catenin is reduced, it dissociates from the Axin complex, and β-catenin is no longer degraded, resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Accumulated β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus where it binds to Tcf/lymphocyte enhancer binding factor, a transcription factor (27Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kühl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2134) Google Scholar). The catalytic C subunit of PP2A is associated with the constant regulatory A subunit, and other regulatory subunits (B/PR55, B′/B56/PR61, or B“/PR72/PR59) associate with this dimeric core and modulate the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity (38Usui H.

PP2A that consists of the C and A subunits (PP2A(CA)) interacts with Axin and dephosphorylates Axin and APC (16Ikeda S. Kishida M. Matsuura Y. Usui H. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the B56 subunit of PP2A interacts with APC and that its expression reduces the level of β-catenin and inhibits the transcription of β-catenin target gene (43Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, the mode of action of B56/PR61 in the Wnt signaling pathway is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that PR61 binds to Axin in intact cells and in vitro. We also show that PR61 does not affect the stability of β-catenin but that it inhibits Dvl- and β-catenin-induced Tcf activation in mammalian cells. Further, we demonstrate that PR61 induces ventralization and suppresses β-catenin-dependent axis duplication in Xenopus embryos, suggesting that PR61 functions either at the level of β-catenin or further downstream. Taken together with the previous observations that PR61 acts upstream of β-catenin (43Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R. Moon R.T. White R. Virshup D.M. Science. 1999; 283: 2089-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), these results suggest that PR61 negatively regulates the Wnt signaling pathway at various steps. Because PR61 and B56 denote the same molecule (41Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), we use the name of “PR61” in this study. pCMV-Flag/PP2A(C), pcDNA3/Flag-rAxin, pcDNAI/hTcf-4E and pTOPFLASH, and pUC/EF-1α/β-cateninSA were supplied by Drs. K. Yonezawa (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan), K. Miyazono (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan), H. Clevers (University Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands), and A. Nagafuchi (Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan), respectively. β-CateninSA is a β-catenin mutant in which serine and threonine residues of the GSK-3β phosphorylation sites are changed to alanine (6Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). The anti-MBP and anti-GST antibodies were kindly supplied by Dr. M. Nakata (Sumitomo Electronics, Yokohama, Japan). Wnt-3a conditioned medium was prepared as described (44Shibamoto S. Higano K. Takada R. Ito F. Takeichi M. Takada S. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To generate the anti-phosphorylated Axin antibody, three phosphorylated peptides of rAxin, PA322 (Cys-Leu-Ala-Pro-Ala-Thr-Ser(P)322-Ala-Asn-Asp-Ser-Glu), PA326 (Cys-Thr-Ser-Ala-Asn-Asp-Ser(P)326-Glu-Gln-Gln-Ser-Leu), and PA330 (Cys-Asp-Ser-Glu-Gln-Gln-Ser(P)330-Leu-Ser-Ser-Asp-Ala), were synthesized, and polyclonal antibodies against PA322 (P322 antibody), PA326 (P326 antibody), and PA330 (P330 antibody) were produced in rabbits by immunization with these peptides by Dr. T. Hachiya (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). PP2A consisting of the catalytic and regulatory A subunits was purified from human erythrocytes (38Usui H. Imazu M. Maeta K. Tsukamoto H. Azuma K. Takeda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3752-3761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MBP- and GST-fused proteins were purified from Escherichia coli according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-Myc antibody was prepared from 9E10 cells. COS, 293 or L, and PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10% fetal calf serum and 5% horse serum, respectively. L cells stably expressing HA-PR61β (L/PR61β cells) were generated by selecting with G418 as described (20Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S.

Other materials were from commercial sources. Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used to construct the following plasmids, pBTM116HA/Axil, pEF-BOS-HA/PR61β, pGEX-KG/PR61β, pSP64T-Myc/PR61β, pEF-BOS-HA/PR61γ, pBJ-1/PR61δ-3HA, pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxinΔDIX, pMAL-c2/rAxin-(229–506), and pMAL-c2/rAxin-(298–506)S322A. In these plasmids, some plasmid constructions were done by digesting the original plasmids with restriction enzymes and inserting the fragments into the vectors. The other constructions were done by inserting the fragments generated by Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) into the vectors. The entire PCR products were sequenced, and the structures of all of the plasmids were confirmed by restriction analyses. pBJ-Myc/rAxin, pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin, pEF-BOS-Myc/rAxin-(1–529), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(1–229), pEF-BOS/Myc-rAxin-(298–506), pBJ-Myc/rAxin-(713–832), pMAL-c2/rAxin, pMAL-c2/rAxin-(1–529), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(1–229), pMAL-c2/rAxin-(508–832), pBJ-Myc/rAxinSA, pBJ-Myc/rAxinΔGSK-3β, pCGN/Dvl-1, pEF-BOS-HA/hTcf-4E, and pSP64T/Xglobin were constructed as described (7Ikeda S.

To determine whether PR61 interacts with Axin in intact cells, COS cells (60-mm-diameter dish) transfected with pEF-BOS- and pBJ-derived plasmids were lysed as described (46Kikuchi A. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 588-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lysates (200 µg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, and then the precipitates were probed with the anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies. To examine the direct interaction of PR61 with Axin using the purified proteins in vitro, MBP-rAxin and its deletion mutants (0.5 µm) were incubated with 10 pmol of GST-PR61β immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 50 µl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5% CHAPS) for 1 h at 4 °C. After GST-PR61β was precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-MBP antibody. To examine whether the trimer of PP2A associates with Axin, GST-PR61β complexed with PP2A(CA) was prepared. After 2.4 µmGST-PR61β had been incubated with 3 µm purified PP2A(CA) in 1 ml of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C, GST-PR61β was precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B and washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) to remove free PP2A(CA). About 0.25 mol of PP2A(CA) was complexed with 1 mol of GST-PR61β. 1.2 µmGST-PR61β, 0.3 µm PP2A(CA), and 1.2 µmGST-PR61β complexed with PP2A(CA) were incubated with 7.5 pmol of either MBP-rAxin or MBP immobilized on amylose resin in 25 µl of reaction mixture for 1 h at 4 °C. After MBP-rAxin and MBP were precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-GST and anti-PP2A(C) antibodies. In another experiment, the lysates (100 µg of protein) of COS cells transfected with or without pEF-BOS-HA/PR61β were incubated with 30 pmol of MBP-rAxin or MBP immobilized on amylose resin in 100 µl of reaction mixture (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mmNaCl, and 10% glycerol) for 1 h at 4 °C. After MBP-rAxin and MBP were precipitated by centrifugation, the precipitates were probed with the anti-HA and anti-PP2A(C) antibodies. To observe the phosphorylation state of Axin in intact cells, the lysates of COS, L, and 293 cells expressing wild-type Myc-rAxin, Myc-rAxinSA, or Myc-rAxinΔGSK-3β with or without HA-PR61β or Flag-PP2A(C) were probed with the anti-P322, anti-P326, or anti-P330 antibody. When necessary, Myc-rAxin was immunoprecipitated from L cells stably expressing Myc-rAxin with the anti-Myc antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were incubated with 6 units of alkaline phosphatase in 20 µl of phosphatase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were probed with the anti-Myc or anti-P322 antibody. To show that the anti-P322 antibody detects the direct phosphorylation of Axin by GSK-3β, 0.2 µm MBP-rAxin, MBP-rAxin-(298–506), or MBP-rAxin-(298–506)S322A was incubated with 50 nm GST-GSK-3β in 30 µl of kinase reaction mixture (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 µm ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were probed with the anti-P322 antibody. To observe the effect of PR61β on the stabilization of β-catenin, wild-type L cells or L/PR61β cells (35-mm-diameter dish) were deprived of serum for 6 h, then treated with Wnt-3a conditioned medium for 12 h. The lysates were probed with the anti-β-catenin antibody. To examine whether PR61β affects the Wnt-3a-dependent Tcf-4 activation, wild-type L cells or L/PR61β cells (35-mm-diameter dish) were transfected with 0.5 µg of pTOPFLASH, 0.1 µg of pEF-BOS-HA/hTcf-4E, and 0.5 µg of pME18S/lacZ. After the cells were deprived of serum for 6 h and then treated with Wnt-3a conditioned medium for 12 h, they were lysed and the luciferase activity was measured (20Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To observe the effect of PR61β on Dvl- and β-catenin-dependent Tcf-4 activation, 0.2 µg of pCGN/Dvl-1 or 30 ng of pUC/EF-1α/β-cateninSA and the indicated amounts of pCMV-Flag/PP2A(C) or pEF-BOS-HA/PR61β were transfected into 293 or PC12 cells (35-mm-diameter dish) with 0.5 µg of pTOPFLASH, 0.1 µg of pEF-BOS-HA/hTcf-4E, and 0.5 µg of pME18S/lacZ. After 46 h, the cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured as described (20Kishida M. Koyama S. Kishida S. Matsubara K. Nakashima S. Higano K. Takada R. Takada S. Kikuchi A.

To standardize the transfection efficiency, pME18S/lacZ carrying SRα-promoter linked to the coding sequence of β-galactosidase gene was used as an internal control. PR61β cDNA was subcloned into theBglII site of pSP64T. Sense mRNA was obtained byin vitro transcription of linearized templates using SP6-mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Fertilized eggs were dejellied using 4.5% cysteine acid, and the indicated mRNAs were injected into dorsal or ventral blastomeres at the four-cell stage. After injection, embryos were cultured for 3 days (at stage 40–41). UV light irradiation was performed as described (48Scharf S.R. Gerhart J.C. Dev. Biol. 1980; 79: 181-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the injected embryos were evaluated by DAI (49Kao K.R. Elinson R.P. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 64-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To carry out RT-PCR, total RNAs of embryos at stage 10.5 were isolated. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNAs were synthesized using 5 µg of total RNA from 10 embryos. PCR analyses (35 cycles) were performed with ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara). Primers for PCR are: EF-1α, 5′-CAG ATT GGT GCT GGA TAT GC-3′ and 5′-ACT GCC TTG ATG ACT CCT AG-3′;siamois, 5′-AAG ATA ACT GGC ATT CCT GAG C-3′ and 5′-GGT AGG GCT GTG TAT TTG AAG G-3′. Yeast two-hybrid screening was carried out as described (7Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). To identify proteins that physically interact with Axil (10Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Uochi T. Ikeda S. Koyama S. Asashima M. Kikuchi A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), an Axin homolog, we conducted a mouse brain cDNA library screening by the yeast two-hybrid method. From 1.7 × 105 initial transformants, two clones, PR61β and PR61γ, were found to confer both the His+ and LacZ+ phenotypes on L40 expressing Axil. Both proteins are known to be regulatory subunits of PP2A and to regulate its phosphatase activity and subcellular localization (41Millward T.A. Zolnierowicz S. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 42Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). In the two-hybrid assay, Axin also interacted with PR61β and PR61γ (data not shown), suggesting that PR61 might regulate the functions of both Axin and Axil. Because Axin has been well characterized (8Kikuchi A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Kikuchi A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1999; 10: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we used Axin to examine this possibility. Various deletion mutants of rAxin in this study are shown in Fig. 1. First we examined whether PR61 forms a complex with Axin in intact cells. Myc-rAxin was co-expressed with HA-PR61β or HA-PR61γ in COS cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–5). When the lysates co-expressing Myc-rAxin with HA-PR61β were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, HA-PR61β was detected in the Myc-rAxin immune complex (Fig. 2 A,lane 8). Similarly, when the lysates co-expressing Myc-rAxin with HA-PR61γ were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, HA-PR61γ was detected in the Myc-rAxin immune complex (Fig.2 A, lane 9). When the lysates expressing either HA-PR61β or HA-PR61γ alone were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, neither HA-PR61β nor HA-PR61γ was detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6 and7). Further, HA-PR61δ also formed a complex with Myc-rAxin in L cells (data not shown). To determine which region of rAxin forms a complex with PR61β in intact cells, various deletion mutants of Myc-rAxin were co-expressed with HA-PR61β in COS cells (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–7). When the lysates expressing Myc-rAxin mutants were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Myc antibody, HA-PR61β was coprecipitated with Myc-rAxin (full-length), Myc-rAxinΔDIX, and Myc-rAxin-(1–529) but not with Myc-rAxin-(1–229), Myc-rAxin-(298–506), or Myc-rAxin-(713–832) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–13). These results indicate that Axin forms a complex with PR61 in intact cells and that the N-terminal region of Axin (1–529 amino acids) containing the RGS (regulators of the G protein signaling) domain and the GSK-3β- and β-catenin-binding sites is necessary for the interaction with PR61, but none of these individual sites is sufficient. To examine whether the interaction of Axin with PR61 is direct, MBP-rAxin, its deletion mutants, and GST-PR61β w"
https://openalex.org/W1993101111,"Abstract Mouse temperature-sensitive p53Val-135 accumulates in the nucleus and acts as a “wild-type” at 32 °C while it is sequestered in the cytoplasm at 37 °C. The cytoplasmic p53Val-135 relocalized into the nucleus upon inhibition of the nuclear export at 37 °C, whereas a mutation in a major bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) caused constitutive cytoplasmic localization, indicating that it shuttled between the cytoplasm and the nucleus by its own nuclear export signal and NLS rather than tethered to cytoplasmic structures. Although the full-length p53Val-135 did not bind the import receptor at 37 °C, a C-terminally truncated p53Val-135 lacking residues 326–390 did bind it. Molecular chaperones such as Hsc70 were associated with p53Val-135 at 37 °C but not at 32 °C. When the nuclear export was blocked by leptomycin B, only a fraction lacking Hsc70 was specifically accumulated in the nucleus. Immunodepletion of Hsc70 from the reticulocyte lysate caused p53Val-135 to bind the import receptor. This binding was blocked by supplying the cell extract containing Hsc70 but not by the addition of recombinant Hsc70 alone. We suggest that the association with the Hsc70-containing complex prevents the NLS from the access of the import receptor through the C-terminal region of p53Val-135 at 37 °C, whereas its dissociation at 32 °C allows rapid nuclear import."
https://openalex.org/W2000493305,"Regulation of p53 involves a complex network of protein interactions. The primary regulator of p53 protein stability is the Mdm2 protein. ARF and MdmX are two proteins that have recently been shown to inhibit Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53 via distinct associations with Mdm2. We demonstrate here that ARF is capable of interacting with MdmX and in a manner similar to its association with Mdm2, sequestering MdmX within the nucleolus. The sequestration of MdmX by ARF results in an increase in p53 transactivation. In addition, the redistribution of MdmX by ARF requires that a nucleolar localization signal be present on MdmX. Although expression of either MdmX or ARF leads to Mdm2 stabilization, coexpression of both MdmX and ARF results in a decrease in Mdm2 protein levels. Similarly, increasing ARF protein levels in the presence of constant MdmX and Mdm2 leads to a dose-dependent decrease in Mdm2 levels. Under these conditions, ARF can synergistically reverse the ability of Mdm2 and MdmX to inhibit p53-dependent transactivation. Finally, the association and redistribution of MdmX by ARF has no effect on the protein stability of either ARF or MdmX. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the interaction between MdmX and ARF represents a novel pathway for regulating Mdm2 protein levels. Additionally, both MdmX and Mdm2, either individually or together, are capable of antagonizing the effects of the ARF tumor suppressor on p53 activity.

Additional overlap between p53 and Rb is provided by theINK4A locus, which encodes both p16INK4a and p19ARF proteins (9Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Although the coding transcripts of these proteins share common exons, the primary amino acid sequences of both proteins are unique. Overexpression of p16INK4A or p19ARF results in a cell cycle arrest through distinct pathways involving either Rb or p53, respectively (9Quelle D.E. Zindy F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) or act as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate p53 (17Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with Mdm2, ARF must also contain two functional nucleolar localization signals (NrLS) (18Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol.

However, recent evidence indicates that an additional NrLS within the C-terminal RING finger of Mdm2 is also required for nucleolar localization of the ARF·Mdm2 complex. Deletion of the NrLS or a more subtle mutation of the basic residues of the NrLS to uncharged amino acids results in failure of the two proteins to colocalize in the nucleolus (19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L.

Recently, we demonstrated that the MdmX protein, a p53-binding protein with homology to Mdm2, could protect p53 from Mdm2-mediated degradation while maintaining suppression of p53-dependent transactivation (22Jackson M. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, additional studies have demonstrated that Mdm2 is also stabilized through association with MdmX (23Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N.A. Grivell S. Attema J. van De Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28039-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 24Sharp D.A. Kratowicz S.A. Sank M.J. George D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Given the homology between MdmX and Mdm2, we examined the localization of MdmX in the presence or absence of ARF. Our data indicate that coexpression of ARF with MdmX results in the mobilization of full-length MdmX to the nucleoli, where it is not found in the absence of ARF. Redistribution of MdmX by ARF reverses the MdmX-mediated inhibition of p53 transactivation. Interestingly, MdmX and ARF have an antagonistic effect on each other with respect to their ability to stabilize Mdm2, whereas MdmX and Mdm2 work synergistically to reverse ARF induction of p53 transactivation. U2OS cells are an osteosarcoma cell line containing wild-type p53 and having no detectable ARF protein (10Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). H1299 cells are a non-small cell lung carcinoma devoid of p53. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies include monoclonal FLAG M2 (Sigma), monoclonal V5 (Invitrogen), monoclonal GFP (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and polyclonal ARF Ab-1 (Neomarkers). For immunofluorescence analysis, a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used. An horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Promega) was used for chemiluminescent detection of proteins. The p14ARF-GFP expression plasmid has been described previously (25Lindstrom M.S. Klangby U. Inoue R. Pisa P. Wiman K.G. Asker C.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The p19ARF-Myc/His plasmid contains the murine ARF cDNA with a C-terminal Myc/His epitope tag. Mdm2-FLAG is in the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma), which encodes a FLAG epitope tag onto the amino terminus of the Mdm2 protein. Human MdmX and MdmX-(1–446) are in the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector, which encodes a V5 epitope tag and a six-histidine tag onto the C terminus of the expressed protein. The human MdmX cDNA used as a template for amplification was kindly provided by Dr. Aart Jochemsen. The PG13-luc plasmid was constructed by cloning 13 copies of a synthetic p53 DNA binding site upstream of a SV40 promoter-luciferase gene. MG15-luc contains 15 copies of a mutated p53 DNA binding site cloned upstream of the SV40 promoter-luciferase reporter gene. The pQE-β-gal plasmid was used to normalize transfection efficiency. In the p53 transactivation studies, ARF, mdm2, and mdmX expression plasmids were used. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). In Fig. 3, a pHOOK plasmid (Invitrogen) was included with each transfection to allow immunoselection of transfected cells with Capture-Tec beads (Invitrogen). For Western analysis in Figs. 4 and 5, transfection efficiencies were normalized by the inclusion of a pGL3-luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) in each transfection.Figure 4Interaction between MdmX and ARF destabilizes Mdm2 and inhibits p53 transactivation.A, Western blot analysis of cellular extracts from transfected U2OS cells was used to determine Mdm2, ARF, and MdmX protein levels. Coexpression of MdmX with Mdm2 resulted in the stabilization of Mdm2. However, expression of increasing amounts of ARF in the presence of MdmX resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the stabilization of Mdm2 protein by MdmX. B, extracts from transfected U2OS cells were used in Western blot analysis to monitor MdmX-(1–466) and ARF proteins levels. The stabilization of Mdm2 observed following the coexpression of ARF is not affected by an NrLS-deficient MdmX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Expression of ARF and MdmX does not alter protein stability. U2OS cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding: A, V5-tagged human MdmX and increasing amounts of ARF·GFP; or B, ARF·GFP and increasing amounts of V5-tagged human MdmX. After 24 h, cell extracts were made and Western analysis was performed to determine ARF and MdmX protein levels. The protein stability levels of MdmX and ARF are not altered by one another.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunofluorescence analysis was performed 24 h after transfection. Transfected U2OS cells on chamber slides (LabTech) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked for 2 h with 10% goat serum, 0.01% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibody was added to a 1/10 dilution of blocking solution and incubated for 1 h. The cells were washed five times and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h. Nuclei were stained with 25 μg/ml Hoechst Dye (Sigma) for 2 min. B23 immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (25Lindstrom M.S. Klangby U. Inoue R. Pisa P. Wiman K.G. Asker C.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments, whole cell extracts were made 24 h following transfection by incubating cell pellets for 30 min in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation analysis was performed by adding 100 μg of pHOOK cell extracts with 1 μg of monoclonal V5 antibody in a total volume of 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100. Following overnight incubation, 25 μl of protein G-agarose was added and incubated an additional 1 h before washing three times for 30 min each time. Pellets were resuspended in 25 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer and resolved using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer of proteins to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) using a Transblot system (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Berberich S.J. Litteral V. Mayo L.D. Tabesh D. Morris D. Differentiation. 1999; 64: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using primary antibody dilutions of 1:1,000–1:2,500 and secondary dilutions of 1:5,000–1:10,000. For p53 reporter assays, extracts were made 24 h after transfection. p53 transactivation was determined by quantifying luciferase activity in aliquots from whole cell extracts using a luciferase assay system (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was determined by incubating protein extracts in 100 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 650 μ g/mlO-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 0.5–2 h. β-Galactosidase activity was calculated by converting the absorbance read at 420 nm into milliunits of β-galactosidase activity per microliter of extract. All luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed in duplicate. Error bars of relative p53 transactivation represent the average deviation for the relative luciferase units divided by the milliunits of β-galactosidase. Previous studies have demonstrated that ARF is localized to the nucleolus (10Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The Mdm2 protein, although not found in nucleoli in the absence of ARF, can be mobilized to nucleoli following either coexpression of ARF or induced ARF expression (14Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Based on the homology between Mdm2 and MdmX, we first examined whether MdmX was found in nucleoli or could be colocalized with ARF. U2OS cells, which do not express ARF yet do possess wild-type p53 protein (10Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid encoding a V5-epitope tagged human MdmX protein in the presence or absence of an expression plasmid encoding an ARF·GFP fusion protein. In the absence of ARF (or in the presence of GFP, data not shown), MdmX showed no nucleolar localization (Fig.1A, panel l). However, upon coexpression of ARF, MdmX became localized to the nucleolus (Fig.1A, panels j and k). When MdmX and ARF signals were overlaid they demonstrated clear colocalization (Fig.1A, panels m and n). ARF localization to the nucleolus (Fig. 1A, panel e) was confirmed in transfected U2OS cells by demonstrating that ARF colocalized with the nucleolus protein B23 (Fig. 1A, panels p and q). To determine the effect of ARF expression on MdmX regulation of p53 transactivation, U2OS cells were transfected with the p53-responsive promoter PG13-luc. As expected, transfection of the p53-responsive promoter (PG13-luc) into cells possessing wild-type p53 protein led to a 6-fold increase in p53 transactivation when compared with transfection of a p53 reporter plasmid containing mutant p53 DNA binding sites (MG15-luc; Fig.1B). Coexpression of a mdmX expression vector led to a modest 20% decrease in the activity of the p53 responsive promoter (Fig. 1B). With increasing levels of mdmX expression vector, p53 transactivation levels do continue to decrease in U2OS cells (data not shown). Interestingly, the addition of a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio ofmdmX:ARF expression vectors led to a dose-dependent increase in p53 transactivation, surpassing levels of p53 transactivation seen in the absence of exogenous MdmX or ARF. The 2.7-fold increase in p53 transactivation reporter activity seen on comparing the 1:2 mdmX:ARF transfections with the PG13-luc only transfected U2OS cells most likely means that the elevated ARF protein levels effectively sequestered both the exogenous MdmX and endogenous Mdm2, thereby stabilizing and maximizing the nuclear pools of free p53 protein (Fig.1B). Based on the requirement for a conserved stretch of basic amino acids, or NrLS, in the RING domain of Mdm2 (19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we examined whether MdmX contains a similar NrLS. Fig.2A compares the NrLS of Mdm2 with the putative NrLS of both human and murine MdmX. Both human and murine MdmX sequences have a conserved (R/K)(R/K)X(R/K) motif previously shown to be required for the nucleolar localization of the ARF·Mdm2 complex (19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar,21Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To examine the importance of the putative NrLS in MdmX, a deletion mutant of MdmX lacking the RING finger domain, which contains the NrLS, was constructed, and its ability to colocalize with ARF was tested. The deletion matched a similar deletion made in Mdm2, which demonstrated the requirement for a NrLS in the Mdm2 RING finger for proper Mdm2·ARF nucleoli localization (19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). As seen with Mdm2, MdmX-(1–446), which lacked the MdmX RING domain, was unable to colocalize to the nucleolus with ARF (Fig. 2B, panel h). Surprisingly, ARF was not completely prohibited from entering the nucleolus when coexpressed with MdmX-(1–446) (Fig. 2B, panel e), contrasting the results reported with NrLS-deficient Mdm2 proteins (19Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. DiGiammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Lohrum M.A. Ashcroft M. Kubbutat M.H. Vousden K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In any event, expression of MdmX-(1–446) did lead to a greater accumulation of ARF in the nucleoplasm when compared with coexpression with full-length MdmX (Fig. 2B, comparepanels d and e). The inability of MdmX-(1–446) to maintain ARF within the nucleoplasm may simply represent differences in ARF binding to MdmX and MdmX-(1–446). To test this possibility, H1299 cells were transfected as described in Fig. 2B, MdmX protein was immunoprecipitated, and the interaction with ARF was confirmed by Western analysis. Based on immunoprecipitation results (Fig.3A), both full-length MdmX and MdmX-(1–446) were capable of interacting with ARF. Comparing the immunoprecipiations to a parallel immunoblot (Fig. 3A, lower panel), there appears to be a slight but reproducible decrease in the amount of ARF bound to MdmX-(1–446) relative to full-length MdmX. Perhaps the interaction between ARF and MdmX is not as stable in the nucleoplasm as it is in the nucleolus. The nucleolar localization of ARF in transfected H1299 cells (Fig. 3B) confirmed that ARF localization was comparable with that seen in U2OS cells. We also examined a more truncated version of MdmX, amino acids 1–363, which also binds to ARF but is unable to colocalize to the nucleolus with ARF (data not shown). Taken together, the data in Figs. 2 and 3 are consistent with the similar interpretation made for Mdm2, namely that MdmX must contain a functional RING finger domain in order for ARF to mobilize it to the nucleolus but not for association with ARF. Because ARF and MdmX have both been reported to individually stabilize the Mdm2 protein (10Stott F.J. Bates S. James M.C. McConnell B.B. Starborg M. Brookes S. Palmero I. Ryan K. Hara E. Vousden K.H. Peters G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5001-5014Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 23Stad R. Ramos Y.F. Little N.A. Grivell S. Attema J. van De Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38189-38196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), we next examined how MdmX affects the stability of Mdm2 either alone or in the presence of increasing levels of ARF protein. Although studies examining mdmX gene expression have failed to uncover any significant modulation (27Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5349-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), one group has reported substantially higher levels of mdmX mRNA in the thymus of both human and mouse (29Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) suggesting that elevated MdmX protein may occur in specific tissues. In agreement with previously reported data, MdmX was able to stabilize the Mdm2 protein (Fig.4A, lane 3). In contrast, coexpression of MdmX and ARF together had a dose-dependent antagonistic effect on the ability of both proteins to stabilize Mdm2 protein (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–6). Interestingly, there was also a slight, but reproducible, decrease in MdmX protein levels as ARF protein levels increased and Mdm2 protein levels decreased (Fig. 4A, lanes 3–6). It is possible that the decrease in MdmX protein levels results from a decrease in MdmX·Mdm2 complex formation. This would be in agreement with one recent study in which MdmX mutants lacking the RING finger domain showed decreased protein stability relative to full-length MdmX (30Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). As expected, overexpression of MdmX-(1–446) protein was not able to stabilize Mdm2 protein when expressed in U2OS cells (Fig.4B, lane 5), nor was it able to antagonize the ability of ARF protein to stabilize Mdm2 protein (Fig. 4B,lane 4). The inability of MdmX-(1–446) to reverse the ARF-induced stability of Mdm2 implies that the association of MdmX and ARF may not be sufficient to reverse the ARF stability of Mdm2 and that nucleolar localization of ARF and MdmX is required to destabilize Mdm2. The results shown in Fig. 4A demonstrated that the stability of both MdmX and Mdm2 decreased as ARF protein levels increased. To determine whether the decrease in MdmX stability was dependent upon Mdm2 or ARF, MdmX was expressed in U2OS cells with increasing ARF in the absence of Mdm2. Under these transfection conditions, increasing ARF protein levels did not affect MdmX protein levels (Fig.5A), consistent with the stability of MdmX in Fig. 4A being more dependent on the presence of elevated Mdm2 than ARF levels. Finally, there was no alteration in ARF levels as in transfections containing increasing levels of MdmX expression vector (Fig. 5B). Taken together, the results shown in Fig. 5 suggest that the association between MdmX and ARF has no dramatic effect on the stability of either protein. Finally, to examine the effects of coexpressing Mdm2, MdmX, and ARF on endogenous p53 transactivation, U2OS cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids and the p53-responsive promoter, PG13-luc (Fig. 6). As expected, transfection of Mdm2 and MdmX expression vectors together, led to a >90% decrease in p53 transactivation (Fig. 6A). The inhibition of p53 transactivation by transfection with mdm2 and mdmX expression vectors was reversed, in a dose-dependent manner, by coexpression with ARF expression vectors (Fig.6A). The increase in p53 transactivation seen in transfections of increasing ARF in the presence of constant Mdm2 and MdmX most likely results from with ARF nucleolar sequestration of Mdm2 (14Pomerantz J. Schreiber-Agus N. Liegeois N.J. Silverman A. Alland L. Chin L. Potes J. Chen K. Orlow I. Lee H.W. Cordon-Cardo C. DePinho R.A.

Finally, consistent with the antagonist effects of ARF and MdmX functioning through nucleolar sequestration, a 5-fold increase in p53 transactivation detected when ARF was overexpressed in U2OS cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with transfection of increasing levels of mdmX expression plasmid (Fig.6B). Taken together with the results in Fig. 1B, these data demonstrate that MdmX regulation of p53 transactivation is not limited to its direct association with p53 (29Shvarts A. Bazuine M. Dekker P. Ramos Y.F. Steegenga W.T. Merckx G. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Both ARF and MdmX are capable of regulating p53 protein levels through binding to and inhibiting Mdm2 function. However, MdmX also binds directly to p53, resulting in the nucleoplasmic sequestration of p53 protein and inhibition of p53 transactivation (22Jackson M. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this report that in addition to mobilizing Mdm2 to the nucleolus, ARF can also interact with and direct the nucleolar localization of MdmX (Fig. 1A). Redistribution of MdmX requires the C-terminal RING domain of MdmX that contains a conserved stretch of basic amino acids recently identified as an NrLS in Mdm2 (Fig. 2). Mobilization of MdmX from the nucleoplasm to the nucleoli segregates MdmX from p53, resulting in a decrease in the ability of MdmX to interact with and inhibit p53 transactivation (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we show that coexpression of MdmX with ARF and Mdm2 results in a decrease in Mdm2 stability, indicating that interaction of MdmX and ARF prohibits the stabilizing interaction between Mdm2 and ARF and likely blocks MdmX interactions with Mdm2. Interestingly, although the coexpression of MdmX, Mdm2, and ARF results in decreased Mdm2 protein levels relative to MdmX and Mdm2 alone, it also resulted in a lower level of p53 transactivation relative to ARF alone (Fig.6A). These data are consistent with a model in which the nucleolar sequestration of MdmX through MdmX·ARF complexes releases Mdm2, leading to its eventual for degradation (Fig.7). Because the ability of MdmX to stabilize Mdm2 (Fig. 7A) is lost upon coexpression of ARF, we predict that the existence of an equilibrium between MdmX·Mdm2, Mdm2·ARF, and MdmX·ARF complexes may ultimately balance the levels of both Mdm2 and p53 (Fig. 7,B and C). Clearly a key factor in this effect is the ratio of MdmX and Mdm2 protein. It is worth noting that the MdmX protein has a much greater half-life than Mdm2; therefore, it is likely that in these present studies when cotransfecting equal molar amounts of mdm2 and mdmX plasmids, the MdmX protein concentration is significantly higher than that for Mdm2 protein. Studies comparing the various binding affinities between the Mdm2, MdmX, and ARF heterodimeric complexes are currently ongoing. At the cellular level we speculate that in tissues such as the thymus, brain, and testis, where higher levels of mdmX transcripts have been reported relative to other tissues (28Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P. Bazuine M. van Ham R.C. van der Houven van Oordt W. Hateboer G. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

Jochemsen A.G. Genomics. 1997; 43: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), that ARF-MdmX interactions (Fig. 7C) may play a role consistent with those observed in these overexpression studies. Taken together, the observations detailed here support a model whereby MdmX is responsible for maintaining the nucleoplasmic localization of Mdm2 and p53 in actively dividing cells. During a DNA-damaging event in which p53 and Mdm2 would become induced, MdmX would likely be of little consequence because reports from our laboratory and others have shown that MdmX proteins are not induced following DNA damage (27Jackson M.W. Berberich S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Shvarts A. Steegenga W.T. Riteco N. van Laar T. Dekker P.

However, induction of ARF by oncogenic stimuli, such as deregulated Myc expression (31Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar), and its subsequent regulation of Mdm2 may be affected differentially in tissues expressing high levels of MdmX. The resulting antagonistic effect of MdmX on ARF may weaken the ability of ARF to sequester Mdm2, resulting in more rapid Mdm2 and p53 turnover and an inactivation of p53 function. Consistent with this hypothesis, a small percentage of human gliomas contain an amplified mdmX gene without p53 mutation or mdm2 gene amplification. Furthermore, gliomas containing amplified mdmX showed no accumulation of p53 or Mdm2 protein (32Riemenschneider M.J. Buschges R. Wolter M. Reifenberger J. Bostrom J. Kraus J.A. Schlegel U. Reifenberger G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6091-6096PubMed Google Scholar). We are presently exploring the possibility that ARF-MdmX interactions in these tumors produce this malignant phenotype. Although our original model outlined MdmX as an inhibitor of Mdm2-mediated degradation (22Jackson M. Berberich S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the data presented here argue that MdmX together with ARF may act antagonistically to allow more rapid Mdm2 turnover (Fig. 7). Most likely, both mechanisms are utilized to maintain steady state levels of Mdm2 and p53 in normal cells. It is also possible that the interaction between MdmX and ARF affects pathways other than those relating to p53 and Mdm2. In fact, exogenously expressed ARF can induce a cell cycle arrest in triple knock-out cells lacking p53, mdm2, and ARF (33Weber J.D. Jeffers J.R. Rehg J.E. Randle D.H. Lozano G. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Zambetti G.P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Mdm2 binding domain of ARF, amino acids 1–14, is required for ARF to induce an arrest in a p53/Mdm2 null background. Although it is tempting to speculate that ARF interacts with MdmX or similar Mdm2-like proteins to reverse the inhibition of a yet unidentified protein, further studies into the effects of ARF-MdmX interactions in the absence of Mdm2 remain to be completed. We thank Dr. Madhavi Kadakia for reviewing the manuscript and providing us with the V5-MdmX expression vector."

Individuals who coinherit a L185Pperipherin-2 mutation and a null or G113Erom-1 mutation are afflicted with retinitis pigmentosa, whereas individuals who inherit only one defective gene are normal. We examined the expression, subunit assembly, and disulfide-mediated oligomerization of L185P and L185A peripherin-2 and L188P Rom-1 by velocity sedimentation, co-immunoprecipitation, and cross-linking. These mutants formed noncovalent dimers under disulfide-reducing conditions but failed to assemble into core tetramers.

L185P coassembled with wild-type peripherin-2 and Rom-1 to form tetramers and higher order disulfide-linked oligomers characteristic of the wild-type proteins. The G113E Rom-1 mutant expressed 20-fold lower than wild-type Rom-1, indicating that it behaves mechanistically as a null allele. We conclude that Leu185 of peripherin-2 (Leu188 of Rom-1) is critical for tetramer but not dimer formation and that the core tetramer has 2-fold symmetry.

In contrast, Rom-1 plays a more ancillary role in outer segment structure, since homozygous Rom-1 knockout mice develop outer segments that are only mildly altered in appearance (10Clarke G.

They are 35% identical in sequence and contain four putative membrane-spanning segments, a large intradiscal loop that connects the third and fourth transmembrane segments, and a relatively long C-terminal segment on the cytoplasmic side of the disc membrane (Fig.1) implicated in membrane fusion (12Boesze-Battaglia K. Lamba O.P. Napoli Jr., A.A. Sinha S. Guo Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9477-9487Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The large intradiscal loop contains seven conserved cysteine residues. One cysteine, Cys150, forms intermolecular disulfide bonds, whereas the other six cysteine residues contribute to protein folding presumably through intramolecular disulfide bonds (13Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Peripherin-2 and Rom-1 subunits interact noncovalently to form a mixture of homo- and heterotetrameric core complexes (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol.

Peripherin-2-containing core complexes can link together through Cys150-mediated disulfide bonds to form higher order oligomers, which are thought to play a key role in the formation and stabilization of the hairpin rim region of outer segment discs (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In support of this concept, Wrigley et al. (17Wrigley J.D. Ahmed T. Nevett C.L.

Mutations in the Prph2 gene have been linked to a variety of human retinal degenerative diseases including autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (RP), macular dystrophy, and related pattern dystrophies (18Farrar G.J.

Heterologous expression studies have shown that some of these mutations cause misfolding of peripherin-2 and defective subunit assembly (13Goldberg A.F. Loewen C.J. Molday R.S.

Individuals who inherited both a L185P mutation in a peripherin-2 allele and a null or G113E mutation in a rom-1 allele are severely affected with RP, whereas family members who inherit only one of these mutations are essentially normal. Biochemical studies have shown that the L185P peripherin-2 mutant assembles with Rom-1 to form core heterotetrameric complexes, but unlike WT peripherin-2, it is unable to self-assemble into core homotetramers (15Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In order to understand the molecular basis of digenic autosomal dominant RP, we have carried out a detailed study of several peripherin-2 and Rom-1 mutants. Here, we show that the L185P peripherin-2 mutant self-assembles into dimers that can further associate through intermolecular disulfide bonds to form tetramers but not higher order oligomers characteristic of WT peripherin-2. The L185P mutant, however, can interact with WT Rom-1 and WT peripherin-2 to form core tetramers and higher order disulfide-linked oligomers. Together, these studies provide new insight into the quaternary organization of the peripherin-2 and Rom-1 complexes and mechanisms that contribute to autosomal dominant digenic RP. pcPer (WTperipherin-2), pcPer-L185P (L185P peripherin-2), and pcROM (WT rom-1) have been described (5Moritz O.L.

Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). pcPer1D4, containing a 1D4 epitope tag, TETSQVAPA, at the C terminus was created by ligating an oligonucleotide corresponding to the 1D4 epitope onto the 3′-end of the peripherin-2 cDNA. A Q341P change that abolishes the binding of monoclonal antibody 2B6 was also introduced into this construct by site-directed mutagenesis. pcL185P-1D4 (pcPer1D4 with the L185P mutation) was created by cloning the BamHI–SacII restriction fragment from pcPer-L185P into BamHI–SacII-digested pcPer1D4. COS-1 cells (∼6 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected with a total of 30 μg of plasmid DNA and harvested 72 h post-transfection as described (25Goldberg A.F. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14213-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic analysis of the L185P mutant under reducing conditions was carried out as described previously for wild-type peripherin-2 (27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Briefly, pcPer-L185P transfected cells were solubilized in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmDTT, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used to determine the hydrodynamic properties of the detergent-solubilized complex. The Stokes radius was determined by gel exclusion chromatography on a calibrated Sephacryl S-300 column. Velocity sedimentation analysis was performed by centrifugation at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 49,000 rpm for 13 h on sucrose gradients in H2O and 28 h for gradients in D2O. Fractions were collected and analyzed on Western blots. Calibration protein standards (Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient (Svedbergs), partial specific volume) were cytochrome c (1.7 nm, 1.9 S, 0.728 ml/g), malate dehydrogenase (3.5 nm, 4.32 S, 0.734 ml/g), aldolase (4.6 nm, 7.70 S, 0.742 ml/g), and apoferritin (6.7 nm, 17.7 S, 0.73 ml/g) (28Worthington Biochemical Corp.

The molecular mass of the detergent-protein complex and the molecular mass of the protein portion were calculated according to the method of Clarke (31Clarke S. Smigel M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the values used for the sedimentation coefficient (sT,m), the density (ρT,m), and the viscosity (ηT,m) are experimentally determined values at the run temperature (subscript T) and in sucrose gradients in H2O or D2O (subscript m). The sedimentation coefficient (sT,m) was determined from the following relationship,ST,m=r−ro/tω2ravgEquation 1 where r is the distance of the protein at timet from the center of rotation, ro is the initial radial position, ω is the angular rotation, andravg is the average radial position defined byravg = (ro +r)/2. The density (ρT,m) at ravg was determined by interpolation of the measured densities of the 5 and 20% sucrose/H2O and sucrose/D2O solutions. The linearity of the gradients was confirmed by measuring the refractive index of the gradient fractions. The average viscosity ηT,m experienced by the marker proteins was determined from Equation 2 using the published values for (s20,w) and (v̄) for the standards.

The cells were solubilized with an equal volume (150 μl) of PBS containing 2% Triton X-100, 80 mm NEM, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4) for 10 min on ice. In some experiments, NEM was substituted with 1 mm DTT in the solubilization buffer. The cell extract was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatant (solubilized fraction) was retained on ice for analysis. Peripherin-2 was purified from the solubilized fraction on a Per2B6-Sepharose immunoaffinity matrix as previously described (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Purified peripherin-2 was applied to 5–20% (w/w) sucrose gradients prepared in PBS and containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (15Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After centrifugation for 16 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor at 4 °C, the bottom of the centrifuge tube was punctured, and four-drop fractions were collected for analysis by Western blotting. This procedure was used to determine apparent sedimentation coefficients for comparative purposes. Samples were denatured with an equal volume of SDS mixture (4% SDS, 0.02m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) in the absence (nonreducing) or presence (reducing) of 5% β-mercaptoethanol and applied to 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. Blots were probed with monoclonal antibodies to peripherin-2 (Per2B6) (1Molday R.S. Hicks D. Molday L. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 50-61PubMed Google Scholar), Rom-1 (Rom1C6), or rhodopsin (Rho1D4) (33MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin-peroxidase for detection by ECL. The Rom1C6 monoclonal antibody was generated to a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the intradiscal loop region of Rom-1 (5Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 352-362PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed on Triton X-100-solubilized samples with 0.001% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. Previous studies have shown that under reducing conditions (with DTT), the sedimentation coefficient of the L185P peripherin-2 mutant is significantly smaller than that of the tetrameric WT peripherin-2 core complex (15Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13726-13730Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine how the sedimentation behavior of this mutant relates to its molecular mass, we carried out a hydrodynamic study of the COS-1 cell-expressed L185P protein under reducing conditions. As shown in Fig.2 A, the L185P mutant eluted from a calibrated gel exclusion column as a single species with a Stokes radius of 4.83 ± .29 nm (n = 5), a value that is significantly lower than the value of 6.2 nm previously measured for the WT peripherin-2 complex (27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficient and partial specific volume of the L185P mutant were determined by velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients containing H2O and D2O (Fig. 2 B). A single detergent-protein species was observed in each case resulting in as20,W value of 2.78 ± 0.06 S (n = 8) and a partial specific volume of 0.82 ml/g. There was no difference between the sedimentation profiles of unpurified and immunoaffinity-purified complex (data not shown). Furthermore, since the partial specific volume of L185P peripherin-2 was similar to the native complex from rod outer segments (0.83 ml/g for native complex (27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)), the L185P mutant bound similar amounts of detergent as the native complex, indicating that it was not grossly misfolded. Using the values determined for Stokes radius, sedimentation coefficient, and partial specific volume, a molecular mass of 91 kDa was calculated for the L185P detergent-protein complex according to the method of Clarke (31Clarke S. Smigel M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using an average value for the partial specific volume for protein (0.74 ml/g) and the value for the detergent Triton X-100 (0.94 ml/g) and assuming additivity of partial specific volumes for protein and detergent, the molecular mass was estimated to be 54 kDa for the detergent-free L185P protein complex. This value is intermediate between a L185P monomer (39 kDa) and dimer (78 kDa) but considerably less than the experimental value of 135 kDa previously measured for the native peripherin-2 tetramer (calculatedMr = 152,000) from rod outer segments (27Goldberg A.F. Molday R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6144-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To determine if the L185P mutant exists as a monomer or a dimer, we carried out a series of coimmunoprecipitation studies with the L185P mutant and a related L185P-1D4 mutant. The L185P mutant is recognized by monoclonal antibody Per2B6; the L185P-1D4 mutant contains a 9-amino acid C-terminal epitope tag recognized by monoclonal antibody Rho1D4 and a Q341P mutation (Pro at position 341 is found in mouse peripherin-2) that abolishes Per2B6 immunoreactivity. We first determined if the individually expressed L185P and L185P-1D4 proteins were able to interact to form a stable complex. As shown in Fig. 3 A, when detergent-solubilized L185P and L185P-1D4 were mixed together and immunoprecipitated with Per2B6-Sepharose under disulfide-reducing conditions, L185P-1D4 mutant was eluted in the unbound fraction, whereas the L185P mutant was only present in the bound faction. This result indicates that individually expressed L185P and L185P-1D4 proteins do not associate to form a complex. This experiment also demonstrates that the Per2B6-Sepharose matrix selectively binds the L185P mutant but not the L185P-1D4 mutant. To determine if L185P and L185P-1D4 mutants can coassemble into a multisubunit complex, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with the L185P and L185P-1D4 plasmids. The cells were treated with DTT to reduce intermolecular disulfide bonds and subsequently solubilized in Triton X-100 in the presence of NEM to block free sulfhydryl groups (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The detergent-solubilized extract was applied to a Per2B6-Sepharose column, and the unbound and bound (peptide-eluted) fractions were analyzed for L185P and L185P-1D4 by Western blotting. Fig. 3 B shows that all of the L185P protein bound to the Per2B6-Sepharose matrix. Approximately 50% of the L185P-1D4 protein coprecipitated with the L185P peripherin-2. The isolated L185P·L185P-1D4 complex was further analyzed by velocity sedimentation (Fig. 3 C). The major complex had an apparent sedimentation coefficient that was similar to the individually expressed L185P (Table I). Additional complex was apparent near the bottom of the tube. This most likely represents L185P·L185P-1D4 aggregates that form during the immunoaffinity purification procedure.Table IVelocity sedimentation of peripherin-2 and rom-1 core complexesSpeciess20,wCore complexSWT peripherin-2 1-aValue previously reported (13).5.36 ± 0.14 (n = 3) 1-bn is the number of independent experiments.HomotetramerWT Rom-14.56 ± 0.28 (n = 6)HomotetramerWT peripherin-2–1D45.14 (n = 1)HomotetramerL185P peripherin-2 1-cValue previously reported (15) was recalculated using corrected parameters as described in Ref. 13.3.64 ± 0.19 (n = 3)HomodimerL185A peripherin-23.69 ± 0.31 (n = 3)HomodimerL185P · L185P-1D4 peripherin-23.67 ± 0.15 (n = 3)HeterodimerL185P peripherin-2 · L188P Rom-13.24 (n = 2)HeterodimerL188P Rom-13.09 ± 0.23 (n = 5)HomodimerProteins expressed in COS-1 cells were solubilized in Triton X-100, applied to 5–20% sucrose gradients, and sedimented for 16 h at 50,000 rpm and 4 °C in a Beckman TLS-55 rotor under reducing conditions.

Fractions were analyzed on Western blots. Finally, we determined if glutaraldehyde could cross-link the purified L185P mutant into a dimer. As shown in Fig. 3 D, a significant fraction of detergent-solubilized L185P peripherin-2 migrated as a dimer (∼67 kDa) after treatment with glutaraldehyde. This provides additional evidence that L185P is a multisubunit complex, minimally a dimer. Taken together, the hydrodynamic analysis, coimmunoprecipitation, and cross-linking studies provide strong evidence that the L185P peripherin-2 mutant exists as a dimer under disulfide-reducing conditions. To further evaluate the role of leucine at position 185 on the subunit assembly of peripherin-2, we analyzed the sedimentation behavior of a L185A mutant under disulfide-reducing conditions. The L185A mutant, like L185P, sedimented as a single species having an apparent sedimentation coefficient characteristic of a dimer (Fig.4 A; Table I). This mutant also coassembled with Rom-1 into a tetrameric core complex (data not shown). Rom-1 contains a leucine residue at an equivalent position (Leu188). The L188P Rom-1 mutant sedimented as a single species with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 3.09 S, a value that is considerably less than that of WT Rom-1 tetramer and consistent with a dimer (Fig. 4 B; Table I). To determine if L185P peripherin-2 can assemble with L188P Rom-1, COS-1 cells coexpressing the L185P peripherin-2 and L188P Rom-1 were treated with DTT, and the detergent-solubilized extract was immunoprecipitated with Per2B6 Sepharose. Fig. 5 Cshows that a significant fraction of L188P Rom-1 coprecipitated with L185P peripherin-2. This isolated complex sedimented with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 3.24 S (Table I), a value intermediate between a L185P homodimer (s20,w = 3.64 S) and a L188P homodimer (s20,w = 3.09 S) and consistent with heterodimer formation. The WT peripherin-2 core tetramer forms higher order, disulfide-linked oligomers under nonreducing conditions (14Loewen C.J. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5370-5378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To determine if the L185P peripherin-2 dimer also forms disulfide-linked oligomers, COS-1 cells expressing the L185P mutant were treated with NEM and solubilized in Triton X-100 in the absence of DTT. The soluble extract was subjected to velocity sedimentation, and fractions were analyzed on nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5, Aand B). The velocity sedimentation profile showed two distinct species. One species (a) had an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 3.62 S, a value similar to the value for reduced L185P (Table I); this species was composed solely of monomers when analyzed on nonreducing SDS gels. A second species (b) had an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 5.22 S, a value that is similar to that observed for WT tetrameric peripherin-2 core species (Table I); this species contained disulfide-linked dimers. These results indicate that two L185P peripherin-2 core dimers can link together through intermolecular disulfide bonds to form a tetrameric complex. However, this complex does not"

We have now characterized the role of one of the up-regulated genes,chop (gadd153), in the effect of autocrine production of hGH on mammary carcinoma cell number. The effect of autocrine production of hGH on the level of CHOP mRNA was exerted at the transcriptional level as autocrine hGH increased chloramphenicol acetyltransferase production from a reporter plasmid containing a 1-kilobase pair fragment of the chop promoter. The autocrine hGH-stimulated increase in CHOP mRNA also resulted in an increase in CHOP protein. As a consequence, autocrine hGH stimulation of CHOP-mediated transcriptional activation was increased. Stable transfection of human CHOP cDNA into mammary carcinoma cells demonstrated that CHOP functioned not as a mediator of hGH-stimulated mitogenesis but rather enhanced the protection from apoptosis afforded by hGH in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner.

In human mammary gland, hGH mRNA identical to pituitary hGH is also expressed by normal tissue and by benign and malignant tumoral tissue, immunoreactive hGH being restricted to epithelial cells (2Mol J.A.

The pituitary and mammary gland GH gene transcripts originate from the same transcription start site but are regulated differentially, since mammary gland GH gene transcription does not require Pit-1 (3Lantinga-van Leeuwen I.S.

Both endocrine GH and autocrine/paracrine-produced GH therefore possess the capacity to exert a direct effect on the development and differentiation of mammary epithelia in vitro (11Plaut K. Ikeda M. Vonderhaar B.K. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1843-1848Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in vivo (12Feldman M. Ruan W. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Kleinberg D.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1602-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have recently generated a model system to study the role of autocrine-produced hGH in mammary carcinoma by stable transfection of either the hGH gene or a translation-deficient hGH gene into mammary carcinoma (MCF-7) cells (13Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The autocrine hGH-producing cells display a marked insulin-like growth factor-1-independent increase in cell number in both serum-free and serum-containing conditions as well as a specific increase in STAT5-mediated transcription (13Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The increase in mammary carcinoma cell number as a consequence of autocrine production of hGH is a result of both increased mitogenesis and decreased apoptosis and is dependent on the activities of both p44/42 and p38 MAP kinases (14Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W.F. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Also, autocrine hGH production results in enhancement of the rate of mammary carcinoma cell spreading on a collagen substrate (15Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1571-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of the studied effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell behavior are mediated via the hGH receptor (14Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W.F. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells may direct mammary carcinoma cell behavior to impact on the final clinical prognosis.One major mechanism by which GH affects cellular function is by regulating the level of specific mRNA species (16Isaksson O.G. Eden S. Jansson J.O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 483-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that many of the effects of autocrine hGH on mammary carcinoma cell function are mediated by specific regulation of certain genes. Here we have used a cDNA microarray to identify some hGH-regulated genes that may be of importance in mediating the apparently pleiotropic effects of hGH on mammary carcinoma cell function. One gene that was observed to be up-regulated by the autocrine production of hGH waschop (C/EBP homologous protein) otherwise known as growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (gadd153).gadd153/chop encodes a small nuclear protein that dimerizes with members of the C/EBP family of transcription factors (17Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). It has been observed that CHOP protein influences gene expression as both a dominant negative regulator of C/EBP binding to one class of DNA targets and positively by directing CHOP-C/EBP heterodimers to alternate sequences (18Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHOP has also been demonstrated to tether to members of the immediate-early response, growth-promoting transcription factor family, JunD, c-Jun, and c-Fos resulting in transactivation of AP-1 target genes (19Ubeda M. Vallejo M. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7589-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). CHOP-mediated transcriptional activation in response to stress requires phosphorylation of CHOP by p38 MAP kinase (20Wang X.Z. Ron D. Science. 1996; 272: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), and we have recently demonstrated that GH stimulates CHOP-mediated transcription in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with GH receptor cDNA (21Zhu T. Lobie P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2103-2114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing cells and animals with a targeted deletion of the chop gene have implicated CHOP in programmed cell death in response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (22Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), and overexpression of CHOP in growth factor-dependent 32D myeloid precursor cells (23Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3250-3256PubMed Google Scholar) also results in apoptosis. CHOP protein has recently been demonstrated to be up-regulated by erythropoietin (24Coutts M. Cui K. Davis K.L. Keutzer J.C. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in erythroid differentiation (25Cui K. Coutts M. Stahl J. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7591-7596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).We have therefore proceeded to characterize the role of CHOP in the regulation of mammary carcinoma cell number in response to hGH. We first demonstrate that autocrine production of hGH up-regulates cellular CHOP mRNA and protein levels resulting in enhanced CHOP-mediated transcription in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that forced expression of CHOP offers dramatic protection from apoptotic cell death in mammary carcinoma cells stimulated with hGH. Thus transcriptional up-regulation ofchop is one mechanism by which hGH regulates mammary carcinoma cell number.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in specific increases and decreases in the level of different mRNA species. A number of the regulated genes may be of importance in mediating the effects of hGH on mammary carcinoma cell behavior, and further work should delineate how these genes integrate the response of the cell to hGH. What also needs to be determined is the mechanism and sequential order by which these genes are regulated by hGH. For example, we have observed here that the retinoic acid-regulated transcription factor HOXA-1 is dramatically up-regulated in response to autocrine production of hGH. Several target genes of HOXA-1 have recently been described (36Shen J. Wu H. Gudas L. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 25: 274-283Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) of which some have also been demonstrated to be hGH-regulated. These include superoxide dismutase (this study),SAP-18 (from differential display analysis of MCF-MUT and MCF-hGH) 3H. C. Mertani, E. L. K. Goh, and P. E. Lobie, unpublished data. andbmp-4 (37Li H.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3855-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).We have observed that the ski oncogene is approximately 4-fold up-regulated in response to autocrine production of hGH. The products of the cellular (c-Ski) and retroviral (v-Ski)ski genes are nuclear proteins that either activate or repress transcription depending on both the cellular and promoter context (38Barkas A.E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5489-5500Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). c-Ski and v-Ski do not bind DNA on their own but participate in a multiprotein signaling complex resulting in transcriptional repression required for cellular transformation (43Nicol R. Zheng G. Sutrave P. Foster D.N. Stavnezer E. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that Ski associates with both Smad2 and Smad3 resulting in repression of TGF-β-responsive promoters via the Smad-binding element (45Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The TGF-β pathway usually functions to suppress cellular proliferation and cellular transformation. It has been proposed that the repression of TGF-β-inducible genes (which function as negative regulators of cell cycle function) may be pivotal to the cellular transforming ability of Ski (45Xu W. Angelis K. Danielpour D. Haddad M.M. Bischof O. Campisi J. Stavnezer E. Medrano E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5924-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In this regard, it is also interesting that we have observed that the gene for PTGF-β, the product of which functions via the TGF-β receptor (46Tan M. Wang Y. Guan K. Sun Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is down-regulated in response to autocrine production of hGH. 4R. Graichen, Y. Sun, K. O. Lee, and P. E. Lobie, manuscript in preparation. Thus autocrine hGH production by mammary carcinoma cells acts in concert to both induce negative regulators and suppress positive regulators of the TGF-β pathway.We have observed here that the β-catenin gene is approximately 4-fold up-regulated by the autocrine production of hGH. β-Catenin is a pivotal component of the Wnt signaling pathway and has been implicated in embryonic development and carcinogenesis. Normally, cytosolic β-catenin is sequestered by the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product which promotes β-catenin degradation and by cadherins which integrate β-catenin into adherens junctions (47Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). Wnt signal activation results in stabilization of β-catenin (48Giarre M. Semenov M.V. Brown A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 23: 43-55Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49Shimizu H. Julius M.A. Giarre M. Zheng Z. Brown A.M. Kitajewski J. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1349-1358PubMed Google Scholar) and subsequent translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus where it binds to T cell factor class transcription factors resulting in expression of T cell factor-responsive genes (50Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Kolligs F.T. Hu G. Dang C.V. Fearon E.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5696-5706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is now clear that deregulation of Wnt signal transduction is associated with tumorigenesis. Truncations of the APC protein are linked to the familial adenomatous polyposis coli syndrome and are found in the majority of sporadic colon carcinomas (52Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar, 53Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar). Similarly APCmin (a mutation of the murine apc gene) mice have an increased incidence not only of intestinal neoplasia but also carcinoma of the mammary gland (54Moser A.R. Mattes E.M. Dove W.F. Lindstrom M.J. Haag J.D. Gould M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and an APC truncation has also been reported in a human breast cancer cell line (55Schlosshauer P.W. Brown S.A. Eisinger K. Yan Q. Guglielminetti E.R. Parsons R. Ellenson L.H. Kitajewski J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1453-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). High Wnt gene expression (Wnt-2, Wnt-4, and Wnt-7b) has also been reported in proliferative disorders of the human breast, and overexpression of Wnt-1 and Wnt-3 in the murine mammary gland results in mammary hyperplasia and an increased incidence of mammary gland tumors (56Huguet E.L. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2615-2621PubMed Google Scholar). One of the targets of β-catenin-stimulated gene expression in the human mammary gland is cyclin D1 (57Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). High β-catenin activity also significantly correlated with a poor clinical prognosis and could serve as a prognostic marker for breast cancer (57Lin S.Y. Xia W. Wang J.C. Kwong K.Y. Spohn B. Wen Y. Pestell R.G. Hung M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Whether the autocrine hGH increase in β-catenin mRNA also results in increased β-catenin protein and transactivation is currently under investigation. Should it do so, then hGH regulation of β-catenin transactivation would represent a novel mechanism of hormonal signal transduction and also provide a mechanism by which hGH excess results in carcinoma. In this regard it is interesting that the most common cancer in acromegaly is carcinoma of the colon (58Orme S.M. McNally R.J. Cartwright R.A. Belchetz P.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1998; 83: 2730-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) where a potential hGH-stimulated increase in β-catenin may be a contributing factor.We have previously demonstrated that autocrine production of hGH in mammary carcinoma cells results in a higher level of STAT5-mediated transcription (13Kaulsay K.K. Mertani H.C. Tornell J. Morel G. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 35-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 14Kaulsay K.K. Zhu T. Bennett W.F. Lee K.O. Lobie P.E. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting that we observed the level of YY1 mRNA to be decreased in response to autocrine production of hGH. YY1 has been demonstrated to associate with STAT5 after GH stimulation of hepatocytes (59Bergad P.L. Towle H.C. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8114-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and mutation of the YY1 site situated between the two γ-activated sequence sites (STAT5-binding site) of the GH-responsive element of the serine protease inhibitor 2.1 promoter results in diminished transcriptional activity (59Bergad P.L. Towle H.C. Berry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8114-8120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, for β-casein which is also a STAT5-regulated gene, YY1 represses transcription since the YY1 site overlaps a γ-activated sequence site (60Meier V.S. Groner B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 128-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 61Raught B. Khursheed B. Kazansky A. Rosen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1752-1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PRL (and presumably GH) relieves the repression of YY1 to stimulate transcription. Autocrine hGH may therefore regulate the level of YY1 to influence specifically STAT5-mediated gene transcription-dependent on whether YY1 is acting as an enhancer or repressor of STAT5-mediated gene transcription through a particular promoter. This would allow the possibility that autocrine hGH could regulate a specific set of genes separate from those regulated by exogenously applied or “endocrine” hGH.Autocrine production of hGH by mammary carcinoma cells results in a transcriptional up-regulation of chop gene expression (this study). This increase in chop gene expression translates into higher cellular levels of CHOP protein with a consequent increase in CHOP-mediated transcription. CHOP has previously been implicated in the control of cell division since its forced overexpression in different cell types results in growth arrest (62Barone M.V. Crozat A. Tabaee A. Philipson L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 453-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar,63Zhan Q. Lord K.A. Alamo Jr., I. Hollander M.C. Carrier F. Ron D. Kohn K.W. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Fornace Jr., A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2361-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) or apoptosis (22Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar, 23Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3250-3256PubMed Google Scholar, 64Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Concordantly, embryonic fibroblasts obtained from mice with a targeted disruption of the chopgene are resistant to apoptotic stimuli (23Friedman A.D. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3250-3256PubMed Google Scholar), and the introduction of the chop gene into gastric cancer cells increases sensitivity to anti-neoplastic agents (65Kim R. Ohi Y. Inoue H. Aogi K. Toge T. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 1779-1783PubMed Google Scholar) by activation of AP-1-associated transcription (66Kim R. Ohi Y. Inoue H. Toge T. Anticancer Res. 1999; 19: 5399-5405PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a linear pathway resulting in apoptotic cell death has been described (64Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Thus, Fas receptor ligation results in consecutive activation of Rac1, p38 MAP kinase, and CHOP and subsequent apoptosis of Jurkat cells (64Brenner B. Koppenhoefer U. Weinstock C. Linderkamp O. Lang F. Gulbins E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22173-22181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It is apparent, however, that CHOP may have divergent functions dependent on cell type. Thus, CHOP functions as an inducible inhibitor of adipocytic differentiation in response to metabolic stress by interfering with the accumulation of adipogenic C/EBP isoforms (C/EBPα and -β) (67Batchvarova N. Wang X.Z. Ron D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an altered form of CHOP, TLS-CHOP, formed by reciprocal translocation of the chop gene and a gene encoding an RNA-binding protein is associated with human myxoid liposarcoma (68Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D. Nature. 1993; 363: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar,69Rabbitts T.H. Forster A. Larson R. Nathan P. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Erythropoietin has also been demonstrated to up-regulate CHOP to participate in the erythroid differentiation program (24Coutts M. Cui K. Davis K.L. Keutzer J.C. Sytkowski A.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cui K. Coutts M. Stahl J. Sytkowski A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7591-7596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that overexpression of CHOP in mammary carcinoma cells stimulated with hGH offers dramatic protection from apoptosis in a p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner. Such apparent dichotomous function has also been described for NF-κB which exhibits both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions dependent on cell type (70Lin B. Williams-Skipp C. Tao Y. Schleicher M.S. Cano L.L. Duke R.C. Scheinman R.I. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It has been observed that CHOP protein influences gene expression as both a dominant negative regulator of C/EBP binding to one class of DNA targets and positively by directing CHOP-C/EBP heterodimers to other sequences (18Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this observation may constitute the mechanism of its apparent dichotomous function. The survival function of CHOP in mammary carcinoma cells is concordant with a recent study in which the level of CHOP mRNA was demonstrated to be significantly higher in breast carcinoma than in normal tissue controls (71Arnal M. Solary E. Brunet-Lecomte P. Lizard-Nacol S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 545-548PubMed Google Scholar). It was postulated that chop overexpression may inhibit the cellular differentiation to facilitate mammary gland tumorigenesis (71Arnal M. Solary E. Brunet-Lecomte P. Lizard-Nacol S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 545-548PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is plausible that mammotrophic factors such as hGH in executing their physiological roles may simply utilize CHOP to mediate cell survival and that the subsequent failure to undergo programmed cell death, in situations of cellular injury associated with DNA damage, would result in carcinoma (72Hartwell L. Cell. 1992; 71: 543-546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting that the DNA-damaging effect of bleomycin in human lymphocytes is enhanced by hGH (73Cianfarani S. Tedeschi B. Germani D. Prete S.P. Rossi P. Vernole P. Caporossi D. Boscherini B. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 28: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); and hGH and the related hormone prolactin have both been implicated in the development of mammary carcinoma (74Wennbo H. Tornell J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that GH itself has also been reported to be both mitogenic and growth inhibitory depending on the cellular context (75Nam S.Y. Lobie P.E. Obesity Rev. 2000; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).It could be argued that the autocrine hGH induction of CHOP gene expression occurs simply as a result of ER stress. Stable transfection of the hGH gene into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells has been observed to result in amplification of the Golgi complex (76Rudick V.L. Rudick M.J. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 509-520PubMed Google Scholar). In response to an altered function of the ER, cells exhibit a modified pattern of gene expression encoding ER resident proteins (77Shamu C. Cox J. Walter P. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 56-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In yeast, this response has been termed the unfolded protein response and is a positive feedback loop by which unfolded proteins in the ER result in enhanced expression of components required for proper protein folding in the ER (77Shamu C.

The glycosylated protein (270 kDa) has 15 extracytosolic repeat domains containing distinct binding sites for phosphomannosyl residues and IGF-II in mammals and marsupials. Mannosylated proteins bind to domains 1–3 and 7–9 (4Dahms N.M. Brzycki-Wessell M.A. Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam B.

The remaining protein is present at the cell surface, where its extracellular domains can exist as monomers or dimers (7Byrd J.C. Park J.H. Schaffer B.S. Garmroudi F. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol.

Metab. 1988; 67: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and may be involved in limiting the availability of IGF-II. At the cell surface, IGF-IIR is involved in binding a variety of ligands, including IGF-II and mannosylated proteins, such as leukemia inhibitory factor, which are internalized and degraded (13Kornfield S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 307-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 14Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Raher S. Vusio P. Hoflack B. Jacques Y. Godard A. J. Biol.

IGF-IIR also interacts with the mannose 6-phosphate groups of glycosylated latent transforming growth factor-β1 (lTGF-β1), leading to removal of the side chains and activation to TGF-β1, a growth inhibitor (15Dennis P.A.

IGF-IIR also binds retinoic acid and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, but the specific function and position of binding is not known (17Kang J.X. Li Y. Leaf A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Recently, it was shown that the uptake of granzyme B in T cell-mediated cell death was dependent upon IGF-IIR, and it is suggested that IGF-IIR is the receptor for cytotoxic T-cell-induced cell death (1Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Evidence for an IGF-IIR signaling pathway is contradictory (19Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Giambarella U.

The mitogenic and cell survival signals of IGF-I and IGF-II primarily occur via the IGF-I and insulin receptors (21Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It is suggested that IGF-IIR is a tumor suppressor gene, since the loss of IGF-IIR leads to increased levels of the cell survival factor IGF-II and decreased levels of the growth suppressor TGF-β1 (22Zaina S. Newton V.S. Mukta R.P. Graham C.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3886-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); resistance to T cell-mediated apoptosis and increased circulating proteolytic enzyme levels would also be predicted. IGF-II is often overexpressed in tumors, and its supply has been shown to be important in the growth of murine and human tumors (23Hassan A.B. Howell J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1070-1076PubMed Google Scholar, 24Toretsky J.A. Helman L.J. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 149: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). IGF-IIR is mutated with frequent loss of heterozygosity within human hepatocellular, breast, lung, and colon tumors such that ligand binding is disrupted (25Byrd J.C. Devi G.R. de Souza A.T. Jirtle R.L. MacDonald R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24408-24416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, theIGF2R gene contains a poly(G) tract in exon 38, which is thought to be a common mutational target in gastric, colon, and endometrial tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies (26Souza R.F.

De Souza A.T. Finkelstein S. Jirtle R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10351-10355Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Mice with targeted disruption of the Igf2r gene are born 25–30% larger than control mice and have an ∼3-fold increase in serum IGF-II (21Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The phenotype can be rescued in crosses withIgf2 knockout mice, suggesting that there are no significant growth effects independent of IGF-II (29Ludwig T. Eggenschwiler J. Fisher P. D'Ercole A.J. Davenport M.L. Efstratiadis A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 517-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, expression of a soluble form of IGF-IIR delivered using a transgene under the control of the keratin 10 promoter suggested that there may be IGF-II-independent growth effects in certain tissues (30Zaina S. Squire S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28610-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The addition of purified and soluble IGF-IIR to primary rat hepatocytes decreased IGF-II-, epidermal growth factor-, and platelet-derived growth factor-dependent DNA synthesis (31Scott C.D. Weiss J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Moreover,IGF2R down-regulation increased both cell growth ratein vitro and tumor xenograft growth rate in vivo(32O'Gorman D.B. Costello M. Weiss J. Firth S.M. Scott C.D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5692-5694PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the high affinity interactions of IGF-IIR with its ligands and to investigate the effect of pH on IGF-II/receptor interaction, soluble and stable recombinant forms of the extracellular ligand binding region of IGF-IIR were generated. Domains 1–15 were constructed by cloning the 438-base pairXbaI/BamHI-digested PCR product amplified from the human IGF2R cDNA clone, J03528 (American Type Culture Collection) using jl1for (5′- GCTCTAGAGTCGACGGGGTCCACGCAGGCCCAGGCC-3′) at positions 252–273 and jl1rev (5′-CGGGATCCCTCTTCATCAAACACATAGC-3′ at positions 668–687 into pBluescript to produce pJL1. The 5.2-kbBglII/NruI fragment from IGF2RcDNA was cloned into pJL1 digested withBglII/SmaI, producing pJL2. The PCR fragment synthesized using primers jl2for (5′- TCGTGTGCAGGCCTGAGG-3′) at positions 4982–4999 and jl2rev (5′- GAAGACTCGA GTCGACCGTTCTGACAGCCCCTTGTGCATC-3′) at positions 7029–7052 was digested with StuI/XhoI. The resulting 2-kb fragment was cloned intoStuI/XhoI, digested pJL2, producing pJL3. pJL3 was digested with SalI, and the 6.8-kb fragment (positions 253–7052) containing IGF-IIR domains 1–15 was cloned into pEFBOS (33Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar) containing rat CD4 (M15768) leader sequence (nucleotides 1–133), domains 3 and 4 (nucleotides 681–1228) (34Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and a biotin-accepting peptide sequence (35Brown M.H. Boles K. van der Merwe P.A. Kumar V. Mathew P.A. Barclay A.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) (generous gift of Dr. Neil Barclay). A second plasmid containing domains 1–15 was constructed using pJL2 and the PCR fragment synthesized using primers jl3for (5′-CCCATAGATATCGGCCG-3′) at positions 5308–5324 and jl3rev (5′-GAAGAGTCGACAAGCCCACCCCCAGAGGACACACG-3′) at positions 6973–6998. The jl3for × jl3rev PCR fragment was digested using 5 units of SalI and 2.5 units ofEcoRV, and the resulting 1.7-kb fragment was cloned into pJL2, which had been digested with 2.5 units SalI andEcoRV to remove IGF2R nucleotides 5316–5633. This smaller domain 1–15 IGF2R fragment, corresponding to nucleotides 253–6998, was cloned into the same expression vector. Oligonucleotides jl4for (5′-GAAGAGTCGACACCTTTCGATCTGACTGAATGT-3′) at positions 4233–4254 and jl4rev (5′- GAAGAGTCGACTCCAACTTCTTTGGAGGGCAGACAAC-3′) at positions 6100–6125 were used to amplify IGF-IIR domains 10–13 cDNA. jl5for (5′- GAAGAGTCGACCATGAAGAGCAACGAGCATGAT-3′) at positions 4667–4689 and jl4rev amplified domains 11–13. jl5for and jl5rev (5′- GAAGAGTCGACATCCTCACTTCATCAGGACAGACGAC-3′) at positions 5524–5549 amplified domains 11 and 12. Domain 10–13, 11–13, and 11–12 PCR fragments were digested with SalI and cloned into the expression vector, producing p10–13, p11–13, and p11–12, respectively. A mutated version of 10–13 (10–13(I1572T)) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. jl6for (5′- GACCAGGAG TAGCGTGGGCA-3′) at positions 4854–4873 and jl6rev, the reverse complement of jl2for, amplified a 0.15-kb fragment. A single base change of T to G is shown in boldface type and underlined. jl7for (5′-GACTGCCAGGTCACCAAC-3′) at positions 4690–4707 and jl7rev, the reverse complement of jl6for, amplified a 0.18-kb fragment. The 0.15- and 0.18-kb fragments were combined in a tube and amplified using jl7for and jl6rev. The resulting 0.3-kb fragment was digested with BstEII and StuI and cloned into p10–13 in place of the nonmutated BstEII/StuI fragment. The restriction enzyme sites SalI andBstEII are shown by underlining; XhoI,BamHI, EcoRV, and StuI are shown in boldface type; and XbaI is shown in italic type.Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was added after heating all other components to 94 °C for 5 min. The reactions were then cycled 30 times through 94 °C for 2 min, 46 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. DNA sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. IGF-IIR constructs were transiently expressed in 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (36Chisholm V. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. IRL Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar) using 20 μg of DNA. Following transfection, the cells were grown for 5 days in serum-free conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mmglutamine and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin). Spent supernatant was collected, and cells were cleared by centrifugation. Cell lysis was performed according to Devi et al. (37Devi G.R. Byrd J.C. Slentz D.H. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein was detected using a CD4 sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (34Brown M.H. Barclay A.N. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and concentrated using Centriprep columns before biotinylation and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline. Constructs were analyzed on 6 and 10% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and Western blotting according to Sambrooket al., (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.52Google Scholar) using 1 μg/ml streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase polymer (Sigma) and Lumi-Phos (Pierce). All BIAcore experiments were performed on a BIAcore biosensor 2000 at 37 °C in HBS buffer (0.01 mHEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20) unless otherwise stated. Streptavidin was immobilized to a CM5 chip using EDC/NHS carbodimide coupling reagents (39Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). All kinetic measurements were performed with the biotinylated receptor construct bound as the immobilized acceptor molecule except where stated. The amount of protein immobilized for the kinetic analysis was based on Equation 1, Rmax=Molecular weight of ligandMolecular weight of receptor×Immobilization response×StoichiometryEquation 1 where Rmax is the maximum level of response and was set at ∼50–200 resonance units (Ru). 40 μl of sample was injected over immobilized protein at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. To determine stoichiometry, the flow cells were saturated with biotinylated protein. Ligand concentrations used were 17–270 nm human recombinant IGF-II (Gropep), 100 nm to 56 mm IGF-I, 35 mm insulin (Sigma), 10–1150 nm epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 1 and 2 (generous gift of Prof. John Heath), 50–100 nmlatent TGF-β1 (R & D Systems), and 10–20 nmβ-glucuronidase (generous gift of Prof. William Sly). Biotinylated IGF-II (Gropep) was immobilized onto a streptavidin-coated chip, and 10–13 and 10–13(I1572T) were passed over the chip. Affinities were calculated using BIAevaluation software. The pH of HBS was adjusted to 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5 using a combination pH electrode, PHM83 (Radiometer Ltd.) at room temperature. These buffers were used to dilute IGF-II and wash flow cells through before analysis. After exposure to each pH, flow cells were rinsed with HBS buffer (pH 7.4) using the wash command, and IGF-II diluted in HBS (pH 7.4) was passed over the chip. The sample size was between three and six samples, and S.E. was used. Samples where compared using directional Mann-Whitney nonparametric analysis. IGF-IIR chimeric proteins (Fig. 1) were constructed by amplifying IGF2R cDNA and restriction enzyme digestion. Domain boundaries were designed around those proposed by Lobel et al. (40Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and included two amino acids on either side of a domain. cDNA was cloned in frame with the rat CD4 leader sequence, CD4 domains 3 and 4, and a biotin-accepting peptide and expressed in 293T cells. The structure of rat CD4 domains 3 and 4 has been determined (41Brady R.L. Lange G. Barclay A.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 958-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and they have previously been found to be expressed at high levels when truncated (42Davis S.J. Ward H.A. Puklavec M.J. Willis A.C.

Barclay A.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5275-5282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Levels of expression were quantified by CD4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In relation to the rat CD4 control construct, which was expressed at 1 μg/μl, domains 10–13, 10–13(I1572T), and 11–12 were expressed at 10–15 ng/μl, but domains 1–15 (nucleotides 253–6998) were expressed at 0.8–2 ng/μl. Cell lysis techniques did not increase the yield of protein detected. The size of biotinylated domains 1–15, 10–13, 10–13(I1572T), and 11–12 conjugated to rat CD4 was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.2). The first chimeric protein containing domains 1–15 (nucleotides 253–7052) was not detectable in the spent supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot (data not shown) and was not used in further experiments.Figure 2A, biotinylated domains 1–15 and 10–13 and supernatant from nontransfected cells (S) were analyzed by Western blotting using a 6% polyacrylamide gel. B, biotinylated domains 10–13, 10–13(I1572T), 11–12, and CD4 were analyzed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Molecular weight standards are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interaction of recombinant IGF-IIR with IGF-II was measured using surface plasmon resonance techniques. To prevent mass transport limitations and ligand rebinding, the amount of immobilized ligand was kept to an Rmax of 50–200 Ru, and a high flow rate was used (44Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The association rate (ka) was measured as a function of the increase in Ru over time. Dissociation of IGF-II caused a decrease in Ru as IGF-II was removed by washing from the chip surface (kd). A plot of dRu/dt over Ru gave a linear response (data not shown), which suggests that mass transport was not a limiting factor in the analysis of IGF-II binding using 67 nm IGF-II. Domains 3 and 4 of CD4 and 10–13(I1572T) were used as controls once the failure to bind IGF-II was confirmed (Fig.3). All kinetic measurements of domains 1–15, 10–13, and 11–12 were subsequently performed after the subtraction of the Ru generated by 10–13(I1572T) to remove changes in signal arising from either the refractive index or nonspecific binding events. Measurement of the Rmax derived from steady state binding indicated that >90% of immobilized domains 10–13 and 11–13 were able to bind IGF-II. However, only 50–57% of immobilized domains 1–15 and 11–12 were active. 10–20 nmβ-glucuronidase and 50–100 nm latent TGF-β1 were passed over immobilized biotinylated constructs, and binding was observed with domains 1–15 but not domains 10–13 and domains 11–12 (data not shown). The association rates of latent TGF-β1 and IGF-II were found to be similar, but not for β-glucuronidase, which was ∼6-fold lower. Its dissociation from domains 1–15 was ∼16-fold slower than the dissociation of IGF-II and latent TGF-β1 (TableI).Table IAffinities of the IGF-IIR ligands to domains 1–15, 10–13, 11–13, and 11–12DomainsLigandka × 106kd × 10−2Kdm−1s−1s−1nm1–15β-Glucuronidase0.31 ± 0.180.075 ± 0.0012.4lTGF-β11.1 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.0212IGF-II1.4 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.31410–13IGF-II0.2 ± 0.092.4 ± 0.212011–13IGF-II0.2 ± 0.052.0 ± 0.310011–12IGF-II0.2 ± 0.029.0 ± 0.1450Biotinylated chimeras were immobilized onto biosensor chips, and ligand was passed over the chip at 40 μl/min, at 37 °C, pH 7.4.

Insulin, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factors 1 and 2, and IGF-I did not bind to any of the IGF-IIR constructs (data not shown), whereas IGF-II bound to domains 1–15, 10–13, 11–13, and 11–12 with high affinity at 37 °C, pH 7.4. Association and dissociation rates from domains 1–15, 10–13, 11–13, and 11–12 are shown in Table I. Since domain 10–13 and 11–13 bound IGF-II with similar affinity, domains 10–13 were used in later experiments. Biotinylated IGF-II was immobilized on a BIAcore chip. Nonbiotinylated 10–13 bound to the immobilized ligand with an affinity constant of 1.34 × 10−6m, which was ∼96-fold lower than the interaction between immobilized 10–13 and IGF-II. It is possible that a conformational change occurs in the IGF-II protein upon biotinylation such that interactions with receptor molecules are retained but at reduced affinity. Nonbiotinylated 10–13(I1572T) did not bind to immobilized biotinylated IGF-II (data not shown). The biosensor chip was washed with the appropriate pH buffer before 67 nm IGF-II diluted in the same buffer was passed over the immobilized IGF-IIR constructs. The amount of IGF-II binding was indicated by the Ru, since they are proportional to the analyte mass. Binding was measured at pH 7.4 after exposure to each low pH buffer. Decreasing pH did not significantly affect IGF-II association with domains 1–15 until pH 5.5, when the association rate was decreased ∼28-fold (TableII). At pH 6.5, the dissociation rate was significantly increased by 2-fold (p = 0.015), and the amount of IGF-II binding was significantly reduced (p = 0.04). No binding was detectable at pH 5.0 (Fig.4 A). Optimum affinity occurred at pH 7.4. The association rate and amount of IGF-II bound to immobilized domains 1–15 at pH 7.4 was not affected by previous exposure to low pH, since levels returned to those measured during the initial pH 7.4 measurements. The dissociation rate remained significantly higher (p = 0.03) when measured at pH 7.4 immediately after exposure to pH 6.5 and below (Fig.5 A).Table IIThe effect of pH on the interaction between IGF-II and IGF-IIR-CD4 chimeras containing domains 1–15, 10–13, and 11–12DomainsParameterspH7.47.06.56.05.55.01–15ka × 106 (m−1 s−1)1.4 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.081.3 ± 0.041.0 ± 0.20.05 ± 0.02kd × 10−2 (s−1)2.0 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.33.0 ± 0.036.0 ± 0.37.0 ± 0.5Kd(nm)14212360140010–13ka × 106 (m−1 s−1)0.2 ± 0.090.2 ± 0.020.2 ± 0.020.2 ± 0.010.1 ± 0.030.8 ± 0.1kd × 10−2 (s−1)2.4 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.032.0 ± 0.027.0 ± 0.0510.5 ± 2.012.3 ± 1.6Kd(nm)1201501003501050154011–12ka × 106 (m−1 s−1)0.2 ± 0.020.4 ± 0.090.4 ± 0.030.3 ± 0.070.3 ± 0.040.2 ± 0.1kd × 10−2 (s−1)9.1 ± 1.28.0 ± 0.57.7 ± 0.37.7 ± 0.36.3 ± 0.38.3 ± 0.4Kd(nm)46020019026021042067 nm IGF-II was passed over immobilized biotinylated domains 1–15, 10–13, and 11–12 at 37 °C.

Association rate (ka), dissociation rate (kd), and equilibrium (Kd) constants were determined using BIAevaluation software. Values represent the mean ± S.E. Unlike domains 1–15, binding of IGF-II to immobilized 10–13 was detectable at pH 5.0. The association rate of IGF-II was significantly decreased by 2-fold at pH 5.5 (p = 0.03), although at pH 5.0, the rate was increased by ∼4-fold (Table II). The dissociation rate and total amount of IGF-II bound was significantly decreased from pH 6.0 (p= 0.02) (Fig. 4 B). By pH 5.0, the dissociation rate and Ru had decreased 5-fold. Optimum affinity occurred between pH 7.4 and 6.5. The association and dissociation rate and amount of IGF-II binding did not return to previous values when measured at pH 7.4 following each stage of low pH exposure (Fig. 5 B). The association rate was significantly increased by 2-fold between pH 7.0 and 6.5 (Table II). In addition, the amount of bound IGF-II was also increased by 2-fold at pH 6.0 (p = 0.02). By pH 5.5, the dissociation rate was decreased, although only by 1.4-fold, and this was found not to be significant (Fig. 4 C). Optimum affinity occurred between pH 7.0 and 5.5. The association rate and amount of IGF-II binding did not return to previous values when measured at pH 7.4 following each low pH exposure (Fig. 5 C). Affinities of IGF-IIR-CD4 chimeras were measured using surface plasmon resonance, a method that enables measurement of protein interaction in real time, providing information on the amount of ligand bound and, unlike immunoblot analysis, association and dissociation rates. A biotin-accepting peptide sequence was included in the chimeras so that high affinity, stable immobilization of constructs could be achieved on a streptavidin-coated biosensor chip, since the affinity of streptavidin for biotin is on the order of 10−15m and is stable over a wide temperature and pH range (45Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R. Science. 1989; 24: 85-88Crossref Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). We confirmed that a point mutation at nucleotide position 4862, converting a T to C, altering the amino acid content from isoleucine to threonine in domain 11, abolished IGF-II binding (46Garmroudi F. Devi G. Slentz D.H. Schaffer B.S. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 642-651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was utilized as a control. Similar amounts of chimeric proteins containing domains 10–13 and 10–13(I1572T) were secreted, which suggests that the point mutation did not aberrantly affect protein structure such that secretion was affected. Human recombinant IGF-II bound to immobilized constructs with differing affinity. The affinity of domains 1–15 for IGF-II was 14 nm, compared with 120, 100, and 450 nm for domains 10–13, 11–13, and 11–12, respectively. The differences observed may be due to differing stability of the truncated proteins, steric hindrance at the chip surface, or missing IGF-II-binding enhancing domains. Domain 13, which is lacking in the domains 11–12 construct, is thought to enhance IGF-II binding (37Devi G.R. Byrd J.C. Slentz D.H. MacDonald R.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our data support this and suggest that domain 13 enhances IGF-II affinity by slowing its rate of release from the receptor. Domains 1–15 had the highest affinity for IGF-II, suggesting that other unknown IGF-II binding enhancing domains may also exist. Previously reported affinity values of IGF-II for full-length receptor have ranged from 0.2 to 5 nm for bovine IGF-IIR (47Valenzano K.J. Heath-Monnig E. Tollefsen S.E. Lake M. Lobel P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14975-14982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Differences may be due to experimental approach, since measurements have been determined both by affinity blots and surface plasmon resonance, with variations due to either the quality of purified proteins or stability of recombinant proteins. There may also be species and tissue differences for IGF-II receptor affinity (49Killian J.K. Byrd J.C. Jirtle J.V. Munday B.L. Stoskopf M.K. MacDonald R.G. Jirtle R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase and lTGF-β1 bound to immobilized domains 1–15 only. The affinity of this construct for β-glucuronidase was 2.4 nm, similar to previous values for the full-length purified, nonrecombinant receptor (50Fischer H.D. Gonzalez-Noriega A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5069-5074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domains 1–3 and 7–9 bound β-glucuronidase with affinities of 0.3 and 0.9 nm, respectively (51Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). lTGF-β1 had a faster association and dissociation rate than β-glucuronidase, presumably because of the number of mannosylated residues on each protein molecule. lTGF-β1 may bind to the IGF-IIR via mannose 6-phosphate groups located on the latency-associated protein (16Purchio A.F. Cooper J.A. Brunner A.M. Lioubin M.N. Gentry L.E. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. Marquardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14211-14215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases involved in the activation of lTGF-β1 remove the latency-associated protein, which may then be internalized for degradation (52Gleizes P.E. Munger J.S. Nunes I. Harpel J.G. Mazzieri R. Noguera I. Rifkin D.B. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is not understood how lTGF-β1 avoids trafficking to the lysosomes. The ∼17-fold faster dissociation rate of lTGF-β1 compared with β-glucuronidase may be one mechanism preventing lTGF-β1 from internalization and degradation before activation. Other factors may bind to the IGF-IIR-lTGF-β1 complex and prevent internalization. If these factors are not available, lTGF-β1 may dissociate before it is internalized. IGF-IIR is exposed to a range of pH environments in vivo, since it is involved in ligand internalization at the cell surface, protein sorting within the trans-Golgi network and transport to the endosomes (53Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). The membrane-bound receptor binds mannosylated proteins with maximal binding within a pH range of 6.5–7.5, and optimum binding of β-glucuronidase to domains 1–3 and 7–9 occurs at pH 6.9 and 6.4–6.5, respectively (50Fischer H.D. Gonzalez-Noriega A. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5069-5074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Marron-Terada P.G. Hancock M.K. Haskins D.J. Dahms N.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the 46-kDa cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which displays sequence similarity to each extracytoplasmic domain of IGF-IIR, displays weak binding at neutral pH and has a pH optimum at 6.0–6.3 (54Hoflack B. Fujimoto K. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 123-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Domains 10 and 13 may be involved in the pH dependence of IGF-II binding, since the optimum affinity of domains 11–12 had shifted downward compared with domains 1–15 and 10–13. However, domains other than 10, 11, 12, and 13 may also be involved, since domains 1–15 responded differently to changes in pH compared with domains 10–13 and domains 11–12. The exact structural features contributing to pH dependence of ligand binding and release is not known for either type of protein and awaits characterization of receptor structure bound to ligands. The reduction in association rate and amount of IGF-II bound to domains 1–15 at low pH was recovered by increasing the pH to 7.4, although dissociation was not. In contrast, the measured parameters affected by pH in domains 10–13 and domains 11–12 did not recover by reexposure to pH 7.4. Our data emphasize the stability of the extracellular domains 1–15 to repeated low pH exposure and perhaps suggest a role for the non-ligand binding domains of the receptor. Although the stability of IGF-IIR to pH exposure may be important during recycling, IGF-IIR may be continuously replaced from a pool once irreversible denaturation due to continuous low pH exposure has occurred. Evidence for a pool of IGF-IIR has been identified in Chinese hamster ovary cells, where labeled IGF-IIR was degraded with a half-life of 2.5–16 h (55Sahagian G.G. Neufeld E.F. J. Biol Chem. 1983; 258: 7121-7128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the expression of functional recombinant soluble IGF-IIR in human embryonic kidney cells and their immobilization onto biosensor chips provided a method for characterizing the extracytosolic repeat domains. We have demonstrated that domain 13 acts to slow the rate of IGF-II release but domains other than 10, 11, 12, and 13 are also necessary for optimum IGF-II binding at neutral pH and suggest a functional role for the nonbinding domains of the cation-independent IGF-IIR. We are grateful to William Sly and John Heath for generous gifts, and we thank Marion Brown, Neil Barclay, and Chris Graham for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1590146248,"Mammalian brain development requires the transmission of electrical signals between neurons via theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) class of glutamate receptors. However, little is known about how NMDA receptors carry out this role. Here we report the first genes shown to be regulated by physiological levels of NMDA receptor function in developing neuronsin vivo: NMDA receptor-regulated gene 1(NARG1), NARG2, and NARG3. These genes share several striking regulatory features. All three are expressed at high levels in the neonatal brain in regions of neuronal proliferation and migration, are dramatically down-regulated during early postnatal development, and are down-regulated by NMDA receptor function. NARG2 and NARG3 appear to be novel, while NARG1 is the mammalian homologue of a yeast N-terminal acetyltransferase that regulates entry into the Go phase of the cell cycle. The results suggest that highly specific NMDA receptor-dependent regulation of gene expression plays an important role in the transition from proliferation of neuronal precursors to differentiation of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1644044233,"This study was designed to investigate the mechanisms by which mutant versican constructs play a dominant-negative effect on astrocytoma cell proliferation. Although a mini-versican or a versican G3 construct promoted growth of U87 astrocytoma cells, a mini-versican lacking epidermal growth factor (EGF) motifs (versicanΔEGF) and a G3 mutant (G3ΔEGF) exerted a dominant-negative effect on cell proliferation. G3ΔEGF-transfected cells formed smaller colonies, arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, inhibited expression of cell cycle proteins cdk4 and cyclin D1, and contained multiple nucleoli. In cell surface binding assays, G3 products expressed in COS-7 cells and bacteria bound to U87 cell surface. G3ΔEGF products exhibited decreased binding activity, but higher levels of G3ΔEGF products were able to inhibit the binding of G3 to the cell surface. G3ΔEGF expression inhibited secretion of endogenous versican in astrocytoma cells and also inhibited the secretion of mini-versican in COS-7 cells co-transfected with the mini-versican and G3ΔEGF constructs. The effect seems to depend on the expression efficiency of G3ΔEGF, and it occurred via the carbohydrate recognition domain.

Versican, a member of the large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan family, was initially detected in the limb bud of chick embryo (1Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is also expressed in normal human central nervous system and brain tumors (6Paulus W. Baur I. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmerman D.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RT-PCR1reveals that transcripts of versican isoforms are present in astrocytomas, oligodendrocytomas, medulloblastomas, schwannomas, and meningiomas (6Paulus W. Baur I. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Zimmerman D.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Versican expression levels are low, however, because neuronal immunostaining for versican appears only pericellularly. Versican is highly expressed in the tissues flanking the regions where neural crest cells migrate in chick embryos, but it is absent from the actual migration pathways. Similar findings are noted for the outgrowing sensory and motor axons of chick embryos, because versican is notably absent in regions invaded by these axons (7Landolt R.M. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Zimmermann D.R. Development. 1995; 121: 2303-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Versican is known to associate with a number of molecules in the extracellular matrix such as hyaluronan, tenascin, and fibronectin (8Lebaron R.G. Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Perides G. Erickson H.P. Rahemtulla F. Bignami A. Anat.

Rahemtulla F. Bignami A. Anat. Embryol. 1993; 188: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Tenascin binds at the C-type lectin unit of versican (10Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc.

Structurally, versican is made up of an N-terminal G1 domain, a glycosaminoglycan attachment region, and a C terminus containing a selectin-like (or G3) domain. The latter contains two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats, a lectin-like motif (also known as carbohydrate recognition domain or CRD), and a complement binding protein (CBP)-like motif (3Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ito K. Shinomura T. Zako M. Ujita M. Kimata K. J. Biol.

Zimmerman D.R. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 528-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The role of versican in brain tumor formation and progression is not clear. We have previously demonstrated that a mini-versican construct promoted NIH 3T3 fibroblast proliferation through the G3 domain, and two EGF-like motifs in the G3 domain are involved in this effect (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Deletion of the EGF-like motifs from the mini-versican construct significantly reduced the effect of the mini-versican on cell proliferation and differentiation (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the mini-versican construct promotes astrocytoma cell proliferation through the G3 domain. To our surprise, deletion of these EGF-like motifs produced a dominant-negative effect on astrocytoma cell proliferation. We designed assays to uncover the mechanism associated with this dominant-negative effect. A G3 construct lacking the EGF-like motifs (G3ΔEGF) binds to the astrocytoma cell surface. This may have competed with endogenous versican for binding sites on the cell surface and blocked the function of versican in cell growth. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mutant construct inhibited secretion of endogenous versican in glioma cells and the mini-versican in COS-7 cells. These two mechanisms may account for the dominant-negative effect of the mutant on cell growth. It appears that the effects of the G3ΔEGF on cell growth are concentration-dependent and occurred via the CRD motif. Lipofectin, Geneticin (G418), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Hank's balanced salt solution, trypsin/EDTA were from Life Technologies, Inc. ECL Western blot detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Tissue culture plates were from Nunc Inc. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by BioBasic Inc. (Scarborough, Canada). All chemicals were from Sigma. Astrocytoma cell line U87 and COS-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (U87) or 5% (COS-7) FBS at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. A mini-versican gene consisting of a complete G1 domain, a partial CS domain (15% in size of the entire sequence) and a complete G3 domain was constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells. Briefly, the G1 domain encompasses nucleotides 145–1182 of versican. The CS sequence is a 1242-base pair cDNA (nucleotides 1183–2424 of versican). The G3 domain contains a 927-base pair cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 9904–10830 (3Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant mini-versican gene is 3.2 kilobases, which yields a core protein of ∼150 kDa. With the attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains, the recombinant proteoglycan migrated on SDS-PAGE gel as a smear, at around 200 kDa or higher. The preparation of three constructs, a mini-versican lacking the EGF-like motifs (versicanΔEGF), a G3 construct, and a G3 lacking the EGF-like motifs (G3ΔEGF), was described in detail earlier (17Zhang Y.

Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In all constructs used in this study, the link protein leading peptide was attached at the N terminus to allow product secretion (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Deak F. Kiss I. Sparks K.J. Argraves W.S. Hampikian G. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3766-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This leading peptide contains an epitope recognized by the monoclonal antibody 4B6 (20Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate CBP construct, CBP was synthesized using CBPN (5′-aaactcgaggttgcctgtggtcaacct) and G3C (5′-aaaaaagcatgcgcgccttgagtcctgccacgtcct) as primers in a PCR, and the product was digested with XhoI and SphI. The leading peptide was synthesized with LPN (5′-aaaaaagaattcctaagtctactctttctggtgctg) and LP60b (5′-aaactcgagaggcagtgtgacgttgcc) to generate an EcoRI restriction site at the N terminus and an XhoI site at the C terminus of the leading peptide. Thus, the leading peptide and the CBP fragment were inserted into EcoRI- andSphI-digested pcDNA1 plasmid. To produce the CRD construct, CRD was synthesized using CRDN (5′-aaactcgagcaagacacagagact) and CRDC (5′-aaatctagatgttcctttcttgcaggt) as primers in a PCR. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and XbaI and purified. The purified products were inserted into XhoI- andXbaI-digested CBP construct, in which the XhoI site was situated between the leading peptide and the CBP fragment, whereas the XbaI site was located at 3′ of theSphI site. The pcDNA1-mini-versican construct was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using Lipofectin as originally described by Felgner et al. (21Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W. Wenz M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. Danielsen M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7413-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar). Growth medium and cells were harvested separately 3 days after transfection. Expression of constructs was analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6 (20Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain stable expression, glioma cells were transfected with versicanΔEGF as previously described (22Ang L.C. Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Young B. Kiani C. Lee V. Allan K. Yang B.B. J. Neuropathol.

Cell Res. 2001; 263: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Geneticin was introduced into the growth medium (0.5 or 1.5 mg/ml) 24 h after transfection, and the cells were maintained in this medium until individual colonies were large enough for cloning. The selected cell lines were stored in liquid nitrogen or maintained in growth medium containing 0.5 mg Geneticin/ml for subsequent gene expression assays and functional studies. Cell lines were monitored to ensure expression of the transgene for the duration of functional studies. In co-transfection assays, equal amounts of the two constructs were mixed and used for the transfection. Cell lysate and growth medium that contained recombinant gene products were each subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and immunoblotting as described previously (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution, unless otherwise stated, and bound antibodies were visualized using an ECL kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Because of its large size, electrophoresis of endogenous versican was performed in an agarose gel (agarose-Western blot assay). The agarose gel (4 cm height containing 1.5% agarose in a buffer containing 0.124 mTris-Cl, 27 mm barbituric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.7) was poured on top of a 1-cm conventional 10% polyacrylamide gel, which served to seal the bottom of the casting apparatus. This buffer was also used as a running buffer, and the electrophoresis was carried out at 40 V for 5 h at room temperature. Molecules (up to 2 million daltons in size) were able to enter the agarose gel, as shown by use of blue dextran 2000 as an internal control. Growth media and lysate from the U87 cell line and human brain tumor tissues of equal protein concentrations were analyzed in the gel. To allow transfer of such large molecules onto the nitrocellulose membrane, the blotting took place in Tris-glycine buffer at 20 V overnight at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed as above. G3 recombinant proteins containing a N-terminal His tag were purified using Ni-NTA affinity columns (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar,25Pogge von Strandmann E. Zoidl C. Nakhei H. Holewa B. Pogge von Strandmann R. Lorenz P. Klein-Hitpab L. Ryffel G.U. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 732-735Google Scholar). Briefly, the G3 domain was expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15 using the bacterial expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA; catalog number 32149) as shown in Fig.1 A. The G3 domain was amplified in a PCR using two primers, 5′-aaaggatccggacaggatccatgcaaa and 5′-aaagcatgcgcgccttgagtcctgccacgt. The product was subcloned into pQE30, and the resulting construct contained an N-terminal MRGSHis tag. Peptides were purified on a Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen, catalog number 30230) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Growth media from COS-7 cells transfected with different recombinant constructs were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with native culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2.5% FBS), and the mixture was introduced into glioma cells cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 103cells/well. The cultures were maintained in an incubator for 3 days, and cell number was counted using a cytometer. To test the effects of the purified products on cell proliferation, glioma cells were plated on 96-well dishes at a density of 2–4 × 103cells/well, 200 μl/well. Purified products were added into each well (50 μl of column eluate/well). Lysate from vector-transfected bacteria was loaded onto Ni-NTA purification columns, and the eluate from these columns was used as a control. Cell proliferation was determined after 3 days of incubation. To test the effects of recombinant constructs on cell growth, glioma cells were transiently transfected with the constructs using the method described above. Four days after transfection, cells were counted. Cell lysate and culture medium were harvested for analysis of gene expression on Western blot. Cell proliferation was also tested in glioma cell lines stably transfected with versicanΔEGF construct and the control vector. Briefly, cells were seeded to 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 103 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The cultures were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C for 3 days, and cell number was counted as above. U87 cells were plated on 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 °C for 2 days. The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, the cells were collected with trypsin/EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) dissolved in 0.1% sodium citrate plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Glioma cells were seeded to six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. The cells were allowed to attach and grow overnight in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to reach 70% confluence. Cultures in each well were transfected with 0.5–1 μg of G3ΔEGF plasmid or a control vector (pcDNA3) accompanied by 8 μl of Lipofectin as described above. Two days after transfection, Geneticin was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. The media were changed every 5 days or earlier if necessary. Colonies of transfected cells were observed after 2 weeks. Astrocytoma cells transfected with the mutant G3 construct or the control vector (2.5 × 106 cells) were harvested, and total RNA were extracted with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit. RT-PCR assays were performed as previously described (18Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA, a portion of which (equal to 0.2 μg of RNA) was used in a PCR with two appropriate primers. PCR products were analyzed in agarose gel electrophoresis and detected using ethidium bromide staining. The primers for endogenous versican were 5′-ccagccccctgttgtagaaaa and 5′-gcgcctcgactcctgccacct (producing a product of 297 base pairs). The primers for G3ΔEGF transgene were 5′-aaactcgaggttgcctgtggtcaacct and 5′-aaatctagagcgccttgagtcctgcca (complementary to nucleotides 10519–10831 of versican encoding the CBP motif and the tail). The control primers were 5′-ccagagcaagagaggcatcc and 5′-ccgtggtggtgaagctgtag (complementary to β-actin nucleotides 247–683). Growth medium from COS-7 cells transfected with G3 or G3ΔEGF was incubated with glioma cells, which had been pretreated with hyaluronidase (165 units/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking for 3 h. The medium was removed after centrifugation (at 1000 × g), and the cells were washed with 10 ml of PBS with gentle shaking to prevent nonspecific interaction. The cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer. Cell extract was analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6 to detect the binding of G3 product and G3ΔEGF product to glioma cells. To test whether one product could compete with another for binding to glioma cells, 50 μl of peptides purified from bacteria was mixed with different amounts of competing medium (from G3- or G3ΔEGF-transfected COS-7 cells). Culture medium from vector-transfected COS-7 cells was used to bring the final volume to 2 ml. The mixture was incubated with glioma cells at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were washed as above, and cell lysate was prepared. Equal amounts of proteins from each treatment were analyzed on Western blot to estimate the binding of the above products to glioma cells. As well, culture media from COS-7 cells expressing G3 (200 μl) were mixed with 0, 500, or 1500 μl of culture media from G3ΔEGF-transfected COS-7 cells, and the competition assay was performed as above. Astrocytoma cells U87 were cultured on glass slips to 80% confluence. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with rabbit anti-versican polyclonal antibody, which we generated to recognize the CS sequence of the construct (17Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. 3′-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Sigma) was used for color development according to the manufacturer's instructions. The stained cells were examined with a light microscope and photographed. To examine the role of versican in glioma cell growth, we generated a mini-versican gene and a number of mutants (Fig.1 A). We first confirmed the expression of versican in human glioma sample using Western blot. Our purified polyclonal antibody, originally raised against chicken versican, recognized a proteoglycan migrating as a large smear in agarose gel, characteristic of large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (Fig. 1 B). Versican expression was also detected in the glioma cell line U87. The mini-versican gene was expressed in COS-7 cells, and its expression and secretion were confirmed by Western blot. Growth media from the mini-versican-, versicanΔEGF-, and vector-transfected COS-7 cells were collected and introduced into U87 glioma cell cultures. After 3 days, cell count indicated that the mini-versican enhanced cell proliferation compared with the control, whereas growth medium from versicanΔEGF-transfected cells exerted a dominant-negative effect, producing inhibition of glioma cell growth compared with the control (Fig. 1 C). The dominant-negative effect of the mutant was further confirmed in cell lines stably transfected with versicanΔEGF; three cell lines expressing the versicanΔEGF construct exhibited a dominant-negative effect on cell growth compared with the vector control (Fig.1 D). One of the cell lines was cultured and incubated with growth medium from the mini-versican- and vector-transfected COS-7 cells. Addition of exogenous growth medium from the mini-versican-transfected cells reversed this effect somewhat but not completely (Fig. 1 E). Having determined that the effect of versican on glioma cell growth is mediated, at least in part, by its G3 domain, we sought to further characterize the molecular determinant(s) of the effect. Specifically, we tested whether the EGF-like motifs in G3 might play a role. We tested our hypothesis by using a G3 domain from which the EGF-like motifs had been removed (G3ΔEGF). G3ΔEGF construct was expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2 A), and culture medium containing G3ΔEGF products was shown to have a weak inhibitory effect on cell growth (Fig. 2 B), whereas purified G3ΔEGF product produced a significant inhibitory effect on cell growth (Fig. 2 C). The effect of G3ΔEGF on cell proliferation was also obtained from colony formation assays. U87 cells transfected with G3ΔEGF and a control vector were treated with Geneticin (1.5 mg/ml), and the cultures were maintained in this medium until individual colonies were formed. G3ΔEGF transfection resulted in the formation of smaller colonies (Fig. 2 E) than did transfection with control vector (Fig. 2 D). The results obtained from cell proliferation assays were confirmed by analyzing cell cycle progression. Overexpression of G3ΔEGF caused arrest of a greater number of cells in G1 phase. A typical G3ΔEGF-transfected cell line and a vector-transfected cell line are shown in Fig. 3 A, in which 88% of G3ΔEGF-transfected cells were arrested in G1phase (7% in G2 phase and 4.7% in S phase). Only 65.5% of control vector-transfected cells were detected in G1phase (24.8% in G2 phase and 9.7% in S phase). The effects of G3ΔEGF expression on two cell cycle proteins are shown in Fig. 3 B. Cell lysate harvested from transfected cells was analyzed on Western blots probed with antibodies against cdk4 and cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz). Levels of cyclin D1 and cdk4 decreased dramatically in G3ΔEGF-transfected cell lines. The structure of nuclei was then examined, and it was observed that each nucleus of the vector-transfected cells contained one or two nucleoli (Fig.3 C), whereas each nucleus of the G3ΔEGF-transfected cells contained multiple nucleoli (Fig. 3 D). There are a number of mechanisms by which the versicanΔEGF and G3ΔEGF constructs could exert a dominant-negative effect on cell growth. The simplest explanation is that these mutant gene products are able to bind to sites on the glioma cell surface and thus successfully block the proliferative effects of endogenous versican. Because the G3ΔEGF construct was alone sufficient to exert this effect, we used it in these studies to minimize complications arising from potential cell surface binding sites present in other versican domains (e.g. G1). We first demonstrated that the full-length G3 products were able to bind to the cell surface. Glioma cells were incubated in growth media from G3- and vector-transfected COS-7 cells. After extensive washing, cell lysate was harvested and analyzed on Western blot. G3 bound to the glioma cell surface, resulting in detection of a G3 band in the cell lysate (Fig.4 A). Using the same methods, we demonstrated that G3 produced by bacteria and added exogenously to U87 cells was also able to bind to the cell surface (Fig.4 A). To test whether G3ΔEGF products were able to bind to glioma cells, U87 cells were incubated with growth media from COS-7 cells transfected with either G3ΔEGF or G3 construct, both of which were well expressed (Fig. 4 B). The cells were washed extensively and lysed for Western blot analysis. The G3 signal was significantly more intense than that of G3ΔEGF, indicating that G3 had a higher affinity for the glioma cell surface (Fig. 4 B). The media from G3- and G3ΔEGF-transfected cells were mixed with the cell lysate of bacteria expressing G3. The mixture was incubated with glioma cells, and the amount of His-tagged bacterial G3 product remaining on the cells was assessed. G3 and G3ΔEGF from COS-7 cells inhibited the binding of bacterial G3 product in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). The finding that deletion of the EGF-like motifs from the mini-versican and the G3 construct has a dominant-negative effect on cell growth suggests that, at high concentrations, the products of the versicanΔEGF and G3ΔEGF constructs were able to compete with endogenous versican for binding sites on glioma cells, although their binding is apparently weaker. We tested whether G3ΔEGF could compete with G3 to bind to glioma cell surface. G3 was mixed, at a fixed concentration, with varying amounts of G3ΔEGF, and the mixtures were incubated with glioma cells. High concentration of G3ΔEGF inhibited G3 binding to glioma cell surface (Fig. 4 D). To further characterize the mechanism of dominant-negative effect of G3ΔEGF on cell growth, we examined the expression of endogenous versican in cell lines stably transfected with the G3ΔEGF construct and the control vector. Interestingly, we observed that cells stably transfected with G3ΔEGF had a higher level of versican in their cytoplasm, as revealed by labeling with polyclonal anti-versican antibody (Fig. 5 A) as compared with cells transfected with the control vector (Fig. 5 B). This finding raised the possibility that the G3ΔEGF construct had no effect on the transcription and translation of endogenous versican, but in fact inhibited its post-translational processing. To test this, we analyzed culture media from cells stably transfected with G3ΔEGF or the vector on Western blot. Cells transfected with the vector did indeed secrete higher levels of versican into the growth medium as compared with the G3ΔEGF-transfected cells (Fig. 5 C). It was then necessary to examine whether expression of G3ΔEGF had any effect on transcriptional regulation of the endogenous versican gene. RT-PCR was performed using RNA from astrocytoma cell lines transfected with G3ΔEGF or the vector. Levels of RT-PCR products were similar in both cell lines, implying that G3ΔEGF had no effect on versican transcription (Fig. 5 D). To further confirm the effect of G3ΔEGF on proteoglycan secretion, we co-transfected COS-7 cells with a mini-versican construct and one of the following three constructs: G3ΔEGF construct, CD44, or a contro"

When added to resting splenocytes, TCR agonists initiated G0/G1 traverse and activated cyclin D3-cdk6 complexes in a serum-independent manner. On the other hand, both TCR agonists and 10% serum were required for the activation of cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 complexes and the entry of cells into S phase. Serum facilitated cdk2 activation by maximizing the extent and extending the duration of the TCR-initiated down-regulation of the cdk2 inhibitor, p27Kip1. Although p27Kip1 levels were reduced (albeit submaximally) in cells stimulated in serum-deficient medium, nearly all of the cdk2 complexes in these cells contained p27Kip1. In contrast, in cells receiving TCR agonist and 10% serum, little if any p27Kip1was present in cyclin-cdk2 complexes. Unlike wild-type splenocytes, p27Kip1-null splenocytes did not require serum for cdk2 activation or S phase entry whereas loss of the related cdk2 inhibitor, p21Cip1, did not override the serum dependence of these responses. We also found that cdk2 activation was both necessary and sufficient for maximal expression of cdk2 protein. These studies provide a mechanistic basis for the serum dependence of T cell mitogenesis.

T cell receptor interleukin-2 interleukin-2 receptor cyclin-dependent kinase CDK inhibitor phosphate-buffered saline glutathione S-transferase concanavalin A T cell proliferation, and the consequent expansion of T cell populations, are fundamental events in the generation of an immune response. In vivo, T cell mitogenesis is initiated by the interaction of T cell receptors (TCRs)1 with peptides coupled to major histocompatibility antigen complexes located on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (1Davis M.M. Bjorkman P.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). In vitro, the actions of natural ligands are mimicked by a variety of agents including anti-CD3, calcium ionophore, and lectins such as concanavalin A (ConA) and phytohemagglutinin. TCR stimulation allows resting T cells to enter G1 and induces the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the α subunit of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2Rα) (2Meuer S.C. Hussey R.E. Cantrell D.A.

In the presence of IL-2, IL-2Rα combines with IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ to form the high affinity IL-2R complex, which elicits the secondary signals required for continued G1 traverse and S phase entry. T cell proliferation also requires additional factors, many of which are routinely provided to cultured T cells in the form of serum (5Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous studies have shown that serum enhances the production of IL-2 and IL-2Rα (5Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar), the potential contribution of serum to other cell cycle-regulatory processes has yet to be explored. In T cells, as in other cell types, cell cycle traverse is governed by the ordered activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (6Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4976) Google Scholar). Activation of the CDKs requires their interaction with cyclins, whose levels fluctuate during the cell cycle, and their phosphorylation at specific threonine residues by constitutively expressed cyclin-activating kinases. CDKs also interact with a group of proteins collectively termed CDK inhibitors (CKIs). CKI levels, like cyclin levels, vary during the cell cycle and thus contribute to the periodicity of CDK activation (7Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar). Two classes of CKIs have been defined: the INK proteins, which target cdk4 and cdk6, and the Cip/Kip proteins, which inactivate cdk2-containing complexes (8Ruas M. Peters G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F115-F177Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 9Hengst L. Reed S.I. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 227: 25-41PubMed Google Scholar). Traverse of G0/G1 and entry into S phase is controlled by the sequential activation of complexes containing the D cyclins and cdk4 or cdk6, cyclin E and cdk2, and cyclin A and cdk2. Addition of mitogens to G0-arrested cultures induces the expression of the D cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) and, in some cell types (e.g. T cells), of cdk4 and cdk6 (10Winston J.T. Pledger W.J. Mol. Biol.

Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Pre-existing cyclin E-cdk2 complexes become active after p27Kip1 levels decrease and further phosphorylate Rb in late G1. When phosphorylated by these kinases, Rb no longer represses the activity of the E2F transcription factors, and a variety of genes, including those encoding cyclins E and A, are expressed (19Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar, 20DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell.

At this point, cells pass through the restriction point in late G1 and in a manner dependent on cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 activity enter and traverse S phase (22Planas-Silva M.D. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 768-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The drop in p27Kip1 levels and the consequent activation of pre-existing and newly formed cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 complexes are critical aspects of G0/G1 traverse. For example, prevention of p27Kip1 down-regulation by agents such as rapamycin and cyclic AMP blocks cdk2 activation and cell cycle traverse, as does ectopic expression of p27Kip1 (15Kato J.Y.

Conversely, ablation of p27Kip1 function in both whole animals and cultured cells has been shown to promote proliferation by impeding G0 arrest (26Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M.

The mitogen-induced decrease in p27Kip1 levels is a complex and not fully understood process that involves translational inhibition, accelerated degradation, and perhaps also transcriptional repression (12Kwon T.K.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Additional studies have shown that p27Kip1 down-regulation is not sufficient for cdk2 activation, which also requires sequestration of residual p27Kip1 molecules by complexes containing the D cyclins and their CDK partners (7Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5144) Google Scholar). Whether cyclin D/CDK activity is also repressed by p27Kip1 is unclear, because past reports differ in this regard (24LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 32Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J.

Previous studies have shown that TCR agonists down-regulate p27Kip1 and activate cdk6 and cdk2 when added to resting T cells (11Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kwon T.K. Buchholz M.A. Ponsalle P. Chrest F.J. Nordin A.A. J.

However, these studies were done on cells stimulated in the presence of 10% serum. Thus, they leave open the possibility that at least some of these responses are induced by TCR agonists in a serum-dependent manner. This is an important issue, because it addresses a potential mechanism by which serum might promote T cell proliferation. In the studies described here, we examined the contribution of serum to cyclin/CDK activation in primary splenocytes and purified T cells exposed to TCR agonists such as ConA or anti-CD3. We show that serum acts in conjunction with mitogenic amounts of ConA or anti-CD3 to induce the sustained down-regulation of p27Kip1 and the activation of cdk2-containing complexes. Consistent with the premise that serum facilitates T cell proliferation by targeting p27Kip1, we also find that splenocytes lacking p27Kip1 no longer require serum for cdk2 activation or S phase entry. A single cell suspension of mouse spleen cells was prepared by passage through nylon mesh. Red cells were depleted using a whole blood erythrocyte lysing kit (R&D Systems). For isolation of purified T cells, spleen cell suspensions were loaded onto T cell enrichment columns, and T cells were purified via high affinity negative selection as specified by the manufacturer (R&D Systems). Splenocytes and purified T cells were plated at 107 cells/ml and 5 × 106cells/ml, respectively, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For assessment of DNA synthesis, triplicate cultures in microtiter plates were pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for the indicated times. Incorporation was determined by scintillation counting, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. To determine cell cycle position, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 4 °C. Fixed cells were resuspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20, 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 1 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Total DNA content was analyzed on an EPICS 753 flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics, Inc.). Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm NaF, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate (lysis buffer). After a 30-min incubation, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Proteins (30 μg) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for cdk2. Blots were blocked in PBST (PBS plus 0.05% Tween) containing 5% instant milk and incubated with primary antibody in PBST. Proteins recognized by the antibody were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody as specified by the manufacturer (Pierce). Cell extracts (80 μg of protein in lysis buffer) were incubated with antibody to the indicated cyclin or CDK for 4–12 h at 4 °C and subsequently with protein A-agarose beads. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with either histone kinase buffer (50 mmTris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) or Rb kinase buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Washed complexes were incubated in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 0.1 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and either 100 μg/ml histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min at 37 °C or 2.5 μg/ml GST-Rb for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by boiling in Laemmli buffer and proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For p27Kip1 immunodepletion, cell extracts (150 μg of protein) were incubated with antibody to p27Kip1 (or for mock depletion, with preimmune serum) for 4 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were removed by centrifugation with protein A-agarose beads. Removal of p27Kip1 was confirmed by Western blotting. ConA and anti-CD3 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. and PharMingen, respectively. Antibodies to cyclin D3, cyclin E, and cdk6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p27Kip1 and cdk2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Cyclin A antibody was provided by E. Leof and GST-Rb by D. Cress. p27kip-deficient mice were obtained from by A. Koff (34Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A. Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), and p21Cip1-deficient mice were obtained from T. Jacks (35Brugarolas J. Chandrasekaran C. Gordon J.I. Beach D. Jacks T. Hannon G.J. Nature. 1995; 377: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Initial experiments confirmed that TCR agonists and serum act in a concerted manner to stimulate the proliferation of primary splenocytes and purified T cells. The cells used in these experiments were derived from Balb/c mice. As assessed by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA, resting splenocyte populations did not initiate DNA synthesis when treated for 40 h with serum (0.1–10%) alone or with 0.1% serum and various concentrations of ConA (Fig. 1 A) or anti-CD3 (Fig. 1 B). However, co-stimulation of splenocytes with optimal amounts of serum (10%) and either ConA (2.5 μg/ml) or anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) produced a significant increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation. Anti-CD3 and serum also synergistically stimulated the cell cycle traverse of T cell-enriched populations containing greater than 95% T cells (Fig. 1 C). Maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation occurred in T cell cultures receiving 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 and 10% serum. The lower amount of [3H]thymidine incorporation seen in cultures receiving 10 μg/ml as compared with 5 μg/ml anti-CD3 presumably reflects the fact that many of the cells in the former condition have already exited S phase at the time of the pulse (36Williams M.E. Lichtman A.H. Abbas A.K. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1208-1214PubMed Google Scholar). Serum did not simply substitute for IL-2, because ConA (2.5 μg/ml) and IL-2 (500 units/ml) did not induce DNA synthesis in medium containing 0.1% serum (data not shown). When exposed to 10% serum and either ConA or anti-CD3, quiescent splenocytes and T cells entered S phase after a lag of 20–24 h (Fig. 1, D, E, andF). As determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, 30–40% of the cells were in S phase or G2/M at 40 h after stimulation. In contrast, cultures stimulated in medium containing 0.1% serum did not appreciably initiate DNA synthesis during the experimental period. These findings show that mixed splenocyte populations respond similarly to ConA and anti-CD3 and behave similarly to purified T cells. The next set of experiments addressed the possibility that serum promoted T cell proliferation by facilitating cyclin/CDK activation. In these experiments, quiescent splenocytes and T cells were stimulated with ConA or anti-CD3 in the presence of 10% or 0.1% serum. These serum concentrations were chosen because they allow maximal and minimal S phase entry, respectively (see Fig. 1). Serum at 0.1% (rather than no serum) was used as the negative control, because serum at this concentration prevents adsorption of IL-2 to culture dishes (5Herzberg V.L. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 998-1004PubMed Google Scholar). However, events induced by ConA or anti-CD3 in medium containing 0.1% serum were also induced by these agents in serum-free medium (data not shown) and thus are considered serum-independent. Cyclin, CDK, and p27Kip1 levels were determined by Western blotting, and cyclin/CDK activity was assessed byin vitro kinase assay. It is noted that treatment of resting cells with 10% serum in the absence of TCR agonist had no effect on the responses examined below (data not shown). p27Kip1 was present in quiescent splenocytes, and its levels decreased to a similar extent in cells stimulated with ConA and either 10% or 0.1% serum for 10 h (Fig.2 A; 68% versus51% decrease, respectively). After this time, p27Kip1levels fell much more precipitously in cultures receiving ConA and 10% as compared with 0.1% serum. For example, at 25 h after stimulation, p27Kip1 levels were 10-fold lower in the serum-supplemented culture than in the serum-deficient culture. Although the kinetics differed somewhat, the pattern of p27Kip1 down-regulation was similar in ConA-treated splenocytes (Fig. 2 B), anti-CD3-treated splenocytes (Fig.2 C), and anti-CD3-treated T cells (Fig. 2 D). Note that p27Kip1 levels re-accumulated at later times in cells stimulated in serum-deficient medium (Fig. 2, A–D). These findings show that p27Kip1 down-regulation in T cells is a two-stage process, consisting of serum-independent and serum-dependent segments. Cyclin D3, cdk6, and cyclin E were expressed at low levels in resting cells and were substantially up-regulated by ConA or anti-CD3 regardless of serum concentration (Fig. 2, B–D). These agents also increased cyclin D3-cdk6 activity in cells receiving either 10% or 0.1% serum. Cyclin A, on the other hand, was barely detectable in quiescent cells and was up-regulated by ConA or anti-CD3 to a greater extent in medium containing 10% as compared with 0.1% serum (Fig. 2, B–D). cdk2 expression was even more dependent on serum; elevations in the basal levels of cdk2 were seen in cells treated with ConA and 10% but not 0.1% serum (see Fig.3 B). In cells stimulated in medium containing 10% serum, increases in the expression of cyclin E, cyclin A, and cdk2 were paralleled by increases in the activities of both cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2. In contrast, these complexes were not active in cells receiving ConA or anti-CD3 in serum-deficient medium (Fig. 2, B–D). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TCR agonists induce an initial but transient loss of p27Kip1, the expression of cyclin D3, cyclin E, and cdk6, and the activation of cyclin D3-cdk6 complexes in a serum-independent manner. In contrast, serum is clearly required for maximal and sustained p27Kip1 down-regulation, maximal expression of cyclin A and cdk2, and activation of cyclin E-cdk2 and cyclin A-cdk2 complexes. Because cdk2 activity is obligatory for cell cycle traverse, it is apparent from these studies that serum promotes T cell proliferation by enabling this response. The data presented above demonstrate that serum is required for events that occur in late G0/G1 (e.g. cdk2 activation) but not for events that begin earlier in G0/G1(e.g. cdk6 activation). Consistent with these results, we found that quiescent splenocytes initiated but did not complete G0/G1 traverse in serum-deficient medium. In these experiments, resting splenocytes were treated continuously with ConA and either 10% or 0.1% serum, or were pretreated with ConA and 0.1% serum for 20 h prior to addition of 10% serum. DNA synthesis was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Similar to the data in Fig. 1 D, splenocytes co-treated with ConA and 10% serum entered S phase after an approximate 20 h lag (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, cultures receiving ConA and 0.1% serum remained (for the most part) in G0/G1. However, when exposed to 10% serum, serum-deprived cultures initiated DNA synthesis within 8–12 h. This observation indicates that ConA-treated splenocytes partially traverse G0/G1 in medium containing 0.1% serum and that the serum-dependent “checkpoint” is temporally located in mid to late G1. In accord with its capacity to induce S phase entry, serum replenishment also elevated the expression of cyclin A and cdk2, maximized the loss of p27Kip1, and restored both cyclin A-cdk2 and cyclin E-cdk2 activities (Fig. 3 B). The capacity of splenocytes pretreated with ConA and 0.1% serum to elicit these responses when exposed to 10% serum indicates that a substantial portion of the population remains viable in serum-deficient medium. Our data suggest that serum elicits cdk2 activation by persistently down-regulating p27Kip1 and by elevating the expression of cdk2 and cyclin A. Such conditions would favor the formation of cyclin-cdk2 complexes that do not contain p27Kip1 (designated “p27Kip1-free”) and thus are catalytically active. On the other hand, due to higher p27Kip1 levels and lower cdk2 and cyclin A levels, inactive p27Kip1-associated complexes would predominate in cells receiving ConA and 0.1% serum. These predictions are confirmed by the data presented in Fig.4. In these experiments, the amounts of total and p27Kip1-free cyclin A-cdk2 complexes were determined in unfractionated and p27Kip1-immunodepleted cell lysates, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, most if not all of the cyclin A-cdk2 complexes in cells stimulated with ConA and 10% serum for 24 or 40 h were present in p27Kip1-depleted extracts and thus are not bound to p27Kip1 (comparelanes 3 and 9, and 6 and12). Cyclin A-cdk2 complexes were not detected in cells receiving ConA and 0.1% serum for 24 h (lane 1) but were present at low levels in cells treated in this manner for 40 h (lane 4). However, the majority of these complexes were associated with p27Kip1 (i.e. were removed by p27Kip1 antibody; compare lanes 4 and10). Addition of serum (to 10%) to cells treated with ConA and 0.1% serum for 20 h increased both the total amount of cyclin A-cdk2 and the percentage of cyclin A-cdk2 complexes that do not contain p27Kip1 (lanes 5 and 11). Similar results were obtained in experiments examining the interaction of p27Kip1 with cyclin E-cdk2 complexes (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the lack of cdk2 activity in splenocytes stimulated in serum-deficient medium results from the presence of p27Kip1 in cdk2-containing complexes. Previous studies have shown that T cells derived from p27Kip1-null mice exhibit constitutive cyclin E-cdk2 activity (37Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E. Polyak K. Tsai L.H.

Because our data indicate that serum promotes T cell proliferation by allowing cdk2 activation, it was of interest to determine if splenocytes lacking p27Kip1 initiated DNA synthesis in a serum-independent manner. For these experiments, we used splenic cells derived from C57b1/6 mice that express an N-terminally truncated form of p27Kip1 that does not interact with or inhibit the activity of cyclin-cdk2 complexes (34Kiyokawa H. Kineman R.D. Manova-Todorova K.O. Soares V.C. Hoffman E.S. Ono M. Khanam D. Hayday A.C. Frohman L.A. Koff A. Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Initial experiments characterized the “cyclin/CDK profiles” of p27+/+, p27+/−, and p27−/− splenocytes. In all three populations, and similar to results obtained with Balb/c splenocytes (Fig.2 B), levels of cyclin D3 and cdk6 and of cyclin D3-cdk6 activity increased in response to ConA in a serum-independent manner (data not shown). In unstimulated p27−/− cells, levels of cdk2 and of cyclin E-cdk2 activity were comparable to those of p27+/+ cells treated with ConA and 10% serum (Fig.5 A; compare lanes 3and 8). Thus, in the absence of p27Kip1, cdk2 is constitutively expressed and, as described previously, cyclin E-cdk2 is constitutively active (37Fero M.L. Rivkin M. Tasch M. Porter P. Carow C.E. Firpo E.

Lacy S. Chung G. Randel E. Firpo E. Roberts J.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 163-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In contrast, levels of cyclin A and of cyclin A-cdk2 activity were not substantially elevated in unstimulated p27−/− cells. However, addition of ConA and 0.1% serum to p27−/− cells resulted in increases in both cyclin A expression and associated activity that were comparable to those seen in p27+/+ cells receiving ConA and 10% (but not 0.1%) serum (compare lanes 3 and 11). Thus, although TCR stimulation is still required, abrogation of p27Kip1function renders cyclin A expression and cyclin A-cdk2 activation serum-independent. The need for TCR signaling for these events presumably reflects the dependence of cyclin A expression (and hence cyclin A-cdk2 activity) on cyclin D3-cdk6 activity and consequent Rb phosphorylation and E2F activation (18Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 20DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). p27+/− cells behaved similarly to p27−/−cells in terms of cyclin A expression and cyclin A-cdk2 activity (Fig.5 A, lanes 4–7). On the other hand, p27+/− cells, unlike p27−/− cells, required ConA (but not 10% serum) for cdk2 up-regulation and cyclin E-cdk2 activation. p27Kip1, however, was present in quiescent p27+/− cells at levels comparable to those seen in quiescent p27+/+ cells (compare lanes 1 and4), and its down-regulation was mediated by ConA (lanes 5–7). Interestingly, ConA and 0.1% serum decreased p27Kip1 levels in p27+/− cells to an extent greater than that observed in p27+/+ cells stimulated with ConA and 10% serum (compare lanes 3 and 7). Together, the findings"

The structure of PSII has been very recently determined to 3.8 Å resolution (1Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). The primary electron acceptor in PSII is a pheophytin-a molecule. There are two symmetry-related pheophytins in PSII that differ with respect to the presence or absence of a hydrogen bonding interaction between the pheophytin ring V (Fig. 1 for ring designation) carbonyl group and the protein. Significantly, only the pheophytin (active branch) that is hydrogen-bonded to glutamic acid 130 of polypeptide D1 (D1-E130 residue) via the ring V carbonyl group is reduced following charge separation (2Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A.P. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis coupled with spectroscopic techniques have proven to be extremely useful tools to characterize pigment-protein interactions. The resolution of the x-ray structure is currently insufficient to accurately determine such interactions. In this paper, we report on HF-EPR measurements of the Pheo⨪ radical in spinach as well as wild type and site-specific mutants of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which can be used to more precisely characterize such interactions between radicals and neighboring protein residues. The pheophytins in photosynthetic reaction centers have been studied using a variety of methods. Comparative measurements of the carbonyl vibrational frequencies of the bacterial and plant reaction centers using resonance Raman (3Moënne-Loccoz P. Robert B. Lutz M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3641-3645Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and differential Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (4Nabedryk E. Andrianambinintsoa S. Berger G. Leonhard M. Mäntele W. Breton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 49-54Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggested that the ring V carbonyl group was likely to be hydrogen bonded in PSII. Such a hydrogen bond was also inferred from electron nuclear double resonance studies by using deuterium exchange experiments and in vitro pheophytin models (5Lubitz W. Isaacson R.A. Okamura M.Y. Abresch E.C. Plato M. Feher G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 977: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Modeling studies based on the sequence homology between the PSII D1 and D2 subunits and the bacterial reaction center L and M subunits have been carried out on C. reinhardtii, as well as on spinach, pea and Synechocystis (6Xiong J. Subramanian S. Govindjee Photosynth. Res. 1998; 56: 229-254Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 7Svensson B. Vass I. Cedergren E. Styring S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2051-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies onSynechocystis have also been carried out at the predicted pheophytin hydrogen bonding site (2Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A.P. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These modeling and mutagenesis studies supported the conclusion of the earlier spectroscopic studies that the pheophytin ring V carbonyl group in all PSII complexes is hydrogen-bonded. The likely hydrogen bond donor was identified as the amino acid residue 130 of the D1 subunit, which is homologous to glutamic acid 104 of the L subunit (L-E104) of the bacterial reaction center from Rhodopseudomonas viridis. This residue is a glutamine in the case of cyanobacterial PSII and a glutamic acid in the chloroplastic PSII complex. g values of organic radicals have been shown to be very sensitive probes of the molecular structure and local environment of the radicals (8Knüpling M. Törring J.T. Un S. Chem. Phys. 1997; 219: 291-304Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Un S. Atta M. Fontecave M. Rutherford A.W. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 1993; 97: 7639-7647Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These g values are difficult to resolve using conventional 0.3 T/9 GHz EPR. However, by using much higher fields and frequencies, they can be measured more readily. Recently, we have reported the HF-EPR spectrum of the Pheo⨪ radical from wild type spinach PSII as well as of the Bpheo⨪ analog from R. viridis(11Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Un S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7826-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We proposed that the differences between the g tensors of the two radicals reflect differences in intrinsic electronic structure and/or differences in local protein environment. In addition, the results of measurements performed on oriented samples allowed us to fix the three principle directions of the g tensor to the molecular frame. The gx direction was concluded to be along the ring V carbonyl bond, whereas the gz direction is perpendicular to the ring plane. The g tensor orientation is therefore similar to those of the tyrosyl (12Fasanella E.L. Gordy W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and semiquinone (10Burghaus O. Plato M. Rohrer M. Möbius K. MacMillan F. Lubitz W. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 7639-7647Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) radicals. In both cases, by using HF-EPR and theoretical calculations, it has been shown that the gx value is sensitive to the presence of hydrogen bonds (8Knüpling M. Törring J.T. Un S. Chem. Phys. 1997; 219: 291-304Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Un S. Atta M. Fontecave M. Rutherford A.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10713-10719Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and charged amino acid residues (13Un S. Gerez C. Elleingand E. Fontecave M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3048-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This sensitivity is a direct consequence of the fact that both radicals possess C–O functional groups that carry a significant amount of unpaired spin density. Similarly, computational results (14O'Malley P.J. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 2176-2182Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar) have shown that the Pheo⨪ radical also carries appreciable spin density on the ring V carbonyl group. These observations suggest that the gx value should be sensitive to local electrostatic environment around the Pheo⨪ ring V carbonyl group. In this paper, we have used the mutants of C. reinhardtii in conjunction with HF-EPR to demonstrate the sensitivity of the gx value of pheophytin radicals to the electrostatic environment and to directly confirm the presence of a hydrogen bond to the ring V carbonyl group. The isolation of the C. reinhardtii wild type and mutants was done as described in Ling et al. 2X. Ling, M. Seibert, M. Wasielewski, and R. T. Sayre, manuscript in preparation.. The generation of the Pheo⨪ radical in spinach PSII as well as the Bpheo⨪ radical in R. viridis has been described elsewhere (11Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Un S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7826-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The procedure to generate the Pheo⨪ radical inC. reinhardtii wild type and mutants was similar except that the reduced samples were illuminated at 0 °C for 5 min. The HF-EPR spectrometer as well as the procedure for simulating the spectra have been described in reference (11Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Un S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7826-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The use of a Mn(II) g standard (g = 2.00101) (10Burghaus O. Plato M. Rohrer M. Möbius K. MacMillan F. Lubitz W. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 7639-7647Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) was required for calibration and to accurately measure g values. In this way, the g values of different samples could be compared with within 2 × 10−5. Fig. 2 shows the HF-EPR spectra recorded for the Bpheo⨪ radical from R. viridis and the Pheo⨪ radical from spinach and C. reinhardtiiPSII particles (wild type and D1-E130H, D1-E130Q, and D1-E130L mutants). To accurately obtain the g values of the radical in each case, all six spectra were adequately simulated using a single g tensor and a line-broadening tensor, the principal axes of which were collinear with the g tensor. The latter tensor was needed to account for the observed anisotropic broadening that was presumably due to unresolved hyperfine couplings. Hyperfine interactions were not explicitly considered in the calculations. The simulation parameters are given in Table I. The spinach and wild type Pheo⨪ g values were identical to within 4 × 10−5. The radical in spinach was slightly better resolved. When comparing the g values measured for the C. reinhardtiiwild type and mutants, the relationship between hydrogen bonding and g values is clearly seen on the gx edge of the spectra. Like tyrosyl and semiquinone radicals, the gx value decreases with increasing hydrogen bonding. Replacement of the hydrogen bond donor by a leucine (D1-E130L) induces a shift of 20 × 10−5 in the gx value. A change of 3 × 10−5 in the gx values reported in Table I resulted in an increase of the root mean square difference between the experimental spectra and simulations of at least 10%. Hence, the differences in the reported gxvalues between the D1-E130H and D1-E130Q mutants and wild type were significant and indicated that the electrostatic influence of the leucine, histidine, glutamine, and glutamic acid side chains were not identical.Table Ig values of Pheo⨪ and Bpheo⨪ from simulation of experimental data and ADF-ZORA calculationsgxgygzΔHxΔHyΔHzmTmTmTPSII Pheo⨪Spinach 1-aFrom Ref. 11.2.004242.003162.002372.12.02.1C. reinhardtiiE1302.004202.003202.002362.92.22.8E130H2.004292.003192.002422.42.22.9E130Q2.004312.003162.002402.72.62.6E130L2.004402.003212.002433.02.32.9ZORANo charge2.004632.003252.002041.8 Å charge>2.004252.003442.00206Bacterial Bpheo⨪R. viridis1-aFrom Ref. 11.2.004372.003402.002392.02.12.2ZORANo charge2.004872.003352.002352.0 Å charge2.004532.003392.002281-a From Ref. 11Dorlet P.

Open table in a new tab To study the effect of the electrostatic environment on the Pheo⨪ g tensor, g value calculations on prototypic Pheo⨪ and Bpheo⨪ were carried out using the relativistic zeroth order regular approximation (ZORA) method as implemented in the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) program package (16van Lenthe E.

The calculations utilized single zeta wavefunctions for hydrogens and carbons and double zeta wavefunctions for nitrogens and oxygens. For carbons, nitrogens, and oxygens, frozen core wavefunctions were used. The calculations were spin-restricted. The molecule used in the calculations was derived from the bacteriopheophytin structure (taken from the Protein Data Bank, accession number 1PRC). The structure was modified to a pheophytin, and standard protons were added. The structure of the entire Pheo⨪ molecule was not used for the calculations for efficiency reasons. All side groups that were not conjugated with the ring conjugation system were replaced by hydrogens. The resulting molecule was geometry-optimized using the PM3 method as implemented in Gaussian 94 (22). Similar methodology has been used in previous density functional theory studies (14O'Malley P.J. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 2176-2182Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The geometry-optimized structure was planar. g values using a saddle-shaped structure of the non-optimized structure did not yield significant differences. The geometry-optimized structure was used in all calculations including those involving external point charges. The structure was not reoptimized in the presence of the point charge as neither ADF nor Gaussian 94 packages permitted this. To simulate electrostatic effects, a positive point charge located 120° relative to the ring V carbonyl bond at varying distances (Fig. 1), was incorporated into the calculations. The results of the ZORA calculations are summarized in Table I along with the experimental measurements. The variations of the calculated gx values for the pheophytin and bacteriopheophytin model molecules as a function of the oxygen-point charge distance are plotted in Fig.3. The HF-EPR spectroscopy of the Pheo⨪ radical in wild type and mutants of C. reinhardtii confirms the sensitivity of g values to the protein microenvironment for this type of radical as was predicted earlier (11Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Un S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7826-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The shift observed in the gx value between the wild type and D1-E130L mutant is caused by a red shift of the n → π* electronic excitation upon the loss of the hydrogen bond on the ring V carbonyl group. This can be compared with a hydrogen bond-induced gxshift of 200 × 10−5 for tyrosyl radicals (9Un S. Atta M. Fontecave M. Rutherford A.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10713-10719Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that carry ∼25% of spin density on the phenolic oxygen. This result provides strong experimental evidence for the presence of non-negligible ring V oxygen spin density (14O'Malley P.J. J. Phys. Chem. 2000; 104: 2176-2182Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The removal of the hydrogen bond interaction is supported by a blue shift of 2.5 nm in the Pheo⨪ Qx (π → π*) band observed in C. reinhardtii as well as in the corresponding mutant inSynechocystis relative to the wild type. The opposite shifts of the two types of electronic excitations are entirely consistent with generally accepted interpretation of hydrogen bonding effects on electronic absorption spectra (23Pimentel G.C. McCellan A.L. The Hydrogen Bond. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1960: 157-166Google Scholar). When the D1-Q130 residue in wild type Synechocystis is mutated to a glutamic acid, the Pheo⨪ Qx (π → π*) band red shifts to the same wavelength as that of plant (Pisum sativum) indicating a strengthening of the hydrogen bond (2Giorgi L.B. Nixon P.J. Merry S.A.P. Joseph D.M. Durrant J.R. De Las Rivas J. Barber J. Porter G. Klug D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2093-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The HF-EPR results are entirely consistent with these optical results. The C. reinhardtiiD1-E130Q mutant exhibits a gx shift of +10 × 10−5 indicating a weakening of the hydrogen bond when the glutamic acid is replaced by a glutamine. These shifts in electronic states point to the possibility that the redox potential of the pheophytin is also modified by the hydrogen bond. In the context of hydrogen bonding, the similarity in g values between D1-E130H and D1-E130Q mutants and the wild type is not surprising. All three amino acids are capable of hydrogen bonding. In fact, the g values of the D1-E130H and D1-E130Q mutants and wild type differ only slightly. The ordering roughly follows that of increasing electronegativity: glutamic acid, histidine, glutamine, leucine. Because the dipole moment of an OH group is higher than that of an NH group one would expect that, for a given geometry, a histidine and a glutamine are likely to be weaker hydrogen bond donors than a glutamic acid. Without crystallographic data, we cannot rigorously exclude the possibility that the mutations have caused electrostatic changes in the pheophytin environment other than those intended. However, the observed trends in gx values are clearly consistent with the expected effects of hydrogen bonding and are very similar to those observed for tyrosyl and semiquinone radicals. To quantitatively analyze the magnitude of the hydrogen bonding effect, we carried outab initio quantum mechanics calculation of the g values. The Bpheo⨪ ZORA g values were in good agreement with experiment. By contrast, the Pheo⨪ ZORA g values only modestly agreed. For both Pheo⨪ and Bpheo⨪, the calculated gx direction was within 10° of the carbonyl bond with the exact value depending on the charge-oxygen distance, and the gz direction was always perpendicular to the ring plane. This was independent of the dihedral angle of the side groups relative to ring plane. The near collinearity of the gx direction with the carbonyl bond is consistent with theoretical predictions (24Stone A.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A. 1963; 271: 424-434Crossref Google Scholar, 25Stone A.J. Mol. Phys. 1963; 6: 509-515Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Stone A.J. Mol. Phys. 1964; 7: 311-316Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and our previous assignment based on HF-EPR measurements performed on oriented samples (11Dorlet P. Rutherford A.W. Un S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7826-7834Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The best agreement between the Bpheo⨪ experimental data was found when the point charge was 2.0 Å away from the bacteriopheophytin oxygen atom. In the R. viridiscrystallographic structure, the L-E104 carboxylic acid oxygen is 2.7 Å away with the proton presumably about 1 Å closer. Similar to tyrosyl and semiquinone radicals (15Un S. Tang X.S. Diner B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the pheophytin gxvalues followed an r−2 dependence on the charge-oxygen distance (Fig. 3). For both radicals, the ZORA calculations predicted that a positive charge at 1.8 Å will contribute a shift of as much as 40 × 10−5 in the gx value. The difference between wild type and D1-E130L mutant was 20 × 10−5. Some of the differences between experiment and theory are likely due to the fact that a full positive charge has a much stronger effect than a hydrogen bond. Further computational studies are needed to better understand the discrepancies between the calculated and experimental g values. Nonetheless, the observed increase in the gx-values due to the weakening of the hydrogen bond in the mutants is predicted by the ZORA calculations. The experimental and theoretical results reported in this paper suggest that the differences in g values between Bpheo⨪ inR. viridis and Pheo⨪ in spinach are largely due to structural differences. The specific gx values reflect hydrogen bonding to the ring V carbonyl group. These results taken together with previous work on tyrosyl, semiquinones, chlorophyll, and carotenoid radicals demonstrate the usefulness of HF-EPR in probing the structure of and protein environment around radicals.

The molecular mechanism(s) involved in esophagogastric MAPK activation have not previously been investigated. Constitutive activation of both ERK1 and -2 isoforms was evident in each of the five RBM cell lines. Elk-1, a transcription factor activated by the ERK1/2 pathway was also found to be constitutively activated. Cell lines generated from metastases of involved lymph nodes (OC2) and ascites (OC1) of patients with esophageal cancer do not display, however, hyperphosphorylation of ERK1/2. Constitutive RBM ERK1/2 activation is protein kinase C and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase dependent. Surprisingly, constitutive ERK1/2 activation is MEK-independent. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK with two specific inhibitors, PD 98059 and U0126, were both ineffective in blocking ERK activation. Similarly, the use of a dominant negative MEK mutant was without effect. Interestingly, experiments overexpressing two different dominant negative Pak1 mutants significantly reduced RBM ERK1/2 activation, albeit not to the same extent for all cell lines. We also examined the role of three different phosphatases, PAC1, MKP-1, and -2. While RBM ERK1/2 activation was found to be PAC1- and MKP-2-independent, surprisingly, MKP-1 was down-regulated in all five RBM cell lines. In conclusion, we provide evidence for the first time for a MEK-independent constitutive ERK1/2 activation pathway in esophagogastric RBM cell lines.

Approximately half of patients diagnosed with localized esophageal cancer die of metastatic disease within the first 2 years following tumor resection. We have succeeded in developing a number of esophagogastric cell lines from the rib bone marrow of patients (3O'Sullivan G.C. Collins J.K. O'Brien F. Crowley B. Murphy K. Lee G. Shanahan F. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1535-1540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that these cells are viable, proliferate, and grow independently in tissue culture and form malignant tumors in athymic nude mice (4O'Sullivan G.C. Sheehan D. Clarke A.

These metastatic cells are representative of the disseminated progenitors of secondary tumors and are the appropriate targets for treatment. The precise molecular events leading to the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype remain largely unknown. Members of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins have been implicated in tumor progression and are found to be activated in 20 to 30% of tumors (5Lowry D.R. Willumsen B.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In its active GTP-bound state, Ras activates the serine threonine kinase Raf (6Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Raf upon activation in turn phosphorylates the dual specific kinase MEK1 (also known as MAP kinase kinase or MAPKK) which in turn phosphorylates the MAP kinases ERK1 and -2 (for extracellular regulated kinases 1 and 2). Although MEK is the only known kinase directly downstream of Raf, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that Raf can also activate other effectors (7Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouyssegur J. J.

The Pak kinases Pak1, -2 and -3, are a family of protein kinases that are regulated by GTP-bound Rac and Cdc42 and are candidates for effectors that mediate both actin and JNK signaling (for review, see Ref. 11Manser E. Lim L. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The MAPKs are activated by the reversible dual threonine and tyosine phosphorylation of a conserved T-X-Y motif (12Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). The reversible nature of MAPK phosphorylation suggests that phosphatases play a key role in regulating MAPK activity (for review, see Ref. 13Guan K.-L. Dixon J.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MAPK phosphatase-1 and -2 (MKP-1, -2) as well as PAC1, a phosphatase which shares a highly homologous C-terminal catalytic domain with MKP-1 (14Rohan P.J. Davis P. Moskaluk C.A. Kearns M. Krutzsch H.

While PAC1 is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, MKP-1 and -2 are more widely expressed and are induced by growth factors and genotoxic and environmental stresses (17Liu Y. Gorospe M.

In this study, we undertook to characterize the MAPK signaling pathway in micrometastatic cell lines generated from rib bone marrow of patients undergoing resection of esophagogastric malignancies, which until now had remained unexplored. Using complementary genetic and pharmacological approaches, we now demonstrate that in all five esophagogastric rib bone marrow (RBM) cell lines examined, both ERK1 and -2 isoforms are activated in a MEK- and Raf-1-independent manner. In contrast, however, ERK1/2 activation was found to be PKC-, PI3K- and Pak1-dependent. Moreover, we did not detect PAC1 expression, but found that MKP-1 but not MKP-2 was down-regulated. In addition, the activation of ERK1/2 correlated with increased activation of the downstream transcription factor Elk-1.

Briefly, RBM1 and -5 cell lines are cells cultured from two different patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction. RBM2 and -4 cell lines are cells cultured from two different patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and finally, the RBM3 cell line are cells cultured from a patient with squamous carcinoma of the esophagus. OC1 and OC2 are squamous cell lines established from malignant ascites and a lymph node, respectively, of two patients with esophageal cancer. Finally, OC3 are adenocarcinoma cells established from a metastatic lymph node of a Barrett's esophageal lesion. We used normal human bone marrow stromal (HBMS) cells throughout this study as control. CACO-2, HT-29, and SW480 cells were also employed for comparative purposes in some experiments throughout this study. RBM(1–5), OC1, -2, and -3, CACO-2, HT-29, and SW480 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were washed twice with DMEM, and 1 × 105 cells/well were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates. After 48 h cells were cultured in medium supplemented with antibiotics and 0.5% FCS for all experiments performed unless otherwise stated. HBMS cells, obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD), were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate as previously described (23Roecklein B.A. Torok-Storb B.

The dominant-negative form of MEK1 was a generous gift of Drs. O. A. Coso and J. S. Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). RBM(1–5) cell lines, OC1, -2, and -3, CACO-2, HT-29, SW480, and HBMS cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and 0.5% FCS. Cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer as previously described (27Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Pratico D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol.

Supernatants were used for immunoblotting with specific antibodies for the phosphorylated or total p42/p44 MAPK, JNK1/2, or p38, using the experimental conditions described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Similarly, membranes were incubated with antibodies for Raf-1 (C-12), and MKP-1 (M-18) and -2 (S-18) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Chemiluminescent substrates were used to reveal positive bands that were visualized after exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All immunoblots were performed in triplicate. ERK, MEK, and Raf kinase assays were performed as previously described (28Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Brown K. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol.

Supernatants were incubated with mild agitation for 60 min at 4 °C with 5 μg of anti-ERK-1(C-16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-MEK-1 (Transduction Laboratories), or anti-Raf-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies preabsorbed to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 2 mm Na3VO4, once with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m LiCl, and once with MAP kinase reaction buffer (12.5 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm NaF, and 0.5 mm vanadate) and resuspended in 30 μl of reaction buffer (kinase reaction buffer with 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 3.3 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 μg of myelin basic protein, 0.3 μg of kinase inactive GST-ERK1(K71A) (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) or 0.1 μg of kinase-inactive GST-MEK-1(K97A) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were run on a 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and visualized by autoradiography. The MAPK, MAPKK, and Raf-1 activity was defined as the amount of radioactivity incorporated into myelin basic protein, GST-ERK1, or GST-MEK-1, respectively, under these conditions. Alternatively, the reaction was terminated by spotting 30 μl of reaction mixture onto 1-inch squares of phosphocellulose paper (P81; Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, United Kingdom). Free γ-32P was removed by three washes in 180 mmphosphoric acid as previously described (26Tang Y. Marwaha S. Rutkowski J.L. Tennekoon G.I. Phillips P.C. Field J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Total RNA from RBM(1–5), OC1, -2, and -3, CACO-2, HT-29, SW480, and HBMS cells was isolated using the acid guanidium:phenol:chloroform method (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I (RQ1; Promega, Madison, WI) and subsequently re-extracted by the acid guanidium:phenol:chloroform method. PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2 μl of cDNA, 15 pmol of each primer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase, all in 1 × supplied Taq buffer (Promega). Sequences of primers used were: β-actin (primer positions correspond to nucleotides 541–571 (sense primer) and nucleotides 1171–1201 (antisense primer) on human β-actin mRNA, sense: 5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′; β-actin, antisense: 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′; PAC-1 (20Kim S.C.

The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C, 15 s; 64 °C, 20 s; 72 °C, 1 min, following an 80 °C, 3-min step prior to the addition of Taq (hot start), with 23 cycles for β-actin and 33 cycles for PAC-1. 10 μl of each PCR was resolved on ethidium bromide-stained 3:1 NuSieve:Agarose gels. To investigate constitutive Elk-1 transcriptional activation, we employed the PathDetect trans-reporting system as previously described but with minor modifications (27Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Pratico D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7545-7556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into RBM(1–5), OC1, -2, and -3 using LipofectAMINETM 2000 Reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For all experiments, 1 μg of Renilla luciferase vector pRL-SV40 (Promega Corp.) was included which provides constitutive luciferase expression in transfected cells and serves as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency. Cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter (pFR-Luc) and Renilla plasmids, along with the GAL-4-c-Elk-1 expression plasmid or pFC-dbd plasmid as a negative control. Transfections were carried out using a total of 5 μg of DNA (3 μg of GAL-4-c-Elk-1 plus 1 μg of pFR-Luc plus 1 μg of Renilla or 3 μg of pFC-dbd plus 1 μg of pFR-Luc plus 1 μg of Renilla). Forty-eight hours following transfection, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and refed with DMEM supplemented with antibiotics and 0.5% FCS for a further 48 h. Both firefly- and Renilla-luciferase activities were measured using a commercial Dual LuicferaseTM Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. To establish stable cell lines expressing Pak1, Pak1R299, Pak1L83,L86,R299, Pak1L83,L86, and DN MEK, each construct was co-transfected with pCDNA3 into RBM(1–5) cell lines, OC1, -2, and -3. Transfections were carried out using LipofectAMINETM 2000 Reagent and a total of 10 μg of DNA (5 μg of each test plasmid plus 5 μg of pCDNA3) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following 48–72 h after the addition of DNA, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and split 1:3 into 100-mm diameter dishes. The transfected cells were selected in growth medium containing 600 μg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island, NY). After 4–8 weeks, individual cell colonies were transferred for clone expansion and maintained in culture medium supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418. Protein expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis of G418-selected cell foci using anti-Myc tag mAb 9E10 (Calbiochem) or an anti-MEK antibody (New England Biolabs) for Pak1 and MEK transfections, respectively. Blots were visualized with the procedure outlined in the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RBM(1–5) cell lines were seeded onto 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells per well in growth medium and grown overnight prior to the initiation of any experimental treatments. Following the indicated treatments, MTT (5 μg/ml) was added to each well of a 96-well plate and the reduction of MTT was assayed to calculate cell numbers as previously described (30Barry O.P. Savani R.C. Pratico D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 136-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded sparsely in 6-well plates, and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics for 24 h. The cells were then starved by culturing in the same medium without serum for 48 h. The medium was then removed, and cells were refed with medium containing 10% FCS and 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cells were incubated for 48 h after which [3H]thymidine incorporation was performed as previously described (31Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). For experiments using various kinase inhibitors, cytotoxicity was measured by the MTT cell viability assay described above. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by using analysis of variance with subsequent application of Student's t test, as appropriate. To determine whether ERKs are activated in esophagogastric RBM we evaluated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 using phosphospecific antibodies as an index of ERK1/2 activation (27Barry O.P. Kazanietz M.G. Pratico D. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7545-7556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All five of the RBM cell lines when cultured in 0.5% FCS, had substantially higher levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 when compared with HBMS cells, HT-29, CACO-2, SW480, and OC1, -2, and -3 (Fig.1 B). ERK1/2 was defined as constitutively activated in RBM(1–5) as cells grown in the presence of serum (S) or treated with PMA for 5 min did not demonstrate a further increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). Results are shown for RBM1 but similar results were observed for RBM(2–5) (data not shown). Since previous reports have linked constitutive ERK activation with ERK hyperexpression (20Kim S.C. Hahn J.-S. Min Y.H. Yoo N.-C. Ko Y.-W. Lee W.-J. Blood. 1999; 93: 3893-3899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sivaraman V.S. Wang H.-Y. Nuovo G.J. Malbon C.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), we examined ERK expression by immunoblot analysis. We failed to see any significant difference in ERK protein expression when RBM(1–5) cell lines were compared with HBMS cells, HT-29, CACO-2, SW480 and OC1, -2, and -3 (Fig. 1 A). To verify that the observed phosphorylated ERK1/2 in RBM(1–5) was active and capable of in vitro phosphorylation of cellular proteins, we used immunoprecipitated ERK from equal volumes of protein extracted from RBM(1–5). HBMS cells and cells grown in the presence of 10% FCS were employed for comparison purposes in in vitrokinase assays with myelin basic protein as a substrate. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1 C which corroborates Western blot data analysis (Fig. 1 B), again demonstrating a marked increase in the activation state of ERK in RBM cells compared with normal HBMS cells. No further increase in ERK activity was observed when RBM1 cells were grown in the presence of 10% FCS (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were obtained for RBM(2–5) (data not shown). To address the question of whether other members of the MAPK cascade could also be constitutively activated, we examined the phosphorylation of both JNK and p38. We failed to see either JNK or p38 phosphorylation in each of the five cell lines examined (Fig. 1, D andE). Treatment of the RBM1 cell line with UV for 5 min is shown as a positive control (Fig. 1, D andE). To address the mechanism(s) of constitutive ERK1/2 activation in RBM(1–5), cells were pretreated for 1 h with GF 109203X (5 μm), a PKC inhibitor (32Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GF 109203X (5 μm) abolished ERK1/2 activation while the PKA inhibitor H-89 (10 μm) was without effect (Fig.2 A). Likewise, staurosporine (100 nm), a nonspecific serine threonine kinase inhibitor, also abolished RBM(1–5) ERK1/2 constitutive activation (Fig.2 A). Results are shown for RBM1 but similar results were observed for RBM(2–5) (data not shown). Since MEK is the upstream activator of ERKs (33Crews C.M. Alessandrini A. Erikson R.L. Science. 1992; 258: 478-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 34Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11435-11439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we addressed the role of MEK1/2 in the observed constitutive activation of ERK-1 and -2 in RBM(1–5). Cells were incubated with PD 98059 (20 μm) or U0126 (20 μm), both inhibitors of MEK (35Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

The compound U0126 has been identified as a selective inhibitor of MEK-1 and MEK-2, bothin vitro and in vivo (36Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we observed that both inhibitors failed to alter the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in RBM(1–5) (Fig. 2 A). Again, results are shown for RBM1 but similar results were observed for RBM(2–5) (data not shown). To verify that both inhibitors, however, could abolish ERK phosphorylation, HBMS cells were pretreated with PD 98059 (20 μm) and U0126 (20 μm) for 1 h. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was completely abolished in the presence of both inhibitors when serum-starved HBMS cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FCS (S) for 24 h or treated with PMA (100 nm) for 5 min (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, both inhibitors are fully capable of “shutting down” activation of the MAPK pathway. To investigate the role that PI3K may have in RBM(1–5) constitutive ERK1/2 activation, cells were treated with two PI3K inhibitors LY294002 (20 μm) and wortmannin (100 nm) (37Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar).

This adaptation is sustained, in part, by a cell-specific stabilization of the glutaminase mRNA that leads to an increased synthesis of the mitochondrial glutaminase. A direct repeat of an 8-base AU sequence within the 3′-nontranslated region of the glutaminase mRNA binds a unique protein with high affinity and specificity. Expression of various chimeric mRNAs in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells demonstrated that a single 8-base AU sequence is both necessary and sufficient to function as a pH response element (pH RE). A biotinylated oligoribonucleotide containing the direct repeat was used as an affinity ligand to purify the pH RE-binding protein from a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex. The purified binding activity retained the same specific binding properties as observed with crude extracts and correlated with the elution of a 36-kDa protein. Microsequencing by mass spectroscopy and Western blot analysis were used to identify this protein as ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase. The purified protein contained eight tryptic peptides that were identical to sequences found in mouse ζ-crystallin and three peptides that differed by only a single amino acid. The observed differences may represent substitutions found in the rat homolog. A second protein purified by this protocol was identified as T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein (TIAR). However, the purified TIAR neither bound nor affected the binding of ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase to the pH RE. Furthermore, specific antibodies to ζ-crystallin, but not TIAR, blocked the formation of the complex between the pH RE and either the crude cytosolic extract or the purified protein.

Thus, ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase is a pH response element-binding protein. glutaminase β-globin pH response element mass spectrometry T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In contrast to other tissues, where glutamine metabolism is largely constitutive, the renal catabolism of glutamine is acutely activated in response to the onset of metabolic acidosis (1Tannen R.L. Handbook of Physiology: Renal Physiology.in: Orloff J. Berliner R.W. I. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1017-1059Google Scholar, 2Brosnan J.T. Vinay P. Gougoux A. Halperin M.L. pH Homeostasis: Mechanism and Control.in: Häussinger D. Academic Press, New York1988: 281-304Google Scholar). During normal acid-base balance, very little of the plasma glutamine is extracted and catabolized within the kidney (3Squires E.J. Hall D.E. Brosnan J.T. Biochem. J. 1976; 160: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, during metabolic acidosis renal ammoniagenesis and gluconeogenesis are greatly increased, and the kidney becomes the primary site of glutamine catabolism (4Welbourne T.C. Phromphecharat V. Givens G. Joshi S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: F457-F463PubMed Google Scholar). This process generates ammonium ions and bicarbonate ions that facilitate the excretion of acids and partially restore normal acid-base balance (2Brosnan J.T. Vinay P. Gougoux A. Halperin M.L. pH Homeostasis: Mechanism and Control.in: Häussinger D. Academic Press, New York1988: 281-304Google Scholar). During chronic acidosis, the increased glutamine catabolism in rat kidney is sustained, in part, by increased expression of multiple genes that encode the regulatory enzymes and transport proteins that participate in this adaptive response. The mitochondrial glutaminase (GA)1 catalyzes the initial reaction in the primary pathway of renal glutamine catabolism. Glutaminase activity is increased 7- to 20-fold within the renal proximal convoluted tubule during chronic acidosis (5Curthoys N.P. Lowry O.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wright P.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F961-F970PubMed Google Scholar). This increase results from an increased rate of glutaminase synthesis (7Tong J. Harrison G. Curthoys N.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that correlates with a similar increase in the level of GA mRNA (8Tong J. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2773-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,9Hwang J.-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms of GA mRNA that are expressed in rat kidney result from the use of alternative polyadenylation sites. The levels of both mRNAs are coordinately affected by changes in acid-base balance. However, the rate of transcription of the GA gene is not increased during either acute (9Hwang J.-J. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9392-9396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or chronic acidosis (10Hwang J.-J. Perera S. Shapiro R.A. Curthoys N.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7522-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Instead, the increase in glutaminase activity results from the selective stabilization of the GA mRNA (11Curthoys N.P. Watford M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 133-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The stabilization of the GA mRNA was initially demonstrated by stable transfection of various β-globin (βG) constructs (12Hansen W.R. Barsic-Tress N. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F126-F131PubMed Google Scholar) into LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells, a pH-responsive porcine proximal tubule-like cell line (13Gstraunthaler G. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 252: C232-C238Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of pβG produced a high level of a very stable mRNA (t 12 > 30 h) that was not affected by transfer of the cells to acidic medium (pH 6.9, 10 mmHCO 3−). In contrast, pβG-GA, which encodes an mRNA containing an additional 956 bases from the 3′-nontranslated region that is common to both GA mRNAs, was expressed at significantly lower levels. The decreased expression resulted from the more rapid turnover (t 12 = 4.6 h) of the βG-GA mRNA. Transfer of the latter cells to acidic medium resulted in a pronounced stabilization (6-fold) and a gradual induction of the βG-GA mRNA. These studies indicated that the 3′-nontranslated region of the GA mRNA contains a pH response element (pH RE). Experiments using additional chimeric βG constructs indicated that a 340-base segment of the GA mRNA, termed R-2, retained most of the functional characteristics of the 3′-nontranslated region (14Laterza O.F. Hansen W.R. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22481-22488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Mapping studies, using RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays, demonstrated that the specific binding of a unique protein mapped to the 29-nucleotide R-2I RNA that contained a direct repeat of an 8-base AU sequence. Site-directed mutation of the direct repeat of the 8-base AU sequence completely abolished the pH-responsive stabilization of the βG-GA mRNA (15Laterza O.F. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F970-F977PubMed Google Scholar). A βG reporter construct that contained the 3′-nontranslated region of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA, pβG-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, was designed to further test the function of the AU element. When expressed in LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells, the half-life of the βG-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA was only slightly stabilized (1.3-fold) by growth in acidic medium. However, insertion of short segments of GA cDNA containing either the direct repeat or a single 8-base AU sequence was sufficient to impart a 5-fold pH-responsive stabilization to the chimeric mRNA. Thus, either the direct repeat or a single copy of the 8-base AU sequence is both necessary and sufficient to function as a pH RE. The apparent binding to the pH RE is increased 3-fold in cytosolic extracts prepared from LLC-PK1-FBPase+ cells that were grown in acidic medium (16Laterza O.F. Curthoys N.P. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1583-1588PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts prepared from the renal cortex of rats that were made acutely acidotic also exhibit a similar increase in binding to the direct repeat of the pH RE. The time course for the increase in binding correlates with the temporal increase in GA mRNA. Thus, the protein that binds to the pH RE may mediate the pH-responsive stabilization of the GA mRNA. In the current study, an affinity ligand containing the pH RE was used to purify a 36-kDa protein from a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex. This protein binds to the R-2I RNA with the same specificity as the pH RE-binding protein that is contained in a crude extract. Through MS/MS microsequencing and Western blot analysis, the purified protein was identified as ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase. Furthermore, antiserum specific for ζ-crystallin blocks the formation of the complex formed between the R2-I RNA and either the purified protein or the crude cytosolic extract. Thus, ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase is a pH RE-binding protein. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (140–160 g) were acquired from Charles River Laboratories.

RNasin was obtained fromPromega. GelBond PAG films were purchased from Intermountain Scientific. DNA preparation kits were from Promega or Qiagen. Slide-a-lyzer cassettes were obtained from Pierce. Other chemicals were acquired from Sigma. Anti-sera against ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase (17Gonzalez P. Hernandez-Calzadilla C. Rao P.V. Rodriguez I.R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Borras T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Samuel Zigler, Jr. (National Eye Institute). A monoclonal antibody against the T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-related protein, TIAR (18Taupin J.-L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Kedersha (Harvard Medical School). Rats were made acidotic by stomach loading with 20 mmol of NH4Cl/kg of body mass and then providing 0.28 mm NH4Cl as the sole source of drinking water. After 18–24 h, the rats were anesthetized with 1 mg of pentobarbital/kg of body mass and opened with a midline incision. The kidneys were perfused in situ with Krebs-Henseleit solution, then removed, decapsulated, sliced longitudinally, and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit solution. The cortex was dissected free of papilla and medulla and then cut into small pieces. The cortical tissue was placed in an equal volume of 40 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 mmpotassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm antipain, and 5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g to pellet intact cells and nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min to pellet the mitochondria and then for 90 min at 100,000 × g to pellet membrane-bound organelles and polyribosomes. The final supernatant was divided into 100-μl aliquots and stored frozen at −70 °C. The protein concentration of the cytosolic extract was determined by a Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The R-2I plasmid (14Laterza O.F. Hansen W.R. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22481-22488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) was digested with BssHII and XbaI, and the DNA fragment containing the T7 promoter and the R-2I template was purified by electrophoresis on an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The R-2I RNA was transcribed in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing the following components: 100 ng of template DNA; 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP; 0.5 mm ATP, CTP, and GTP; 50 μM unlabeled UTP; 20 units of RNAsin; and 10 mmdithiothreitol. After the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, 1.0 unit of RNase-free DNase was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The RNA was then purified by chromatography on a Micro Bio-spin column, and its concentration was determined by scintillation counting. Syntheses of unlabeled RNAs were performed using a 100-μl reaction volume lacking [α-32P]UTP but containing a 0.5 mm concentration of each ribonucleotide. The appropriate templates were prepared as described previously (14Laterza O.F. Hansen W.R. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22481-22488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Laterza O.F. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F970-F977PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of the unlabeled RNA samples were determined by measuring their absorbance at 260 nm and using specific extinction coefficients calculated from the nucleotide composition of the individual transcripts. Either 3 μg of a rat renal cortical extract or 10–50 ng of purified protein were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mmpotassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 μg of yeast tRNA, 0.5% Igepal CA 630, 5% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10 units of RNAsin. Where indicated, specific antibodies were added, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 20 fmol of labeled R2-I RNA was added. For competition experiments, specific or nonspecific competitors (100-fold excess) were also added. The samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then subjected to electrophoresis for 90 min in a 5% polyacrylamide gel at 170 V using a 90 mm Tris, 110 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA running buffer. The gels were dried and imaged using a PhosphorImager screen. The following oligonucleotide was synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Ft. Collins, CO): 5′-TTAGUGUGACUCUUUAAAUAUUAAAAUAAUUACUACUAACUGUUCATTdATTT-3′. The 5′-end contained two deoxythymidines, and the 3′-end contained six deoxyribonucleotides including two biotinylated thymidines (Glen Research, Sterling, VA; indicated in bold). The remainder of the oligonucleotide was composed of a sequence of ribonucleotides derived from the GA mRNA. The underlined nucleotides are the direct repeat of the 8-base AU sequence that constitutes the pH response element of the GA mRNA (15Laterza O.F. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F970-F977PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of the affinity ligand and the R-2I and R-2H RNAs is shown in Fig. 1. A 1-ml sample of a rat renal cortical cytosolic extract (∼20 mg of total protein) was dialyzed overnight against 1× binding buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The following additions were made to the dialyzed extract: 40 μl of 10% Igepal CA 630, 1 mg of tRNA, 20 μmol of dithiothreitol, and 20 μl of RNAsin (40 units/μl). The sample was then incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. The biotinylated RNA ligand was centrifuged through a Micro Bio-spin P6 column. Approximately 2 nmol of the purified RNA were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for an additional 20 min. A fast protein liquid chromatography column was packed with 0.5 ml of avidin agarose (10-fold excess with respect to the biotinylated RNA) and washed extensively with 1× binding buffer. The total sample was loaded at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min, and the column was then washed at 0.05 ml/min with 110 ml of binding buffer in which the concentrations of the potassium acetate and magnesium acetate were gradually increased 4-fold. The binding activity was then eluted with 5 ml of buffer in which the potassium acetate and magnesium acetate concentrations were linearly increased from 4× to 20×. The collected fractions (0.5 ml) were dialyzed versus 1× binding buffer and assayed by RNA gel shift analysis. To assess purity, samples from the collected fractions containing 10 ng of protein were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 1% SDS and stained with 0.1% silver nitrate. The proteins contained in 150-μl samples of the individual column fractions were concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation (20Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar) and washed with methanol. The protein pellets were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% separating gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with either a 1:500 dilution of ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase antiserum or a 1:2000 dilution of TIAR monoclonal antibody. The membrane was then incubated with a 1:1500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Images were developed with the ECL-Plus kit and visualized on a Storm system (Molecular Dynamics). The electrophoresis unit and all glassware were incubated overnight with 2% cleansing concentrate (Bio-Rad), followed by extensive washing with doubly deionized H2O. The purified protein was concentrated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with freshly prepared Coomassie Blue. The 36-kDa protein band was excised, sealed in an Eppendorf tube, and sent to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility (William S. Lane) for analysis. The protein was subjected to in-gel reduction, carboxyamidomethylation, and tryptic digestion. Multiple peptide sequences were determined by microcapillary reverse-phase chromatography coupled to a Finnigan LCQ quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Interpretation of the resulting MS/MS spectra were facilitated by software developed in the Harvard Microchemistry Facility and by data base correlation with the algorithm SEQUEST (21Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Rollar P.P. Lung P.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A biotinylated RNA (Fig. 1) was designed as a ligand for the affinity purification of the pH RE-binding protein. When used as a probe in an RNA gel shift assay, the affinity ligand bound to the pH RE-binding protein with an affinity equivalent to that observed with the R-2I RNA (data not shown). Therefore, a cytosolic extract from rat kidney cortex was incubated with a sufficient excess of the affinity ligand to bind all of the pH RE-binding protein. The resulting complex was then applied to a fast protein liquid chromatography column that had been packed with avidin-agarose and equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was washed extensively and then eluted with binding buffer in which the concentrations of potassium acetate and magnesium acetate were increased proportionately. The eluant through the wash with 4× binding buffer (100 mm potassium acetate and 10 mm magnesium acetate) contained very little R-2I RNA binding activity. Thus, 0.5-ml fractions were routinely collected only as the steep gradient of 4× to 20× binding buffer was applied to the column. An aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. As shown in Fig. 2 A, two proteins were recovered in these fractions. The elution of a 43-kDa protein peaked in fraction 4, and a 36-kDa protein peaked in fraction 7. When larger volumes of the peak fractions were concentrated by chloroform/methanol precipitation and subjected to SDS-PAGE, additional protein bands were observed. However, the additional proteins constituted less than 5% of the total protein (data not shown). To measure the R-2I RNA binding activity, the fractions were dialyzed overnight against 1× binding buffer and then analyzed in an RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the amount of R2-I-protein complex formed closely correlates with the elution profile for the 36-kDa protein. The ratio of binding activity to the amount of 36-kDa protein quantified by silver staining was nearly constant across the elution profile (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that this protein is the pH RE-binding protein. To further support this conclusion, the affinity purification was repeated using a shallower gradient of the 4× to 20× binding buffer to separate the proteins into 28 fractions. Analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (data not shown) indicated that fraction 13 contained only the 43-kDa protein, whereas fraction 20 contained only the 36-kDa protein. After dialysis, the two fractions were tested for R2-I RNA binding activity (Fig. 3). Again, only the fraction containing the 36-kDa protein formed an RNA-protein complex. The fraction containing the 43-kDa protein neither bound the R-2I RNA nor affected the level or mobility of the complex formed with the 36-kDa protein. Thus, the purified 43-kDa protein does not form a specific complex with the R-2I RNA. Competition experiments were performed to determine the specificity of the binding interaction between the purified pH RE-binding protein and the R2-I RNA (Fig. 4). For a control, the same binding experiment was performed using a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex. The complexes produced with both protein samples exhibited identical electrophoretic mobilities. A 100-fold excess of various unlabeled RNAs was added to compare specificity. The mut1, mut2, and mut3 competitors (14Laterza O.F. Hansen W.R. Taylor L. Curthoys N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22481-22488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are R2-I RNAs in which the first, second, and both of the AU-rich regions, respectively, were mutated. The (AUUU)5A RNA contains five tandem repeats of an AUUUA sequence. This sequence binds a variety of AUUUA-binding proteins (22Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). The pBS RNA was transcribed from the multicloning site of pBlueScript SK(+) and was included as a nonspecific competitor. Finally, the R2-H RNA is a 76-nucleotide sequence that includes all of R2-I plus flanking sequences from the GA mRNA (Fig. 1 A). Formation of the protein-R2-I complex with either the purified protein or the crude extract was almost completely inhibited by the R2-H RNA. In addition, both complexes were slightly competed by the (AUUU)5A and mut2 RNAs, but not any of the other RNAs. Thus, the purified pH RE-binding protein exhibits a specificity identical to that observed with the crude extract. The purified and concentrated pH RE-binding protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The 36-kDa protein band was cut from the gel, digested with trypsin, and sequenced by mass spectroscopy. A total of 13 peptides were identified. The peptides were classified into two groups. Class I peptides include eight sequences that are identical to tryptic peptides derived from the 36-kDa mouse ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase protein. Three other Class I peptides differ from tryptic peptides of mouse ζ-crystallin by a single amino acid substitution and may represent sequences from the rat homolog. The two Class II peptides correspond to tryptic peptides contained in the 43-kDa mouse RNA-binding protein, TIAR. The identities of the two proteins contained in the purified preparation of the pH RE-binding protein were confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5). Antisera produced against the full-length ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase purified from a guinea pig lens (17Gonzalez P. Hernandez-Calzadilla C. Rao P.V. Rodriguez I.R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Borras T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar) reacted with only the single 36-kDa protein when tested versus a crude cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex (data not shown). When used versus a purified sample containing both the 43- and 36-kDa proteins (Fig. 5 A), the anti-ζ-crystallin antibody again bound only to the 36-kDa protein (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, a monoclonal antibody (18Taupin J.-L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), which is specific for TIAR, bound to only the 43-kDa protein. Thus, a slight contamination of the isolated 36-kDa protein band with the larger protein accounts for the two Class II peptides that were identified by microsequencing. Immunoblocking assays were performed to confirm that ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase is a pH RE-binding protein (Fig.6 A). Preincubation of a cytosolic extract of rat renal cortex with increasing amounts of anti-ζ-crystallin antiserum completely blocked the formation of the specific R2-I RNA-protein complex. The same inhibition pattern was observed when the gel shifts were performed with the purified pH RE-binding protein (data not shown). The observed inhibition was specific, because anti-glutaminase antiserum (23Curthoys N.P. Kuhlenschmidt T. Godfrey S.S. Weiss R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 172: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) had no effect on the complex formation (Fig. 6 A). The affinity ligand used to purify the pH RE-binding protein was slightly longer than the R2-I RNA probe. Thus, labeled R-2H RNA, which contains all of the ribonucleotides present in the RNA affinity ligand, was synthesized and used as a probe for gel shift analysis (Fig. 6 B). Because of the larger size of this probe, the resulting complex was digested with RNase T1 before electrophoresis. Again, the resulting complex is completely blocked by preincubation with anti-ζ-crystallin antiserum but is not affected by pretreatment with antibody specific for TIAR. Thus, ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase binds with high affinity and specificity to the pH RE. RNA-binding proteins play an important role in the turnover of mRNAs (24Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, mRNAs that encode various cytokines (25Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar), transcription factors (26Shyu A.-B. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), and other immediate-early gene products (27Alberta J.A. Rundell K. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4532-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) generally turn over with half-lives of less than 1 h. Specific AU-rich elements within the coding sequence or the 3′-nontranslated region of the mRNAs function as instability elements (22Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). They recruit proteins that enhance 3′-deadenylation and the loss of poly(A)-binding proteins, leading to the rapid exonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA. Alternatively, the turnover of an mRNA may be initiated by a site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage that generates sites for rapid exonucleolytic degradation (28Binder R. Horowitz J.A. Basilion J.P. Koeller D.M. Klausner R.D. Harford J.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,29Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6334-6341Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Selective stabilization of the latter class of mRNAs is mediated by sequence-specific binding of unique proteins that inhibit the endonucleolytic cleavage. In the current study, an affinity ligand was used to purify from rat kidney cortex the protein that binds to the pH RE of the GA mRNA. The purified protein formed a complex with the R-2I RNA that retained the same electrophoretic mobility and specificity as observed with the crude cytosolic extract. In both cases, the observed binding was strongly competed by an oligonucleotide (R-2H) that contained both AU elements. When characterized as independent binding sites, the initial 8-nucleotide element of the direct repeat was shown to have greater affinity for the pH RE-binding protein. 2J. Schroeder and N. P. Curthoys, unpublished data. These data are consistent with the observation that the mut2 oligonucleotide, which retains the initial 8-base element, functions as a weak competitor. The (AUUU)5A oligonucleotide was previously shown to be a weak competitor (15Laterza O.F. Curthoys N.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F970-F977PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other tested oligonucleotides was able to compete the specific binding observed with either the crude extract or the purified pH RE-binding protein. The preparation of purified pH RE-binding protein contained two proteins that were identified by MS/MS sequencing and Western blot analysis. One of the proteins was the TIAR, a well known RNA-binding protein that contains three RNA recognition motifs (30Dember L. Kim N.D. Liu K.-Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). TIAR may participate in Fas-mediated apoptotic cell death (18Taupin J.-L. Tian Q. Kedersha N. Robertson M. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1629-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Kawakami A. Tian Q. Duan X. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It also binds to the AU-rich element that mediates the translational regulation of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA (32Gueydan C. Droogmans L. Chalon P. Huez G. Caput D. Kruys V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2322-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An in vitroanalysis of its binding preference revealed that TIAR also has an affinity for RNAs that contain short stretches of uridylate residues (30Dember L. Kim N.D. Liu K.-Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This broad specificity may account for the purification of TIAR by the AU-rich pH RE affinity ligand. However, the purified TIAR failed to bind to either the R-2I or the longer R-2H RNA. In addition, specific antibodies to TIAR did not block formation of specific complexes that are formed by incubating either RNA with a cytosolic extract of rat kidney cortex. Thus, it is unlikely that TIAR functions as a pH RE-binding protein. The second protein identified in the purified preparation of the pH RE-binding protein was ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase. ζ-crystallin constitutes 10% of the total protein present in the lens of hystricomorph rodents (33Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and camelids (34Garland D. Rao P.V. Del Corso A. Mura U. Zigler Jr., J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 285: 134-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these species, the ζ-crystallin gene contains an alternative promoter that accounts for its lens-specific overexpression (17Gonzalez P. Hernandez-Calzadilla C. Rao P.V. Rodriguez I.R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Borras T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar, 35Lee D.C. Gonzalez P. Wistow G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Gonzalez P. Rao P.V. Nunez S.B. Zigler Jr., J.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 773-781PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other lens crystallins with a limited phylogenetic distribution, ζ-crystallin also has a catalytic activity and is expressed at enzymatic levels in various tissues of different species (17Gonzalez P. Hernandez-Calzadilla C. Rao P.V. Rodriguez I.R. Zigler Jr., J.S. Borras T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 305-315PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gonzalez P. Rao P.V. Zigler Jr., J.S. Genomics. 1994; 21: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 38Rao P.V. Zigler Jr., J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1117: 315-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ζ-crystallin possesses a novel NADPH-dependent quinone oxidoreductase activity that reduces various quinones through the sequential transfer of single electrons (33Rao P.V. Krishna C.M. Zigler Jr., J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ζ-Crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase was not previously known to function as an RNA-binding protein. However, the ability of bovine ζ-crystallin to bind to different forms of DNAs had been quantified through an ELISA assay (39Gagna C.E. Chen J.H. Kuo H.-R. Lambert W.C. Cell Biol. Int. 1998; 22: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It preferentially binds to double-stranded Z-DNA and to single-stranded DNA but has a 5–7-fold lower affinity for double-stranded B-DNA. The sequence specificity of the observed interactions was not examined. However, the binding of ζ-crystallin to single-stranded DNA was effectively competed by NADPH. Thus, the NADPH binding site of ζ-crystallin may constitute a portion of its DNA binding site. The observation that antiserum versusmouse ζ-crystallin reacts specifically with the 36-kDa protein contained in the purified pH RE-binding protein and blocks formation of the specific complex formed with the pH RE indicates that the ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase also has a high affinity binding site for the AU-rich pH RE. The onset of metabolic acidosis may activate a signal transduction pathway that results in increased expression and/or covalent modification of the pH RE-binding protein. Identification of ζ-crystallin/NADPH:quinone reductase as a pH RE-binding protein will facilitate the characterization of the process by which this binding activity is enhanced during acidosis and the mechanism by which this interaction leads to the cell-specific stabilization of the GA mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1980377002,"Thromboxane synthase (TXAS) is a “non-classical” cytochrome P450. Without any need for an external electron donor, or for a reductase or molecular oxygen, it uses prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to catalyze either an isomerization reaction to form thromboxane A2(TXA2) or a fragmentation reaction to form 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) at a ratio of 1:1:1 (TXA2:heptadecatrienoic acid:MDA). We report here kinetics of TXAS with heme ligands in binding study and with PGH2 in enzymatic study. We determined that 1) binding of U44069, an oxygen-based ligand, is a two-step process; U44069 first binds TXAS, then ligates the heme-iron with a maximal rate constant of 105–130 s−1; 2) binding of cyanide, a carbon-based ligand, is a one-step process with kon of 2.4m−1 s−1 andkoff of 0.112 s−1; and 3) both imidazole and clotrimazole (nitrogen-based ligands) bind TXAS in a two-step process; an initial binding to the heme-iron with on-rate constants of 8.4 × 104m−1s−1 and 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1 for imidazole and clotrimazole, respectively, followed by a slow conformational change with off-rate constants of 8.8 s−1 and 0.53 s−1, respectively. The results of our binding study indicate that the TXAS active site is hydrophobic and spacious. In addition, steady-state kinetic study revealed that TXAS consumed PGH2 at a rate of 3,800 min−1 and that thekcat/Km for PGH2 consumption was 3 × 106m−1 s−1. Based on these data, TXAS appears to be a very efficient catalyst. Surprisingly, rapid-scan stopped-flow experiments revealed marginal absorbance changes upon mixing TXAS with PGH2, indicating minimal accumulation of any heme-derived intermediates. Freeze-quench EPR measurements for the same reaction showed minimal change of heme redox state. Further kinetic analysis using a combination of rapid-mixing chemical quench and computer simulation showed that the kinetic parameters of TXAS-catalyzed reaction are: PGH2 bound TXAS at a rate of 1.2–2.0 × 107m−1s−1; the rate of catalytic conversion of PGH2to TXA2 or MDA was at least 15,000 s−1 and the lower limit of the rates for products release was 4,000–6,000 s−1. Given that the cellular PGH2concentration is quite low, we concluded that under physiological conditions, the substrate-binding step is the rate-limiting step of the TXAS-catalyzed reaction, in sharp contrast with “classical” P450 enzymes. Thromboxane synthase (TXAS) is a “non-classical” cytochrome P450. Without any need for an external electron donor, or for a reductase or molecular oxygen, it uses prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) to catalyze either an isomerization reaction to form thromboxane A2(TXA2) or a fragmentation reaction to form 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid and malondialdehyde (MDA) at a ratio of 1:1:1 (TXA2:heptadecatrienoic acid:MDA).

It is believed to be a crucial factor contributing to a variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and primary pulmonary hypertension (1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granstrom E. Hamberg M. Hammarstrom S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Botting R. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). TXA2 is rather labile, being hydrolyzed to the biologically inactive thromboxane B2 (TXB2) with a half-life of about 30 s in aqueous solution at 37 °C (3Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Its biosynthesis is accomplished by thromboxane synthase (TXAS) using prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) as the substrate. Notably, the formation of TXA2 is accompanied by those of 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) at a ratio of 1:1:1 (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (SchemeFS1). The biological functions of MDA and HHT are unclear. However, MDA can form adducts with lysine residues of proteins or with amine head groups of phospholipids and its adducts have been detected in atherosclerotic lesions of human aorta (5Uchida K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It was also shown to participate in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct which may contribute to the etiology of human genetic disease and cancer (6Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Reddy G.R. Yeola S.N. Morrow J.D. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar).TXAS is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human TXAS was assigned as CYP 5A1. Unlike other microsomal P450s that require the ubiquitous P450 reductase to shuttle electrons for the mono-oxygenation reaction, TXAS undergoes an isomerization reaction without reductase or molecular oxygen. A “classical” P450 accepts an electron from the reductase and converts heme iron to the Fe(II) state, followed by binding of molecular oxygen and another one-electron reduction. The subsequent steps, including oxygen bond cleavage and oxidation of the substrate, occur rapidly and have been difficult to resolve (8Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450; Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-124Crossref Google Scholar). However, for P450cam, the rate constants of oxygen binding and substrate hydroxylation were determined to be 4.1 × 105m−1 s−1 and 34 s−1, respectively (9Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intermediates of the later steps in the P450cam reaction were well characterized in a recent time-resolved x-ray crystallographic study in which the presence of an oxyferryl intermediate after breakdown of molecular oxygen was identified (10Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar).TXAS, which uses an endoperoxide as the substrate, apparently undergoes a different mechanism. Hecker and Ullrich (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a mechanistic model for TXAS involving a homolytic scission of PGH2 that led to the formation of heme-Fe(IV) and alkoxy radical intermediates for enzyme and substrate species, respectively. In the present study, we attempted to characterize the intermediates of the TXAS reaction employing optical and EPR spectroscopies. EPR studies failed to identify any radical species. Stopped-flow spectroscopy revealed no significant absorbance changes at the heme center. Further kinetic analysis using the rapid-mixing chemical quench and computer simulation showed that the substrate-binding step is the rate-limiting step of TXAS-catalyzed reaction, and that the catalytic conversion of PGH2 to TXA2 or MDA by TXAS was remarkably fast.DISCUSSIONTXAS, as a resting enzyme, has a typical low spin P450 heme with an oxygen-based distal ligand (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hsu P.-Y. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 762-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several types of heme ligands including U44069 (oxygen-based ligand), imidazole, clotrimazole (both are nitrogen-based ligands), and cyanide (carbon-based ligand) were studied to determine their kinetic binding characteristics with TXAS using stopped-flow spectroscopy. All these ligands caused Type II spectral changes, indicating that the exogenous ligands formed a low-spin coordinate heme complex. However, their binding kinetics to TXAS were quite different. U44069 and cyanide binding to TXAS exhibited monophasic kinetics, in contrast to the biphasic kinetics found for imidazole and clotrimazole. Analysis ofkobs versus ligand concentrations further indicated that cyanide underwent a one-step binding process, whereas U44069, imidazole, and clotrimazole underwent two-step binding processes.Interestingly, the binding mechanisms of those ligands involved in the two-step binding processes are distinctly different. U44069 first binds TXAS, but not heme iron, and then replaces the original heme ligand. The two nitrogen-based ligands, nonetheless, bind heme iron first and then undergo a conformational change before they reach equilibrium. Cyanide, which is charged but is the smallest molecule tested, had the lowest on-rate constant (2.4 m−1s−1). This low rate constant compared with other hemoproteins is likely due to the strong electron-donating thiolate ligand. On the other hand, clotrimazole, although much bulkier than imidazole, had a higher on-rate constant (8.4 × 104m−1 s−1 and 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1 for imidazole and clotrimazole, respectively). These results indicated that the TXAS active site is both hydrophobic and spacious, consistent with our previously reported findings (13Hsu P.-Y. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 762-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Classical eukaryotic P450s catalyze hydroxylation reactions at a very slow rate with kcat of 1–10 mol of product formed/min/mol of P450 (21Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many prokaryotic P450s, however, have somewhat higher catalytic activities. For example, P450camcatalyzes the reaction at a rate of ∼1900 mol/min/mol of protein (22Peterson J.A. Mock D.M. Cooper D.Y. Rosenthal O. Synder R. Witmer C. Cytochrome P450 and b5. Plenum Press, New York1975: 311-324Google Scholar), and so does P450BM-3 (23Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a soluble protein in which the reductase domain is naturally fused to the oxygenase domain. For the “non-classical” P450s such as allene-oxide synthase and nitric-oxide reductase that do not need reductase for catalysis, the turnover numbers seems to be much higher. Allene-oxide synthase, a P450 acting as a dehydrase which converts lipid hydroperoxide to allene oxide, appears to form product at a rate of >60,000 mol/min/mol of protein (24Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nitric-oxide reductase, i.e.P450nor, which catalyzes NO to N2O has a turnover number of 72,000 mol/min/mol of protein (25Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, prostacyclin synthase, another non-classical P450 that uses PGH2 as the natural substrate, has a lower turnover number (∼150 mol/min/mol of protein) (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hara S. Miyata A. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Brugger R. Lottspeich F. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19897-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TXAS, as observed in this study, formed MDA or TXA2 at a rate of 1,900 min−1. In other words, TXAS consumed PGH2 at a rate of 3,800 min−1. Furthermore, the ratio ofkcat/Km (an index of catalytic efficiency) of TXAS for PGH2 consumption is thus 3 × 106m−1s−1. Compared with carbonic anhydrase, an extremely efficient enzyme that has a kcat/Km of 107-108m−1s−1 (27Lindskog S. Engberg P. Forsman C. Ibrahim S.A. Johnson B.H. Simonsson I. Tibell L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 429: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), TXAS should be considered as a very efficient catalyst. It should also be noted that many P450s including P450cam can act as non-classical P450s and convert PGH2 to MDA and HHT, but not TXA2, without reductase, molecular oxygen, or any electron donor (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their “HHT/MDA synthase” activities, nonetheless, are much lower than TXAS. A recent report showed that four microsomal P450s (P4501A2, 2B1, 2E1, and 3A4) had Kd for U44069 of ∼200 μm and when assayed at 50 μmPGH2, their catalytic activities were 1–10 min−1 (28Plastaras J.P. Guengerich P. Nebert D.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11784-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It would appear that PGH2 was readily converted to MDA and HHT by heme in the context of P450 where a hydrophobic environment is present. A study of chemical models for heme-catalyzed PGH2 reactions showed that 9% of HHT was formed in a phosphate buffer, whereas 33% of HHT was formed in acetonitrile, a less polar solvent (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TXAS is more efficient in HHT/MDA synthesis not only because its active site is hydrophobic but it also has a greater affinity for PGH2. Furthermore, several TXAS active site amino acid residues, as we have previously shown (29Wang L.-H. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-Y. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), may be involved in the reaction. It is intriguing to note that prostacyclin synthase, although it has a high affinity for PGH2 (Kd is ∼10 μm), does not catalyze HHT/MDA formation (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What structural elements determine the HHT/MDA activity of P450 remains a challenging topic.In this study, the rate constant of each catalytic step,i.e. PGH2 to TXA2 or MDA/HHT, is estimated to be ∼15,000 s−1. The half-life of the intermediate(s) at 23 °C is therefore much less than the dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus (∼1.5 ms). Furthermore, the rate constant of substrate binding is 12–20 × 106m−1 s−1 and the in vivo binding constant could be calculated if the cellular PGH2 concentration was known. To the best of our knowledge, cellular PGH2 concentration has not been reported due in part to the instability of PGH2 in aqueous solution. However, concentrations of arachidonic acid, the substrate for prostaglandin H synthase, in many inflammatory blood cells and lung tissues were less than 10 μm (30Triggiani M. Oriente A. Seeds M.C. Bass D.A. Marone G. Chilton F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In pancreatic islets, cellular un-esterified arachidonate concentrations of 38–75 μm were reported under glucose-induced conditions. But the maximally effective concentration, including exogenous arachidonic acid, was 30–40 μm (32Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since arachidonic acid is a substrate for many other pathways in addition to prostaglandin H synthase, it is probably safe to assume that the cellular PGH2 concentration is generally less than 40 μm. If that is the case, the substrate-binding rate constant for TXAS in the physiological conditions would be less than 800 s−1, and this value is much smaller than the other forward rate constants. We therefore conclude that the substrate-binding step is the rate-limiting step in the TXAS-catalyzed reaction.P450s were also classified according to the identity of their electron donors. Class I P450s require both ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase for electron transfer, whereas Class II P450s require only a P450 reductase (33Graham-Lorence S. Peterson J.A. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In both Class I and Class II P450s, the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction is at the stage of the second electron transfer to the heme center. Class III P450s that do not require any reductase, are not well characterized regarding their kinetic mechanisms. An elegant study on P450nor, a Class III P450, revealed that binding of NO and NADH substrates were fast to form the intermediate I, an NO-bound two-electron reduced species (25Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The intermediate I was slowly converted to the products. The rate-limiting step of P450nor is thus in the chemical steps. In contrast to other P450s, the rate-limiting step of TXAS is at the step of substrate binding. To the best of our knowledge, this kinetic mechanism is the first example of Class III P450s in which substrate binding is the rate-limiting step. Thromboxane A2(TXA2)1 is a potent inducer of vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation. It is believed to be a crucial factor contributing to a variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases such as atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and primary pulmonary hypertension (1Samuelsson B. Goldyne M. Granstrom E. Hamberg M. Hammarstrom S. Malmsten C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 997-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 2Vane J.R. Botting R. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). TXA2 is rather labile, being hydrolyzed to the biologically inactive thromboxane B2 (TXB2) with a half-life of about 30 s in aqueous solution at 37 °C (3Hamberg M. Svensson J. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2994-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Its biosynthesis is accomplished by thromboxane synthase (TXAS) using prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) as the substrate. Notably, the formation of TXA2 is accompanied by those of 12-l-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) at a ratio of 1:1:1 (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (SchemeFS1). The biological functions of MDA and HHT are unclear. However, MDA can form adducts with lysine residues of proteins or with amine head groups of phospholipids and its adducts have been detected in atherosclerotic lesions of human aorta (5Uchida K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). It was also shown to participate in the formation of an important endogenous DNA adduct which may contribute to the etiology of human genetic disease and cancer (6Chaudhary A.K. Nokubo M. Reddy G.R. Yeola S.N. Morrow J.D. Blair I.A. Marnett L.J. Science. 1994; 265: 1580-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). TXAS is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily and is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ruan K.-H. Wang L.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19483-19490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human TXAS was assigned as CYP 5A1. Unlike other microsomal P450s that require the ubiquitous P450 reductase to shuttle electrons for the mono-oxygenation reaction, TXAS undergoes an isomerization reaction without reductase or molecular oxygen. A “classical” P450 accepts an electron from the reductase and converts heme iron to the Fe(II) state, followed by binding of molecular oxygen and another one-electron reduction. The subsequent steps, including oxygen bond cleavage and oxidation of the substrate, occur rapidly and have been difficult to resolve (8Mueller E.J. Loida P.J. Sligar S.G. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450; Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 83-124Crossref Google Scholar). However, for P450cam, the rate constants of oxygen binding and substrate hydroxylation were determined to be 4.1 × 105m−1 s−1 and 34 s−1, respectively (9Gerber N.C. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4260-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intermediates of the later steps in the P450cam reaction were well characterized in a recent time-resolved x-ray crystallographic study in which the presence of an oxyferryl intermediate after breakdown of molecular oxygen was identified (10Schlichting I. Berendzen J. Chu K. Stock A.M. Maves S.A. Benson D.E. Sweet R.M. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Sligar S.G. Science. 2000; 287: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). TXAS, which uses an endoperoxide as the substrate, apparently undergoes a different mechanism. Hecker and Ullrich (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a mechanistic model for TXAS involving a homolytic scission of PGH2 that led to the formation of heme-Fe(IV) and alkoxy radical intermediates for enzyme and substrate species, respectively. In the present study, we attempted to characterize the intermediates of the TXAS reaction employing optical and EPR spectroscopies. EPR studies failed to identify any radical species. Stopped-flow spectroscopy revealed no significant absorbance changes at the heme center. Further kinetic analysis using the rapid-mixing chemical quench and computer simulation showed that the substrate-binding step is the rate-limiting step of TXAS-catalyzed reaction, and that the catalytic conversion of PGH2 to TXA2 or MDA by TXAS was remarkably fast. DISCUSSIONTXAS, as a resting enzyme, has a typical low spin P450 heme with an oxygen-based distal ligand (4Haurand M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15059-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hsu P.-Y. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 762-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Several types of heme ligands including U44069 (oxygen-based ligand), imidazole, clotrimazole (both are nitrogen-based ligands), and cyanide (carbon-based ligand) were studied to determine their kinetic binding characteristics with TXAS using stopped-flow spectroscopy. All these ligands caused Type II spectral changes, indicating that the exogenous ligands formed a low-spin coordinate heme complex. However, their binding kinetics to TXAS were quite different. U44069 and cyanide binding to TXAS exhibited monophasic kinetics, in contrast to the biphasic kinetics found for imidazole and clotrimazole. Analysis ofkobs versus ligand concentrations further indicated that cyanide underwent a one-step binding process, whereas U44069, imidazole, and clotrimazole underwent two-step binding processes.Interestingly, the binding mechanisms of those ligands involved in the two-step binding processes are distinctly different. U44069 first binds TXAS, but not heme iron, and then replaces the original heme ligand. The two nitrogen-based ligands, nonetheless, bind heme iron first and then undergo a conformational change before they reach equilibrium. Cyanide, which is charged but is the smallest molecule tested, had the lowest on-rate constant (2.4 m−1s−1). This low rate constant compared with other hemoproteins is likely due to the strong electron-donating thiolate ligand. On the other hand, clotrimazole, although much bulkier than imidazole, had a higher on-rate constant (8.4 × 104m−1 s−1 and 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1 for imidazole and clotrimazole, respectively). These results indicated that the TXAS active site is both hydrophobic and spacious, consistent with our previously reported findings (13Hsu P.-Y. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 762-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Classical eukaryotic P450s catalyze hydroxylation reactions at a very slow rate with kcat of 1–10 mol of product formed/min/mol of P450 (21Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10019-10022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many prokaryotic P450s, however, have somewhat higher catalytic activities. For example, P450camcatalyzes the reaction at a rate of ∼1900 mol/min/mol of protein (22Peterson J.A. Mock D.M. Cooper D.Y. Rosenthal O. Synder R. Witmer C. Cytochrome P450 and b5. Plenum Press, New York1975: 311-324Google Scholar), and so does P450BM-3 (23Narhi L.O. Fulco A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7160-7169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a soluble protein in which the reductase domain is naturally fused to the oxygenase domain. For the “non-classical” P450s such as allene-oxide synthase and nitric-oxide reductase that do not need reductase for catalysis, the turnover numbers seems to be much higher. Allene-oxide synthase, a P450 acting as a dehydrase which converts lipid hydroperoxide to allene oxide, appears to form product at a rate of >60,000 mol/min/mol of protein (24Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nitric-oxide reductase, i.e.P450nor, which catalyzes NO to N2O has a turnover number of 72,000 mol/min/mol of protein (25Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, prostacyclin synthase, another non-classical P450 that uses PGH2 as the natural substrate, has a lower turnover number (∼150 mol/min/mol of protein) (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hara S. Miyata A. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Brugger R. Lottspeich F. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. J. Biol.

In other words, TXAS consumed PGH2 at a rate of 3,800 min−1. Furthermore, the ratio ofkcat/Km (an index of catalytic efficiency) of TXAS for PGH2 consumption is thus 3 × 106m−1s−1. Compared with carbonic anhydrase, an extremely efficient enzyme that has a kcat/Km of 107-108m−1s−1 (27Lindskog S. Engberg P. Forsman C. Ibrahim S.A. Johnson B.H. Simonsson I. Tibell L. Ann. N. Y.

Allene-oxide synthase, a P450 acting as a dehydrase which converts lipid hydroperoxide to allene oxide, appears to form product at a rate of >60,000 mol/min/mol of protein (24Song W.C. Brash A.R. Science. 1991; 253: 781-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Nitric-oxide reductase, i.e.P450nor, which catalyzes NO to N2O has a turnover number of 72,000 mol/min/mol of protein (25Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, prostacyclin synthase, another non-classical P450 that uses PGH2 as the natural substrate, has a lower turnover number (∼150 mol/min/mol of protein) (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hara S. Miyata A. Yokoyama C. Inoue H. Brugger R. Lottspeich F. Ullrich V. Tanabe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19897-19903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TXAS, as observed in this study, formed MDA or TXA2 at a rate of 1,900 min−1. In other words, TXAS consumed PGH2 at a rate of 3,800 min−1. Furthermore, the ratio ofkcat/Km (an index of catalytic efficiency) of TXAS for PGH2 consumption is thus 3 × 106m−1s−1. Compared with carbonic anhydrase, an extremely efficient enzyme that has a kcat/Km of 107-108m−1s−1 (27Lindskog S. Engberg P. Forsman C. Ibrahim S.A. Johnson B.H. Simonsson I. Tibell L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1984; 429: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), TXAS should be considered as a very efficient catalyst. It should also be noted that many P450s including P450cam can act as non-classical P450s and convert PGH2 to MDA and HHT, but not TXA2, without reductase, molecular oxygen, or any electron donor (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their “HHT/MDA synthase” activities, nonetheless, are much lower than TXAS. A recent report showed that four microsomal P450s (P4501A2, 2B1, 2E1, and 3A4) had Kd for U44069 of ∼200 μm and when assayed at 50 μmPGH2, their catalytic activities were 1–10 min−1 (28Plastaras J.P. Guengerich P. Nebert D.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11784-11790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It would appear that PGH2 was readily converted to MDA and HHT by heme in the context of P450 where a hydrophobic environment is present. A study of chemical models for heme-catalyzed PGH2 reactions showed that 9% of HHT was formed in a phosphate buffer, whereas 33% of HHT was formed in acetonitrile, a less polar solvent (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TXAS is more efficient in HHT/MDA synthesis not only because its active site is hydrophobic but it also has a greater affinity for PGH2. Furthermore, several TXAS active site amino acid residues, as we have previously shown (29Wang L.-H. Matijevic-Aleksic N. Hsu P.-Y. Ruan K.-H. Wu K.K. Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19970-19975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), may be involved in the reaction. It is intriguing to note that prostacyclin synthase, although it has a high affinity for PGH2 (Kd is ∼10 μm), does not catalyze HHT/MDA formation (11Hecker M. Ullrich V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 141-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). What structural elements determine the HHT/MDA activity of P450 remains a challenging topic. In this study, the rate constant of each catalytic step,i.e. PGH2 to TXA2 or MDA/HHT, is estimated to be ∼15,000 s−1. The half-life of the intermediate(s) at 23 °C is therefore much less than the dead-time of the stopped-flow apparatus (∼1.5 ms). Furthermore, the rate constant of substrate binding is 12–20 × 106m−1 s−1 and the in vivo binding constant could be calculated if the cellular PGH2 concentration was known. To the best of our knowledge, cellular PGH2 concentration has not been reported due in part to the instability of PGH2 in aqueous solution. However, concentrations of arachidonic acid, the substrate for prostaglandin H synthase, in many inflammatory blood cells and lung tissues were less than 10 μm (30Triggiani M. Oriente A. Seeds M.C. Bass D.A. Marone G. Chilton F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1181-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In pancreatic islets, cellular un-esterified arachidonate concentrations of 38–75 μm were reported under glucose-induced conditions. But the maximally effective concentration, including exogenous arachidonic acid, was 30–40 μm (32Wolf B.A. Pasquale S.M. Turk J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6372-6379Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Since arachidonic acid is a substrate for many other pathways in addition to prostaglandin H synthase, it is probably safe to assume that the cellular PGH2 concentration is generally less than 40 μm. If that is the case, the substrate-binding rate constant for TXAS in the physiological conditions would be less than 800 s−1, and this value is much smaller than the other forward rate constants. We therefore conclude that the substrate-binding step is the rate-limiting step in the TXAS-catalyzed reaction. P450s were also classified according to the identity of their electron donors. Class I P450s require both ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase for electron transfer, whereas Class II P450s require only a P450 reductase (33Graham-Lorence S. Peterson J.A. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In both Class I and Class II P450s, the rate-limiting step of the overall reaction is at the stage of the second electron transfer to the heme center. Class III P450s that do not require any reductase, are not well characterized regarding their kinetic mechanisms. An elegant study on P450nor, a Class III P450, revealed that binding of NO and NADH substrates were fast to form the intermediate I, an NO-bound two-electron reduced species (25Shiro Y. Fujii M. Iizuka T. Adachi S. Tsukamoto K. Nakahara K. Shoun H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 270: 1617-1623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The intermediate I was slowly converted to the products. The rate-limiting step of P450nor is thus in the chemical steps. In contrast to other P450s, the rate-limiting step of TXAS is at the step of substrate binding. To the best of our knowledge, this kinetic mechanism is the first example of Class III P450s in which substrate binding is the rate-limiting step.

Kulmacz for valuable suggestions and helpful assistance in preparation and purification of PGH2."

Although various mechanisms exist to ensure that the majority of DNA damage is recognized and repaired and the integrity of the DNA is faithfully restored, some DNA lesions escape repair and persist in the cell. Unrepaired DNA lesions can block the progress of the replication machinery. To help resolve this problem, cells have specialized polymerases that carry out translesion DNA synthesis (TLS)1, which is a mechanism that permits nucleotides to be incorporated opposite lesions. After TLS bypasses the DNA damage, replication can continue with the normal replication machinery downstream of the site of the damage.Recently, a new family of DNA polymerases was identified called the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily (1Johnson R.E.

The lower fidelity enables these polymerases to carry out TLS and the lower processivity facilitates dissociation of these enzymes after bypass of a lesion; this is important because it allows the normal replication machinery, with high fidelity and processivity, to preferentially carry out DNA synthesis distal to the lesion.However, TLS is mutagenic when the base inserted opposite the DNA lesion is different than the base normally inserted opposite an undamaged base at that site. The chemical structure of the lesion is an important determinant for mutagenic or nonmutagenic bypass during TLS. Irradiation of DNA with UV light produces a variety of photoproducts that can cause mutations (16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 24-31Google Scholar). cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and (6-4)-photoproducts ((6–4)PP) are the two major classes of UV-induced DNA photoproducts. In DNA irradiated with UV, CPD is the most abundant lesion, and it is ∼3–5-fold more abundant than (6-4)PP. However, the mutagenic properties of these two lesions are different, and the relative contributions of the two lesions to the mutagenesis are not simply proportional to their relative abundance. The mutagenic specificities of CPD and (6-4)PP have been studied using well characterized site-specific UV photoproducts in DNA substrates. The mutation frequency obtained either with a site-specific TT-CPD or a TC-CPD is quite low (17Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Horsfall M.J. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in comparison, (6-4)PP is more mutagenic. The (6-4)PP at the 5′-TT site was highly mutagenic, and most of the mutations induced by this lesion are T to C transitions at the 3′-T (19LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9685-9689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, this type of mutation is not very common, because the (6-4)PP at the TT site is relatively rare. On the other hand, the TC-(6–4)PP is less mutagenic than the TT-(6–4)PP but more mutagenic than the TT-CPD. Of the mutations at this site, 80% were C to T transitions at the 3′ base (20Horsfall M.J. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since TC to TT is frequently observed in DNA exposed to UV and (6-4)PP forms most frequently in the TC sequence, the TC-(6–4)PP could be a candidate for a strongly premutagenic lesion.Human cells have three TLS polymerases that belong to the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily: polη (encoded by theXPV/RAD30A gene (21Masutani C Kusumoto R.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar, 23McDonald J.P. Rapic-Otrin V. Epstein J.A. Broughton B.C. Wang X. Lehmann A.R. Wolgemuth D.J. Woodgate R. Genomics. 1999; 60: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar)), and polκ (encoded by DINB1(24Ogi T. Kato Jr., T. Kato T. Ohmori H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 607-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)). In addition, the human protein hRev1 is a homologue of yeast REV1 (25Lin W. Xin H. Zhang Y. Wu X. Yuan F. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4468-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Polη, polι, and polκ bypass UV-induced damage with different efficiencies. Polη bypasses TT-CPD efficiently and inserts AA opposite the lesion; however, it adds only one base opposite the 3′-T of TT-(6–4)PP (5Masutani C. Araki M. Yamada A. Kusumoto R. Nogimori T. Maekawa T. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3491-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Polι bypasses TT-CPD and TT-(6–4)PP with low efficiency, adding one or a few bases opposite these lesions (26Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5259-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Polκ stops DNA synthesis and is blocked one base before TT-CPD and TT-(6–4)PP (9Ohashi E. Ogi T. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Ohmori H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1589-1594PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in human cells, none of these polymerases bypass (6-4)PP. In contrast, Escherichia coliDNA polymerase V (UmuD′2C (28Tang M. Shen X. Frank E.G. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8919-8924Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar)) efficiently bypasses both lesions, inserting AA or GA opposite TT-CPD or TT-(6–4)PP, respectively (8Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Thus, the chemical structure and the properties of each TLS polymerase determine which base is inserted and the likelihood of a mutation at a specific lesion.The goal of this work was to identify and characterize theDrosophila homologue(s) of the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily. Two cDNAs were isolated that encodeDrosophila Rad30A and Rad30B, called drad30A anddrad30B. Truncated forms of dRAD30A and dRAD30B proteins, designated dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC, respectively, have been purified, and their properties were studied, including the mechanism of UV-induced mutagenesis and the products of lesion bypass in reactions with these enzymes. The bypass templates used in this study include TC-(6–4)PP, TT-CPD, or TT-(6–4)PP; a template with TC-(6–4)PP was studied because of the biological relevance of this lesion. The results indicate that both polymerases bypass the TT-CPD in an error-free manner. Furthermore, dpolηΔC bypasses TT-(6–4)PP and TC-(6–4)PP in a highly error-prone manner.DISCUSSIONDamage-induced mutagenesis is an important biological process whose molecular mechanism is not yet understood and which is the subject of much current research. Recently, the proteins of the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily have been isolated and characterized biochemically, and it was shown that these proteins have a nonprocessive DNA polymerase activity that can bypass DNA lesions. Thus, these enzymes are central to the process of damage-induced mutagenesis. In this study, Drosophila homologues of this polymerase superfamily, dpolη and dpolι, were identified and characterized with respect to their ability to bypass UV-induced DNA lesions.Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human polη are considered to bypass TT-CPD in a mostly error-free manner (7Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3094-3099PubMed Google Scholar, 21Masutani C Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Similarly, dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC incorporate AA opposite TT-CPD more efficiently than other nucleotides (Fig. 4 A), and the elongation starts selectively from a primer ending in A opposite the lesion (Fig. 5, B and D). These results suggest that dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC bypass TT-CPD in a error-free manner as in the case of hpolη. In addition, direct analysis of the products of lesion bypass also indicates that dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC carry out error-free bypass of TT-CPD (Fig. 7). Thus, for these enzymes, TT-CPD maintains a structure that directs correct Watson-Crick base-pairing despite the base modification. In fact, Lawrence et al. (38Lawrence C.W. Banerjee S.K. Borden A. LeClerc J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) argue that the CPD must be an instructive lesion by virtue of its high coding specificity in E. coli, and structural studies show that the Watson-Crick base pair is still intact at the CPD site (39Kemmink J. Boelens R. Koning T. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Kaptein R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 11: 645-653Google Scholar, 40Taylor J.S. Garrett D.S. Brockie I.R. Svoboda D.L. Telser J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8858-8866Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 41Kim J.K. Patel D. Choi B.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, the TLS polymerases bypass this lesion by incorporating the correct bases on this instructional lesion.However, evidence also indicates that dpolηΔC does not carry out error-free bypass of (6-4)PP lesions. On templates with TT-(6–4)PP, dpolηΔC did not show selective elongation from the correct base paired primer/template (Figs. 6 A). Furthermore, the bypass products of TT-(6–4)PP by dpolηΔC showed high levels of misincorporation (Fig. 7 B). dpolηΔC elongated DNA efficiently from the 17-mer end with a mismatched G opposite the 3′-T of TT-(6–4)PP (Fig. 6 A) and preferentially from the 18-mer with GA opposite the lesion (Fig. 6 C). The favored elongation from the mismatched GA/TT-(6–4)PP terminus is consistent with structural studies. An NMR study of a duplex DNA with (6-4)PP revealed that TT-(6–4)PP greatly distorts the DNA structure and prevents base-pairing with A in the complementary strand (41Kim J.K. Patel D. Choi B.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, a mismatched base pair between the 3′-T of TT-(6–4)PP and G forms hydrogen bonds and stabilizes the helix (42Fujiwara Y. Iwai S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 43Jing Y. Kao J.F. Taylor J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3845-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the G/T mispair at the 3′-T of TT (6-4)PP retains the normal Watson-Crick-type base-pairing between the 5′-T of the TT-(6–4)PP and an opposed A, and the resultant GA/TT-(6–4)PP duplex can assume the typical B-form-DNA conformation (44Lee J.H. Hwang G.S. Choi B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6632-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our results also fit well with the specificity of base alteration of UV-induced mutations in which a G residue is preferentially inserted opposite the 3′-T of the 6–4-photoproduct during TLS in E. coli (19LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9685-9689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the TT-(6–4) photoproduct can be classified as a mis-instructional lesion.Despite the biological relevance of this DNA lesion, the tertiary structures of oligonucleotide duplexes, which include TC-(6–4)PP, have not been well characterized. Fujiwara and Iwai (42Fujiwara Y. Iwai S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) show that the duplex containing G opposite the 3′-C of TC-(6–4)PP is thermodynamically more stable than another duplex (42Fujiwara Y. Iwai S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1544-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Horsfall and Lawrence (20Horsfall M.J. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) studied the mutagenicity of TC-(6–4)PP in E. coli cells and found that 66% of the bypass products have the correct TC sequence, 28% of the mutants having the TT sequence (20Horsfall M.J. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Our observation that both G and A are incorporated opposite the 3′-C of TC-(6–4)PP (Fig. 4 B) fit well with these results. On the other hand, the nucleotide incorporated opposite the 5′-T of TC-(6–4)PP is not consistent with the mutation spectrum. Although thein vivo mutation spectrum indicates that A is incorporated preferentially opposite the 5′-T of TC-(6–4)PP, our in vitro results indicated that dpolηΔC elongated the DNA chain equally well from the 18-mer primer with A or G opposite the 5′-T (data not shown). It will be necessary to determine the sequence of the bypass products directly or perform steady-state kinetics to clarify this point.The mutagenic properties of dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC fit well with the mutation spectrum obtained using a defined photoproduct introduced into SOS-induced E. coli (19LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9685-9689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38Lawrence C.W. Banerjee S.K. Borden A. LeClerc J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 222: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutation spectrum reported in those studies reflects the mutagenic properties of pol V (UmuD·2C complex). Thus, the mutagenic properties of dpolηΔC on TT-CPD and TT-(6–4)PP are very similar to those of pol V. Both enzymes bypass TT-CPD in an error-free manner and incorporate GA opposite TT-(6–4)PP cells (Ref. 8Tang M. Pham P. Shen X. Taylor J.S. O'Donnell M. Woodgate R. Goodman M.F. Nature. 2000; 404: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar and this study). The similarity in the nucleotides incorporated suggests that structural information in the altered bases contribute to nucleotide selection during incorporation opposite these lesions by these polymerases.In the Rad30 protein family, dpolηΔC seems to be an unusual member of the Rad30 family in having the ability to bypass (6-4)PP, although we cannot rule out a possibility that having an N-terminal GST tag and a C-terminal truncation have affected the TLS specificity and activity; we also have to keep in mind that we cannot draw a quantitatively definitive conclusion since the observations present in this study are qualitative. It should also be noted that the DNA repair capacity ofDrosophila cells is somewhat different from that of human cells. The most striking difference is that Drosophila cells have a 6–4-photolyase, which specifically repairs (6-4)PP in a light-dependent manner, but human cells lack this enzyme (45Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T. Nature. 1993; 361: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The (6-4)PP lesions are removed rapidly by nucleotide excision repair. However, a small amount of the lesion might remain that would be toxic because (6-4)PP is highly mutagenic. The remaining (6-4)PP lesions can be removed by the 6–4-photolyase in Drosophilacells, and thus, the error-prone bypass activity of dpolη might not be so deleterious. On the other hand, human cells lack the 6–4-photolyase, and thus, more lesions might remain, so that error-prone bypass of this lesion would have a deleterious effect. Thus, hpolη might have lost the ability to bypass (6-4)PP because that loss enhances genetic stability. Paradoxically, we have recently shown that in human cells, mutations are produced at the (6-4)PP site, although the frequency is low (46Otoshi E. Yagi T. Mori T. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Kim S.T. Hitomi K. Ikenaga M. Todo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1729-1735PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in human cells, some DNA polymerases bypass the (6-4)PP in an error-prone manner. Another enzyme, for example hpolι, might bypass (6-4)PP in vivo, in conjunction with polζ (27Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar).In this study, TT (6-4)PP was bypassed by dpolηΔC but not by dpolιΔC. The TLS activity of dpolηΔC and dpolιΔC was also examined on chemically modified damage, and all of the other lesions tested were bypassed by both enzymes (data not shown). Thus, at present we cannot assign any specific biological function to dpolι. Further analyses of the substrate specificity of these polymerases by screening various types of DNA lesions may reveal differences in their substrate specificity. Another possibility is that each polymerase interacts with other protein differently in vivo. The recombinant protein used in this study has a C-terminal deletion. The deleted C-terminal portion might have an important biological interaction with other proteins in vivo, whereas it is not required for polymerase activity in vitro. It is also possible that dpolη and dpolι have different in vivo functions inDrosophila that have not been detected by in vitro studies carried out to date. One enzyme may be important for the defense against DNA damage, and another may be involved in some biological process that requires DNA replication on a primer-template complex containing an unusual mismatch. Detailed analyses of the expression pattern of each gene at the tissue and cellular levels will provide clues to the function of each gene. Furthermore, the phenotypes of transgenic flies that overexpress these genes and mutant flies in which each gene is disrupted by an insertion or repressed by RNA interference (RNAi) will clarify the biological roles of these proteins in Drosophila. DNA is frequently damaged by environmental and endogenous genotoxic agents. Although various mechanisms exist to ensure that the majority of DNA damage is recognized and repaired and the integrity of the DNA is faithfully restored, some DNA lesions escape repair and persist in the cell. Unrepaired DNA lesions can block the progress of the replication machinery. To help resolve this problem, cells have specialized polymerases that carry out translesion DNA synthesis (TLS)1, which is a mechanism that permits nucleotides to be incorporated opposite lesions. After TLS bypasses the DNA damage, replication can continue with the normal replication machinery downstream of the site of the damage. Recently, a new family of DNA polymerases was identified called the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily (1Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar,12Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 3094-3099PubMed Google Scholar). The lower fidelity enables these polymerases to carry out TLS and the lower processivity facilitates dissociation of these enzymes after bypass of a lesion; this is important because it allows the normal replication machinery, with high fidelity and processivity, to preferentially carry out DNA synthesis distal to the lesion. However, TLS is mutagenic when the base inserted opposite the DNA lesion is different than the base normally inserted opposite an undamaged base at that site. The chemical structure of the lesion is an important determinant for mutagenic or nonmutagenic bypass during TLS. Irradiation of DNA with UV light produces a variety of photoproducts that can cause mutations (16Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 24-31Google Scholar). cis-syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) and (6-4)-photoproducts ((6–4)PP) are the two major classes of UV-induced DNA photoproducts. In DNA irradiated with UV, CPD is the most abundant lesion, and it is ∼3–5-fold more abundant than (6-4)PP. However, the mutagenic properties of these two lesions are different, and the relative contributions of the two lesions to the mutagenesis are not simply proportional to their relative abundance. The mutagenic specificities of CPD and (6-4)PP have been studied using well characterized site-specific UV photoproducts in DNA substrates. The mutation frequency obtained either with a site-specific TT-CPD or a TC-CPD is quite low (17Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 18Horsfall M.J. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in comparison, (6-4)PP is more mutagenic. The (6-4)PP at the 5′-TT site was highly mutagenic, and most of the mutations induced by this lesion are T to C transitions at the 3′-T (19LeClerc J.E. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9685-9689Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, this type of mutation is not very common, because the (6-4)PP at the TT site is relatively rare. On the other hand, the TC-(6–4)PP is less mutagenic than the TT-(6–4)PP but more mutagenic than the TT-CPD. Of the mutations at this site, 80% were C to T transitions at the 3′ base (20Horsfall M.J. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since TC to TT is frequently observed in DNA exposed to UV and (6-4)PP forms most frequently in the TC sequence, the TC-(6–4)PP could be a candidate for a strongly premutagenic lesion. Human cells have three TLS polymerases that belong to the UmuC/DinB/Rev1/Rad30 superfamily: polη (encoded by theXPV/RAD30A gene (21Masutani C Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M.

https://openalex.org/W2032185650,"A structural and thermodynamic study of the entropic contribution of salt bridge formation to the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and the variable domain fragment (Fv) of anti-HEL antibody, HyHEL-10, was carried out. Three Fv mutants (HD32A, HD96A, and HD32AD96A) were prepared, and the interactions between the mutant Fvs and HEL were investigated. Crystallography revealed that the overall structures of these mutant complexes were almost identical to that of wild-type Fv. Little structural changes were observed in the HD32AD96A mutant-HEL complex, and two water molecules were introduced into the mutation site, indicating that the two water molecules structurally compensated for the complete removal of the salt bridges. This result suggests that the entropic contribution of the salt bridge originates from dehydration. In the singly mutated complexes, one water molecule was also introduced into the mutated site, bridging the antigen-antibody interface. However, a local structural difference was observed in the HD32A Fv-HEL complex, and conformational changes occurred due to changes in the relative orientation of the heavy chain to the light chain upon complexation in HD96A Fv-HEL complexes. The reduced affinity of these single mutants for the antigen originates from the increase in entropy loss, indicating that these structural changes also introduced an increase in entropy loss. These results suggest that salt bridge formation makes an entropic contribution to the protein antigen-antibody interaction through reduction of entropy loss due to dehydration and structural changes.1IC41IC51IC7 A structural and thermodynamic study of the entropic contribution of salt bridge formation to the interaction between hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) and the variable domain fragment (Fv) of anti-HEL antibody, HyHEL-10, was carried out.

Immunol. 1993; 5: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) suggest that the strict specificity of an antibody originates from a high degree of complementarity between the antigen-combining sites and the antigen. The complementarity is composed of two factors: 1) apolar surfaces interacting by van der Waals contact, where the surfaces of the antibody and antigen often fit together to exclude most hydrated water molecules from the interface and favorable close van der Waals contacts are formed; and 2) polar surfaces interacting by hydrogen bond and salt bridge formation, where the precise positioning of atoms allows charge-charge interactions (i.e. salt bridge formation and hydrogen bond formation). To elucidate the roles of the noncovalent forces involved in antigen-antibody complementary association, both structural and thermodynamic information are crucial (7Webster D.M. Henry A.H. Rees A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 123-129Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar). X-ray crystal analysis can clarify the structural aspects for the complementarity of the interactions (2Davies D.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The combination of thermodynamic data with structural results should be powerful for the precise description of the mutant Fv-HEL interactions. The role of salt bridge formation in antigen-antibody interaction is particularly important since electrostatic complementarity is critical for high specificity and affinity of protein antigen-antibody interactions (2Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 3Colman P.M. Adv.

Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis of protein-protein complexes have demonstrated that, in the majority of cases, mutations of polar and charged residues result in complex destabilization (23Scheinerman F.B. Norel R. Honig B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 24Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Two salt bridges have been observed in the Fv-HEL complex; Lys97 of HEL electrostatically interacts with both Asp32 and Asp96 of HyHEL-10 VH (Fig.1). We recently reported the role of salt bridge formation in the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex from the thermodynamic viewpoint (21Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32612-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We replaced Asp32 in VH with Ala, Asn, and Glu and observed increases in both negative enthalpy and entropy changes. We concluded that salt bridge formation makes an entropic contribution to the interaction. Thus, structural analyses of mutant Fv-HEL complexes should give further insights into the molecular basis for the entropic contribution of the salt bridge to the interaction. Here, using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography, we report the effect of deleting antibody side chains participating in salt bridge formation on the complex formation. Moreover, we discuss, from the structural viewpoint, the molecular basis for the entropic contribution of the salt bridge to the protein antigen-antibody interaction. The general recombinant DNA technology was essentially that of Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch F.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with phagemid pTZ18U (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan) according to the method of Kunkel (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The DNA oligonucleotides for mutation at sites 32 and 96 of VH were 5′-ATCACCTCGGCCTACTGGTCG-3′ and 5′-GCGAACTGGGCCGGCGACTAC-3′, respectively (mutated sites are underlined). Correctness of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an Auto-Read sequencing kit and an ALF express sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). The mutant Fv fragment was prepared essentially as described previously (17Merk H. Stiege W. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Erdmann V.A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purified Fv fragment was concentrated by ultrafiltration centrifugation (0.45-μm membrane) at 3000 × g (Centriprep-10). The antigen, HEL (Seikagaku-Kogyo Inc., Tokyo, Japan), was purified on SP-Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by gel filtration on 75 pg of Superdex equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. Purities of the proteins were confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the buffer system described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The eluate was lyophilized and dissolved in water at a concentration of 0.54 mm prior to use. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra in the near- and far-UV regions were obtained with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a water bath to control the temperature at 25 °C. The concentration of antibody fragments was 0.1 mg/ml for the near- and far-UV experiments. Sixteen scans were averaged to obtain the spectrum. Cells with path lengths of 1 and 0.1 mm were used for near- and far-UV data acquisition, respectively. Experimental procedure for inhibition assay has been in principle followed by Uedaet al. (17Merk H. Stiege W. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Erdmann V.A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, the various concentrations of the Fv fragment were mixed with 1.5 μm HEL and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h in 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Each mixture was then added to 970 μl of 50 mmNaH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.20, adjusted with NaOH) containing 340 μg of Micrococcus luteus cells. The initial rate of the decrease in A540 nm was monitored at 25 °C. Thermodynamic parameters of the interactions between HEL and the wild-type or mutant Fv fragments were determined by isothermal microtitration calorimetry using an Omega titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). The experimental conditions were as follows. In a calorimeter cell, the Fv fragment at a concentration of 5 μm in 50 mmphosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 200 mm NaCl was titrated with a 125 μm solution of HEL in the same buffer at four different temperatures (25 °C, 30 °C, 35 °C, and 40 °C). The ligand solution was injected 16 times in portions of 7 μl over 15 s. Thermogram data were analyzed with the computer program Origin (MicroCal, Inc.). The enthalpy change (ΔH) and binding constant (Ka ) on antigen-antibody interaction were directly obtained from the experimental titration curve. The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG = −RT lnKa ) and the entropy change (ΔS= (−ΔG + ΔH)/T) on the association were calculated from ΔH andKa . The heat capacity change (ΔCp ) was estimated from the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change. The concentration of HEL was estimated using A2801% = 26.5 (29Imoto T. Johnson T.M. North A.C.T. Phillips D.C. Rupley J.A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 665-868Google Scholar), and the concentration of each mutant HyHEL-10 Fv fragment was estimated using A2801% = 20.6 (17Merk H. Stiege W. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Erdmann V.A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The HyHEL-10 mutant Fv fragment-HEL complexes were crystallized as described previously (22Kondo H.

The best crystals of the Fv-HEL complex were grown from 100 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.6–7.8), 9–11% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000, and 7–9% w/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. They were elongated bipyramid-shaped crystals. All crystallographic data were collected on a DIP-2000 diffractometer (MAC Science, Yokohama, Japan) with a 200-mm diameter imaging plate (CuKα radiation; 50 kV, 90 mA). The diffraction images were integrated with the hkl program DENZO,2 and the intensity data were processed with SCALA, 2Unpublished data. and AGROVATA (32Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, Acta Crystallogr.

Open table in a new tab The crystals of these three mutant Fv-HEL complexes were isomorphous with that of wild-type complex. The structure of HEL-Fv was determined by a molecular replacement method with the program AMoRe (34Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 805-812Crossref Google Scholar) in the CCP4 package. The model coordinates of the mutant complexes were derived from the wild-type complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 1c08). Refinements of the structure of the Fv-HEL complex were carried out with the programs XPLOR (35Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (36Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The atomic parameters of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (codes1IC4, 1IC5, and 1IC7 for HD32A, HD96A, and HD32AD96A, respectively). To elucidate the structural and thermodynamic effects of deleting salt bridges in the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex, we constructed two new mutants (HD96A and HD32AD96A). These new mutants and the HD32A mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the mutant Fv fragments were purified by affinity chromatography using HEL-Sepharose, followed by gel filtration on 75 pg of Superdex. Purities of greater than 95% were obtained with these steps, and the purified Fv fragments were subjected to precise analysis. The final yield of each mutant was greater than 10 mg/liter of culture. To examine the effect of mutation on the conformational stability, we measured the peptide and aromatic CD spectra of the mutants under the native condition (pH 7.2, 25 °C). Comparison of these CD spectra with those of the WT revealed no differences in the far- and near-UV CD spectra of wild-type Fv and mutant Fv fragments (data not shown). The overall CD spectra of three mutants were almost identical to the CD spectrum of WT, indicating that the secondary and tertiary structures of the mutants are quite similar to the structure of WT. Thus, the mutations have no significant influence on the overall structure. It has been shown that the HyHEL-10 Fv fragment inhibits the enzymatic activity of its antigen, HEL, in the presence of a slight molar excess of the Fv fragment, resulting from the binding of the Fv to the active site of HEL (17Merk H. Stiege W. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Erdmann V.A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HEL by three mutants (HD32A, HD96A, and HD32AD96A) was investigated (Fig. 2). In comparison with wild-type Fv, these clones showed decreased inhibition toward HEL to different degrees. The HD32AD96A mutant Fv exhibited the largest degree of decreased inhibition of HEL enzymatic activity, suggesting that deleting both side chains resulted in a significant reduction of affinity for HEL. The mutant Fv-HEL complexes were superimposed onto the wild-type Fv-HEL complex. The root-mean-square differences between the Cα atoms of the mutant Fv structures and those of the wild-type Fv are summarized in Table III. The results demonstrated that the overall structures of the HyHEL-10 mutant Fv-HEL complexes are similar to that of the HyHEL-10 wild-type Fv-HEL complex (TableIII).Table IIIRoot mean square differences in the Cα atom of each chain (Å)MutantVL fitVH fitHEL fitFv fitAll fitHD32AVL0.150.290.250.200.17VH0.330.300.520.330.29HEL0.290.570.150.390.19HD96AVL0.170.490.800.210.25VH0.360.200.600.260.29HEL0.700.610.180.580.34HD32AD96AVL0.110.250.180.150.14VH0.280.130.350.180.18HEL0.130.180.100.180.12The root mean square differences were obtained by superposing the Cα coordinates of each chain (VL, VH, or HEL) with those of the corresponding chain of the wild-type Fv. In the right column, the Cα coordinates of all chains in the mutant Fv-HEL complex were used for superposing with those in the wild-type Fv-HEL complex. Open table in a new tab The root mean square differences were obtained by superposing the Cα coordinates of each chain (VL, VH, or HEL) with those of the corresponding chain of the wild-type Fv. In the right column, the Cα coordinates of all chains in the mutant Fv-HEL complex were used for superposing with those in the wild-type Fv-HEL complex. No major changes in the relative orientations of VL, VH, and HEL were observed in the HD32A mutant Fv-HEL and HD32AD96A-HEL complexes. However, superimposition of the Cα coordinates of Fv (VL and VH) of the HyHEL-10 HD96A mutant complex onto those of the wild-type Fv complex yielded root-mean-square differences of 0.21 for VL, 0.26 for VH, and 0.58 for HEL. These root-mean-square differences originated from the different relative orientations of Fv to HEL in the HD96A mutant complex and the wild-type complex (Fig.5). The calculated interfacial areas of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes were 1715, 1729, and 1722 Å2 for the HD32A, HD96A, and HD32AD96A mutant complexes, respectively (TableIV); these values were about 100 Å2 smaller than the value for the wild-type Fv (1835 Å2). The most significant decreases in the areas, >20 Å2, were in Asn19, Arg73, and Asn77 of HEL.Table IVInterfacial areas of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes (Å2)ComplexVLVHHELPolarApolarAllÅ2Wild type35551396710427931835HD32A337 (−18)495 (−18)883 (−84)9437721715 (−120)HD96A341 (−14)477 (−36)921 (−46)9377911729 (−106)HD32AD96A334 (−21)486 (−27)902 (−65)9178041722 (−113)Interfacial areas were calculated with the program NACCESS (39Hubbard S.J.

Although little structural change occurred in the antigen HEL in the HD32A Fv-HEL complex, a structural difference was observed in the complementarity-determining region 1 in the heavy chain (CDR-H1) (Fig. 6). One water molecule (W33) was introduced into the mutation site, bridging Lys97 of HEL with the main chain of CDR-H1 (Fig.6 A). Tyr53 in CDR-H2 penetrated into the antigen, making more van der Waals contacts with HEL (Fig.6B). In addition, one water molecule (W2) formed a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of HTyr53, bridging the loop of the lysozyme with the antibody. These observations suggest that deletion of the carboxyl group at site 32 in VH led to the local structural changes of the antibody in the complex. No structural changes were observed in the Fv of the HD96A Fv-HEL complex, except at the mutated site. One water molecule was introduced into the mutation site (W15, Fig. 7), bridging HAsp32 and HAla96 with HAsn94, and Lys97 of HEL, respectively. The structural change of the CDR-H3 and the change of the relative orientation of Fv to HEL occurred, resulting from the deposition of the water molecule. These results suggest that the effect of deleting the Asp96 side chain in VH is compensated for by introducing one water molecule and the change of relative orientation of each chain. In contrast to the HD32A Fv-HEL and HD96A Fv-HEL mutant complexes, there were few structural changes in both the antigen and antibody of the HD32AD96A mutant Fv-HEL complex. One water molecule (W4) was located in the mutated site and formed two hydrogen bonds, filling a local structurally imperfect complementarity (Fig. 8 A). In addition, one water molecule (W123) was retained in the interface, participating in hydrogen-bonding networks in the antigen-antibody interface (Fig. 8 B). We recently reported the entropic contribution of salt bridge formation to the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL interaction (21Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32612-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To obtain the structural basis for the contribution to the interaction, two mutants (HD96A and HD32AD96A) were newly constructed, and the interactions of these two mutants and a third mutant (HD32A) with HEL were investigated by thermodynamic and structural analyses. As shown previously (15Ueda Y. Tsumoto K. Watanabe K. Kumagai I. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 129: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Chacko S. Silverton E. Kam-Morgan L. Smith-Gill S. Cohen G. Davies D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and in the present study, each mutation does not lead to major structural changes in the Fv fragment, and the stability of each mutant is almost identical to that of wild-type Fv. Thus, the structural and thermodynamic changes in the antigen-antibody complexes by mutation do not originate from changes in the structure of the mutants in the antigen-free state. In the following subsections, we discuss and correlate our thermodynamic and structural findings. The values for both the enthalpic (−ΔH) and entropic (−TΔS) contributions to the interaction between the mutants and HEL became increasingly negative in the order HD32A < HD96A < HD32AD96A. The binding constants (Ka) were decreased slightly in two mutants (HD32A and HD96A) and significantly in one mutant (HD32A96A), resulting in a smaller change in the Gibbs energy (−ΔG). These results indicate that deletion of salt bridges in the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex is enthalpically favorable and entropically unfavorable, suggesting that the salt bridges in the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL interaction make an entropic contribution to the interaction. Substitution of Asp32 with other residues (e.g. Asn and Glu) also led to increases in both negative enthalpy and entropy changes (21Tsumoto K. Ogasahara K. Ueda Y. Watanabe K. Yutani K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32612-32616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is almost identical to the results reported here. Thus, we conclude that the salt bridges in the HyHEL-10-HEL complex make an entropic contribution to the interaction. Precise analyses of another protein antigen-antibody interaction, namely the HyHEL-5-HEL interaction, demonstrated that salt bridge formation made a significant contribution to the interaction (42Chacko S. Silverton E. Kam-Morgan L. Smith-Gill S. Cohen G. Davies D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 43Wibbenmeyer J.A. Schuck P. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. J.

J. 1998; 74: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The salt bridge formed in an environment of low dielectric constant and, thus, the contribution of the salt link may be highly enthalpic (43Wibbenmeyer J.A. Schuck P. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26838-26842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Xavier K.A. Smith-Gill S.J. Willson R.C. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an entropic contribution of the salt bridge was indicated in the HyHEL-10-HEL interaction. To correlate the results obtained from thermodynamic analyses with structural information, the crystal structures of mutant Fv-HEL complexes were solved. We now discuss the role of salt bridge formation in the HyHEL-10-HEL interaction on the basis of structural information. Mutations did not affect the crystal packing. Thus, the local structural changes due to the mutations, including interface solvents, can be discussed directly by comparison of the mutant structures with the wild-type structure. The overall structures of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes are similar to that of the wild-type Fv-HEL complex (Fig. 5). However, the area of HEL covered by mutant Fvs decreased by 46–84 Å2 in comparison with the wild-type Fv-HEL complex, indicating a decrease in burial of surface areas by mutation. The changes in thermodynamic parameters can be accounted for in terms of changes in solvent-accessible polar and apolar surface area (1Janin J. Chothia C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16027-16030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol.

Thus, the Gibbs energy changes of the mutant Fv-HEL interactions have been estimated based on the polar and apolar buried surface areas of the crystal structures. On comparison of all mutant Fv fragments with the wild-type Fv, the calculated negative values of the Gibbs energy change for the mutant-HEL interactions were decreased by 9.2, 8.6, and 10.0 kJ mol−1 for HD32A, HD96A, and HD32AD96A, respectively, at 30 °C. These values indicate that the degree of reduction of the changes in polar and apolar surface areas does not correspond to that of the decrease in affinity for the antigen determined by experiments (Table II), suggesting the compensation by other non-covalent bond formations.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of the interactions between mutant Fv and HEL at 30 °C and pH 7.2MutantnKaΔGΔΔGΔHΔΔHΔSΔΔSΔCpΔΔCp× 108 m−1kJ mol−1kJ mol−1 K−1Wild type1.04.2−50.20−91.50−0.1370−1.40HD32A1.01.0−46.43.8−112.9−21.3−0.219−0.082−1.8−0.4HD96A1.02.1−48.22.1−113.7−22.3−0.216−0.079−1.9−0.5HD32A96A1.00.4−44.16.0−114.2−22.7−0.231−0.094−2.1−0.7Experimental protocols are described under “Materials and Methods.” Each value is the average of at least three independent measurements.

The changes in the interaction between the double mutant (HD32AD96A) and HEL reflect the complete deletion of salt bridges in the HyHEL-10-HEL complex. Double mutation led to an order of magnitude decrease in affinity (Table II), suggesting that recognition of the amino group in Lys97 by Asp residues made a positive contribution to the interaction. Little changes, including the relative orientation of three chains and local loop structures, were observed in the double-mutant complex. Two water molecules (Fig. 8, W4and W123) were introduced into the mutated sites. These two water molecules bridge the antigen-antibody interface by hydrogen bonding (Fig. 8). These results indicate that structural compensation by water molecules leads to the increase in negative values of ΔCp and ΔH, suggesting that the salt bridges make an entropic contribution through complete dehydration. The negative values of heat capacity change (ΔCp ) calculated for each mutant complex increased by 0.4–0.7 kJ K−1 mol−1 in comparison with the wild-type value (Table II, Fig. 3). A negative ΔCp has been proposed to be a consequence of an increase in hydrophobic interaction (50Sturtevant J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A recent report of the interaction between mutant DNA gyrase and the antibiotic novobiocin proposed that the negative values of ΔCp increase by ∼200 ± 130 J K−1 mol−1per interfacial water molecule (1 cal = 4.18 J) (52Holdgate G.A. Tunnicliffe A. Ward W.H.J. Weston S.A. Rosenbrock G. Barth P.T. Taylor I.W.F. Pauptit R.A. Timms D. Biochemistry. 1997; 63: 9663-9673Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The increases in negative values of ΔCp , ΔH, and ΔS may originate from refilling water molecules in the interface. On the other hand, in the HD32A and HD96A mutant complexes, at least one water molecule was newly retained at the mutated site, and structural changes (e.g. changes in the relative orientation of the variable domains and local loop structure) were observed. The side chain at site 32 of VH is almost buried (the calculated accessible surface area is 3 Å2) in the complex. An Asp32 → Ala mutation resulted in refilling one water molecule at the mutated site in the mutant Fv-HEL complex (Fig. 6). The water molecule makes two hydrogen bonds with the side chain of HEL Lys97 and the main chain of the H chain Ala32, bridging HEL with the Fv. In addition, the mutation led to structural changes in CDR-H1, suggesting that structural changes in the loop were introduced into CDR-H1 by substitution of Asp32 with Ala. These results indicate that deleting the side chain at site 32 of VH is compensated for by one water molecule and local structural changes in the CDR-H1 loop. It has been suggested that the unfavorable entropy change results in part from reduction of conformational flexibility in the antibody upon complexation (55Wilcox B.E. Gao G.F. Wyer J.R. Ladbury J.E. Bell J.I. Jakobsen B.K. van der Merwe P.A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,56Murphy K.P. Freire E. Paterson Y. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 21: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Replacement of Asp96 with Ala resulted in refilling one water molecule at the mutated site in the mutant Fv-HEL complex. The water molecule makes hydrogen bonds with Lys97 of HEL and HAsp32, HAsn94, and HAla96 of Fv, bridging HEL with the Fv. There were no significant changes in the main chains of the polypeptides (i.e. VH, VL, and HEL). The side chain at site 96 of VH is highly exposed (the calculated accessible surface area is 34 Å2). In addition, the relative orientation of VH to VL was changed by the mutation at site 96 of VH (Table III). These results suggest that one water molecule and structural changes (i.e. changes in the relative orientations of the chains) compensate for deleting the side chain at site 96 of VH. It has been indicated that the changes in the relative orientations of the chains reflected the induced fitting of the Fv to the protein antigen (57Bhat T.N. Bentley G.A. Fischmann T.O. Boulot G. Poljak R.J. Nature. 1990; 347: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The results reported here might suggest that removal of the side chain of Asp96 in VH HyHEL-10 Fv require the excess induced fitting for the recognition of the antigen. It should be noted that the values of ΔH of the interaction between each of the single mutants (HD32A and HD96A) and HEL are almost the same as that of the HD32AD96A mutant (Table II). Moreover, the difference in affinity between each of the single mutants and the HD32AD96A mutant originates from the entropy change. Structural analyses have indicated that both a refilling water molecule and structural changes may lead to an increase in negative entropy change. Therefore, an additional decrease in negative entropy change might be required for further enhancement of the antibody affinity for the antigen. Introducing two Asp residues in the antibody reduces the entropy loss upon binding of the antibody to the antigen. These results suggest that the salt bridge makes an entropic contribution to the interaction through a decrease in entropy loss due to dehydration and structural changes. Salt bridge formation is a major contributor to various biomolecular interactions (17Merk H. Stiege W. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. Erdmann V.A. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 125: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 58Davies S.J. Davies E.A. Tucknott M.G. Jones E.Y. van der Merwe P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The salt bridges in the HyHEL-10-HEL complex, as shown here, are buried (Asp32-Lys97) and partially buried (Asp96-Lys97); deletion of these salt bridges led to structural compensation, including refilling water molecules. We conclude that salt bridge formation makes an entropic contribution to the interaction through a decrease in entropy loss due to dehydration and structural changes."

To identify genes that share an essential function with calcineurin, we screened for mutations that confer sensitivity to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 and high temperature and isolated the mutant its8-1. its8+ encodes a homolog of the budding yeast MCD4 and human Pig-n that are involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor synthesis. Consistently, reduced inositol labeling of proteins suggested impaired GPI anchor synthesis in its8-1 mutants. The temperature upshift induced a further decrease in inositol labeling and caused dramatic increases in the frequency of septation in its8-1mutants. BE49385A, an inhibitor of MCD4 and Pig-n, also increased the septation index of the wild-type cell. Osmotic stabilization suppressed these morphological defects, indicating that cell wall weakness caused by impaired GPI anchor synthesis resulted in abnormal cytokinesis. Furthermore, calcineurin-deleted cells exhibited hypersensitivity to BE49385A, and FK506 exacerbated the cytokinesis defects of the its8-1 mutant. Thus, calcineurin and Its8 may share an essential function in cytokinesis and cell viability through the regulation of cell wall integrity.

In eukaryotic cells, various proteins are attached to the external leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1 anchor (1McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A. Biochem.

Cells synthesize the GPI anchor carbohydrate core in the ER by successively adding N-acetylglucosamine, three mannoses, and EtNP onto phosphatidylinositol, thus forming the complete GPI precursor lipid, which is then added to proteins. This core is conserved in all eukaryotes but is modified by various side chains in different organisms. In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Sutterlin C. Escribano M.V. Gerold P. Maeda Y.

It has been suggested that Pig-n and Mcd4 are involved in this modification in mammalian and budding yeast cells, respectively (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H.

MCD4 is essential for growth of S. cerevisiae, and its temperature-sensitive mutant does not generate functional GPI at restrictive temperatures (9Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I.

On the other hand, modification of the Man1 by EtNP, mediated by Pig-n, is not essential for attachment of GPI anchors in mammalian cells (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M.

Thus, BE49385A may be useful for selectively inhibiting the generation of GPI-anchored protein in yeast and other fungi. Calcineurin, a Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, is a molecular target for specific immunosuppressive drugs such as CsA or FK506 used in organ transplantation (11Liu J.

We have studied calcineurin signal transduction pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because this system is amenable to genetic studies and has advantages such as relevance to higher systems. In addition, S. pombe is an excellent model organism in which to study cell division, because it shows the general features of higher eukaryotic cell division. S. pombe has a single gene encoding the catalytic subunit of calcineurin,ppb1+, which is essential for cytokinesis (14Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Plochocka Z.D. Rasmussen G. Rasmussen C. J. Biol.

We have previously shown that ppb1+ plays an essential role in maintaining chloride ion homeostasis and acts antagonistically with the Pmk1 MAPK pathway (16Sugiura R. Toda T. Shuntoh H. Yanagida M.

To identify gene products sharing an essential function with calcineurin, we have developed a genetic screen using the immunosuppressive drug FK506 for mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth and have identified eight complementation groups (its1-8 forimmunosuppressant andtemperature-sensitive, to be described elsewhere in detail). Here we report that its8+ encodes a fission yeast homolog of Mcd4 and Pig-n. Analyses of an immunosuppressant- and temperature-sensitive mutant its8-1, and pharmacological experiments using BE49385A and FK506 revealed that Its8, a GPI anchor-synthesizing protein, and calcineurin appear to share an essential function in cytokinesis and cell viability through the regulation of cell wall integrity. Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The complete medium, YPD, and minimal medium, EMM, have been described previously (18Toda T. Dhut S. Superti F.G. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Sugiura R. Kuno T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6752-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Adenine sulfate (20 μg/ml) was added to YPD when adenine auxotrophs were cultured. FK506 was provided by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan), and BE49385A was provided by Banyu Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Standard methods for S. pombe genetics were followed according to Moreno et al. (19Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P.

Also, gene disruptions are abbreviated by the gene preceded by Δ (for example, Δits8). Proteins are denoted by roman letters and only the first letter is capitalized (for example, Its8). The its8-1 mutant was isolated in a screen of cells that had been mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Cells of strain HM123 were mutagenized with 300 μm nitrosoguanidine (Sigma) for 60 min (∼10% survival) as described by Moreno et al. (19Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Mutants were spread onto YPD plates to give ∼1,000 cells/plate and were incubated at 27 °C for 4 days. The plates were then replica-plated to 36 °C and to plates containing 0.5 μg/ml FK506. Mutants that showed both temperature sensitivity and FK506 sensitivity were selected. The original mutants isolated were backcrossed three times to wild-type strain HM123 and HM528. To clone the its8+ gene, the its8-1 mutant (KP533) was grown at 27 °C and transformed with an S. pombe genomic DNA library constructed in the vector pDB248 (19Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Leu+ transformants were replica-plated to 36 °C, and plasmid DNA was recovered from 14 transformants that showed plasmid-dependent rescue. These plasmids had identical or overlapping inserts as judged from restriction digests, and all 14 complemented both the immunosuppressant sensitivity and temperature sensitivity of the its8-1 mutant. Its8 was tagged at its C terminus with GFP carrying the S65T mutation (20Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). To express Its8·GFP under the control of a thiamine-repressible promoter in fission yeast, the coding region for theits8+ gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction, ligated to the N terminus of GFP, and the resultant construct was subcloned into pREP81 vector (21Maundrell K. Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant cells were grown in EMM overnight to mid-log phase, washed twice in EMM-inositol medium and at OD660 = 3, midlog-phase cells were resuspended in 15 ml of EMM-inositol and depleted of inositol for 2 h at 27 °C before the addition of 60 μCi ofmyo-[2-3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO). Cells were divided into subcultures and labeled for 4 h under various conditions as indicated. Radiolabeled cells were washed twice with 10 mmNaN3 and then resuspended in 150 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, chymostatin 0.1 μg/ml, aprotinin 2 μg/ml, pepstatin A 1 μg/ml, phosphoramidon 1 μg/ml, leupeptin 0.5 μg/ml, and antipain 2.5 μg/ml. Glass beads (0.2 g) were then added, and cells were broken mechanically by vortexing for 30 s, after which the tubes were placed in a boiling water bath for 1 min. Vortexing and heating were repeated eight times, after which the glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation. The extracted3H-labeled proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, processed for fluorography with 1 m sodium salicylate, and exposed to film at −80 °C (22Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Microsomes were prepared from OD660 = 9 of midlog-phase wild-type or mutant cells grown in YPD. Cells were resuspended in 450 μl of ice-cold homogenizing buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mmdithiothreitol containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmbenzamidine, 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite, chymostatin 0.1 μg/ml, aprotinin 2 μg/ml, pepstatin A 1 μg/ml, phosphoramidon 1 μg/ml, and leupeptin 0.5 μg/ml). Glass beads (0.2 g) were then added, and cells were broken mechanically by vortexing for 30 s, after which the tubes were placed on ice for 30 s. Vortexing and cooling were repeated five times, after which the glass beads and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 5 min. The supernatant was spun at 100,000 ×g for 1 h, and the pellet (microsomes) was suspended in 50 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH7.4, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and stored at −80 °C until use. The microsomes (50 μl) were mixed with 50 μl of buffer B (100 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH7.4, 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 15 mm MnCl2, 3 mm AMP, 30 μm palmitoyl CoA, 3 μg/ml tunicamycin, 0.2 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin) and 50 μl (2 μCi) of GDP-[3H]mannose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). After the incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, lipids were extracted twice with n-butanol and washed once with water. Mannolipids were separated on Kiesel gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3) and detected by exposure to a Fuji BAS1500 image analyzer (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 days. In some cases, the mannolipids were treated with GPI-specific phospholipase D before thin-layer chromatography as described previously (23Tsujioka H. Misumi Y. Takami N. Ikehara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A one-step gene disruption by homologous recombination (24Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) was performed. Theits8::ura4+ disruption was constructed as follows. The HindIII fragment containing theits8+ gene was subcloned into theHindIII site of pGEM-13Zf(+) (Promega). Then, aBamHI-PstI fragment containing theura4+ gene was inserted into theBamHI-PstI site of the previous construct (Fig.5A). The HindIII-EcoNI fragment containing the disrupted its8+ gene was transformed into diploid cells (5A/1D). Stable integrants were selected on medium lacking uracil, and disruption of the gene was checked by genomic Southern hybridization (data not shown). For microscopic observation, cells were washed with PBS. In some cases cells were fixed in 1.85% formaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and washed with PBS. Cells were dried on coverslips treated with poly-l-lysine and stained with DAPI and Calcofluor, dissolved in PBS to visualize the DNA or septum, respectively. To label vacuolar membranes, cells were incubated with medium containing 80 μm FM4-64 for 30 min at 27 °C (25Wang Y.X. Zhao H. Harding T.M. Gomes de Mesquita D.S. Woldringh C.L. Klionsky D.J. Munn A.L. Weisman L.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1375-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cells were then centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 1 min, washed by resuspending in new medium to remove free FM4-64, and collected by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min. Cells were then resuspended in new medium and again incubated for 2–3 h at 27 °C before microscopic observation. The fluorescence in non-fixed or fixed cells was observed using an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Photographs were taken with a SPOT2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Images were processed with the CorelDRAW (Corel Corporation Inc.). A genetic screen was performed to identify genes that share an essential overlapping function with calcineurin. For this purpose, we have developed a genetic screen using the immunosuppressive drug FK506 for mutants that depend on calcineurin for growth and have identified eight complementation groups (its1-8). As shown in Fig. 1, the its8-1mutant grew slightly slower than the wild type at 27 °C, grew very slowly at 33 °C, and grew extremely slowly or failed to grow at 36 °C. It could not grow in the presence of FK506 or CsA on the YPD plates, whereas the wild type could grow well under these conditions (Fig. 1). After longer incubation, small colonies appeared on the plate at 36 °C but not on the plate with FK506 (data not shown). Previous reports showed that calcineurin is an in vivotarget of FK506 in fission yeast and inhibition of calcineurin activity by the addition of FK506 to the culture medium resulted in identical phenotypes as those of calcineurin deletion (14Yoshida T. Toda T. Yanagida M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sugiura R. Toda T. Dhut S. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Nature. 1999; 399: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be anticipated that the its8-1 mutant requires functional calcineurin activity for vegetative growth, and tetrad analysis was performed to examine the synthetic lethality with Δppb1mutant. As expected, no double mutant was obtained, indicating that theits8 mutation and calcineurin deletion was synthetically lethal (data not shown). This suggests that calcineurin and Its8 share an essential overlapping function for cell viability. The its8+ gene was cloned by complementation of the temperature-sensitive growth defect (Fig.2A). It also complemented the FK506-sensitive growth defect (Fig. 2A). Nucleotide sequencing of the cloned DNA fragment revealed that theits8+ gene was SPBC24E9.08c. A BLAST search of protein sequence databases revealed that its8+encodes a 935-amino acid homolog of budding yeast Mcd4 (39%) (9Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and human Pig-n (34%) (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Mcd4 and Pig-n catalyze the addition of EtNP to Man1 of the GPI anchor core (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A single base change (C to T transition at the 1014th nucleotide from the start codon) was detected in the its8+ gene when the genomic DNA sequence from the its8-1 mutant was analyzed. This mutation resulted in replacement of a proline with a serine residue at position 288. This amino acid residue is conserved among Its8, Mcd4, and Pig-n proteins, but not among phosphodiesterases or nucleotide pyrophosphatases that share three highly conserved motifs (Ref. 9Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; Fig. 2B). The predicted topology of Mcd4 based on sequence analysis suggested that proline at 291 (corresponds to Pro-288 of Its8) is located in the large, hydrophilic N-terminal domain extending into the lumen of the ER, which is highly conserved in Its8, Mcd4, and Pig-n (9Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To confirm that Its8 is a functional homolog of Mcd4 and Pig-n and to study the role of calcineurin for GPI anchor synthesis, we examined inositol incorporation into proteins in wild-type cells andits8-1 mutants. This is because the GPI anchor contains an inositol moiety (26Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Desponds C. Bron C. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2233-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 27Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10193-10196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and GPI-anchored proteins are the only proteins known to be covalently attached to inositol (28Conzelmann A. Fankhauser C.

Cells were incubated at 27 °C in the absence of inositol for 2 h and labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol at 27 °C or at 36 °C for 4 h. To examine the effects of calcineurin inhibition, FK506 was added to the labeling medium (0.5 μg/ml) and incubated at 27 °C for 4 h. Labeled samples were then processed for SDS-PAGE. its8-1 mutant cells showed a decreased inositol labeling of proteins, and this was further reduced upon temperature upshift (Fig.2C). On the other hand, temperature upshift had no effect on the inositol labeling of the wild-type cells, and FK506 treatment had no effect on the inositol labeling of both its8-1 mutant and wild-type cells (Fig. 2C). These results are consistent with the idea that the P288S mutation does not completely abolish the enzyme activity of Its8, but causes a severe loss of function especially at the restrictive temperature. We examinedin vitro mannose labeling of microsomes to see whether Its8 is involved in GPI biosynthesis in S. pombe. Multiple mannolipids were generated by incubation of microsomes from either wild-type or its8-1 mutant with GDP-[3H]mannose. Some of them were not GPI intermediates, because they were resistant to GPI-specific phospholipase D. Membranes of its8-1 mutant generated one major mannolipid that was not seen in the wild-type (Fig. 3,arrow). This lipid appeared to be a GPI species because it was sensitive to GPI-specific phospholipase D (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). Although we could not pinpoint a step of GPI biosynthesis in which Its8 was involved, these results suggest that impairment of Its8 function resulted in an accumulation of one GPI species in the mutant. To investigate the intracellular distribution of Its8, Its8·GFP protein was expressed from a multicopy vector containing an attenuated version of the thiamine-repressiblenmt1 promoter. Its8·GFP was fully functional as demonstrated by its complementation of its8-1 mutant phenotypes (data not shown). Its8-GFP expressed in fission yeast exhibited a light double ring-like signal surrounding both the nucleus (defined by DAPI) and the cell surface (Fig.4). Most of the cells exhibited the double ring-like signal, and a few cells exhibited signals in the vacuolar membrane (defined by FM4-64). This pattern demonstrated the localization of Its8 protein in the ER and is consistent with the previous reports showing ER localization of Mcd4 (9Gaynor E.C. Mondesert G. Grimme S.J. Reed S.I. Orlean P. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 627-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and Pig-n (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To analyze Its8 function, the its8+ gene was knocked out in a diploid by homologous recombination using theura4+ marker gene (Fig.5A). Southern blotting of the genomic DNA of one such transformant confirmed that the wild-type gene had been replaced by the derivative containing theura4+ insertion (data not shown). Tetrad analysis revealed that the its8+ gene was non-essential. However, the Δits8 strain showed extremely slow cellular growth under all conditions tested (Fig. 5B). Δits8 strain could not grow in the presence of FK506 (Fig.5B) and the growth of the Δits8 strain was further inhibited by temperature upshift (data not shown). Microscopic observation revealed that most of the Δits8 cells were enormously enlarged and round-shaped (Fig. 5C). Multiseptated cells were also frequently observed. These microscopic findings suggest that Its8 is implicated in the establishment of cytokinesis and cell polarity. As described above, a shift to the higher temperature inhibited myo-[2-3H]inositol incorporation into proteins (Fig. 2C), suggesting that various phenotypes of the its8-1 mutant found at the restrictive temperature are due to the lowered synthesis of GPI-anchored protein caused by an impairment of Its8 function. Also, analysis of the Δits8strain is difficult because of its extremely slow growth. Then, we examined the phenotypic changes upon temperature upshift and upon FK506 treatment in its8-1 mutant to search the physiological function related to Its8 (Fig. 6). Cells grown to mid-log phase at 27 °C in liquid YPD medium were subjected to a shift to 33 °C or 36 °C, or to the medium containing FK506. Even at the permissive temperature of 27 °C, 20–25% of theits8-1 mutant cells had a division septum, compared with the 6–12% seen in a wild-type population (Fig. 6, A andC). Upon temperature upshift to 33 °C, the frequency of septated cells significantly increased (up to 65%), and cells with two or more septa were frequent (Fig. 6A). These results suggest that an impairment of Its8 function and reduced GPI anchor synthesis caused defects in cytokinesis in its8-1. Upon temperature upshift to 36 °C, enormously enlarged and round-shaped cells similar to Δits8 cells were observed in addition to septated cells (data not shown). To better understand the relationship between Its8 function and calcineurin signaling, we examined the effect of FK506 on the phenotypes of the its8-1 mutant. Strikingly, nearly 80% ofits8-1 mutant cells were septated 8 h after the addition of FK506 at 27 °C, whereas 30% of wild-type culture displayed septated cells (Fig. 6, B and D). The frequency of multiple-septated cells in the its8-1 mutant was unusually high, considering that the cells with multiple septa were rarely seen in wild-type cells under the same culture condition (Fig.6B). In addition, branched cells were also very frequent in the its8-1 mutant (Fig. 6B). These results strongly suggest that loss of calcineurin activity accentuated the defective cytokinesis and cell polarity control of its8-1mutant cells and that Its8 and calcineurin play an overlapping function in cytokinesis and cell polarity control. It has been shown that Mcd4 and Pig-n are molecular targets of BE49385A (8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To study whether Its8 is also a molecular target of BE49385A, we examined the effect ofits8+ overexpression on the sensitivity to BE49385A in wild-type cells. The full-lengthits8+ sequence was cloned in the multicopy vector pDB248 (19Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3143) Google Scholar). Cells transformed with pDB248-its8+ could grow well on plates containing 2 μg/ml BE49385A, whereas cells transformed with the empty vector grew very slowly on this plate. The wild-type cells exhibited impaired growth on plates containing 0.2 μg/ml BE49385A (Fig.7A). These results suggest that Its8 is also a target of BE49385A. The above results are very similar to those of Mcd4 overexpression in S. cerevisiae(8Hong Y. Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Mishkind M. Riezman H. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35099-35106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consistently, BE49385A inhibited inositol incorporation into proteins in fission yeast cells (Fig. 7C). The drug concentration required to inhibit the cell growth of fission yeast is much lower than that of budding yeast; however, very high concentrations of BE49385A could not completely inhibit the growth of fission yeast and inositol incorporation (Fig. 7, A andC).

Twelve amino acid residues in the N-terminal (residues 1–8) and N-loop (residues 11–20) regions of eotaxin have been individually mutated to alanine, and the ability of the mutants to bind and activate CCR3 has been determined in cell-based assays. The alanine mutants at positions Thr7, Asn12, Leu13, and Leu20 show near wild type binding affinity and activity. The mutants T8A, N15A, and K17A have near wild type binding affinity for CCR3 but reduced receptor activation. A third class of mutants, S4A, V5A, R16A, and I18A, display significantly perturbed binding affinity for CCR3 while retaining the ability to activate or partially activate the receptor. Finally, the mutant Phe11has little detectable activity and 20-fold reduced binding affinity relative to wild type eotaxin, the most dramatic effect observed in both assays but less dramatic than the effect of mutating the corresponding residue in some other chemokines. Taken together, the results indicate that residues contributing to receptor binding affinity and those required for triggering receptor activation are distributed throughout the N-terminal and N-loop regions. This conclusion is in contrast to the separation of binding and activation functions between N-loop and N-terminal regions, respectively, that has been observed previously for some other chemokines.

N. Engl. J. Med... 1998; 338: 436-445Google Scholar). Several diseases, including asthma and other allergic disorders, can result from the overaccumulation of leukocytes. There are two main classes of chemokines as defined by the pattern of the first two of four conserved cysteine residues located near the N-terminus (2Rollins B. Blood.. 2000; 90: 909-928Google Scholar). When the cysteines are adjacent, the chemokines are classified as CC chemokines and typically attract monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and T-lymphocytes. If a single residue separates the cysteines they are referred to as CXC chemokines and typically attract neutrophils or lymphocytes. There are also two minor classes, which include the C chemokine lymphotactin (3Kelner G.S. Kennedy J. Bacon K.B. Kleyensteuber S. Largaespada D.A. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Bazan J.F. Moore K.W.

Nature.. 1997; 385: 640-644Google Scholar). The receptors for chemokines (designated CCR or CXCR, according to the class of chemokine that activates them) are seven transmembrane helix G-protein-coupled receptors located in the leukocyte cell membrane (5Murdoch C. Finn A. Blood.. 2000; 95: 3032-3043Google Scholar). Chemokines of a certain class typically bind to a subset of receptors from the corresponding receptor class (2Rollins B. Blood.. 2000; 90: 909-928Google Scholar), although the determinants of receptor specificity are not well understood. In addition to their signaling roles, chemokine receptors, particularly CCR5, CXCR4, and CCR3 have been shown to be co-receptors, in conjunction with CD4, for HIV1 infection (6Berger E.A. Murphy P.M.

Through its interaction with CCR3, eotaxin facilitates the recruitment of eosinophils to the sites of parasitic infection or allergen stimulation (15Rankin S.M. Conroy D.M. Williams T.J. Mol. Med. Today.. 2000; 6: 20-27Google Scholar). Eosinophil accumulation is a hallmark of several human diseases, including Hodgkin's disease (15Rankin S.M. Conroy D.M. Williams T.J. Mol. Med. Today.. 2000; 6: 20-27Google Scholar) and inflammatory diseases of the lungs (asthma), heart (hypereosinophilic syndrome), intestines (inflammatory bowl disease and gastroenteritis), and skin (atopic dermatitis). The overexpression of eotaxin in many of these diseased tissues, along with its ability to recruit eosinophils, suggests a likely role for eotaxin in these inflammatory disorders (16Griffiths-Johnson D.A. Collins P.D. Rossi A.G. Jose P.J. Williams T.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1993; 197: 1167-1172Google Scholar,17Rothenberg M.E. Maclean J.A. Pearlman E. Luster A.D. Leder P. J. Exp.

Chemokines in Allergic Disease.Marcel Dekker, Inc. 1999; : 67-94Google Scholar). The structures of the monomeric subunits are largely conserved and consist of a single turn of helix followed by a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a C-terminal α-helix (Fig.1). The CC or CXC motif is contained in a long unstructured region (preceding the helical turn) that is covalently linked through a pair of disulfide bonds to the β-sheet and the loop connecting strands one and two (30s loop). Herein we refer to the region preceding the CC or CXC motif as the N-terminal region and the region between the CC or CXC motif and the helical turn as the N-loop region (Fig. 1). The quaternary structures of chemokines vary dramatically within the superfamily, with a range of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric structures seen, although there is convincing evidence that the monomer is sufficient for receptor activation (19Paavola C.D.

The conserved nature of the chemokine structure has revealed little information about the mechanism of receptor specificity. Extensive mutational studies of several chemokines have led to a proposed “two-step” model for receptor interaction in which the N-loop of the chemokine initially binds to the receptor then the N-terminal region of the chemokine docks with the receptor to induce a conformational change, resulting in receptor activation (21Crump M.P.

Recent papers describing the binding of receptor-derived peptides to a groove located between the N-loop and β2-β3 hairpin of their cognate chemokines (interleukin-8, fractalkine, eotaxin, and eotaxin-2) have reinforced the importance of the N-loop region for receptor binding (22Mayer K.L.

However, the specific protein residues in the chemokine that contribute to receptor interactions vary significantly between chemokines. Eotaxin, eotaxin-2, and eotaxin-3 differ from most chemokines in that they are specific for only one receptor, CCR3. In addition, eotaxin shares a high degree of sequence identity (∼60%) with the MCP proteins, which bind a different subset of receptors. This provides us with a good model system to study chemokine/receptor interactions and the determinants of receptor specificity. To this end, we have performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis on the N-terminal and N-loop regions of eotaxin to resolve which residues in these regions are involved in receptor interactions. Herein we report the results of these studies and their interpretation in light of the available data for other chemokines.

All cell culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type eotaxin and all eotaxin mutants were expressed and purified as described previously for wild type eotaxin (28Ye J. Kohli L.L. Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 27250-27257Google Scholar). In brief, the pET30a-eotaxin plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen, Santa Clarita, CA). Cells were grown at 37 °C to anA600 ≅ 0.7, induced with 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested 6 h later. Cells were resuspended in buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and lysed. The protein was loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose affinity column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), washed with 50 mmNa2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and eluted with 50 mmNa2HPO4, 500 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. The (His)6-tag was removed by treatment with thrombin (1 μg thrombin/mg eotaxin in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, room temperature, overnight). The cleaved protein was further purified on a Source 15 cation exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 20 mmTris, pH 8.5, using a 0 to 2 m NaCl gradient. HOS-CD4-CCR3 cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline, trypsinized, and resuspended in complete medium, counted, spun down, and resuspended in complete medium at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Fura-2 and pluronic-127 (both from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added to final concentrations of 2.5 μg/ml and 0.05%, respectively. The cells were incubated for 20 min in the dark at room temperature, brought to a total volume of 30 ml with complete medium, and incubated for another 20 min in the dark at 37 °C. The cells were then spun down and washed twice with 30 ml of flux buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution with 25 mm HEPES at pH 7.4), resuspended in the assay buffer at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and stored in the dark on ice until they were used (<2 h). Prior to the assay, 2 ml of cells were placed in a quartz cuvette and incubated in the fluorometer at 37 °C with stirring for 10 min. The fluorescence ratio was determined by exciting at 340 and 380 nm with emission monitored at 510 nm. Injections into the cuvette were done in a 10-μl volume. Data were collected on a SLM-AMINCO 8100 spectrofluorometer (SLM Instruments). The competitive binding assay was performed using previously reported procedures with slight modifications (31Kitaura M. Suzuki N. Imai T. Takagi S. Suzuki R. Nakajima T. Hirai K. Nomiyama H. Yoshie O. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 27975-27980Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 L1.2-CCR3 cells/ml in 25 mm HEPES, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (protease-free; Sigma), pH 7.6, were incubated with ∼0.15 nm125I-eotaxin (∼2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and increasing amounts of cold competitor protein in 250 μl for 1 h at room temperature. After the incubation period, the cells were layered onto an ice-cold sucrose cushion (20% sucrose, 140 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris, 0.4% bovine serum albumin (protease-free; Sigma), pH 7.6) and centrifuged for 10 min at 1500 × g. Both liquid layers were carefully aspirated, the cells were resuspended in scintillation fluid, and radioactivity was counted on a Packard 1600 TR liquid scintillation counter. Using SigmaPlot, the data were fit to the following equation: percent inhibition = (Bmax [L])/(IC50 + [L]), in which Bmax is the maximum binding, [L] is the cold competitor concentration, and IC50 is the midpoint of the transition. All binding assays were performed in duplicate. To assess the contribution of each amino acid side chain in the N-terminal and N-loop regions of eotaxin (residues 1–20) to receptor binding and activation, we individually mutated each residue to alanine. The only residues omitted from the scanning mutagenesis were glycine, proline, and alanine (because of their unique structural properties) and the two conserved cysteines residues (because of the requirement for the structural integrity of the protein). Thus, the following twelve residues were individually converted to alanine in this study: Ser4, Val5, Thr7, Thr8, Phe11, Asn12, Leu13, Asn15, Arg16, Lys17, Ile18, and Leu20 (Fig.1). All of the mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified using the protocol we have developed for wild type eotaxin with no modifications needed (28Ye J. Kohli L.L. Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 27250-27257Google Scholar). The mutants expressed at approximately wild type levels (∼5 mg/liter of culture). The ability of wild type eotaxin and each mutant to activate CCR3 was determined using a calcium mobilization assay performed on HOS cells expressing CCR3 on the surface. The observed calcium flux for wild type eotaxin is shown in Fig. 2 A, and the corresponding dose-response curve is presented in Fig. 2 B. The concentration required for half-maximal eotaxin activity is ∼7 nm, and maximum activity is seen for concentrations exceeding ∼30 nm. The activity of each mutant protein was determined at a concentration of 100 nm at which wild type eotaxin has maximal activity; the results are listed in Table I. Substantial losses of activity (<30% wild type activity) resulted from the substitutions at Val5 and Phe11, with F11A showing a near complete loss of activity (within experimental error) at 100 nm concentration. A moderate loss of activity (<80% wild type activity) was seen for substitutions at positions Ser4, Thr8, Asn15, Arg16, and Lys17, whereas substitution of alanine at residues Thr7, Asn12, Leu13, Ile18, and Leu20 produced mutant proteins with near wild type activity at 100 nm.Table IMutant activity/ wild type activityIC50nmWild Type11.2 ± 0.2S4A0.76 ± 0.0112.5 ± 2.4V5A0.28 ± 0.029.8 ± 2.7T7A0.97 ± 0.022.5 ± 0.4T8A0.71 ± 0.030.9 ± 0.2F11A0.07 ± 0.124.5 ± 4.9N12A1.11 ± 0.060.5 ± 0.1L13A1.03 ± 0.043.1 ± 0.7N15A0.45 ± 0.112.3 ± 0.3R16A0.61 ± 0.0212.2 ± 2.3K17A0.55 ± 0.063.5 ± 0.9I18A1.11 ± 0.018.6 ± 1.4L20A0.86 ± 0.023.1 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab The losses in activity observed in the calcium mobilization assay could potentially result from a decreased affinity for the receptor. Alternatively, the mutants might have wild type binding affinity but be unable to induce the receptor conformational change required for transmembrane signaling. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the ability of each mutant protein to inhibit binding of wild type eotaxin to CCR3 using a competitive radioligand binding assay performed using murine pre-B cells (L1.2) expressing CCR3 on their surface. A representative competition binding curve for wild type eotaxin is shown in Fig. 3. The concentration required for 50% inhibition of 125I-labeled wild type eotaxin binding (IC50) is 1.2 ± 0.2 nm. Eotaxin mutants in which the residue Thr7, Thr8, Asn12, Leu13, Asn15, Lys17, or Leu20 was replaced by alanine competed with labeled wild type eotaxin with IC50 values in the range 0.5 to 3.5 nm (TableI), i.e. within a factor of four of wild type eotaxin. A curve for N15A is shown as an example in Fig. 3. In contrast, a second group of mutants with alanine substitution at Ser4, Val5, Phe11, Arg16, or Ile18 had IC50 values in the range 8.6 to 24.5 nm (Table I),i.e. a decrease of more than 7-fold compared with wild type eotaxin. The curve for F11A is shown in Fig. 3. The receptor binding and activation data are summarized in Table I. Previous chemokine mutational studies, and their interpretation according to the prevailing two-step model for chemokine receptor activation, have suggested a separation of function between the N-loop and N-terminal regions of chemokines (21Crump M.P.

Clark-Lewis I. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 6996-7007Google Scholar). The N-loop is proposed to be important for providing the initial binding energy, whereas the N-terminus is suggested to be required for triggering receptor activation subsequent to binding. As discussed below, the current calcium mobilization and radioligand binding results for eotaxin mutants suggest that the functions of the N-terminal and N-loop regions of eotaxin are not separated in a straightforward manner. The following discussion is based on the premise that reductions in receptor binding affinity or activation upon mutation of a particular residue imply a role for that residue in the receptor interaction. As in all mutational studies, an alternative possibility is that the mutations induce a structural change in the protein, detrimentally affecting its ability to interact with the receptor. Although we have not experimentally excluded this possibility in the current study, it appears relatively unlikely considering that the mutations have all been made in regions of the protein that are known to be conformationally flexible (32Ye J. Mayer K.L. Stone M.J. J. Biomol. NMR.. 1999; 15: 115-124Google Scholar). A graphical representation of the influence of alanine mutations on the receptor binding and activity of eotaxin (Fig.4) illustrates the classification of mutants into four categories (groups 1–4 in Fig. 4). The alanine mutants at positions Thr7, Asn12, Leu13, and Leu20 (group 1) show near wild type binding and activity suggesting that their side chains do not play a major role in the mechanism of receptor activation. It is important to note that small reductions in activity (less than ∼5-fold increases in EC50 values) would not necessarily be detected by measuring calcium flux at 100 nmconcentration, so it remains possible that these mutations have subtle influences on receptor activation. The mutants T8A, N15A, and K17A (group 2, Fig. 4) all have near wild type binding affinity for CCR3 yet have reduced activation as measured by calcium mobilization. These results are interesting, because they not only confirm the predicted importance of the N-terminus (Thr8) for receptor activation but also implicate residues in the N-loop (Asn15 and Lys17) in activation of CCR3 by eotaxin. In a recent NMR study of binding between eotaxin and peptides derived from the N-terminus of CCR3, residues Asn15 and Lys17 of eotaxin underwent chemical shift changes upon addition of peptide (28Ye J. Kohli L.L. Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 27250-27257Google Scholar). These combined results suggest that the N terminus of CCR3 interacts with the N-loop residues Asn15 and Lys17 during the events that lead to receptor activation. A third class of mutants, S4A, V5A, R16A, and I18A (group 3, Fig. 4), each possess significantly perturbed binding affinity for CCR3 while retaining the ability to activate or partially activate the receptor. The mutation at Ile18 is interesting, because it shows a 7-fold reduced binding affinity yet has wild type activity at 100 nm. This can be rationalized by noting that even with its weakened binding affinity, significant I18A should be able to bind CCR3 at the 100 nm concentration used in the activity assays (>90% predicted receptor occupancy), allowing the production of a near wild type signal. As noted above for the group 1 mutants, it remains possible that the I18A mutation has a small effect on the EC50 for receptor activation. Importantly, two of these four group 3 mutants with reduced binding affinity are located in the N-loop (R16A and I18A), whereas the other two are located in the N-terminus (S4A and V5A). This observation again challenges the hypothesis of binding and activation functions being partitioned between these two structural elements. The importance of the N-terminus in receptor binding is supported by the observation that eotaxin truncated by two N-terminal residues displays reduced receptor binding affinity and activation (33Struyf S. Proost P. Schols D. De Clercq E. Opdenakker G. Lenaerts J.P. Detheux M. Parmentier M. DeMeester I. Scharpe S. Van Damme J. J. Immunol... 1999; 162: 4903-4909Google Scholar). NMR binding studies using receptor-derived peptides (28Ye J. Kohli L.L. Stone M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 27250-27257Google Scholar) support the involvement of the two N-loop residues in receptor binding; Ile18 is located at the base of the binding groove proposed in that study, and Arg16 is at the hydrophilic edge of the same groove. In addition to their weakened receptor binding affinity, mutants at positions Ser4, Val5, and Arg16also show reduced receptor activation in the calcium flux assay. It would not be unexpected for a mutation that affects receptor binding to also affect receptor activation. However, it is also possible for a mutation to affect both the initial binding step and the receptor-triggering event separately. Although it is difficult to interpret the influence of mutations at these positions on the receptor activation step, it is noteworthy that the three mutants all show approximately the same range of reduced binding (S4A, V5A, and R16A have IC50 values of 12.5, 9.8, and 12.2 nm, respectively) whereas V5A has a much greater effect than the other two mutations on eotaxin activity (23% of wild type for V5Aversus 76% for S4A and 61% for R16A). This comparison suggests that the mutation at Val5 is likely to affect both the initial binding and the receptor-triggering steps separately. Finally, the mutant Phe11 has little detectable activity and 20-fold reduced binding affinity relative to wild type eotaxin, the most dramatic effect observed in both assays. The substantial loss of receptor interactions at this position is not surprising as several mutational studies on other chemokines have implicated an aromatic residue at this position as being key for receptor binding and activation (19Paavola C.D.

Of some interest in the case of F11A in eotaxin is that the magnitude of the change of binding affinity is smaller than is seen in several other chemokines. For the CC chemokines MCP-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1β, mutation of the comparable aromatic position to alanine resulted in significant loss of activity for the proteins and 100- and 1000-fold weaker receptor binding affinity, respectively (34Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K.

For the CC chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) mutation of the aromatic residue to alanine resulted in 5000-fold weaker binding affinity for CCR3 (37Pakianathan D.R. Kuta E.G. Artis D.R. Skelton N.J. Hebert C.A. Biochemistry.. 1997; 36: 9642-9648Google Scholar). In all studies, the aromatic residue was shown to provide very important protein/receptor interactions. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis has been performed previously on the CC chemokines MCP-1 and RANTES (34Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Google Scholar, 35Jarnagin K. Grunberger D.

Results from the RANTES experiments are difficult to compare, as the protein is able to bind and activate several receptors, and experiments were performed using cells that may have expressed multiple receptors. In the case of MCP-1, no individual residues in the N-terminus were identified as being important for binding or activation of the receptor CCR2b. However, N-terminal truncation resulted in a complete loss of ability for the truncated protein to activate the receptor while still retaining the ability to bind CCR2b (19Paavola C.D. Hemmerich S. Grunberger D. Polsky I. Bloom A. Freedman R. Mulkins M. Bhakta S. McCarley D. Wiesent L. Wong B. Jarnagin K. Handel T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 33157-33165Google Scholar). Thus, it was suggested that, for the case of MCP-1, the exact nature of the side chains in the N-terminus is unimportant for activation of the receptor and that the mere presence of a polypeptide chain is sufficient for receptor activation once the vital binding step has occurred (35Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Diehl F. Freedman R. McCarley D. Polsky I. Ping-Tsou A. Kosaka A. Handel T.M. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 16167-16177Google Scholar). The only residue in MCP-1 found to be important for binding in either the N-terminal or N-loop regions was Tyr13 (corresponding to Phe11 in eotaxin) (34Hemmerich S. Paavola C. Bloom A. Bhakta S. Freedman R. Grunberger D. Krstenansky J. Lee S. McCarley D. Mulkins M. Wong B. Pease J. Mizoue L. Mirzadegan T. Polsky I. Thompson K. Handel T.M. Jarnagin K. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 13013-13025Google Scholar). These results contrast with those shown here for eotaxin, in which individual residues in the N-terminus are linked to binding and activation of the receptor, and several residues in the N-loop, in addition to Phe11, show involvement in receptor activation and binding. Thus, eotaxin displays a relatively diffuse or delocalized set of contributions to receptor binding and activation throughout the N-terminus and N-loop regions whereas MCP-1 has a more important single residue (Tyr13). These contrasting results for eotaxin and MCP-1, proteins similar in sequence that are specific for different receptors, provide some clues about the different mechanisms by which receptor specificity may be achieved. Several residues important for the binding and activation of CCR3 by eotaxin have been identified. The location of these residues demonstrates that the N-terminus and N-loop of eotaxin are each involved in both signaling and receptor binding. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that, at least for some chemokines, the N-loop and N-terminus do not have separable receptor binding and activation functions. The varying distributions of functionally important residues in different chemokines are likely to play an important role in controlling chemokine/receptor specificity."

Both a microtubule catastrophe-promoting activity and a tubulin sequestering activity were demonstrated for stathmin in vitro, and both could contribute to microtubule depolymerizationin vivo. Stathmin activity can be turned down by extensive phosphorylation on its four phosphorylatable serines, and down-regulation of stathmin activity by phosphorylation is necessary for cells to proceed through mitosis. We show here that microinjection of a nonphosphorylatable Ser to Ala (4A) quadruple mutant inXenopus two-cell stage embryos results in cell cleavage arrest in the injected blastomeres and aborted development, whereas injection of a pseudo-phosphorylated Ser to Glu quadruple mutant (4E) does not prevent normal development. Addition of these mutants to mitotic cytostatic factor-arrested extracts in which spindle assembly was induced led to a dramatic reduction of spindle size with 4A stathmin, and to a moderate increase with 4E stathmin, but both localized to spindle poles. Interestingly, the microtubule assembly-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous stathmin was abolished in the presence of 4A stathmin, but not of 4E stathmin. Altogether, this shows that the phosphorylation-mediated regulation of stathmin activity during the cell cycle is essential for early Xenopus embryonic development.

These sites are targets bothin vitro and in vivo of multiple kinases (for a review, see Ref. 11Lawler S. Curr.

Overexpression of phosphorylation target site-deficient mutants in mammalian somatic cells revealed that whereas wild-type phosphorylatable stathmin allows spindle formation at mitosis, a stathmin mutant in which the four phosphorylatable serines have been replaced by alanines (4A mutant) prevents formation of a normal spindle and results in a mitotic block of the cells (6Gavet O.

As the 4A mutant mimics the constitutively active form of stathmin, this shows that down-regulation of stathmin MT-destabilizing activity is likely required to allow formation of the mitotic spindle and progression through mitosis. However, it has been recently reported that a 4E pseudo-phosphorylated mutant, in which the four phosphorylation serines have been replaced by glutamic acid to mimic the constitutively down-regulated form, shows only a limited decrease in tubulin complex formation in vitro and in MT-destabilizing activity in transfected somatic cells (14Larsson N.

To investigate the in vivo importance of the phosphorylation state of stathmin in an embryonic cell system, we used wild-type human stathmin and the two 4A and 4E mutants. We introduced these recombinants stathmin proteins in two-cell stage embryos and in mitotic egg extracts from Xenopus laevis to examine their effects on embryo development and on the MT network. We then performed immunofluorescence experiments to detect the specific localization of the added forms in the mitotic egg extracts and extended these observations to somatic tissue culture cells. Low speed (15,000 × g) Xenopus egg extracts blocked in metaphase II of meiosis (CSF extracts) and permeabilized sperm heads were prepared as described previously (16Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Spindles were assembled at 22 °C in the interphase to mitosis pathway as described previously (17Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) by adding 0.2 mmCaCl2 for 1 h, then adding an equal volume of fresh CSF extract kept on ice to drive the extract back into mitosis. High speed extracts were prepared from CSF extracts spun at 245,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C in a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman) and were complemented with 0.05 volume of Energy Mix (150 mmcreatine phosphate, 20 mm ATP, 20 mmMgCl2). Recombinant human wild-type 4A (serine changed to alanine at positions 16, 25, 38, and 63) and 4E (serines substituted with glutamic acid) stathmin were in PBS at 10 mg/ml (18Curmi P.A. Maucuer A. Asselin S. Lecourtois M. Chaffotte A. Schmitter J.M. Sobel A. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, stathmin-expressing bacteria were sonicated, and the extracts were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min at 3,000 × g followed by 6 min at 400,000 × g. Stathmin was purified in a two-step procedure: anion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Recombinant stathmin was used in experiments to an amount equivalent to between three and five times the endogenous quantity estimated to be 110 μg/ml (2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Stathmin antibodies (both sera and affinity-purified) were polyclonal anti-COOH-terminal (C) and anti-internal (I) peptides of human stathmin. Antibody C was thus specific of the human form of stathmin, whereas antibody I recognized both human and Xenopus forms of stathmin (19Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J.

Monoclonal CTR453 was raised against centrosomes isolated from KE37 cells and specifically recognizes a 350-kDa antigen in the pericentriolar material (21Bailly E. Doree M. Nurse P. Bornens M.

Embryos were left to develop at 22 °C and fixed with methanol 9 h after fertilization and processed for immunofluorescence with anti-α-tubulin antibody according to Ref. 23Gard D.L. Hafezi S. Zhang T. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2033-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar. Embryos were observed with a fluorescence stereomicroscope (Leica MZFLIII) coupled to a Hamamatsu C5985 CCD camera. High speed extracts were incubated for 45 min at 22 °C with Me2SO (5%, ICN) and then were layered on top of a BRB80 (80 mmK-Pipes, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmEGTA)/40% glycerol cushion containing 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors: leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin (Boehringer). Centrifugation was at 22 °C for 20 min at 140,000 × g in a TLS 55 rotor (Beckman). A sample from the supernatant was taken and the remaining volume discarded; the pellet washed once with BRB80 and left to dry before an equal volume of Buffer A (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) was added to both supernatant and pellet fractions. An equal fraction in volume of both samples was loaded for 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blotting was done as in Ref. 25Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The following primary antibody dilutions used were: serum I, 1:10,000 and anti-α-tubulin, 1:200. Bound antibodies were detected by anti-rabbit coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Spindles assembled inXenopus egg extracts were fixed with cold methanol after dilution in BRB80, 30% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100 and spun onto coverslips. Coverslips were blocked with PBS-5% bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies (affinity-purified I and C, 1:40; GT 335, 1:5,000; CTR453, 1:500; autoimmune anti-NuMA, 1:200; anti-α-tubulin, 1:500). After three washes with PBS-Tween 20 (0.1%), coverslips were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate rhodamine-, fluorescein-, or 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin-3-acetic acid-conjugated antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). DNA was stained by a 5-min incubation with DAPI. After three washes, coverslips were mounted with AF1 solution (Citifluor) and observed with a Leica DMR fluorescence photomicroscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C5985 CCD camera, coupled to a Macintosh computer with Adobe Photoshop software. HeLa cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min, immediately or after a few minutes at room temperature in PBS. A Leica DMRXA fluorescence microscope was used for observation: image stacks (0.2 μm) were recorded using a piezoelectric objective (100 × 1.4 NA) positioning device and a MicroMAx CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). All images are maximal intensity projections. We microinjected the stathmin 4A and 4E mutants in one blastomere of two-cell stage X. laevis embryos, the uninjected blastomere representing an inner control, to investigate any interference with embryo development. The quantities injected correspond to the double of the endogenous amount of stathmin, estimated to be 110 μg/ml (2Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Embryos were photographed (Fig.1 A) and scored for normal development (Fig. 1 B) around mid-blastula transition (MBT) 9 h after fertilization, and during late gastrulation 22 h after fertilization. Injection of 4A stathmin resulted in cell cleavage arrest in 95% of the injected blastomeres as observed at MBT, and in exogastrulation or lysis at 22 h (Fig. 1, A andB). All 4A-injected embryos showed aborted development (data not shown). On the contrary injection of the 4E stathmin mutant resulted in no visible phenotype at all observed times and led to normal tadpoles, as was the case for PBS-injected embryos (Fig. 1,A and B). Immunofluorescence analysis using anti-α-tubulin antibody on 4A-injected embryos at the blastula stage revealed the absence of any polymerized tubulin in the injected half, and in particular the absence of mitotic spindles observed in the noninjected area where division and cleavage seemed normal (Fig.1 C). We thus show that injection of heterologous constitutively nonphosphorylated 4A stathmin affects MT dynamics in such a way that cell cleavage and normal embryo development is compromised, whereas the same amount of the constitutively pseudo-phosphorylated 4E form has no effect. It is known that overexpression in mammalian cells of stathmin with mutated nonphosphorylatable p34cdc2 sites prevents spindle formation in mitosis (12Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered if 4A stathmin, but not 4E stathmin, could block embryo development by specifically acting on MT dynamics at mitosis, thus preventing the formation of a functional spindle. It has already been shown that addition of 4A stathmin to in vitro assembled spindles results in a decrease of spindle size (26Andersen S.S. Ashford A.J. Tournebize R. Gavet O. Sobel A. Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Nature. 1997; 389: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We reproduced this result but extended our observations to the 4E mutant. We added the wild-type or the different stathmin mutants (in 3-fold quantity compared with the endogenous amount) to mitotic (CSF) egg extracts in which spindles were then assembled from sperm heads by the “interphase to mitosis pathway” (17Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Spindles were processed for immunofluorescence and their sizes measured (Fig. 2). Presence of 4A stathmin resulted in an important decrease in spindle size as compared with control conditions, whereas the spindle size was slightly increased by 4E stathmin (Fig. 2). The size of spindles assembled in the presence of heterologous wild-type stathmin was only moderately reduced, since this phosphorylatable form is known to be inactivated by extensive phosphorylation at mitosis (12Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26Andersen S.S. Ashford A.J. Tournebize R. Gavet O. Sobel A. Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Nature. 1997; 389: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus presence of nonphosphorylated 4A stathmin results in considerably smaller spindles, whereas the pseudo-phosphorylated 4E mutant allows formation of spindles with close to normal size. These results could explain the different effects on embryo development of the 4A and 4E mutants, as perturbed MT dynamics and small size would make the spindles obtained with 4A stathmin incompatible with correct cell division. We have recently identified both in Xenopus egg extracts and in somatic cells a new pathway in which it is the assembly of MTs that leads to stathmin hyperphosphorylation. Specifically, we have shown that MT assembly results in the additional phosphorylation, on stathmin Ser16, leading to the appearance of one or two bands with reduced electrophoretic mobilities (27Küntziger T. Gavet O. Manceau V. Sobel A. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of Ser16, which corresponds to an hyperphosphorylation, has been shown to be critical for the down-regulation of stathmin activity (5Melander Gradin H. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Lawler S. Gavet O. Rich T. Sobel A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This MT assembly-dependent phosphorylation is likely involved in MT stabilization during spindle formation and could contribute to global control of the MT network (see Fig.3 A and Ref. 27Küntziger T. Gavet O. Manceau V. Sobel A. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We wondered if MT assembly-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous stathmin in Xenopus egg extracts would be affected by the addition of exogenous recombinant mutant forms of human stathmin. The prediction was that adding 4A human stathmin would limit MT assembly and the resulting MT assembly-dependent phosphorylation on Xenopus stathmin. On the contrary, addition of 4E human stathmin would not significantly affect MT assembly and Xenopus stathmin hyperphosphorylation. Therefore, Me2SO was added to induce MT assembly together with mutant human proteins (in a 3-fold amount compared with the endogenous) to high speed CSF extract for 45 min at 22 °C before MTs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. Stathmin was then analyzed in supernatants by Western blot with antiserum I, which recognizes both human and Xenopus stathmin (19Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 B). Tubulin was also followed by Western blot in pellets to control for its polymerization. MT assembly by Me2SO resulted in the appearance of two additional Xenopus stathmin bands with reduced electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 3 B, lane C, arrows). As expected, the addition of the nonphosphorylatable 4A and 4E human stathmin mutants had distinct effects: 4A prevented the Me2SO-induced hyperphosphorylation of endogenous Xenopus stathmin, whereas 4E did not. As a control, none of the mutants did induce any hyperphosphorylation of endogenous stathmin in the absence of Me2SO. This shows that opposing MT assembly with the 4A mutant prevents hyperphosphorylation of Xenopus stathmin, whereas the pseudo-phosphorylated form does not. Therefore the effect of the 4A stathmin mutant on embryo development could result from both a direct perturbation of MT dynamics in mitosis and from preventing the MT assembly-dependent phosphorylation of endogenous stathmin, which contributes to spindle MTs stabilization (27Küntziger T. Gavet O. Manceau V. Sobel A. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We wondered next whether the significant amounts of human exogenous stathmin added would present a specific localization in the in vitro spindle assembly experiments. We performed therefore immunofluorescence on in vitro spindles formed inXenopus egg extracts (17Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 925-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Spindles were assembled from permeabilized Xenopus sperm heads in CSF extracts supplemented with either wild-type, 4A, or 4E recombinant human stathmin. Antibody C specific to human stathmin that does not recognize the endogenous Xenopus form (19Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was then used (Figs.4 A, panel b) together with mAb GT335 (Fig. 4 A, panel a), an antibody that recognizes polyglutamylated forms of tubulin that are particularly abundant on MTs in mitosis and at centrioles (20Bobinnec Y. Moudjou M. Fouquet J.P. Desbruyeres E. Eddé B. Bornens M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 39: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In all spindles, the wild-type form of human stathmin accumulated at spindle poles (see Fig. 4 A) with a peripheral localization reminiscent of MT minus end markers such as NuMA (29Merdes A. Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). To extend these observations to somatic cells, HeLa cells were processed for immunofluorescence either after saponin extraction followed by paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde fixation (data not shown) or after methanol treatment (Fig. 4 B). Cells were then double-stained with antiserum C, together with various anti-centrosome antibodies. Fig. 4 B shows in most cells, as expected from a soluble protein, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining for stathmin. However a specific accumulation at mitotic spindle poles in mitosis (Fig.4 B, panel a) and at aster centers in G2 (Fig. 4 B, panel a′) could be detected. The specific accumulation at spindle poles (Fig.4 B, panels c and f) was always peripheral to all markers used, as for NuMA (Fig. 4 B,panel b), antipericentriolar antigen antibodies (CTR453; Fig. 4 B, panel e), or anticentriolar antibodies (GT335; not shown). There was however a partial overlap of the stathmin staining with NuMA (compare Fig. 4 B, panel d withpanel g). The staining was sometimes found to be more abundant toward the exterior of the spindle pole and having the appearance of a horseshoe (see Fig. 4 B, panels fand g). The stathmin accumulation at spindle poles was no longer observed if antiserum C was preincubated with the peptide C-O (19Koppel J. Boutterin M.C. Doye V. Peyro-Saint-Paul H. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3703-3707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) against which the antiserum was raised (data not shown). The phosphorylation state of stathmin, an important physiological regulator of MT dynamics, appears to play an important role inXenopus egg embryonic development. Our results show dramatic differences in the effects of stathmin mutants with opposed phosphorylation profiles. The uncharged 4A mutant, which mimics constitutively nonphosphorylated stathmin, interferes with several important aspects of normal egg development, including cell cleavage, spindle size, MT assembly, and hence MT-dependent stathmin hyperphosphorylation. In contrast, the 4E mutant, which mimics constitutively phosphorylated stathmin by permanently harboring four negative charges, has no visible effects in this context. A number of studies performed both in vitro and in vivo have shown that nonphosphorylated stathmin promotes MT disassembly and that this activity is turned off by phosphorylation (see Ref. 11Lawler S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a review). Thus, overexpression of 4A stathmin in mammalian somatic cells destabilizes MTs, prevents formation of a normal spindle at mitosis, and blocks the cell cycle (6Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas a pseudo-phosphorylated mutant has no effect (3Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of wild-type phosphorylatable stathmin also destabilizes interphase MTs but allows spindle formation and normal progression through the cell cycle, because the kinase levels at mitosis are most likely sufficient for the phosphorylation of wild-type stathmin (6Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This shows that stathmin inactivation by phosphorylation is required to allow mitotic spindle formation and progression through mitosis. Therefore, the effect of 4A stathmin on Xenopus egg development reported here can be explained by its constitutive MT-depolymerizing activity, resulting in interference with spindle formation and preventing normal division and cleavage. Furthermore, we have shown in Xenopus egg extracts that MT assembly leads to hyperphosphorylation of stathmin specifically on Ser16 (27Küntziger T. Gavet O. Manceau V. Sobel A. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation of which is critical for turning down stathmin MT-depolymerizing activity (5Melander Gradin H. Marklund U. Larsson N. Chatila T.A. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3459-3467Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 6Gavet O. Ozon S. Manceau V. Lawler S. Curmi P. Sobel A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3333-3346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MT assembly-dependent hyperphosphorylation of stathmin allows MT stabilization around chromatin in mitotic egg extracts (27Küntziger T. Gavet O. Manceau V. Sobel A. Bornens M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), a mechanism required in mitotic spindle assembly (26Andersen S.S. Ashford A.J. Tournebize R. Gavet O. Sobel A. Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. Nature. 1997; 389: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We show here that the addition of an excess of nonphosphorylatable 4A stathmin prevents Me2SO-induced MT assembly and hence phosphorylation of endogenous stathmin on Ser16 (see Fig. 3). This could contribute, at least partially, to the impairment of normal spindle assembly and egg development. In contrast, the constitutively pseudo-phosphorylated 4E mutant, which does not prevent MT-dependent hyperphosphorylation of endogenous stathmin, does not interfere with normal Xenopus egg development. Altogether, our results indicate that the MT-dependent phosphorylation of stathmin in Xenopus eggs likely contributes to the regulation of mitotic spindle assembly. Our observation that 4E stathmin has no apparent effect on egg development apparently contradicts recent overexpression reports in somatic cells showing that the 4E mutant retains significant MT-depolymerizing activity (14Larsson N. Segerman B. Gradin H.M. Wandzioch E. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2242-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Holmfeldt P. Larsson N. Segerman B. Howell B. Morabito J. Cassimeris L. Gullberg M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However these experiments have been performed with a 20-fold overexpression level, whereas we performed 2–5-fold addition experiments, which proved to be sufficient with the 4A mutant to elicit effects on egg development. As 4E stathmin retains significant tubulin binding activity in vitro (13Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar,30Curmi P.A. Andersen S.S. Lachkar S. Gavet O. Karsenti E. Knossow M. Sobel A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12295-12302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and as tubulin sequestering represents a probable mechanism to explain stathmin MT-depolymerizing activity in cells, a large excess of 4E stathmin could result in an effect on MT stability that is not seen at close to physiological levels. Whereas the majority of stathmin is cytosolic, we observed a distinct accumulation of stathmin at spindle poles, both in HeLa cells and in spindles assembled in Xenopus egg extracts. Several factors, such as the MT-severing protein katanin (33McNally F.J. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Vale R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 561-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hartman J.J. Mahr J.

Ashford A.J. Kinoshita K. Tournebize R. Hyman A.A. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have been shown to concentrate at the centrosome. Two contrasting interpretations can be proposed for the centrosomal accumulation of a minor part of stathmin. It could correspond to a phosphorylated fraction contributing to the local stabilization of short, growing microtubules nucleated at the centrosomes during spindle assembly. Alternatively, once the spindle is assembled, an active pool of stathmin at the centrosome could contribute locally to the turnover of MTs at their minus ends in assembled spindles. It has been actually established in vertebrate cells and in Xenopus eggs extracts that spindle MTs were constantly depolymerizing at their minus ends as a result of poleward flux (38Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 637-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 39Sawin K.E. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 941-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, polar accumulation was observed in Xenopus egg extracts supplemented with wild-type, 4A, or 4E human stathmin, suggesting that it is independent of the stathmin phosphorylation state. The asymmetrical accumulation of stathmin at the spindle poles of somatic cells, toward the cell cortex rather than toward the chromosomes, is also striking. It could reflect stathmin interaction with complexes associated to the MT plus ends, that contain proteins such as dynein and dynactin (40Busson S. Dujardin D. Moreau A. Dompierre J. De Mey J.R.

Biol. 2000; 10: 865-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Altogether, this report demonstrates for the first time in an embryonic development system that the phosphorylation level of stathmin and its variations during the cell cycle have dramatic effects on cell development. We specifically show that the pseudo-phosphorylated form of stathmin does not apparently interfere with normal progression through the cell cycle in early developmental stages, as opposed to the nonphosphorylatable mutant. Furthermore, the fact that the effects of the 4A and 4E stathmin mutants are similar in a control extract, but totally different when tubulin is forced to assemble by Me2SO, shows that the stathmin phosphorylation level becomes critical only in conditions where the free tubulin concentration is very low (when tubulin is assembled into MTs). These observations could suggest that the pool of tubulin dimers ready to assemble in vivo is very low. We thank V. Doye for suggesting experiments and for stimulating discussions.

Based on the predicted secondary structure, almost all 7 S-like RNAs of eukaryotes and archaebacteria are about 300 nucleotides long and contain 8 helices. In contrast to the structural integrity of these 7 S-like RNAs, eubacterial 7 S-like RNAs differ in size and have relatively little sequence identity (29%) outside of the conserved domain. However, eubacterial 7 S-like RNAs have an identical 22-nucleotide sequence within helix 8. A phylogenetic study has revealed differences in the length and secondary structure of 7 S-like RNAs between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Almost all Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli andPseudomonas aeruginosa 7 S-like RNAs are around 120 nucleotides long and can be folded into a single hairpin, corresponding to helix 8 of mammalian 7 S RNA.

On the other hand, we showed that 4.5 S RNA can bind to the protein elongation factor, EF-G, indicating that 4.5 S RNA is also involved in translation (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K.

In addition, 4.5 S RNA depletion leads to an increase in the amount of EF-G associated with ribosomes, suggesting that 4.5 S RNA is concerned with the mode by which EF-G associates with ribosomes (16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that 4.5 S RNA is a bifunctional molecule that functions in translation and protein secretion by binding each protein. Because a ternary complex consisting of 4.5 S RNA, Ffh, and EF-G was undetectable in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the binding site for both proteins overlaps in 4.5 S RNA. Wood et al. (17Wood H. Luirink J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5919-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that nucleotides within the single-stranded region in helix 8 are important both for Ffh binding to the RNA and for optimal function of the RNA in vivo. This bulged structure is phylogenetically conserved among the 7 S-like RNA family (18Selinger D. Brennwald P. Liao X. Wise J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1353-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to accumulating information about Ffh binding, that structural features of 4.5 S RNA that are recognized by EF-G have not been investigated. The decanucleotide sequences from 1068 to 1077 of 23 S RNA (5′-GAAGCAGCCA-3′) and from 58–67 of mature 4.5 S RNA are identical (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15Brown S. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The corresponding region of 23 S RNA is considered important for one of the EF-G binding sites (19Sköld S.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 4923-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Moazed D. Robertson J.M. Noller H.F. Nature. 1988; 334: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 21Liljas A. Garber M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the decanucleotide alone is not sufficient for binding EF-G, suggesting that more higher level of structure of conserved bulge is also important for protein binding (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We investigated the RNA sequence and secondary structures affecting EF-G binding as follows. We performed deletion analysis of the 4.5 S RNA sequences, systematically altered bases and secondary structures, and assessed the consequences of these changes in vitro and in vivo. An NMR structural study of a mutant 4.5 S RNA (A47U) suggested that the bulged structure is important for protein binding. Escherichia colistrain S1192 (HfrH relA1 spoT1lacIq ffs::kan591 (λimm434 nin5XhoI::Φ(Ptacffs)) was a gift from S. Brown (Department of Molecular Biology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark) (14Brown S. Cell. 1987; 49: 825-833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The 5′ portion of the normal chromosomal 4.5 S RNA gene in this strain has been replaced by a kanamycin-resistance determinant. The chromosome contains a second bacterial ffs gene that is expressed from the inducible Ptac promoter as a part of a recombinant vector. A vector used to prepare the32P-labeled RNA was pSP64 (Promega, Madison, WI). Plasmid pKK223-3 (-op) is a derivative of pKK223 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), which contains the promoter sequence of thetac promoter without the putative repressor-binding site (16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, this plasmid can allow the gene cloned under thetac promoter to constitutively express in E. colicells. The 4.5 S RNA genes with or without mutations were synthesized by annealing two chemically synthetic oligo DNAs encoding each mutant and introducing them between the BamHI/PstI sites of pKK223-3 (-op) or between the BamHI/HindIII sites of pSP64. The DNA templates for in vitrotranscription were generated by BamHI digestion of plasmid DNAs of the pSP64 series encoding wild-type or mutant 4.5 S RNA. The transcription reaction contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 50 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm each of ATP, UTP, GTP, 25 μm CTP, 70 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), 10 μl of [α-32P]CTP (400 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, International, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK), 1 pmol of linearized DNA fragment, and 35 units of SP6 RNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo). After reaction, RNA was precipitated with ethanol twice. Purified RNAs were resolved in sterile and deionized water. The concentrations of radiolabeled RNAs were determined from the specific activity of [α-32P]CTP incorporation into the transcripts. Prior to use, RNAs were renatured by incubation for 15 min at 65 °C followed by slow cooling to room temperature. E. coli EF-G mutant (EF-GΔ-(1–91)), with a deletion of all upstream sequence up to and including the second GTP-binding sequence element, was expressed and purified as described by Suzuma et al. (10Suzuma S. Hayashi K. Nakamura K. Yamane K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To express EF-GΔ (1–91), E. coli M15 harboring both pREP4 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and the plasmid encoding mutant EF-G was cultured on LB plates in the presence of 50 μg/ml of ampicillin. A single colony was inoculated into 20 ml of 2XTY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 10 μg/ml kanamycin and then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. A 10-ml inoculum of the overnight cultures was added to 1 liter of 2XTY medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and then cultured toA600 = 0.6 at 37 °C and induced with 2 mm IPTG for 5 h at 37 °C. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min. and resuspended in sonic buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl) at 5 volumes/gram (wet weight). The suspension was disrupted by sonic oscillation (30-min bursts/30-min cooling/30-min bursts at 18 kc) using a Kubota Insonator Model 200m (Kubota Medical Appliance Supply Co., Tokyo, Japan) at 4 °C. The sonicate was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was dissolved in sonication buffer containing 8 m urea and then applied to a 20-ml column of Ni2+-nitroacetate resin (NTA; Qiagen) equilibrated with the same buffer. Weakly bound proteins were removed with buffer A (10 mm Na+, HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10× resin volume). Proteins attached to the resin were finally eluted with buffer A containing 0.2m imidazole. Fractions containing proteins were pooled and sequentially dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 m NaCl, 50% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.05 m urea. Purified proteins were stored at −30 °C. The 32P-labeled 4.5 S RNA probes (0.15 nm, 1.3 × 1018cpm/mol) were incubated for 1 min at room temperature with various concentrations of purified EF-G (0.001–10 μm) in 10 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.3% vanadium ribonucleoside complex, and 1 unit of poly (dI-dC)). The mixture was then diluted with 0.5 ml of washing buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol and immediately passed through nitrocellulose filters (Advantec, 0.45-nm pore size; Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Tokyo, Japan), which were washed with 1.5 ml of washing buffer. The levels of radioactivity remaining on the filters were determined using a liquid scintillation counter (LS5000TA , Beckman). The 49-nucleotide fragment corresponding to the region from 29 to 77 of wild-type 4.5 S RNA (SRP49) was made by annealing two synthetic oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were designed to attach the T7 phage promoter sequence at the 5′ end of RNA coding region. The 49-nucleotide DNA fragment encoding a mutant 4.5 S RNA where A at position 47 of wild-type 4.5 S RNA is replaced by U was also constructed (A47U). The SRP49 and the mutant (A47U) were synthesized using an Ampliscribe T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Epicentre Technologies Corporation). We prepared 15N-labeled RNA using 15N-NTPs (99.0 atom %, Nippon Sanso, Japan). After transcription, RNAs were purified by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions with 7 m urea. The RNAs were eluted from gel in 0.3 m sodium acetate, precipitated with ethanol, and desalted by ultrafiltration using Centricon-3 (exclusion molecular weight 3,000) (Amicon). The purified RNAs were incubated for 5 min at 95 °C and then cooled on ice. Samples containing 0.2–0.6 mm RNA were dissolved in 200 μl of 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, and NMR spectra were measured using a DRX-500 spectrometer (Bruker) at probe temperatures of 10–50 °C with symmetrical NMR microtubes (Shigemi Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Solvent signals were suppressed by the jump-and-return pulse (22Plateau P. Gueron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) for all experiments with pulse intervals of 65 μs. For one-dimensional measurements, the spectral width was 25 ppm, data points of 32 K were used, and the number of scans was 128. Prior to Fourier transformation, line broadening of 3 Hz was applied. Two-dimensional NOESY experiments (23Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Breslow R. Goodenough J.B. Halpern J.F. Rowlinson J.S.F. Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on One and Two Dimensions. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1987: 516-527Google Scholar) were acquired with a mixing time of 150 ms. 512 free induction decays of 2 K data points were collected using the States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) methods (23Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Breslow R. Goodenough J.B. Halpern J.F. Rowlinson J.S.F. Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on One and Two Dimensions. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1987: 516-527Google Scholar); the number of scans was 256. Prior to Fourier transformation, π/2-shifted squared sine bell function for the t2 dimension and π/2-shifted sine bell function for the t1dimension were applied, and zero-filling was applied to acquire real 2K 1K spectra. For two-dimensional 15N-1H HMQC experiments, the interpulse delay was 4 ms, and 15N was decoupled according to the GARP (global optimized alternating-phase rectangular pulses) scheme (24Shaka A.J. Baker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) with a 90 °C pulse of 150 μs. Free induction decays (16 scans each) of 4 K data points in the t2 domain were collected for 64 data points in the t1 domain in the phase-sensitive mode using the States-TPPI method (23Ernst R.R. Bodenhausen G. Wokaun A. Breslow R. Goodenough J.B. Halpern J.F. Rowlinson J.S.F. Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on One and Two Dimensions. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1987: 516-527Google Scholar). The spectra of 2K × 256 data points were obtained by zero filling thet1 domain and the π/2-shifted sine bell function for both the t1 andt2 dimensions followed by Fourier transformation. The spectral width for 15N was 100 ppm. E. coli 4.5 S RNA can bind both Ffh and EF-G. We examined the dose dependence of Ffh and EF-G Δ-(1–91) binding upon full size 4.5 S RNA using a filter binding assay as described by Suzuma et al.(10Suzuma S. Hayashi K. Nakamura K. Yamane K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding affinity values (M 12) for Ffh and EF-G, defined as the concentration that gave half-maximal binding, were 0.15 and 1.5 μm, respectively, indicating that the affinity of EF-G for 4.5 S RNA was lower than that of Ffh by approximately one order of magnitude. Fig. 1 shows that E. coli 4.5 S RNA can be folded into a single hairpin. This structure is considered homologous to domain IV of mammalian SRP RNA (7 SL RNA). In addition to the secondary structure, several nucleotides are highly conserved. These lie with the tetranucleotide loop and its adjacent single-stranded bulged regions. No other regions are universally conserved in the primary sequence of 7 SL-like RNAs. Moreover, among bacterial SRP RNAs, the numbers and structures of single-stranded bulges are conserved (25Schmitz U. Freymann D.M. James T.L. Keenan R.J. Vinayak R. Walter P. RNA. 1996; 2: 1213-1227PubMed Google Scholar). A mutational study demonstrated that nucleotides within the bulge regions are important for Ffh binding to the RNA (26Gowda K. Zwieb C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Lentzen G. Moine H. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 1996; 2: 244-253PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the role of the bulge(s) and to identify which nucleotides are essential for EF-G binding, we performed site-directed mutagenesis studies on each bulge region. The ability of EF-G to bind the mutant 4.5 S RNAs was examined using a nitrocellulose filtration assay (Fig.2). Within bulge A, point mutations at positions 47, 60, 61, 62, and 63 completely abolished binding, whereas those at G48U and G49C did not. A mutation from A to U at position 67, which lies within bulge B, also completely abolished the ability to bind EF-G, whereas point mutations within the opposed bulged residues at positions 39, 40, 41, and 42 did not. In contrast, all point mutations induced within bulges C, D, and E did not affect binding to EF-G. These results suggest that the nucleotide region that includes bulges A and B is necessary for EF-G binding.Figure 2Protein binding activities of wild-type 4.5 S RNA and site-directed mutants at bulgesA–E. Nucleotide replaced derivatives of 4.5 S RNA were filter-assayed as described under “Materials and Methods,” and radioactivity retained on filters was plotted against the concentration of added EF-G.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As a prerequisite to structural studies of the RNA required for protein binding, a minimal RNA site for specific protein binding had to be developed. This was accomplished by the systematic deletion of entire bulges or portions of helices from wild-type 4.5 S RNA. Genes encoding deletions were constructed by annealing two complementary single-stranded DNAs. Each deletion mutant contained a complementary sequence at the 5′ and 3′ termini (5′-GGGGG-3′ and CCCCCACCC-3′) to minimize the potential for alternative secondary structure formation as a result of deletion (Fig.3A). Mutants 1 and 2, in which bulges E or both D and E were deleted, bound to EF-G with wild-type affinity (Fig.3 B). Another mutant with three deleted bulges (C, D, and E) also bound to EF-G with wild-type affinity. Mutant 3 consisted of bulges A and B in addition to the conserved domain IV, demonstrating that the structure of mutant 3 contains all the elements required for interaction with EF-G. To assess the importance of bulges A and B, we constructed mutants 4 and 5 that contained either bulge A or B in addition to the stem-loop structure. Fig. 3 B shows that bulge A by itself has and can maintain appreciable binding affinity, whereas mutant 5 completely loss the activity. These results indicate that bulge A constitutes a minimal site in 4.5 S RNA required for binding to EF-G. To examine the ability of the constructed deletion mutants shown in Fig. 3to restore the growth of E. coli S1192 in the absence of IPTG, wild-type and deletion mutant 4.5 S RNA genes were inserted into plasmid pKK223–3 (-op) and introduced into S1192. The introduced genes were under the control of the tac promoter with a deleted operator sequence in all constructs. Therefore, the expression of 4.5 S RNA on the plasmid was independent of IPTG. The single copy of the 4.5 S RNA gene in the chromosome of S1192 is regulated by thelac repressor and requires IPTG for growth except when harboring a plasmid that provides 4.5 S RNA function. Therefore, growth in the absence of IPTG would be a good indicator of mutant function. The growth was maintained by a strain harboring wild-type 4.5 S RNA (Fig. 4) but was abolished by a plasmid without an insert in the absence of IPTG (data not shown), indicating that the phenotype of plasmid-borne 4.5 S RNA can be assessed using this in vivo system. The growth of transformants expressing mutants 1 and 2 was identical to that of wild-type 4.5 S RNA (Fig. 4). In contrast, mutants 4 and 5 no longer supported the growth of S1192 (Fig. 4). Mutant 3, which has decreased binding activity to EF-G, can restore the growth of S1192 but to a level of only half that of wild-type 4.5 S RNA. These results indicate a close relationship between the protein binding and growth restoration activity of 4.5 S RNA-depleted cells. Fig.5 a shows two-dimensional15N-1H HMQC spectra (imino proton region) of the SRP49 (black) and A47U (red) at 25 °C. The imino proton resonances of G and U were distinguished by their corresponding 15N chemical shifts. The resonances were assigned by analyzing two-dimensional NOESY spectra as follows (data not shown). The imino proton resonances of three SRP49 G:U pairs U36:G70, U37:G39, and U45:G64 were identified by their unique chemical shifts and strong intra-base pair NOEs. The imino proton resonance of G53 in the GGAA tetraloop was also identified by its unique chemical shift (25Schmitz U. Freymann D.M. James T.L. Keenan R.J. Vinayak R. Walter P. RNA. 1996; 2: 1213-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 28Heus H.A. Pardi A. Science. 1991; 253: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Starting from these unique resonances, resonances were sequentially assigned by NOE connectivity as U36/G70-G5-G4-G3-G2-G1, U45/G64-G44, and G53-G57-G58. The assignments of imino protons of SRP49 in this study were consistent with earlier NMR findings of SRP RNA (25Schmitz U. Freymann D.M. James T.L. Keenan R.J. Vinayak R. Walter P. RNA. 1996; 2: 1213-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 28Heus H.A. Pardi A. Science. 1991; 253: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 29Schmitz U. Behrens S. Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Lukavsky P. Walter P. James T.L. RNA. 1995; 5: 1419-1429Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The imino proton resonances of U37, U38, G43, G49, U50, G54, G61, and G69 could not be observed or assigned because of broadening of the resonances, suggesting that these imino protons are not involved in hydrogen bonding. These results are summarized as the secondary structure shown in Fig. 5 b. The spectra of SRP49 and A47U are almost identical except for three resonances (13.54, 13.25, and 13.02 ppm, Fig. 5 a, red triangle) and the disappearance of the two resonances (11.85 and 11.34 ppm, Fig. 5 a, black triangle). From the analysis of two-dimensional NOESY spectra, most of the imino proton resonances were assigned as described above (data not shown). The two missing resonances were assigned to a U45:G64 pair, because this pair is closest to the substituted residue (A47U) among the observed G:U pairs. This assignment was consistent with the fact that the resonances at 11.90 and 11.43 ppm were assigned to the U36:G70 pair based on the NOE connectivity of U36/G70-G5-G4-G3-G2-G1. Although the new resonances could not be assigned sequentially because of the lack of NOEs, the resonance at 13.54 ppm was identified as an A:U pair because of the presence of a typical NOE between the imino proton of U and the H2 proton of A (data not shown). Because the U45:G64 pair disintegrated and a new A:U pair formed in the A47U mutant, we proposed the secondary structure shown in Fig. 5 c, in which U45 bulges outward. The proposed secondary structure is similar to that of SRP49 except for the proposed EF-G binding region, which is consistent with the fact the spectra of SRP49 and the A47U mutant were almost identical except for five resonances. Accordingly, we suggest that the conformation around U47 in the A47U mutant differed from that of the corresponding region in SRP49 and that other regions were similar between the A47U mutant and SRP49. Thus, the loss of EF-G binding activity in A47U may result from destruction of the active conformation around A47. Our previous study suggested that 4.5 S RNA is dual function and participates in both translation and secretion by interacting with EF-G and Ffh, respectively (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here we examined the region required for EF-G binding by introducing substitutions and deletions with the 4.5 S RNA coding region of the ffs gene. The effects of sequence elements and the secondary structure of phylogenetically conserved bulged regions were measured by mutagenic alteration of 4.5 S RNA. Changing any of the bulges C, D, or E did not significantly affect the binding activity. Moreover, even in bulge A or B, changes in nucleotide positions 39, 40, 41, 42, 48, and 49 did not reveal a key role in EF-G protein binding. In contrast, nucleotides 60, 61, 62, 63, and 64 in the conserved decanucleotide sequence were important for efficient binding because some mutations at this site almost completely abolished the binding. This result is consistent with our data showing that wild-type 4.5 S RNA can compete with 23 S RNA for binding to EF-G, but mutants with base substitutions in the decanucleotides cannot (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Wood et al. (17Wood H. Luirink J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5919-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) demonstrated that point mutations within the bulged residues at positions 47, 48, 49, 61, and 62 completely abolish binding to Ffh, whereas mutations at positions 60 and 63 do not affect the binding. Taken together, these data suggest that nucleotides within single-stranded regions in bulges A and B are important for binding to both proteins and that the nucleotides essential for binding to each protein are overlapping but not identical. Our present data using deletion mutants indicated that mutant 2, consisting of 49 nucleotides (SRP49), is sufficient for protein binding and can restore the growth of 4.5 S RNA conditional mutant in the absence of IPTG. This 4.5 S RNA is the shortest among known SRP 7 S-like RNAs. Defining regions for EF-G binding would be useful in generating a minimal structure that would allow structural analysis by NMR. The structures of 24-, 28-, and 43-nucleotide fragments of 4.5 S RNA have been studied using multidimensional NMR (25Schmitz U. Freymann D.M. James T.L. Keenan R.J. Vinayak R. Walter P. RNA. 1996; 2: 1213-1227PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schmitz U. Behrens S. Freymann D.M. Keenan R.J. Lukavsky P. Walter P. James T.L. RNA. 1995; 5: 1419-1429Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Schmitz U. James T.L. Lukavsky P. Walter P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the complex between the RNA-binding domain of Ffh (M domain) and the fragment of 4.5 S RNA has recently been determined at a resolution of 1.8 Å (31Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This result demonstrates that in the symmetric loop (bulge A), stacking of five consecutive non-canonical base pairs generates a unique helical structure with a shallow minor groove. This groove in the symmetrical internal loop A (bulge A, in this study) is recognized by the α-helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif contained within the five α-helices of the Ffh M domain. Moreover, this groove was occupied by the hydrophobic segment of a neighboring M domain. In vitrochemical protection of 4.5 S RNA by Ffh showed that the protein mainly protects the 5′ side of domain IV, with highly conserved nucleotides A39, A47, G48, and G49 being the most protected (27Lentzen G. Moine H. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Wintermeyer W. RNA. 1996; 2: 244-253PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotides that are essential for EF-G binding were located opposite those important for Ffh binding, from the 3′ side of bulge A. The EF-G binding sites within 4.5 S and 23 S rRNA contain the same decanucleotide sequence. This decamer RNA sequence is included in the recent reported structure of ribosomal protein L11 in complex with a fragment of 23 S rRNA (32Wimberly B.T. Guymon R. McCutcheon J.P. White S.W. Ramakrishman V. Cell. 1999; 97: 491-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 33Conn G.L. Draper D.E. Lattman E.E. Gittis A.G. Science. 1999; 284: 1171-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Comparison of the EF-G binding sites in 4.5 S RNA and 23 S rRNA shows that the last five decanucleotide residues have almost identical conformations (31Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A. Science. 2000; 287: 1232-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 34Jovine L. Hainzl T. Oubridge C. Scott W.G. Sizma T.K. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Nagai K. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, the first decanucleotide residues have a distinct orientation, showing a common structural feature likely to be important for the recognition of both RNAs by EF-G. To compare the tertiary structure of the proposed protein binding site, we constructed a model structure of the A47U mutant in which bulge A forms an A-type helical structure (Fig. 6), because substitution of A47 with U caused a loss of binding activity to both Ffh and EF-G. Therefore, remarkable conformational changes must occur in the binding region of the A47U mutant. Fig. 6 shows that at least three standard base pairs are stretched. Moreover, the amino groups of C46 and C62 were involved in base pairing, and the protruding phosphate backbone that may interact with proteins as a hydrogen bond acceptor in SRP RNA is different between the SRP49 and A47U mutant models. Thus, single changes can cause large conformational changes that may have brought about the loss of Ffh and EF-G binding affinity in the A47U mutant. Replacement of A47 with cytosine did not affect the binding activity (data not shown), suggesting that A47 is important for maintaining non-canonical helices rather than because it is recognized by proteins. Here, we have defined the minimal structure of 4.5 S RNA for binding EF-G. Taken together with previous data reported by Wood et al. (17Wood H. Luirink J. Tollervey D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5919-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), these data suggest that Ffh and EF-G proteins recognize overlapping domains in the 4.5 S RNA. As mentioned above, an identical decanucleotide sequence is found in the EF-G binding sites of both 4.5 S and 23 S rRNA. Jovine et al. (34Jovine L. Hainzl T. Oubridge C. Scott W.G. Sizma T.K. Wonacott A. Skarzynski T. Nagai K. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 527-540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (54) Google Scholar) indicated that the last five decanucleotide residues have almost identical conformations (root mean square deviation = 0.96 Å). With this structure resemblance, 4.5 S RNA can acquire the ability to compete with 23 S rRNA. Moreover, it is plausible that these sequences in both 4.5 S and 23 S rRNA act as the first binding site for EF-G. The biological function of the interaction between 4.5 S RNA and EF-G during translation remains to be determined. On the basis of all previous data including the structural comparison, we proposed that 4.5 S RNA might facilitate EF-G-GDP to be expelled from the ribosome by competing with 23 S rRNA for EF-G binding (9Shibata T. Fujii Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura K. Yamane K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13162-13168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Nakamura K. Fujii Y. Shibata T. Yamane K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However depletion of 4.5 S RNA leads to the rapid inhibition of translation, and this loss of translation by depletion of 4.5 S RNA extends to the whole protein (13Bourgaize D.B. Fournier M.A. Nature. 1987; 325: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions 4.5 S RNA is not a stable component of the ribosome, but once cells are treated with fusidic acid or viomycin, 4.5 S RNA comigrates with 70 S ribosome in a sucrose gradient. Under these conditions, distribution of Ffh protein was unchanged. Moreover, our quantitative analysis demonstrated that almost all Ffh protein in a cell makes a stable complex, and the amounts of this complex are unchanged through cell growth (10Suzuma S. Hayashi K. Nakamura K. Yamane K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 180: 271-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the function of 4.5 S RNA in translation may be separable from that in protein secretion. Therefore, even if EF-G and Ffh can compete for 4.5 S RNA binding, this might not contribute to the function of 4.5 S RNA in translation. We thank N. Foster for critical reading of the manuscript."

Cationic lipids are rare in animal cells and tissues (see “Discussion”). PLPS has the novel effect of inducing signal transduction in neuronal cells, particularly neuritogenesis in PC12 cells without addition of nerve growth factor; i.e. PLPS mimics the effect of nerve growth factor (7Sakakura C. Igarashi Y. Anand J.K. Sadozai K.K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 946-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). During previous studies, we noticed the presence of cationic lipids having slower TLC migration rate than PLPS in human brain (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore undertook further systematic study of cationic lipids with plasmal conjugate in bovine brain.During isolation of cationic GSLs of bovine brain white matter by CM-Sephadex chromatography, we found a new compound different from previously known PLPS, characterized by much slower migration rate on TLC in various solvent systems. The new compound showed a chemical composition similar to that of PLPS but had an additional polar group, and is hereby termed PLPS x, or Px. In this report, we describe detailed structural analysis of this novel compound.DISCUSSIONThe present study indicates the presence of a significant quantity of a cationic GSL with plasmal conjugate, Px, having highly novel structure, in white matter of bovine brain. Px is characterized by properties similar to those of PLPS A and B, i.e. (i) Px and PLPS A and B are co-eluted with the same solvent (ionic strength 0.20–0.23 m triethylamine in methanol) and separated from psychosine; (ii) TLC behavior similar to that of PLPS in basic, neutral, and acidic solvents; (iii) both Px and PLPS yield psychosine and plasmal on weak acid hydrolysis. On the other hand, Px has certain properties distinct from those of PLPS: (i) Px has an additional polar group showing much slower TLC mobility than PLPS in all solvents tested. (ii) Preliminary negative-ion LSIMS of Px in comparison to PLPS A and B clearly indicated that Px has the higher molecular mass. Px had a molecular mass 92 Da higher in deprotonated molecules [M−H]− than that of PLPS; this difference in molecular mass corresponds to glycerol. (iii) Px has only one 6-O-substitution, whereas PLPS A has 3,4-di-O-substitution, and PLPS B has 4,6-di-O-substitution on methylation analysis. (iv) The sequence of the components and molecular species of aldehyde are characterized as a glycerol-O-aldehyde(16:0, 18:1, and 18:0)-O-Hex-Sph, by LSIMS and ESIMS of native and methylated compounds. (v) The structure was established unambiguously as a glycerol derivative of PLPS by 1H and 13C NMR.The novelty of the Px structure lies in the mode of plasmal conjugation, i.e. the way that O-plasmal conjugate is linked at C1 at two primary hydroxyl groups at glycerol and galactose. The glycerol residue may interact with galactosyl residue to achieve steric stability, such that axes of two aliphatic chains, sphingosine and plasmal, are oriented in parallel regardless of the C1 stereoisomer of plasmal. A tentative minimum energy conformational model is shown in Fig. 4. No similar structure has been observed previously in any plasmal conjugated compound. The most common plasmal conjugates are based on O-vinyl ether,i.e. O-alk-1-enyl group linked to one of the hydroxyls of glycerophosphoethanolamine or glycerophosphocholine, as observed typically in plasmalogen (for review see Refs. 27Hanahan D.J. Lipide Chemistry. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1960: 92-105Google Scholar, 28Debuch H. Seng P. Snyder F. Ether lipids: Chemistry and Biology. Academic Press, New York1972: 1-24Google Scholar). Another group of plasmal conjugates is based on cyclic acetal linked to a vicinal dihydroxyl group of galactosyl residue linked to Sph, ceramide, or diglyceride (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Hakomori S.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We term this compound with novel structure “glyceroplasmalopsychosine.”The biosynthetic mechanism of either O-cyclic acetal or novel acetal, as now found in Px, is totally unknown at this time. In contrast, biosynthesis of O-alk-1-enyl structure as found in plasmalogen was well established through the 1-alkyl desaturase system, a microsomal mixed-function oxidase (29Snyder F. Lee T. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Vol. 2, Biosynthesis and Metabolism. 2nd. Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). Release of free fatty aldehyde (plasmal) appears to be a prerequisite for synthesis ofO-acetal conjugates; however, the mechanism for this is still ambiguous. Three biochemical routes have been proposed: (i) action of acyl-CoA reductases in the presence of NADPH; (ii) oxidative cleavage of alkyl glyceride by alkyl mono-oxygenase (tetrahydropterine; Pte-H4-dependent); (iii) specific hydrolase for plasmalogen (“plasmalogenase”) capable of hydrolyzing O-alk-1-enyl group (30Snyder F. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 183-210Google Scholar). However, released fatty aldehyde is transient and immediately converted to fatty alcohol or fatty acid, and it is perhaps utilized for O-acetal conjugation. The entire process may take place in the microsomal membrane.Although the mechanism of O-plasmal conjugate formation is unknown, it may be an enzymatic reaction coupled with either plasmal-forming reaction i, ii, or iii as above. This concept is supported by the following observations: (i) Specificity of plasmal conjugate always occurs at β-galactosyl but not other sugar residues (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Hakomori S.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such specificity cannot be associated with non-enzymatic reaction. (ii) Plasmal conjugate as plasmalocerebroside was detectable by MALDI-TOF of sphingolipid extract from as little as 200 mg of wet weight of Eker rat brain white matter but not from gray matter extract of the same brain. The level of plasmalocerebroside was many times higher in brain from Eker rats with hereditary renal carcinoma (31Taketomi T. Hara A. Uemura K. Sugiyama E. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that biosynthesis of acetal conjugates is enhanced in pathological processes and rules out the possibility that they are formed during the isolation procedure. (iii) The yield of Px from bovine brain white matter is consistent regardless of amount of material used or whether old (long-term frozen) versus fresh samples are used, i.e. 0.55–0.60 μmol per kg. (iv) The yield of PLPS from human brain is ∼10× higher than that from bovine brain, as found in both our previous and present studies. This indicates that a consistent level of plasmal conjugate is synthesized in brain and that the level varies depending on species. (v) No Px or PLPS was yielded when a mixture of plasmal and psychosine was incubated with or without glycerol for various durations, and the yield of PLPS was the same as that directly from the homogenate when human brain white matter homogenate was incubated with plasmal and psychosine or with phosphatidylethanolamine containing plasmalogen.NMR data indicate that two stereoisomers with regard to the asymmetric C1 carbon of plasmal in Px are detected in a ratio of ∼1:1, whereas those of PLPS are found exclusively in only one form (“endo type”). This may reflect a difference in stability of plasmal linkage in these two compounds, i.e. the linkage in Px is much more unstable than that in PLPS (see under “Experimental Procedures”: “Determination of Lipids Containing Aldehyde Using Schiff's Reagent”). Anomeric conversion of sugars as detected by mutarotation depends highly on stability of glycosidic linkage; e.g. N-glycosides are in general much more unstable thanO-glycosides, if the same sugar is linked to a similar aglycon. Susceptibility of mutarotation is higher in unstableN-linked structures than in O-linked structures. It is possible that the ratio of Px stereoisomers A and B is different in nascent product compared with those after isolation, although this is difficult to demonstrate at this time. In stereoisomers A and B, general conformational structure is very similar in terms of axes of two aliphatic chains and location of sugars.In general, lipids can be classified as acidic, neutral, zwitterionic, or cationic based on their ionic properties. Positive ionic properties of cationic lipids (which include psychosine and other lyso-GSLs, Sph, and dimethyl-Sph) are ascribable to the amino group of Sph. Cationic lipids having free Sph amino group, though a minor component, modulate activity of growth factor receptor kinase, protein kinase C, or other membrane-bound signal transducer molecules located at upstream regions of signal transduction pathways. This event leads to up- or down-regulation of key molecules, located downstream, which control transcription. For example, Sph and dimethyl-Sph inhibit PKC (32Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Toyokuni T.

Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5385-5389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and many other protein kinases that modulate chaperone effect, e.g.Sph-dependent kinase 1 for 14-3-3 protein (35Megidish T.

Hamaguchi A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3369-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another example is activation by PLPS of Trk A tyrosine kinase in PC12 cells, leading to enhancement of mitogen-activated protein kinase. This mimics the effect of nerve growth factor, because withdrawal of PLPS induces apoptosis (7Sakakura C. Igarashi Y. Anand J.K. Sadozai K.K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 946-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PLPS weakly inhibits PKC, whereas psychosine strongly inhibits PKC (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Systematic chemical analysis of cationic lipids from lower phase of Folch's partition of bovine brain revealed the following interesting points: (i) Although it was reported to be absent from human brain (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), psychosine was clearly detectable in bovine brain white matter (Fig. 1; Table I); (ii) PLPS A and B, originally found in human brain white matter, were also detected in bovine brain, where their levels were, respectively, 12 and 18 times lower than in human (Table I); (iii) a novel GSL, Px, was isolated and characterized as a major plasmal conjugate in bovine brain. Whether Px occurs in human brain remains to be determined.The large difference in PLPS level between human and bovine brain, and its association with neuritogenesis, raises the interesting question of whether this compound is involved in neuronal communication, which may be qualitatively much higher in human brain. Although the structure of Px is distinct from that of PLPS in that Px contains glycerol, they have in common the structure of psychosine with plasmal conjugate. An important topic for future study is how Px affects signal transduction in neuronal cells.Psychosine is neurotoxic and strongly inhibits brain PKC activity. Its PKC-inhibitory effect is much stronger than that of PLPS (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was reported to be absent in normal human brain, psychosine is detectable in brains of patients with sphingolipidosis (e.g. Krabbe's disease) (37Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 38Igarashi Y. Nojiri H. Hanai N. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 521-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An interesting question is whether conversion of psychosine to PLPS or to Px may result in entirely different neuronal signaling, because PLPS is neurotrophic whereas psychosine is neurotoxic. Cationic lipids are rare in animal cells and tissues (see “Discussion”). PLPS has the novel effect of inducing signal transduction in neuronal cells, particularly neuritogenesis in PC12 cells without addition of nerve growth factor; i.e. PLPS mimics the effect of nerve growth factor (7Sakakura C.

Another example is activation by PLPS of Trk A tyrosine kinase in PC12 cells, leading to enhancement of mitogen-activated protein kinase. This mimics the effect of nerve growth factor, because withdrawal of PLPS induces apoptosis (7Sakakura C. Igarashi Y. Anand J.K. Sadozai K.K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 946-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PLPS weakly inhibits PKC, whereas psychosine strongly inhibits PKC (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Systematic chemical analysis of cationic lipids from lower phase of Folch's partition of bovine brain revealed the following interesting points: (i) Although it was reported to be absent from human brain (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), psychosine was clearly detectable in bovine brain white matter (Fig. 1; Table I); (ii) PLPS A and B, originally found in human brain white matter, were also detected in bovine brain, where their levels were, respectively, 12 and 18 times lower than in human (Table I); (iii) a novel GSL, Px, was isolated and characterized as a major plasmal conjugate in bovine brain. Whether Px occurs in human brain remains to be determined.The large difference in PLPS level between human and bovine brain, and its association with neuritogenesis, raises the interesting question of whether this compound is involved in neuronal communication, which may be qualitatively much higher in human brain. Although the structure of Px is distinct from that of PLPS in that Px contains glycerol, they have in common the structure of psychosine with plasmal conjugate. An important topic for future study is how Px affects signal transduction in neuronal cells.Psychosine is neurotoxic and strongly inhibits brain PKC activity. Its PKC-inhibitory effect is much stronger than that of PLPS (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it was reported to be absent in normal human brain, psychosine is detectable in brains of patients with sphingolipidosis (e.g. Krabbe's disease) (37Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 38Igarashi Y. Nojiri H. Hanai N. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 179: 521-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An interesting question is whether conversion of psychosine to PLPS or to Px may result in entirely different neuronal signaling, because PLPS is neurotrophic whereas psychosine is neurotoxic. The present study indicates the presence of a significant quantity of a cationic GSL with plasmal conjugate, Px, having highly novel structure, in white matter of bovine brain. Px is characterized by properties similar to those of PLPS A and B, i.e. (i) Px and PLPS A and B are co-eluted with the same solvent (ionic strength 0.20–0.23 m triethylamine in methanol) and separated from psychosine; (ii) TLC behavior similar to that of PLPS in basic, neutral, and acidic solvents; (iii) both Px and PLPS yield psychosine and plasmal on weak acid hydrolysis. On the other hand, Px has certain properties distinct from those of PLPS: (i) Px has an additional polar group showing much slower TLC mobility than PLPS in all solvents tested. (ii) Preliminary negative-ion LSIMS of Px in comparison to PLPS A and B clearly indicated that Px has the higher molecular mass. Px had a molecular mass 92 Da higher in deprotonated molecules [M−H]− than that of PLPS; this difference in molecular mass corresponds to glycerol. (iii) Px has only one 6-O-substitution, whereas PLPS A has 3,4-di-O-substitution, and PLPS B has 4,6-di-O-substitution on methylation analysis. (iv) The sequence of the components and molecular species of aldehyde are characterized as a glycerol-O-aldehyde(16:0, 18:1, and 18:0)-O-Hex-Sph, by LSIMS and ESIMS of native and methylated compounds. (v) The structure was established unambiguously as a glycerol derivative of PLPS by 1H and 13C NMR. The novelty of the Px structure lies in the mode of plasmal conjugation, i.e. the way that O-plasmal conjugate is linked at C1 at two primary hydroxyl groups at glycerol and galactose. The glycerol residue may interact with galactosyl residue to achieve steric stability, such that axes of two aliphatic chains, sphingosine and plasmal, are oriented in parallel regardless of the C1 stereoisomer of plasmal. A tentative minimum energy conformational model is shown in Fig. 4. No similar structure has been observed previously in any plasmal conjugated compound. The most common plasmal conjugates are based on O-vinyl ether,i.e. O-alk-1-enyl group linked to one of the hydroxyls of glycerophosphoethanolamine or glycerophosphocholine, as observed typically in plasmalogen (for review see Refs. 27Hanahan D.J. Lipide Chemistry. J. Wiley & Sons, New York1960: 92-105Google Scholar, 28Debuch H. Seng P. Snyder F. Ether lipids: Chemistry and Biology. Academic Press, New York1972: 1-24Google Scholar). Another group of plasmal conjugates is based on cyclic acetal linked to a vicinal dihydroxyl group of galactosyl residue linked to Sph, ceramide, or diglyceride (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Hakomori S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5335-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Yachida Y. Kashiwaga M. Mikami T. Tsuchihashi K. Daino T. Akino T. Gasa S. J.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We term this compound with novel structure “glyceroplasmalopsychosine.” The biosynthetic mechanism of either O-cyclic acetal or novel acetal, as now found in Px, is totally unknown at this time. In contrast, biosynthesis of O-alk-1-enyl structure as found in plasmalogen was well established through the 1-alkyl desaturase system, a microsomal mixed-function oxidase (29Snyder F. Lee T. Wykle R.L. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. Vol. 2, Biosynthesis and Metabolism. 2nd. Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 1-58Google Scholar). Release of free fatty aldehyde (plasmal) appears to be a prerequisite for synthesis ofO-acetal conjugates; however, the mechanism for this is still ambiguous. Three biochemical routes have been proposed: (i) action of acyl-CoA reductases in the presence of NADPH; (ii) oxidative cleavage of alkyl glyceride by alkyl mono-oxygenase (tetrahydropterine; Pte-H4-dependent); (iii) specific hydrolase for plasmalogen (“plasmalogenase”) capable of hydrolyzing O-alk-1-enyl group (30Snyder F. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. Elsevier, Amsterdam1996: 183-210Google Scholar). However, released fatty aldehyde is transient and immediately converted to fatty alcohol or fatty acid, and it is perhaps utilized for O-acetal conjugation. The entire process may take place in the microsomal membrane. Although the mechanism of O-plasmal conjugate formation is unknown, it may be an enzymatic reaction coupled with either plasmal-forming reaction i, ii, or iii as above. This concept is supported by the following observations: (i) Specificity of plasmal conjugate always occurs at β-galactosyl but not other sugar residues (3Nudelman E.D. Levery S.B. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11007-11016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Levery S.B. Nudelman E.D. Hakomori S.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2271-2278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such specificity cannot be associated with non-enzymatic reaction. (ii) Plasmal conjugate as plasmalocerebroside was detectable by MALDI-TOF of sphingolipid extract from as little as 200 mg of wet weight of Eker rat brain white matter but not from gray matter extract of the same brain. The level of plasmalocerebroside was many times higher in brain from Eker rats with hereditary renal carcinoma (31Taketomi T. Hara A. Uemura K. Sugiyama E. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This finding indicates that biosynthesis of acetal conjugates is enhanced in pathological processes and rules out the possibility that they are formed during the isolation procedure. (iii) The yield of Px from bovine brain white matter is consistent regardless of amount of material used or whether old (long-term frozen) versus fresh samples are used, i.e. 0.55–0.60 μmol per kg. (iv) The yield of PLPS from human brain is ∼10× higher than that from bovine brain, as found in both our previous and present studies. This indicates that a consistent level of plasmal conjugate is synthesized in brain and that the level varies depending on species. (v) No Px or PLPS was yielded when a mixture of plasmal and psychosine was incubated with or without glycerol for various durations, and the yield of PLPS was the same as that directly from the homogenate when human brain white matter homogenate was incubated with plasmal and psychosine or with phosphatidylethanolamine containing plasmalogen. NMR data indicate that two stereoisomers with regard to the asymmetric C1 carbon of plasmal in Px are detected in a ratio of ∼1:1, whereas those of PLPS are found exclusively in only one form (“endo type”). This may reflect a difference in stability of plasmal linkage in these two compounds, i.e. the linkage in Px is much more unstable than that in PLPS (see under “Experimental Procedures”: “Determination of Lipids Containing Aldehyde Using Schiff's Reagent”). Anomeric conversion of sugars as detected by mutarotation depends highly on stability of glycosidic linkage; e.g. N-glycosides are in general much more unstable thanO-glycosides, if the same sugar is linked to a similar aglycon. Susceptibility of mutarotation is higher in unstableN-linked structures than in O-linked structures. It is possible that the ratio of Px stereoisomers A and B is different in nascent product compared with those after isolation, although this is difficult to demonstrate at this time. In stereoisomers A and B, general conformational structure is very similar in terms of axes of two aliphatic chains and location of sugars. In general, lipids can be classified as acidic, neutral, zwitterionic, or cationic based on their ionic properties. Positive ionic properties of cationic lipids (which include psychosine and other lyso-GSLs, Sph, and dimethyl-Sph) are ascribable to the amino group of Sph. Cationic lipids having free Sph amino group, though a minor component, modulate activity of growth factor receptor kinase, protein kinase C, or other membrane-bound signal transducer molecules located at upstream regions of signal transduction pathways. This event leads to up- or down-regulation of key molecules, located downstream, which control transcription. For example, Sph and dimethyl-Sph inhibit PKC (32Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Toyokuni T.
