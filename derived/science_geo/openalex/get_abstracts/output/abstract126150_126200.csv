https://openalex.org/W2165910525,"The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily consists of approximately 10 characterized members of human proteins. We have identified a new member of the TNFR superfamily, TR2, from a search of an expressed sequence tag data base. cDNA cloning and Northern blot hybridization demonstrated multiple mRNA species, of which a 1.7-kilobase form was most abundant. However, TR2 is encoded by a single gene which, maps to chromosome 1p36.22–36.3, in the same region as several other members of the TNFR superfamily. The most abundant TR2 open reading frame encodes a 283-amino acid single transmembrane protein with a 36-residue signal sequence, two perfect and two imperfect TNFR-like cysteine-rich domains, and a short cytoplasmic tail with some similarity to 4–1BB and CD40. TR2 mRNA is expressed in multiple human tissues and cell lines and shows a constitutive and relatively high expression in peripheral blood T cells, B cells, and monocytes. A TR2-Fc fusion protein inhibited a mixed lymphocyte reaction-mediated proliferation suggesting that the receptor and/or its ligand play a role in T cell stimulation.

Barclay A.N. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 220-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TNFR-I complexed with its ligand showed that a cysteine-rich motif (TNFR domain) was composed of three elongated strands of residues held together by a twisted ladder of disulfide bonds (2Banner D.W.

These receptors contain a hinge-like region immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain, characterized by a lack of cysteine residues and a high proportion of serine, threonine, and proline, which are likely to be glycosylated with O-linked sugars. A cytoplasmic part of these molecules shows limited sequence similarities, a finding that may be the basis for diverse cellular signaling. At present, the members identified from human cells include CD40 (3Banchereau J. Bazan F. Blanchard D. Briere F. Galizzi J.P. van Kooten C. Liu Y.-J. Rousset F. Saeland S. Annu. Rev.

Because of their biological significance and the diverse membership of this superfamily, we predicted that there would be further members of the superfamily. By searching an EST data base, we identified a new member of the TNFR superfamily. We report here the initial characterization of the molecule called TR2. An EST cDNA data base, obtained from over 500 different cDNA libraries (29Adams M.D. Kelley J.M. Gocayne J.D. Dubnick M. Polymeropoulos M.H. Xiao H. Meril C.R. Wu A. Olde B. Moreno R.F.

Nature. 1992; 355: 632-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar), was screened for sequence homology with cysteine-rich motif of the TNFR superfamily, using the blastn and tblastn algorithms (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). One EST was identified in a human T cell line library, which showed significant sequence identity to TNFR-II at the amino acid level. This sequence was used to clone the missing 5′ end by RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using a 5′-RACE ends-ready cDNA from human leukocytes (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). This sequence matched three further ESTs (HTOBH42, HTOAU65, and HLHA49). Complete sequencing of these and other cDNAs indicated that they contained an identical open reading frame homologous to the TNFR superfamily, and it was named TR2. Analysis of several other ESTs and cDNAs indicated that some cDNAs had additional sequences inserted into the open reading frame identified above and might represent various partially spliced mRNAs. The myeloid and B cell lines studied represent cell types at different stages of the differentiation pathway. KG1a and PLB 985 (32Koeffler H.P. Billing R. Lusis A.J. Sparkes R. Golde D.W.

Blood. 1987; 70: 372-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Phillip Koeffler (UCLA School of Medicine), BJA-B was from Z Jonak (SmithKline Beecham), and TF 274, a stromal cell line exhibiting osteoblastic features, was generated from the bone marrow of a healthy male donor. 2K. B. Tan and Z. Jonak, unpublished data.All of the other cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Monocytes were prepared by differential centrifugation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and adhesion to tissue culture dish. CD19+, CD4+, and CD8+ were isolated from PBMC by immunomagnetic beads (Dynal, Lake Success, NY). Endothelial cells from human coronary artery were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Total RNA of adult tissues was purchased from CLONTECH or extracted from primary cells and cell lines with TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). 5–7.5 μg of total RNA was fractionated in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, as described (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar), and transferred quantitatively to Zeta-Probe nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) by vacuum blotting. The blots were prehybridized, hybridized with 32P-labeled Xho l/Eco RI fragment of TR2 or OX-40 probe, washed under high stringency conditions, and exposed to x-ray films. High molecular weight human DNA was digested with various restriction enzymes and fractionated in 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA was denatured, neutralized, and transferred to nylon membrane and hybridized to32P-labeled TR2 or its variant cDNA. The in situ hybridization and FISH detection of TR2 location in human chromosomes were performed as described previously (35Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 36Heng H.H.Q. Xiao H. Shi S.-M. Greenblatt J. Tsui L.-C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by taking photographs, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with a DAPI-banded chromosome (37Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma ( Berl .). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The 5′ portion of the TR2 containing the entire putative open reading frame of extracellular domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (38Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13496) Google Scholar). For correctly oriented cloning, a Hin dIII site on the 5′ end of the forward primer and a Bgl II site on the 5′ end of the reverse primer were created. The Fc portion of human IgG1was PCR-amplified from ARH-77 (ATCC) cell RNA and cloned in theSma I site of the pGem7 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The Fc fragment, including hinge, CH2, and CH3 domain sequences, contained a Bgl II site at its 5′ end and anXho I site at its 3′ end. TheHin dIII-Bgl II fragment of TR2 cDNA was inserted upstream of human IgG1Fc and an in-frame fusion was confirmed by sequencing. The TR2-Fc fragment was released by digesting the plasmid with Hin dIII-Xho I and cloned into pcDNA3 expression plasmid. The TR2-Fc plasmid, linearized with Pvu I, was transfected into NIH 3T3 by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. After selection in 400 μg/ml G418, neomycin-resistant colonies were picked and expanded. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with anti-human IgG1 and Northern analysis with 32P-labeled TR2 probe were used to select for clones that produce high levels of TR2-Fc in the supernatant. In some experiments, a slightly differently engineered TR2-Fc produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was used. The TR2-Fc was purified by protein G chromatography, and the amino acid sequence of the N terminus was determined by automatic peptide sequencer (ABI). The full-length TR2 cDNA was inserted into Hin dIII-Xho I sites of pcDNA 3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) was used to in vitro transcribe and translate the TR2 cDNA in pcDNA 3. The35S-labeled reaction product was fractionated on a 5–15% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and exposed to x-ray film. PBMC were isolated from three healthy adult volunteers by Ficoll gradient centrifugation at 400 × g for 30 min. PBMCs were recovered, washed in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 300 μg/ml l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml for two donors and to 2 × 105 cells/ml for the third donor. Fifty μl of each cell suspension was added to 96-well (round bottom) plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) together with 50 μl of TR2-Fc, IL-5R-Fc, anti-CD4 mAb, or control mAb. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 96 h. One μCi of [3H]methylthymidine (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) was then added for an additional 16 h. Cells were harvested, and radioactivity was counted. Fig.1 a shows the amino acid sequence of TR2 deduced from the longest open reading frame of one of the isolated cDNAs (HLHA49). Comparison with other sequenced cDNAs and with ESTs in the data base indicated potential allelic variants that resulted in amino acid changes at positions 17 (either Arg or Lys) and 41 (either Ser or Phe) of the protein sequence. The open reading frame encodes 283 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 30,417. The TR2 protein was expected to be a receptor. Therefore, the potential signal sequence and transmembrane domain were sought. A hydrophobic stretch of 23 amino acids toward the C terminus (amino acids 203–225) was assigned as a transmembrane domain, because it made a potentially single helical span (Fig.1 a), but the signal sequence was less obvious. The potential ectodomain of TR2 was expressed in NIH 3T3 and CHO cells as a Fc-fusion protein, and the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the recombinant TR2-Fc protein was determined in both cases. The N-terminal sequence of the processed mature TR2 started from amino acid 37, indicating that the first 36 amino acids constituted the signal sequence (Fig.1 a). As shown in Fig. 1 b, the in vitro translation product of TR2 cDNA was 32 kDa in molecular size. Since the first 36 amino acids constituted signal sequence, and its calculated molecular size was ∼4 kDa, the molecular size of the protein backbone of processed TR2 would be approximately 28 kDa. Recently, Montgomeryet al. (39Montgomery R.I. Warner M.S. Lum B.J. Spear P.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) published a herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) whose cDNA sequence was identical to TR2. They found that the transfected HVEM cDNA produced a 32–36-kDa protein. Since it is larger than the in vitro product, this suggests that the protein is modified posttranslationally. Two potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites are located at amino acid positions 110 and 173, as indicated in Fig. 1 a. Along with the other members of the TNFR family, TR2 contains the characteristic cysteine-rich motifs that have been shown by x-ray crystallography (2Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Jones W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.-J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar) to represent a repetitive structural unit. Fig.1 c shows the potential TNFR domain aligned among TR2, TNFR-I, TNFR-II, CD40, and 4–1BB. TR2 contained two perfect TNFR motifs and two imperfect ones. The TR2 cytoplasmic tail (TR-2 cy) does not contain the death domain seen in the Fas and TNFR-I intracellular domains, and appears to be more related to those of CD40cy and 4–1bbcy. Signals through 4–1BB and CD40 have been shown to be co-stimulatory to T cells and B cells, respectively (40Banchereau J. Rousset F. Nature. 1991; 353: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 41Hurtado J. Kim Y.-J. Kwon B.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2600-2609PubMed Google Scholar). A human tissue RNA blot was used to determine tissue distribution of TR2 mRNA expression. TR2 mRNA was detected in several tissues with a relatively high level in the lung, spleen, and thymus, but was not found in the brain, liver, or skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 a). TR2 was also expressed in monocytes, CD19+ B cells, and resting or PMA plus PHA-treated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. It was only weakly expressed in bone marrow and endothelial cells (Fig.2 b), although expression was observed in the hematopoietic cell line KG1a. For comparison, the tissue distribution of OX-40, another member of the TNFR superfamily, was examined. Unlike TR2, OX-40 was not detected in the tissues examined and was detected only in activated T cells and KG1a. Several cell lines were negative for TR2 expression, including TF274 (bone marrow stromal), MG63, TE85 (osteosarcomas), RL 95–2 (endometrial sarcoma), MCF-7, T-47D (breast cancer cells), BE, HT 29 (colon cancer cells), HTB-11, and IMR-32 (neuroblastomas), although TR2 was found in the rhabdosarcoma HTB-82 (data not shown). Several cell lines were examined for inducible TR2 expression. HL60, U937, and THP1, which belong to the myelomonocytic lineage, all increased TR2 expression in response to the differentiating agents PMA or Me2SO (Fig. 2 c). Increases in expression in response to these agents were also observed in KG1a and Jurkat cells. In contrast, PMA did not induce TR2 expression in MG63, but unexpectedly TNF-α did. In almost all cases, the predominant mRNA was approximately 1.7 kilobases in size, although several higher molecular weight species could be detected in some tissues (Fig. 2 a), and many cDNAs and ESTs that were sequenced contained insertions in the coding region indicative of partial splicing. The abundance of higher molecular weight mRNAs raises the possibility that TR2 may in part be regulated at the level of mRNA maturation. The FISH mapping procedure was applied to localize the TR2 gene to a specific human chromosomal region. The assignment of a hybridization signal to the short arm of chromosome 1 was obtained with the aid of DAP I banding. A total of 10 mitotic figures were photographed, one of which is shown in Fig.3 a. The double fluorescent signals are indicated on the schematic diagram of chromosome 1 as shown in Fig.3 b. This result indicated that the TR2 gene is located on the chromosome 1 region p36.2-p36.3. The TR2 position is in close proximity with CD30 (42Smith C.A. Gruss H.-J. Davis-Smith T. Anderson D.

Cell Genet. 1991; 57: 117-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that it evolved through a localized gene duplication event. Interestingly, all of these receptors have stimulatory phenotypes in T cells in response to cognate ligand binding, in contrast to Fas and TNFR-I, which stimulate apoptosis. This prompted us to test if TR2 might be involved in lymphocyte stimulation. To determine the potential involvement of cell surface TR2 with its ligand in lymphocyte proliferation, we examined allogeneic MLR proliferative responses. As shown in Fig. 4, a andb, when TR2-Fc was added to the culture, a significant reduction of maximal responses was observed (p < 0.05). The addition of TR2-Fc at 100 μg/ml inhibited the proliferation up to 53%. No significant inhibition of proliferation was observed with the control IL-5R-Fc. Surprisingly, at high concentrations (10–100 μg/ml) IL-5R-Fc was shown to enhance proliferation. The concentrations of TR2-Fc required to inhibit MLR proliferation (1–100 μg/ml) are comparable with those of CD40-Fc required for inhibition in other lymphocyte assays (47Grammer A.C. Bergman M.C.

An anti-CD4 mAb assayed simultaneously inhibited MLR-mediated proliferation up to 60%, whereas a control anti-IL-5 mAb failed to inhibit the proliferation. It is well known that a major component of the MLR proliferative response is T cell-dependent; hence, it would appear that inhibiting the interaction of TR2 with its ligand prevents optimal T lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Hence, we have identified an additional member of the TNFR superfamily that either plays a direct role in T cell stimulation or binds to a ligand which can stimulate T cell proliferation through one or more receptors, which may include TR2. We are currently trying to identify this ligand to which TR2 binds to clarify its role."

We have used a constitutively active PI 3-kinase to identify IL-2-mediated signal transduction pathways directly regulated by PI 3-kinase in lymphoid cells. The serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt can act as a powerful oncogene in T cells, but its positioning in normal T cell responses has not been explored. Herein, we demonstrate that PKB is activated by IL-2 in a PI 3-kinase-dependent fashion. Importantly, PI 3-kinase signals are sufficient for PKB activation in IL-2-dependent T cells, and PKB is a target for PI 3-kinase signals in IL-2 activation pathways. The present study establishes also that PI 3-kinase signals or PKB signals are sufficient for activation of p70 S6 kinase in T cells. PI 3-kinase can contribute to, but is not sufficient for, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) and Erk effector pathways. Therefore, PI 3-kinase is a selective regulator of serine/threonine kinase signal transduction pathways in T lymphocytes, and this enzyme provides a crucial link between the interleukin-2 receptor, the protooncogene PKB, and p70 S6 kinase.

PI 3-kinase can contribute to, but is not sufficient for, activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erks) and Erk effector pathways. Therefore, PI 3-kinase is a selective regulator of serine/threonine kinase signal transduction pathways in T lymphocytes, and this enzyme provides a crucial link between the interleukin-2 receptor, the protooncogene PKB, and p70 S6 kinase.

PI 3-kinase is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the D-3 hydroxyl of themyo-inositol ring generating PI 3-phosphate, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (13Panayotou G.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The form of PI 3-kinase involved in protein-tyrosine kinase-dependent receptor signal transduction comprises a regulatory 85-kDa subunit that contains two Src homology 2 domains and at its N terminus one Src homology 3 domain and a catalytic 110-kDa subunit. Following IL-2R stimulation, several mechanisms have been proposed to recruit PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane, where its cellular substrate PI 4,5-bisphosphate is located: engagement of the IL-2R leads to binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to tyrosine 392 in the IL-2R β-chain (15Truitt K.E. Mills G.B. Turck C.W. Imboden J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5937-5943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); in addition, interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulation results in the interaction of PI 3-kinase with the Src family kinases Fyn (16Karnitz L. Sutor S. Abraham R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1799-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Lck (17Taichman R. Merida I. Torigoe T. Gaulton G.N. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20031-20036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of PI 3-kinase is a response that IL-2 shares with other cytokines that control lymphoid cell growth and development such as IL-4 and IL-7 (18Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P.

Immunol. 1994; 24: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is also clear that PI 3-kinase activation is necessary for the growth- and differentiation-inducing properties of these cytokines (20Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J.K. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Mills G.B. Schmandt R. Gibson S. Leung B. Hill M. May C. Shi Y.F. Branch D.R. Radvanyi L.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1924-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, despite the pivotal role of PI 3-kinase in lymphoid cells, there is only a preliminary and incomplete understanding of the targets for this enzyme in the mitogenic signaling pathways regulated by the hematopoietin family of cytokines. To date, the identification of biochemical targets for PI 3-kinase in T cells stems mainly from studies employing the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or the LY294002 compound (10Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J.K. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hence, IL-2 activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk is sensitive to wortmannin (10Karnitz L.M. Burns L.A. Sutor S.L. Blenis J. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3049-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Similarly, IL-2 activation of the serine/threonine kinase p70 S6 kinase (p70S6k) is prevented by these PI 3-kinase inhibitors (20Monfar M. Lemon K.P. Grammer T.C. Cheatham L. Chung J.K. Vlahos C.J. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-2 activation of p70S6k is impeded by the immunosupressant rapamycin, which targets another member of the PI 3-kinase family of enzymes, Frap (for FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein) also termed “mammalian target of rapamycin” (mTor) (24Proud C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,25Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Observations that wortmannin and rapamycin have identical inhibitory effects on IL-2 activation of p70S6k generated a model for the p70S6k signaling pathway in which PI 3-kinase acts as an upstream regulator of Frap (24Proud C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 181-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 25Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, this model has been challenged by a recent study showing that the action of Frap is directly inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (26Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). These results raise the issue of whether PI 3-kinase itself has any upstream regulatory role in p70S6k activation in T lymphocytes. Similar caution must be applied to interpretations of data involving PI 3-kinase in Erk activation in T cells. In this context, expression of an active PI 3-kinase is sufficient for Erk activation in Xenopus oocytes (27Hu Q. Klippel A. Muslin A.J. Fantl W.J. Williams L.T. Science. 1995; 268: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), but it would be fallacious to extrapolate data obtained inXenopus cells to T cells, since the role of PI 3-kinase as an upstream regulator of kinase pathways can vary depending on the cell system; to this end, PI 3-kinase signals did not stimulate Erk activity in a variety of fibroblasts and in a monoblast cell line (28Klippel A.

Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether PI 3-kinase signals are sufficient to stimulate p70S6k or Erk activation in T cells awaits analysis. We and others have recently reported that targeting the catalytic p110 subunit of PI 3-kinase to the plasma membrane generates a constitutively active enzyme that induces cellular accumulation of D-3 phosphoinositides (28Klippel A.

Biol. 1997; 7: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A constitutively active PI 3-kinase finally allows assessment of the relative contribution of PI 3-kinase-derived signals to a certain effector pathway, in particular whether PI 3-kinase activation is sufficient to promote a specific cellular response. In the present study, we have used a membrane-localized p110 construct, rCD2p110, that induces accumulation of cellular levels of PI 3,4-bisphosphate and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (29Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a tool to explore the regulation of serine/threonine kinase pathways by PI 3-kinase in T lymphocytes. We show that activation of PI 3-kinase is sufficient to stimulate p70S6k activity, although PI 3-kinase signals were not sufficient to induce activation of the MAP kinase Erk2 in T cells. The present study also characterizes a previously unrecognized IL-2-mediated signal transduction pathway in T cells that involves the serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB) also known as c-Akt or Rac protein kinase (32Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar, 33Franke F.T. Yang S. Chan O.T. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison K.D. Kalpan R.D. Tsichlis N.P.

A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). PKB was originally identified as the cellular homologue of the directly transforming oncogene of the murine retrovirus AKT8, which causes thymic lymphomas (35Staal S.P. Hartley J.W. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1259-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that PKB is rapidly activated by IL-2 via a wortmannin- and LY294002-sensitive but rapamycin-insensitive pathway. PI 3-kinase signals alone were sufficient to activate PKB in T cells, and expression of a constitutively active PKB could stimulate the activity of p70S6k. Therefore, PI 3-kinase is a selective regulator of serine/threonine kinase signal transduction pathways in T lymphocytes, and this enzyme is an upstream regulator of the IL-2-activated kinases PKB and p70S6k.

For IL-2 activation assays of endogenous proteins, Kit225 cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline A to remove the IL-2 and cultured further in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum in the absence of rIL-2 for 48–72 h prior to IL-2 activation assays. When Kit225 cells were transfected, cells were treated as above but only deprived of rIL-2 for 24 h prior to transfection. Kit225 cells were transfected by electroporation with 20–40 μg of plasmid DNA. The amounts of plasmid DNA were kept constant per cuvette by adding vector plasmid. Kit225 cells (1.5 × 107cells/0.625 ml) were pulsed at 320 V and 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The amounts of plasmid used were as follows (unless indicated otherwise): 7.5 μg of HA-p70S6k; 12.5 μg of HA-PKB; 10 μg of HA-Erk2; 20 μg of the plasmid pEF empty, rCD2p110, rCD2p110-R/P, Ha-v-ras, V12Rac, V12Cdc42, gagPKB, or rCD2p85; 7.5 μg of 2lexoptk.CAT; and 15 μg of pEFNlex.Elk-1 or pMLVNlex.C2. For gene reporter assays, cells were stimulated as indicated 2–4 h after transfection. Cells were collected 14–18 h after transfection. After stimulations as indicated, Kit225 cells were lysed in lysis buffer 1 (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 7.5 mmPPi, 15 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Cell extracts corresponding to 3 × 106 cell equivalents (nontransfected cells) or 1.5 × 106 live cell equivalents (transfected cells) were used for each immunoprecipitation. Postnuclear lysates were precleared with protein A cell suspension (Sigma) prior to incubation with 2 μg of 12CA5 mAbs or, for endogenous proteins, 1 μg of M5 Abs. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) or, when M5 Abs were used, with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer 1 and once in p70S6k assay buffer (50 mm Mops, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) and assayed as described (37Ming X.-F. Burgering B.M.T. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Bos J.L. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Nature. 1994; 371: 426-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) using S6 as a substrate (a gift from G. Thomas). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The lower part of the gel was dried, and 32P-labeled S6 proteins were detected by autoradiography. The levels of p70S6k protein in each immunoprecipitate were assessed by transferring the proteins in the upper part of the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and performing Western blot analysis with 12CA5 mAbs or M1 Abs using the ECL detection system (Amersham). If the p70S6k protein levels in the immunoprecipitate were not equal, activities were normalized for p70S6k expression levels by quantitation of Western blots probed with M1 Abs followed by125I-conjugated protein A (Amersham). Quantitation of incorporated 32P into S6 or of bound125I-conjugated protein A was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To test for effector protein expression in transfected cells, postnuclear cell extracts corresponding to 3 × 106 cell equivalents of the same extract as above were analyzed by Western blotting as described (44Reif K. Gout I. Waterfield M.D. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10780-10788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using 9E10, Ox34, or specific Abs. Cells were treated as for p70S6k assays except that lysis buffer 2 (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmNa3VO4) was used to lyse cells. To immunoprecipitate endogenous PKB, 2 μg of Rac-PK-CT Abs were used. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer 2, twice in high salt wash buffer (500 mm LiCl, 100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), and once in PKB assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 15 μl of PKB reaction buffer containing 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm ATP, 7.3 mm MgCl2, 730 μm dithiothreitol, 500 nm protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), 40 mmTris, pH 7.5, and 2.5 μg of histone 2B (H2B) (Boehringer Mannheim). After 30 min at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was treated as for p70S6k assays. To detect PKB proteins, Western blot analysis was performed with Rac-PK-CT Abs. Cells and cell extracts were processed as for p70S6k assays. HA-tagged Erk2 was immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 mAbs. Precipitated immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer 1 and once with Erk wash buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of Erk reaction buffer containing 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 500 nm protein kinase inhibitor, 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 15 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma). After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was treated as for p70S6k assays. To detect Erk proteins, Western blot analysis was performed with 12CA5 mAbs as primary Ab, rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary Ab, and125I-conjugated protein A. Fourteen to 16 h after inductions, as indicated, Kit225 T cells were harvested and cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.65% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl). Gene expression assays were carried out as described (45Woodrow M. Clipstone N.A. Cantrell D. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The data are presented as percentage of conversion. For our studies, we used the well characterized human IL-2-dependent T cell line Kit225. The data in Fig.1 A show that p70S6k activity is low in quiescent rIL-2-deprived Kit225 cells but can be rapidly stimulated by rIL-2. The activity of p70S6k is increased in response to phorbol esters that stimulate protein kinase C (PKC) (Fig. 1 A). We asked whether PI 3-kinase signals could substitute for IL-2 in inducing p70S6k activity. We have shown recently that plasma membrane targeting of p110, the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, generates an enzyme that is constitutively active in vivo (29Reif K. Nobes C.D. Thomas G. Hall A. Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our membrane-targeted active PI 3-kinase construct comprises a chimera of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the rCD2 antigen fused to the p110α catalytic domain of PI 3-kinase, rCD2p110. As a control, we used a rCD2p110 molecule that contained in the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase an inactivating point mutation (R1130P) in the ATP binding site (46Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) that abolishes its in vivo and in vitro lipid kinase activity, rCD2p110-R/P. To assess the effects of PI 3-kinase signals on p70S6k activity, rIL-2-starved Kit225 cells were co-transfected with HA epitope-tagged p70S6k and rCD2p110. Cell surface expression of the rCD2p110 chimera was confirmed by flow cytometric immunofluorescence analysis with rCD2 mAbs (data not shown). The HA-tagged p70S6k was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected cells and assayed for its ability to phosphorylate S6 ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1 B). Expression of the active PI 3-kinase, rCD2p110, resulted in constitutive IL-2-independent p70S6k activation (Fig. 1 B). p70S6k was not constitutively activated in cells expressing “kinase-dead” rCD2p110-R/P, confirming that the p70S6k activation requires the kinase activity of the p110 subunit (Fig.1 C). The expression of rCD2p110-R/P was noted in some experiments to suppress rIL-2 inducibility of p70S6k, indicating that this chimera may be an inhibitory mutant of PI 3-kinase pathways. PKB can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor receptor and has been identified as a target of PI 3-kinase in fibroblasts (28Klippel A. Reinhard C.

In particular, although PKB can become oncogenic and initiate thymic tumors, its regulation and significance for normal T cell growth processes is not known. Since cytokine receptors have essential functions in the development and maintenance of the hematopoietic system, we were interested to assess whether members of the hematopoietin receptor family, such as the prototypical IL-2R, regulate PKB. To examine whether IL-2 activates PKB, immunoprecipitates of this kinase were prepared from rIL-2-deprived and rIL-2-activated Kit225 cells and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using H2B as a substrate. The data in Fig. 2 A show that IL-2 induced a rapid activation of PKB. A 2–3-fold increase in enzyme activity over basal levels was sustained for more than 60 min in response to rIL-2. PKB activity is regulated by phosphorylation as indicated by the reduced electrophoretic mobility of PKB isolated from rIL-2-activated cells (Fig. 2 A). PKB activity was not induced by exposure of Kit225 cells to phorbol esters that activate PKC (Fig. 2 A). The data in Fig. 2 B show the failure of rIL-2 to stimulate PKB in cells pretreated with LY294002 or wortmannin, two well characterized PI 3-kinase inhibitors that bind to the ATP or lipid binding sites on the p110 catalytic subunit, respectively. These inhibitors also prevent the autokinase activity of Frap/mTor (26Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J., J.C. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5256-5267Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), a member of the PI 3-kinase family (47Abraham A.T. Curr. Opin.

We have now identified a novel synaptotagmin, synaptotagmin XI, that is highly expressed in brain and at lower levels in other tissues. Like other synaptotagmins, synaptotagmin XI has a single transmembrane region and two cytoplasmic C2-domains but is most closely related to synaptotagmin IV with which it forms a new subclass of synaptotagmins. The first C2-domain of synaptotagmin I (the C2A-domain) binds phospholipids as a function of Ca2+ and contains a Ca2+-binding site, the C2-motif, that binds at least two Ca2+ ions via five aspartate residues and is conserved in most C2-domains (Shao, X., Davletov, B., Sutton, B., Südhof, T. C., Rizo, J. R. (1996) Science 273, 248–253). In the C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI, however, one of the five Ca2+-binding aspartates in the C2-motif is substituted for a serine, suggesting that these C2-domains do not bind Ca2+. To test this, we produced recombinant C2A-domains from synaptotagmins IV and XI with either wild type serine or mutant aspartate in the C2-motif. Circular dichroism showed that Ca2+stabilizes both mutant but not wild type C2-domains against temperature-induced denaturation, indicating that the mutations restore Ca2+-binding to the wild type C2-domains. Furthermore, wild type C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI exhibited no Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, whereas mutant C2A-domains bound phospholipids as a function of Ca2+ similarly to wild type synaptotagmin I. These experiments suggest that a class of synaptotagmins was selected during evolution in which the Ca2+-binding site of the C2A-domain was inactivated by a single point mutation. Thus, synaptotagmins must have Ca2+-independent functions as well as Ca2+-dependent functions that are selectively maintained in distinct members of this gene family.

Synaptotagmins represent a large protein family with at least ten genes that probably function in membrane traffic (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J.

All synaptotagmins are characterized by a single N-terminal transmembrane region and two cytoplasmic C2-domains followed by a short conserved C terminus. Synaptotagmins I and II probably serve as Ca2+ sensors in fast Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (10Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin III may have a distinct function at the synapse, possibly in mediating the slow component of Ca2+-dependent release (12Li C. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), while the other synaptotagmins are thought to function in related neuronal and nonneuronal membrane trafficking reactions (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, the total number of synaptotagmins and their localizations and functions are unknown. The current study was initiated to determine if there are additional synaptotagmins in mammals that could be grouped into subclasses with distinct properties. Most synaptotagmins are Ca2+-binding proteins (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In synaptotagmin I, the first C2-domain (C2A-domain) binds to phospholipids and syntaxin as a function of Ca2+ (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 13Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second C2-domain mediates the Ca2+-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to itself, leading to Ca2+-dependent homomultimers (14Sugita S. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1262-1265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5844-5849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A crystal structure of the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I revealed that it represents a compact domain composed of eight β-strands forming two β-sheets (16Sutton B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Three sequence loops emerge from the top, and four from the bottom of the domain. Ca2+binding to the C2A-domain stabilizes it (17Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28547-28550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but does not induce a major conformational change (18Shao X. Li C. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Detailed studies of Ca2+ binding to the C2A-domain by NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that it binds at least two Ca2+ions at a site formed by two of the top three loops (19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Ca2+ is coordinated by five aspartate residues, three of which coordinate both Ca2+ ions. Thus the C2-domain contains an unusual Ca2+-binding site, designated the C2-motif, that is formed by aspartate residues on discontinuous sequence loops. More than 50 C2-domain sequences are present in the data banks, suggesting that it is a widespread domain (20Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The C2-motif is conserved in many of these C2-domains that are thus likely to bind Ca2+similarly to the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I. In agreement with the binding of at least two Ca2+ ions to the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I, Ca2+cooperatively activates phospholipid binding to native synaptotagmin I (12Li C.

Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) and to recombinant C2A-domain (13Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid binding is promiscuous and only requires negatively charged phospholipids (12Li C. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24898-24902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to phospholipids, C2A-domains bind syntaxin as a function of Ca2+but with distinct Ca2+ affinities that suggest different functions in membrane traffic (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Although most C2A-domains from synaptotagmins contain the C2-motif and bind phospholipids as a function of Ca2+, those of synaptotagmins IV and VIII do not (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin VIII contains many changes in the sequences of the Ca2+-binding loops, indicating that the C2-motif is not formed in this synaptotagmin. By contrast, the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV is very similar to that of the other synaptotagmins and contains all residues of the C2-motif except that one of the five Ca2+-coordinating aspartates is substituted for a serine. In this study, we now describe the identification of a novel synaptotagmin, synaptotagmin XI, that is highly homologous to synaptotagmin IV and also contains the aspartate to serine substitution in the C2-motif. Since the changed aspartate coordinates both Ca2+ ions in the C2-motif, the substitution is predicted to abolish Ca2+ binding, and indeed no Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding was observed with standard liposomes for the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV (11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition to participating in Ca2+-dependent interactions, C2-domains from synaptotagmins also exhibit Ca2+-independent activities. For example, the second C2-domain of all synaptotagmins tested binds AP2, a clathrin adaptor protein complex involved in endocytosis (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 22Zhang J.Z. Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Since this and other Ca2+-independent interactions of C2-domains are not regulated, it is difficult to determine if they are physiologically relevant. Data showing that some C2-domains do not exhibit Ca2+-dependent interactions do not actually prove that these C2-domains are indeed Ca2+-independent (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Such a demonstration could be obtained, however, if reversal of an inactivating amino acid substitution restored Ca2+-dependent properties. Indeed, the notion that the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV is a Ca2+-independent domain was challenged by a report of Ca2+-dependent binding of the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV to phospholipids consisting of 100% PS 1The abbreviations used are: PSphosphatidylserineESTexpressed, sequence tagGSTglutathione S-transferasePCphosphatidylcholinePCRpolymerase chain reaction (23Fukuda M.

It is thus important to establish if synaptotagmins IV and XI are Ca2+-independent because this would support a general function for C2-domains in Ca2+-independent reactions. Therefore, a further goal of the current study was to determine if the C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI are selectively inactivated in evolution as Ca2+-binding modules by a single substitution, or if these C2-domains contain additional changes that differentiate them from other synaptotagmins. Our data reveal that synaptotagmins IV and XI contain a single point mutation that selectively abolishes Ca2+binding but leaves other properties of the C2-domain intact. phosphatidylserine expressed, sequence tag glutathione S-transferase phosphatidylcholine polymerase chain reaction Searches of GenBank with a consensus sequence from the C-terminal domain of synaptotagmins and double C2-domain proteins (1Südhof T.C.

Positive clones were sequenced, with two clones containing the entire coding region as judged by comparison with the sequence of synaptotagmin IV and the presence of in-frame stop codons in the longest clone. The cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AF000423). The C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI were subcloned into pGEX-KG (25Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal.

Recombinant GST-fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose. Proteins were used for phospholipid binding measurements immobilized on glutathione-agarose without elution. For the CD studies, the C2A-domains were cleaved from the GST-fusion proteins on the column by thrombin (0.25 mg/ml of resin at room temperature for 3 h) and further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex-75 FPLC column. Phospholipids (3.5 mg total, obtained from Avanti Poalr Lipids) were dissolved in chloroform, mixed in the indicated weight ratios with a trace amount of3H-labeled PC (<0.01% total; Amersham), and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Dried lipids were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 0.1 m NaCl (buffer A) by vigorous shaking for 1 min. Suspensions were sonicated for 20 s in a Branson probe sonicator (model 450) at an intensity setting of 5 and centrifuged for 20 min at approximately 5,000 × g to remove aggregates. The standard binding assay contained 25 μg of recombinant protein with 1 μg of protein/μl wet glutathione beads.

Approximately 8 μmC2A-domain in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl and 0.5 mm EGTA with or without 5.5 mm CaCl2 were used. Thermal denaturation was monitored by changes in CD absorption at 217 nm from 25 to 95 °C in 1 °C steps. The fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was calculated as (Iobs -If)/(Iu -If), where Iobs is the observed signal intensity and Iu andIf are the signal intensities of the unfolded and folded states, respectively. Iu andIf were obtained by extrapolation of the linear regions of the unfolding curves. Amounts of proteins used were standardized based on Coomassie Blue stained SDS-gels and UV absorption at 280 nm. RNA blotting experiments were performed at high stringency with blots loaded with poly(A)+-enriched RNA purchased fromCLONTECH as described previously (24Ichtchenko K. Hata Y. Nguyen T. Ullrich B.

At the C terminus, synaptotagmins and other double C2-domain proteins contain a unique conserved domain after the second C2-domain (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Searches of GenBankTM with a consensus sequence derived from the C-terminal domain identified a human EST sequence (accession numberD38522) from a myeloblast cell line that was related to, but distinct from, all currently known synaptotagmins and other double C2-domain proteins. To determine if a homologue of this EST was present in rat brain, we synthesized PCR primers based on the human sequence and amplified a corresponding fragment from rat brain total cDNA. A single band of the correct size was obtained that was confirmed by sequencing to correspond to the rat homologue of the human EST sequence (data not shown). Using the PCR product as a probe, we isolated multiple independent cDNA clones from a rat brain cDNA library. Two of the cDNA clones were found to contain the complete coding region, and the sequence of the entire protein was assembled from the sequences of the cDNA clones (Fig. 1). The amino acid sequence translated from the cDNA sequence identifies the new double C2-domain protein as a synaptotagmin based on the criteria established for this protein family (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). It has no signal sequence, contains a single transmembrane region with multiple neighboring cysteines, has two C2-domains, and has a short C-terminal sequence homologous to the C-terminal domains of other double C2-domain proteins (Fig. 1). In continuation of the naming of other members of this protein family, we named this protein synaptotagmin XI. To learn which rat tissues express synaptotagmin XI, we performed an RNA blot analysis. High levels of synaptotagmin XI mRNA were observed in brain (Fig.2). In addition, low levels of the mRNA could be detected in almost all tissues tested, suggesting that synaptotagmin XI, similar to synaptotagmins IV, VI, and VII (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), is not brain-specific but ubiquitously expressed in low abundance. With the new synaptotagmin described here, synaptotagmins now constitute a family of 11 proteins (2Perin M.S. Fried V. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C.

Although all synaptotagmins are composed of similar domains, their N-terminal regions (intravesicular sequence, transmembrane region, and linker between the transmembrane region and the C2A-domain) exhibit little similarity to each other except for pairwise similarities between synaptotagmins I and II and between III and VI (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). By contrast, the C-terminal domains (the two C2-domains and the short C-terminal domain) are highly homologous between all synaptotagmins. Sequence analysis of synaptotagmin XI demonstrates that it is most closely related to synaptotagmin IV (53% overall identity; Fig. 1). Synaptotagmins IV and XI are homologous to each other in their N-terminal 73 amino acids which exhibit no sequence similarity to other synaptotagmins, defining them as a separate subgroup. In addition, the C2-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI are more closely related to each other than to those of other synaptotagmins. The sequence differences between different synaptotagmins are not random variations since they are evolutionarily conserved (98% identity between rat and mouse synaptotagmin IV) (11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C-terminal 104 amino acids of human synaptotagmin XI encoded by EST D38522 exhibits only a single amino acid change compared with the rat sequence. The C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I binds two Ca2+ ions through five aspartate residues located in two loops (19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Three of the aspartates are bifunctional and ligate both Ca2+ ions. Alignment of different C2A-domains shows that most contain either aspartates or glutamates at the five positions that are involved in Ca2+ binding (Fig.3). The C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI, however, are different. The general spacing is the same, but, in one position (corresponding to aspartate 230 in synaptotagmin I), a serine is substituted for the aspartate (Fig. 3). The aspartate to serine substitution appears not to be a sequencing or cloning artifact since it is present in both synaptotagmin IV and XI and since the serine is evolutionarily conserved in synaptotagmin IV (11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Aspartate 230 is a critical residue in synaptotagmin I since it coordinates both Ca2+ ions and is at the center of the C2-motif (19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Modeling of the analogous Ca2+-binding site in synaptotagmins IV and XI suggests that in the presence of serine instead of aspartate, Ca2+binding is unlikely (Fig. 4 A). This model also suggests that Ca2+ binding could potentially be restored if the serine is mutated to aspartate (Fig. 4 B). To test these hypotheses, we constructed expression vectors that direct the synthesis of GST-fusion proteins with the C2A-domains from synaptotagmins IV and XI either in the wild-type forms containing serine or in mutant forms containing aspartate instead of serine at the appropriate position. The GST-fusion proteins encoding the C2A-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI either as wild type proteins or with serine to aspartate substitutions were isolated, the linkers between GST and the fused C2A-domain were cut with thrombin, and the C2A-domains were purified to homogeneity (data not shown). As a test of Ca2+ binding, we used temperature denaturation experiments since binding of a ligand to a protein usually leads to stabilization of the protein structure. Temperature denaturation can be monitored by CD measurements at a conformation-dependent wavelength. This provides a sensitive method to analyze Ca2+ binding to C2-domains as shown previously for the wild type and mutant C2A-domains from synaptotagmin I (18Shao X. Li C. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Wild type C2A-domains from synaptotagmins IV and XI exhibited no change in denaturation temperature as a function of Ca2+ (Fig. 5, A andC), confirming that these C2-domains do not bind Ca2+ at concentrations of up to 5 mm although the data do not exclude the possibility of a binding site with even lower affinity. By contrast, C2A-domains carrying a single amino acid substitution that exchanged serine for aspartate at the position corresponding to aspartate 230 in synaptotagmin I experience Ca2+-dependent shifts in denaturation temperature (approximately 15 and 9 °C for synaptotagmins IV and XI, respectively; Fig. 5, B and D). Thus, the single amino acid substitution restores the ability to bind Ca2+to these C2-domains. The C2A-domains of most synaptotagmins but not of synaptotagmin IV bind phospholipids as a function of Ca2+, whereas Mg2+ is ineffective (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This agrees well with the aspartate to serine substitution in the C2-motif of the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV (Fig. 4). The questions now arise if synaptotagmin XI, with a similar substitution, is also unable to bind phospholipids as a function of Ca2+ and if mutating the wild type serine back to aspartate would confer Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to these two C2A-domains. Fusion proteins containing the wild type and mutant C2A-domains were immobilized on glutathione beads and used for phospholipid binding measurements. As shown in Fig.6, A-C, no Ca2+-dependent binding of phospholipids consisting of 29% PS and 71% PC was observed to the wild type C2A-domains from synaptotagmins IV and XI. In contrast, the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I exhibited robust Ca2+-specific phospholipid binding. No Ca2+-independent phospholipid binding was observed as the background level of phospholipids bound corresponds to that obtained with GST alone. The mutant C2A-domains, however, exhibited marked Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding that was not observed with Mg2+ (Fig. 6). These data suggest that the C2A-domains of the synaptotagmin IV/XI subclass contain a selective, evolutionarily conserved single amino acid substitution that inactivates Ca2+ binding and Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding. Recently, it was reported that the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV can bind 100% PS in a Ca2+-dependent manner although it does not bind to liposomes composed of mixtures of PS and PC (23Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Given the structure of the Ca2+-binding site in C2-domains (Fig. 4), this is a surprising finding since the C2A-domain is not expected to bind Ca2+ with the aspartate to serine substitution. However, PS itself binds Ca2+ at the concentrations used, and it is possible that clusters of negative charges by PS may also allow Ca2+binding to the protein with unanticipated properties. Furthermore, stable bilayers are difficult to obtain with 100% PS, which tends to aggregate. Since the assay used by Fukuda et al. (23Fukuda M. Kojima T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8430-8434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) utilized soluble GST-fusion proteins that were co-precipitated with lipids, the possibility arises that Ca2+-dependent PS aggregation could artifactually trap the C2A-domain. To test if 100% PS induces a novel Ca2+-binding site in wild type synaptotagmin IV, we investigated the Ca2+-dependent interactions of the wild type and mutant C2A-domains from synaptotagmin IV with 100% PS in an assay that does not depend on lipid co-precipitation to avoid artifacts. No binding of 100% PS to the wild type C2A-domain was observed (Fig. 6, D andE). Even with the mutant C2A-domain, which exhibits robust Ca2+-dependent binding to liposomes composed of 29% PS, 71% PC, Ca2+ only had an insignificant effect on binding of 100% PS. Since, in the C2A-domain of synaptotagmin I, only negatively charged phospholipids bind as a function of Ca2+, the absence of Ca2+-dependent binding of 100% PS to the mutant C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV is paradoxical. This result can best be explained by the assumption that a stable lipid bilayer may be required. To test this hypothesis, we made liposomes from 80% PS, 20% PC, which are more likely to contain stable bilayers. Now, Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to the mutant C2A-domain was observed although it was not as strong as that observed with our standard liposomes. The wild type C2A-domain, however, was still unable to bind. Together, these data provide further evidence for the conclusion that the wild type C2A-domain of synaptotagmin IV is not a Ca2+-binding domain and suggest that, even under conditions of PS enrichment, no Ca2+-dependent properties can be demonstrated. Synaptotagmins form a large family of genes with putative functions in membrane traffic (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). We now report the structure and properties of the 11th member of this family. Since it seems likely that additional synaptotagmins remain to be discovered, synaptotagmins now form one of the largest protein families in membrane traffic second only to rab proteins. The structure of synaptotagmin XI reveals that it defines a new subclass of synaptotagmins together with synaptotagmin IV. Synaptotagmins IV and XI are highly expressed in brain, and at lower levels in other tissues (Fig. 2; see Ref. 6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This indicates a function that is concentrated in brain but also operative in nonneural tissues. Synaptotagmins I and II probably serve as Ca2+ sensors in neurotransmitter release (10Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1281-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that the other synaptotagmins also represent membrane trafficking proteins at the plasma membrane, possibly in regulating different forms of exocytosis. In addition, synaptotagmins may function in endocytosis since all synaptotagmins tested are high affinity binding proteins for the clathrin adaptor protein complex, AP2 (6Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G.W. Brose N. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11Ullrich B. Li C. Zhang J.Z. McMahon H. Anderson R.G.W. Geppert M. Südhof T.C.

Cell. 1994; 78: 751-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The subgroup of synaptotagmins composed of synaptotagmins IV and XI is characterized by a homologous N-terminal region and by identical deviations from the C2-domain consensus sequence shared by most synaptotagmins (Figs. 1 and 3). The most remarkable change in the C2-domains of synaptotagmins IV and XI is the substitution of one of the aspartates of the Ca2+-binding site for a serine. This raises the question if a C2A-domain with this substitution is capable of Ca2+ binding. We show by two assays, the Ca2+-dependent shift in the heat denaturation curve and Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding, that Ca2+ has no effect on the C2A-domains from both synaptotagmins at concentrations up to 5 mm. A point mutation that reverses the evolutionary serine to aspartate substitution, however, restores both Ca2+-dependent properties to both synaptotagmins. This result indicates that this amino acid change is the only change in the C2A-domain that made the C2A-domains from synaptotagmins IV and XI Ca2+-independent. Thus, this subgroup of synaptotagmins is characterized by an evolutionarily conserved substitution in the C2A-domain that abolishes Ca2+ binding. The most amazing aspect of our findings is that evolution seems to have selected for the inactivation of Ca2+-binding in two different synaptotagmins by a single amino acid substitution while leaving the remaining structure intact. Based on their overall sequence similarity, it seems likely that synaptotagmins IV and XI share a common ancestor derived from the original “ur-synaptotagmin”. Further evolution then created the diversification into synaptotagmins IV and XI with many amino acid changes, including several in their C2A-domains. Nevertheless, these changes did not abolish the ability of these synaptotagmins to bind Ca2+ and to exhibit Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding if only the serine in the Ca2+-binding site was rechanged into aspartate. The structure of the C2-domain consists of a stable core composed of two β-sheets with three loops emerging on top and four on the bottom (16Sutton B. Davletov B.A. Berghuis A.M. Südhof T.C. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 929-938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding occurs only to the top and induces no electrostatic or conformational change in the bottom (18Shao X. Li C. Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,19Shao X. Davletov B. Sutton B. Südhof T.C. Rizo J.R. Science. 1996; 273: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It is possible that C2-domains serve as janus-faced interaction domains, a Ca2+-dependent top and a Ca2+-independent bottom (1Südhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 379-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). This would imply that in the synaptotagmin IV/XI subgroup, evolutionary pressure led to a selective retention of only the Ca2+-independent properties. Unfortunately no Ca2+-independent activities of a C2A-domain have been identified yet. Once these have been discovered, however, it will be important to test them in different synaptotagmins to determine if they are selectively retained in the Ca2+-independent forms. In a very interesting study, synaptotagmin IV was identified as an immediate early gene (26Vician L. Lim I.K. Ferguson G. Tocco G. Baudry M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2164-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This suggests that a switch from Ca2+-dependent to Ca2+-independent synaptotagmins may occur during strong stimulation of neurons. Such a switch could be particularly useful during pathological hyperexcitation that is accompanied by unimpeded Ca2+ influx. A switch to a Ca2+-unresponsive synaptotagmin under those conditions would eliminate a Ca2+ target and maybe inhibit excessive neurotransmitter release. Future studies will have to test this hypothesis and also investigate if synaptotagmin XI is also an immediate early gene. We thank A. Roth, E. Borowicz, and I. Leznicki, for excellent technical assistance, and Drs. M. S. Brown and J. L. Goldstein, for advice."

The regulation of apoptosis is a complex process and involves a number of gene products including the survival factor Bcl-2, which has been found to be frequently deregulated in human cancers. In addition to deregulation of apoptosis, the process of neoplasia is also believed to be driven by the activation of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein complex that adds telomeric repeats (hexanucleotide 5′-TTAGGG-3′) to the ends of replicating chromosomes. Activation of telomerase has been detected in a vast majority of human cancer cells. Although recent studies have demonstrated the wide occurrence of telomerase activation and Bcl-2 deregulation in human cancer cells, it remains unclear whether there is any linkage between the deregulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in cancer cells. In the studies presented here, we report that the stable overexpression of Bcl-2 in human cancer cells with low Bcl-2 expression was accompanied by increased levels of telomerase activity. In addition, using an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line, CTLL-2, we demonstrated that IL-2 deprivation (8 h), which is known to down-regulate Bcl-2 expression, also resulted in concurrent inhibition of telomerase activity in the absence of any detectable apoptosis and accumulation of cells in the G0/G1phase of the cell cycle. Re-exposure of IL-2-deprived CTLL-2 cells to the recombinant IL-2 led to the up-regulation of both Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity. Taken together, these findings establish a close linkage between the modulation of telomerase activity by survival factor Bcl-2, and provide a model to study regulation of telomerase activity by an anti-apoptotic pathway that is widely deregulated in cancer cells.

Szotstak J.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 11Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Telomeres play an important role in chromosome structural integrity and functions including protection against the activation of DNA-damage checkpoints, and to counter the loss of terminal DNA segments that occurs when linear DNA is replicated (12Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar). Recent reports have shown the involvement of telomerase function in acquisition of immortality in cancer cells as telomerase activity has been detected in the vast majority of human cancer cell lines and tumors tested, but is either absent or expressed at very low levels in most (but not all) somatic cells (13Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6514) Google Scholar, 14de Lange T.

The mechanism of telomerase activation during immortalization is not known at the moment. It has been proposed (16Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5 (, 1995): 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that telomerase activity is repressed in somatic cells; during cell division, telomeres continue to shorten until they reach a critical point at which some cellular factor(s) detect the shortened telomere, resulting in the exit from the cell cycle (M1 crisis) and the cell's senescence. Mutations in genes detecting genetic damage allow a clonal population to continue to divide and escape senescence, resulting in further telomeric loss. Further cell division leads to M2 crisis, and most cells die. However, a rare cell somehow activates its telomerase activity, resulting in stabilization of telomere length and immortalization, which may represent an essential requirement for the expansion of human cancer cells. Thus, activation of telomerase during immortalization may be also linked with the proliferation of cancer cells (16Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5 (, 1995): 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1996; 8: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Although both activation of telomerase activity and Bcl-2 deregulation have been widely detected in human tumor cells, it remains unclear whether there is any linkage between the deregulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in cancer cells. In the studies presented here, we investigated the influence of Bcl-2 expression on the levels of telomerase activity. We report that the overexpression of Bcl-2 in human cancer cells with low levels of Bcl-2 such as cervical carcinoma HeLa cells and colorectal carcinoma DiFi cells was accompanied by enhanced levels of telomerase activity compared with the levels of a telomerase activity present in control cells. In contrast, down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression in an IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T-cell line, CTLL-2, by IL-2 deprivation (8 h) resulted in concurrent inhibition of telomerase activity, and both of these phenotypes (down-regulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in IL-2-deprived CTLL-2 cells) could be effectively reversed by the addition of rIL-2. Taken together, these results demonstrate a close linkage between the deregulation of survival factor Bcl-2 and the telomerase activity in human cancer cells. The cell lines used were human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (8Mandal M. Maggirwar S.B. Sharma N. Kaufmann S.H Sun S.-C. Kumar R. J. Biol.

DiFi cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1), and CTLL-2 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5 ng/ml rIL-2 (Immunex). All complete culture medium contained 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells at a density of 106 cells/100-mm diameter plate were transfected with plasmid DNA containing the full-length human Bcl-2 cDNA and a selectable marker, a neomycin phosphotransferase gene (21Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graminger W. Bennetts S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), by calcium phosphate precipitation procedures as described (6Mandal M. Kumar R. Cell Growth Diff. 1996; 7: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kumar R. Mandal M. Lipton A. Harvey H. Thompson C.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 115-118Google Scholar, 8Mandal M. Maggirwar S.B. Sharma N.

Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Expression of Bcl-2 in individually isolated clones was determined by immunoblotting with Bcl-2 mAb. Once a stable cell line from each clone had been established, the drug was removed from the culture medium. The clonal lines have been maintained in drug-free medium since then, and expression of Bcl-2 was periodically examined. As a control, cells were transfected either with an unrelated PKR-plasmid DNA containing neomycin marker or with plasmid DNA containing neomycin phosphotransferase gene. All experiments were performed with cells in a logarithmic phase by controlling the plating density. Cell extracts were prepared as described (26Kumar R. Atlas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cell lysate containing equal amounts of total protein (15–25 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by probing with an anti-Bcl-2 mAb (Neomarkers Inc.) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibody (7Kumar R. Mandal M. Lipton A. Harvey H. Thompson C.B. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 115-118Google Scholar, 8Mandal M. Maggirwar S.B. Sharma N. Kaufmann S.H Sun S.-C. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30354-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As an internal control, the same blot was cut into two pieces, and the upper portion was probed with an unrelated heat shock protein (Hsp)-70 mAb (Neomarkers Inc.) or actin antibody (Sigma). Low molecular mass colored markers (Amersham Corp.) were used as molecular weight standards. Quantitation of specific protein bands was performed by using a protein data base scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Subconfluent cultures were used to prepare the detergent CHAPS extracts (13Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6514) Google Scholar). Telomerase enzyme activity was measured by using a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) kit from the Oncor Inc. as described (22Olson D.J. Gibo D.M. Saggers G. Debinski W. Kumar R. Cell Growth Diff. 1997; 8: 417-423PubMed Google Scholar, 23Engelhardt M. Kumar R. Albanell J. Pettengell R. Han W. Moore M.A.S. Blood. 1997; Google Scholar). Each reaction product was amplified in the presence of an internal TRAP assay standard (36 bp). The TRAP reaction products were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dried, and autoradiographed. The basal level of telomerase activity (ladder formation) was measured by serial dilution of the protein extracts, and an appropriate range of protein concentration was selected that produced a linear response. Each set of TRAP assay included control reaction tubes without any extract, and with extracts treated with RNase A (200 μg/ml). To quantitate the levels of telomerase activity, the average densitometric optical density of first six TRAP bands after a primer band was presented as a ratio to the internal TRAP assay standard band. Total RNA was prepared from subconfluent cells by TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 1 μg of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using a RNA PCR core kit (Perkin Elmer) as per manufacturer's instruction (24Bestilny L.J. Brown C.B. Miura Y. Robertson L.D. Riabowol K.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3796-3802PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification was carried out for 30 cycles. Equal aliquots of reaction product were analyzed by 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Primers for hTR were synthesized using the TRC3 sequence (24Bestilny L.J. Brown C.B. Miura Y. Robertson L.D. Riabowol K.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3796-3802PubMed Google Scholar, 25Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.-P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C. Yu J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2067) Google Scholar). As PCR reaction product size markers, we used glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers (reaction product about 300 bp), β2-microglobulin primers (reaction product about 550 bp), and hTR product (about 150 bp) from SW-480 positive control cells. Cell cycle distribution was determined by staining with propidium iodide (Sigma) as described (26Kumar R. Atlas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with propidium iodide and passed through the beam of an argon ion laser turned to 514 (FAC/Scan; Becton Dickinson). The resulting fluorescent signal was amplified, recorded in the memory, and analyzed in the form of a DNA histogram, by using a computer program interfaced with the integrator. To examine a possible relationship between Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity, we investigated whether deregulation of Bcl-2 in HeLa cells would modulate the levels of telomerase activity. For these studies, HeLa cells were transfected with a Bcl-2 expression vector (21Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graminger W. Bennetts S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) and G418-resistant clonal cell lines stably expressing Bcl-2 were generated (8Mandal M. Maggirwar S.B. Sharma N. Kaufmann S.H Sun S.-C. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30354-30359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows the levels of Bcl-2 protein in three out of seven such clones, HeLa/Bcl-2.2 (lane 2), HeLa/Bcl-2.1 (lane 3), and HeLa/Bcl-2.3 (lane 4). Clones 1 and 3 express 4–6-fold higher levels of Bcl-2, compared with the levels detected in the parental HeLa cells (lane 1) or in the clone expressing an unrelatedPKR/neo gene (lane 5). Results in panel B show the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on the levels of telomerase activity. It was noted that overexpression of Bcl-2 in HeLa cells leads to a significant enhancement (5–10-fold) in the levels of telomerase activity. The observed increase in telomerase activity resulted from overexpression of Bcl-2, since it was detected in both clone 1 and clone 3 (Fig. 1 B) but not in control HeLa cells or HeLa cells overexpressing an unrelated PKR/neo gene (HeLa/PKR.w1 cells). The observed increase in the levels of telomerase activity in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells was not due to elongation of telomere terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) as determined by the Southern hybridization of Hin fI-digested DNAs with telomeric probe (data not shown). Lack of association between telomerase activity and TRF length has been shown previously (27Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2140-4248Crossref Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 28Avilion A.A. Mieczyslaw A.P. Gupta J. Shay J.W. Bacchetti S. Greider C.W. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 645-650PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed relationship between Bcl-2 deregulation and enhanced telomerase activity is a phenomena restricted to HeLa cells or whether they can show it with other cells with low levels of Bcl-2, we examined the influence of Bcl-2 deregulation on the levels of telomerase activity in human colorectal carcinoma DiFi cells. Fig. 2 shows the levels of Bcl-2 expression in DiFi cells, its five Bcl-2-overexpressing clones, and three control neo transfectants. Overall, there was a 6–10-fold overexpression of Bcl-2 in different clone with highest being in clone 4 compared with parental DiFi cells or control vector transfectants. Results in Fig.2 B illustrate that all the Bcl-2-overexpressing clones have significantly elevated levels (8–12-fold) of telomerase activity compared with either control DiFi cells or neo clones. The observed differences in the levels of telomerase activity were not due to the presence of a potential telomerase inhibitor in extracts as we obtained similar results when assayed the levels of telomerase activity in Bcl-2-overexpressing DiFi clones as a function of protein concentration (Fig. 3). The observed increase in the levels of telomerase activity in DiFi/Bcl-2.5 cells compared with the levels in control cells was not due to enhanced expression of hTR component as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR assay (Fig. 2 C).Figure 3Telomerase activity in DiFi and its Bcl-2-overexpressing clones as a function of protein extracts.CHAPS extracts from DiFi cells and its clones were analyzed for telomerase activity by TRAP assay. For DiFi cells (lanes 1–3), TRAP assays were performed using 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μg of protein; for its Bcl-2 clones (lanes 4–15), TRAP assays were performed using 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.01 μg of protein.Lane 16, cell extract (0.1 μg) from Bcl-2-overexpressing clone 4 was inactivated by pretreatment with RNase A (200 μg/ml). Results shown are representative of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined the effect of bi-directional regulation of Bcl-2 expression on the status of telomerase activity in IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells (29Deng G. Podack E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As expected from the data in literature (29Deng G. Podack E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), IL-2 deprivation of CTLL-2 cells for as little as 8 h resulted in the down-regulation (40% inhibition compared with control cells) of Bcl-2 expression compared with the levels present in control cells (Fig. 4 B, compare lane 2 with lane 1), and this was associated with down-regulation of telomerase activity starting at 8 h post-IL-2 deprivation (Fig. 4 A). The observed early down-regulation in the levels of telomerase activity was not due to IL-2 deprivation-associated G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, as these phenotypic changes became evident only at 24 h and not 8 h post-IL-2 deprivation (Fig. 4 C). This view was further supported by the data in Fig.5 A, demonstrating that there was no significant effect of 8 h of IL-2 deprivation on the expression of apoptotic targets such as PARP and lamin B. Since IL-2 is a known inducer of Bcl-2 (29Deng G. Podack E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we examined whether exposure of IL-2-deprived CTLL-2 cells to rIL-2 will up-regulate telomerase activity. Results in Fig. 5 show that the down-regulation of both Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity could be reversed by the addition of rIL-2 to IL-2-deprived (24 h) CTLL-2 cells. Other experiments indicated that apoptosis triggered by IL-2 deprivation (24 h) was reversible by the addition of IL-2, as expected from the published data (29Deng G. Podack E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2189-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that IL-2 regulation of Bcl-2 expression may be closely related with modulation of telomerase activity in CTLL-2 model system.Figure 5Regulation of telomerase activity by IL-2 in CTLL-2 cells. A, CTLL-2 cells were cultured in IL-2-deprived medium for 8 h (lane 2) or 24 h (lane 3). At 24 h post-IL-2 deprivation, CTLL-2 culture was supplemented by recombinant IL-2 (0.5 ng/ml) for 24 h (lane 4) or 48 h (lane 5).

Apoptosis is regulated by specific cellular pathways including Bcl-2, deregulation of apoptosis contributes to the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases including cancer, and Bcl-2 deregulation is frequently associated with human cancer. Emerging lines of evidence suggest that in addition to deregulation of apoptosis, the process of neoplasia may be also driven by the activation of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme complex that adds telomeric repeats to the ends of replicating chromosomes. Although activation of telomerase activity has been detected in human cancer cells, it remains unclear whether there is any linkage between the deregulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity. The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible relationship between the modulation of Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity. We have now demonstrated that the deregulation of Bcl-2 expression in human cancer cells with low levels of Bcl-2 is closely linked with the increased levels of telomerase activity as overexpression of Bcl-2 in HeLa and DiFi cells was accompanied by increased telomerase activity compared with control transfectants and/or parental cells. Since the activation of telomerase activity has been shown to be associated with the development of human cancer (16Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5 (, 1995): 293-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1996; 8: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), our finding of potential involvement of survival factor Bcl-2 in the deregulation of telomerase activity may provide an important insight into the molecular mechanism involved in the initiation of cellular malignancies. The finding that Bcl-2 enhances telomerase activity without elongation of telomeric TRFs in HeLa cells is interesting, as it raises the possibility that additional pathway(s) such as Bcl-2 deregulation that may influence telomerase activity in cancer cells. The observation that HeLa clones with variable levels of Bcl-2 expression (Fig. 1 A) exhibited comparable enhanced levels of telomerase activity would suggest that the deregulation of Bcl-2 over the presumptive threshold levels may not further up-regulate telomerase activity, and this threshold level could differ from one cell type to another. Our finding that IL-2 deprivation of CTLL-2 cells for 8 h was sufficient to down-regulate both Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity (Fig. 4) without any detectable apoptosis (Fig. 4 C) is important, as it suggests a close relationship between the levels of survival factor Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in cancer cells. Since IL-2 signal was sufficient to concurrently influence the levels of both Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in CTLL-2 cells, it remains to be resolved whether the observed modulation of telomerase activity by IL-2 is mediated via changes in Bcl-2 expression and/or a direct effect of IL-2 and/or both Bcl-2 expression and telomerase activity are regulated via a IL-2-responsive common pathway(s). Taken together, these findings provide new evidence in support of possible association between the deregulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity, and are consistent with the predicted role of telomerase in maintaining the integrity of chromosomes against DNA damage. It remains to be seen whether the observed increase in the levels of telomerase activity is a phenomenon restricted to Bcl-2 or a general event associated with other anti-apoptotic gene products such as Bcl-XL. Recent studies have indicated that the cells from a variety of human cancer may have a decreased ability to undergo apoptosis in response to physiologic stimuli, and a defect in apoptosis has been proposed to be involved in the aberrant survival and/or development of cancer (4Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6179) Google Scholar). Therefore, in recent years, approaches such as identification of agent(s) that can modulate Bcl-2 have become the subject of active investigation to control cancer cell growth. In addition to apoptosis, telomerase has also attracted a great deal of interest as a possible target in cancer biology. The apparent lower levels of measurable telomerase activity in many normal cells and its widespread detection in human cancer cells have raised the possibility that telomerase may also serve an important target to control cell growth. In spite of wide occurrence of deregulation of Bcl-2 and telomerase activity in cancer cells, to date, to the best of our knowledge, no close linkage between these two phenotypes has been reported. Our findings of the modulation of telomerase activity by a widely deregulated survival factor, Bcl-2, may serve an important model to study the regulation of telomerase activity by an apoptotic pathway and could open new possibilities to develop novel strategies to control cancer cell growth by co-targeting both pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2071578025,"A novel broad host range antimicrobial substance, Thermophilin 13, has been isolated and purified from the growth medium of Streptococcus thermophilus. Thermophilin 13 is composed of the antibacterial peptide ThmA (Mr of 5776) and the enhancing factor ThmB (Mr of 3910); the latter peptide increased the activity of ThmA ∼40 ×. Both peptides are encoded by a single operon, and an equimolar ratio was optimal for Thermophilin 13 activity.

Mass spectrometry did reveal the apparent oxidation of methionines in ThmA, which resulted in a peptide that could not be enhanced any longer by ThmB, whereas the intrinsic bactericidal activity was normal. Thermophilin 13 dissipated the membrane potential and the pH gradient in liposomes, and this activity was independent of membrane components from a sensitive strain (e.g. lipid or proteinaceous receptor).

Antibacterial membrane-acting peptides form a heterogeneous family of structures that can be subdivided in different classes on the basis of primary sequence, mode of synthesis (ribosomal versus non-ribosomal), post-translational modifications, and structure (linear, cyclic, α-helical, and β-sheet). The following classes can be discriminated: (i) antibiotics (non-ribosomal synthesis,e.g. gramicidins (1Zuber P. Nakano M.M. Marahiel M.A. Sonenshein A.L. Hoch J.A. Losick R. Bacillus Subtilis and Other Gram-positive Bacteria: Biochemistry, Physiology, and Molecular Genetics.American Society for Microbiology Washington, D. C. 1992; : 897-916Google Scholar)); (ii) lantibiotics (lanthionine-containing peptides, e.g. Nisin (2Sahl H. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 827-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)); (iii) host defense peptides (3Maloy W.L. Kari U.P. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 105-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) of mammals (e.g. defensins), frogs (e.g. magainins), and insects (e.g. cecropins). Some peptides have a strong hemolytic activity in addition to antibacterial properties, like (iv) bee venoms (e.g. melittin (4Dempsey C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1031: 143-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar)) and (v) bacterial cytolysins (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus δ-toxin (5Mellor I.R. Thomas D.H. Samson M.S.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 942: 280-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). A particular class of antibacterial peptides is formed by (vi) the bacteriocins (e.g. lactococcins, Pediocins), which are produced by lactic acid bacteria and preferentially inhibit species that are closely related to the producer (6Jack R.W. Tagg J.R. Ray B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 171-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides their differences in structure and mode of membrane interaction, antibacterial membrane-acting peptides may differ in their requirement for specific lipids or proteins and/or membrane potential or pH gradient to insert properly into target membranes and/or to exhibit maximal activity. These requirements determine to a large extent the inhibitory spectrum of a particular peptide. Moreover, in case of the lantibiotics and bacteriocins, an immunity protein is synthesized that protects the producer organism (7Abee T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 129: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Bacteriocins are often considered to be different from other antibacterial membrane-acting peptides by the fact that they require a proteinaceous membrane component (i.e. receptor) for antibacterial activity, which is consistent with their narrow host range specificity (6Jack R.W. Tagg J.R. Ray B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 171-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A property of some of the peptide bacteriocins is their ability to form poration complexes that are composed of two different peptides (8Nissen-Meyer J. Holo H. Havarstein L.S. Sletten K. Nes I.F. J.

These bacteriocins have a very narrow inhibitory spectrum of activity (6Jack R.W. Tagg J.R. Ray B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 171-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the so-called Listeria-active bacteriocins share a consensus sequence motif (YGNGV-C) at their amino terminus (9Klaenhammer T.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 39-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) which could be of importance for their ability to inhibitListeria species. The “Listeria-active bacteriocins” have not been reported to form poration complexes. In this article, we describe the properties of a broad host range pore-forming antimicrobial activity, named Thermophilin 13. The compound has structural and functional features of bacteriocins, in particular those that form poration complexes. However, none of the two peptides of Thermophilin 13 owes the antilisterial YGNGV-C consensus sequence and a proteinaceous receptor is not required for activity. We also present a model of the poration complex formed by Thermophilin 13 on the basis of structural similarities with host defense peptides and other pore-forming structures. The bacteriocin producerStreptococcus thermophilus SFi13 as well as the indicator micro-organisms are from the Nestlé strain collection. The indicator strain used to assess the bacteriocin concentration (activity) during purification was S. thermophilus SFi3.Lactococcus, Streptococcus, andEnterococcus strains were grown semi-anaerobically in M17 broth (Oxoid, U K) supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) glucose at 30, 42, and 30 °C, respectively. Lactobacillus,Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, andBifidobacteria strains were grown in MRS, 0.5% (w/v) glucose (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur, France) at 30 °C except for the thermophilic Lactobacilli (42 °C) andBifidobacterium (37 °C). Clostridium strains (spores and vegetative cells) were grown in RCM (Oxoid) at 30 °C under an atmosphere of 85% (v/v) N2, 5% CO2, 10% H2. Bacillus (30 °C),Listeria (30 °C), Micrococcus (30 °C),Staphylococcus (30 °C), Salmonella (37 °C), and Escherichia coli strains (37 °C) were all grown in BHI (Difco) at the temperatures indicated. E. coli BZ234 (C600 derivative allowing α-complementation; Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland) was grown in Luria broth (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). S. thermophilus SFi13 was grown semi-anaerobically at 42 °C in 1 liter of M17 supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose (M17S, M17 broth (Oxoid) supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose) until 2 h into the stationary phase. Cells were removed by centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 20 min), and the pH was adjusted to 1.6 by phosphoric acid. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C), and the soluble fraction, containing the antibacterial activity, was concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (trichloroacetic acid, 10% (w/v) final). The pellet was washed twice with cold acetone (−20 °C), resuspended in 8 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and heated for 20 min in boiling water. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation; the soluble sample obtained was termed trichloroacetic acid extract. The bacteriocin activity was measured in an agar well assay. Briefly, 5 ml of M17S Top-Agar (0.75% (w/v)) were mixed with 20 μl of an overnight culture of the indicator strain SFi3 and poured on top of 35 ml of M17S-Agar (1.5% (w/v)). Wells of 70 μl were made using a 3.5-mm diameter punch-holer connected to a vacuum device, and serial dilutions of the sample were assayed in different wells. Consequently, the highest dilution still showing activity defines the activity of the 70-μl aliquot in terms of arbitrary units (AU). 1The abbreviations used are: AU, arbitrary units; MS, mass spectrometry; RPC, reverse phase chromatography; 15-Phe, Source 15-Phe reverse phase column HR16/10; Resource-RPC, resource reverse phase column; COVs, cytochrome c oxidase-containing liposomes; TPP+, tetraphenylphosphonium ion; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); ORF, open reading frames. The amount of Thermophilin 13 in a given volume (V μl) was expressed in total units (U = (AU/70) × V). The concentration of Thermophilin 13 was defined as AU/ml = AU/70 × 1000. The trichloroacetic acid pellet of a 1-liter culture was dissolved in 8 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6m urea plus 2 m NaCl and used for purification on a 20-ml Source 15-Phe resin (15-Phe) packed into a HR16/10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Flow rates were kept constant at 4 ml/min. The column was first washed with 100 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 m NaCl (buffer A) before applying a 60-ml linear gradient of buffer A to buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), which was followed by 150 ml of buffer B and 100 ml of H2O. Thermophilin 13 was eluted with 60 ml of buffer C (70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 30% (v/v) water, and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid). 20 ml of 100% methanol were added to the active fractions (∼40 ml total), and the volume was reduced to 24 ml by rotary evaporation (approximately 50% (v/v) methanol, final concentration). This sample was applied to a 3-ml Resource RP column (RPC, Pharmacia, NL), previously equilibrated with 50% (v/v) methanol, 50% water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer E). A flow rate of 2 ml/min was kept throughout the procedure. After washing with 100 ml of buffer E at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, a linear gradient from buffer E to 100% acetonitrile (in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied in 30 min. Two main peaks were characterized by electrospray-MS and re-chromatographed separately after dilution (1:1) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Both peaks were collected from two independent runs, re-analyzed by electrospray-MS, and stored at −20 °C in their elution solvent. Electrospray mass spectra were recorded on a R 3010 quadrupole mass spectrometer (NERMAG, Argenteuil, France) equipped with a custom-built pneumatically assisted electrospray (ion spray) ion source. The molecular weight of the peptides is determined by measurement of multiply charged ions (11Covey T.R. Bonner R.F. Shushan B.I. Rapid. Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). All molecular masses quoted in this paper are average, chemical atomic masses. Multiwell dishes (Falcon 3046) were filled with 6 ml of Agar medium per dish and 0.7 ml of Top-Agar were inoculated with 0.1–1% of an overnight culture or 105spores/ml of Top-Agar. Each strain was tested with 300 AU of Thermophilin 13 which was obtained after dilution of the trichloroacetic acid extract with 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. A control of bacteriocin activity was included for each strain using a proteinase K-treated sample (5 μg/ml at 37 °C for 20 min). Minimum inhibitory concentration values were estimated from the size of the halos obtained with the trichloroacetic acid extract; the data were calibrated on the basis of the inhibition ofS. thermophilus SFi3 strain (1 AU = 11 nm). This method was validated for Clostridium botulinum,Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis,Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and S. thermophilus, using purified Thermophilin 13 (equimolar ratio of ThmA and ThmB). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard, unless indicated otherwise. General procedures for DNA isolation fromE. coli, restriction analysis, ligation, electrophoresis, Southern analysis, and colony hybridization were carried out as described previously (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). For preparation of genomic DNA from S. thermophilus, cells were grown in 2 ml of M17S until the mid-log phase, treated with lysosyme (13Marciset O. Mollet B. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1993; 43: 490-496Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and resuspended in 2 ml of STE (25% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA). SDS and RNase A were added to final concentrations of 1% (w/v) and 50 μg/ml, respectively, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 55 °C. DNA fibers were spooled in 70% ethanol, solubilized overnight in TE, and extracted with chloroform (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). A set of degenerate oligonucleotides was deduced from the 48 amino acid amino-terminal sequence of ThmA. The forward primer corresponded to 5′GAYATGGGNGGNTAYGC3′ (For1) and the reverse primers corresponded to 3′GTACANCCNCGNTAACG5′ (Rev1), 3′GTACANCCNCGNTAGCG5′(Rev2), 3′GTACANCCNCGNTATCG5′(Rev3), 3′GTGCANCCNCGNTAACG5′(Rev4), 3′GTGCANCCNCGNTAGCG5′(Rev5), and 3′GTGCANCCNCGNTATCG5′(Rev6). Primers and chromosomal DNA were used at final concentrations of 5 μm and 1.3 μg/ml, respectively. Other components were added as specified in the polymerase chain reaction protocol using SuperTaq polymerase of Boehringer Mannheim, and a 5-min denaturation cycle at 95 °C was followed by 30 cycles of 30 s 95 °C, 30 s 42 °C, and 30 s 72 °C; elongation was achieved by a final 5-min step at 72 °C. Polymerase chain reaction fragments of the expected size (128 bp) were eluted, ligated into plasmid pGEM-T (Promega, CH), and propagated in E. coli BZ234. The 128-bp fragment was used as a hybridization probe (primer extension, Boehringer Mannheim) to identify and clone a 3.8-kb Eco RI-Hin dIII genomic DNA fragment that carried the genes for ThmA and ThmB. Recombinant strains of E. coli BZ234 were identified by colony hybridization using the 128-bp probe on Zeta-probe membranes (Bio-Rad) (10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments, data base searching, and structure prediction methods were used from the GCG package (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.), PCGENE and the EMBL worldwide web servers ([email protected]). Hairpin turns were accepted when the conformational potential for each residue of the tetrapeptide to be in turn <pt> is higher than <pα> and <pβ> (14Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar), and the probability of forming a β-turn by a tetrapeptide was p(t)10−4 > 2 (15Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar). Right-side out membrane vesicles ofS. thermophilus and their fusion to cytochrome c oxidase containing liposomes (COVs) were performed in 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.0, as described previously (16Foucaud C. Poolman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22087-22094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane potential (ΔΨ) was estimated from the distribution of tetraphenylphosphonium ion (TPP+) using an ion-selective electrode (17Konings W.N. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 16: 419-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). COVs or hybrid membranes were diluted into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.3, plus 5 mm MgSO4, (saturated with oxygen) to a final concentration of 153 nm in cytochrome c oxidase. A proton motive force was generated in COVs or hybrid membranes by adding the electron donor system ascorbate (10 mm), TMPD (200 μm) plus cytochrome c (10 μm), and oxygen (18Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ΔΨ was calculated after correction for probe binding to the membrane (19Lolkema J.S. Hellingwerf K.J. Konings W.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 85-94Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and using a specific internal volume of 1.5 μl/mg lipids (20Viitanen P. Newman J. Foster D.L. Wilson T.H. Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 429-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The pH gradient was monitored by the fluorescent pH indicator pyranine (21Damiano E. Bassilana M. Rigaud J. Leblanc G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 166: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Pyranine was entrapped in the COVs by freeze/thaw/sonication as described previously (18Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 394-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and external pyranine was removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G25. Pyranine-containing COVs were diluted into 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.3, plus 5 mm MgSO4(saturated with oxygen), to a final concentration of 46 nmin cytochrome c oxidase, and ΔpH was estimated from the changes in pyranine fluorescence. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured in liposomes by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 550–540 nm (α-peak) (22Gao F.H. Abee T. Konings W.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1991; 57: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of Thermophilin 13. The reaction was performed in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.3, plus 5 mmMgSO4 (saturated with oxygen), at a final concentration of 16 nm in cytochrome c oxidase and in the presence of 60 nm valinomycin plus 60 nmnigericin. S. thermophilus SFi13 produced 570 AU/ml of Thermophilin 13 when grown in M17S and harvested after 2 h in the stationary phase. Clarification of the medium supernatant by phosphoric acid resulted in the removal of exo-polysaccharides as well as 99% (w/w) of proteins (TableI); the increase in activity after trichloroacetic acid precipitation could be assigned to the decrease in pH as the activity of Thermophilin 13 increases 4-fold when the pH is lowered from 8.0 to 2.0 (data not shown). Also, variations in activity throughout the purification can be ascribed to a loss of Thermophilin 13, variations in pH, or changes in aggregation states (i.e. solubilization) of the bacteriocin. Thermophilin 13 was purified further on a Source 15-Phe resin, which eliminated 93% of the remaining contaminants (Table I). An activity of 113 AU/ml was obtained after the Resource-RPC for the fractions eluting between 17.5 and 19 min; a much higher activity was obtained when these fractions were mixed with those eluting between 21 and 24 min. Both sets of fractions were re-chromatographed independently on the Resource-RPC and analyzed by electrospray MS (Fig. 1). A Mrof 5776 was determined for the fractions eluting between 17.5 and 19 min, and two molecular weights were found for the fractions eluting between 21 and 24 min (Fig. 1). These latter two compounds were named ThmB (Mr of 3910) and ThmB′ (Mr of 3892). As shown in Table I, the Resource-RPC eliminated 94% of the remaining contaminating proteins but resulted in a decrease in total activity from 220 to 27 kU. The apparent loss in activity is partly due to the fact that only peak fractions, which were pure by electrospray-MS criteria, were used in the calculation of the activity. It should also be stressed that the concentration of the purified peptides was estimated from their absorbance at 280 nm, using extinction coefficients of 1490 and 5500m−1 cm−1 for Tyr and Trp, respectively (23Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar), rather than the Lowry assay (12Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which was used throughout the purification procedure.Table IPurification of Thermophilin 13StepsVolumepHTotal activityProtein amount1-aAccording to Lowry et al.

Open table in a new tab As already suggested by the experiments presented above, fractions containing ThmB seem to enhance the activity of ThmA. The enhancing properties of ThmB are clearly shown in Fig. 2(left panel), i.e. the diameter of inhibition of growth by ThmA is increased in the presence of ThmB (top left panel). The activity of 2.2 μm ThmA was 20 AU (top left panel), whereas the activity of 1.1 μm ThmA plus 1.1 μm ThmB was 400 AU. In other words, the activity of ThmA is enhanced 40-fold in the presence of an equimolar concentration of ThmB. The antibacterial activity at different concentrations and ratios is presented in Fig.3. Surfaces of the inhibition zones were plotted as a function of ThmA and ThmB concentration in the range of 0 to 2.2 μm (0–155 pmol/well). The largest inhibition zones were observed at the diagonal connecting equimolar concentration of ThmA and ThmB (Fig. 3 A), and the minimum inhibitory concentration value of Thermophilin 13 was estimated to be 11 nm forS. thermophilus SFi3 as indicator strain (Fig.3 C). In Fig. 3 B, the antibacterial activity of Thermophilin 13 is shown at high amounts of ThmA relative to ThmB. It appeared that 1100 nm ThmA has the same activity as 27 nm of ThmA plus 27 nm ThmB (Fig.3 B). Fig. 3 C shows that ThmB has no intrinsic activity even at high concentrations (2200 nm), and Fig.3 D shows that a large excess of ThmB over ThmA inhibits the activity of the latter peptide.Figure 3Antibacterial properties of ThmA and ThmB.

Prior to growth, wells were made in which diluted, neutralized trichloroacetic acid extract or purified ThmA and/or ThmB were introduced; proteinase K-treated samples were used as negative controls. The results obtained with the neutralized extract were similar to those of ThmA plus ThmB, indicating that a single bacteriocin is produced by S. thermophilus SFi13 under the conditions tested. Diameters of inhibition surrounding the wells were measured after overnight growth. As for other peptide bacteriocins, a narrow inhibitory spectrum was expected for Thermophilin 13 (6Jack R.W. Tagg J.R. Ray B. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 171-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Klaenhammer T.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 39-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thermophilin 13, however, exerted a broad host range activity among Gram-positive bacteria (Table II). Not only lactic acid bacteria were affected, but also L. monocytogenes and spore-forming micro-organisms like C. botulinum and B. cereus. Interestingly, growth from spores as well as from vegetative cells was inhibited. Bacterial genera most related to the producer (e.g. streptococci, enterococci,lactococci, lactobacilli) were inhibited to the same extent as more distantly related organisms (e.g. bacilli, clostridiae). All Gram-negative bacteria tested (E. coli, Pseudomonas andSalmonella species) were resistant. ThmA alone had an intrinsic activity that was enhanced by ThmB on all strains tested.Table IIInhibitory spectrum of Thermophilin 13SpeciesStrains2-aAll strains are from the Nestlé strain collection.Diameter of inhibition2-bDiameter of inhibition observed with 300 AU of Thermophilin 13.MIC2-cMinimum inhibitory concentration, to observe a halo in the Agar well assay.mmnmS. thermophilusSFi313.511Enterococcus faeciumSFM110413Lactococcus cremorisSC1110413Lactobacillus acidophilusLQ19.5470Lactobacillus helveticusLH313.511Lactobacillus fermentumL2610.5206Leuconostoc cremorisLCC111150Leuconostoc mesenteroidesLCM1810413Bifidobacterium bifidumBB915.55PropionibacteriumPP11317Listeria innocua246.51885L. monocytogenes5910.5206B. subtilisA27.51650B. cereusC141269C. borulinum1000031317Clostridium tyrobutyricum1070019660Staphylococcus carnosusSTC781100Micrococcus variansMCV1811002-a All strains are from the Nestlé strain collection.2-b Diameter of inhibition observed with 300 AU of Thermophilin 13.2-c Minimum inhibitory concentration, to observe a halo in the Agar well assay. Open table in a new tab Amino-terminal sequences of ThmA and ThmB were determined (initial yield of 1150 and 1160 pmol, respectively). Oligonucleotide primers were designed on the basis of the amino-terminal sequence of ThmA (48 residues): YSGKDX LKDMGGYALAGAGSGALX GAPAGX VGALPGAFVGAHVGAIAG. The sequences DMGGYA and HVGAIA were used to design the forward (For1) and six different reverse primers (Rev1–6), respectively. The expected 128-bp fragment was obtained in a polymerase chain reaction with the primers For1 and Rev1 using SFi13 genomic DNA as template. The 128-bp probe hybridized to a 4.2-kb Hin dIII and a 3.8Hin dIII-Eco RI fragment in the producer strain SFi13; these fragments were not detected by hybridization in the non-producer sensitive SFi3 strain. Subsequently, SFi13 chromosomalHin dIII-Eco RI DNA fragments of 3.6–4 kb were ligated into pUC19, and the recombinant plasmids were transformed toE. coli BZ234. Colony hybridization identified 16 putative positive colonies, among a total of 250, containing a 3.7-kbHin dIII-Eco RI insert that was sequenced and searched for open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 4). Two ORFs corresponding to ThmA and ThmB were found. Both peptides are synthesized with a signal sequence typical of lactic acid bacteria peptide bacteriocins, i.e. the processing site is preceded by a double glycine motif. The calculated molecular masses of ThmA and ThmB are 5776.7 and 3910.5 Da, respectively. The translation of ThmB is most likely coupled to that of a 52-amino acid hydrophobic peptide, termed ORFC; no homologue of ORFC was found in the data bases. Putative promoter elements, ribosome binding sites, and a rho-independent terminator structure were found in the regions flanking the ORFs (Fig.4). Genetic analysis of ThmA and ThmB showed the presence of two cysteines in each peptide. Since Thermophilin 13 was fully active in the presence of 50 mm dithiothreitol, using the agar well assay, disulfide bonds are most likely not required for activity. The calculated average molecular masses of ThmA (5776.7 Da) and ThmB (3910.5) are consistent with the masses obtained after purification on Resource-RPC,i.e. 5776 ± 1 and 3910 ± 1 Da, respectively (Table III). However, a peak shoulder was noticed upon re-chromatography of ThmB on Resource-RPC (Fig. 1). MS analysis revealed a mass of 3892 Da in the shoulder (Table III), which is ∼18 Da lower than that calculated from the translated nucleotide sequence of ThmB. This reduction in mass also occurred in the synthesized peptide ThmB upon prolonged storage but did not affect the enhancing properties of ThmB (purified or synthesized). Electrospray-MS also revealed chemical modifications in ThmA; the modified product was termed ThmA′. Comparison of the MS spectra of ThmA and ThmA′ shows two additional peaks for each multiply protonated species, leading to triplets for the ions with 3, 4, and 5 charges (Mr + 3H+, Mr+ 4H+, or Mr + 5H+) (Table III). These data indicate that ThmA′ has gained one or two times 16 Da (average of 3 × 5, 4 × 4, and 5 × 3 Da), which corresponds to the gain of one or two oxygen atoms and suggests that ThmA becomes oxidized upon storage. Although ThmA′ was as active as ThmA (Fig. 2, right panel, top part), the activity of ThmA′ was no longer e"

This new protease is closely related, in terms of amino acid sequence and structural organization, to the previously identified pathogenesis-related subtilisin-like protease (Tornero, P., Conejero, V., and Vera, P. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 6332–6337). The 745-residue amino acid sequence of P69B begins with a cleavable signal peptide, contains a prodomain and a 631-residue mature domain which is homologous to the catalytic modules of bacterial subtilisins and eukaryotic Kex2-like proteases. Within the catalytic domain, the essential Asp, His, and Ser residues that conform the catalytic triad of this family of proteases are conserved in P69B. Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated widespread induced expression of the 2.5-kilobase hybridizing mRNA in plant tissues as a consequence of viroid infection. We propose that P69B is a member of a complex gene family of plant Kex2/subtilisin-like proteases presumably involved in a number of specific proteolytic events activated during pathogenesis in plants and that takes place in the extracellular matrix.

Infection of plants with pathogens results in the induction of numerous host-specific biochemical responses, some of which are critical for the ability of the plant to withstand diseases (1Dixon R.A.

Physiological and pathological studies have examined diseased plants in the hope of uncovering the cause(s) of the pathogen-induced distress, and there is a plethora of studies describing the dramatic effect of pathogen infection upon different aspects of plant metabolism and catabolic disturbances (2Fraser R.S.S. Biochemistry of Virus-infected Plants. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, United Kingdom1989Google Scholar, 3Zaitlin M. Hull R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1987; 38: 291-315Crossref Google Scholar, 4Goodman R.N Novacky A.J. The Hypersensitive Reaction in Plants to Pathogens. APS Press, St. Paul, MN1994Google Scholar). What is lacking, however, is a clear understanding of how different pathogens promote the often deleterious symptoms observed by switching on a common cascade of cellular events resulting in the disease syndrome and the accompanying resistant character to subsequent pathogenic attacks. Viroids are the smallest known plant infectious agents, made up of nude, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules of a few hundred nucleotides which do not code for any protein (5Diener T.O. The Viroids. Plenum, New York1987Google Scholar, 6Semancik J.S. Viroids and Viroid-like Pathogens. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987Google Scholar), and thus they are an adequate model to analyze the physiological and molecular basis of plant responses to pathogen infection. This is more relevant if we consider that the viroid elicited responses resemble those resulting from infection by more complex type of pathogens or different kind of stresses (7Semancik J.S. Conejero V. Semancik J.S. Viroid and Viroid-like Pathogens. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1987: 72-120Google Scholar, 8Conejero V. Bellés J.M. Garcı́a-Breijo F. Garro R. Hernández-Yago J. Rodrigo I. Vera P. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 1990; 14: 233-261Google Scholar). It has been shown previously (8Conejero V. Bellés J.M. Garcı́a-Breijo F. Garro R. Hernández-Yago J. Rodrigo I. Vera P. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 1990; 14: 233-261Google Scholar) that plants infected with viroids produce de novo synthesis of a set of host-encoded proteins termed pathogenesis-related (PR) 1The abbreviations used arePRpathogenesis-related;RTreverse transcription;PCRpolymerase chain reaction;PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. proteins. The function of some PR proteins as hydrolytic enzymes (e.g. chitinases or β-1,3-glucanases) has been demonstrated in many plant species irrespective of the nature of the attacking pathogen, and they appear to play a role in the induced defense response of the plant to combat pathogens (9Bol J, F. Linthorst H.J.M. Cornelissen B.J.C. Annu. Rev. Phytopath. 1990; 28: 113-138Crossref Google Scholar, 10Bowles D.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 873-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). pathogenesis-related; reverse transcription; polymerase chain reaction; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein degradation as well as protein processing and maturation are believed to be important events in the plant defense response (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 12Schaller A. Ryan C.A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 13Pautot V. Holzer F.M. Reisch B. Walling L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9906-9910Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this regard, one of the viroid-induced PR proteins has been identified as a protease that was termed PR-P69 (14Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vera P. Conejero V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 323-334Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recent molecular cloning (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) indicated that P69 is a protein structurally related to the yeast processing protease Kex2, the prototypic member of the eukaryotic subtilisin-like protease family. This new finding broadens our understanding of defense responses activated by microbes, and opens a new perspective to unravel how plants perceive pathogenic insults and activate signaling processes that results in a resistant character to subsequent pathogenic challenges. In this paper we have have explored the existence of additional proteolytic activities activated in tomato plants following viroid infection. We performed comparative chromatographic fractionation of cell homogenates and determined differences in proteolytic profiles between healthy and infected plants. Using specific antibodies raised against the previously identified P69 protease, we identified a distinct, but immunologically related P69-like proteinase, that accumulates also in infected tissues. These studies were followed by the cloning of an inducible gene encoding a new subtilisin-like proteinase member related to the previously identified P69 protease (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also discuss possible functions for this inducible protease family during pathogenesis in plants. Conditions for growth of tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum), and method for inoculation with citrus exocortis viroid have been described (8Conejero V. Bellés J.M. Garcı́a-Breijo F. Garro R. Hernández-Yago J. Rodrigo I. Vera P. NATO ASI Ser. Ser. H Cell Biol. 1990; 14: 233-261Google Scholar). Tissues were harvested 4 weeks after inoculation and stored at −80 °C. Restriction enzymes and modification enzymes were obtained from Boehringer. DEAE Sepharose CL-6B, T7-sequencing, and Ready-to-go DNA labeling kits were obtained from Pharmacia. Radioactive compounds were from Amersham Corp. All other commonly available reagents were of analytical grade. All operations were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. Leaf tissue (10 g) showing symptoms of viroid infection was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and homogenized in a mortar and pestle with 30 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.21, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. Supernatants were immediately used or stored at −70 °C. The supernatant was adjusted to 20% saturation with solid (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then adjusted to 70% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 and centrifuged as described above. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 2.5 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol) and desalted in Sephadex G-25 (PD10 columns, Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A. The eluted proteins were then applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. After washing with equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with 250 ml of a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions were assayed for proteolytic activity using fluorescein isothiocyanate-casein as substrates as described previously (14Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the protein content analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out in 14% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (14Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Mr markers used were bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), and lactalbumin (14 kDa). Blotting of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes from SDS-PAGE gels was performed as described previously (15Vera P. Conejero V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 323-334Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The blots were then processed for immunological staining as described previously using anti-P69 antiserum (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the antigen-antibody sandwich revealed with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and 4-chloro-1-naphthol/H2O2staining. A λ-ZAP cDNA library was constructed from poly(A) mRNA isolated from viroid-infected tomato leaves (16Vera P. Tornero P. Conejero V. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 790-794PubMed Google Scholar). The library was screened at 52 °C as described by Church and Gilbert (17Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar) with a radiolabeled p26 cDNA encoding the P69A protein (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and plaques were isolated by standard techniques (16Vera P. Tornero P. Conejero V. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 790-794PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA inserts were excised from phage DNA, cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), and sequenced by using a T7 polymerase kit (Pharmacia). DNA sequence analysis was performed on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method (18Hattoni M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 152: 232-238Crossref Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Nested deletions of the cDNA cloned in pBluescript SK+ were generated using an exonuclease III-S1 nuclease kit (Promega). Sequence searches and analyses were done using FASTA, MAP, and BESTFIT routines of the University of Wisconsin Genetic Computer Group package (19Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 12: 387-395Crossref Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). RNA was purified from different tomato plant tissues as described (20Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1610) Google Scholar). For RNA gel blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted onto Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loading of RNA was verified by ethidium bromide staining of the gel before transfer to the membrane. Alternatively, the RNA blots were hybridized with a radiolabeled cDNA probe for the constitutively expressed pentaubiquitin (5xUBI) gene to verify equal loading. DNA was isolated from leaves as described (21Rogers S.O. Bendich A.J. Gelvin S.B. Schilperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual, A6. Kluwer Academic Publisher, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1988: 1-10Google Scholar). For DNA gel blot analysis, 10 μg of DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed in a 0.7% agarose gel and blotted onto Nytran membranes. RNA and DNA gel blots were probed with the entire cDNA insert or with the first 300 base pairs of cDNA (internalPst I fragment), which was radiolabeled by random priming using T7 polymerase (Pharmacia). Hybridization and washing conditions of filters were done at high stringency (70 °C) as described (17Church G. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7267) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesis, quantification of the products, and reverse transcriptase-mediated PCR were conducted as described (22An Y.-Q. Huang S. McDowell J.M. McKinney E.C. Meagher R.B. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 15-30PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers (50 pmol each), op9-PCR1 (5′-CTCGGCCATGTAGCCAAT-3′) and op9-PCR2 (5′-TCTTCAAACAACTGTG-3′) were used to PCR amplify an internal region of the in vitro synthesized single-stranded cDNA from the different mRNA sources in a Perkin-Elmer DNA Cycler. PCR amplification was programmed for 30 cycles, with each cycle consisting of 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, and 70 °C for 1.5 min. The amplified DNA fragments were visualized in agarose gels or alternatively hybridized with a radiolabeled p9 cDNA probe. The inability of these primer pairs to amplify the closely related P69A protease sequence was confirmed in control PCR reactions that included 10 ng of plasmid DNA containing the P69A cDNA as template. Positive controls were carried out in parallel reactions containing 10 ng of plasmid DNA containing the P69B cDNA. Aiming to resolve proteolytic activities induced in tomato plants upon infection with citrus exocortis viroid, leaf tissue homogenates were fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B columns. Fig. 1 (left panel) shows chromatographic elution profiles derived from tissue homogenates from healthy and citrus exocortis viroid-infected plants after elution with a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl. Two remarkable differences in proteolytic activities were observed between both of them when fluorescein isothiocyanate-casein was used as substrate for the determination of proteolytic activities. In profiles from viroid-infected plants (Fig. 1 B, left), the appearance of two different peaks of proteolytic activity were observed when compared with the proteolytic profile from healthy plants (Fig. 1 A, left): (a) peak I (eluting with the washing buffer) and (b) peak II (eluting at 0.08 m NaCl) (Fig.1 B, left panel). Analysis by SDS-PAGE of proteins present in the corresponding column fractions revealed differences in the protein profiles. In the case of viroid-infected plants (Fig. 1 D, right panel) the appearance of a major set of proteins corresponding to the previously identified inducible PR proteins (15Vera P. Conejero V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 323-334Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was observed. These proteins eluted in the void volume fractions, matched peak I of proteolytic activity, and contained the characteristic 69-kDa protein band previously identified as a source of proteolytic activity (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 14Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Vera P. Conejero V. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 34: 323-334Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of proteins in column fractions corresponding to peak II from infected plants did not revealed major differences when compared with healthy controls, except in an additional 69-kDa protein band which was not detected in the equivalent column fractions derived from healthy plants. The inducible nature and close similarity in molecular mass of the detected 69-kDa proteins in peak I and II prompted us to search for immunological relationship between each other. Pooled proteins recovered in peak I and II, and the corresponding pooled proteins from healthy controls, were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-P69 antisera (Fig. 2). This revealed that the antibodies specifically immunodecorated the 69-kDa protein bands present in both peak I and II fractions from infected plants, while no inmunodecoration was observed in the corresponding fractions from healthy plants. Since the chromatographic separation was based on the net surface charge of the proteins, the partitioning of these two distinct immnunoreactive 69-kDa polypeptides favored the idea that the previously identified P69 proteinase present in crude homogenates from viroid-infected plants (14Vera P. Conejero V. Plant Physiol. 1988; 87: 58-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was in fact a mixture of two different isoenzymes with similar biochemical and immunological properties but with different chromatographic behavior.Figure 2Specificity of anti-P69 antibodies toward pooled proteins present in proteolytic activity peaks I and II from infected plants (I) or the equivalent fractions from healthy (H) plants. Mr markers are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the criteria of close immunological relationship between these two viroid-inducible 69-kDa proteinases, we attempted cloning of the new P69 member by screening with antibodies and also by screening at low stringency hybridization with the p26 cDNA clone previously described (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) as a probe, in cDNA libraries from viroid-infected tomato. Immunoscreening of a λ-ZAP cDNA library from viroid-infected tomato plants (16Vera P. Tornero P. Conejero V. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 790-794PubMed Google Scholar) did not render any good result (not shown). Conversely, hybridization-based screening of the same cDNA library with a radiolabeled p26 cDNA probe rendered a total of nine cross-hybridizing cDNA clones. Restriction endonuclease mapping and partial sequence analysis of all these cDNA clones indicated that 6 of them represented the previously identified P69 gene, while the remaining 3 cDNA clones represented a different gene. One of these latter cDNAs (p9 cDNA clone) was selected and analyzed in detail. The nucleotide sequence and the derived amino acid sequence predicted from the only open reading frame present in p9 are shown in Fig. 3. The cDNA insert contains 2407 nucleotides (excluding the poly(A) tail), and RNA gel blot using the p9 cDNA as a probe gave a band of 2.5 kilobases in size (see below), indicating that the p9 cDNA clone is an almost full-length clone. The open reading frame starts with an ATG codon at position 11–13 that is surrounded by nucleotide sequences that matches the consensus sequence conserved for translation initiation in eukaryotes (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2382) Google Scholar), and ends at the TAG stop codon at position 2246–2248 of the cDNA. The open reading frame is preceded by an in-frame stop codon reinforcing the assumption that the most likely 5′-Met initiation codon is that located at position 11–13. The encoded protein has a predicted molecular weight of 78,992 and a total of 745 amino acids, which is larger that the 69-kDa proteins recognized by antibodies (see Fig. 2). This was further verified by in vitro transcription-translation experiments of the p9 cDNA in rabbit reticulocytes which render the synthesis of an about 80-kDa protein (data not shown). However, the hydropathy profile of the derived sequence (data not shown) and computer based comparison of amino acid sequence of the NH2 terminus indicated the existence of a preprosequence. This consists of a hydrophobic signal peptide at the extreme NH2 terminus. The “(−3,−1) rule,” as proposed by von Heijne (24Von Heijne G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), predicts cleavage of this signal peptide after Ser-22. This is followed by a 92-amino acid prosequence which is a typical feature of proteases of the subtilisin family and for which, the proteolytic removal of the prosequence is an important step in the generation of the active protease from the inactive zymogen (25Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The putative NH2-terminal amino acid of the mature protein is Thr, identified by comparison with other plant subtilisin-like proteases (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and is indicated in Fig. 3. Thus, the predicted mature enzyme contains 631 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 66,138. The amino acid composition predicted for this mature protein is consistent with that determined previously for the P69 proteinase (86% identical), and this structural similarity explains the observed cross-reacting of each other when using anti-P69 antibodies upon ion-exchange chromatography fractionation. For the sake of uniformity we will refer to this newly identified P69 proteinase as P69B, while the previously identified one will be designed as P69A. The amino acid sequence comparison of P69B with that of P69A is illustrated in Fig.4 A.Figure 4Sequence alignment analyses of the P69B polypeptide with other subtilisin-like homologues. A, the sequence of the P69B isoform is given with sequence differences found in the P69A isoform written below. The propeptide regions areboxed and the amino acids forming the catalytic triad in the active site (D, aspartate; H, histidine;S, serine) and the conserved N (asparagine) residue are marked by asterisks.

Catalytic residues are indicated byasterisks. Amino acid residues of each protease are numbered from the precursor sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Within the mature P69B protein the amino acid residues Asp-146, His-203, and Ser-531, common to all subtilisin-like proteases, were identified. The sequences surrounding the catalytic sites (catalytic triad) are similar to the catalytic triad essential for all of the subtilisin-like members to function as proteases, and highest when compared with P69A (Fig. 4, A and B). Also the protein has an Asn residue (Asn-305) that has been found to be highly conserved in this position and is catalytically important in the subtilisins (28Barr P.J. Cell. 1991; 66: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 29Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the similarities around the amino acids of the active center, there is an insertion of a long sequence (226 amino acids) between the stabilizing Asn-305 and the reactive Ser-531 relative to all other subtilisin-like proteases, which are separated by much shorter distances. This displacement has also been observed in the three other subtilisin-like proteinases recently identified from plants (11Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The meaning of such a displacement remains unknown, but at face value it could represent a characteristic signature of the subtilisin enzymes from plants. The differential expression pattern of P69B was determined in different tissues from healthy and viroid-infected plants by Northern blot hybridization. The filters were hybridized at high stringency with the radiolabeled p9 cDNA insert. The results revealed that the level of P69B mRNA, which has a size of 2.5 kilobases, is increased markedly in leaf, stem, and less in root tissue from infected plants, while the corresponding mRNA preparations derived from healthy plants (mock-inoculated plants) showed a very weak cross-hybridization with the radiolabeled probe and only after prolonged exposure of the filter with the film (Fig. 5). The possibility that the observed increases in P69B gene expression in infected tissues could be masked by cross-hybridization with the mRNA for the previously identified P69A gene was also entertained. Gene-specific RT-PCR reactions provided an alternative approach to verify that the expression of the newly identify P69B gene was indeed induced in infected plants (Fig. 6). In vitro synthesized single-stranded cDNAs from mRNA samples of leaves, stems, and roots from either healthy or viroid-infected plants were assayed by PCR in a 2-fold dilution series. Amplification with primers designed to render a 1202-base pair PCR product (oligonucleotide op9-PCR1 and op9-PCR2), and specific for internal sequences of P69B but not for the P69A gene, were used in these reactions to specifically detect P69B gene expression. Fig. 6 shows an example of the RT-PCR data. RNA preparations from leaf, stem, and root tissues of viroid-infected tomato plants, but not the equivalent RNA preparations of healthy plants, produced the expected 1200-base pair size product. The derived PCR products were also confirmed by Southern blot analysis with a radiolabeled p9 cDNA probe (data not shown). As a control, plasmids containing the P69B cDNA or theP69A cDNA were amplified under similar conditions and only the plasmid containing the P69B cDNA render the expected size PCR product (Fig. 6). This further sustains that the RT-PCR products observed using these primers wereP69B-specific and also support that P69B is induced during pathogenesis. The absence of amplified PCR products in samples from healthy plants suggests that the weak cross-hybridizing mRNA species observed in Northern blots from healthy plants may represent expression of different subtilisin-like members with other housekeeping functions. To further characterize the existence of other P69-related genes in tomato plants, more extensive analysis was completed using genomic DNA and cDNA probes. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis, shown in Fig. 7, was performed to determine the extent of complexity of the P69-encoding genes. A blot containing tomato genomic DNA digested with several restriction enzymes was probed with the entire p9 cDNA and demonstrated the presence of a very large number of cross-hybridizing fragments and of different hybridization intensities (Fig. 7,left), suggesting that P69 may conform a large multigene family of high complexity. This high complexity was also observed, but at a reduced scale, when a similar digested DNA was hybridized with a cDNA probe encompassing only the preprodomain sequence, excluding the catalytic domain (Fig. 7, right). Since none of the restriction enzymes used in this experiment cut within the preproregion, this result enables us to likely estimate that the P69 gene family is composed of at least se"
https://openalex.org/W1988127541,"Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 2 (GCAP-2) is a recoverin-like calcium-binding protein that regulates photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) (Dizhoor, A. M., and Hurley, J. B. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19346–19350). It was reported that myristoylation of a related protein, GCAP-1, was critical for its affinity for RetGC (Frins, S., Bonigk, W., Muller, F., Kellner, R., and Koch, K.-W. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 8022–8027). We demonstrate that the N terminus of GCAP-2, like those of other members of the recoverin family of Ca2+-binding proteins, is fatty acylated. However, unlike other proteins of this family, more GCAP-2 is present in the membrane fraction at low Ca2+ than at high Ca2+ concentrations. We investigated the role of the N-terminal fatty acyl residue in the ability of GCAP-2 to regulate RetGCs. Myristoylated or nonacylated GCAP-2 forms were expressed inEscherichia coli. Wild-type GCAP-2 and the Gly2→ Ala2 GCAP-2 mutant, which is unable to undergo N-terminal myristoylation, were also expressed in mammalian HEK293 cells. We found that compartmentalization of GCAP-2 in photoreceptor outer segment membranes is Ca2+- and ionic strength-sensitive, but it does not require the presence of the fatty acyl group and does not necessarily directly reflect GCAP-2 interaction with RetGC. The lack of myristoylation does not significantly affect the ability of GCAP-2 to stimulate RetGC. Nor does it affect the ability of the Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 to compete with the GCAP-2 mutant that constitutively activates RetGC. We conclude that while Ca2+ binding plays a major regulatory role in GCAP-2 function, it does not operate through a calcium-myristoyl switch similar to the one found in recoverin. Guanylyl cyclase-activating protein 2 (GCAP-2) is a recoverin-like calcium-binding protein that regulates photoreceptor guanylyl cyclase (RetGC) (Dizhoor, A. M., and Hurley, J. B. (1996)J. Biol.

We found that compartmentalization of GCAP-2 in photoreceptor outer segment membranes is Ca2+- and ionic strength-sensitive, but it does not require the presence of the fatty acyl group and does not necessarily directly reflect GCAP-2 interaction with RetGC. The lack of myristoylation does not significantly affect the ability of GCAP-2 to stimulate RetGC. Nor does it affect the ability of the Ca2+-loaded form of GCAP-2 to compete with the GCAP-2 mutant that constitutively activates RetGC. We conclude that while Ca2+ binding plays a major regulatory role in GCAP-2 function, it does not operate through a calcium-myristoyl switch similar to the one found in recoverin.

In darkness these channels allow Ca2+ influx, but light-induced closure of the channels lowers free intracellular Ca2+ because Ca2+ is continuously extruded from the OS by a light-independent Na+/K+, Ca2+ exchanger.

However, the question which of the two cyclases can be a target for any particular GCAP in vivo has not yet been properly addressed. Additional factors may also be involved in regulation of RetGCs, such as sodium concentration in the intracellular medium (25Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P.

At free Ca2+concentrations similar to the levels in dark-adapted vertebrate photoreceptors, GCAP-2 is not only unable to activate RetGCs, but it also inhibits RetGC. Therefore, GCAP-2 can be considered as a RetGCregulator rather than activator protein (1Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

For mammalian retinal proteins, this acylation is heterogeneous (C14:0, C14:1, C14:2, and C12:0) (31Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E. Zozulya S. Neubert T.A. Stryer L.

While all C14 derivatives altogether can constitute up to 75% of the total amount of fatty acyl residues, myristoyl itself represents only as much as 25% of it (32Neubert T.A. Johnson R.S.

The affinity of recoverin-like proteins for membranes increases as a result of fatty acyl group exposure in response to the protein transition into its calcium-bound conformation (35Zozulya S.

Bonigk W. Muller F. Kellner R. Koch K.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8022-8027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated whether or not the N-terminal fatty acylation of GCAP-2 is essential for RetGC regulation. We found that GCAP-2 is fatty acylated but that its affinity for membranes is affected by Ca2+ in a manner opposite to that of other recoverin-like proteins. It associates with membranes at low Ca2+ concentrations more efficiently than at high free Ca2+ concentrations. We also demonstrate that neither membrane association of GCAP-2 nor various aspects of RetGC regulation by GCAP-2 require fatty acylation. We therefore conclude that Ca2+ induces a conformational change in GCAP-2 protein but that the calcium-myristoyl switch found in other members of the recoverin family is not essential for the ability of GCAP-2 to regulate RetGCs. We also describe an efficient bacterial expression system for producing functional myristoylated and nonacylated GCAP-2. GCAP-2 was isolated from a heat-stable fraction of retinal proteins using immunoaffinity chromatography on monospecific polyclonal ΔNp24 antibodies coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B as described previously (10Dizhoor A.M.

Purified GCAP-2 had no detectable GCAP-1 in it as assayed by immunoblot.

Fresh overnight 5-ml cultures of expression cells were diluted in 500 ml of standard LB media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin or both 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (for pBB131-containing strains).

The insoluble material was washed three times with a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA, 7 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm PMSF, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A) by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. GCAP-2 was extracted from the pellet by homogenization in buffer A containing 100 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 6 m freshly deionized urea for 30 min at 4 °C and dialyzed twice against 300–1000 volumes of buffer A overnight at 4 °C. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 10 minutes. Recombinant protein was then purified by gel filtration on a Sephacryl S100 column in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 10 mm mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing GCAP-2 were combined and concentrated using Amicon YM10 membranes under nitrogen pressure to 2 mg/ml final concentration. Concentrated protein was used either immediately or after being quickly frozen in small aliquots and stored at −70 °C. Myristoylated and nonacylated EF(2/3/4)− GCAP-2 mutant, which carried substitutions E80Q/E116Q/D158N (1Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

For their functional comparisons, different GCAP-2 forms were always expressed simultaneously and purified in parallel. ESI-MS of GCAP-2 was performed essentially as described previously for recoverin using a Sciex API III triple quadrupole instrument (31Dizhoor A.M. Ericsson L.H. Johnson R.S. Kumar S. Olshevskaya E.

For GCAP-2 extraction experiments, a fraction of OS was isolated from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas using sucrose gradient centrifugation (43McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and rhodopsin concentration was determined by measuring absorbance of an aliquot diluted in 1% Ammonix LO detergent at 500 nm before and after bleaching, using ε500 = 40,000. OS typically diluted at 1 mg/ml of rhodopsin were homogenized in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm PMSF, and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin (buffer B) containing 1 mm Ca-EGTA buffers using a Dounce glass-to-glass homogenizer equipped with pestle B. Only freshly isolated membranes could be used for these experiments. Homogenate was centrifuged at 80,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman T 100.1 rotor. The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer. Ten microliters of soluble and membrane fractions were mixed with an equal volume of Laemmli SDS sample buffer containing 2 mm EGTA, boiled, and loaded onto 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The addition of EGTA in sample buffer prevents the appearance of bands of Ca2+-bound GCAP-2, which have higher mobility than its Ca2+-free form. After electrophoresis, GCAP-2 bands were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet, stained with a ΔNp24 antibody, and developed using goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate and an Amersham ECL chemiluminescent reagent. Fluorograms of GCAP-2 bands within the quasilinear range of density were scanned using a Bio-Rad model GS-670 imaging densitometer and quantified using Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst software. For reconstitution experiments, OS membranes were first washed six times with buffer B and then incubated typically at 2.5 mg/ml rhodopsin with 2 μm recombinant GCAP-2 and 1 mm Ca-EGTA in 200 μl for 30 min at room temperature in buffer B containing 50 mm Tris-HCl. The mixture was centrifuged as indicated above, and the pellet was gently rinsed with the corresponding incubation buffer, resuspended in such buffer, and repelleted. The final pellet typically containing approximately 10% of total protein was resuspended in the original volume of water, and aliquots of membranes were analyzed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel as described above. Washed membranes incubated without added GCAP-2 were used in these experiments as controls to ensure that no endogenous protein was left in the membranes. Fresh mouse liver was homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm PMSF and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min. Membranes were resuspended in the same buffer without sucrose and washed three times by centrifugation. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad BCA protein assay kit. Bovine retinas were homogenized in a blender with chloroform/methanol solution for 5 min at the following volume proportions: 1.5 retinal tissue, 3.73 methanol, 1.87 chloroform. After homogenization, water (1.9 volume) and chloroform (1.9 volume) were added to the mixture. In 20 min, the organic phase was collected, further separated from the remainders of aqueous phase by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min in glass centrifuge tubes, and collected using Pasteur pipettes. Lipids were dried under a constant stream of argon at room temperature, dispersed in liposome buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), flushed with argon, and sonicated for 30 s. A fraction of liposomes sedimenting at 20,000 ×g was collected by three cy"
https://openalex.org/W2082218239,"We and others have recently cloned a non-receptor, calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK; also known as PYK2, CAKbeta, and RAFTK) that shares both overall domain structure and 45% amino acid identity with p125(FAK). We have studied the signaling, activation, and potential function of these related enzymes in GN4 rat liver epithelial cells that express CADTK and p125(FAK) at roughly similar levels. p125(FAK) is nearly fully tyrosine-phosphorylated in resting GN4 cells. In contrast, while CADTK is not tyrosine-autophosphorylated in untreated cells, angiotensin II increases CADTK Tyr(P) by 5-10-fold. With regard to signaling, CADTK activation is correlated with stimulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p70(S6K) pathways but not with the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase or p90(RSK). In this report we assessed the contribution of CADTK and p125(FAK) to tyrosine phosphorylation of focal contact proteins. In adherent GN4 cells, the constitutive activity of p125(FAK) was correlated with basal paxillin, tensin, and p130(CAS) tyrosine phosphorylation. A rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of each protein was detected after treatment with angiotensin II or other agonists that stimulate CADTK; the prolonged 3-4-fold increase in paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation was the most substantial change. In the WB cell line that expresses 3-fold less CADTK than GN4 cell line agonist-dependent paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation is similarly reduced. Immunoprecipitation of CADTK from GN4 cells revealed CADTK. paxillin complexes that persisted in 500 mM NaCl but not in 0.1% SDS cell lysis buffer. The complexes were largely independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation state of either protein. Surprisingly, we did not detect p125(FAK).paxillin complexes in immunoprecipitates using either of two p125(FAK) antibodies. When CADTK and p125(FAK) were transiently overexpressed in 293(T) cells, both enzymes associated with paxillin, but the avidity of CADTK appeared to be greater. In addition, in transfected 293(T) cells, complexes between CADTK and another potential substrate, p130(CAS), were detected. In summary, in GN4 rat liver epithelial cells stimulation of CADTK was highly correlated with paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation; in addition, CADTK but not p125(FAK) was complexed to paxillin at detectable levels. This suggests that agonist-dependent cytoskeletal changes in epithelial cells might proceed, in part, by CADTK-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2038382454,"C173 and W125 are pet mutants ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae, partially deficient in cytochrome oxidase but with elevated concentrations of cytochrome c. Assays of electron transport chain enzymes indicate that the mutations exert different effects on the terminal respiratory pathway, including an inefficient transfer of electrons between thebc1 and the cytochrome oxidase complexes. A cloned gene capable of restoring respiration in C173/U1 and W125 is identical to reading frame YGR112w of yeast chromosome VII (GenBankZ72897). The encoded protein is homologous to the product of the mammalian SURF-1 gene. In view of the homology, the yeast gene has been designated SHY1 (SurfHomolog of Yeast). An antibody against the carboxyl-terminal half of Shy1p has been used to localize the protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Deletion of part ofSHY1 produces a phenotype similar to that of G91 mutants. Disruption of SHY1 at a Bam HI site, located approximately 2/3 of the way into the gene, has no obvious phenotypic consequence. This evidence, together with the ability of a carboxyl-terminal coding sequence starting from the Bam HI site to complement a shy1 mutant, suggests that the Shy1p contains two domains that can be separately expressed to form a functional protein."
https://openalex.org/W2008335672,"To test the hypothesis that tRNATyr recognition differs between bacterial and human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases, we sequenced several clones identified as human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNAs by the Human Genome Project. We found that human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is composed of three domains: 1) an amino-terminal Rossmann fold domain that is responsible for formation of the activated E·Tyr-AMP intermediate and is conserved among bacteria, archeae, and eukaryotes; 2) a tRNA anticodon recognition domain that has not been conserved between bacteria and eukaryotes; and 3) a carboxyl-terminal domain that is unique to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and whose primary structure is 49% identical to the putative human cytokine endothelial monocyte-activating protein II, 50% identical to the carboxyl-terminal domain of methionyl-tRNA synthetase from Caenorhabditis elegans, and 43% identical to the carboxyl-terminal domain of Arc1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The first two domains of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase are 52, 36, and 16% identical to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases from S. cerevisiae,Methanococcus jannaschii, and Bacillus stearothermophilus, respectively. Nine of fifteen amino acids known to be involved in the formation of the tyrosyl-adenylate complex in B. stearothermophilus are conserved across all of the organisms, whereas amino acids involved in the recognition of tRNATyr are not conserved. Kinetic analyses of recombinant human and B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases expressed in Escherichia coli indicate that human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase aminoacylates human but not B. stearothermophilus tRNATyr, and vice versa, supporting the original hypothesis. It is proposed that like endothelial monocyte-activating protein II and the carboxyl-terminal domain of Arc1p, the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase evolved from gene duplication of the carboxyl-terminal domain of methionyl-tRNA synthetase and may direct tRNA to the active site of the enzyme.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNA by their cognate amino acid. For most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (E), tRNA aminoacylation can be separated into two steps: formation of a stable enzyme-bound aminoacyladenylate intermediate (E·AA-AMP, Equation 1), followed by transfer of the amino acid (AA) from the aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate to the 3′ end of the tRNA substrate (Equation 2).E + AA + ATP ⇄ E⋅AA-AMP + PPiEquation 1 E⋅AA-AMP + tRNA ⇄ E + AA-tRNA + AMPEquation 2 The 20 different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases fall into two distinct structural classes (1Eriani G.

Biol. 1992; 2: 138-142Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (of which tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is a member) are characterized by a structurally well conserved amino-terminal Rossmann fold domain which contains the signature sequences “HIGH” and “KMSKS” (3Webster T.A.

In contrast, the carboxyl-terminal domains of class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are structurally diverse suggesting that the primordial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase consisted solely of the amino-terminal Rossmann fold (5Brunie S.

Both x-ray crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis of class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases indicate that the amino-terminal domains are responsible for catalyzing the first step of the aminoacylation reaction and recognizing the 3′ end of the tRNA substrate, whereas the carboxyl-terminal domain is responsible for recognition of the anticodon loop of the tRNA substrate (6Rould M.A. Perona J.J.

Transfer RNA molecules also occur as one of two distinct types, although there does not appear to be a correlation between the two types of tRNA molecules and the two classes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Tyrosyl-tRNA (tRNATyr) is unique among tRNAs in that in bacteria it is type II (which contains an extended variable loop), whereas in eukaryotes it is type I (16Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12855-12863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies indicate that bacterial and eukaryotic tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases do not catalyze the aminoacylation of other tRNATyr substrates suggesting that tRNATyrrecognition differs between bacteria and eukaryotes (17Chow C.M.

If this hypothesis is correct, it should be possible to exploit this species specificity to design novel antibiotics that selectively inhibit bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases. To test this hypothesis, we have sequenced the cDNA for human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and expressed the recombinant protein in Escherichia coli cells. During the course of these investigations, it was discovered that the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase consists of three distinct domains, an amino-terminal Rossmann fold domain, an anticodon recognition domain, and an idiosyncratic carboxyl-terminal domain whose amino acid sequence is 49% identical to the putative human cytokine endothelial monocyte-activating protein II (EMAP II), 1The abbreviations used areEMAP IIendothelial monocyte-activating protein II;Ni-NTAnickel-nitriloacetic acid. 50% identical to the carboxyl-terminal domain of methionyl-tRNA synthetase from Caenorhabditis elegans, and 43% identical to the Arc1p protein (also known as G4p1), which has been postulated to direct tRNA to active sites of the methionyl- and glutamyl-tRNA synthetases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22Simos G.

The results of these analyses and possible implications of the findings are presented here. endothelial monocyte-activating protein II; nickel-nitriloacetic acid. cDNA clones 53277 and 124918 (I.M.A.G.E. clone accession numbers) were obtained from the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (23Lennon G.G. Auffrey C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). All other cDNA clones were obtained from The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR) through the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and are designated by their TIGR clone numbers. Reagents and vectors were purchased from the following sources: pET-30a vector and S-Tag Western blot kit (Novagen), Ni-NTA resin and QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), Wizard PCR prep system and recombinant enterokinase (Promega), NuSieve low melting point agarose (FMC),Taq polymerase (Amersham),l-[14C]tyrosine (Moravek Biochemicals), and oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.). Automated DNA sequencing was performed by the DNA sequencing facility at Iowa State University using dye-labeled dideoxy terminators. All other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Fisher. All plasmids were purified on CsCl gradients (24Radloff R. Bauer W. Vinograd J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 57: 1514-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 25Birnboim H.C.

For clone 186313 and the pHYTS1 expression plasmid, both DNA strands were sequenced using the following primers 2The first seven primers are complementary to the antisense strand of the cDNA, and the remaining six primers are complementary to the sense strand; positions of the 3′ ends of each primer relative to the ATG start codon are indicated in parentheses following the primer; all primers except HYTS Exp Fwd and HYTS Exp Rvs are 18 to 21 nucleotides in length.: M13 reverse primer (−190), HYTS Exp Fwd (21Quinn C.L.

For all other clones, the sense strand was sequenced in entirety, and ambiguities in the sequences were resolved by sequencing the appropriate regions of the complementary strand. SeqEd (v1.0.3, Applied Biosystems) was used to align overlapping sequences, assess the quality of the sequencing results, and determine the consensus sequence for each cDNA. Data base searching was performed using the European Bioinformatics Institute implementation of FASTA (26Pearson W.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 365-389PubMed Google Scholar), the Stanford University implementation of BLAST (27Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

All data base searches and multiple sequence alignments used the default parameters for each program implementation. Subcloning of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNA from clone 186313 into the pET-30a vector for expression of recombinant tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase protein in E. coli was performed in the following manner. First, the full-length human tyrosyl-tRNA cDNA from clone 186313 was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with the HYTS Exp Fwd and HYTS Exp Rvs primers described above. These primers containBgl II and Hin dIII sites near their 5′ termini, respectively. Following amplification, the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNA was gel-purified, digested with Bgl II and Hin dIII, and ligated into a pET-30a(+) vector that had been previously digested with Bam HI and Hin dIII. The resulting plasmid, designated pHYTS1, contained an in-frame gene fusion between the 44-amino acid amino-terminal His-tag/S-tag leader sequence present in the pET-30a(+) vector and the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNA. Both strands of pHYTS1 were sequenced, and a single A to T point mutation was found at nucleotide 1000 (converting a lysyl codon into an isoleucyl codon in the mRNA sequence). To correct this mutation clone 186313 was digested with Bam HI and Nhe I, and the fragment corresponding to nucleotides 963–1582 was purified on 1.5% agarose. This 620-base pair fragment was ligated into pHYTS1 that had been digested with Bam HI and Nhe I. The resulting construct, designated pHYTS2, was sequenced to ensure that its nucleotide sequence is identical to the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase sequence found in clone 186313. BL21DE3 pLysS E. coli cells harboring the pHYTS2 plasmid were grown to saturation at 37 °C in 2 × TY medium containing 50 μg/liter kanamycin and 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was harvested as described by Qiagen (protocol 5 in the QIAexpressionist). Briefly, this involved lysing the cells and binding the His-tagged recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase to Ni-NTA resin. After washing the Ni-NTA resin with 50 mmsodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 6.0 buffer, recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was eluted from the column using a step gradient from 0 to 0.5 m imidazole. Recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was then dialyzed against buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate (to remove any enzyme-bound tyrosyl adenylate) and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, followed by three changes of buffer A without sodium pyrophosphate. The final dialysis buffer contained 10% glycerol. B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was purified from TG2 cells harboring the pYTS5 plasmid as described previously (31First E.A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13651-13657Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concentrations of human and B. stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases were determined by active site titration usingl-[14C]tyrosine to monitor tyrosyl-adenylate formation (32Wilkinson A.J. Fersht A.R. Blow D.M. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and modified Western blot analysis using the S-Tag Western blot kit (34Kim J.-S. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) were used to assess the purity of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases and to estimate the molecular weight of the recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. B. stearothermophilus tRNATyr was transcribed in vitro from pGFX-WT, a derivative of the plasmid pGAG2 (35Avis J.M. Day A.G. Garcia G.A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5312-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in which a Fok I restriction site replaces the Bst NI cleavage site in pGAG2 such that digestion with Fok I, and subsequent in vitro transcription of the digested pGFX-WT plasmid by T7 RNA polymerase, produces tRNATyr containing an intact -CCA 3′ terminus. Details of the construction of the pGFX-WT plasmid will be published elsewhere. Three consecutive rounds of polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K.

Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6832) Google Scholar) were used to replace the B. stearothermophilus tRNATyr cDNA in pGFX-WT with the cDNA sequence for human placental tRNATyr (GenBankTM accession number Hstrny1r), generating the pHYR-WT plasmid. Digestion of pHYR-WT by Fok I, followed by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase, yields the human tRNATyr product.In vitro transcription of the B. stearothermophilus and human tRNATyr substrates from the pGFX-WT and pHYR-WT plasmids was performed as described by Aviset al. (35Avis J.M. Day A.G. Garcia G.A. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5312-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) with the modification that the plasmids were digested with Fok I rather than Bst NI. In vitro transcribed tRNATyr products were purified on 12% polyacrylamide gels (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Purified tRNATyrproducts were resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water containing 10 mm MgCl2, heated to 75 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature over a period of 30–60 min to allow annealing of the tRNATyr substrates to occur. To ensure that the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNA used in subsequent experiments corresponds to the predominant form found in humans, cDNAs from several different libraries were sequenced. Specifically, the following cDNAs were sequenced 3Clone numbers refer to either the TIGR or I.M.A.G.E. Consortium accession numbers; clone source and tissues used to construct the cDNA libraries are shown in parentheses following the clone number.: 186313 (TIGR, adult white blood cells), 151265 (TIGR, female infant brain), 160622 (TIGR, adult white blood cells), 109082 (TIGR, adult colon), 4The sequences of the initial clones we received bearing these accession numbers did not correspond to their expressed sequence tag sequences.

Consortium, infant brain), and 124918 (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium, fetal liver, spleen). Clones 186313, 151265, and 160622 contain full-length cDNA sequences, clone 109082 is missing the first 181 nucleotides of the coding sequence, clone 132369 is missing the first 792 nucleotides of the coding sequence, clone 53277 is missing the first 426 nucleotides of the coding sequence, and the nucleotide sequence of clone 124918 corresponds to that of the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase cDNA coding sequence through nucleotide 685, and then diverges into an unrelated sequence. In all of the cDNA clones examined (with the exception of the truncated clone 124918), the nucleotide sequence differs from the previously reported cDNA sequence for human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 5C. L. Quinn, GenBankTM accession number U40714. (39Ribas De Pouplana L. Frugier M. Quinn C.L. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by the insertion of a cytosine at position 1061. This additional nucleotide base alters the reading frame of the cDNA sequence, which extends the open reading frame an additional 525 nucleotides. Within the coding sequence, we observed the following heterogeneity among the cDNA clones. In clone 151265, nucleotides A484 through C489 are absent, resulting in deletion of serine 161 and glycine 162 in the translated protein. Clone 160622 has a guanosine deleted at position 7 in the coding sequence and a thymine inserted at position 479, resulting in an open reading frame from nucleotide 631 to nucleotide 1584. If the hypothesis that tRNATyr recognition differs between eukaryotic and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases is correct, one would expect these differences to be reflected in both the nucleotide sequences of tRNATyr and the amino acid sequences of the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases. Comparison of tRNATyr sequences indicates that in bacteria, tRNATyr is a type II tRNA, whereas in eukaryotes tRNATyr is a type I tRNA (16Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 17Chow C.M. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12855-12863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the above hypothesis. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases further supports the above hypothesis. Human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase is 53% identical at the amino acid level to the S. cerevisiae homologue (excluding the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase), 36% identical to the homologue from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, and 16% identical to the B. stearothermophilus homologue (Fig.1). Notably, nine of the fifteen amino acids involved in stabilizing the transition state for the first step of the reaction in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme (11Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8031-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 40Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Bedouelle H. Winter G.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13658-13663Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are conserved in the human, M. jannaschii, and S. cerevisiae enzymes. In contrast, none of the eleven amino acids known to be involved in tRNATyr recognition (42Bedouelle H. Winter G. Nature. 1986; 320: 371-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 43Bedouelle H.

This is most apparent in the M. jannaschii amino acid sequence, which surprisingly is missing a substantial portion of the tRNATyr anticodon recognition domain (amino acids 330–419 in the B. stearothermophilus enzyme). FASTA and BLAST searches of the GenBankTMnucleotide sequence data base identified proteins with significant homology to the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. In particular, the EMAP II initially isolated from murine fibrosarcoma cells (48Kao J. Ryan J. Brett G. Chen J. Shen H. Fan Y.-G. Godman G. Familletti P.C. Wang F. Pan Y.-C.E. Stern D. Clauss M. J.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) were found to be 49, 50, and 43% identical to the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase at the amino acid sequence level (Fig. 2). In addition, the carboxyl-terminal domains of methionyl-tRNA synthetases from bacterial sources show more limited homologies to the carboxyl-terminal domain of human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. The sequence similarities observed between Arc1p, EMAP II, and the methionyl-tRNA synthetases have been previously reported (50Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20692-20697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EMAP II has recently been found to be identical to the p18 protein component of the 24 S aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex found in mammalian cells. 6M. Mirande, personal communication. To quantify the similarity between the amino acid sequences for the carboxyl-terminal domains of the human tyrosyl- and methionyl-tRNA synthetases, we analyzed expressed sequence tags that have been putatively identified as the carboxyl-terminal domains of human methionyl-tRNA synthetase (I.M.A.G.E. clone accession numbers 33689, L1914, and 46655). The nucleotide sequence of the carboxyl-terminal domain of tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was 100% identical to a consensus sequence of these expressed sequence tags, suggesting that the ESTs have been incorrectly assigned due to the similarity of their sequences to the C. elegans methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The recent finding that, in contrast to the C. elegans enzyme, the human methionyl-tRNA synthetase does not have an EMAP II-like domain at its carboxyl terminus is consistent with this hypothesis. To further characterize the human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, the cDNA sequence from clone 186313 was subcloned into the pET-30a vector, and the resulting plasmid was designated pHYTS2. Recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase purified from BL21DE3 pLysS cells harboring pHYTS2 contains both a His-tag and an S-tag on its amino terminus (34Kim J.-S. Raines R.T.

Chem. 1988; 263: 7211-7215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the recombinant human tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase at various stages of purification is shown in Fig. 3. Based on its mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the recombinant protein has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65,500 Da. This is in good agreement with the predicted molecular mass of 69,773 Da and previously published molecular mass estimates for other mammalian tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases (18Clark Jr., J.M. Eyzaguirre J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Wolfson A.D. Motorin Y.A. Ribkinska T.I. Beresten S.F. J. Chromatogr. 1990; 503: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and indicates that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the recombinant enzyme is translated in E. coli. Active site titration confirms that the purified recombinant enzyme is active and able to form the E·Tyr-AMP intermediate (data not shown). To determine whether there are mechanistic differences in the way human and bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases recognize and aminoacylate their cognate tRNA substrates, tRNATyr substrates corresponding to tRNATyr from B. stearothermophilus (35Avis J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2031462677,"The FET3 gene product ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential component of the high affinity iron transport system. Based on FET3 sequence homology to the multicopper oxidase family and iron oxidation studies in spheroplasts (De Silva, D. M., Askwith, C. C., Eide, D., and Kaplan, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1098–1101), it was hypothesized that the Fet3 protein (Fet3p) was a cell surface ferroxidase. To further characterize the protein, we have isolated Fet3p from yeast membranes and purified the protein to apparent homogeneity. Consistent with its localization at the plasma membrane, Fet3p is a glycosylated protein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the protein was present in two differentially glycosylated forms of approximately 120 and 100 kDa. Purified Fet3p is a copper-containing protein that is able to catalyze the oxidation of a variety of organic compounds in addition to ferrous iron. Azide and metal chelators strongly inhibited enzyme activity. Iron appeared to be the best substrate for the enzyme, and the apparentKm for ferrous oxidation was 2 μm. Interestingly, Fet3p was able to effectively catalyze the incorporation of iron onto apotransferrin. We conclude that Fet3p is a ferro-O2-oxidoreductase in yeast, homologous to the human plasma protein ceruloplasmin. The FET3 gene product ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential component of the high affinity iron transport system.

Interestingly, Fet3p was able to effectively catalyze the incorporation of iron onto apotransferrin. We conclude that Fet3p is a ferro-O2-oxidoreductase in yeast, homologous to the human plasma protein ceruloplasmin. Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes multiple pathways for iron acquisition. The low affinity iron transport system comprising theFET4 gene product also transports other metals in addition to iron (1Dix D.R. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26092-26099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high Km (30 μm) of the FET4 transporter for iron restricts the activity of this system to iron-rich growth conditions. A high affinity (Km = 0.15 μm) iron transport system is induced in response to iron deprivation and is extremely specific for iron. This transport system is coded for by two genes,FET3 and FTR1. Expression of these genes is necessary and sufficient for iron transport. Mutations in either gene abrogate transport, and forced iron-independent expression of both genes allows transport (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A.

Both the high and low affinity transport systems depend on an active plasma membrane ferrireductase complex (4Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol.

Studies indicate that Fet3p 1The abbreviations used are:Fet3pFet3 proteinFtr1pFtr1 proteinpPDp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloridePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisYPDyeast extract-peptone-dextrose and Ftr1p act as a ferroxidase-permease complex. The role of Fet3p as an oxidase is suggested by two lines of data. First, sequence analysis ofFET3 shows homology to the multicopper oxidase family of proteins that includes ascorbate oxidase, plant and fungal laccases, and the mammalian enzyme ceruloplasmin (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). These proteins catalyze the 4-electron reduction of dioxygen to water coupled to the oxidation of a variety of organic substrates. Enzymatic catalysis of the oxidation of ferrous to ferric ions is unique to ceruloplasmin. This ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin is essential for its function in vivo, which is to mobilize tissue iron stores and load iron onto apotransferrin for distribution throughout the body. It was shown recently that the genetic disorder aceruloplasminemia caused severe tissue iron overload in affected individuals (7Yoshida K. Furihata K. Takeda S. Nakamura A. Yamamoto K. Morita H. Hiyamuta S. Ikeda S. Shimizu N. Yanagisawa N. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 8Harris L.Z. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillvray R.T.A. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Although Fet3p has greater homology to ascorbate oxidase than ceruloplasmin, the essential role of Fet3p in iron transport led us to hypothesize that it has ferroxidase activity (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The second line of evidence indicating that Fet3p is a ferroxidase is based on the observation that yeasts exhibit a FET3-dependent oxygen consumption in the presence of iron (9De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Oxygen consumption was dependent upon functional Fet3p and could be reduced by copper depletion or by the addition of anti-Fet3p antibodies to yeast spheroplasts. Calculation of the stoichiometry of iron oxidation and oxygen consumption indicated a ratio of approximately 4:1 that is consistent with the action of a multicopper oxidase. Fet3 protein Ftr1 protein p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yeast extract-peptone-dextrose In an effort to further define the mechanism of high affinity iron transport, Fet3p has been purified to homogeneity, and its properties have been studied. Purified Fet3p is an oxidoreductase similar to other multicopper oxidases. We further demonstrate that in contrast to most multicopper oxidases, Fet3p has ferroxidase activity. Thus, Fet3p and ceruloplasmin (the only two multicopper oxidases known to be ferroxidases) may be functional homologues. The ability of ceruloplasmin to load iron onto apotransferrin is critical for itsin vivo function. We demonstrate that the oxidation of ferrous ions by Fet3p can also be coupled to the loading of apotransferrin. This observation suggests that a stable physical complex between the ferroxidase and the ferric acceptor may not be required for transfer of ferric iron. The yeast strain used in this study was F113:MATa ura3-52 inol1-1 (4Dancis A. Klausner R.D. Hinnebusch A.G. Barriocanal J.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 2294-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone (Difco Laboratories), and 2.5% glucose. Iron-limited medium YPD-bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was composed of YPD containing 80 μm bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate (Sigma) and 5 μm ferric chloride (Sigma). Tris-HCl and NaCl buffers were used throughout the purification of Fet3p and were supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: leupeptin (20 μm) and pepstatin A (10 μm), which were obtained from Sigma, and AEBSF (1 mm) from ICN. For Fet3p separation on Cu HiTrap columns and for oxidase assays, sodium acetate buffer (100 mm) was used at the indicated pH with no protease inhibitors present. Ferrous ammonium sulfate,p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, epinephrine, dopamine, and apotransferrin were obtained from Sigma and used as described in the legends to the figures. 40–70 liters of the F113 strain of S. cerevisiae were grown to saturation overnight in iron-limited medium, YPD-bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13578-13583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), containing 2.5% glucose. Cells were harvested and washed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl). A volume of glass beads equal to the volume of the pellet was added to the cells, which were frozen at −20 °C. Typically, between 500 and 800 g of yeast cells (wet weight) were used per purification. Frozen cells were thawed on ice and disrupted by vortexing for 30 s at maximum setting, followed by cooling on ice for 30 s. This procedure was repeated seven times. Homogenates were diluted 5-fold in lysis buffer and centrifuged 5 min at 4000 × g to pellet glass beads and cell debris. Supernatants were removed to fresh tubes, and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 20,000 × g. Pellets were washed once with lysis buffer and recentrifuged for 10 min at 20,000 × g. The pellets were solubilized in approximately 3 volumes of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 overnight on ice at 4 °C. Samples were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 100,000 ×g using a SW28 rotor in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge. Supernatants were pooled, filtered (0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter, Costar Corp.), and concentrated using an Amicon concentrator through a YM30 membrane. The concentrated sample was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (HR10/30, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) using 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 as the mobile phase. Fractions were analyzed for Fet3p by monitoring oxidation of p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (pPD). Briefly, 20 μl of 1.5-ml fractions were added to 200 μl of 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.05% pPD in a 96-well microtiter plate. The increase in absorbance was monitored at 570 nm using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Fractions containing pPD activity were pooled and concentrated and then applied to a fast protein liquid chromatography ion exchange Mono Q column (HR 5/5, Pharmacia) equilibrated with 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Fractions were eluted using a salt gradient from 50 mm to 500 mm, with holding steps at 100 mm NaCl and 200 mm NaCl. Fet3p eluted during the 200 mm NaCl holding step. Again, pPD oxidation was used to identify Fet3p-containing fractions that were pooled, concentrated (Amicon Centriprep 30), and applied to a HiTrap affinity column (Pharmacia) charged with CuSO4 according to the manufacturer's instructions and equilibrated with 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. Fractions were eluted using the same buffer at pH 3.5 and immediately neutralized with 10 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Fet3p-containing fractions were desalted using a Sephadex G-25 column (Pharmacia) and used for further assays. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic microassay (Pierce). For enzyme inhibition studies EDTA was obtained from Sigma, and bathocuproinedisulfonic acid was obtained from Aldrich. Amino acid analysis was performed to quantify Fet3p levels after hydrolysis of samples in 5.7 m HCl at 110 °C in vacuo for 24 h on a Beckman model 6300 analyzer. Atomic absorption analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer model 305A instrument. SDS-PAGE was performed using 4–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad). Deglycosylation was carried out by incubating samples in endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Western blot analysis, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Gelman Instrument Co.) using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot cell transfer apparatus. Fet3p was detected using an antibody generated to a predicted peptide sequence at the C-terminal end of Fet3p as described previously (9De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All oxidase assays were performed in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0. As an assay of ferroxidase activity Ferrozine, a ferrous specific chelator, was employed. Fet3p-catalyzed Fe(II) oxidation was monitored as follows: 0.2-ml reaction mixtures containing purified Fet3p were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates at room temperature. Reactions were started by the addition of ferrous ammonium sulfate at specified concentrations and quenched at 2-min intervals by the addition of 50 μl of 15 mm Ferrozine. Fe(II) remaining in solution was determined using the molar absorption constant ε570 nm = 27.9 mm−1. p-Phenylenediamine oxidation was assayed in 0.2-ml reaction volumes, and oxidation of pPD was monitored by following an increase in absorbance at 570 nm as described above. Detection of Fet3p oxidase activity in nonreducing polyacrylamide gels was performed as described previously (10Yuan D. Stearman A. Dancis A. Dunn T. Beeler T. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2632-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Partially loaded Fet3p was obtained as described above without supplementing the lysis buffer with copper, and 2 μg of purified protein was incubated with 50 μm CuSO4 in the presence or absence of 1 mm sodium ascorbate in a 20-μl volume at room temperature for 10 min. Samples were denatured in 1% SDS and loaded onto a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad), and renatured gels were incubated for 1 h in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.05% pPD. No azide was included in the buffer. Yeast cells grown to saturation in iron-limited medium (YPD-bathophenanthrolinedisulfonate (5Lesuisse E. Casteras-Simon M. Labbe P. J. Biol.

It was important to keep protease inhibitors present in all buffers and to carry out purification steps at 4 °C as rapidly as possible. Membrane fractions were obtained by high speed centrifugation, and Fet3p was solubilized using 1% Triton X-100. Fractions containing Fet3p were followed by assaying for pPD oxidase activity as described under “Materials and Methods.” The steps involved in the purification of Fet3p from S. cerevisiae are summarized in Table I. Quantification of total units of Fet3p activity in crude homogenates is relatively imprecise due to difficulties in detecting activity in this fraction. We estimate, however, that the enzyme was purified approximately 15,000-fold relative to the crude extract with a recovery of approximately 9.0%. The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by silver staining (Fig.1 A). It was important that samples denatured in SDS were not heated above 55 °C. Boiling resulted in aggregation of Fet3p, which prevented the protein from entering polyacrylamide gels. Gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed two closely spaced bands with molecular masses of approximately 100 and 120 kDa. Western analysis using an antibody generated to a predicted peptide sequence at the C-terminal of Fet3p showed that both bands represented Fet3p (Fig. 1 B). Treatment of the sample with endoglycosidase H reduced both bands to one band with a molecular mass of approximately 85 kDa, indicating that these bands represented differentially glycosylated Fet3p (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of Fet3p activity in detergent-solubilized membrane extracts (by either molecular sieve chromatography or glycerol gradients (not shown)) indicated that Fet3p eluted at a molecular mass between 100 and 150 kDa. This is similar to the molecular mass observed by SDS-PAGE and is consistent with the size of the predicted glycosylated protein indicating that (at least in the presence of detergent) Fet3p is a monomer and is not tightly associated with any other proteins.Table IPurification of Fet3pVolumeTotal proteinTotal activity1-aOne unit of activity is defined as the amount of oxidase required to produce a Δ A570 nm of 1.0/h when p-phenylenediamine is used as a substrate.Specific activityPurificationmlmgunitsunits/mg-foldYeast extract204513,7021661-bUnderestimated due to low detection in crude homogenates.0.0121-bUnderestimated due to low detection in crude homogenates.1Cytosol200011,000ND1-cND, not detected.NDMembrane fraction754134090.9982.5Solubilized membrane652413861.6133Superdex 20052.524.61857.4617Mono Q4.51.54832.52708Cu Hi-Trap10.2434218715,5831-a One unit of activity is defined as the amount of oxidase required to produce a Δ A570 nm of 1.0/h when p-phenylenediamine is used as a substrate.1-b Underestimated due to low detection in crude homogenates.1-c ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab The final homogeneous preparation of the enzyme lacked the characteristic blue color of type 1 copper-containing enzymes, and the absorbance spectra of the Fet3p did not exhibit the typical type 1 copper absorbance peak at 610 nm. The low concentration of our purified Fet3p preparation (1–5 μm) may explain the lack of absorbance in the 600 nm range. Typical extinction coefficients for type 1 copper centers are between 2 and 8 mm−1cm−1 (11Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The predicted copper ligands for the Fet3p mononuclear site are two histidines, a cysteine, and a leucine. Typical type 1 “blue” copper centers use methionine instead of leucine (12Ryde U. Olsson M.H.M. Pierloot K. Roos B.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 586-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the blue color of these proteins is attributed to a charge transfer between copper and cysteine, lack of methionine as a mononuclear copper ligand in Fet3p may weaken the absorption in the 600 nm range. To determine if the purified protein did contain copper, the preparation was subjected to amino acid analysis, and the copper content was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. A copper to protein ratio of 1.5 ± 0.1 copper atoms/molecule was determined. Assuming a copper:protein ratio of 4:1 as predicted by sequence analysis, this result suggests that less than 40% of the purified preparation contains holoFet3p. Loss of copper could have occurred during the purification of Fet3p or could reflect the ratio of apo- to holoproteinin vivo. In an attempt to determine whether the low copper:protein ratios reflect a mixture of apo- and holoFet3p in our preparations, an excess of copper sulfate (50 μm) was included in the initial homogenization step during purification of the protein. Addition of copper to cell homogenates resulted in a purified Fet3p preparation with increased activity and a copper:protein ratio of 3.79 ± 0.3. Incubation of partially copper-loaded purified Fet3p samples with copper sulfate and ascorbate increased the activity of the protein significantly, and this increase in Fet3p activity was not observed if ascorbate was omitted (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that holoFet3p contains four copper atoms/molecule as predicted for a multicopper oxidase and that reduced copper is easily incorporated into the purified apoprotein to generate the active enzyme without the need for any additional molecules. The oxidation of Fe(II) by Fet3p was assayed by monitoring the rate of disappearance of ferrous ammonium sulfate using the ferrous chelator Ferrozine. The reactions were carried out in 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.0 in the presence of 100 μm citric acid. The low pH of the buffer minimized the autoxidation of Fe(II), and citrate was included to prevent the formation of insoluble ferric hydroxides that could bias the rates of Fe(II) oxidation. Ferroxidase activity is not seen with ascorbate oxidase (data not shown) or heat-inactivated Fet3p. Initial kinetic experiments were done with preparations of partially loaded Fet3p isolated from cells without copper supplementation. As indicated in Fig. 2 A, Fet3p exhibited Michaelis-Menten type kinetics for the oxidation of ferrous ions. When an identical concentration of fully loaded Fet3p was used in the same assays, the apparent Km (estimated to be 2 μm) remained unchanged; however, the Vmax was increased from 1 μm/min for the partially loaded samples to 1.8 μm/min for the fully loaded samples (Fig.2 B). Fet3p is capable of oxidizing a number of organic substrates. Typically, multicopper oxidases can oxidize a variety of amines, catechols, and phenolic substrates such as phenylenediamine (13Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 37-100Google Scholar). p-Phenylenediamine oxidase-activity was used as an assay for Fet3p throughout our purification protocol. The apparent Km values foro-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, and epinephrine are indicated in Table II. The rate of Fet3p-catalyzed epinephrine oxidation was extremely slow, and we were unable to detect any Fet3p-dependent dopamine oxidation. It has been suggested that the ability of ceruloplasmin to catalyze the oxidation of amines reflects contamination of preparations with adventitious transition metals (14Lovstad R.A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1979; 10: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The lack of adventitious metal contamination of the Fet3p preparation may explain the lack of oxidation of these substrates. In comparison with other compounds tested, it is clear that Fe(II) is by far the best substrate for Fet3p.Table IISubstrate specificity and kinetics of Fet3p oxidase activitySubstrateApparent KmFe(II)2 μmp-Phenylenediamine2-aAbsorbance increase monitored at 570 nm.900 μmo-Phenylenediamine2-bAbsorbance increase monitored at 490 nm.4.15 mmEpinephrine2-bAbsorbance increase monitored at 490 nm.5.8 mm2-a Absorbance increase monitored at 570 nm.2-b Absorbance increase monitored at 490 nm. Open table in a new tab Azide has been shown to inhibit the activity of multicopper oxidases. This inhibition has been attributed to interference with the catalytic copper sites of these enzymes, specifically inhibition of type 1 or mononuclear copper sites (14Lovstad R.A. Gen. Pharmacol. 1979; 10: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The ferroxidase activity of Fet3p was inhibited 75–80% by the addition of 1 mm azide to the assay buffer (Fig.3 A), and complete inhibition of enzyme activity was observed with 10 mm azide (TableIII).Table IIIInhibitors of Fet3p oxidase activityConditionRate3-aAssayed using p-phenylenediamine as substrate and monitoring Δ A570 nm.Percent activitymA min−1Fet3p only4.10 ± 0.45100Fet3p + 1 mm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid2.59 ± 0.2363Fet3p + 1 mm EDTA1.72 ± 0.1842Fet3p + 10 mm azide0.37 ± 0.21<9Heat-inactivated Fet3p003-a Assayed using p-phenylenediamine as substrate and monitoring Δ A570 nm. Open table in a new tab The addition of either 1 mm EDTA or 1 mmbathocuproinedisulfonic acid (a copper chelator) inhibited the Fet3p-catalyzed oxidation of pPD by 60% and 40%, respectively (TableIII). This was not a result of the chelation of adventitious metal, since heat inactivation of the enzyme preparation abolished all oxidase activity. We conclude that the loss of a labile, catalytically active copper by chelation may be responsible for the loss of activity. Fet3p exhibited maximum ferroxidase activity at pH 5.0, which is similar to the typical growth environment of yeast (pH 4.5–5.0). Although the autoxidation of ferrous iron is higher at alkaline pH, the enzyme-catalyzed rate is easily distinguished (Fig. 3 B). An important function of ceruloplasmin in vivo is the incorporation of Fe(II) into apotransferrin, an activity dependent on the ferroxidase activity of the protein. The interaction betweenFET3 and FTR1 in S. cerevisiae suggests that the ferroxidase activity of Fet3p may be required to load iron onto Ftr1p. We examined the ability of Fet3p to catalyze the incorporation of Fe(II) onto apotransferrin. This experiment was performed to determine if ferroxidase-dependent iron loading required a specific interaction between the ferroxidase and acceptor. The data in Fig. 4 indicate that Fet3p is capable of iron loading transferrin in a specific concentration-dependent manner, albeit at a much slower rate than ceruloplasmin, (7–10 μm Fe3+transferrin/min/mm enzyme versus 550 μm Fe3+ transferrin/min/mmceruloplasmin (15Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The amount of Fe(III)-transferrin formed was calculated using the molar absorption constant of ε460 nm = 2500 m−1cm−1/Fe(III)-transferrin formed (15Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inclusion of ascorbate in the transferrin-loading assay did not interfere with the enzymatic rate of Fe(III)-transferrin formation by Fet3p. The essential components of the S. cerevisiae high affinity iron transport system consist of the products of theFET3 and FTR1 genes (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). It was hypothesized that the protein products of these genes function as a ferroxidase and a membrane transporter, respectively. Evidence that suggested that Fet3p is a ferroxidase included its homology to the multicopper oxidase family (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), a copper requirement for high affinity iron transport (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar,15Osaki S. Johnson D.A. Frieden E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2746-2751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the demonstration that a functioning Fet3p confers iron-dependent oxygen consumption in yeast (9De Silva D.M. Askwith C.C. Eide D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1098-1101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The present study confirms the identity of Fet3p as a ferroxidase; Fet3p purified to apparent homogeneity contained copper and demonstrated ferroxidase activity in vitro. Two discrete differentially glycosylated forms of Fet3p were identified in our purified enzyme preparation. These two bands can also be detected in whole cell preparations analyzed by SDS-PAGE. This observation suggests that the two forms seen in our purified preparation were not generated during the isolation process. Examination of the copper content of purified Fet3p indicates that, assuming a 4:1 stoichiometry between copper and protein, under normal conditions only about 40% of the protein is in the holoform. While loss of copper could have occurred during the isolation procedure, there is another alternative, which is that the apoform represents an intermediate in the biosynthesis of Fet3p. Fet3p could be easily reconstituted by the addition of reduced copper to the purified preparation to yield a fully active protein. Therefore, copper incorporation into Fet3p probably does not require the participation of any other molecules except reduced copper. The facile addition and removal of copper from Fet3p is in contrast to other multicopper oxidases such as ceruloplasmin where copper removal and reconstitution require stringent conditions (16Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Differential glycosylation of Fet3p may reflect localization of this protein in different parts of the secretory pathway. The addition of copper to apoFet3p is thought to occur in a Golgi or post-Golgi compartment (17Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith D. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Unless Ftr1p is present, apoFet3p is thought to be retained within this intracellular compartment (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with a significant amount of apoFet3p being retained in a subcellular compartment and may account for the low copper content of purified Fet3p isolated without copper supplementation. It is possible, therefore, that high affinity iron transport is limited by the amount of Ftr1p available to form a complex with Fet3p. Two observations support this hypothesis. First, whileFET3 mRNA concentration increases with the severity of iron limitation, iron transport per se reaches a maximum and does not increase further (6Askwith C. Eide D. Van Ho A. Bernard P.S. Li L. Davis-Kaplan S. Sipe D.M. Kaplan J. Cell. 1994; 76: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Second, we observed that galactose-dependent expression of FET3 andFTRI will result in an increase in high affinity iron transport independent of iron availability. Higher levels of transport were observed if endogenous FTR1 and galactose-drivenFTR1 expression were combined, suggesting that iron transport is limited by Ftr1p availability (3Askwith C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 401-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Among the multicopper oxidases, Fet3p and ceruloplasmin have so far proved unique in possessing the ability to catalyze the oxidation of ferrous to ferric. Although the oxidation of ferrous iron occurs spontaneously in solution, the involvement of a multicopper oxidase in the enzymatic conversion of Fe(II) to Fe(III) is important because it prevents the formation of toxic reactive oxygen intermediates. InS. cerevisiae, functional Fet3p is localized to the plasma membrane with the copper domain on the extracellular surface. In mammals, ceruloplasmin catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous iron and incorporation onto apotransferrin in plasma. Analysis of the phenotype of aceruloplasminemic individuals indicates that ceruloplasmin is involved in removal of iron from cells. Given the same enzymatic activity in an extracellular domain, what are the factors that determine vectoral transport? Clearly, the direction of iron uptake results from differences in the acceptor molecule, Ftr1p or transferrin. Two models for the interaction of the multicopper oxidase and the iron acceptor can be proposed. In the first model the specificity of transport is defined by the physical interaction of the ferroxidase and the acceptor. For example, the substrate for the ferroxidase is not iron per se, but Ftr1p-Fe(II). In this scenario the multicopper oxidase oxidizes either the protein or the protein-bound substrate. In an alternative model the ferroxidase may oxidize iron independent of the acceptor; the specificity of the interaction is determined simply by the stochastic availability of the acceptor. Previous studies have demonstrated that ceruloplasmin can exhibit ferroxidase activity in the absence of a specific acceptor (13Ryden L. Conti R. Copper Proteins and Copper Enzymes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1981: 37-100Google Scholar). Our studies on Fet3p extend that observation by showing that highly purified Fet3p also has ferroxidase activity in the absence of a specific acceptor. Thus, the inherent ferroxidase activity of the enzyme may allow the delivery of iron to a variety of ferric acceptors. As demonstrated here, Fet3p is capable of iron loading apotransferrinin vitro. In an analogous experiment, ceruloplasmin was able to catalyze the incorporation of iron into ferritin in vitro(18De Silva D.M. Miler D.M. Reif D.W. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Boyer R.F. Schori B.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Of interest is that an essential REGLE domain inFTR1, the permease partner of FET3 in S. cerevisiae, is similar to a conserved domain, REGAE, in the ferritin light chain that is essential for iron nucleation and core formation (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between Fet3p and the yeast permease need not be strong, but merely the proximity of the two proteins within the membrane may allow effective transfer of ferric iron between the two. It may be hypothesized that the interaction between ferroxidase and ferric acceptor may be a general physiological mechanism for translocation or storage of iron. On the basis of genetic experiments, Stearman et al. (2Stearman R. Yuan D.S. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Klausner R.D. Dancis A. Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) concluded that a complex between Fet3p and Ftr1p is required for delivery of both molecules to the cell surface. Nevertheless, attempts to demonstrate a physical complex between these two cell surface molecules have not been fruitful. For example, Fet3p behaves as a monomer when analyzed by either molecular sieve chromatography or velocity sedimentation. We recognize that the caveat to this conclusion is that these analytical approaches involve the use of detergent, and perhaps even mild detergents destabilize the complex. Attempts to cross-link the two proteins in situ, while not exhaustive, have also been unfruitful. Our results suggest that a stable high affinity complex between cell surface Fet3p and Ftr1 may not be necessary for iron transport. That is, the transfer of Fe(III) from Fet3p to Ftr1p may occur simply by diffusion-mediated collision between Fet3p and Ftr1p. Examination of the literature has not provided any evidence for a complex between transferrin and ceruloplasmin. In conclusion, purification and analysis of the yeast Fet3 protein demonstrates that this membrane-bound protein required for high affinity iron acquisition in S. cerevisiae is a ferro-O2-oxidoreductase. The functional homology between Fet3p and ceruloplasmin suggest that these two proteins comprise a unique subset of multicopper oxidases that possess essential ferroxidase activity required for maintenance of iron homeostasisin vivo."

This complexity reflects the adaptation of cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases to diverse functions in parasitic protozoa. Cathepsin L is a mammalian member of the papain superfamily, which comprises the largest family of cysteine proteinases identified to date (1Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Cathepsin L is generally a lysosomal protein involved in protein degradation (2Kirschke H. Barrett A.J. Glaumann H. Ballard F.J. Lysosomes: Their Role in Protein Breakdown.Academic Press. 1987; : 193-238Google Scholar), although secreted enzyme has been implicated in a number of physiological processes including bone resorption (3Kategawa H.

The protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is processed (by removal of the NH2-terminal pro-peptide extension in the pre-lysosomal compartment) to produce a single chain mature enzyme. The pro-region is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme's activity (6Carmona C. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Ménard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) through its binding to the active site (7Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M.

Cathepsin L-like enzymes have been characterized from a wide range of eukaryotes, including some protists that are thought to form the earliest branches of the eukaryotic tree (1Berti P.J.

There are many cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases in parasitic protozoa; frequently they are highly abundant and stage-regulated, and in some instances they occur in unusual cellular locations, such as on the surface, or are secreted (9McKerrow J.H.

Trypanosomatid flagellated protozoa of the genus Leishmania are responsible for a number of human diseases in the tropics and subtropics (14Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The diseases, the leishmaniases, range in severity from a visceral infection that is frequently fatal unless treated to a cutaneous lesion that self-cures. The parasite has two principal morphological forms: a motile extracellular flagellated form, the promastigote, which resides in the sandfly vector; and a nonmotile form, the amastigote, which resides in a phagolysosomal vacuole in a mammalian macrophage. Two distinct developmental types of promastigote live in the sandfly: the multiplicative promastigote in the mid-gut, and the nondividing metacyclic promastigote in the mouthparts. The metacyclic promastigote is infective to mammals and has distinct biochemical properties that distinguish it from the multiplicative promastigote. The major cysteine proteinase activities detected in Leishmania mexicana are cathepsin L-like in their substrate specificity (15Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem.

Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and have been classified as belonging to the papain superfamily (1Berti P.J. Storer A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). They show in general a marked stage-regulated expression with there being a very low level of mRNA detected in multiplicative promastigotes, higher levels in metacyclic promastigotes, and very high mRNA levels in amastigotes (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The encoded cysteine proteinases similarly show stage regulation in that most of the multiple enzymes are at the highest activity in amastigotes (15Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). There are, however, two CPB activities that appear to be predominantly expressed in metacyclic promastigotes (18Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 127-132Crossref Google Scholar). The amastigote's CPB activity has been categorized into four groups (A, B, C, and E) on the basis of their physical characteristics and substrate preferences (15Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Group A cysteine proteinases are glycosylated, as assessed by their ability to bind concanavalin A, whereas groups B and C do not bind this lectin. Groups B and C enzymes differ in their elution from anion exchange resin (reflecting charge differences) and have different substrate preferences; group C enzymes are less efficient at cleaving substrates with a bulky amino acid in the substrate P1 position (15Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Group E enzymes differ from the other amastigote cysteine proteinases in having slower mobilities in gelatin-SDS-polyacrylamide gels and apparently being membrane-associated (16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal sequence analysis confirmed that cysteine proteinases of groups A, B, and C are encoded by cpb genes, leading to the hypothesis that different copies of the repeat encode cysteine proteinase isoenzymes with distinct characteristics (16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cpb genes, together with homologs from otherLeishmania species (19Traub-Cseko Y.M. Duboise M. Boukai L.K.

Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis: Biology and Control.CAB International. 1997; : 177-197Google Scholar). Type I cysteine proteinases are cathepsin L-like in the mature domain but are characterized by the presence of an unusual, long COOH-terminal extension (CTE). CTEs have also been found on cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinases of rice and other plants, although they have no sequence homology with the CTEs of the trypanosomatid enzymes (25Watanabe H. Abe K. Emori Y. Hosoyama H. Arai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16897-16902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koizumi M. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Tsuji H. Shinozaki K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1993; 129: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); none has been observed with vertebrates' cysteine proteinases. The two copies of cpb which have been described previously encode a 100-amino acid CTE, some residues of which are apparently processed in the production of the mature enzyme (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The function of the CTE is unknown, although several roles have been postulated, including trafficking of the enzyme to the lysosome, modulating the substrate specificity of the enzyme, inhibiting the activity of the enzyme until correctly processed and targeted, and diverting the host's immune system (12Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis: Biology and Control.CAB International. 1997; : 177-197Google Scholar). We have described the generation, by targeted gene disruption, ofL. mexicana mutants null for the cpb gene array, which showed that the CPBs are virulence factors (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Null mutants are less able than wild type L. mexicana to survive in macrophages in vitro and to infect mice. Re-expression of one internal copy of the tandem array in the null mutant gave an active cysteine proteinase that restored the in vitro virulence phenotype (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This approach of expressing individual copies of thecpb gene array in the null mutant provides a powerful method for determining the activity of, and functional differences between, individual isoenzymes and so allows analysis of the relationship between structure and function. We have now cloned and sequenced three more cpb genes from the array, re-expressed them individually in the null mutant, and investigated their substrate specificities and their ability to restore the virulence phenotype. L. mexicana (MNYC/BZ/62/M379) promastigotes were grown in HOMEM medium with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, pH 7.5, at 25 °C as described elsewhere (28Mottram J.C. Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Mid-log phase (multiplicative) promastigotes were harvested from cultures at a density of 5 × 106 ml−1 and stationary phase (metacyclic) promastigotes at a density of approximately 2 × 107ml−1, as described previously (29Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J.M. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amastigotes were isolated from infected BALB/c mice (30Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Amastigote-like forms (axenic amastigotes) were grown in vitro in Schneider'sDrosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum at pH 5.5 and 32 °C (31Bates P.A. Robertson C.D. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Antibiotics appropriate for the selection of transfectants were added as follows: hygromycin B (Sigma) at 50 μg ml−1; phleomycin (Cayla, France) at 10 μg ml−1; neomycin (G418, Geneticin, Life Technologies Inc.) at 25 μg ml−1. The infectivity of parasites to peritoneal exudate cells was determined as described previously (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). 15–23-kb fragments of L. mexicana DNA partially digested with Sau3AI were purified on a 1–3m NaCl gradient and ligated into λ Dash II (Stratagene). A library of 3 × 105 independent clones was generated. The library was screened with 32P-labeledcpb cDNA clone pSWB1a (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and positive clones isolated by plaque purification according to standard methods (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). λ DNA was isolated using Wizard bacteriophage minipreparations (Promega). λ clones were mapped using restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization with probes able to distinguish the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences.cpb genes were subcloned into pBluescript SKII plasmid (pBS) for sequence analysis. A 2.8-kb Sal I fragment from λ13, containing cpb1 (the first gene of the array), was cloned into the Sal I site of pBS(SK−) to give plasmid clone pNE2. A 2.8-kb Sal I fragment from λ20, containingcpb18 (the penultimate gene in the array), was cloned into the Sal I site of pBS(SK−) to give plasmid pNX2. A 3.0-kb Sal I fragment from λ20, containing cpb19(the last gene of the array), was cloned into the Sal I site of pBS(SK−) to give plasmid pNX3. The nucleotide sequence covering thecpb open reading frame for each gene was determined in both orientations using a series of overlapping oligonucleotide primers about 300 bp apart. Sequencing was carried out on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer), and analysis was performed using the Wisconsin GCG package. cpb genes were cloned directionally into the pTEX vector (33Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). cpb1 was subcloned on aEco RI/Hin dIII fragment from pNE2 into theEco RI/Hin dIII of pTEX to give pTEXNE2,cpb18 on a Eco RI/Hin dIII fragment from pNX2 into the Eco RI/Hin dIII of pTEX to give pTEXNX2, and cpb19 on an Hin dIII/Xho I fragment from NX3 into the Hin dIII/Xho I site of pTEX to give pTEXNX3. The cloning of pTEXG2.8 and pTEXSWB1a has been described (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Transfection of L. mexicana has been described previously (27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J.

Parasitol. 1994; 63: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Wild type L. mexicana DNA was isolated using a Nucleon kit (Scotlab, Coatbridge). RNA was isolated from different life cycle stages ofL. mexicana (mid-log phase promastigotes, stationary phase promastigotes, and amastigotes) using a Qiagen total RNA kit. Southern and Northern blots were carried out as described previously (28Mottram J.C. Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 223-bp DNA probes corresponding to sequence in the CTE ofcpb2.8 and the equivalent position in cpb1 were generated by PCR using, respectively, primers DB1 and DB2 (on plasmid template pNE2) and primers DB3 and DB4 (on plasmid template pTEXG2.8; Ref 27Mottram J.C.

A 1.4-kb Eco RI/Xho I fragment from plasmid pSWB1a was used as a cpb cDNA probe (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). DB1: ACTGATATGTACTGCACTCAG DB2: TATAGGGAGGTGGTCTTCCTC DB3: TTCGATAAGAACTGCACTCAG DB4: TAGTGACAGGTGTTCATGATC DNA fragments were labeled by random priming (Stratagene) and hybridized as described (29Mottram J.C.

FIGE was carried out at 10 °C using a Hoefer Switchback Pulse Controller. 2.5 μg ofL. mexicana wild type genomic DNA was digested to completion with Xho I and run at 150 volts (at 5.2 V/cm) on a 0.9% GTG agarose gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The run-in time was 10 min, run time was 28 h, pulse time was 0.6 to 2.0 s in reverse mode with a F/R ratio of 3:1. The gel was blotted onto Hybond N (Amersham Corp.) and probed with a 1.4-kb Eco RI/Xho I fragment from cpb cDNA clone pSWB1a as described (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Proteinase activity was analyzed using substrate-SDS-PAGE. Gelatin-SDS-PAGE involved electrophoresis under reducing conditions on 12% (w/v) acrylamide gels incorporating 0.2% gelatin and staining with Coomassie Blue R-250 to detect hydrolysis of gelatin as described (15Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Substrate specificity of the proteinases was also assessed following separation on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (12% w/v acrylamide) gels by incubation with 10 μm peptidyl amidomethylcoumarin fluorogenic substrates (BzFVR-NHMec and SucLY-NHMec, from Sigma) as described previously (18Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 127-132Crossref Google Scholar). Western blotting with anti-CPB antiserum (16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was performed as described (28Mottram J.C. Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Barry J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1925-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Axenic amastigotes were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 20 °C and the pellet fixed in freshly prepared 2% (w/v)p-formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 30 min. Pellets were washed twice for 5 min in cold phosphate-buffered saline and cold processed (modified from Ref. 35Bannister L.H. Kent A.P. Hyde J.E. Molecular Parasitology Protocols.Hamana Press. 1992; : 415-429Google Scholar) through an increasing series of alcohol concentrations: 50% ethanol, 4 °C for 10 min; then 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol steps at −20 °C for 20 min each, with agitation at 10 min. The samples were subsequently treated with a 50:50 mixture of LR White Medium resin and absolute ethanol at −20 °C for 30 min, then with a 75:25 resin/ethanol mixture at −20 °C for 30 min, then with 100% resin for 8 h (during which time the specimens were brought up to 20 °C) and subsequently allowed to infiltrate fully overnight with mild agitation. Parasite pellets were transferred to gelatin capsules in fresh LR White Medium resin and polymerized at 20 °C under 365-nm indirect UV light for 2 days. Ultrathin sections were collected onto 300 mesh nickel grids. On-grid immunostaining was performed essentially as described previously (36Griffiths G. Fine Structure Immunocytochemistry.Springer-Verlag Heidelburg. 1993; Google Scholar). Blocking and conditioning steps using 0.2m glycine and 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min each were followed by incubation for 30 min in anti-CPB antibody diluted 200-fold in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% acetylated bovine serum albumin (Aurion) and then a 30-min incubation in goat anti-rabbit antibody, 10 nm of gold conjugate (Aurion) diluted 20-fold in the same buffer. Sections were briefly counterstained in 0.5% uranyl acetate and viewed with a Zeiss 902 EFTEM at 0 eV to improve contrast. Proteinases encoded by the cpb gene array are polymorphic (16Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but it was not known whether this is because of differences in gene sequence between copies of the array or because of post-translational modifications, or a combination of both. We have characterized in detail thecpb locus (Fig. 1 A) using genomic mapping, FIGE (Fig. 1 B), analysis of λ clones containing sections of the array, and sequence analysis. Southern blot analysis of genomic Xho I fragments from wild type L. mexicana DNA separated by FIGE and probed with a cpb-specific probe revealed three hybridizing fragments of 47, 4.0, and 2.8 kb (Fig.1 B). Xho I sites are located in the unique 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of the array and also just downstream of thecpb open reading frame for the first two copies of the array, but they are not present in any other of the cpb repeat units (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The 4.0-kbXho I fragment contains cpb1, the first copy of the array, the 2.8-kb fragment the second copy, cpb2, and the 47-kb fragment the remaining copies. As all the copies occur on 2.8-kb Sal I fragments (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and taking into account the position of the Xho I site downstream of the last copy of the array (Fig. 1 A), it was calculated that there are 17 gene copies present on the 47-kb Xho I fragment and hence a total of 19 copies in the whole array. The single band at 47 kb indicates that the two allelic arrays contain the same number of copies ofcpb. This is in contrast to the type I cysteine proteinase genes of the X10.6 strain of T. cruzi which have 14 and 23 copies in allelic clusters (37Tomás A.M. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A library was constructed in λ by partial digestion of L. mexicana genomic DNA with Sau3AI. The library was screened with the cpb cDNA, and several λ clones were isolated. Southern blot analysis of λ clones digested with diagnostic restriction enzymes and hybridized with 5′ and 3′ cpb cDNA probes identified fragments that contained either unique 5′- or 3′-flanking sequence with varying amounts of the cpb repeat (Fig. 1 A) and λ clones that containedcpb repeat units only. λ14 was found to contain the complete cpb1 gene and part of cpb2, whereas λ13 contained cpb1, cpb2, and cpb3. λ20 contained the last two copies in the array (cpb18 andcpb19) and the 3′-flanking sequence. Several of thecpb genes were subcloned into pBluescript for sequence analysis. cpb1 was cloned on a 2.8-kb Sal I fragment from λ14 (to give pNE2), cpb18 on a 2.8-kbSal I fragment from λ20 (to give pNX2), andcpb19 on a 3.0-kb Sal I fragment from λ20 (to give pNX3). The sequences of the cpb cDNA and internal gene cpb2.8 have been reported previously (17Souza A.E. Waugh S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The nucleic acid sequence of the 2.1-kb Hin dIII/Xho I fragment containing cpb1 is shown in Fig.2 A. The first 453 bp do not occur within the intergenic sequence of the cpb array; and a probe specific to this region, generated by PCR with primers to the sequences indicated (underlined in Fig. 2 A), recognized a single band in Southern blots (Ref. 27Mottram J.C.

No receptor desensitization was observed in an m2 mAChR with residues Thr307–Ser311 mutated to alanine residues. In contrast, mutation of the other Ser/Thr cluster, residues Ser286–Ser290, to alanines produced a receptor that continued to desensitize. Internalization of the m2 mAChR was promoted by phosphorylation of either cluster, suggesting that distinct mechanisms with unique structural requirements act downstream of m2 mAChR phosphorylation to mediate receptor desensitization and receptor internalization.

Phosphorylation of the activated receptor is a critical event leading to receptor desensitization. The kinase(s) that phosphorylate the agonist-occupied m2 mAChR include one or more members of a family of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P.

Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR by GRKs enables the m2 mAChR to bind arrestin proteins (6Gurevich V.V. Richardson R.M. Kim C.M. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16879-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which “arrest” or “desensitize” GPR signaling by uncoupling the receptors from their G-proteins (7Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L.

A second event that may contribute to desensitization is the rapid and reversible internalization of the m2 mAChR away from the plasma membrane during the first minutes of agonist exposure (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 4Tsuga H. Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H.

Kameyama K. Haga T. Kurose H. Nagao T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32522-32527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and studies with the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) have suggested a role of arrestin-receptor interaction in internalization (10Ferguson S.S.G. Downey W.E. Colapietro A.-M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). However, internalization is not sufficient for m2 mAChR desensitization, and the processes mediating receptor/G-protein uncoupling and internalization can be dissociated (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that while receptor phosphorylation contributes to both uncoupling and internalization of the m2 mAChR, different mechanisms may be involved in the two regulatory events. We have constructed a series of substitution mutants of the m2 mAChR to identify the in vivo sites of agonist-dependent phosphorylation and to investigate the contributions of the phosphorylated sites to m2 mAChR desensitization and m2 mAChR internalization. Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR occurs at a stoichiometry of 3–5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor in intact cells (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P.

This region contains two separate clusters of five amino acids with four Ser/Thr residues each; these Ser/Thr-rich clusters are both homologous to the cluster of residues in the α2A-AR shown to undergo agonist-dependent phosphorylation (13Eason M.G. Moreira S.P. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4681-4688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The amino acids 282–323 region also contains seven other Ser/Thr residues not located in these two clusters. In this study we mutated the Ser/Thr residues in the 282–323 region, including those in the two clusters, to alanines and investigated the effects of the mutations on agonist-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization of the m2 mAChR. m2 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor G-protein-coupled receptor G-protein coupled receptor kinase third intracellular loop adrenergic receptor N-methyl scopolamine quinuclidinyl benzilate human embryonic kidney wild type Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. 32Pi and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) were from Amersham Corp. 3H-Labeled N-methyl scopolamine ([3H]NMS) was purchased from DuPont NEN.

The mutant STSVS → AAAVA (amino acids 286–290), which we termed the NAla4 mutant (Fig. 1), was described previously (15Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol.

Mutant TVSTS → AVAAA (amino acids 307–311), termed CAla4, was constructed from the wild type human m2 mAChR using megaprimer PCR mutagenesis. The first-round primers were primer KT3(5′-CGGGATCCAGGCCTATTATGTTTCAGGTTCAGGAGGAGGTGTCCTTGTAGCGCCTATG-3′ and the mutagenic primer Csense(5′-CAGGATGAAACGCAGTTGCCGCTGCCCTGGGCC-3′) using pCR3-m2KT3 as a template. The second round reaction used primer m2–385/407(5′-GAATTCGTGTGACCTTTGGCTAGCCCTGG-3′) with the first round reaction product and pCR3-m2KT3 as a template. Mutant N,CAla8, containing both the NAla4 and CAla4 mutations, was constructed by four-primer PCR mutagenesis. The first round reactions used primers KT3 and Csense or primersm2–385/407 and Cantisense (the exact compliment of Csense) with pCR3-m2KT3 NAla4 as a template. The second round reaction combined the first round products with primers KT3 and m2–385/407. All first round reactions were performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene); all second round reactions used Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The second round reaction products were cut withNhe I and Xma I and subcloned into pCR3-m2KT3. All four receptors (wild type (WT), NAla4, CAla4, and N,CAla8) were epitope-tagged with a His6tag on the C termini, replacing the modified KT3 tag (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Vector pCR3-m2KT3 was used as a template for a PCR reaction using primers m2–385/407 and m2his6(5′-AACTGCAGCTACCTGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTGTAGCGCCTATGTTC-3′). This product was cut with Nhe I and Pst I and subcloned into this site in pCR3-m2KT3 to make pCR3-m2His6. AXma I-Pst I fragment was excised from pCR3-m2His6 and ligated into the same site in each of the three mutant receptors to create His6-tagged versions of each of these receptors. Single and double point mutations of the remaining Ser/Thr residues were constructed by the same four-primer PCR mutagenesis method. All sequences were confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing. All mutant receptors were expressed at similar levels in transient or stable transfection systems (see below) and were analyzed in radioligand binding assays to compare their abilities to bind agonist and antagonist. All mutants used here exhibited similar agonist and antagonist binding properties as the WT m2 mAChR. Cell culture and transfections in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were performed as described (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using a clone of HEK293 cells stably expressing SV40 large T antigen, HEK-tsA201 (16Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar), to increase expression levels. Transiently transfected cells expressing WT or mutant receptors yielded 1.5–3.0 pmol of m2 mAChR/mg of total cell protein. Stable cell lines were made by transfecting HEK293 cells with the pCR3-m2 mutant plasmids. G418-resistant clones were selected and analyzed for antagonist binding to determine receptor expression levels. The stable cell lines used in this study stably expressed the following amounts of m2 mAChR, as assessed by [3H]QNB binding assays: WT, 1.0 pmol/mg of protein; NAla4, 0.8 pmol/mg of protein; CAla4, 0.9 pmol/mg of protein; N,CAla8, 1.1 pmol/mg of protein. In this study, we used the following strategies to study the heterologously expressed m2 mAChR. Transient transfections were used to initially characterize mutant m2 mAChRs for their ability to become phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner. Use of transiently expressed receptors allowed a rapid screening of mutant receptors in phosphorylation assays. However, for technical reasons, it is easier to study the m2 mAChR adenylyl cyclase coupling in stable cell lines (e.g. to measure coupling to adenylyl cyclase in the transiently transfected cells requires co-transfection of a stimulatory receptor). Thus, once interesting mutants were identified in the phosphorylation studies, we produced stable cell lines expressing these mutants to use for signaling studies. We had previously established that the stoichiometry for agonist-dependent phosphorylation occurred to 3–5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor in both transient transfections and stable HEK clones and that receptor desensitization occurred equivalently in these two expression systems (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, the validity of making comparisons between effects of agonist to induce receptor phosphorylation and uncoupling in studies of transiently and stably transfected cell lines has been shown experimentally (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast, m2 mAChR internalization occurred at different rates and to different extents in the two expression systems. Thus, both stable clonal lines and transient transfections were used to assay mutant m2 mAChR internalization in this study. Transiently transfected HEK-tsA201 cells were labeled for 4 h with 0.25 mCi/ml 32Pi in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with or without drugs for 15 min at room temperature and homogenized in 20 mm NaPO4, 20 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, plus protease inhibitors (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting crude particulate fraction was then solubilized in homogenization buffer plus 0.4% digitonin and 0.08% cholate, and the solubilized proteins were separated from the insoluble fraction by centrifuging the mixture at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The solubilized m2 mAChRs were immunoprecipitated by an overnight incubation with anti-m2 mAChR antibody (14Levey A.I. Edmunds S.M. Hersch S.M. Wiley R.G. Heilman C.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 351: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and protein G-agarose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed with solubilization buffer until no radioactive counts could be further washed from the pellets, and the proteins were eluted by incubating for 3 min at 95 °C in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Laemmli) (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206281) Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were separated on 8% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the receptors were analyzed by immunoblotting and phosphor imaging. Nitrocellulose filters (0.2 μm) were blocked for 30 min in Blotto (5% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline). For detection of the receptors, the anti-m2 mAChR antibody (14Levey A.I. Edmunds S.M. Hersch S.M. Wiley R.G. Heilman C.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 351: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:25,000 in Blotto and incubated with the filter for 2 h at room temperature. The filter was rinsed with TBS and incubated for 1–2 h at room temperature with sheep anti-rat IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase, diluted 1:4000 in Blotto. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used as the detection method for all immunoblotting experiments. Phosphorylation of receptors was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and phosphor imaging using a Fuji Bas2000 PhosphorImager. The amount of radioactivity in each receptor band was quantified using standards containing known amounts of radioactivity on each phosphor image. Because variable amounts of receptor protein were recovered in the immunoprecipitation, in each experiment the amount of receptor in each lane was quantified by immunoblotting the immunoprecipitates followed by analysis using a Bio-Rad scanning densitometer; by using known amounts of purified receptor, we constructed a standard curve in each analysis to convert the densitometric values to mol of protein, as described previously (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The immunoblotting was performed under conditions where the staining of the receptor standards was in the linear range. Samples outside the linear range of exposure in the ECL assay, as assessed by multiple exposures of different times, were not included in the analyses. The results of the protein and radioactive analyses were combined to determine the amounts of radioactivity/unit of protein. This allowed a rigorous comparison of the extent of phosphorylation of the WT and mutant receptors. In addition, since the stoichiometry of agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the WT m2 mAChR was previously determined by us to be 3–5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor in the HEK cell expression systems (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), this analysis allowed us to estimate the stoichiometries of phosphorylation of the mutants receptors. Cyclic AMP levels were determined using [3H]adenine-labeled whole cells as described previously (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 10 min with no drug, 10 μm isoproterenol, or 10 μmisoproterenol plus 0.1 μm to 1 mm carbachol, all in the presence of 1 mm isobutyl 1-methylxanthine. Cellular cAMP was recovered by the method of Salomon et al.(18Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Isoproterenol treatment produced a 1.5–10-fold (average 7.4 ± 1.2-fold, n = 16) increase in cAMP levels compared with basal levels. While the magnitude of the isoproterenol response varied in different experiments as indicated, no significant differences were measured within each experiment in the β-AR response or the forskolin (20 μm) response for cells expressing the different WT or mutant receptors or in cells pretreated with carbachol versus naive cells. No response to carbachol was observed in parental HEK293 cells expressing no exogenous m2 mAChR, indicating that this cell line does not express any endogenous muscarinic receptors that affect adenylyl cyclase signaling. Since the [3H]adenine whole cell labeling method does not yield an estimate of the pmol cAMP/mg protein, to compare results from experiment to experiment and to take into account the experimental variations in isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated levels of cAMP, the amounts of cellular cAMP for each experiment were normalized by setting basal levels to 0% and isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated levels to 100%. Signaling through the m2 mAChR was expressed as the percentage decrease in cAMP levels due to carbachol-induced attenuation of the isoproterenol response. The desensitization of the adenylyl cyclase response was analyzed using pairs of cells in which we compared the decrease in isoproterenol-induced cAMP levels produced by carbachol in naive cells versus cells pretreated with agonist to induce desensitization. The data were analyzed with paired t tests. Agonist-induced decreases in the number of receptors located on the cell surface were measured using whole cell radioligand binding with the hydrophilic mAChR antagonist, [3H]NMS, which cannot cross cellular membranes. Transiently or stably transfected cells were incubated for 0–120 min in the presence or absence of 1 mm carbachol, washed five times with 3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and subjected to radioligand binding with saturating concentrations of [3H]NMS for 2 h at 4 °C using methods previously described (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 10 μm atropine. Protein assays were performed to assess differences in cell density on each treated plate so that radioligand binding data could be analyzed as mol of receptor/mg of protein. The amount of receptor present on the cell surface as a function of time of exposure to carbachol was expressed as a percentage of cell surface receptor present at zero time. For internalization studies, the percentage of mutant receptor remaining on the cell surface after various times of agonist exposure was compared with levels observed for the WT m2 mAChR and analyzed by a student's t test. No loss of total receptor number was observed during the 2-h duration of agonist treatment as assessed by use of the hydrophobic radioligand [3H]QNB. A deletion of amino acids 282–323 in the central portion of the i3 loop of the human m2 mAChR was previously shown to completely abolish agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R.

This domain contains two Ser/Thr-rich clusters that are potential phosphorylation sites, since they are in acidic domains and analogous to the phosphorylation domain of the α2A-AR (14Levey A.I. Edmunds S.M. Hersch S.M. Wiley R.G. Heilman C.J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 351: 339-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We mutated each of these Ser/Thr clusters to alanine residues to test the hypothesis that these Ser/Thr residues are phosphorylated and contribute to the desensitization of the m2 mAChR. The Ser/Thr residues in the cluster near the N terminus of this region (N cluster, Fig. 1) were mutated to alanine in mutant m2-NAla4 (S286A, T287A, S288A, S290A), and Ser/Thr residues in the cluster near the C terminus of this region (C cluster, Fig. 1) were mutated to alanine in mutant m2-CAla4 (T307A, S309A, T310A, S311A). These mutant receptors were expressed in HEK cells, and their properties were analyzed in ligand binding assays. No significant differences were detected in their ability to bind the antagonist NMS or the agonist carbachol compared with the WT m2 mAChR (Table I). The levels of expression of the WT and mutant receptors in the HEK-tsA201 cells were also similar (see “Experimental Procedures”).Table ISummary of binding data for Ser/Thr cluster mutant m2 mAChRs expressed in HEK-tsA201 cellsReceptor typeKD of NMSIC50 of carbacholExpression levels: stable HEK clones ([3H]QNB)nmμmpmol/mg proteinWT m2 ChR0.6661.0NAla40.42140.8CAla40.3760.9N,CAla80.6581.1Whole cell binding assays were used to calculate theKD for [3H]NMS from saturation binding isotherms and the IC50 of carbachol inhibition of 0.2 nm [3H]NMS binding.

The extent of agonist-dependent phosphorylation of mutant m2 mAChRs was compared with that of the WT m2 mAChR in transiently transfected HEK tsA201 cells. Cells expressing the different forms of the m2 mAChR were labeled with 32Pi, treated with a saturating concentration (1 mm) of the agonist carbachol or vehicle for 15 min, and the receptors were isolated by immunoprecipitation. In previous studies, we demonstrated agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation in transiently transfected HEK-tsA201 cells and in stably transfected m2 mAChR-expressing HEK cell lines; in both the transient and stable expression systems the stoichiometry of agonist-dependent phosphorylation was measured as 3–5 mol of phosphate/mol of receptor (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the present experiments, stoichiometries were not determined; rather, we used the WT m2 mAChR as a standard to which we compared the levels of phosphorylation for the mutant m2 mAChRs. The transient expression system was used to quickly screen for mutations in the m2 mAChR that produced changes in agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. For each experiment, the amount of32Pi incorporated into the various receptors (assessed by phosphor imaging) was expressed as a function of the amount of receptor present in each lane (assessed by densitometric analysis of the immunoblot). Carbachol treatment of WT m2 mAChR, the m2-NAla4, and the m2-CAla4 (Fig. 2 A) resulted in an agonist-dependent phosphorylation of each receptor. The extents of phosphorylation of the m2-NAla4 and the m2-CAla4 were 97 ± 7% and 107 ± 4%, respectively, of the levels of agonist-dependent phosphorylation measured for the WT m2 mAChR (Fig. 2 C). Thus, while precise measurements of stoichiometry were not attempted, the results suggested that the WT and both mutant receptors were phosphorylated to similar extents. These results, taken with the previous results that localized the sites of phosphorylation to the domain containing amino acids 282–323 (3Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Xu Y. Witt-Enderby P. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29004-29011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggested that either 1) the sites of agonist-dependent phosphorylation were located in the remaining seven Ser/Thr residues in this domain (Fig. 1,gray residues), or 2) the two clusters of Ser/Thr residues, which are highly homologous and almost mirror images, were redundant sites for agonist-dependent phosphorylation. Pairs of the remaining Ser/Thr residues in this region were mutated to alanines to test the first possibility. Mutants S282A/S283A, S294A/S315A, and S320A/T323A all exhibited agonist-dependent phosphorylation like the m2 mAChR (data not shown). To test the second possibility we constructed a mutant receptor with both Ser/Thr clusters mutated to alanines (N,CAla8).

To investigate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, we analyzed the effect of the two cytokines on TNF-α production and TNF-α mRNA accumulation in the mouse macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and J774 stimulated by LPS. Whereas LPS-induced TNF-α production is strongly suppressed by both cytokines, TNF-α mRNA accumulation is not significantly affected, indicating that IL-4 and IL-13 induce a translational repression of TNF-α mRNA. Transfection of reporter gene constructs containing different regions of the TNF-α gene revealed that the inhibitory action of IL-4 and IL-13 is mediated by the UA-rich sequence present in the TNF-α mRNA 3′-untranslated region.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-αLPSlipopolysaccharideILinterleukinCMVcytomegalovirusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseCSBPCSAID (cytokine-suppressive antiinflammatory drug) binding protein is a pleiotropic cytokine secreted by different cell types including macrophages, mastocytes, T and B lymphocytes, and natural killer cells in response to various stimuli (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), viruses, parasites, etc.) (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar). A wide variety of cell types express TNF-α receptors, and the pleiotropism of TNF-α results from the complexity of the signal transduction pathways that are activated by its receptors. TNF-α is characterized by cytostatic and cytolytic effects on tumor cells of different origins (2Sugarman B.J. Aggrawal B.B. Figari I.S. Hass P.E. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), by antiviral properties (3Mire Sluis A.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7575-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). TNF-α has also been identified as a major mediator of inflammatory processes, one of the most dramatic being Gram-negative endotoxic shock (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar). Indeed, upon exposure to LPS or other agents simulating host invasion, macrophages produce large amounts of TNF-α that are released in the circulatory system. High levels of circulating TNF-α trigger a state of shock and tissue injury that carries an extremely high mortality rate (1Beutler B.

Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar) levels. In resting macrophages, TNF-α synthesis is low because TNF-α gene transcription is weak and TNF-α mRNA translation is severely repressed. The translational repression is mediated by the UA-rich sequence present in the TNF-α mRNA 3′-untranslated region (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar). Macrophage activation by LPS results in NF-κB-dependent activation of TNF-α gene transcription, derepression of TNF-α mRNA translation, and secretion of TNF-α protein. TNF-α production by macrophages can be down-regulated by various agents including cytokines like IL-4 and IL-13 (7Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.-M. Dumont X. Guillemont J.-C. Kaghad M. Labit C.

Both cytokines share many biological activities including the activation of B cell proliferation, IgE switching, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production (9de Vries J.E. Punnonen J.

However, the molecular mechanism of this regulation has not been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which IL-4 and IL-13 down-regulate TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated mouse RAW 264.7 and J774 macrophages. We show that in these cell types, IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production mainly at the translational level. Furthermore, down-regulation of TNF-α mRNA translation by IL-4 and IL-13 is mediated by the UA-rich sequence present in its 3′-untranslated region. LPS from Escherichia coli (strain 0.127:B8) was obtained from Sigma. [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) and [14C]chloramphenicol (56 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. Murine recombinant IL-4 and TNF-α were purchased from Genzyme. Purified murine IL-13 was obtained from Sanofi Elf Biorecherches, Labège, France. Both reporter constructs used in this study have been described elsewhere: CMV3′TNF in Ref. 13Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J.

Inflamm. 1996; 46: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar, referred to as construct 3. The murine macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7 and J774 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS Myoclone Super Plus, Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. RAW 264.7 cells were cotransfected with each of the described constructs and pSV2Neo as described (15Peppel K. Vinci J.M. Baglioni C. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Cells were first selected for 1 day with 0.3 mg/ml G418 sulfate, for 1 day with 0.6 mg/ml, and for 2 weeks with 1 mg/ml. The resistant clones were then pooled. The cells were stimulated simultaneously with LPS (10 ng/ml) and IL-4 (5 ng/ml) or IL-13 (5 ng/ml) unless otherwise specified. TNF-α levels were measured in cell supernatants by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse TNF-α antibody for coating and the same biotinylated polyclonal antibody for detection (generously provided by Dr. W. Buurman, University of Limburg Maastricht, The Netherlands). CAT assays were performed as described (17Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 12: 1044-1051Crossref Scopus (5294) Google Scholar), and quantification of CAT activity was performed with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Northern blot analysis was performed as described (16Kruys V. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using 10 and 20 μg of total cytoplasmic RNA for TNF-α and CAT mRNA detection, respectively. Blots were hybridized with antisense riboprobes for TNF-α and CAT mRNAs (16Kruys V. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 12: 1044-1051Crossref Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). For quantification, the blots were rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense riboprobe. RNA quantification was achieved by normalizing the radioactive signal corresponding to TNF-α mRNA to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the same RNA sample. RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages produce large amounts of TNF-α in response to LPS. Moreover, the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of TNF-α biosynthesis by LPS is well characterized in this cell line. Therefore, RAW 264.7 cells provided an appropriate system to analyze the mechanism by which IL-4 and IL-13 suppress LPS-induced TNF-α production. We also analyzed the mechanism by which these cytokines down-regulate LPS-induced TNF-α production in J774 cells, which produce high levels of TNF-α upon LPS stimulation. A recent study has shown that depending on the time of exposure to IL-4 or IL-13 relative to LPS stimulation, IL-4 and IL-13 have either inhibitory or stimulatory effects on LPS-induced TNF-α production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (18D'Andrea A. Ma X. Aste-Amezaga M. Paganin C. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). When added to the cell culture 20 h or more before LPS stimulation, IL-4 and IL-13 prime LPS-induced TNF-α production, whereas when added simultaneously or a few hours before LPS stimulation, IL-4 and IL-13 exert a marked inhibitory effect on the production of this cytokine (18D'Andrea A. Ma X. Aste-Amezaga M. Paganin C. Trinchieri G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Therefore, before analyzing the mechanism by which these cytokines inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production, we verified that IL-4 and IL-13, when added to the cell culture at the same time as LPS, could inhibit TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 and J774 cells. We performed experiments in which increasing concentrations of each cytokine were added to RAW 264.7 or J774 cell cultures simultaneously with LPS. TNF-α production was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a polyclonal anti-mouse TNF-α antibody to measure the totality of TNF-α produced in response to the various treatments. As shown in Fig. 1, LPS-induced TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells was inhibited by both cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, reaching 72 and 63% inhibition at the highest doses of IL-4 and IL-13 tested, respectively (IL-4, 5 ng/ml; and IL-13, 5 ng/ml). Similarly, the highest doses of IL-4 and IL-13 inhibited TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated J774 cells by 65 and 67%, respectively. TNF-α production by LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages results from a combination of TNF-α gene transcriptional activation and TNF-α mRNA translational derepression. To determine at which level IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production, we analyzed LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA accumulation in the presence or absence of each cytokine. Since TNF-α mRNA accumulation peaks 2 h after LPS addition to the cell culture (19Han J. Beutler B. Huez G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1090: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on TNF-α mRNA accumulation at this time point after LPS induction. We observed that whereas both cytokines inhibited LPS-induced TNF-α production, TNF-α mRNA accumulation was not affected by IL-4 and IL-13 in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2). In J774 cells, both IL-4 and IL-13 markedly suppressed LPS-induced TNF-α production, as previously observed. Northern blot analysis of TNF-α mRNA revealed that LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA accumulation was slightly reduced by IL-4 and IL-13 (Fig. 3). However, this 13% decrease cannot account by itself for the reduction of TNF-α production, which reached 60 and 80% in response to IL-4 and IL-13, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that the suppressive effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on TNF-α biosynthesis is mostly if not completely exerted at the translational level in both cell lines.Figure 3Simultaneous analysis of TNF-α production (A) and TNF-α mRNA accumulation (B) in LPS-stimulated J774 cells in the presence or absence of IL-4 or IL-13. The induction of TNF-α production by LPS in the presence of either cytokine is expressed in percent, attributing 100% to the level of TNF-α produced by cells treated by LPS alone in comparison with the level of TNF-α produced by unstimulated cells. Results are the means ± S.E. of four separate experiments. TNF-α mRNA accumulation was quantified as described under “Materials and Methods,” attributing 100% to the TNF-α mRNA level obtained for cells treated with LPS alone. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used as an internal control. Similar results were obtained in four separate experiments, with a maximal variation of 10% in the TNF-α mRNA level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the 3′-untranslated region of the TNF-α mRNA plays a central role in the translational control of TNF-α gene expression, we analyzed the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on the expression of a stably transfected CAT reporter gene containing this sequence (CMV3′TNF; Fig. 4) in RAW 264.7 cells. Indeed, former studies showed that in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with this construct, LPS stimulates the expression of the reporter gene by acting only at the translational level (13Han J. Huez G. Beutler B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1843-1848PubMed Google Scholar). In unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, the presence of the CMV promoter led to the constitutive accumulation of CMV3′TNF mRNA as evaluated by Northern blotting, but this mRNA was poorly translated in CAT protein (Fig.5 A). Upon stimulation with LPS, translational derepression resulted in CAT protein accumulation without significant variation of the CMV3′TNF mRNA. Exposure of the CMV3′TNF-transfected cells to LPS in combination with IL-4 or IL-13 markedly reduced the accumulation of CAT activity (Fig. 5 A) without affecting the level of CMV3′TNF mRNA. In contrast, IL-4 and IL-13 had no effect on the expression of the CMV3′TNFUA−construct, in which the UA-rich sequence is specifically deleted (see Figs. 4 and 5 B). As a control, we verified that the inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-α production by IL-4 and IL-13 in both transfected cell lines was equivalent to that observed in untransfected RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that IL-4 and IL-13 suppress the expression of the CMV3′TNF reporter gene at the translation level and require the presence of the UA-rich sequence to exert their inhibitory action on TNF-α mRNA translation.Figure 5IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit LPS-induced translation of a CAT reporter construct containing the full-length TNF-α 3′-untranslated region. A, CAT activity and Northern blot analysis of CAT mRNA accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells stably transfected with the CMV3′TNF construct after stimulation with LPS alone or in combination with IL-4 or IL-13; B, CAT activity and Northern blot analysis of CAT mRNA accumulation in RAW 264.7 cells stably transfected with the CMV3′TNFUA− construct after treatment with LPS alone or in combination with IL-4 or IL-13. Cells were plated at a density of 10 × 106 cells in 10-cm dishes. When the cells were adherent, they were either untreated or treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) alone or in combination with IL-4 (5 ng/ml) or IL-13 (5 ng/ml). After 3 h of incubation, the cells were harvested. 106 cells were used to assay CAT activity, and 9 × 106 cells were used to extract cytoplasmic RNA for Northern blot analysis. CAT production is expressed in percent, attributing 100% to the level of CAT activity produced by the cells treated with LPS alone. The results show one representative out of three independent experiments. A maximal 10% variation was observed in the level of CAT mRNA accumulation and in the degree of inhibition of CAT protein production by IL-4 and IL-13.

The mechanism by which IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production in monocytes/macrophages is still controversial. For instance, several studies show that IL-4 and IL-13 decrease LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA accumulation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (7Minty A. Chalon P. Derocq J.-M. Dumont X. Guillemont J.-C. Kaghad M. Labit C. Leplatois P. Liauzun P. Miloux B. Minty C. Casellas P. Loison G. Lupker J. Shire D. Ferrara P. Caput D.

However, one report describes that in mouse peritoneal macrophages, IL-4 does not modify TNF-α mRNA accumulation in response to LPS (24Gautam S. Tebo M.J. Hamilton A.T. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1725-1730PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the TNF-α gene in macrophages is regulated both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar). In unstimulated mouse macrophages, TNF-α production is severely repressed both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Indeed, under these conditions, TNF-α gene transcription is poor, and TNF-α mRNA translation is blocked. This translational repression is mediated by the UA-rich sequence located in the 3′-untranslated region of TNF-α mRNA. Macrophage activation by LPS leads to a 50-fold increase in TNF-α gene transcription and a 200-fold increase in TNF-α mRNA translation, leading to an overall 10,000-fold increase in TNF-α biosynthesis (1Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors: The Molecules and Their Emerging Role in Medicine. 1992; Google Scholar). Translational regulation of TNF-α mRNA also plays an important role under other circumstances. Indeed, LPS tolerance, which is characterized by an impaired TNF-α production in response to a secondary LPS challenge, is mainly due to a defective translation of TNF-α mRNA (14Marchant A. Gueydan C. Houzet L. Amraoui Z. Sels A. Huez G. Goldman M. Kruys V. J. Inflamm. 1996; 46: 114-123PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, production of TNF-α in response to infection by several viruses (Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, and Mengo virus) results to a great extent from TNF-α mRNA translational activation (25Willeaume V. Kruys V. Mijatovic T. Huez G. J. Inflamm. 1996; 46: 1-12Google Scholar). In our study, we aimed at determining the mechanism by which IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7, in which the regulation of TNF-α biosynthesis is well characterized. Furthermore, we also investigated this regulatory mechanism in another mouse macrophage cell line, J774, which also produces high levels of TNF-α in response to LPS. We first verified that IL-4 and IL-13 down-regulate TNF-α production in both cell types when added to the cell culture at the same time as LPS. We then demonstrated that under these conditions, both cytokines inhibit LPS-induced TNF-α production without significantly affecting TNF-α mRNA accumulation. Therefore, we conclude that IL-4 and IL-13 down-regulate TNF-α gene expression at the translational level. By analyzing the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on the expression of CAT reporter DNA constructs with or without the TNF-α mRNA UA-rich sequence in RAW 264.7 cells, we show that both IL-4 and IL-13 exert their inhibitory action on mRNA translation through the intermediate of this UA-rich sequence. Recently, we have identified in RAW 264.7 cells a protein complex that binds the TNF-α mRNA UA-rich sequence upon stimulation with LPS (26Gueydan C. Houzet L. Marchant A. Sels A. Huez G. Kruys V. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 479-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS-induced binding of this complex to the UA-rich sequence requires tyrosine phosphorylation since it is blocked by the protein tyrosine phosphorylation inhibitor herbimycin A. The observation that IL-4 and IL-13 affect TNF-α mRNA translation suggests that IL-4 and IL-13 might interfere with the binding of this protein complex to the UA-rich sequence upon LPS stimulation. The mechanism by which this phenomenon might occur is still speculative. However, it is well known that stimulation of macrophages by LPS promotes tyrosine phosphorylation of various members of the serine/threonine mitogen-activated protein kinase family, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase-like p38, and its human homologs CSBP1 and CSBP2, resulting in an increase in their kinase activity (27Weinstein S.L.

Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibitors of CSBP1 and CSBP2 kinase activity specifically impair LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA translation by preventing TNF-α mRNA recruitment into polysomes upon LPS stimulation (33Prichett W. Hand A. Shields J. Dunnington D. J. Inflamm. 1995; 45: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). These observations indicate that p38 and CSBPs are the LPS-signaling intermediates that mediate TNF-α mRNA translational activation most probably by triggering the binding of the protein complex to the UA-rich sequence. How do IL-4 and IL-13 down-regulate LPS-induced TNF-α mRNA translation? Both cytokines share a common receptor subunit, IL-4 receptor-α, which is essential for intracellular signaling (34Duschl A. Sebald W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar). Upon IL-4 or IL-13 stimulation, IL-4 receptor-α becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and recruits several signaling proteins including 4PS (also called IRS-2). 4PS, which also becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, forms a signaling complex containing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the adapter molecules GRB/Sos and Nck, and the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D (also known as SH-PTP2 or Syp) (35Welham M.J. Learmonth L. Bone H. Shrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12286-12296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 36Pruett W. Yuan Y. Rose E. Batzer A.G. Harada N. Skolnik E.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1778-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far, no downstream signals originating from GRB/Sos, Nck, and PTP1D have been observed upon IL-4/IL-13 stimulation, and the significance of their recruitment by 4PS remains unclear. We can speculate that upon IL-4 or IL-13 stimulation, the tyrosine phosphatase activity of PTP1D might down-regulate the kinase activity of p38 or CSBP1 and CSBP2 by controlling their phosphorylation status. Consequently, the LPS-induced binding of the protein complex to the UA-rich sequence and TNF-α mRNA translation would be inhibited. We thank Dr. W.

Two palindromes present within this 100-base pair region are important for transcription. The palindrome binding protein was purified to homogeneity and found to be identical to RBPJκ, the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)). Recombinant RBPJκ bound the ERBB-2 promoter with affinity comparable with that seen with well characterized RBPJκ binding sites. RBPJκ activated an ERBB-2 palindrome-containing promoter in 293 cells. Because inDrosophila Su(H) acts downstream of NOTCH and because NOTCH·Su(H)/RBPJκ stimulates transcription from target promoters, NOTCH-IC, a constitutively active form of NOTCH, was tested for effects on the ERBB-2 palindrome. NOTCH-IC further increased RBPJκ-mediated transcription on wild type but not mutantERBB-2 palindrome. Thus, RBPJκ can activateERBB-2 transcription and serve as an anchor to mediate NOTCH function on the ERBB-2 gene.

Thus, RBPJκ can activateERBB-2 transcription and serve as an anchor to mediate NOTCH function on the ERBB-2 gene. The human ERBB-2 gene, located on chromosome 17q21, encodes a 1255-amino acid protein-tyrosine kinase receptor (1Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H.

This receptor is widely expressed at higher levels during fetal development than in the adult, where it is detected primarily in epithelial cells (3Kokai Y. Cohen J.A. Drebin J.A. Greene M.I. Proc.

Amplification and overexpression is frequent in adenocarcinomas, especially in those arising in the breast and ovary where overexpression directly correlates with poorer patient outcomes (5Slamon D.J.

Protein overexpression is frequently the result of gene amplification; however, tumors are reported to overexpressERBB-2 mRNA and protein from single copy genes. Even with gene amplification, mRNA expression/gene is increased, indicating that transcriptional control mechanisms are important (6Slamon D.J. Godolphin W. Jones L.A. Holt J.A. Wong S.G. Keith D.E.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 605-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). To deduce transcriptional control mechanisms, the humanERBB-2 gene promoter has been sequenced and found to contain typical CAAT and TATA elements and four Alu sequences within 3.65 kilobases of the proximal promoter (8Ishii S.

A 100-bp region upstream of the TATA box increases promoter activity 200-fold. This 100-bp enhancer contains an Sp1 site near its 5′ end and a CAAT box near its 3′ end (11Chen Y. Gill G.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2269-2276PubMed Google Scholar). It also contains two palindromic sequences that are conserved in the rat and mouse ERBB-2 promoters (12White M.R. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 677-683PubMed Google Scholar). Using reporter constructs, these palindromes were shown to exert both positive and negative regulation of the human ERBB-2 promoter (11Chen Y. Gill G.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2269-2276PubMed Google Scholar). We previously described a palindrome binding protein (PBP) 1The abbreviations used are:PBPpalindrome binding proteinbpbase pair(s)EBVEpstein-Barr virusSu(H)Drosophila Suppressor of HairlessHes-1Hairy enhancer of splitE(spl)Drosophila Enhancer of splitICintracellular domainHAhemagglutininPal Idistal palindromePal IIproximal palindromeMbPal II mutated in both sitesEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayTES2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acidHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographywtPal II-TKwild type Pal II thymidine kinasemutPal II-TKmutated Pal II thymidine kinaseHes-TKHes-1 thymidine kinase that bound to the half-site of eachERBB-2 palindrome with the core recognition sequence TGGGAG (13Chen Y.

We now report that protein sequence analysis of purified PBP identifies it as RBPJκ (recombination signalbinding protein of immunoglobulinJκ gene). RBPJκ, which was initially cloned by Matsunami et al. (14Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaichi M. Honjo T.

Further analysis indicated that although RBPJκ contained a 40-amino acid region of homology to integrase, it lacked such activity (21Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Iwanari H. Maruyama S. Furukawa T. Matsunami N. Honjo T. J. Biochem.

Jessell T.M. Science. 1996; 274: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Enhancer of split (E(spl)) and the mouse Hairy enhancer of split (Hes-1) complexes are downstream of NOTCH and Su(H)/RBPJκ in this pathway (25Furukawa T. Kobayakawa Y. Tamura K.

Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). In the best studied mechanism, the intracellular domain (IC) of the transmembrane protein NOTCH is translocated to the nucleus with RBPJκ that serves as the site-specific DNA binding partner (26Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 27Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). The NOTCH-IC·RBPJκ complex activates transcription of basic helix loop proteins encoded by Hes-1. Events downstream of E(spl)/Hes-1 may be inhibitory (lateral inhibition in neuronal development (28Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar) and inhibition of myogenesis (29Kopan R. Nye J.S. Weintraub H. Development. 1994; 120: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or stimulatory. RBPJκ also acts in a protein complex with the non-DNA-binding EBNA2 to regulate genes involved in EBV latency (15Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G. Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The alteration of NOTCH that is necessary for nuclear translocation is reported to occur upon ligand binding (27Fortini M.E. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) via proteolysis (30Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Because RBPJκ could bind to the two palindromes in theERBB-2 promoter, we examined its activity using reporter gene constructs. We present evidence that RBPJκ stimulates promoter activity via wild type but not mutant ERBB-2 palindromic sequences; activity was markedly enhanced upon co-expression of the intracellular domain of NOTCH but was not affected by co-expression of EBNA2. These results suggest that ERBB-2 promoter activity is regulated by a protein complex that contains RBPJκ. 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmid DNA was transfected as a calcium phosphate precipitate (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). A β-galactosidase expression vector under control of a cytomegalovirus gene promoter was co-transfected with the luciferase reporter gene constructs. Luciferase activity was measured as described by de Wet et al. (34de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell extract were added to an assay reaction containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 5 mm ATP, and 15 mm MgSO4 in a volume of 0.35 ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 mm luciferin, and light readings were integrated over 10 s with a monolight 2110 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described by Norton and Coffin (35Norton P.A. Coffin J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 281-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter activity was expressed as light units of luciferase activity/A420 unit of β-galactosidase activity. The intracellular region of human NOTCH (NOTCH-IC) was a generous gift from Dr. David Baltimore, MIT. Viral EBNA2 and human RBPJκ cDNAs were generous gifts from Dr. Diane Hayward, The Johns Hopkins University. The NOTCH-IC and RBPJκ cDNAs were regenerated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into a modified pCDNA3 vector containing the luciferase gene translation initiation codon and the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. Eight copies of the wild type palindrome II (Pal II), four copies of palindrome II mutated in both sites (Mb), or four copies of theHes-1 RBPJκ binding site A were cloned in front of a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct to generate wtPal II-TK, mutPal II-TK, or Hes-TK, respectively. Binding reactions contained 2 × 104 cpm of DNA probe and varied amounts of protein with or without competitors or antibody in a final volume of 20 μl containing 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 4% glycerol. The mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature, loaded on a 4 or 6% acrylamide gel that had been run for 30 min at 4 °C in 0.5 × TBE (25 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA), and electrophoresed at 10 mA for 2 h. Gels were dried and autoradiographed overnight. Anti-HA antiserum was purchased from BABCO (Berkeley Antibody Co., Berkeley, CA).

Briefly, nuclear extract made from F9 cells was negatively absorbed to DE52 and to a DNA affinity column prepared using a mutant oligonucleotide (Mb) followed by two rounds of specific DNA affinity chromatography using palindrome II (CTGGGAGCGCGCTTGCTCCCAA). The final step was gel filtration chromatography. All active fractions eluting from the Superdex 200 fast protein liquid chromatography column were pooled and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After visualization by staining with Amido Black 10B, the protein band was excised and subjected to in situ digestion with trypsin. The excised band was treated with polyvinylpyrrolidone to prevent binding of the enzyme to the membrane. Digestion with trypsin (1 μg in 30 μl of 0.1 m TES, pH 8) was allowed to proceed overnight. The supernatants were then fractionated by reversed-phase HPLC. Fractions were collected manually, based on absorbance at 210 nm. Fractions corresponding to symmetrical peaks in the chromatogram were then subjected to chemical sequence analysis in an ABI470 (Applied Biosystems Inc.) protein sequencer (37Fischer W.H. Karr D. Jackson B. Park M. Vale W. Methods Neurosci. 1991; 6: 69-84Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectroscopy on a Bruker Reflex Time-of-Flight instrument. Two HPLC fractions of the protein digest were sequenced. One fraction yielded DGYIHYGQTVK (Fraction 29). The mass spectrum contained one strong signal at m/z = 1280. The other fraction was Q(TP)(AV)(QL)(VL)(DP)(AV)(DT)(DL)(PV)X SQL (Fraction 46) where residues given in parentheses were observed in the same sequencing cycle, indicating the presence of two peptides in that fraction. The mass spectrum contained a major signal atm/z = 1235 and a weak signal atm/z = 1750. A BLAST computer homology search (38Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71388) Google Scholar) revealed that all these sequences were identical to tryptic fragments of mouse/Xenopus RBPJκ. All molecular masses determined were within 0.05% of the masses calculated for the corresponding RBPJκ tryptic fragments. Previous studies showed that a 100-bp region upstream of the TATA box of the ERBB-2 gene promoter increased basal promoter activity 200-fold (11Chen Y. Gill G.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2269-2276PubMed Google Scholar). Two palindromic sequences are a prominent feature of this 100-bp enhancer element in addition to a strong Sp1 site near the 5′ end and a CAAT box near the 3′ end. The distal palindrome (Pal I) overlaps the Sp1 site, and the proximal palindrome, Pal II, overlaps the CAAT box (8Ishii S. Imamoto F. Yamanashi Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4374-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Tal M. King C.R. Kraus M.H. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Givol D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2597-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). When this 100-bp region was used as a probe in EMSA, proteins in F9 nuclear extract formed several complexes (Fig. 1). The complexes that could be effectively competed by an Sp1 consensus sequence are represented by Sp1 and proteins with a recognition motif similar to Sp1. A complex designated as PBP could not be competed by the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide but was effectively competed by the palindrome sequence. F9 cells thus contain a specific palindrome binding activity. To determine the identity of PBP, it was purified to homogeneity from F9 cells using ion exchange, DNA affinity, and gel filtration chromatographies and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fig. 2A summarizes the purification steps. Fig. 2B shows purified PBP before trypsin digestion, and the peptides identified by protein sequence analysis and mass spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 2C. A computer homology search revealed that all three sequences were identical to tryptic fragments of RBPJκ, a protein originally identified through binding to the Jκ immunoglobulin recombination signal sequence (14Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Nature. 1989; 342: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To verify that RBPJκ had palindrome binding activity, the protein was expressed as a HA-tagged fusion protein and transfected into 293 cells. Transient expression of HA-RBPJκ resulted in a large increase of PBP activity that could be competed by wild type Pal II but not by Mb oligonucleotides. An antibody against the HA tag supershifted the complex, supporting the sequence identification of PBP as RBPJκ (Fig.3). RBPJκ was originally isolated as a protein that bound to the Jκ recombination signal sequence consisting of a heptamer and a nonamer with a 23-bp spacer (14Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Nature. 1989; 342: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).

The consensus recognition sequence for the RBPJκ family has subsequently been determined as GTGGGAA, which is present in all RBPJκ binding sites characterized so far (22Tun T. Hamaguchi Y. Matsunami N. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Kawaichi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The PBP core site CTGGGAGC is close but not identical to the consensus sequence (13Chen Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To compare the affinity of ERBB-2 palindromes with other RBPJκ binding sites, palindromes as well as other characterized binding sites were used as unlabeled competitors in EMSA using partially purified F9 nuclear extract and Pal II as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4, the EBV Cp sequence is the optimal binding site. Pal I, Pal II, and half-site mutation M3 have affinity similar to that seen with the Hes-1 and pIX gene promoters. A perfect matching consensus site is located at −596 of theERBB-2 gene promoter (8Ishii S. Imamoto F. Yamanashi Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4374-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is, however, a poor competitor, indicating that flanking sequences significantly affect RBPJκ binding affinity for the core consensus sequence. To study the function of RBPJκ on the ERBB-2 promoter palindrome, RBPJκ was transfected into 293 cells along with reporter constructs containing wild type or mutant palindrome sequences (Fig. 5). The control reporter TK was induced 3-fold by RBPJκ. RBPJκ activated wtPal II-TK 16-fold, whereas mutPal II-TK was induced no more than the background activation seen with the vector TK. Constitutively active forms of mammalian NOTCH stimulated transcription of theHes-1 gene presumably through RBPJκ and its binding site on the Hes-1 promoter (26Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). The intracellular domain of NOTCH was transfected to determine whether an active form of human NOTCH (NOTCH-IC) had any effect on the ERBB-2 gene (Fig. 5). NOTCH-IC alone did not increase reporter activity above background. However, co-transfection of NOTCH-IC with RBPJκ activated wtPal II-TK activity 82-fold. NOTCH-IC failed to affect the basal stimulation of RBPJκ seen with TK and mutPal II-TK. The effect of NOTCH-IC was thus specific to the wild type ERBB-2 palindrome-containing gene and was dependent on RBPJκ. The effects of RBPJκ and NOTCH-IC on ERBB-2 palindromes were compared with effects on the Hes-1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 6, NOTCH-IC alone was sufficient to induce activation of the Hes-1 promoter, whereas RBPJκ alone did not stimulate the Hes-1 reporter. Co-transfection of RBPJκ and NOTCH-IC caused no change in activity beyond that observed with NOTCH-IC alone. EBNA2 is a well described activator of some RBPJκ response genes (15Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G. Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 36Ling P.D. Hsieh J.J. Ruf I.K. Rawlins D.R. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5375-5383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It up-regulates Cp and CD23 genes utilizing RBPJκ and its binding sites on extended promoter elements. When EBNA2 was transfected into 293 cells, it had no effect on ERBB-2 or Hes-1 promoter activity. EBNA2 also had no effect on activation mediated by RBPJκ and/or NOTCH-IC on either theERBB-2 palindromes or the Hes-1 site. Thus EBNA2 requires interactions additional to those mediated via RBPJκ (40Laux G. Adam B. Strobl L.J. Moreau-Gachelin F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5624-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas effects of NOTCH·RBPJκ occur on promoters containing only RBPJκ response elements. The present studies identify the protein (PBP) that binds to the two palindromes of the proximal enhancer of ERBB-2 as RBPJκ. Peptide sequences of tryptic fragments of PBP were identical to those of RBPJκ (14Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Yamamoto Y. Kuze K. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Nature. 1989; 342: 934-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 15Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5633-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although the ERBB-2 palindrome half-sites do not perfectly match the reported RBPJκ consensus binding sequence (22Tun T. Hamaguchi Y. Matsunami N. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Kawaichi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), PBP/RBPJκ bound to the palindromic sites with an affinity similar to that observed for the consensus sites. NFκB/Rel binding sites, which also resemble the palindrome half-sites, do not compete for PBP binding (13Chen Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Additionally, nuclear extracts containing epitope-tagged RBPJκ formed a specific complex with ERBB-2 palindromes. Previous studies identified two components of PBP (13Chen Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We suggest that these likely represent splicing variants of RBPJκ with varying N termini (23Amakawa R. Jing W. Ozawa K. Matsunami N. Hamaguchi Y. Matsuda F. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Genomics. 1993; 17: 306-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). RBPJκ is reported to function as a site-specific DNA binding protein that recruits additional transcription factors to target genes (17Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Meitinger C. Hinrichs R. Sakai T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Bornkamm G.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36Ling P.D. Hsieh J.J. Ruf I.K. Rawlins D.R. Hayward S.D. J.

A. 1994; 91: 7568-7572Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). RBPJκ represses transcription from its cognate site in the adenovirus pIX gene promoter (18Dou S. Zeng X. Cortes P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Honjo T. Vales L.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3310-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and from a Gal4 binding site when expressed as a Gal4 fusion (42Hsieh J.J. Hayward S.D. Science. 1995; 268: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A repression domain in RBPJκ was identified that coincided with that required for activation by EBNA2 (42Hsieh J.J. Hayward S.D. Science. 1995; 268: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). EBNA2 was thus deduced to activate transcription by both masking the repression domain of RBPJκ and by bringing a strong transactivation domain to the RBPJκ binding site. RBPJκ is the mammalian homolog of Drosophila Su(H), which functions in the NOTCH pathway and regulates development of the peripheral nervous system (19Furukawa T. Maruyama S. Kawaichi M. Honjo T. Cell. 1992; 69: 1191-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Schweisguth F. Posakony J.W. Cell. 1992; 69: 1199-1212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Su(H) interacts positively with NOTCH (43Bailey A.M. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2609-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 44Lecourtois M. Schweisguth F.

Cell. 1994; 79: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) observed that Su(H) was translocated to the nucleus when the transmembrane receptor NOTCH was activated by binding the ligand Delta. Interestingly, an oncogene from a human T lymphoblastic leukemia (TAN-1) was identified as a truncated NOTCH lacking much of the extracellular domain (31Ellisen L.W. Bird J. West D.C. Soreng A.L. Reynolds T.C. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1991; 66: 649-661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). Kopan et al.(30Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1683-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) presented evidence that proteolytic processing of NOTCH could generate NOTCH-IC sufficient to act via a complex with RBPJκ in the nucleus. RBPJκ binds to the intracellular domain of NOTCH, and expression of RBPJκ with ectodomain-deleted forms of NOTCH (δEC-NOTCH), both with and without retention of the transmembrane domain, activates transcription from Hes-1 and EBV C promoters (26Jarriault S. Brou C. Logeat F. Schroeter E.H. Kopan R. Israel A. Nature. 1995; 377: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar, 46Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5663-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). δEC-NOTCH·RBPJκ and EBNA2·RBPJκ complexes exhibited similar transcriptional enhancement on EBV C promoter sites (46Lu F.M. Lux S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5663-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RBPJκ stimulated transcription from a reporter gene containing wild type but not mutant ERBB-2 palindrome sequences. This activity was greatly enhanced by NOTCH-IC. Using immunofluorescence, we found that NOTCH-IC and RBPJκ localize in the nuclei of 293 cells (data not shown). These observations support models of RBPJκ·NOTCH-IC heterodimers that act to enhance transcription from RBPJκ response elements. Comparison of ERBB-2 palindrome and Hes-1 elements in reporter gene assays indicates a stronger effect of transfected RBPJκ alone on ERBB-2 and a stronger effect of transfected NOTCH-IC alone on Hes-1. This may reflect a higher affinity in vivo of endogenous RBPJκ for the Hes-1 site. RBPJκ was not inhibitory on either site. On these sites, EBNA2 had no effect. This suggests that stimulatory effects of EBNA2 require interaction with additional proteins such as Spi-1/Spi-B, which bind to a more extended EBV C element (40Laux G. Adam B. Strobl L.J. Moreau-Gachelin F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5624-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several recognition elements have been identified within the extendedERBB-2 promoter. Two AP2 and two Sp1 consensus binding sequences are found at −397, −359, −369, and −314, respectively, relative to the translation start site (8Ishii S. Imamoto F. Yamanashi Y. Toyoshima K. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4374-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Several breast cancer cell lines are reported to have a strong AP2 activity that increases expression via the response element located at −397 bp (47Bosher J.M. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A stimulatory factor that binds to the promoter region 3′ of the TATA box has also been described (48Sarkar F.H. Smith M.R. Hoover T. Princler G. Crissman J.D. Visscher D.W. Longo D.L. Kung H. Raziuddin J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12285-12289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of the rat ERBB-2 promoter have identified a transacting factor that binds at −466 to −456 bp (49Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and inhibition by co-expression of Rb (50Yu D. Matin A. Hung M.C. J. Biol.

However, deletional analysis of the humanERBB-2 gene identified the region between −329 and −230 bp as the major strong enhancer region; it contains two functionally important palindromes (11Chen Y. Gill G.N. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2269-2276PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of RBPJκ, which binds to each palindrome half-site (13Chen Y. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), is strongly augmented by NOTCH-IC. Interestingly, mice that contain homozygous deletions ofERBB-2 exhibit defects in development of cardiac trabeculae (53Lee K.F. Simon H. Chen H. Bates B. Hung M.C. Hauser C. Nature. 1995; 378: 394-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), but development of cranial neural crest-derived sensory ganglia and motor neurons was also impaired, implying important roles forERBB-2 in both cardiac and neural development. Control ofERBB-2 expression by NOTCH signaling pathways that are known to be important in neuronal development in transgenic mice thus appears plausible.

https://openalex.org/W2046860202,"The human blood group A and B glycosyltransferase enzymes are highly homologous and the alteration of four critical amino acid residues (Arg-176 → Gly, Gly-235 → Ser, Leu-266 → Met, and Gly-268 → Ala) is sufficient to change the enzyme specificity from a blood group A to a blood group B glycosyltransferase. To carry out a systematic study, a synthetic gene strategy was employed to obtain their genes and to allow facile mutagenesis. Soluble forms of a recombinant glycosyltransferase A and a set of hybrid glycosyltransferase A and B mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli in high yields, which allowed them to be kinetically characterized extensively for the first time. A functional hybrid A/B mutant enzyme was able to catalyze both A and B reactions, with thekcat being 5-fold higher for the A donor. Surprisingly, even a single amino acid replacement in glycosyltransferase A with the corresponding residue from glycosyltransferase B (Arg-176 → Gly) produced enzymes with glycosyltransferase A activity only, but with very large (11-fold) increases in the kcat and increased specificity. The increases observed in kcat are among the largest obtained for a single amino acid change and are advantageous for the preparative scale synthesis of blood group antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1986070215,"Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) is 130-kDa member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily that localizes to cell-cell borders of confluent endothelial cells and has been shown to play a role in the control of endothelial sheet migration and leukocyte transmigration through the endothelium. The cytoplasmic tail plays an important role in the modulation of PECAM-1 function. Mutation of tyrosine 663 or 686 in the cytoplasmic tail reduces phosphorylation and mutation of 686 is associated with a reduction in PECAM-1-mediated inhibition of cell migration (1). We have previously noted that these two tyrosine residues are surrounded by consensus sequences for Src homology 2 (SH2) domain binding (1, 2), and the experiments presented explore the potential for PECAM-1-Src and PECAM-1-SH2 domain interactions. PECAM-1 is more highly phosphorylated in endothelial cells overexpressing c-Src, and inin vitro kinase assays, c-Src can phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-PECAM cytoplasmic tail fusion protein. The phosphorylated fusion protein associates with the bead-bound c-Src. This association appears to be mediated by Src-SH2 domain, because PECAM-1 can be precipitated by a GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix. The binding to the GST-Src-SH2 affinity matrix correlates directly with the level of PECAM-1 phosphorylation, because more PECAM-1 is precipitated from c-Src overexpressors and from wild-type rather than Tyr663 → Phe and Tyr686 → Phe mutant PECAM-1 expressors. Yet unidentified phosphoproteins can also be coimmunoprecipitated with wild-type but not mutant PECAM-1. Finally, we note the similarity of the PECAM-1 cytoplasmic domain sequence to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. Our data begin to delineate how tyrosines 663 and 686 may play a role in mediating PECAM-1 signal transduction."

Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) that are LRP-deficient due to targeted gene disruption and exotoxin selection (MEF-2), heterozygous fibroblasts (PEA-10), and wild-type fibroblasts (MEF-1) were compared. When cultures were denuded of cells in a 1-mm-wide strip, all three cell types migrated into the denuded area. The MEF-2 cells migrated nearly twice as rapidly as the MEF-1 cells or PEA-10 cells. The difference in migration velocity was duplicated in culture wells that were precoated with serum or vitronectin and partially duplicated in wells coated with fibronectin but not in wells coated with type I collagen or Matrigel. uPA was detected in MEF-2 conditioned medium (CM) at a concentration of 0.30 ± 0.02 nm, which was 13-fold higher than the level detected in MEF-1 CM or PEA-10 CM, suggesting one potential mechanism for the enhanced migration of MEF-2 cells. uPAR was also increased on MEF-2 cells by 4–5-fold, as determined by PI-PLC release, and by 2.5-fold, as determined by a uPA/uPAR activity assay. Mannosamine treatment, which down-regulates cell-surface uPAR, decreased MEF-2 migration by 40% without significantly affecting MEF-1 migration. MEF-2 CM, which is uPA-rich, increased the rate of MEF-1 migration, and MEF-1 CM did not.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas in migrating cells, uPAR localizes primarily to the leading edge (19Estreicher A. Muhlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 20Gyetko M.R. Todd R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin.

This shift in uPAR subcellular distribution, in migrating cells, allows focused digestion of ECM only where it is required for cellular penetration of tissue boundaries. In addition to promoting activation of cell-surface proteinases, uPAR expresses activities that are independent of uPA proteolytic activity. Ligation of uPAR with uPA or with uPA derivatives that lack enzyme activity promotes protein kinase activity (21Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). uPAR may also affect cellular adhesion and migration independently of ligand (20Gyetko M.R. Todd R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 27Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar), and this is explained, at least in part, by the fact that uPAR functions as a receptor for vitronectin (28Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J.

Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). uPAR has been recovered from cells in multimeric complexes with protein kinases and integrins (21Busso N. Masur S.K. Lazega D. Waxman S. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 23Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weidle U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Furthermore, physical association of uPAR with integrins regulates integrin function and apparently promotes cellular adhesion to vitronectin (27Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The uPA inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), binds to vitronectin and inhibits binding of uPAR (29Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and αVβ3 (31Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) to vitronectin. Thus, uPA/uPAR and the integrins may form an interdependent system for the regulation of cellular adhesion and migration. Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is a multifunctional receptor that mediates binding and endocytosis of free uPA (30Higazi A.A.-R. Upson R.H. Cohen R.L. Manuppello J. Bognacki J. Henkin J. McCrae K.R. Kounnas M.Z. Strickland D.K. Preissner K.T. Lawler J. Cines D.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 542-551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and uPAR-associated uPA·PAI-1 complex (33Herz J. Clouthier D.E. Hammer R.E. Cell. 1992; 71: 411-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 34Nykjaer A. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Lookene A. Moestrup S.K. Petersen C.M. Weber W. Beisiegel U. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15048-15055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When uPAR-associated uPA·PAI-1 complex undergoes LRP-mediated endocytosis, the uPAR may be internalized as well (35Conese M. Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Cremona O. Pardi R. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. Blasi F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1609-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, LRP may shuttle large macromolecular complexes from the cell surface into intracytoplasmic pools. The goal of the present investigation was to determine whether LRP regulates cellular migration. We hypothesized that LRP might regulate migration based on its function as an endocytic receptor for uPA/uPAR; however, other LRP ligands, including thrombospondin, activated α2-macroglobulin, and various Serpin-proteinase complexes (36Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) could be also be involved. We chose, for these experiments, to examine murine embryonic fibroblasts that are genetically deficient in LRP (MEF-2). Willnow and Herz (37Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) initially isolated these cells from embryos lacking one functional LRP allele due to targeted gene disruption. The second LRP allele was then eliminated by a gene conversion event under Pseudomonas exotoxin A selection. The results of our studies demonstrate that LRP-deficient fibroblasts migrate approximately 2-fold faster than wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-1), when the migration surface is vitronectin-coated. The MEF-2 cells migrated about 50% faster than MEF-1 cells on fibronectin-coated plates; however, the two cell types migrated equivalently on Matrigel- and type I collagen-coated plates. The LRP-deficient fibroblasts accumulated greatly increased levels of single chain uPA (scuPA) in conditioned medium and expressed increased levels of cell-surface uPAR. Evidence is presented to suggest that the enhanced activity of the uPA/uPAR system, in the MEF-2 cells, is responsible for the increased rate of migration of these cells on vitronectin-coated surfaces. We propose that LRP plays a critical role as a regulator of uPA/uPAR-enhanced cellular migration. [Glu1]Plasminogen was purified from human plasma by the method of Deutsch and Mertz (38Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Vitronectin was purified from human plasma by the method of Yatohgoet al. (39Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Mannosamine, amiloride,p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate HCl, and type I collagen were from Sigma. Fibronectin was from Promega and the ECM preparation from EH Sarcoma cells, Matrigel®, was from Collaborative Research. H-d-valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroanilide (VLK-p NA) was from Chromogenix, and H-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone was from Bachem. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Rat receptor-associated protein (RAP) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified as described previously (40Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.A. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The glutathioneS-transferase-RAP expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). RAP binds to LRP and inhibits binding of all other known LRP ligands (36Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The KD for RAP binding to LRP is about 5–20 nm (37Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.A. Chu C.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); intact glutathioneS-transferase-rat RAP binds to murine LRP without loss of affinity (37Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibody specific for uPAR, antibody αD2+3, was raised in rabbits that were immunized with a purified chymotryptic fragment of soluble human uPAR that contains domains 2 and 3 of the receptor. MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were obtained as a gift from Drs. Thomas Willnow and Joachim Herz; however, the MEF-2 cells are now available from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). MEF-1 cells are wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from the same mouse strain as the MEF-2 cells. PEA-10 cells were obtained from the ATCC. PEA-10 cells are also embryonic fibroblasts obtained from the same mouse strain as the MEF-2 cells but containing a single disrupted LRP allele (37Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LRP expression by PEA-10 cells is decreased by 50% compared with wild-type MEF-1 cells, as determined by the binding and degradation of various LRP ligands (37Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell cultures were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Migration of MEF-1, MEF-2, and PEA-10 cells was studied according to the method of Glass et al. (42Glass W.F., II Teng P.R. Haney L.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2230-2243PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 35-mm culture wells (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.) and grown until 95% confluent. Since the medium contained serum, the cell culture wells became coated with vitronectin, which served as the major attachment and spreading factor (43Haymen E.G. Pierschbacher M.D. Ohgren Y. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4003-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To initiate an experiment, a 0.8–1.0-mm-wide band down the center of the culture was denuded of cells using a rubber policeman. The cells were then washed with DMEM, 10% FBS and returned to the incubator, at 37 °C, in fresh medium. The external surface of each well was marked with a pen so that the identical field of cells could be viewed by phase contrast microscopy and photographed at different times. Photographs were taken immediately after denuding the cultures and at various times thereafter. In each photograph, distances between the two opposing lead edges of cellular migration (at opposite sides of the denudation area) were measured at eight evenly spaced intervals, using a Micro-Plan II Image Analyzer (Computer Systems). Photographs taken at different times were matched using the ink marks. Migration distance (M) was then calculated as shown in Equation 1.M=c(Dt=x−Dt=0)/2Equation 1 Dt = x is the average distance between the lead edges of migration at a specific time;Dt= 0 is the average distance immediately after denudation. c is a constant used to convert migration distances into actual units (microns), based on the power of microscopic magnification and the enlargement used to generate the prints. Some migration experiments were performed in 35-mm bacterial culture dishes (Falcon) precoated with various extracellular matrix proteins, including vitronectin (20 μg/cm2), type I collagen (20 μg/cm2), fibronectin (5 μg/cm2), a 1:20 dilution of Matrigel, or 10% FBS. Precoating was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37 °C. The wells were then blocked with bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C and sterilized overnight under UV light. Cells were added to the wells and grown to 95% confluence in DMEM with 10% FBS. Migration was then studied as described above except for the use of serum-free medium (DMEM with 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB) after denudation. The bacterial culture dishes promote binding of most proteins in general, whereas tissue culture-treated plastic preferentially adsorbs vitronectin. To test for the contribution of uPAR to MEF migration, cultures were preincubated with 10 mm mannosamine (Sigma) for 6 h at 37 °C. Denudation was then performed, and migration was studied in DMEM with 10% FBS + 10 mm mannosamine. To test for the contribution of uPA to MEF migration, conditioned medium (CM) from MEF-1 cells or from MEF-2 cells was concentrated 20-fold, using a Centricon concentrator with a 10-kDa exclusion filter (Amicon), and then diluted 1:10 into MEF-1 cultures. In a second protocol, MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were washed with mild acid to dissociate uPAR-associated uPA prior to performing migration assays. The acid-washing protocol involved incubating the cultures with 50 mm glycine HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 3.0, for 3 min at 25 °C. The medium was rapidly neutralized by diluting a solution of 0.5 m HEPES, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5, 1:5, directly into the acid-containing culture wells. The cells were then washed and migration assays were performed under serum-free conditions (DMEM + 20 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB). The 2-kilobase pair complete coding sequence of the mouse uPA cDNA (obtained from ATCC) was excised with Xba I/Sma I to generate the probe for Northern blots. The probe for PAI-1 was a 2-kilobase pairSac I/Eco RI fragment of the mouse PAI-1 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Michael Cole (Princeton University). The probe for mouse uPAR was generated by reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction using total cellular RNA from the mouse macrophage-like cell line, RAW 264.7, as a template and the primers designed by Hayden and Seeds (44Hayden S.M. Seeds N.W. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2307-2317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out using the GeneAmp RNA polymerase chain reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer). Total RNA (1 μg), RNasin (1.0 unit), antisense uPAR primer (0.25 μm), reverse transcriptase (2.5 units), and dNTPs (each at 1 mm) were reacted at 42 °C for 15 min, at 99 °C for 5 min, and then on ice for 5 min. The polymerase chain reaction amplification reaction, containing reverse transcription products, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 1.5 mmMgCl2, pH 8.5, was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min. Total RNA was isolated from MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) were denatured with glyoxal, subjected to electrophoresis in 1% (w/v) agarose gels, and electrotransferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad). Following electroblotting, the RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation and prehybridized in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE, 2 × Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 1.0% salmon testes DNA, at 42 °C for 18–24 h. The cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN), using the Random Primers Labeling System (Life Technologies, Inc.), and hybridized with membrane-immobilized RNA for 24 h at 42 °C. As a control for load, the membranes were also hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (PGAD) cDNA (45LaMarre J.L. Wolf B.B. Kittler E.L.W. Quesenberry P.J. Gonias S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1219-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After hybridization, membranes were washed with 0.1 × SSPE, 1.0% SDS at 65 °C. Specific hybridization of probes was analyzed by PhosphorImager analysis or by exposure to x-ray film, followed by densitometry. MEF-1, MEF-2, and PEA-10 cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM without serum at 37 °C. The conditioned medium (CM) was then recovered and concentrated 20-fold using Centricon concentrators with 10-kDa exclusion filters (Amicon). To determine uPA activity, CM was diluted 1:15 into a spectrophotometer cuvette containing 0.94 μm [Glu1]plasminogen and 0.65 mm VLK-p NA in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Amiloride (1 mm) was also present in solution with the plasminogen and VLK-p NA in some experiments. Amiloride is a selective inhibitor of uPA that does not inhibit tissue-type plasminogen activator (46Vassalli J. Belin D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 214: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Immediately after adding CM, the absorbance at 406 nm was measured. Subsequent measurements were made at 15-s intervals for up to 2000 s. The temperature was maintained at 22 °C throughout the study. Absorbance measurements were plotted as a function of time and then transformed using a first-derivative function to yield plots of dA406 nm/dt against time (t). Kinetic constants for the hydrolysis of VLK-p NA by plasmin (kcat of 12 s−1; Km of 180 μm) were used to convert y axes from dA406 nm/dt to plasmin concentration (47Anonick P.K. Gonias S.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Maximum velocities of plasmin formation were measured only after an initial lag-phase of 1000 s, the cause of which is described under “Results.” To assess the state of the plasminogen in the activation mixture at 1000 s, samples of the activation solution were treated with p-nitrophenylp′-guanidinobenzoate HCl and H-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone to inactivate any plasmin and uPA. The samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions. This analysis demonstrated that the fraction of the plasminogen, which had been activated by CM at 1000 s, was undetectable by Coomassie-staining (results not shown). Conversion of [Glu1]plasminogen into the more readily activated derivative, [Lys78]plasminogen, was also undetectable. Thus, we used kinetic constants for the activation of [Glu1]plasminogen by two-chain uPA (tcuPA) (kcat of 3.6 s−1;Km of 78 μm) to convert our measured velocities of plasminogen activation into actual tcuPA concentrations (48Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. De Cock F. Collen D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presented values are estimates since the original kinetic parameters (48Lijnen H.R. Van Hoef B. De Cock F. Collen D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1864-1872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were determined with recombinant human tcuPA and the CM samples contain murine tcuPA. Also, in continuous assays, such as that performed here, plasmin substrates can affect velocities of plasminogen activation (49Kolev K. Owen W.G. Machovich R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1246: 239-245Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar); however, these potential sources of error were identical for the analysis of each CM sample. Therefore, the relative amounts of uPA in the CM samples should not have been affected. In control experiments, medium which had not been exposed to cells (DMEM) did not activate [Glu1]plasminogen. When [Glu1]plasminogen was omitted from the CM-containing activation solutions, VLK-p NA hydrolysis was not observed. MEF-1 and MEF-2 cells were treated with 0.5 units/ml PI-PLC in Earle's balanced salt solution, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was then recovered and concentrated 7-fold in a Centricon concentrator with a 10-kDa exclusion filter (Amicon). Equal amounts of PI-PLC-conditioned medium (corrected for differences in total cellular protein per well) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% slabs and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore).

The first two genes in the operon, arsR and arsD, were previously shown to encode trans-acting repressor proteins. ArsR controls the basal level of expression of the operon, while ArsD controls maximal expression. Thus, action of the two repressors form a homeostatic regulatory circuit that maintains the level of ars expression within a narrow range. In this study, we demonstrate that ArsD binds to the same site on the ars promoter element as ArsR but with 2 orders of magnitude lower affinity. The results of gel shift assays demonstrate that ArsD is released from the ars DNA promoter by phenylarsine oxide, sodium arsenite, and potassium antimonyl tartrate (in order of effectiveness), the same inducers to which ArsR responds. Using the quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence to measure the affinity of the repressor for inducers, apparent Kd values for Sb(III) and As(III) of 2 and 60 μm, respectively, were obtained. These results demonstrate that the arsR-arsD pair provide a sensitive mechanism for sensing a wide range of environmental heavy metals.

The arsenical resistance (ars) operon of resistance plasmids R773 and R46 encodes an oxyanion extrusion pump that produces resistance to arsenite and antimonite (1Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The operon has five genes, ArsR, -D, -A, -B, and -C (2Chen C.-M. Misra T.K. Silver S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol.

ArsR and ArsD are bothtrans-acting repressor proteins that homeostatically regulate the levels of ars transcript (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Wu J. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although both are 13-kDa homodimers, they share no sequence similarity. ArsR is an As(III)/Sb(III)-responsive repressor with high affinity for its operator site that controls the basal level of expression of the operon (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of arsenite or antimonite produces dissociation of ArsR from the operator site, permitting transcription. As the levels of transcript rise, synthesis of the integral membrane ArsB protein becomes toxic, limiting growth. ArsD is a second regulator that controls the upper level of expression of the operon, preventing overexpression of ArsB (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Together, ArsR and ArsD form a regulatory circuit that controls the basal and maximal levels of expression of thears operon. Dual regulatory proteins in a single operon are rare; in metalloregulatory systems only the MerR/MerD pair has been reported (8Yu H. Mukhopadhyay D. Misra T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15697-15702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it was not possible to measure ArsD binding toars promoter DNA (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It was not clear whether ArsD interacted with DNA or mRNA. In addition, initial observations suggested that ArsD did not respond to arsenite or antimonite. In this report, we demonstrate that ArsD binds to DNA just 5′ to ars promoter, the same site occupied by ArsR before induction. Moreover, interaction of ArsD with arsenite, antimonite, or the organic arsenical phenylarsine oxide (PAO) 1The abbreviations used are: PAO, phenylarsine oxide; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ONPG,O-nitrophenylβ-d-galactopyranoside. was demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro assays. In gel shift assays, PAO was the most effective inducer. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ArsD was quenched by arsenicals and antimonials. Titration of the fluorescence decrease allowed determination of the affinity for inducers. These results demonstrate that ArsR and ArsD control expression of the operon by binding to the same operator site but at different times. Low extracellular concentrations of arsenical or antimonial oxysalts induce the operon by binding to ArsR, which then dissociates from the operator element. When the intracellular concentration of ArsD becomes sufficient to saturate the operator, transcription is again repressed. At higher extracellular concentrations of metalloid salt, the intracellular concentration of As(III) or Sb(III) increases to a level that produces dissociation of ArsD from the operator, producing an increase in ars expression. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are described in Table I. E. coli cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml), kanamycin (80 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml) or chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) were added as required. For protein expression, 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) or 20 μm sodium arsenite was used as inducer, except where otherwise noted.Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain/plasmidGenotype/descriptionReferenceStrainJM109recA1 supE44 endA1 hsdR17 gyrA96 relA1 thiΔ(lac-proAB) F′ [traD36 proAB + lacIq lacZΔM15]9Sambrook J.

Endo- and exonuclease digestions, DNA fragments separations and isolations, ligations, transformations, and Klenow fragment fill-in were performed according to standard procedures (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar) unless otherwise noted. ArsD was purified from culture of strain BL21(DE3) bearing plasmid pT7–5-D (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C overnight with aeration in 0.2 liters of LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. The cultures were diluted into 2 liters of prewarmed Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin. At an A600 of 0.6–0.8, production of ArsD was induced by the addition of 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The pelleted cells were suspended in 5 ml of buffer A/g of wet cells and disrupted by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. Unbroken cells and membranes were removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant solution containing ArsD was loaded onto a 2.5-cm diameter column filled to 20 cm with Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with 512 ml of a linear gradient of 0–0.3 m NaCl in the same buffer. Fractions of 4 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207472) Google Scholar). Fractions containing ArsD were pooled and concentrated. The protein was applied to a 2-cm diameter column filled to 100 cm with Sephacryl S-200 (Pharmacia) and eluted with buffer A. ArsD-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of ArsD in purified preparations was determined using a modification of the method of Lowry et al. (11Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays were performed as described previously (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 160-base pair DNA fragment containing thears operator/promoter and partial arsR gene was generated by PCR. After digestion with restriction endonucleases, either end of this fragment was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and purified with Wizard cleanup system (Promega). Overnight cultures of E. coli strain HMS174 (DE3) harboring pBGD23 or pBGDΔR1 and pArsD plasmids were diluted 50-fold to 2 ml of fresh Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were induced with varying concentrations of sodium arsenite and IPTG and grown for another 2 h. One ml of cells was pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in 0.5 ml of a buffer consisting of 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4 and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0 (Z buffer) (12Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1972; Google Scholar). The cells were permeabilized by adding 1 drop of 0.1% SDS and 2 drops of chloroform with mixing. The reaction mixture contained 0.02 ml of cells, 0.1 ml of 8 mg/ml O-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 0.88 ml of Z buffer. Enzyme activity was estimated from the release of nitrophenol at 420 nm and 37 °C and expressed in Miller units (12Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1972; Google Scholar) Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured at room temperature using an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The slit widths for excitation and emission were 4 mm. Reagents were added in 1–2-μl volumes with a microliter syringe through a light-protected port to the cuvette containing 2-ml samples, and the solutions were continuously stirred during the measurement. Dilution effects were negligible. Fluorescence intensity changes were recorded at 336 nm. To investigate thein vivo repression of ars expression by ArsD, two reporter gene constructs were used. In the first, pBGD23, thelacZ gene was fused in frame with the 23rd codon ofarsD. From this plasmid, both ArsR and an ArsD-β-galactosidase reporter are synthesized. In the second, pBGDΔR1, base pairs 27–259 of the 351-base pair arsR gene were deleted (13Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arsD gene was present on a compatible plasmid, pArsD. In this plasmid, arsD is under control of the T7 promoter, and in strains with the DE3 lysogen, the T7 RNA polymerase, which is under control of the lac promoter, can be induced with IPTG. In the absence of IPTG, expression of the reporter gene from plasmid pBGD23 was low due to the presence of ArsR (Fig. 1 A). Addition of 10 μmsodium arsenite in the absence of IPTG induced reporter gene expression by dissociation of ArsR from the operator/promoter. Simultaneous induction of ArsD with IPTG decreased reporter gene expression, demonstrating repression by ArsD. In the absence of the arsD gene, there was no effect of IPTG on repression by ArsR (Fig.1 B). The higher level of reporter gene expression observed in this experiment compared with the presence of ArsD (Fig.1 A) is most likely due to the leakiness of thelac promoter so that some ArsD is produced even in the absence of IPTG. Although it was previously reported that repression by ArsD was not affected by inducer, in that experiment, ArsD was expressed at levels that were too high to respond to arsenite (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this study, when the concentration of sodium arsenite was increased, repression by ArsD was relieved, indicating that ArsD responds to inducer (Fig.1 C). Derepression of ArsD required up to 10-fold more sodium arsenite than derepression of ArsR, suggesting that ArsD has lower affinity for inducer than ArsR. In the absence of the arsD gene, repression by ArsR was fully relieved by 10 μmsodium arsenite (Fig. 1 D). ArsR and ArsD act independently and do not require each other for repression. Expression of the reporter gene from plasmid pBGDΔR1, which lacks the arsR gene, was constitutive, not requiring arsenite (Fig. 1 E). Addition of IPTG to induce ArsD from plasmid pArsD produced repression, demonstrating that ArsD does not require ArsR for repression. In the absence of ArsR, repression by ArsD was relieved by high concentrations of sodium arsenite, demonstrating that ArsD alone responds to inducer (Fig. 1 G). The control experiments with vector plasmid in place of pArsD show that the effects of IPTG and arsenite require ArsD (Fig. 1, F andH). ArsD was purified by a combination of anion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Approximately 35 mg of purified ArsD could be obtained from 2 liters of cell culture. From the intensity of Coomassie Blue staining of samples separated by SDS-PAGE, ArsD was judged to be >95% homogeneous (Fig.2, inset). A small amount of dimer was observed in the purified preparations, as judged by immunoblotting with anti-ArsD serum. Considering the number of cysteines in ArsD, it is possible that the dimer is held together by disulfide bonds despite denaturation in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol. The molecular mass of purified ArsD was determined by gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S-200 column (Fig. 2). From the nucleotide sequence of thearsD gene, the predicted mass of ArsD is 13,218 Da (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). From its elution position, a mass of approximately 26 kDa was determined, consistent with an ArsD homodimer. Gel mobility shift assays were used to examine the DNA binding activity of ArsD. A 160-base pair32P-labeled PCR fragment containing the R773 ars promoter was used as target DNA. ArsD was able to retard the migration of this DNA probe (Fig. 3, top). No retardation of the labeled probe was observed when a 50-fold excess of unlabeled target DNA was added. From the least squares fit, theKd of ArsD for the operator/promoter DNA was calculated to be 65 μm (Fig. 3, bottom). This compares with a Kd of 0.33 μm for ArsR (13Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2 orders of magnitude less than ArsD. The repressor could be dissociated from its promoter by addition of inducer (Fig. 4). Either arsenite or antimonite produced dissociation although at relatively high amounts. In gel shift experiments, ArsR similarly dissociated only at high concentrations of inducer (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the organoarsenical PAO was 100-fold more effective than either of the inorganic oxyanions. ArsR similarly is induced most effectively with PAO (13Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Xu C. Shi W. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2427-2432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Using purified ArsD, the site of binding to the R773 ars regulatory region was analyzed by DNase I protection assays. Protected regions found on both the coding strand from nucleotides −61 to −37 (Fig. 5 A) and the noncoding strand from nucleotides −64 to −40 (Fig.5 B). Protection was prevented by addition of arsenite (Fig.5 B). This is the same region protected by ArsR (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsD has two tryptophan residues, Trp35 and Trp97. The intrinsic fluorescence of ArsD tryptophans exhibited a considerable enhancement and blue shift of the maximum emission wavelength (Fig. 6, curve A) compared with free tryptophan (Fig. 6, curve C). The fluorescence of ArsD following denaturation with guanidine was similar to free tryptophan (Fig. 6, curve B). These results indicate that one or both tryptophan residues are in less polar environment than free tryptophan. ArsD tryptophan fluorescence reported inducer binding. In the presence of inducer, the fluorescence was quenched. The magnitude of fluorescence quenching was dependent on inducer concentration (Fig. 7 A). Quenching as a function of inducer concentration allowed the determination of apparent affinity constants of approximately 2 μm for Sb(III) and 60 μm for As(III) (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Effect of inducers on ArsD tryptophan fluorescence. Panel A, the effect of potassium antimonyl tartrate on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was examined in the presence of the indicated concentrations of potassium antimonyl tartate. Curve A, none; curve B, 1 μm; curve C, 2 μm; curve D, 5 μm; curve E, 15 μm;curve F, 40 μm; curve G, 90 μm; curve H, 190 μm; andcurve I, 390 μm. Panel B, the decrease in fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 336 nm was determined at each concentration of potassium antimonyl tartrate (▴) or sodium arsenite (▪). Apparent Kd values of 2 μm for Sb(III) and 60 μm for As(III) were calculated from the double reciprocal plot of the metalloid concentration plotted against the percentage decrease in fluorescence. These experiments were repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Arsenical resistance (ars) operons produce resistance to the metalloids As(III) and Sb(III) by encoding an active efflux system for their oxyanions (1Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 273-277Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Resistance to As(V) is conferred by an additional protein, ArsC, that reduces pentavalent to trivalent arsenical, the substrate of the extrusion system. The first two genes of the ars operon of E. coli plasmid R773,arsR and arsD, encode trans-acting regulatory proteins (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Wu J. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1331-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although both are small proteins (117 amino acid residues for ArsR and 120 for ArsD), they exhibit no significant sequence similarity. While ArsR had been shown to bind to thears operator/promoter (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binding of ArsD could not be measured (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The role of ArsR was shown to be repression of the operon to a basal level, with induction through sensing of environmental metalloid. The role of ArsD is related to prevention of toxicity resulting from production of the membrane protein ArsB. In this study, ArsD was shown to bind to the same operator region ofars DNA as ArsR. Neither required the other for DNA binding. Physiologically, their binding would be temporally distinct. The affinity of ArsD for ars operator/promoter DNA was shown to be 2 orders of magnitude less than ArsR. Small amounts of both ArsR and ArsD would be synthesized at a basal level in the absence of inducer, but ArsR would preferentially bind to the operator site, repressingars expression. In vivo repression by ArsR can be fully relieved with 10 μm sodium arsenite (13Shi W. Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19826-19829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while ArsD repression requires approximately 100 μm sodium arsenite for induction (Fig. 1). These results suggest that ArsR has higher affinity for inducer than ArsD. Therefore, a low level of environmental metalloid would cause dissociation of ArsR, resulting in transcription of the ars message and increasing amounts of ArsD. As the intracellular concentration of ArsD exceeded theKd for ars DNA, it would fill thears operator site. Since its affinity for inducer is less than that of ArsR, the relatively low level of inducer present in the cell would not prevent its binding. On the other hand, exposure to high levels of environmental metalloid would cause dissociation of ArsD, effecting further expression of the ars genes and increased synthesis of the Ars extrusion pump. Synthesis of high levels of the pump proteins is itself toxic (4Wu J.H. Rosen B.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 15Wu J. Tisa L.S. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12570-12576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) so that there must be a balance between detoxification of the metalloid and expression of the pump genes. Thus, action of the two repressors forms a homeostatic regulatory circuit that maintains the level of ars expression within a narrow range, with ArsR controlling basal level of expression and ArsD controlling maximal expression (Fig.8). ArsD responds to the same range of inducers as ArsR, with higher affinity for Sb(III) than for As(III), and essentially no response to other heavy metals or metalloids. It is of interest that the R773ars operon encodes three proteins that are regulated by these soft metals; in addition to ArsR and ArsD, the ArsA ATPase is allosterically regulated specifically by binding of Sb(III) or As(III) (16Bhattacharjee H. Li J. Ksenzenko M.Y. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11245-11250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Bhattacharjee H. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24465-24470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These three proteins have no sequence similarity but have apparently evolved independent binding sites for the two soft metals. ArsR has been shown to bind to the R773 ars promoter at the sequence TCATNNNNNNNTTTG, which is just upstream of the −35 site (7Wu J. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 52-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of the DNase I protection show that ArsD and ArsR bind to the same sequence. Thus ArsR and ArsD have also evolved binding sites for the same element on the DNA."

This is unlike fatty acid mobilization from adipocyte triglyceride stores, which is well understood. Both uptake and release of fatty acids by adipocytes is under acute hormonal and neural control and is largely regulated by factors that modulate the activity of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) (12Linscheer W.G.

To gain a better understanding of retinoid mobilization from adipocytes, we have investigated retinyl ester hydrolysis in and retinol efflux from adipocytes. In addition, we have studied in vitro whether HSL can catalyze retinyl ester hydrolysis. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), Coon's F-12/DMEM, penicillin-streptomycin, gentamycin, biotin, pantothenate, and pyruvate were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Insulin, dexamethasone, dibutyryl cAMP, 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, collagenase type IV, collagen type I, and Medium 199 were purchased from Sigma. Fatty acyl chlorides were obtained from Nu-Chek-Prep, Inc. (Elysian, NM). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Intergen Laboratories (Purchase, NY). Guanidinium thiocyanate and β-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Ronkonkoma, NY). Nick translations were performed using a kit purchased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemicals. All radiolabeled nucleotides, [3H]retinol, [14C]triolein, and cholesteryl [14C]oleate were purchased from DuPont NEN Research Products (Boston, MA) and XAR-2 autoradiography film was from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). Authentic all-trans-retinol was a kind gift of Dr. A. Levin of Hofmann LaRoche (Nutley, NJ). BFC-1β preadipocytes cells were kindly provided by Dr. Gerard Ailhaud and Dr. Claude Forest (Nice, France) through Dr. Daryl K. Granner (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) (15Forest C. Doglio A.

Cell Res. 1987; 168: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The BFC-1β preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM containing glucose (1000 mg/liter), penicillin (200 IU/ml), streptomycin (50 mg/ml), pyruvate (110 mg/liter), sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/liter), biotin (8.0 mg/liter), pantothenate (4 mg/liter), 15 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal calf serum (3Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Kong L.W.Y. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13884-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Abumrad N.A. Forest C.C.

Cells were inoculated into 75-cm2 plastic culture flasks and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Confluent BFC-1β preadipocytes were differentiated through exposure to culture medium supplemented with 10−8m insulin and 2 × 10−9m triiodothyronine (differentiation medium) (3Zovich D.C. Orologa A.

A. 1991; 88: 6008-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After induction to differentiate, the BFC-1β cells were continuously maintained in the medium supplemented with insulin and triiodothyronine, with changes in media every 2 or 3 days. The cells used for our studies were taken 27 days after confluence when, as assessed by the presence of intracellular lipid droplets, approximately 80% of the preadipocytes had differentiated into adipocytes. Under these conditions, each flask of differentiated BFC-1β adipocytes contained approximately 3 × 106 cells. We have previously demonstrated that BFC-1β adipocytes will take up retinol from the culture medium and convert greater than 50% of this retinol to retinyl ester (3Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Kong L.W.Y. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13884-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we wished to study retinol mobilization from adipocytes, the BFC-1β adipocytes were preloaded with retinol. For this purpose, differentiation medium was supplemented with 1 μm all-trans-retinol bound to 1% (w/v) fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (BSA). A small aliquot (<100 μl) of a concentrated solution of retinol in ethanol was added to 5 ml of a 1% fatty acid-free BSA solution in PBS (10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride) to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The 0.1 mmretinol-BSA solution was sterilized by passage through a sterile filter and added to 500 ml of the differentiation medium. This gave a concentration of retinol in the differentiation medium of 1 μm. The retinol supplemented medium was placed over the BFC-1β adipocytes 22 days after confluence (5 days before the start of our experiments). Two days later this medium was exchanged for fresh retinol-supplemented medium. The BFC-1β adipocytes remained in this medium until they were taken for study on day 27 after confluence. On the day of study, the medium was removed from over the adipocytes and the adipocytes were washed with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The adipocytes were washed 2 additional times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS to remove residual retinol supplemented medium. Twenty ml of differentiation medium, either supplemented with dibutyryl cAMP or unsupplemented, was then placed over the cells. The dibutyryl cAMP was first dissolved in small volumes of differentiation media, and this was added to appropriate final concentrations directly to the 500 ml of differentiation medium. The adipocytes were returned to the cell culture incubator until taken for analysis. At different time intervals, adipocytes and culture medium were taken for determination of retinol and retinyl ester levels. For this purpose, the culture medium was removed, cells were washed 3 times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plate into 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. The 20 ml of medium and the 10 ml of scraped adipocytes were stored at −70 °C for up to 4 weeks prior to analysis. For measurement at zero time, culture medium was placed over the cells and then immediately removed as described above. Cellular and media levels of retinol and individual retinyl esters were measured by reverse phase HPLC using previously described procedures employed for rat liver retinol and retinyl ester measurements (18Moriwaki H. Blaner W.S. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1523-1534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Authentic standards of retinyl palmitate, retinyl oleate, retinyl stearate, and retinyl linoleate were synthesized from corresponding fatty acyl chlorides using standard procedures (19Bridges C.D.B. Alvarez R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 81: 463-485Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Media and cellular levels of RBP for BFC-1β adipocytes were measured by using a specific radioimmunoassay for rat RBP which has been used previously to quantitate mouse RBP (20Brouwer A. Blaner W.S. Kukler A. van den Berg K.J. Chem.-Biol. Interactions. 1988; 68: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shamada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The rabbit anti-RBP used for these assays does not recognize bovine RBP and thus does not detect the bovine RBP present in adipocyte culture media (20Brouwer A. Blaner W.S. Kukler A. van den Berg K.J. Chem.-Biol. Interactions. 1988; 68: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shamada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S.

The details of this procedure have been described (22Blaner W.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 270-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Free fatty acid levels in the culture medium were analyzed using a kit and the accompanying instructions obtained from Wako Chemicals (Dallas, TX). Total RNA was extracted from the preadipocyte and adipocyte cultures using a modification of the procedure described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). For this purpose, the culture medium was removed from over the cells in the tissue culture flask and 5 ml of a solution containing 4 mguanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1m β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5% Sarcosyl was added directly onto the cells. The resulting cell lysate was collected from the flask and transferred to a Corex tube. Sequentially, 0.5 ml of 2m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 5 ml of TNE saturated phenol, and 1.0 ml of a chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:1) were added to the cell lysate. The lysate was mixed vigorously upon the addition of each of the solutions. The final solution was cooled on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps for RNA isolation were carried out exactly as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Relative levels of RBP and HSL mRNAs were determined by Northern blot analysis. For this purpose, total RNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde, and transferred to nylon membranes. The loads of total RNA applied to each gel were demonstrated to be equal by ethidium bromide staining of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNAs. For all RNA samples, the ratio of intensities of the 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands was approximately 2. These procedures were all carried out according to standard descriptions (24Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1982; Google Scholar). All blots were washed at high stringency in 0.1 × SSC, 1.0% SDS at 65 °C. Specific mRNAs of interest were identified by hybridization with32P-labeled probes prepared by nick translation of cDNA clones (25Soprano D.R. Wyatt M.L. Dixon J.L. Soprano K.J. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2934-2938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled probes were made using a kit supplied by Boehringer Mannheim according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridized membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film at −80 °C. Relative mRNA levels were quantitated by scanning densitometry using a LKB Laser Densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). For hepatocyte isolation, mouse livers were perfused in situ through the portal vein at a rate of 10 ml/min with Kreb's buffer (NaCl, 6.75 g/liter; NaHCO3, 2 g/liter; KCl, 0.345 g/liter; MgSO4, 0.287 g/liter; gentamycin, 10 mg/liter; and glucose, 1 g/liter) for 4 min immediately followed by perfusion for 12 min with Medium 199 (Sigma) containing 0.25 mg/ml collagenase type IV (Sigma) and 10 ng/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). The liver then was rapidly excised from the body cavity and transferred into a Petri dish. The disassociated hepatocytes were resuspended in Medium 199 and centrifuged at 20 × g for 3 min at 25 °C. The resulting cell pellet was washed with DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/liter), sodium pyruvate (100 mg/liter), sodium bicarbonate (3.7 g/liter), penicillin (200 IU/ml)/streptomycin (50 mg/ml), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% fetal calf serum and plated in the same medium on dishes coated with collagen type I (Sigma). This medium was changed after 4 h, after viable hepatocytes had attached to the plate. Plated hepatocytes were used for our studies the morning following isolation. A HSL-containing fraction was isolated from BFC-1β adipocytes according to procedures described by Fredrikson et al. (26Fredrikson G. Strålfors P. Nilsson N.Ö. Belfrage P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6311-6320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At day 27 of differentiation, the culture medium was removed from over the adipocytes from three 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Adipocytes were washed three times in ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plates into a total of 5 ml of 0.25 msucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. The scraped adipocytes were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer and centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The floating fat layer was removed by slicing the centrifuge tube, and the supernatant was filtered through glass wool to remove the remaining fat. The pH of the filtered supernatant was decreased to pH 5.2 by dropwise addition of 0.2 m acetic acid to the supernatant with gentle stirring on a magnetic stir plate. After incubating at pH 5.2 for 20 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 1,000 × g at room temperature. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithioerythritol and stored at −70 °C prior to use. The protein contents of the cells and partially purified HSL fraction were analyzed using the Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent and the accompanying instructions obtained from the Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, IL). CHO cells were grown in Coon's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media containing 1 g/liter glucose (50:50) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (10,000 units/ml), and streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml). The CHO cells were transfected with pCEP4-HSL as described previously (27Sztalryd C. Komaromy M.C. Kraemer F.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2652-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). pCEP4-HSL contains nucleotides 581–2933 of the rat HSL cDNA (a kind gift of Dr. M. Schotz of the University of California, Los Angeles) and encompasses the entire HSL coding region. Transfected cells were selected by hygromycin resistance, and cells overexpressing HSL were subcloned. HSL protein was detected by immunoblotting cell extracts with anti-rat HSL/fusion protein IgG and visualized by chemiluminescence as described previously (28Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Depending on specific experimental needs, HSL activity was measured using three different substrates, triolein, cholesteryl oleate, and retinyl palmitate. For identification and confirmation of CHO cell clones overexpressing HSL, HSL activity was determined using a cholesterol [14C]oleate-containing emulsion as described previously (28Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether HSL catalyzes retinyl ester hydrolysis, CHO cells overexpressing HSL and wild-type CHO cells were cultured to confluence in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. The CHO cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plates into the ice-cold PBS. After pelleting the cells by centrifugation at 20 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin and homogenized using 10 strokes of a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. For assay of HSL, whole CHO cell homogenate containing known amounts of protein was mixed with an emulsion (29Strålfors P. Olsson H Belfrage P. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, London1987: 147-177Google Scholar) containing either [14C]triolein (1.25 mm final in assay concentration) or unlabeled retinyl palmitate (routinely at a final in assay concentration of 1.25 mm) or, to mimic adipocyte concentrations of triolein and retinyl palmitate, as a mixture of [14C]triolein (20 mm final in assay concentration) and unlabeled retinyl palmitate (10 μm final in assay concentration) to a final volume of 0.2 ml. Assays were carried out at 37 °C with gentle shaking for periods of up to 2 h. For determination of an apparentKm of HSL for retinyl palmitate-containing emulsions providing final in assay retinyl palmitate concentrations ranging between 0.01 and 1.25 mm were employed. To terminate reactions employing retinyl palmitate as substrate, 0.2 ml of ice-cold absolute ethanol was added to the tube followed by 2 ml of hexane to extract retinoids. Retinol arising from retinyl palmitate hydrolysis was determined by reverse HPLC analysis of the extracted retinoids employing the HPLC procedures described above. Assays employing triolein as substrate were terminated and quantitated by measure of [14C]oleate formation as described by Strålfors et al. (29Strålfors P. Olsson H Belfrage P. Boyer P.D. Krebs E.G. The Enzymes. Academic Press, London1987: 147-177Google Scholar). The ability of the pH 5.2 precipitate prepared from BFC-1β adipocytes (see above) to catalyze retinyl palmitate hydrolysis was assessed exactly as described above for CHO cell homogenates except that resuspended pH 5.2 precipitate was substituted for CHO cell homogenate. As with the CHO cell homogenates, both [14C]triolein (1.25 mm final in assay concentration) and unlabeled retinyl palmitate (1.25 mm final in assay concentration) were used as substrates in the enzyme assay. Statistically significant changes in response to experimental treatments were determined by Student'st test according to standard procedures (30Snedecor G.W. Cochran W.G. Statistical Methods. Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA1967: 59-61Google Scholar). Since these studies were undertaken to investigate retinol mobilization from adipocytes, we needed first to load the murine BFC-1β adipocytes with retinol. In earlier studies, we showed that when BFC-1β adipocytes are incubated in media containing physiologic levels of retinol, the cultured adipocytes take up and accumulate the retinol (3Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Kong L.W.Y. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13884-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, five days before the start of the experiments, BFC-1β adipocytes were cultured in our standard differentiation medium (described under “Experimental Procedures”) supplemented with 1 μm retinol bound to 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA. (Plasma retinol levels in mice are approximately 1 μm(21Wei S. Episkopou V. Piantedosi R. Maeda S. Shamada K. Gottesman M.E. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 866-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).) The differentiation medium was supplemented with retinol beginning 22 days after the start of induction of adipocyte differentiation, at which point approximately 80% of the cells present in the culture flask were adipocytes (as assessed by the characteristic lipid droplets in the cells). After 5 days of exposure to media containing 1 μm retinol, the BFC-1β adipocytes contained approximately 425 ng of total retinol (retinol + retinyl ester)/106 cells. Tsutsumi et al. (2Tsutsumi C. Okuno M. Tannous L. Piantedosi R. Allan M. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1805-1810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that primary adipocytes freshly isolated from rat epididymal fat pads contain approximately 800 ng of total retinol/106cells. At the start of our studies, approximately 55% of the retinol present in the BFC-1β adipocytes was present as retinyl ester. Retinyl linoleate, retinyl palmitate, and retinyl oleate accounted for over 85% of the total retinyl ester present in the adipocytes. This total retinol level and retinyl ester composition are in agreement with those previously reported for BFC-1β adipocytes provided physiologic levels of retinol in the medium (3Zovich D.C. Orologa A. Okuno M. Kong L.W.Y. Talmage D.A. Piantedosi R. Goodman D.S. Blaner W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13884-13889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, we explored whether dibutyryl cAMP treatment of BFC-1β adipocytes will bring about retinol mobilization from the cells. Since it is known that treatment of cultured adipocytes with hormones or other factors which elevate intracellular cAMP levels stimulates efflux of free fatty acids from the cells, we reasoned that increases in intracellular cAMP concentrations might also stimulate retinol efflux. Cultures of BFC-1β adipocytes, which had been preloaded with retinol, were exposed to the standard differentiation media (unsupplemented with retinol-BSA) containing 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP. At 8, 24, 48, and 72 h after addition of the dibutyryl cAMP supplemented media, the media were taken for determination of retinol, retinyl ester and free fatty acid levels. As seen in Fig. 1, panel A, treatment of the adipocytes with 1 mm dibutyryl cAMP results in a statistically significant elevation of media retinol levels at 24 and 48 h, as compared with unsupplemented adipocyte media. No retinyl ester was present in medium from either dibutyryl cAMP supplemented or unsupplemented adipo"
https://openalex.org/W2058450187,"Abstract CRKL is an SH2-SH3-SH3 adapter protein that is a major substrate of the BCR/ABL oncogene. The function of CRKL in normal cells is unknown. In cells transformed by BCR/ABL we have previously shown that CRKL is associated with two focal adhesion proteins, tensin and paxillin, suggesting that CRKL could be involved in integrin signaling. In two hematopoietic cell lines, MO7e and H9, we found that CRKL rapidly associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after cross-linking of β1 integrins with fibronectin or anti-β1 integrin monoclonal antibodies. The major tyrosine-phosphorylated CRKL-binding protein in the megakaryocytic MO7e cells was identified as p120CBL, the cellular homolog of the v-Cbl oncoprotein. However, in the lymphoid H9 cell line, the major tyrosine-phosphorylated CRKL-binding protein was p110HEF1. In both cases, this binding was mediated by the CRKL SH2 domain. Interestingly, although both MO7e and H9 cells express p120CBLand p110HEF1, β1 integrin cross-linking induces tyrosine phosphorylation of p120CBL (but not p110HEF1) in MO7e cells and of p110HEF1 (but not p120CBL) in H9 cells. In both cell types, CRKL is constitutively complexed to C3G, SOS, and c-ABL through its SH3 domains, and the stoichiometry of these complexes does not change upon integrin ligation. Thus, in different cell types CRKL and its SH3-associated proteins may form different multimeric complexes depending on whether p120CBL or p110HEF1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated after integrin ligation. The shift in association of CRKL and its SH3-associated proteins from p120CBL to p110HEF1 could contribute to different functional outcomes of “outside-in” integrin signaling in different cells."

Wittekindt N. Larson T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6122-6131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Beijer L. Nilsson R.-P. Holmberg C. Rutberg L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Intracellular glycerol is converted to glycerol-3-P by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses ATP as phosphoryl donor (3Lin E.C.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1976; 30: 535-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 4Deutscher J. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 829-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol-3-P is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator (5Sweet G. Gandor C. Voegele R. Wittekindt N. Beuerle J. Truniger V. Lin E.C.C. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 424-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and hence remains entrapped in the cell, where it is further metabolized. Phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase provides the driving force for the uptake of glycerol, as it creates a constant imbalance of the glycerol concentrations inside and outside the cell. It was therefore not surprising that glycerol kinase is the target of several regulation mechanisms.

EIIAGlc of the PTS has been shown to inhibit glycerol kinase activity inEscherichia coli (12de Boer M. Broekhuizen C.P. Postma P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 393-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Salmonella typhimurium(13van der Vlag J. van Dam K. Postma P.W. J.

The phosphorylatable His-90 in EIIAGlc (previously referred to as His-91) (14Dörschug M. Frank R. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Deutscher J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is buried in the center of the interphase in the EIIAGlc-glycerol kinase complex, and phosphorylation at His-90 of EIIAGlc has been proposed to prevent the formation of the complex by electrostatic repulsion (15Hurley J.H. Faber H.R. Worthylake D. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Liao P.-C. Leykam J. Andrews P.C. Gage D.A. Allison J. Anal.

However, in Gram-positive bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis (17Deutscher J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 29: 237-243Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or Bacillus stearothermophilus (18Reizer J. Peterkofsky A. Reizer J. Peterkofsky A. Sugar Transport and Metabolism in Gram-positive Bacteria. Ellis Horwood, Ltd, Chichester, England1987: 333-364Google Scholar), PTS-dependent regulation of glycerol kinase was found to occur by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-dependent phosphorylation at the N-3 position of a histidyl residue (4Deutscher J. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 829-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by the general PTS proteins enzyme I and HPr. Phosphorylation of glycerol kinase, which was found to be reversible,i.e. P-glycerol kinase is able to phosphorylate HPr, increased glycerol kinase activity about 10-fold (4Deutscher J. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 829-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using polyclonal antibodies against glycerol kinase of E. faecalis it has been demonstrated that during growth on glycerol mainly the active, phosphorylated form of glycerol kinase was present in the cells (19Deutscher J. Bauer B. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3730-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, if a rapidly metabolizable PTS substrate was present in the growth medium in addition to glycerol, mainly unphosphorylated, less active glycerol kinase was found in the cells. It was therefore predicted that phosphorylation of glycerol kinase is used to regulate glycerol uptake and metabolism in response to the presence or absence of a PTS substrate in the growth medium (19Deutscher J. Bauer B. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3730-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have cloned and sequenced the glpK genes, which encode glycerol kinase, from Enterococcus casseliflavus andE. faecalis. We found that His-232 of glycerol kinase fromE. casseliflavus is the site of PEP-dependent phosphorylation and that mutations affecting His-232 lead to the loss of phosphorylation and activation of glycerol kinase. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was purchased from 5Prime-3Prime, Inc., or from TEBU, France, and agarose was from FMC Bioproducts. γ-[32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham, France. E. casseliflavus (ATCC 12755) was grown with shaking at 37 °C in M17 medium (20Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose (GM17). Stationary phase E. casseliflavus could retain viability for at least two weeks when maintained at 4 °C in liquid GM17 but only remained viable for one to two days on agar plates. E. faecalis 26487 was maintained and cultured as described previously (19Deutscher J. Bauer B. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3730-3733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene) was grown in LB medium containing 15 g/ml tetracycline and appropriate antibiotics when transformed with plasmids: ampicillin at 50–100 g/ml or chloramphenicol at 50 g/ml. A GAP alignment of the protein sequences for glycerol kinase from E. coli (22Pettigrew D.W. Ma D.-P. Conrad C.A. Johnson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 135-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis (23Holmberg C. Beijer L. Rutberg B. Rutberg L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) indicated that theB. subtilis sequence from Ile-76 to Thr-85 is absolutely conserved between the two species. This consensus sequence was used to design the glk1 primer, using enterococcal codon usage data (24Nakamura Y. Wada K. Wada Y. Doi H. Kanaya S. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 214-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).glk1:5′­ATT GGA ATT ACA AAT CAA CGI GAA AC­3′CTCTCIle­Gly­Ile­Thr­Asn­Gln­Arg­Glu­ThrSCHEME1 The gpo1 (sense) and gpo3 (antisense) oligonucleotide primers were then designed from the α-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) N-terminal and Gpo3 peptide sequences (25Claiborne A. Buckley E. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. Ward D. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA from E. casseliflavus was subjected to amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using eithergpo1 plus gpo3 or glk1 plusgpo3 primer combinations; the 0.9- and 2.4-kb PCR products obtained from these reactions, respectively, were cloned into either pCRII (Invitrogen) or pCR-Script SK(+) (Stratagene). The ends of the inserts were determined by double-stranded sequencing using Sequenase Version 2.0 enzyme (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (21Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The plasmid containing the 2.4-kb glpKO PCR product was used to identify restriction sites within the insert. Chromosomal DNAs were prepared from E. casseliflavus and E. faecalis by the methods of Caparon and Scott (26Caparon M.G. Scott J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 556-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Anderson and McKay (27Anderson D.G. McKay L.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 549-552Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, after overnight growth in GM17. Southern blots were probed with digoxigenin-labeled DNA using a Genius kit from Boehringer Mannheim. A subgenomic E. casseliflavus library was constructed using a size-fractionated (4–5 kb) pool ofHin dIII-digested chromosomal DNA in pWKS30 (28Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar), transformed into competent XL1-Blue cells (29Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Colonies were screened by hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled probe of the 2.4-kbglpKO PCR product and the 1.1-kb Cla I fragment. Possible positive clones were confirmed by restriction digests and by PCR analysis of plasmid DNA. A 3.5-kbHin dIII/Pst I fragment from the E. casseliflavus glpK clone pGLP06 was subcloned into the plasmid pMOB, to allow sequencing using the TN1000 transposon system (30Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Palazzolo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Isolates were chosen which had transposon insertions at approximately 200-bp intervals. Specific oligonucleotides were used to clarify any regions of sequence ambiguity or in cases where only one DNA strand had been sequenced. Overall, the entire glpK locus as contained within the pMOB subclone (pGLP07) was sequenced on both strands. Contig assembly, GAP alignments, and data base searches were carried out using the GCG suite of DNA analysis programs (31Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). The glpK gene from E. faecalis 26487 was cloned using a similar subgenomic approach. A Southern blot of E. faecalis genomic DNA was probed with a digoxigenin-labeled DNA fragment containing the entire E. casseliflavus glpK gene, to identify a 1.6-kb Eco RI/Bam HI fragment for cloning. Sequence analysis of this Eco RI/Bam HI clone in pMOB (pGLP12) indicated that it lacked approximately 150–180 bp corresponding to the 5′-end of the gene. Genomic Southern combined with the partial sequence available indicated that a 0.7–0.8-kbDra I fragment would complete the glpK coding sequence. A pool of appropriately sized Dra I fragments, generated by digestion of chromosomal DNA, was circularized with T4 DNA ligase. This circularized DNA was then used as the template to PCR amplify the 5′-end of the glpK gene using two divergent primers designed from the known sequence of pGLP12. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pT7-Blue (Novagen). Three clones were isolated and gave identical sequences as determined in automated analyses performed by the DNA Sequencing and Gene Analysis Facility, Wake Forest University Medical Center. The E. casseliflavus glpK structural gene (Eco47III/Pst I fragment) was subcloned into pBluescript, and the H232A, H232E, and H232R mutants were generated in this plasmid using the Sculptor mutagenesis kit (Amersham Corp.). The pGLPK02 expression plasmid for wild-type glpK was constructed by subcloning the 2-kbEco47III/Pst I fragment containing the structural gene and ribosome-binding site into the T7 expression vector pOXO4 (32Parsonage D. Miller H. Ross R.P. Claiborne A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3161-3167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cut with Xho I (made blunt end) and Pst I. The recombinant glycerol kinase was expressed in E. coli JM109DE3 by growing cells in Luria Bertani medium containing 30 g/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C until they had reached anA595 of about 1. IPTG was subsequently added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm and cells were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The mutant proteins were expressed following the protocol developed for the wild-type enzyme. To create an expression vector for E. faecalis glpK, the 5′-end of the gene was PCR-amplified using a primer derived from theglpK sequence downstream of the internal Eco RI site and primer EFGKRBS, which includes a Xho I site immediately upstream of the glpK ribosome-binding site: CGGCTCGAG GAGGAATTATCATGGCAGAAG (theXho I site is in italics and the initiation codon ofglpK is underlined). The resulting 237-bp PCR product was digested with Xho I and Eco RI and ligated into the pGLP12 clone digested with the same restriction enzymes. The completeE. faecalis glpK gene with its ribosome-binding site was excised by digestion with Xho I and Bam HI and ligated into pOXO4 to generate the plasmid pEFGLPK3. The PCR-generated fragment of glpK was sequenced to confirm the subcloning. This plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21DE3 for expression of the E. faecalis glycerol kinase after induction with IPTG, which gave better results than the strain JM109DE3 that we used for expression of glpK from E. casseliflavus. Cells were harvested by centrifugation after induction with IPTG and washed with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8, before they were resuspended in the same buffer containing 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 240 units/ml of benzonuclease (Merck). Cells were subsequently disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell at 15,000 p.s.i. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded on a DEAE column (Whatman DE-52, 2.6 × 7 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in this buffer. Glycerol kinase of E. casseliflavus and E. faecalis eluted at around 0.6 m NaCl. Glycerol kinase containing fractions were pooled, concentrated and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, containing 1 mm EDTA (disodium salt) and 1 mm dithiothreitol by using Vivaspin vials (Vivascience, France). The concentrated glycerol kinase solution was subsequently loaded on a Q Sepharose (Fast Flow) column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in the above buffer. Glycerol kinase eluted as a single peak and was more than 90% pure. The glycerol kinase pool was desalted after chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C. Glycerol kinase activity was determined by using a coupled spectrophotometric assay carried out in 100 mm glycine/hydrazine buffer, pH 8.8, as described in Deutscher and Sauerwald (4Deutscher J. Sauerwald H. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 166: 829-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the effect of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate or EIIAGlc from E. coli or B. subtilis on glycerol kinase activity, these compounds were included in the reaction mixture at the indicated concentrations. EIIAGlc was purified from E. coli as described in Dörschug et al. (14Dörschug M. Frank R. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Deutscher J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 144: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the B. subtilis EIIAGlc domain was prepared as described in Reizer et al. (33Reizer J. Sutrina S.L. Wu L.-F. Deutscher J. Reddy P. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9158-9169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the effect of phosphorylation on glycerol kinase activity, glycerol kinase (2.5 g) was incubated with PEP, MgCl2, enzyme I (0.5 g), and HPr (1 g) and after 20 min incubation at 37 °C, one-fifth of the reaction mixture was used for the glycerol kinase assay, the remaining four-fifths were loaded on a denaturing 7.5% polyacrylamide gel (PAG) to determine the degree of phosphorylation of glycerol kinase. To determine the site of phosphorylation in glycerol kinase, the enzyme isolated from E. casseliflavus was phosphorylated using enzyme I and HPr fromB. subtilis. Both PTS proteins were synthesized with a His tag attached to the N terminus (34Charrier V. Deutscher J. Galinier A. Martin-Verstraete I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This allowed a rapid, one-step purification of the two general PTS proteins. Glycerol kinase (75 g) was incubated with enzyme I (10 g) and HPr (5 g) in 90 l of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 10 mmMgCl2 and 5 mm PEP at 37 °C for 20 min. After incubation, most of the enzyme I and HPr was removed by adding a small amount of Ni-NTA resin to the incubation mixture which was subsequently removed by centrifugation. A 3-l aliquot was taken from the assay mixture and loaded on a denaturing 7.5% PAG to determine the approximate degree of phosphorylation of glycerol kinase. Trypsin (3 g) was subsequently added to the P-glycerol kinase preparation which was incubated for a further 3 h at 37 °C. Tryptic peptides of glycerol kinase were obtained by incubating glycerol kinase with enzyme I and HPr in the absence of PEP, but using otherwise the same procedure described for P-glycerol kinase. The tryptic peptides of glycerol kinase and P-glycerol kinase were subsequently analyzed by mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation of wild-type glycerol kinase or of the mutant derivatives for analytical purposes or with [32P]PEP was carried out by incubating 3 g of glycerol kinase for 20 min at 37 °C with 0.5 g of enzyme I fromStaphylococcus carnosus or B. subtilis and 1 g of HPr (B. subtilis) in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer containing 10 mm MgCl2 and either 10 mm PEP or 0.5 m [32P]PEP (0.1 Ci) in a total volume of 20 l. [32P]PEP was prepared from γ-[32P]ATP as described in Roosienet al. (35Roosien F.F. Brink J. Robillard G.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 760: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed using a SCIEX API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Sciex Instruments, Thornhill, Canada) equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray (ionspray) source. Liquid chromatography was directly coupled to ESI-MS using a 140B syringe pump system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Tryptic digests of glycerol kinase or P-glycerol kinase were loaded onto a Brownlee reverse phase C18 column (5 m, 1 mm x 100 mm, Applied Biosystems) run with a flow rate of 50 l/min. Using a Valco T, a split of 1/3 was applied such that approximately 15 l/min was directed to the mass spectrometer. The remaining effluent was diverted to an Applied Biosystems 785 UV detector monitoring at 214 nm. Peptide separation was achieved using a linear gradient of 0–100% acetonitrile (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with a slope of 1%/min. Mass spectra (m/z 400–1400) were acquired with a 2-ms dwell time per step of 0.9 Da. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra (MALDI-MS) of peptides derived from glycerol kinase or P-glycerol kinase were recorded on a RETOF (time of flight) instrument from Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA). A solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in 70% acetonitrile was used as a matrix. A 1-l aliquot of the tryptic peptide mixture, containing 15 pmol of digested protein, was mixed with 1 l of the matrix solution, and half of it was deposited on the target and dried. Spectra were recorded from 128 laser shots (nitrogen laser, 337 nm) with an accelerating voltage of 20,000 V in a linear mode with a 50-ns pulsed source delay extraction. The instrument was calibrated using human insulin and horse hemoglobin as standards. The glpK gene in B. subtilis precedes the glpD locus encoding the FAD-dependent α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (23Holmberg C. Beijer L. Rutberg B. Rutberg L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and sequence analyses of four peptides (including Gpo3) isolated from theE. casseliflavus α-glycerophosphate oxidase (GlpO) indicated identities of 47–62% with corresponding segments of theB. subtilis GlpD (25Claiborne A. Buckley E. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. Ward D. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar). To test for the possible linkage of the glpK and glpO loci in E. casseliflavus, an oligonucleotide primer (glk1) was designed based on a GAP alignment of the B. subtilis (23Holmberg C. Beijer L. Rutberg B. Rutberg L. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and E. coli (22Pettigrew D.W. Ma D.-P. Conrad C.A. Johnson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 135-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) glycerol kinase sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). PCR reactions using the glk1 and gpo3 primers with E. casseliflavus DNA resulted in amplification of a 2.4-kb product. Partial sequence analysis after subcloning into pCR-Script confirmed the presence of both glpK and glpO coding sequences, and the size of the product is consistent with that predicted from the B. subtilis glpKD sequence and the peptide alignments corresponding to glk1 and gpo3. This glpKO PCR product was also mapped in pCR-Script with a series of restriction digests (25Claiborne A. Buckley E. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. Ward D. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar); both the 1.1-kb Cla I fragment corresponding toglpK and the 2.4-kb PCR product were used as probes in theglpK cloning described. Based on the results of Southern analyses, genomic DNA was digested with Hin dIII, and fragments of 4–5 kb were used to generate a subgenomic library in the low copy number plasmid pWKS30 (28Wang R.F. Kushner S.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). XL-1 Blue transformants were screened by hybridization with theglpKO probe. From approximately 120 recombinant colonies screened, a single positive clone (containing plasmid pGLP06) was isolated. The identity of the insert of pGLP06 with part of theE. casseliflavus glp operon was confirmed by restriction analysis based on the known Pst I and Kpn I sites (25Claiborne A. Buckley E. Parsonage D. Ross R.P. Ward D. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1995; 85: 129-133PubMed Google Scholar) and by PCR analysis with both glk and gpo primers. The 3.5 kbHin dIII/Pst I fragment of the pGLP06 insert was subcloned into the pMOB vector for transposon-facilitated sequencing (30Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Palazzolo M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and complete nucleotide sequence data were obtained on both strands. The composite sequence includes 3511 bp that account for the entire glpK coding sequence (1521 bp) as well as a partial open reading frame of 467 bp following glpK, which corresponds to the 5′-end of the glpO gene encoding α-glycerophosphate oxidase. An intergenic region of only 3 bp separates the glpK stop codon from the glpO start codon; the glpK ribosome-binding site (AGGGAG) is identified 14 bp upstream of the initiation codon. The E. faecalis glpK gene was sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” On the basis of the N-terminal protein sequence for the E. faecalis 26487 glycerol kinase (AEEKYIMAIDQGTTSSRA) 3H. E. Meyer and J. Deutscher, unpublished results. the ATG codon corresponding to the start codon was recognized immediately, although the initiating Met is removed post-translationally in the E. faecalis enzyme. The E. faecalis glpK encodes a polypeptide of 501 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 55,445 (including Met-1), similar to the value of 55 kDa reported previously for the purified E. faecalis glycerol kinase (17Deutscher J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 29: 237-243Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2057939121,"A G-protein βγ subunit (Gβγ)-responsive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) was purified approximately 5000-fold from pig platelet cytosol. The enzyme was purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation of the cytosol followed by column chromatography on Q-Sepharose fast flow, gel filtration, heparin-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite. The major Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase is distinct from p85 containing PI 3-kinase as the activities can be distinguished chromatographically and immunologically and is related to p110γ as it cross-reacts with anti-p110γ-specific antibodies. The p110γ-related PI 3-kinase cannot be activated by G-protein αi/o subunits, and it has an apparent native molecular mass of 210 kDa. The p110γ-related PI 3-kinase phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2). The apparent Km values for ATP were found to be 25 μm with PtdIns, 44 μm with PtdIns4P, and 37 μm with PtdIns(4,5)P2 as the substrate. Gβγ subunits did not alter the Km of the enzyme for ATP; however,Vmax increased 2-fold with PtdIns as substrate, 3.5-fold with PtdIns4P, and 10-fold with PtdIns(4,5)P2. Under basal conditions the apparent Km values for lipid substrates were 64, 10, and 15 μm for PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively. In the presence of Gβγ subunits the dependence of PI 3-kinase activity on the concentrations of lipid substrates became complex with the highest level of stimulation occurring at high substrate concentration, suggesting that the binding of Gβγ and lipid substrate (particularly PtdIns(4,5)P2) may be mutually cooperative. Wortmannin and LY294002 inhibit the Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase activity with IC50 values of 10 nm and 2 μm, respectively. Unlike the p85 containing PI 3-kinase in platelets, the p110γ-related PI 3-kinase is not associated with a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 specific 5-phosphatase.The p85-associated PI 3-kinase was not activated by Gβγ alone but could be synergistically activated by Gβγ and phosphotyrosyl platelet-derived growth factor receptor peptides.

This enzyme is immunologically and biochemically distinct from a growth factor-regulated, p85-containing PI 3-kinase present in the same cells. Using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved regions of known PI kinases, Stoyanov et al. (23Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S.

Recombinant p110γ has a predicted molecular mass of 120 kDa and can be activated in vitro by both Gβγ and the α subunits of transducin and Gi. p110γ differs from the α and β isoforms mainly by its lack of the recognized p85 binding site which is replaced by a region which has been proposed to resemble a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (23Stoyanov B. Volinia S. Hanck T. Rubio I. Loubtchenkov M. Malek D. Stoyanova S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Dhand R. Nurnburg B. Gierschik P. Seedorf K. Hsuan J. Waterfield M.D. Wetzker R.

Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because this activity associated with a PDGF receptor phosphotyrosyl peptide and was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody raised against the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, it was thought to possess a p85-related subunit. However, Zhang et al. (25Zhang J. Zhang J. Benovic J.L. Sugai M. Wetzker R. Gout I. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

The latter study established that this platelet Gβγ-stimulated enzyme was immunologically related to p110γ. The substrate specificities of identified PI 3-kinases vary substantially (11Otsu M.

To define the molecular characteristics and properties of Gβγ-stimulated PI 3-kinases in platelets more clearly, we have now partially purified the major form of this enzyme from pig platelets. This enzyme is a p110γ-related PI 3-kinase that is distinct from p85-associated species and that phosphorylates all three potential phosphoinositide substrates with a marked preference for PtdIns(4,5)P2 which is further enhanced by Gβγ. As the results appeared to contradict previous detection of a Gβγ-responsive p85-containing PI 3-kinase in human platelets (24Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also studied the p85-containing PI 3-kinase in pig platelets. We found that this enzyme can be activated by Gβγ in a manner that is largely dependent upon the presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF receptor peptide. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, PtdIns, phosphatidyl-l-serine, and protein G-Sepharose were purchased from Sigma; PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were prepared as described (38James S.R. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol) and enhanced chemiluminescence were purchased from Amersham Corp. Partisphere SAX high performance liquid chromatography columns were from Whatman; Superose 12 HR 10/30, Mono Q, Q-Sepharose fast flow, heparin-Sepharose CL-6B and PD-10 column were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Centricon-30 was from Amicon. GTPγS was from Boehringer Mannheim; mouse monoclonal antibodies to PI 3-kinase p85 were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Genapol C-100 detergent was from CAlbiochem; Gαi/owas kindly provided by Dr. P. Casey (Duke University, North Carolina). Phosphotyrosyl peptide based on the sequence of PDGF receptor was provided by Dr. S. Cartlidge, Zenaca Pharmaceutical. p110γ anti-peptide antibodies were provided by Dr. R. Wetzker (Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena). The major G-protein βγ subunits were purified from cholate extracts of bovine brain membranes as described by Sternweis and Robishaw (39Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Gβγ subunits were stored in 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Genaple C-100 and were more than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE. The Gβγ preparation was flash-frozen in 10-μl aliquots and stored at −80 °C until use. Platelet cytosol was derived from 12 liters of freshly drawn pig blood. The detailed procedure for preparation of platelet cytosol was essentially the same as described (24Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were sonicated in 120 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3 mmMgCl2, 10 mg/ml each of antipain and pepstatin, 1 mm each of DTT, sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine). The platelet lysate was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 1 h, and the resulting supernatant (platelet cytosol, 1049 mg of protein) was kept. Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase was precipitated by 5–15% PEG in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml each of antipain and pepstatin, 1 mm each of DTT, sodium orthovanadate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine). The pellet was resuspended in 36 ml of buffer A. The PEG sample (36 mg) was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (150 × 15 mm), pre-equilibrated with buffer A, and eluted with a gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl (150 ml). Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase fractions (12 mg) were pooled and loaded onto a gel filtration column (Sepharose CL-4B, 100 × 2.6 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B (buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl and 10% sucrose). The Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase activity fractions (1.35 mg protein) were pooled and loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column (50 × 10 mm) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer B and eluted with a linear gradient of 100–500 mm NaCl (60 ml). Fractions (0.36 mg) containing Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase were pooled and concentrated to 6 ml with Prepcentricon 30 (Amicon, Inc. Beverly, MA). Half of the sample was loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (100 × 10) pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0, 5 mmDTT, 0.1 mm each of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and benzamidine); protein was eluted with 20–750 mmK2HPO4 during which the Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase was separated from the tyrosine kinase-regulated PI 3-kinase. Separation of the Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase from the tyrosine kinase-regulated PI 3-kinase can also be achieved by incubating half of the concentrated enzyme with 2 ml of protein G-Sepharose pre-coupled with anti-p85 antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase prepared by either method did not contain any p85 protein nor any other detectable lipid kinase activity. Generally the enzyme activity was measured by adopting the following assay procedure. 10 μl of platelet cytosol or column fractions were mixed with 30 μl of lipid vesicles, which had been premixed with Gβγ or their vehicle for 10 min on ice. 10 μl of MgATP was added to start the reaction. The enzyme reaction was terminated after incubating at 37 °C for 5 min by adding 200 μl of 1 m HCl. To prepare lipid vesicles, equimolar amounts of PS and substrate lipid (PtdIns, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2) were dried onto a film under vacuum and probe-sonicated (3 × 15 s with 1 min on ice between sonication, at setting 20–30 on a Jencons Ultrasonic Processor) into kinase assay buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mmMgCl2). The standard assay contained 100 μmPtdIns(4,5)P2 and PS, 10–100 μm ATP (10 μm with purified fraction and 100 μm with crude extract), 1 μm Gβγ or its vehicles and 10 μCi of [γ32P]ATP. Lipid extraction and analysis was performed as described (24Thomason P.A. James S.R. Casey P.J. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16525-16528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The products of the PI 3-kinase reactions were identified by deacylation and separation of their glycerol derivatives by high performance liquid chromatography and compared with deacylated 3H-labeled standards. Note that assays were done under first order conditions with respect to ATP as substrate (to optimize assay of radioactive product) ensuring that no more than 10% of ATP was consumed during a reaction. For assays requiring activated Gα-proteins, Gα-proteins were incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of 100 μmGTPγS and 5 mm MgCl2, mixed with PtdIns-containing lipid vesicles, and incubated again for 10 min on ice, before adding to the assay. Samples of column eluate (for detection of p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase) or purified Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase (for p110γ) were mixed with 4 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE with 7.5% acrylamide in the separating gel. Proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a dry-blotting device (Bio-Rad). Western blots were performed as described (22Stephens L. Smrcka A. Cooke F.T. Jackson T.R. Sternweis P.C. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1994; 77: 83-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) using either anti-p85 antibody (1:1000 dilution) or p110γ antibodies (1:200) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution). Blots were then developed using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. A Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase was purified approximately 5000-fold, with an overall yield of 30%, from porcine platelet cytosol using PEG precipitation, Q-Sepharose, gel filtration, heparin-Sepharose, and hydroxyapatite. A typical purification is summarized in Table I. PEG precipitation resulted in a 30-fold enrichment with 100% recovery of Gβγ-responsive activity. Elution of this sample from Q-Sepharose using a continuous salt gradient revealed two distinct peaks of Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase (Fig. 1 A). The earlier eluting, minor peak of activity was inconsistently observed in a number of purifications from different batches of platelets and was not studied further. Analysis of fractions eluting from the Q-Sepharose column by Western blotting with an anti-p85 monoclonal antibody revealed that the second peak of Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase co-eluted with p85 immunoreactivity (Fig. 1 B). p85 and Gβγ-responsive activity continued to co-migrate through gel filtration and heparin-Sepharose (data not shown). However, separation of p85 and the Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase was achieved through hydroxyapatite eluted with a linear gradient of K2HPO4/KH2PO4 as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Separation could also be achieved by immunodepletion of p85 using protein G-Sepharose that had been pre-coupled with anti-p85 antibodies (Fig.3 A). The Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase is related to p110γ as it can be recognized by an anti-p110γ anti-peptide antibody (Fig. 3 B).Table IPurification of Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinaseStepTotal Gβγ stimulatable activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationnmol PIP3 · min−1mgnmol PIP3 · mg−1 · min−1-foldCrude platelet cytosol4.5010490.0042100PHG 80004.60360.1310230Q-Sepharose3.83120.328576Gel filtration3.601.352.6780635Heparin-Sepharose3.020.368.40672000Hydroxyapatite1.350.0621.00305000The purification began with 1049 mg of platelet cytosol protein from 12 liters of blood.

Columns were run as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The Gβγ-stimulatable PI 3-kinase activity was defined as the activity in the presence of Gβγ minus that in the absence of Gβγ in the assay and is expressed as nmol of PtdInsP3 formed per min. The native molecular mass of the Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase was determined using a calibrated Superose 12 size exclusion column. As shown in Fig.4, the activity eluted at a volume indicating a size of approximately 210 kDa. The enzyme was not pure at that stage as revealed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of active fractions (not shown). This indicated that the enzyme is a very minor protein in platelet cytosol. The substrate specificity and kinetic characteristics of the enzyme were consistent between several different preparations. As the enzyme after hydroxyapatite cannot survive freezing and thawing, activity purified through heparin-Sepharose and immunodepleted to remove p85 was used for most experiments. Such preparations were purified approximately 2000-fold with respect to platelet cytosol and contained no detectable PtdIns 4-kinase, PtdIns4P 5-kinase, or PLC (EC 3.1.4.3) activities. PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 were all phosphorylated at the 3-position (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the phosphorylations of PtdIns and PtdIns4P were inhibited by the presence of PtdIns(4, 5)P2 as described previously (29Abrams C.S.

Anti-p85 and anti-p110 antibodies were recently shown to co-immunoprecipitate with a PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-specific 5-phosphatase which was presumed to be present in a complex with this form of PI 3-kinase (30Jackson S.P.

Analysis of the partially purified Gβγ-sensitive PI 3-kinase using32P-labeled PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as substrate or by monitoring the ratio of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/PtdIns(3,4)P2 in PI 3-kinase assays failed to detect any 5-phosphatase in such preparations (data not shown). Km values were determined under basal conditions for ATP and all three lipid substrates. Similar Kmvalues for ATP of 25, 44, and 37 μm were determined when PtdIns, PtdIns4P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively, were used as substrates (Fig. 5 A and Fig.6 A). Km values for the lipid substrates were determined using 10 μm ATP and maintaining a constant mole fraction of 1:1 (substrate/PS). 10 μm ATP (i.e. somewhat less than theKm value) was used to estimate the sensitivity of the assays. However, since less than 5% ATP was consumed during incubation, the assays were linear under the conditions determined. The reactions approximated to Michaelis-Menten kinetics withKm values of 64, 10, and 15 μm for PtdIns, PtdIns4P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively (Fig.5 B and Fig. 6 B). Similar values were obtained using either Lineweaver-Burk or Wolfe plots.Figure 6Double-reciprocal plots of kinetic data of Gβγ-responsive PI 3-kinase in the absence of Gβγ.

https://openalex.org/W2088576817,"Two β-galactoside-binding proteins were found to be prominently expressed in the human colon adenocarcinoma T84 cell line. Cloning and sequencing of one, a 36-kDa protein, identified it as the human homolog of galectin-4, a protein containing two carbohydrate binding domains and previously found only in the epithelial cells of the rat and porcine alimentary tract. The other, a 29-kDa protein, is galectin-3, containing a single carbohydrate binding domain, previously found in a number of different cell types including human intestinal epithelium. Despite the marked similarities in the carbohydrate binding domains of these two galectins, their cellular distribution patterns are strikingly different and vary with cellular conditions. In confluent T84 cells, galectin-4 is mostly cytosolic and concentrated at the basal membrane, whereas galectin-3 tends to be concentrated in large granular inclusions mostly at the apical membrane. In subconfluent T84 cells, each galectin is distributed to specific domains of lamellipodia, with galectin-4 concentrated in the leading edge and galectin-3 more proximally. Such different localization of galectins-4 and -3 within T84 cells implies different targeting mechanisms, ligands, and functions. The localization of galectin-4 suggests a role in cell adhesion which is also supported by the ability of immobilized recombinant galectin-4 to stimulate adhesion of T84 cells.

The localization of galectin-4 suggests a role in cell adhesion which is also supported by the ability of immobilized recombinant galectin-4 to stimulate adhesion of T84 cells. Galectins are a family of animal lectins defined by affinity for β-galactoside-containing saccharides and by shared sequence elements (for review, see Ref. 1Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.W.

Previous work has shown that galectin-4 and galectin-3 are both present at high concentration in intestinal extracts (2Leffler H. Masiarz F.R. Barondes S.H.

Galectin-4 has only been found in the epithelium of the alimentary tract, including oral mucosa (5Chiu M.L Jones J.C. O'Keefe E.J. J.

Although galectins are cytosolic proteins lacking signal sequences, galectins-1 and -3 are known to be externalized by nonclassical secretory mechanisms (9Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. J.

Galectin-1 and galectin-3 have been shown to bind extracellular matrix components (13Woo H.-J. Shaw L.M. Messier M.M. Mercurio J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7097-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Yamamoto Y. Funahashi M. Hamako J. Titani K.

Hence, it is plausible that galectin-4 is also involved in cell adhesion by interacting with extracellular glycoconjugates. No specific ligands for galectin-4 have been identified so far, but its interaction with an adherens junction component in oral mucosa has been indicated (5Chiu M.L Jones J.C. O'Keefe E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As a step in determining the function of galectin-4, we have examined its localization in the human colonic adenocarcinoma T84 cell line frequently used as a model of intestinal crypt epithelium (17Dharmsathaphorn K.

We found that despite the marked similarities in the carbohydrate binding domains of these two galectins, their distribution patterns in the same cells are strikingly different, with galectin-4 localized mainly at sites of cell adhesion.

Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, Vectastain kit, and Vectashield were from Vector (South San Francisco, CA). T84 cells (passages 54–70) were grown following the procedure of Dharmsathaphorn et al. (22Dharmsathaphorn K. McRoberts J.A. Mandel K.G. Tisdale L.D. Masui H. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G204-G208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's H-16/F-12 medium (1:1) containing 5% newborn calf serum, 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 17.5 mm glucose, and 2.5 mm glutamine, in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C (seeding density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2). For immunocytochemistry, the cells were grown on uncoated glass coverslips. For labeling in vivo with [35S]methionine/cysteine, T84 cells were grown on 10-cm-diameter plastic dishes as described above. Endogenous methionine/cysteine was depleted before labeling by washing cells with methionine-free minimal essential medium and incubating in depletion medium (methionine-free minimal essential medium, 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) for 1 h at 37 °C. For labeling, the medium was replaced with 5 ml of the same medium containing 1 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine. After 12 h at 37 °C the cells were washed extensively, first in prewarmed, then in ice-cold PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PLP, paraformaldehyde-periodate-lysine; BSA, bovine serum albumin. (5.4 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and lysed in 1.5 ml/plate of ice-cold lysis buffer: 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS, containing protease inhibitors (3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for purification of galectins by affinity chromatography. The supernatant of the cell lysate was passed over a lactosyl-Sepharose column (prepared as described by Leffler et al. (2Leffler H. Masiarz F.R. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9222-9229Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)) equilibrated with the lysis buffer without protease inhibitors. Unbound material was washed off the column with buffer containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Lectin was eluted with buffer containing 150 mm lactose, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Galectin-3 was immunoprecipitated from both T84 cell lysate or from galectin-containing fractions eluted from lactosyl-Sepharose using anti-galectin-3 and protein G-Sepharose as described (20Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All samples were precleared twice with Sepharose CL-2B before the addition of the primary antibody. The washed precipitates were boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Proteins were localized by Coomassie Blue staining followed by fluorography at −70 °C with Kodak XAR-5 film and intensifying screens. Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the MiniProtean unit (Bio-Rad) was used under standard conditions. The ratio of galectin-3 to galectin-4 was estimated by densitometric scanning. Unless specified otherwise, all manipulations of nucleic acids such as restriction, ligation, transformation, gel electrophoresis, blotting, gel elution, radiolabeling, and preparation of buffers were done using standard protocols (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor, NY. 1989; Google Scholar). Samples were sequenced using Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The reported sequence was confirmed on both strands. Human genomic DNA was amplified with convergent oligonucleotide primer pairs complementary to several different parts of the rat galectin-4 gene (3Oda Y. Hermann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), by PCR using 1 μg of human genomic DNA (CLONTECH)/50-μl reaction. Reactions were carried out under conditions described by Gitt et al. (24Gitt M.A. Wiser M.F. Leffler H. Herrmann J. Xia Y.-R. Massa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Lusis A.J. Barondes S.H. J. Biol.

PCR using primers 5′-CTGCCATGGCGGGACCCCCGATCTTCAA-3′ and 5′-ATGATGGTTCTTCGGGCTG-3′ yielded a major product that was cloned into the pCR1000 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This product was a gene fragment containing an intron flanked by two exon fragments. A human gene-specific antisense primer (HL36A, 5′-TGAGCCCTCCTTGCAGCC-3′) was designed based on one of the exon sequences, to be used in PCR of reverse transcribed RNA. Total RNA was isolated from confluent T84 cells using RNazol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was reverse transcribed, using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, with the C35 primer 5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′, which is designed to hybridize with poly(A) and to provide an anchor sequence for use in subsequent PCR. The 20-μl solution was then diluted to 1 ml with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 μl of this diluted solution was used in PCR with the antisense primer HL36A described above, and a sense primer (Ω1, 5′-TTCTATGAATACGGGCACCGG-3′) designed based on further upstream sequence of rat galectin-4. The PCR conditions were: 5 cycles of annealing at 50 °C for 1 min and 40 cycles of annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C was for 2 min in all cycles. One pure band was obtained, cloned into pCR1000, and sequenced using vector-specific primers. Based on this sequence, a sense human-specific primer, HL36B, 5′-TACCCTGGTCCCGGACATTG-3′, was synthesized, and PCR was performed with primers HL36B and C19 (a primer containing the anchor sequence (non-oligo(dT)) of primer C35) and cDNA as template. Annealing was at 56 °C for 1 min, and polymerization was at 72 °C for 1.5 min. A single band was obtained and ligated into pCR1000, yielding a clone that was used as a probe to screen a λZAP-II cDNA library prepared from T84 cells (a generous gift from Dr. J. R. Riordan, Sick Children's Hospital, Toronto). Positive clones were purified by rescreening. One positive clone was found to contain all previously identified sequence and additional 5′ sequence. Subsequently a galectin-4 cDNA clone, isolated as an expressed sequence tag (25Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) from a T84 cell cDNA library (I.M.A.G.E. consortium; clone ID 509819), was obtained (in the Bluescript SK− vector) from Genome Systems Inc. (St. Louis). Sequencing of this clone confirmed the identity with our previously obtained galectin-4 sequences and provided additional 5′ sequence to complete the galectin-4 coding sequence. Cells grown on uncoated coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed either with 4% paraformaldehyde-periodate-lysine (PLP) (26Brown W.J. Farquhar M.G. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 31: 553-569Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar), or with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 h at room temperature, and washed repeatedly with PBS. The cells were permeabilized with 0.025% saponin in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by incubation of fixed cells in PBS containing 6.6 mg/ml fish skin gelatin (Sigma), and cells were incubated with primary antibody in PBS-fish skin gelatin for 1 h at room temperature, washed for 10 min three times in PBS-fish skin gelatin, incubated with fluorochrome- or biotin-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS-fish skin gelatin for 30 min, washed, and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated second fluorochrome in PBS for 30 min. Samples were then washed thoroughly in PBS, and after a final rinse in double distilled H2O mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed in a laser scanning confocal module (Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal head attached to a Nikon Optiphot microscope) with a × 63 1.4 N.A. objective, 0.5 s/scan with 12 frames/image, Kalman filter, and 1 μm/step for XY sections; 0.3 μm/step was used for XZ sections. To remove extracellular Ca2+, the cells were incubated in growth medium containing 4 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C (27Kartenbeck J. Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), rinsed with Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS, fixed, and processed as above. Escherichia coli producing full-length rat galectin-4 was generated using the pET system (Novagen, Madison, WI) as described by Oda et al. (3Oda Y. Hermann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The culture, extraction, and lectin purification were also done as described (3Oda Y. Hermann J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W. Burlingame A.L. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5929-5939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except for induction at lower temperature and French press lysis to circumvent the insolubility of the galectin-4. In brief, 1 liter of Luria broth with 50 mg of ampicillin was inoculated with a 15-ml overnight culture of the galectin-4-expressing E. coli, and then shaken for 3 h at 37 °C. The temperature was lowered to 30 °C, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (100 mg) added, and the incubation continued for another 3 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was either frozen or processed immediately. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 15 ml of PBS containing 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm EDTA (ME-PBS), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice and lysed three times with a French press, the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The galectin was purified from the clear supernatant by affinity chromatography on lactosyl-Sepharose. The yield of active soluble galectin-4 was about 20 mg per liter of bacterial culture. The galectin was stored at 4 °C in ME-PBS containing 150 mm lactose. Before use, an aliquot was chromatographed on a Superdex 75HR column (Pharmacia) in ME-PBS to remove lactose. Adhesion of T84 cells to coated wells was examined by procedures described in detail by McClay et al. (28McClay D.R. Wessel G.M. Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Every other eight-well row in the flexible microtiter assay plate (MicroTest III, Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) was treated with solutions of laminin (5 μg/cm2), BSA (2%) or rat recombinant galectin-4 (5 μg/cm2) in PBS. After the addition of 50 μl to the wells, the plates were covered with Saran Wrap and incubated for 12 h at room temperature. Coated wells were washed for 10 min three times with PBS, and nonspecific adhesion sites were blocked by incubation with 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min washes with PBS. Subconfluent T84 cell cultures were labeled with 10 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine as above, rinsed quickly with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS, and gently dissociated to single cells and small cell clusters by incubation for 1 min at 37 °C with 0.05% trypsin solution containing 0.02% EDTA, prewarmed to 37 °C. The cells were rinsed once in the growth medium and resuspended in the fresh growth medium to 4 × 104cells/ml. The viability of cells as assessed by trypan blue exclusion was >99%. 300 μl of cell suspension was added to fill each well, and wells were sealed with an adhesive tape, avoiding formation of air bubbles. The plates were centrifuged at 24.9 × g for 8 min at 4 °C to bring the cells to contact with the substrate (“spin on”); after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the plates were inverted and centrifuged at 100 × g, for 8 min at 4 °C, to dislodge the nonadhering cells from the substrate (“spin off”). The plates were then quick-frozen in a dry ice-ethanol mix. The bottom 3 mm of each well was excised, and the adhering cells were quantified by scintillation counting in the presence of scintillation fluid. The total amount of applied cells (100%) was obtained by quantitation of cells remaining at the bottoms of BSA-coated wells immediately after the first centrifugation (spin on). The same conditions were used to study the inhibition of T84 cell adhesion by various saccharides, except that in this case a 2 × cell suspension (about 8 × 104 cells/ml growth medium) was mixed with medium containing 2 × the final concentration of lactose or cellobiose before 300 μl of the mixture was added to the wells with immobilized galectin-4, laminin, or BSA. To study the localization and function of galectins in a cell culture model of intestinal epithelium, we looked for these lactose-binding proteins in T84 colon carcinoma cells by affinity chromatography of cell extracts on lactosyl-Sepharose. We found that T84 cells express high concentrations of a 36-kDa and a 29-kDa galectin (Fig.1, lanes A and B). The former reacted with anti-rat-galectin-4 on Western blots (Fig. 1, lane C), and the latter was immunoprecipitated by monoclonal anti-galectin-3 antibodies (Fig. 1, lane D). The expression of galectin-4 in T84 cells was confirmed by cDNA cloning and sequencing (Fig. 2 a). The amino acid sequence of the encoded T84 cell protein showed about 80% sequence identity with rat and porcine galectin-4 within the carbohydrate binding domains and about 50% sequence identity within the link region, and it contained all residues that are typically conserved in galectins and known to be associated with carbohydrate binding activity (Fig. 2 b). From these data we conclude that the 36-kDa lactose-binding protein of T84 cells is human galectin-4. Recently, sequences of a large number of randomly picked cDNA clones (expressed sequence tags) (25Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) from a T84 cell cDNA library have become publicly available. A search of these revealed that out of about 9,000 available sequences, 23 correspond to galectin-4, and 8 correspond to galectin-3, but no sequence corresponds to any other galectin. This provides further evidence that galectin-3 and galectin-4 are the main, or maybe sole, galectins expressed by T84 cells. The relative combined amount of galectin-3 and -4 in T84 cells was estimated as the amount of [35S]methionine/cysteine incorporated in the galectins compared with total trichloroacetic acid-preciptable protein from 2.5% Triton X-100 cell lysates. The combined radioactivity incorporated into the two galectins represents 1.4% of the tricholoracetic acid-precipitated radioactivity in early confluent cells but declined to about 0.5% in aging cells. Densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified galectin mixture showed that galectin-4 accounts for 38–60% of the total galectin content. The molar concentration of the galectins in T84 cells was calculated based on the absolute yield of lactosyl-Sepharose-purified galectins from a given area of confluent monolayer. Thus, about 0.5 mg of galectin was obtained from 10 culture plates (10-cm diameter), corresponding to a cell monolayer area of 800 cm2. Since the cells are on average 25 μm high (Fig. 3), this corresponds to a cell volume of 2 ml. Hence the combined concentration of the galectins is 0.25 mg/ml or about 8 μm. Based on the relative amounts of each galectin estimated by densitometry, the average concentration of galectin-3 and -4 in T84 cells is about 5 and 3 μm, respectively. The distribution of the two galectins in T84 cells was examined by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. However, the immunocytochemical detection of the galectins was complicated by an unexpected difficulty in galectin fixation. Application of standard fixation and permeabilization conditions resulted in very weak staining of both galectins, suggesting that the galectins, which are very abundant in T84 cells, were lost because of poor fixation. Indeed, both galectins were found in the solutions used for cell permeabilization and could be purified on lactosyl-Sepharose, showing that they retain activity. It was particularly notable that active galectins could be identified that way even in methanol and acetone solutions (lyophilized and resolubilized in lysis buffer) collected after cell “fixation” for 5 min at −20 °C. Therefore, several permutations of different fixation and permeabilization procedures were tested which included prolonged fixation (12 h with 4% PLP or with 4% paraformaldehyde) followed by mild brief permeabilization with either saponin (0.025% in PBS, 10 min) to visualize intracellular galectins in confluent cells, or standard PLP-fixation without permeabilization to visualize membrane-associated galectins in EGTA-treated confluent and in subconfluent cells. Fig. 3 a presents the localization of galectin-4 (red) and galectin-3 (green) in 25-μm-tall confluent T84 cells as XZ sections after prolonged PLP fixation and brief saponin permeabilization. Galectin-4 is seen mainly as a 1–2-μm-thick layer near the basal membrane. Galectin-3 is mainly found in subapical accumulations revealed more clearly after fixation with paraformaldehyde instead of PLP (Fig. 3 b). XY sections confirmed the apical-basal polarity of galectin distribution and also revealed significant amounts of diffusely distributed galectins (Fig. 4). Thus, panel a of Fig. 4recorded at the level of the apical membrane (26 μm above the substratum) shows mainly galectin-3, whereas panel c recorded 1 μm above the substratum shows mainly galectin-4. The XY sections also revealed particularly dense accumulations of the two galectins with a distinct morphology at the apical membrane (Fig.4 a, arrowheads), which were not seen readily in the XZ sections. Higher magnification of these detergent-resistant apical accumulations of galectins (Fig. 4 d) demonstrates their very defined shape and composition. Galectin-4 is concentrated into circular accumulations with a large adjacent zone of galectin-3 either in the cell center (large arrowhead) or at the site of cell-cell contacts (small arrowhead) at the apical membrane (Fig. 4 d). There is usually one organized accumulation of galectins in each confluent cell, and such formations have not been found in nonconfluent cells. The galectin-4 localization at the adherens junctions in porcine tongue squamous epithelium (5Chiu M.L Jones J.C. O'Keefe E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Chiu M.L Parry D.A.D. Feldman S.R. Klapper D.G. O'Keefe E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31770-31776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was not observed in the permeabilized confluent T84 monolayers. Since this might be due to the difficulties of fixing galectin-4 to its neighboring proteins resulting in its loss from permeabilized cells, as discussed above, we used an alternative approach to look for lateral localization of galectin-4 without permeabilization. To gain access to the extracellular adherens junction area in confluent T84 cells without permeabilization, the tight junction complexes were uncoupled by brief removal of Ca2+ with EGTA followed by fixation with PLP. These EGTA-treated confluent monolayers were double immunolabeled for galectin-4 (red), and cytokeratin (green, Fig.5). Cytokeratin immunostaining was used here as an indicator of the ability of antibodies to gain access to the interior of nonpermeabilized T84 cells; indeed, the anti-cytokeratin antibodies stained a layer about 2 μm inside the cell perimeter, outlining each cell, indicating that antibodies can penetrate nonpermeabilized T84 cells. In the cells treated with EGTA for 15 min, galectin-4 is mainly observed as dramatic red patches (Fig. 5 a,arrowhead) covering a large (8–16-μm long) lateral membrane area of cells next to a site of breakage in the monolayer. Following removal of Ca2+ with EGTA for 30 min (Fig.5 b), cell shapes were much less regular, and there were many more patches of galectin-4 covering the lateral membranes (Fig.5 b, arrowheads), again mostly next to a site of breakage in the monolayer. There was little if any colocalization of cytokeratin with galectin-4. Instead, in these conditions galectin-4 seemed to be localized more toward the cell periphery than cytokeratin, or extracellularly. These characteristic lateral galectin-4 patches were never seen in confluent monolayers that had not been treated with EGTA, but they persisted upon permeabilization. Since in porcine oral squamous epithelium galectin-4 colocalizes with E-cadherin"

This antiviral response is thought to be mediated by association of double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA), a by-product of viral replication, with two ds-RNA-binding domains (DRBDs) located in the amino terminus of PKR. Recent studies have observed that expression of mammalian PKR in yeast leads to a slow growth phenotype due to hyperphosphorylation of eIF-2α. In this report, we observed that while DRBD sequences are required for PKR to function in the yeast model system, these sequences are not required for in vitro phosphorylation of eIF-2α. To explain this apparent contradiction, we proposed that these sequences are required to target the kinase to the translation machinery. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation, we found that wild-type PKR was associated with ribosomes, specifically with 40 S particles. Deletions or residue substitutions in the DRBD sequences blocked kinase interaction with ribosomes. These results indicate that in addition to mediating ds-RNA control of PKR, the DRBD sequences facilitate PKR association with ribosomes. Targeting to ribosomes may enhance in vivo phosphorylation of eIF-2α, by providing PKR access to its substrate.

Pastore A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3572-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized DRBD-containing proteins is the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, PKR, that functions in a cellular antiviral response and is transcriptionally induced by interferon (6Mathews M.B.

The eIF-2 bound to Met-tRNAiMet and GTP associates with 40 S ribosomal subunits and facilitates recognition of the start codon during translation initiation (11Merrick W.C. Microbiol.

Upon completion of this process, the GTP complexed with eIF-2 is hydrolyzed to GDP. Phosphorylation of eIF-2α by PKR impedes the exchange of eIF-2-GDP to the GTP-bound form that is required for the next round of translation initiation. The resulting reduction in eIF-2-GTP levels inhibits cellular protein synthesis and blocks viral proliferation into neighboring cells (11Merrick W.C. Microbiol.

Activation of PKR during viral infection is thought to be regulated directly by double-stranded RNA (ds-RNA) that is produced during viral replication. Evidence supporting this model is the observation that the addition of ds-RNA to a purified in vitro system stimulates both PKR autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of eIF-2α (7Samuel C.E. J.

Although the molecular details of this regulation are not yet clear, it is thought that ds-RNA-induced autophosphorylation of PKR participates in kinase activation, perhaps by enhancing the affinity of PKR for ATP (6Mathews M.B.

Expression of human PKR in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient for its endogenous eIF-2α kinase encoded by GCN2 led to hyperphosphorylation of eIF-2α at serine 51, resulting in a slow growth defect due to a general inhibition of translation initiation (18Feng G.S.

Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The remaining portion, estimated at less than 20% of the total PKR, was found in the nucleus in proximity to the nucleoli (40Jeffrey I.W. Kadereit S. Meurs E.F. Metzger T. Bachmann M. Schwemmle M. Hovanessian A.G. Clemens M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It was proposed that newly synthesized PKR associates with ribosomes in close vicinity to its own mRNA, resulting in a localized phosphorylation of eIF-2α that would preferentially diminish the synthesis of PKR protein. Transfection of mammalian cells with PKR cDNAs showed that alterations in an invariant kinase residue or in DRBD sequences decreased its ability to regulate its own synthesis (29Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 36Barber G.N. Wambach M. Wong M.L. Dever T.E. Hinnebusch A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Interestingly, expression of certain kinase-inactive mutant forms of PKR in NIH 3T3 cells conferred a malignant transformation phenotype, and subcutaneous injection of these transfected cells in nude mice gave rise to rapid tumor growth (41Barber G.N. Wambach M. Thompson S. Jagus R. Katze M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3138-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 42Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17423-17428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When similar experiments were carried out with wild-type PKR, no transformed phenotype was observed. These results suggest that the kinase functions as a tumor suppressor, since expression of a mutant PKR in NIH 3T3 cells appeared to reduce the activity of the endogenous wild-type PKR (42Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 43Meurs E.F. Galabru J. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it suggests that levels of eIF-2α phosphorylation in cells are important for control of cell proliferation. Consistent with this model, Donzeet al. (45Donze O. Jagus R. Koromilas A.E. Hershey J.W. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3828-3834Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) showed that expression of a mutant form of eIF-2α that contains an alanine at the PKR phosphorylation site, serine 51, in NIH 3T3 cells resulted in malignant transformation. However, other mechanisms for cell transformation by PKR have not been ruled out. Recent studies have shown that PKR can also phosphorylate the IκB family of inhibitors that regulate the transcription factor NF-κB (46Kumar A. Haque J. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. Williams B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6288-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 47Maran A. Maitra R.K. Kumar A. Dong B. Xiao W. Li G. Williams B.R. Torrence P.F. Silverman R.H. Science. 1994; 265: 789-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In this report, we observed that while motifs 1 and 2 are essential for PKR function in the yeast model system, these sequences are not required for in vitro phosphorylation of eIF-2α. To explain this apparent contradiction, we proposed that the in vivo requirement for DRBD sequences is due to their role in targeting PKR to the translation machinery. Using sucrose gradient sedimentation, we did indeed find that wild-type PKR was associated with ribosomes, specifically with the 40 S particles. Deletions or residue substitutions in motif 1 or 2 blocked kinase interaction with ribosomes. Together, these results indicate that the DRBD sequences carry out a dual function in the regulation of PKR phosphorylation of eIF-2. First, motifs 1 and 2 are proposed to mediate ds-RNA stimulation of kinase activity. Our results are consistent with the idea that the DRBD sequences function together to repress PKR kinase activity. Binding of ds-RNA to these motifs would release their inhibitory affect, allowing for activation of the kinase. The second function of the DRBD sequences is appropriate targeting of PKR to the translational machinery. Localization of PKR to ribosomes may increase in vivo access to its eIF-2 substrate. Human PKR was expressed in yeast using plasmid p1420 (33Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) that contains the PKR cDNA inserted into a modified pEMBLyex4 vector. Plasmid pEMBLyex4 is a high copy numberURA3-based vector containing the galactose-inducibleGAL-CYC1 hybrid promoter (48Cesareni G. Murray J. Setlow J.K. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 135-154Google Scholar). Plasmid p1420 was transformed into yeast strains H1817 (MAT a ura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 Δgcn2 Δsui2 GCN4-lacZ p1098 (SUI2-S51A, LEU2)) and H1816 (MAT aura3–52 leu2–3 leu2–112 Δgcn2 Δsui2 GCN4-lacZ p1097 (SUI2 LEU2)) (49Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Strains H1817 and H1816 are isogenic and differ only in their SUI2 alleles that encode eIF-2α. To induce expression of PKR, the transformed strains were first grown in synthetic dextrose medium (50Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1974Google Scholar) supplemented with 2 mmleucine, 1 mm isoleucine, 1 mm valine at 30 °C for 30 h. The saturated cultures were then diluted 1:50 into synthetic minimal medium containing 10% galactose and 2% raffinose, and cells were grown for 15 h at 30 °C. Mutant PKR alleles were similarly expressed in yeast strains H1817 and H1816 using pEMBLyex4-derived expression plasmids that were previously described (34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR-A68P and PKR-A158P contain proline substituted for alanine at positions 68 and 158, respectively (19Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase-defective mutant PKR-K296R contains an arginine for the invariant lysine at residue 296 (51Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S.B. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). PKR-Δ1 initiates at a methionine at position 98, resulting in a deletion of motif 1 from residues 1–97 (19Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR-Δ2 has a deletion of residues 103–158 that includes motif 2 (19Green S.R. Mathews M.B. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 2478-2490Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PKR-Δ14–257 is deleted for both DRBD sequences between residues 14 and 257. PKR-ΔK is deleted for the kinase catalytic domain between residues 271 and 551 (34Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants of H1817 (SUI2-S51A) expressing different alleles of PKR were grown in synthetic medium containing 10% galactose and 2% raffinose for 15 h at 30 °C. Cells were chilled, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, and 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) and protease inhibitors (1 μmpepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 0.15 μmaprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cells were lysed using glass beads and a Vortex mixer, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford dye-binding procedure (52Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). Kinase reaction samples containing 5 μg of protein were first prephosphorylated with 20 μm nonradiolabeled ATP in 90 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. This step reduced the incorporation of 32P into endogenous yeast proteins and can be eliminated without affecting the measured specific activity relative to wild-type PKR. After incubating the samples at 30 °C for 20 min, 2 μg of recombinant eIF-2α substrate and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final concentration of 40 μm ATP were added to the kinase reactions. In experiments measuring PKR activation by ds-RNA, 0.1 or 1 μg/ml poly(I)·poly(C) (Sigma) was also added to the assay. As described previously (53Zhu S. Sobolev A.Y. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the eIF-2α substrate is a modified form of yeast eIF-2α that is deleted for residues 200–304 and contains a polyhistidine “tag” for rapid purification. The deletion of the carboxyl-terminal residues of eIF-2α removes three phosphorylation sites for casein kinase II (54Feng L. Yoon H. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5139-5153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,55van den Heuvel J. Lang V. Richter G. Price N. Peacock L. Proud C. McCarthy J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The final volume of the kinase reaction was 100 μl, and 15-μl aliquots were removed from the sample after 1, 2, 4, 10, and 20 min of incubation at 30 °C. The aliquots were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. All in vitro kinase assays were carried out in at least three independent experiments. The eIF-2α in the kinase assays often showed some modest proteolytic degradation resulting in two bands of phosphorylated substrate. PKR immunoprecipitation kinase assays were carried out as described previously (56Galabru J. Katze M.G. Robert N. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 178: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Levels of eIF-2α phosphorylation were quantitated by measuring32P incorporation using a Bio-Rad model GS-250 molecular imager. The 32P levels/mg of total protein for each sample were plotted versus time, and the initial velocity, presented in arbitrary units and normalized to wild-type PKR, was determined by measuring the slope of the linear portion of the curve (Table I). The specific activity for each PKR protein was determined by dividing the initial velocity by the level of kinase protein relative to wild-type PKR.Table IDRBD sequences are dispensable for in vitro phosphorylation of eIF-2α by PKRPKR allelesInitial velocity1-aThe initial velocity of enzymatic activity for wild-type and mutant PKR expressed in H1817 (Δgcn2 SUI2-S51A) was measured by plotting 32P emission levels/mg of total protein for each sample versus time.

This report shows two mechanisms by which fibrinogen can affect the fibrinolysis rate in vitro and thus may lead to thrombosis. First, the lysis rate of fibrin decreases as the initial concentration of fibrinogen increases. Second, a minor variant form of fibrinogen decreases the rate of fibrinolysis. This variant, γA/γ′ fibrinogen, has one altered γ chain and is known to bind to factor XIII zymogen. In a fibrinolysis assay containing purified thrombin, fibrinogen, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen, clots from γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogen lysed at similar rates. However, when factor XIII was added, slower lysis was seen in γA/γ′ fibrin clots when compared with γA/γA fibrin clots. A D-dimer agglutination assay showed that the γA/γ′ clots were more highly cross-linked than the γA/γA clots. The lysis rates of γA/γ′ clots were similar to γA/γA clots in the presence ofN-ethylmaleimide, a specific inhibitor of factor XIIIa. The γA/γ′ fibrin clots made in the presence of factor XIII showed increased proteolytic resistance to both plasmin and trypsin. Clots made from afibrinogenemic plasma reconstituted with γA/γ′ fibrinogen also showed significant resistance to lysis compared with γA/γA fibrinogen. These data demonstrate γA/γ′ fibrin is resistant to fibrinolysis, possibly as a result of concentrating factor XIII on the clot. The total fibrinogen concentration and the amount of γA/γ′ fibrinogen increase clot stability in vitro and thus may contribute independently to the risk of thrombosis in humans.

Fibrinogen is a 340,000-Da dimeric glycoprotein composed of three polypeptide chains, α (Mr = 65,000), β (Mr = 56,000), and γ (Mr = 47,000) linked by disulfide bonds. Fibrinogen is converted to fibrin through limited proteolysis by thrombin, which exposes polymerization sites in fibrinogen (1Kudryk B.J. Collen D. Woods K.R. Blombäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3322-3325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fibrin monomers spontaneously associate with each other to form the weblike fibrin clot (2Blombäck B. Thromb. Res. 1996; 83: 1-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A plasma transglutaminase, factor XIII, strengthens the fibrin clot by forming covalent bonds between adjacent fibrin monomers (3Lorand L. Jeong J.M. Radek J.T. Wilson J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Plasma factor XIII is a 320,000-Da tetrameric protein composed of two polypeptide a chains (Mr = 83,000) and two polypeptide b chains (Mr = 80,000) (4Schwartz M.L. Pizzo S.V. Hill R.L. McKee P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1395-1407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor XIII normally circulates as an inactive proenzyme until it is activated by thrombin cleavage of a 4000-Da activation peptide from each a subunit, which is followed by the dissociation of the b subunits. Activated factor XIII, or XIIIa, catalyzes the formation of γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine bonds between polypeptide chains in fibrin (5Chen R. Doolittle R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1969; 63: 420-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These cross-links strengthen the fibrin clot (6Lorand L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1972; 202: 6-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and increase its resistance to lysis (7Gaffney P.J. Whitaker A.N. Thromb. Res. 1979; 14: 85-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Reed G.L. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Thromb.

Recent evidence has revealed an association between a variant form of fibrinogen and factor XIII that may play a role in modulating the stability of a fibrin clot. This fibrinogen variant, referred to as γA/γ′ fibrinogen, peak II fibrinogen (10Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5223-5227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), γA-γB fibrinogen (11Lawrence S.O. Wright T.W. Francis C.W. Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2406-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or Fγ50, 57.5 (12Peerschke E.I.B. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Blood. 1986; 67: 385-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contains an altered γ chain termed γ′ (13Wolfenstein-Todel C. Mosesson M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5069-5073Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), γB (14Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5599-5604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or γ57.5 (12Peerschke E.I.B. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Blood. 1986; 67: 385-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and comprises approximately 7–15% of the total fibrinogen found in plasma (10Mosesson M.W. Finlayson J.S. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 5223-5227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ′ chain arises from alternative processing of the γ chain mRNA (15Chung D. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Fornace A.J. Cummings D.E. Comeau C.M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that leads to the translation of a polypeptide with a 20-amino acid sequence substituted for the carboxyl-terminal four amino acids of the γ chain. The physiological function of the γ′ chain remains unclear; however, recent studies have shown that the γ′ chain binds directly to the zymogen form of factor XIII (17Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This suggests that the γ′ chain of fibrinogen may serve as a carrier for factor XIII to increase the local concentration of factor XIII at the fibrin clot. Elevated fibrinogen levels are a major risk factor for thrombosis. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the correlation between fibrinogen levels and thrombosis (18Cook N.S. Ubben D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Ernst E. Ann. Med. 1995; 26: 15-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen may contribute to thrombosis by its role in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Fibrinogen binds to platelet membranes through glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) and thereby mediates platelet aggregation (20Bennett J.S. Vilaire G. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 64: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 21Marguerie G.A. Plow E.F. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5357-5363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrin degradation products stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (22Thompson W.D. Smith E.B. J. Pathol. 1989; 159: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23van Pelt-Verkuil E. van de Ree P. Emeis J.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1989; 61: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which may contribute to narrowing of blood vessels during atherosclerosis. In addition, once fibrinogen is incorporated into the atherosclerotic plaque, it binds low density lipoprotein and sequesters more fibrinogen (18Cook N.S. Ubben D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), thus enhancing plaque formation. Another mechanism by which fibrinogen may lead to thrombotic disorders is by increasing blood viscosity. Increased blood viscosity favors the hypercoagulable state (24Yarnell J.W. Baker I.A. Sweetnam P.M. Bainton D. O′Brien J.R. Whitehead P.J. Elwood P.C. Circulation. 1991; 83: 836-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased fibrinogen levels lead to increased fibrin deposition (25Gurewich V. Lipinski B. Hyde E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1976; 36: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Chooi C.C. Gallus A. Thromb. Res. 1989; 53: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Naski M.C. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13003-13010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the causal role of these potential factors in thrombosis is still unclear. The present report demonstrates that increases in total fibrinogen concentration result in increased clot stability toward fibrinolysisin vitro, suggesting a mechanistic explanation of how elevated fibrinogen levels per se may cause an increased risk of thrombosis. In addition, clots made from γA/γ′ fibrinogen are more stable to fibrinolysis in vitro than clots made from γA/γA fibrinogen. Taken together, these findings suggest that both the total amount of fibrinogen and the amount of γA/γ′ fibrinogen in plasma may be independent risk factors for thrombosis. Plasminogen-free human plasma fibrinogen (Calbiochem) was dissolved in 39 mm Tris-PO4, pH 8.6, containing 5 mm ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA) 1The abbreviations used are: EACA, ε-aminocaproic acid; GPRPC, glycine-l-proline-l-arginine-l-proline-l-cysteine; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and dialyzed exhaustively into the same buffer at 4 °C. Insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The γA/γA and γA/γ′ forms of fibrinogen were separated using DEAE-cellulose as described previously (28Finlayson J.S. Suchinsky R.T. Dayton A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fibrinogen solution was adsorbed to a column of DEAE-cellulose (6 × 20 cm) and eluted with a 1200-ml exponential gradient generated in a 600-ml constant volume mixing chamber from the starting buffer (39 mmTris-PO4, pH 8.6, 5 mm EACA, 0.2 mmPMSF) to the final buffer (193 mm Tris-PO4, pH 4.6, 5 mm EACA, 0.2 mm PMSF). The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm, and 11-ml fractions were collected. The elution profile showed two peaks; γA/γA fibrinogen composed the first peak and γA/γ′ fibrinogen composed the second smaller peak (data not shown). In some experiments, γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogen were further purified using a glycine-l-proline-l-arginine-l-proline-l-cysteine (GPRPC)-agarose affinity resin (29Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the resin was prepared by reacting 10 mg of glycine-l-proline-l-arginine-l-proline-l-cysteine peptide (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Laboratory, Seattle, WA) with 10 ml of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate-agarose (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The dialyzed γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrinogen pool from DEAE-cellulose was adsorbed to a column (3 ml) of GPRPC-agarose, washed with 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.8, 5 mm EACA, 0.2 mm PMSF, and then washed with 2 m NaBr, 50 mm Tris-PO4, pH 7.8, 5 mm EACA, 0.2 mm PMSF. The fibrinogen was eluted in 1-ml fractions with 2m NaBr, 20 mm citrate, pH 5.3, 5 mmEACA, 0.2 mm PMSF and immediately neutralized with 0.02 volume of 2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The fibrinogen fractions were dialyzed into 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2 and stored at −70 °C. Microtiter plate fibrinolysis assays were carried out as described previously by Jones and Meunier (30Jones A.J.S. Meunier A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using 96-well assay plates (Corning 25-880-96). Fibrinogen and Lys-plasminogen (Calbiochem) were added to an interim mixing plate containing assay buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 30 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% Polysorbate 80). A separate assay plate contained α-thrombin (a generous gift from Dr. Walter J. Kisiel, University of New Mexico) and tissue plasminogen activator (Calbiochem) in assay buffer. The fibrinogen/plasminogen solution was then dispensed from the interim plate into the assay plate wells containing thrombin and tissue plasminogen activator. The final concentrations of reagents were 1.25 mg/ml fibrinogen (unless stated otherwise), 30 μg/ml Lys-plasminogen, 16 ng/ml tissue plasminogen activator, and 13.2 NIH units/ml thrombin in a total volume of 100 μl. For assays containing factor XIII (a generous gift from Drs. Michael W. Mosesson and David A. Meh, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Milwaukee Clinical Campus), factor XIII was added to a final concentration of either 10 or 100 μg/ml to the wells in the interim plate containing the plasminogen/fibrinogen mixture. In some assays 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide was also added to the interim plate. The turbidity of the clot was measured at room temperature every 6 min at 405 nm. The optical density was converted to percent lysis as follows,%lysis=A405×100%A405maximumEquation 1 and plotted versus time; the data were then fit to a sigmoidal curve-fitting routine. For clarity, a maximum of 15 data points per set are shown in each graph. A D-dimer agglutination assay kit (Sigma) was used to measure D-dimer content in lysed fibrin clots. Clots were formed from γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrinogen using 1.0 mg/ml fibrinogen, 13.2 NIH units/ml α-thrombin, 16 ng/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator, 30 μg/ml Lys-plasminogen, and 10 μg/ml factor XIII and allowed to lyse completely. After lysis, 50 μl of the lysed clots were serially diluted in the manufacturer's proprietary buffered saline solution, pH 7.3, containing 0.02% sodium azide. 20 μl of the diluted sample were then mixed with 20 μl of a suspension of latex beads coated with mouse monoclonal antibody (MA-8D3) specific for the fibrin D-dimer on the test card. The test card was rocked back and forth, and agglutination was scored after 3 min on duplicate samples. γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrinogen and factor XIII were added to a 96-well assay plate containing assay buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 30 mmNaHCO3, 4 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mmMgSO4, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.01% Polysorbate 80), and α-thrombin was added to the wells to initiate clotting. The final concentrations of the reagents were 1.0 mg/ml fibrinogen, 10 μg/ml factor XIII, and 13.2 NIH units/ml α-thrombin in a total volume of 100 μl. The clots were incubated at room temperature until maximum turbidity was reached. When clotting was complete, 50 μl of 11.7 μg/ml trypsin were added to the clots. The turbidity of the clots was measured every 5 min at 405 nm. The optical density was converted to percent lysis as described above. The γA/γA and γA/γ′ forms of fibrinogen were iodinated with Na125I (DuPont NEN) according to the method of Fraker and Speck (31Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 85,000–120,000 cpm/ng as described previously (29Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasma fibrinolysis assays were carried out using the method of Wun and Capuano (32Wun T.-C. Capuano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5061-5066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the iodinated γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrinogen in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added 1:1 (v/v) to fibrinogen-deficient human plasma (George King Biomedical) at a final concentration of 1.25 mg/ml on ice. (The plasma contained less than 0.1 mg/ml residual fibrinogen.) Clotting of the samples was initiated with 1 NIH unit/ml α-thrombin and the clots were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 0.02% NaN3. Samples were taken daily for 7 days and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge to pellet the insoluble clot. 20-μl aliquots of the supernatant were counted in a gamma counter to measure the soluble125I-fibrin degradation products. The percentage of clot lysis was calculated using the following equation and plottedversus time.%lysis=(supernatant cpm)−(supernatant cpm@time zero)(total cpm added)−(supernatant cpm@time zero)×100%Equation 2 Since high plasma fibrinogen levels predispose individuals to a greater risk of thrombosis, we hypothesized that clots made from high concentrations of fibrinogen may be more resistant to fibrinolysis. To test this hypothesis, fibrinolysis assays were performed using purified components, including fibrinogen, thrombin, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen (30Jones A.J.S. Meunier A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Concentrations of fibrinogen from 1 to 4 mg/ml were used, and clotting was initiated by the addition of thrombin. The calculated lysist½ for clots formed from 1, 2, 3, and 4 mg/ml total fibrinogen concentrations was 18.7 ± 0.1, 30.4 ± 0.7, 55.7 ± 0.6, and 70.3 ± 0.3 min, respectively (Fig.1). The fibrinolysis half-times were essentially linear with respect to the initial fibrinogen concentrations (Fig. 1,inset). Similar results were seen in the absence of factor XIII (data not shown). These results are consistent with other published data (30Jones A.J.S. Meunier A.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1990; 64: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and demonstrate that fibrin clots made at high fibrinogen concentrations are more resistant to lysis, suggesting a mechanistic explanation for the role of fibrinogen as a risk factor for thrombosis (33Lewis M.L. Nachtwey D.S. Damron K.L. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 223-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A second potential risk factor for thrombosis is the amount of γA/γ′ fibrinogen in plasma. This form of fibrinogen has been shown to act as a carrier protein for factor XIII by binding directly to factor XIII via the γ′ chain (17Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this binding may serve to concentrate factor XIII locally at the surface of the growing fibrin clot, thereby resulting in a more highly cross-linked and stabilized clot. Fibrinolysis assays were therefore carried out using purified γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrinogen. As seen in Fig. 2, both the rate of clotting and the rate of lysis were significantly decreased in γA/γ′ fibrin clots. Clots made from γA/γ′ fibrinogen in the presence of factor XIII clotted more slowly and subsequently lysed more slowly (Fig. 2, inset). Clots formed from γA/γA fibrinogen in the presence of physiological factor XIII concentrations (10 μg/ml) showed a lysis t½ of 72 ± 0 min, whereas the clots formed from γA/γ′ fibrinogen had a t½ of 179 ± 4 min. Clot stability was enhanced further in the presence of supraphysiological concentrations of factor XIII. In experiments where the factor XIII concentration was increased to 100 μg/ml, the γA/γA fibrinogen clots showed a lysist½ of 99 ± 1 min, while the clots formed from γA/γ′ fibrinogen had a t½ of 207 ± 8 min. These data suggest that factor XIII increases the clotting time as well as decreases the fibrinolysis rates of γA/γ′ fibrin. In the absence of added factor XIII, fibrin clots made from γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogen clotted and lysed at similar rates, with a lysist½ of 50 ± 1 min for γA/γA fibrinogen and 54 ± 1 min for γA/γ′ fibrinogen (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the resistance of γA/γ′ fibrin to fibrinolysis is dependent on the presence of factor XIII. Furthermore, when factor XIIIa was inhibited as it was formed during clotting by the prior addition of N-ethylmaleimide, the fibrinolysis rates of γA/γ′ fibrin clots were similar to clots made without factor XIII (data not shown). These data show that active factor XIII is required for the decreased fibrinolysis rate of the γA/γ′ fibrin.Figure 3Fibrinolysis rates of γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrin clots are similar in the absence of factor XIII.Fibrinolysis assays using 1.25 mg/ml purified fibrinogen, 13.2 NIH units/ml α-thrombin, 16 ng/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator, and 30 μg/ml Lys-plasminogen were carried out using γA/γA fibrinogen (•) or γA/γ′ fibrinogen (○) in the absence of factor XIII. Clot turbidity was monitored by absorbance at 405 nm and expressed as percent lysis. Each point is the average of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A D-dimer agglutination assay was performed to determine if the γA/γ′ fibrin clots were more highly cross-linked than the γA/γA fibrin clots. As seen in Table I, the lysed γA/γ′ fibrin clots showed positive agglutination down to a dilution of 1:300, whereas the γA/γA fibrin clots showed positive agglutination down to a dilution of only 1:128. These data show that the γA/γ′ fibrin clots are more highly cross-linked, possibly because of high local concentrations of factor XIII at the clot surface due to binding to the γ′ chain.Table ID-dimer formation in γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrin clotsDilutionAgglutinationγA/γA fibrinγA/γ′ fibrin1:16++1:32++1:64++1:128±+1:150−+1:200−+1:256−+1:300−±1:350−−Fibrinolytic digests of γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrin were tested for D-dimer content using an agglutination assay. Open table in a new tab Fibrinolytic digests of γA/γA or γA/γ′ fibrin were tested for D-dimer content using an agglutination assay. It should be noted that these assays were carried out with γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogen that had been separated on DEAE-cellulose and further purified by GPRPC-agarose chromatography. Factor XIII co-purifies with γA/γ′ fibrinogen on DEAE-cellulose (17Siebenlist K.R. Meh D.A. Mosesson M.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10448-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), presumably by binding directly to the γ′ chain in γA/γ′ fibrinogen. We have verified that factor XIII co-purifies with γA/γ′ fibrinogen on DEAE-cellulose, but is depleted from γA/γ′ fibrinogen purified further on GPRPC-agarose (Fig. 4). In experiments using fibrinogen purified only on DEAE-cellulose, the γA/γ′ fibrin clots were resistant to lysis in the absence of added factor XIII (Fig. 5), presumably due to the contaminating factor XIII.Figure 5DEAE-cellulose-purified γA/γ′ fibrinogen is resistant to fibrinolysis without added factor XIII.Fibrinolysis assays using 1.25 mg/ml DEAE-cellulose-purified fibrinogen and 13.2 NIH units/ml α-thrombin, 16 ng/ml tissue-type plasminogen activator, and 30 μg/ml Lys-plasminogen were carried out using γA/γA fibrinogen (•) or γA/γ′ fibrinogen (○). The fibrinogens were purified only on DEAE-cellulose without the use of GPRPC-agarose to remove endogenous factor XIII. Clot turbidity was monitored by absorbance at 405 nm and expressed as percent lysis. Each point is the average of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To ensure that the increased lysis resistance was not due to factor XIII affecting the fibrinolytic system directly, γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrin clots were formed with thrombin and then digested with trypsin. The γA/γA fibrin clots had a lysis t½ of 5.7 ± 0.2 min, while the γA/γ′ clots had at½ of 39.1 ± 1.8 min (Fig.6). These data suggest that the increased fibrinolytic resistance of the γA/γ′ fibrin clots is due primarily to proteolytic resistance, although inhibition of the fibrinolytic system cannot be ruled out entirely. Fibrinolysis assays were also carried out in whole plasma (32Wun T.-C. Capuano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5061-5066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to ensure that the effect of γA/γ′ fibrinogen on clot lysis was not an artifact of the purified fibrinolysis assay. γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogens were iodinated and added to fibrinogen-deficient plasma obtained from an afibrinogenemic individual. Clotting was initiated by adding thrombin, and samples were assayed daily for 7 days to quantitate the amount of soluble fibrin degradation products (Fig. 7). After 7 days, the clots formed from γA/γA fibrinogen showed complete lysis, with a lysis half-time of 4.3 ± 0.1 days, whereas clots formed from γA/γ′ fibrinogen exhibited no detectable lysis. These results demonstrate that γA/γ′ fibrin clots generated in whole plasma, in which a number of potentially confounding factors are present (particularly protease inhibitors), are also resistant to fibrinolysis. Fibrinolytic therapy is a widely used tool in the treatment of thrombosis. Fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator are used to activate the fibrinolytic system by converting the protease zymogen plasminogen to active plasmin, which then cleaves the fibrin clot into soluble components. Unfortunately, the administration of these agents often produces secondary hemorrhagic events that may be life-threatening. The development of new fibrinolytic agents with greater clot specificity is an area of intense study, but less attention has been focused on the factors that determine clot stability. If clot stability could be reduced, then lower amounts of these fibrinolytic agents could be used, thus reducing the chance of adverse side effects. Increased fibrinogen levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (18Cook N.S. Ubben D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 444-452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 19Ernst E. Ann. Med. 1995; 26: 15-22Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are many potential mechanisms to explain how high fibrinogen levels may contribute to the disease process. One possible role is that high fibrinogen levels produce a hypercoagulable state that favors thrombosis. It is known that the plasma levels of fibrinogen have a direct influence on the amount of fibrin formed in clots (25Gurewich V. Lipinski B. Hyde E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1976; 36: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Chooi C.C. Gallus A. Thromb. Res. 1989; 53: 493-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Naski M.C. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13003-13010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study suggests two additional mechanisms through which high fibrinogen levels may lead to thrombosis. In agreement with previously published data, the results show that fibrinolysis rates in vitro vary inversely with fibrinogen concentration (33Lewis M.L. Nachtwey D.S. Damron K.L. Thromb. Res. 1991; 64: 223-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This suggests that in hyperfibrinogenemia, there may not only be a greater propensity for a hypercoagulable state, but the clots that result will also be more resistant to lysis. In addition, the present study shows that γA/γ′ fibrinogen affects the stability of fibrin clots formed in vitro, possibly by increasing the local concentration of factor XIII at the clot. Fibrinolysis assays using purified components revealed that clots formed with γA/γ′ fibrinogen show significantly decreased fibrinolysis compared with γA/γA fibrinogen, but only in the presence of active factor XIII. γA/γ′ fibrin clots are also more highly cross-linked than the γA/γA fibrin clots, as assessed with a D-dimer agglutination assay. The resistance of γA/γ′ fibrin clots to fibrinolysis was verified in reconstituted whole plasma. These results suggest that γA/γ′ fibrinogen levels in plasma may modulate clot stability by affecting fibrinolysis rates. The physiological function of γA/γ′ fibrinogen has been elusive for many years. It is clear that the γ′ chain displays much less binding to the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) (11Lawrence S.O. Wright T.W. Francis C.W. Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1993; 82: 2406-2413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10729-10732Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), but this negative role does not explain the raison d'être for γA/γ′ fibrinogen. The present studies suggest that the physiological role of γA/γ′ fibrinogen may be to increase clot stability by localizing factor XIII at the fibrin clot (Fig. 8). In this scenario, unactivated factor XIII is delivered to the growing fibrin clot by γA/γ′ fibrinogen. Through the action of thrombin, fibrinogen (including γA/γ′ fibrinogen) is converted to fibrin. Factor XIII that is bound to the newly formed γA/γ′ fibrin is subsequently activated to XIIIa, since fibrin acts as a positive modulator in factor XIII activation by thrombin (3Lorand L. Jeong J.M. Radek J.T. Wilson J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 22-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thrombin cleavage dissociates the active a2 dimer from theb subunits of factor XIII, thereby allowing the freea2 dimer to catalyze the cross-linking of the fibrin clot. It is not clear at the present time whether theb subunits remain bound to the γ′ chain or dissociate with the a2 subunits after thrombin activation. Thus, the delivery of factor XIII to the fibrin clot by γA/γ′ fibrinogen could serve to increase the local concentration of factor XIIIa and result in a more highly stabilized clot. The concentration of γA/γ′ fibrinogen in plasma may therefore be a risk factor for thrombosis, independent of the total plasma fibrinogen concentration. The molecular mechanisms that affect the ratio of γAversus γ′ mRNA transcription are unknown, although the liver expresses both mRNAs, while other tissues express only the γA mRNA (35Haidaris P.J. Courtney M.A. Blood. 1992; 79: 1218-1224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that the two mRNAs arise by alternative processing of the original transcript (15Chung D. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16Fornace A.J. Cummings D.E. Comeau C.M. Kant J.A. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12826-12830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it is possible that the relative amounts of the mRNA pools or their relative translation rates in liver vary among individuals, giving rise to different amounts of γA/γA and γA/γ′ fibrinogen. There are presently no data available regarding the variability of γA/γ′ fibrinogen levels in human populations. Epidemiologic studies to address this issue are therefore currently underway. We wish to thank Dr. Michael W. Mosesson and Dr. Kevin R. Siebenlist for many helpful discussions, Dr. David A. Meh for factor XIII, and Dr. Walter J. Kisiel for α-thrombin."

Cellular compartments within eukaryotic cells maintain discrete identities despite the continuous disassembly and reassembly required for the vectorial transport of lumenal and membrane proteins to specific destinations. This requires a molecular basis for membrane identity and strict regulation of the membrane fusion process (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). While recent progress toward understanding the molecular basis of vesicle targeting and fusion has been dramatic (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar), the biochemical reactions responsible for membrane fusion remain poorly understood. Cell-free systems that reconstitute in vitro aspects of vesicle formation, translocation, targeting, and fusion have provided insights on the mechanisms of vesicle fission and fusion at several stages of the protein trafficking pathway (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar).A tightly regulated membrane fusion process underlies the secretion of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters from endocrine and neural cells. Exocytotic fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane is triggered by intracellular Ca2+ concentration increases into the 1–300 μm range (3Llinas R. Sugimori M. Silver R.B. J. Physiol. 1995; 89: 77-81Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified some of the proteins required for regulated fusion (see “Discussion”), but an understanding of the events in which these proteins participate and their relationship to membrane bilayer fusion remains limited due to the lack of functional cell-free in vitro assays for Ca2+-regulated fusion.Studies of regulated fusion have instead utilized permeable cell preparations, most of which exhibit limited permeability or possess limited stability. Exceptions where exocytotic fusion reactions have been studied in vitro in cell-free systems are reconstituted sea urchin egg cortices (4Crabb J.H. Jackson R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2263-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and acinar pancreatic zymogen granule-plasma membrane preparations (5MacLean C.M. Edwardson J.M. Biochem.

Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1413-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and incubated with 0.5 μC/ml [3H]norepinephrine (NE; 45 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.) for 16 h in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbic acid. Labeled cells were washed extensively with and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to remove unincorporated [3H]NE, and the cells were detached from culture dishes by pipetting in cold Kglu buffer (0.02m HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.12 m potassium glutamate, 0.02 m potassium acetate, 0.002 m EGTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). For plasma membrane labeling, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) in 0.1m sodium borate pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl or with 20 μg/ml FITC-wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 60 min at 0 °C.Cell Homogenization and Sucrose GradientsCell homogenates were prepared by passing cell suspensions 15 times through a narrow clearance (10 μm) stainless steel ball homogenizer (9Martin T.F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 168: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min twice in succession to rigorously remove broken cells (monitored microscopically), and the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10 min to recover rapidly sedimenting LDCVs. The 5000 × g membrane pellet was washed by resuspension in Kglu buffer and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Approximately 28% of the [3H]NE in post-nuclear supernatants was rapidly sedimenting and recovered in 5000 × g pellets. The remaining free LDCVs were quantitatively isolated from a 10,000 × g supernatant by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 15 min. Whereas the majority of synaptic vesicle-like microvesicles containing synaptophysin was present in the supernatant of the 40,000 ×g centrifugation, LDCVs in PC12 cells also contain synaptophysin (see Fig. 2). For sucrose gradient purification, 5000 × g pellet fractions were collected on a pad of 2m sucrose in 0.02 m Tris, pH 7.8, 0.15m NaCl, 0.002 m EGTA (TNE buffer), diluted 5-fold, and loaded onto either continuous or discontinuous sucrose gradients. Continuous gradients consisting of 9 ml of a linear gradient of 0.25–2 m sucrose and discontinuous gradients consisting of 2 ml each of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2 m sucrose in TNE were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 20,000 ×g for 30 min and collected from the bottom. For Western blotting, membranes were recovered from gradient fractions by 8-fold dilution in TNE buffer and centrifugation at 150,000 ×g for 16 h. Pellets were solubilized in sample buffer for electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting with antibodies to chromogranin B (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR), synaptophysin (Boehringer Mannheim), SV2 (R.H. Scheller, Stanford), syntaxin (Sigma), and SNAP-25 (Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Baltimore, MD). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to synaptotagmin I were generated using a glutathioneS-transferase-cytoplasmic domain fusion protein of synaptotagmin I. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to synaptobrevin-2 were generated using an N-terminal peptide (SATAATVPPAAPAGEGGPPC) conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Western blots were processed with125I-protein A or 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (DuPont NEN) and subjected to autoradiography.Exocytosis AssaysSecretion assays to monitor the release of [3H]NE were conducted in 0.2-ml reactions that contained Kglu buffer adjusted with CaCl2 to the indicated [Ca2+]f, 0.002 m MgCl2, 0.002 m ATP, and the resuspended 5000 × g pellet. Incubations at 30 °C were terminated by chilling on ice, followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. [3H]NE in supernatant and in 1% Triton X-100-solubilized pellet fractions were determined by liquid scintillation counting and used to calculate the percentage of NE release as [dpm supernatant]/[dpm total] × 100%. Supernatant values were corrected by subtraction of zero time incubation values determined for each experiment. Antibody to rat CAPS was generated by immunizing rabbits with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein representing amino acids 264–364 (accession no. U16802) and an IgG fraction was purified by chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant botulinum neurotoxin E light chain was kindly provided by A. Zdanovsky (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).RESULTSRegulated Exocytosis in PC12 Cell HomogenatesThe Ca2+-regulated secretion of NE is faithfully reconstituted in PC12 cells permeabilized by single passage through a narrow clearance ball homogenizer (6Walent J.H.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent release of NE and other vesicle constituents by exocytotic fusion of LDCVs with the plasma membrane is ATP- and cytosol protein-dependent and inhibited by clostridial neurotoxins that specifically proteolyze synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin (6Walent J.H.

Multiple passes of PC12 cells through a wider clearance ball homogenizer generated a cell homogenate consisting of small membrane fragments and intact LDCVs. Surprisingly, ATP- and cytosol-dependent, Ca2+-activated release of NE was preserved in membranes recovered from the homogenate (Fig. 1 A). The Ca2+-dependent release of NE was not affected by dilution of the membranes, suggesting that the responsive subcellular fraction contained all of the membranes that participate in exocytotic fusion. The responsive fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g and was found to contain ∼28% (12–44%, n = 8) of the cellular LDCVs present in post-nuclear supernatants based on the recovery of [3H]NE or vesicle-specific antigens (see below). Free LDCVs in the homogenate fail to sediment at 5000 × g but are fully recovered by centrifugation at 40,000 ×g consistent with the size (∼75 nm) of LDCVs in PC12 cells (11Wagner J.A. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Comparison of the membranes sedimented at 5000 ×g and 40,000 × g showed that only the former exhibited Ca2+-activated NE release (Fig.1 B), indicating that free LDCVs do not release their contents under standard incubation conditions. Because the LDCVs in the 5000 × g pellet fraction exhibited Ca2+-dependent NE release and sedimented more rapidly than free LDCVs, it was likely that these LDCVs were associated with plasma membranes.Figure 1Ca2+-activated NE release from membrane fractions of a PC12 cell homogenate.[3H]NE-labeled PC12 cells were homogenized by 15 passes through a ball homogenizer. A, membranes collected at 15,000 × g and 40,000 × g were resuspended in Kglu buffer, pooled and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the absence (○) or presence (•) of 10 μmCa2+, 2 mm MgATP, and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol. A fixed aliquot of membranes was incubated in the indicated volumes that varied 8-fold. B, membranes from post-nuclear supernatants were collected by sequential centrifugation at 5000 ×g and 40,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended separately and incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C in Kglu buffer (○), buffer supplemented with 3 μm MgGMPPNP (▴), or Ca2+, MgATP, and cytosol (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulated Exocytosis in a LDCV-Plasma Membrane ComplexTo characterize the membranes present in the 5000 × g pellet fraction, analysis by velocity gradient centrifugation was conducted (Fig. 2). LDCVs in the 5000 ×g pellet fraction sedimented rapidly into the gradient (Fig.2 A, arrow) as indicated by the co-sedimentation of LDCV contents markers [3H]NE, chromogranin B (Fig.2 A), and dopamine β-hydroxylase (data not shown). The vesicle membrane proteins synaptotagmin I, synaptophysin (Fig. 2,A and B), SV2, and synaptobrevin (data not shown) co-sedimented with the contents markers. Rapidly sedimenting LDCVs also exhibited reserpine-sensitive amine transporter activity characteristic of NE-containing LDCVs (Fig. 2 C). Variable amounts of LDCVs were dislodged during preparation and sedimented nearer the top of the gradients at a position characteristic of free LDCVs (e.g. fraction 12 in Fig. 2 A). Incubation of the 5000 ×g pellet fraction under exocytosis conditions prior to gradient analysis revealed that the release of NE occurred from the rapidly sedimenting but not free LDCVs (Fig. 2 D).Plasma membranes were monitored by surface labeling of cells and by immunoblotting with SNAP-25 and syntaxin antibodies. The majority of plasma membrane in the PC12 cell homogenate sedimented at 800 ×g. About 23% of the plasma membrane was recovered in the 5000 × g pellet fraction and the majority of this co-sedimented with LDCVs in sucrose gradients (Fig. 2, B andE, arrow). Co-sedimentation of LDCVs and plasma membranes was also observed in isopycnic gradient centrifugation in sucrose, Percoll and Ficoll (data not shown). Incubation of 5000 × g pellet fractions under exocytosis conditions prior to gradient analysis revealed a redistribution of plasma membranes following membrane fusion (Fig. 2 E). Collectively, the results indicated that the rapidly sedimenting, exocytosis-competent subcellular fraction consisted of LDCVs associated with plasma membrane fragments.Electron microscopy of the membrane complex purified on sucrose gradients was consistent with this conclusion revealing the presence of LDCVs on membrane fragments (Fig. 3, left panel). LDCVs were not evident in membrane fractions that were incubated with Ca2+ in the presence of ATP and cytosol (Fig. 3, right panel) as anticipated if exocytotic fusion and the release of LDCV constituents had occurred.Figure 3Electron micrographs of rapidly sedimenting LDCVs. Resuspended 5000 × g pellet fractions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in Kglu buffer without additions (left panel) or with Ca2+, MgATP, and cytosol (right panel). Material corresponding to fractions 6 and 7 of Fig. 2 A was collected from continuous sucrose gradients and membranes were recovered by centrifugation for fixation in glutaraldehyde and analysis by transmission electron microscopy. Several LDCVs in left panel are indicated byarrowheads. Scale bar corresponds to 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The majority of LDCVs in PC12 cells are morphologically docked at the plasma membrane (12Banerjee A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), but only about one-third of the LDCVs in a post-nuclear supernatant fraction were isolated in a homogenization-resistant complex with plasma membranes. To evaluate the possibility that LDCV-plasma membrane complexes were disrupted during homogenization, the conditions of homogenization were systematically varied. The results (data not shown) indicated that an optimal yield of rapidly sedimenting LDCVs required 5–10 passes through the ball homogenizer, whereas 15–20 passes did not further increase or decrease the number of LDCVs isolated in rapidly sedimenting complexes. These results suggest that a fraction of the LDCVs in PC12 cells exist in an unusually stable docked state, which could represent a very late stage intermediate in the LDCV exocytotic pathway.Characterization of Ca2+-activated Exocytosis from LDCV-Plasma Membrane ComplexThe release of NE from LDCV-plasma membrane preparations exhibited characteristics similar to those described for permeable PC12 cells prepared by a single pass through the ball homogenizer (6Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J.

NE release was entirely dependent on Ca2+, largely dependent on cytosol, and partially dependent on MgATP (Fig. 4 A). Ca2+activation was half-maximal at 2–5 μm and optimal at 10 μm (Fig. 4 B). Ca2+ stimulated the concomitant release of several LDCV constituents in addition to NE including preloaded quinacrine (Fig. 4 C) and chromogranin B (Fig. 4 D). The Ca2+-activated release of LDCV constituents was entirely abolished by treatment with type B, type C (data not shown), and type E (Fig. 4 E) botulinum neurotoxins, indicating a requirement for functional synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 as anticipated for Ca2+-dependent exocytotic fusion (13Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Botulinum neurotoxin-sensitive release of NE from LDCV-plasma membrane preparations was alternatively activated by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs such as GMPPNP in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 B), although the rate of stimulated secretion was lower than with Ca2+ even at maximally effective concentrations (3 μm) of MgGMPPNP.Figure 4Ca2+-activated LDCV fusion in LDCV-plasma membrane complexes requires MgATP and cytosol. A, resuspended 5000 × g pellets from [3H]NE-labeled PC12 cells were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 10 μm Ca2+, 2 mm MgATP, 0.5 mg/ml cytosol, 2 mg/ml rabbit IgG (IgG), or 2 mg/ml IgG purified from CAPS antiserum (αCAPS) as indicated. B, incubations were conducted at 2 mm MgATP in the indicated Ca2+concentrations in the absence (○) or presence (•) of cytosol.C, PC12 cells were incubated with 10 μmquinacrine for 60 min prior to preparation of 5000 × g pellet fractions. Incubations similar to those in B were conducted with 2 mm MgATP in the absence or presence of 10 μm Ca2+ and cytosol as indicated. Membranes were pelleted, and the fluorescence of supernatants was measured (Ex = 424 nm; Em = 505 nm). D, incubations were conducted as in C with 5000 × g pellet fractions from unlabeled PC12 cells, and the supernatants following centrifugation were analyzed by immunoblotting with chromogranin B antibodies. E, incubations were conducted as in A with Ca2+, MgATP, and cytosol following a 3-min incubation at 30 °C with indicated concentrations of the botulinum neurotoxin E light chain (BoNT).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies with permeable PC12 cells had shown that the requirement for MgATP in regulated exocytosis was for priming steps that precede the final step of Ca2+-triggered fusion (7Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The MgATP requirement for NE release from LDCV-plasma membrane preparations was similarly found to be largely met in preincubations with MgATP lacking Ca2+ (Fig. 5), indicating that a priming process was required for optimal exocytosis of docked LDCVs. In permeable cells, the Ca2+-triggered fusion step that follows priming was shown to require a 145-kDa cytosolic protein CAPS (6Walent J.H. Porter B.W. Martin T.F.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 765-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 7Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 2K. Ann, J. A. Kowalchyk, and T. F. J. Martin, submitted for publication. CAPS was also found to be necessary for Ca2+-triggered fusion in the LDCV-plasma membrane preparation, as indicated by the specific inhibition observed with IgGs from CAPS immune serum but not control IgGs (Fig.4 A). A nearly complete (90%) inhibition of cytosol-dependent NE release was observed in incubations with a different CAPS antibody (data not shown), indicating that the incomplete inhibition shown in Fig. 4 A was attributable to properties of the antibody.Figure 5The MgATP requirement for Ca2+-activated LDCV fusion in LDCV-plasma membrane complexes is met in a priming preincubation. Two-stage incubations were conducted with additions indicated. First stage 30-min incubations contained 1 mg/ml cytosol in the absence or presence 2 mmMgATP. Membranes were washed by centrifugation and incubated for 10 min in second stage incubations containing 10 μmCa2+ and 0.5 mg/ml cytosol with or without 2 mmMgATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Docked but Not Undocked LDCVs Undergo Regulated ExocytosisThe results of Figs. 1 B and 2 D indicated that only LDCVs associated with plasma membranes were triggered to exocytose by Ca2+. It was of interest to determine whether free LDCVs could undergo exocytosis in the presence of plasma membranes, and whether LDCV-plasma membrane complexes were competent to dock and fuse additional LDCVs. Mixing experiments were undertaken in which free LDCVs were incubated with LDCV-plasma membrane preparations under exocytosis conditions. Incubating unlabeled LDCV-plasma membrane preparations with [3H]NE-loaded free LDCVs in various proportions under exocytosis conditions failed to elicit release of [3H]NE (data not shown). Similarly, co-incubating [3H]NE-loaded LDCV-plasma membrane preparations with [3H]NE-loaded free LDCVs in the presence of Ca2+, MgATP and cytosol failed to elicit more [3H]NE release than that observed for the LDCV-plasma membrane complexes alone (Fig. 6). Similar studies with GMPPNP to trigger fusion at low Ca2+ concentrations also failed to provide evidence for fusion of free LDCVs with the plasma membrane (data not shown). The results indicated that exocytosis was restricted to LDCVs already docked at the plasma membrane and that LDCV recruitment to and functional docking at the plasma membrane was not reconstituted in the standard exocytosis assay.Figure 6Free LDCVs fail to dock and fuse with LDCV-plasma membrane complexes. Free LDCVs and LDCV-plasma membrane complexes were prepared from [3H]NE-labeled PC12 cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” Exocytosis incubations were conducted in the presence of Ca2+, MgATP, and cytosol with LDCV-plasma membrane complexes alone, LDCVs alone, or LDCV-plasma membrane complexes plus LDCVs where indicated. Co-incubations contained free LDCVs at 1.5- or 3-fold the number of complexed LDCVs based on [3H]NE content.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONElucidation of the process of Ca2+-regulated membrane fusion will require identification of proteins that mediate secretory vesicle transport to, docking at, and fusion with the plasma membrane as well as those that mediate the Ca2+ regulation of steps in this sequence. Some of the proteins required for regulated exocytosis have recently been identified, but their precise roles are poorly understood. The SNARE proteins (for soluble NSF attachment protein receptors) synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25, which are the targets of clostridial neurotoxin proteolytic activity (14Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) and the receptors for the NSF/SNAP proteins required for constitutive fusion (2Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2603) Google Scholar), form oligomeric complexes that are proposed to function in vesicle docking and/or fusion (2Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1995) Google Scholar, 16Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Studies on the Ca2+-binding vesicle protein synaptotagmin suggest its possible role as a Ca2+-dependent regulator of exocytosis (13Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Many additional proteins potentially involved in regulated secretion have been identified genetically or biochemically but remain poorly understood (13Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 17Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol., in press. 1997; Google Scholar). Physiological studies in neuroendocrine cells indicate that secretory granules are staged at numerous points in the exocytotic pathway in transit to the plasma membrane for fusion (18Henkel A.W. Almers W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and that Ca2+ accelerates granule transit through several stages that include recruitment to the plasma membrane for docking, post-docking priming steps, fusion pore formation, and fusion pore expansion (17Martin T.F.J. Trends Cell Biol., in press. 1997; Google Scholar). It will be essential to reconstitute these stages along the exocytotic route in vitro as distinct biochemical steps in which the role of specific proteins can be assessed and their mechanisms determined.Some progress toward elucidating partial reactions in the exocytotic pathway has been achieved with permeable neuroendocrine cells. In permeable PC12 cells where the majority of LDCVs are morphologically docked, ATP-dependent priming steps precede and are required for Ca2+-activated fusion steps (7Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 12Banerjee A. Barry V.A. DasGupta B.R. Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20223-20226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated secretion in LDCV-plasma membrane preparations similarly exhibited a requirement for ATP. Because the LDCVs are stably docked at the plasma membrane, the results indicate that priming is distinct from vesicle recruitment or docking and that it occurs in vitro following docking and prior to fusion.Two distinct ATP-dependent priming reactions have been characterized in permeable PC12 cells. In the first of these, PI transfer protein and phosphoinositide kinases catalyze synthesis of PI(4,5)P2, which is"

The level of activation of this receptor by transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) is controlled, in part, by the rate of transcription of the TGF-α gene. In the characterization of the proximal TGF-α promoter by DNase I footprinting, a 43-base pair element (−88 to −130 relative to the transcription start site), designated TαRE I, was found that was specifically protected by nuclear proteins from human mammary carcinoma MDA468 cells. TαRE I was essential for the maximal expression of the TGF-α gene as indicated by deletion and mutagenesis analyses.

In many cases, tumor cells coexpress TGF-α and the EGF receptor, suggesting an autocrine mechanism of growth stimulation (15Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1985; 313: 745-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). That TGF-α is also a potent inducer of angiogenesis in vivo (16Schreiber A.B. Winkler M.E. Derynck R. Science. 1986; 232: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) suggests that host support for the tumor might also be induced through the expression of this growth factor by the tumor cells. These models, indicating the involvement of TGF-α in tumorigenesis, utilize heterologous promoters; however, TGF-α gene transcription is also up-regulated through its own promoter. For example, the TGF-α promoter regulates expression of this gene through development (17Massague J. J. Biol.

To determine how the endogenous TGF-α gene is regulated, the promoters of the human and rat TGF-α genes have been cloned (23Raja R.H. Paterson A.J. Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. Mol.

Their most characteristic features are the apparent lack of TATA and CCAAT sequences (25Jakobovits E.B. Schlokat U. Vannice J.L. Derynck R. Levinson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5549-5554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and high GC contents. Elements in the human and rat TGF-α promoters have been partially characterized. The human core promoter contains a nonconsensus TATA box that is recognized by TATA-binding protein (27Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4694-4701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an initiator element that accurately orients the transcription complex, giving rise to an unique transcription initiation site (28Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 704-712PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Sp1 (human and rat) and p53 (human) play roles as transcriptional enhancers for the TGF-α promoter (18Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Grant III, J.H. Meluch A.A. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell.

In our characterization of the proximal TGF-α promoter, we noted a 43-bp DNase I footprint that contained a GC-rich element that resembled a consensus Sp1 binding site. This paper describes a more detailed analysis of the proteins that bind to this element. These studies revealed that the footprint results from the binding of two sequence-specific transcription factors, one of which we have identified as AP-2. These proteins bind simultaneously to this element and are involved in the regulation of the 1.1-kb TGF-α promoter activity. Our studies indicate that AP-2 regulates TGF-α transcription in vivo through its site in the TGF-α promoter. Our demonstration of the involvement of AP-2 in the regulation of the TGF-α promoter may contribute to our understanding of how TGF-α expression is regulated during carcinogenesis and during development. The 220-bp TGF-α promoter (−181 to +38, relative to the transcription initiation site) was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL2 basic plasmid (Promega) to make pGL-181/+38 as described previously (28Shin T.H. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 704-712PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.1-kb TGF-α promoter (−1069 to +38) was cloned into the Sac I and Hin dIII sites in the same vector to give pGLT1.1. Mutations were introduced into the TGF-α promoter by site-directed mutagenesis. pGL2 basic plasmid contains a bacteriophage replication origin and was used to generate single-stranded template DNA. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotide primers for each mutant promoter were as follows with the mismatch sequences underlined: M−89/−96, 5′-GAGGACCGAGCGCCTAGAATTCAGCACTCGCCCCGCAG-3′; M−97/−103, 5′-GAGCGCCTCTCTGCTGAATTCTTCCCCGCAGCGCTGCC-3′; M−104/−111, 5′-CTCTGCTGGCACTCGAGAATTCACGCTGCCCGCCGGGC-3′; M−112/−118, 5′-GCACTCGCCCCGCAGTTGAATACGCCGGGCGGAAATAG-3′; M−121/−128, 5′-CCGCAGCGCTGCCCGTGAATTCTAAATAGGAAGGCGGC-3′. T1.1PREm, T1.1 DREm, and T1.1(−104 m) contain the same mutation as that of M−89/−96, M−121/−128, and M−104/−111, respectively, and the same strategy was used to construct these mutants. The introduction of mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. To construct deletion mutant pΔ−89/−128, pM−89/−96, and pM−121/−128 were digested with Eco RI. The resulting 5-kb fragment from pM−121/−128 and the 0.7-kb fragment from pM−89/−96 were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated to each other in proper orientation. To construct pD−68, the sequence from −65 to −70 in the TGF-α promoter was mutated to a Apa I site by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. The plasmid was then cut withApa I and Eco RI, and the 0.7-kb fragment was isolated and ligated into the same sites in pBluescriptKS(+) (Stratagene). The resulting plasmid was cut with Hin dIII andKpn I, and the 110-bp fragment was ligated into the same sites in pGL−181/+38, thus substituting for the wild type 220-bp TGF-α promoter. The same strategy was used to construct pD−126 except that the sequence from −123 to −128 in the TGF-α promoter was mutated to an Apa I site. pD−15 was constructed by digesting pGL−181/+38 with Sac II and religating the resultant ∼5.8-kb fragment. Oligonucleotides containing either wild type TαRE I (−83 to −138 of the TGF-α promoter) or TαRE I with a mutation at the distal regulatory element (DRE) were synthesized, with the Hin dIII and Xho I sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. These oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the same sites in pT81Luc (ATCC, plasmid 37584) to make pTαREI-TK and pDREm-TK. pSX is a eukaryotic expression vector containing the SV-40 promoter. AP-2 cDNA was cloned into multiple cloning sites of pSX to make pSX-AP2. MDA468 and HepG2 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum or 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Medium of HepG2 cells also contains 0.1 mm minimum essential medium nonessential amino acid solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were grown to confluence, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and resuspended in full culture medium. For transfection with MDA468 cells, approximately 1.0 × 107 cells were transfected by electroporation with a total of 30 μg of plasmid DNA consisting of 20 μg of the indicated promoter-luciferase construct and 10 μg of the pCMV-β-gal, a plasmid containing the CMV promoter-driving β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency (18Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Grant III, J.H. Meluch A.A. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection with HepG2 cells, approximately 5.0 × 106 cells were electroporated with 5 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid, 5 μg of pCMV-βgal, and 1 μg of either pSX or pSX-AP2. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (18Shin T.H. Paterson A.J. Grant III, J.H. Meluch A.A. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3998-4006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from either MDA468 cells or HepG2 cells (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.Greene Publishing Associates, Inc./John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. 1993; : 12.1.1-12.1.9Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides for gel mobility shift assays were labeled with either [α-32P]dATP or [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 30–35 μl consisting of 50,000–80,000 cpm of probes, 6 μg of MDA468 cell nuclear extract protein, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 2 mmspermidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, with or without an excessive amount of competitor oligonucleotides. The reactions were then resolved on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer. For the antibody supershift assay, 0.5–2 ng of the rabbit polyclonal anti-AP-2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was also included in the reaction. Oligonucleotides used in gel mobility shift assays were as follows (only top strands are shown): DRE, 5′-GATCTTCCTATTTCCGCCCGGCGGGCAGCGCTGAGACGC-3′; proximal regulatory element (PRE), 5′-GCGCTGCGGGGCGAGTGCCAGCAGAGAGGCGCTC-3′; and DREm,5′-GATCTTCCTATTTAGAATTCACGGGCAGCGCTGAGACGC-3′. Consensus oligonucleotides for AP-2 and Sp1 were obtained from Promega. pGL-181/+38 was cut byHin dIII, and the exposed 3′-end of the noncoding strand of the TGF-α promoter was labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. The plasmid was then purified, and the 220-bp radiolabeled fragment of the TGF-α promoter was excised from the plasmid DNA using Kpn I. The resulting labeled fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The binding reaction for DNase I footprinting was carried out in a total volume of 45 μl containing 30,000–50,000 cpm of probe DNA, 0 or 5 μl of partially purified MDA468 cell nuclear extract, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the reaction was subjected to DNase I digestion in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 1 min at room temperature. 100 μl of the stop solution (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to abolish DNase I digestion. The DNA was then separated from the proteins by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in a DNA sequencing gel apparatus (Bio-Rad). To identify the sequence(s) that is important for TGF-α promoter activity, 5′-deletion mutants of the promoter were placed upstream of the luciferase gene and transfected into MDA468 human mammary carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig.1 A, the deletion of the distal 1-kb sequence, from −1069 to −181, caused only a minimal reduction (35%) of the reporter activity. Strikingly, further deletion of a 114-bp fragment (from −181 to −68) resulted in the almost complete loss of the promoter activity. Similar results were obtained using HepG2 cells (data not shown). These data indicate that this proximal region of the TGF-α promoter contains most of the basal regulatory information for TGF-α transcription. To identify potential target(s) for transcription factors in this proximal TGF-α promoter, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments using the 220-bp promoter fragment (−181 to +38) as probe. A 43-bp element was footprinted by MDA468 nuclear extract and designated TαRE I (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and5). DNA sequences between −88 and −130 on the upper strand and between −95 and −114 on the lower strand of the TGF-α promoter were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 1 C). TGF-α expression can be up-regulated by EGF (20Mueller S.G. Kobrin M.S. Paterson A.J. Kudlow J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 976-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Coffey Jr., R.J.

However, responsiveness of the TGF-α promoter to EGF was not affected by the deletions shown in Fig. 1 A (data not shown). Also, protein binding to the promoter remained unchanged upon EGF stimulation (compare lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 5 and 6, Fig.1 B). These data suggest that transcription factors acting through TαRE I regulate TGF-α basal transcription, whereas the EGF-responsive element resides elsewhere in the promoter. To further define TαRE I, a series of site-directed mutations were introduced into this proximal sequence (Fig. 2). The mutated TGF-α promoters were cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene and transfected into MDA468 cells. Transcription from three of the mutant promoters, M−89/−96, M−97/−103 and M−121/−128, was decreased to 38, 51, and 48% of the wild type promoter activity, respectively, whereas that of M−104/−111 and M−112/−118, retained the wild type activity, at 120 and 97%, respectively. Again, TαRE I was found to be nonessential for EGF stimulation because each mutant promoter responded equally well to EGF with a 4-fold increase in reporter activity (data not shown). This mutational analysis suggests that TαRE I contains twocis-acting elements, −89 to −103 and −121 to −128, designated the PRE and the DRE, respectively. Furthermore, in MDA468 cells, the TαRE I was able to enhance transcription from the heterologous herpes simplex TK promoter, when placed upstream of this promoter (Fig. 2). While mutations in either the PRE or DRE resulted in decreased promoter activity, simultaneous deletion of both the PRE and DRE (Δ−89/−128) resulted in the same loss of promoter activity that was seen with mutation in each of the elements alone (Fig. 2). Whether these elements act in concert in the regulation of the TGF-α promoter activity such that both elements are necessary for full activity of the TαRE I will be under further investigation. A similar transcription requirement for TαRE I, especially the DRE, has also been observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). We determined whether protein binding to the TαRE I was affected by mutations at the PRE or DRE. We performed a DNase I footprinting experiment on the 220-bp promoter fragments containing the mutations at either the DRE or PRE (Fig. 3). We found that the three mutant promoters, M−89/−96, M−97/−103, and M−121/−128, which showed decreased promotor activities in the transient transfection assays, also displayed altered patterns of protein binding. Interestingly, mutations directed to either the PRE or DRE alone only abolished protein binding to that same site but did not affect protein binding to the other site. This result also indicates that there are two protein binding sites in TαRE I that correspond to the functionally defined DRE and PRE. The protein binding to either site is independent on the protein binding to the other site. To further characterize the nuclear proteins that bind to the TαRE I, we used oligonucleotides containing either the PRE or DRE sequence as probes in gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 4). Both PRE and DRE oligonucleotides formed complexes with MDA468 nuclear proteins (lanes 2 and 6). The complex formed on the DRE and PRE oligonucleotides had similar gel mobility, but the morphology of the bands were different. The DRE complex consisted of a relatively sharply defined band, whereas the PRE complex appeared more diffuse and is of slightly higher mobility. The binding of these proteins to the oligonucleotides was sequence-specific. The formation of these complexes was inhibited by the presence of a 100-fold excess of the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotides (lanes 3 and8) but the PRE and DRE oligonucleotides could not compete with each other for protein binding (lanes 4 and7). This observation suggests that different proteins bind to these elements. We attempted to determine whether the PRE- and DRE-binding proteins interact with each other with sufficient affinity to allow the detection of a complex using the gel mobility shift assay. Assuming that the PRE and DRE oligonucleotides are each bound by a single protein (see below), interaction between these proteins could be detected by the formation of a higher order and lower mobility complex in a binding reaction that included both oligonucleotides. However, in the gel mobility shift assay using both oligonucleotides, we observed only a simple mixture of the PRE and DRE complexes and no higher order complexes (lane 9). As before, the competition reactions confirmed the specificity of the binding proteins for their respective elements (lanes 10 and 11). This result indicates that even if an interaction between these DNA-binding proteins can occur, it is not sufficiently stable to allow detection by the gel mobility shift assay. Sequence analysis of the DRE indicated the presence of a potential binding site for either transcription factor Sp1 or AP-2 (Fig. 5 A). In a gel mobility shift assay using the DRE as a probe, a 100-fold excess of an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide failed to compete for protein binding (Fig. 5 B, left panel, lane 4). However, a 50-fold excess of an AP-2 consensus oligonucleotides completely inhibited the formation of the DRE-protein complex (lane 5). Moreover, the mobility of the DRE-protein complex was further retarded by the addition of rabbit polyclonal IgG against AP-2 (lane 6), but not by the addition of anti-retinoblastoma protein antibody (lane 7). In a parallel experiment, a 25-fold excess of the DRE probe completely blocked protein binding to the consensus AP-2 sequence (Fig. 5 C,lane 4). Taken together, these results indicate that AP-2 binds to the DRE. The complex formed on the PRE could not be supershifted or inhibited by an AP-2 antibody (Fig. 5 B,right panel, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that AP-2 neither interacts with the PRE nor is complexed by protein-protein interaction with the transcription factor that binds the PRE. In Fig. 2, we have shown that a mutation at DRE decreased transcription from the TGF-α promoter to 48% of wild type (M−121/−128). An oligonucleotide containing the same mutation failed to compete with either the wild type DRE sequence or the consensus AP-2 element for protein binding (Fig. 5 C, lanes 7 and11). Thus, the DRE is recognized in a sequence-specific manner both in the intact cell and in vitro. It has been previously shown that the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line lacks endogenous AP-2 activity. Cotransfection experiments were done to test the functional importance of the AP-2 site in the TGF-α promoter (Fig.6 A). When the wild type TαRE I was placed upstream of a heterologous TK promoter (TαREI-TK), cotransfection of a eukaryotic expression vector for AP-2 (pSX-AP2) increased transcription 2.2-fold compared with pSX alone. AP-2 cotransfection had no significant effect on expression from the TK promoter alone. This AP-2-dependent increase in transcription requires an intact DRE sequence, as indicated by the fact that AP-2 cotransfection failed to activate when the TαRE I element contained the M−121/−128 mutation at the DRE site (DREm-TK). That the transactivation by AP-2 is a result of AP-2 binding to the DRE is further evidenced by a gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extracts from HepG2 cells (Fig. 6 B). No specific DNA/protein interaction was detected on the DRE probe as indicated by competition experiments using a 100-fold excess of the unlabeled probe (comparelanes 2 and 3), consistent with the previous observation that HepG2 cells have no endogenous AP-2 activity. However, the addition of exogenous AP-2 protein resulted in three additional shifted bands, I, II, and III (lane 4). Complexes II and III appear as strong shifts, whereas complex I is much weaker. A 100-fold excess of either unlabeled DRE or AP-2 DNA competed protein binding to all three bands, indicating the specificity of these shifts (lanes 5 and 6, respectively). Complexes I, II, and III were further confirmed to contain AP-2 by the quantitative supershifting of these bands with α-AP-2 antibody (lane 7). The mutagenesis study in Fig. 2 used the proximal 220-bp promoter. However, in vivo, TGF-α transcription is regulated in the context of a larger promoter. We therefore determined the role of the DRE or PRE in the context of the entire promoter as it has thus far been defined. We constructed luciferase reporter constructs in which the DRE and PRE mutations were placed in the entire 1.1-kb (−1069 to +38) TGF-α promoter. Mutations in the DRE (T1.1DREm) or PRE (T1.1PREm) that affected promoter function in the context of the 220-bp proximal promoter had essentially the same effect on the 1.1-kb promoter (Fig. 7), whereas a mutation between the PRE and DRE (T1.1(−104 m)) had no effect on transcription. This result further confirms the importance of these elements in regulating the TGF-α gene transcription. The transcription of the TGF-α gene is regulated under a variety of physiological and pathological circumstances. TGF-α is regulated both temporally and spatially during development, resulting ultimately in the expression of this growth factor in multiple tissues in the adult organism. In most of the tissues examined, TGF-α expression appears to be confined to specific cell types. For example, in the bovine pituitary, maximal expression is seen in the lactotrophs (31Kobrin M.S. Asa S.L. Samsoondar J. Kudlow J.E.

https://openalex.org/W1973058809,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which belongs to the EGF family, is produced as a membrane-anchored form (pro-HB-EGF) and later processed to a soluble form (sHB-EGF). It is known that high expression of pro-HB-EGF occurs in hepatoma tissues, although its biological meaning remains unknown. We established two types of hepatoma cell lines (AH66tc), which stably produce pro-HB-EGF and sHB-EGF, respectively. While sHB-EGF-producing cells (sHB-AH) showed rapid growth, pro-HB-EGF-producing cells (pHB-AH) showed markedly suppressed cell growth as compared with the parental cells. Transforming growth factor β or serum-starved conditions induced apoptosis of mock and sHB-AH as well as the parental cells, but not of pHB-AH. The resistance to apoptosis upon serum-starved treatment was correlated with an increase in the rate of the G1 phase in the cell cycle due to up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The mechanism underlying this resistance of pHB-AH to apoptosis was thought to be related to the prolonged half-life of the EGF receptor followed by continuous phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues. These observations demonstrate a unique function of pro-HB-EGF that is not observed for the mature form and show that pro-HB-EGF may act as a tumor survival factor in hepatoma cells.

The resistance to apoptosis upon serum-starved treatment was correlated with an increase in the rate of the G1 phase in the cell cycle due to up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. The mechanism underlying this resistance of pHB-AH to apoptosis was thought to be related to the prolonged half-life of the EGF receptor followed by continuous phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues. These observations demonstrate a unique function of pro-HB-EGF that is not observed for the mature form and show that pro-HB-EGF may act as a tumor survival factor in hepatoma cells.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6205-6212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was originally identified in the conditioned medium of a human histiotic lymphoma cell line, U937 (1Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), and gene or protein expression of HB-EGF was detected in various rat tissues (3Vaughan T.J. Pascall J.C. Brown K.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells and macrophages of human artheriosclerotic plaques (4Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Inui Y. Tamura S. Yamamoto K. Nishida M. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 404-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and parietal cells of fundic glands and gastrin cells of pyloric glands in the human gastric mucosa (5Murayama Y. Miyagawa J. Higashiyama S. Kondo S. Yabu M. Isozaki K. Kayanoki Y. Kanayama S. Shinomura S. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1051-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It stimulates the growth of a variety of cells in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Membrane-anchored HB-EGF (pro-HB-EGF), which is also known as a diphtheria toxin receptor (6Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russell D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), stimulates adjacent cell growth through cell-cell contact,i.e. in what is designated as a juxtacrine manner (7Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and has been thought to contribute to cell growth like the soluble HB-EGF (sHB-EGF). High expression of HB-EGF was observed in human hepatocellular carcinoma tissues, but not in metastatic liver cancers or normal hepatocytes, suggesting that it is involved in the development or progression of hepatomas in an autocrine manner (8Inui Y. Higashiyama S. Kawata S. Tamura S. Miyagawa J. Taniguchi N. Matsuzawa Y. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1799-1804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During hepatocarcinogenesis in a rodent model, its expression was dramatically induced at the cancer (9Miyoshi E. Higashiyama S. Nakagawa T. Suzuki K. Horimoto M. Hayashi N. Fusamoto H. Kamada T. Taniguchi N. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the polyclonal antibody used in those studies specifically recognizes the pro- form of HB-EGF, not the soluble form. There is no evidence that pro-HB-EGF is cleaved into the soluble form in hepatoma tissues. Even if the pro- form is processed to the soluble form, the mechanism remains unknown.Both pro-HB-EGF and sHB-EGF bind to the EGF receptor (EGF-R) like other EGF family members. Signal transduction occurs after clustering of the receptors followed by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, which results in the triggering of cell proliferation (10Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. I. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 69-171Google Scholar). There are some reports on the clinical significance of EGF-R in breast (11Klijin J.G. Berns P.M. Schmitz P.I. Foekens J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 3-17PubMed Google Scholar) or ovarian cancer (12Scambia G. Benedetti P.P. Battaglia F. Ferrandina G. Baiocchi G. Greggi S. De-Vincenzo R. Mancuso S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1992; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These authors reported that different regulatory mechanisms for EGF-R expression exist in tumor cells compared with normal cells and that the enhanced EGF-R expression was associated with aggressive behavior of tumors. In contrast, the growth of some tumor cells with high levels of EGF-R was found, paradoxically, to be inhibited upon exposure to exogenous EGF even if phosphorylation occurred (13Gill N.G. Lazar C.S. Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 14Gross M.E. Zorbas M.A. Danels Y.J. Garcia R. Gallick G.E. Olive M. Brattain M.G. Boman B.M. Yoeman L.C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1452-1459PubMed Google Scholar). Although both forms of HB-EGF bind to EGF-R, nothing has been reported about differences in the signal transduction following binding to EGF-R including its tyrosine phosphorylation.Apoptosis is regulated through complicated mechanisms, and rescue from apoptosis is related to the immortality of certain cells followed by malignant transformation (15Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Many growth factors and cytokines have been reported to be involved in apoptosis in a positive or negative manner. Some hepatoma cells undergo apoptosis on treatment with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) or anti-cancer drugs (16Fukuda K. Kojiro M. Chiu J-F. Hepatology. 1993; 18: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 17Chuang L-Y. Hung W-C. Chang C-C. Tsai J-H. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 147-152PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggested that TGF-β regulated the proliferation of hepatoma cells as well as hepatocytes during liver regeneration (18Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar), sometimes involving apoptosis. Prevention from apoptosis can be related to tumor development, including promotion of neoplastic progression, tumor growth, and resistance to cytotoxic anti-cancer agents (19Bedi A. Pasricha P.J. Akhtar A.J. Barber J.P. Bedi G.C. Giardiello F.M. Zehnbauer B.A. Hamilton S.R. Jones R.J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1811-1816PubMed Google Scholar). Some oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes, such as bcl2 andp53, are involved in the prevention of apoptosis. While HB-EGF has been thought to be linked to hepatocarcinogenesis, there is no direct evidence of this. In this study, we transfected two forms of the HB-EGF gene, to produce pro- and soluble forms, into a rat hepatoma cell line and investigated their biological functions with emphasis on the relationships to apoptosis. We found that sHB-EGF stimulated the growth of hepatomas and pro-HB-EGF suppressed it through up-regulation of EGF-R and that hepatomas expressing high levels of pro-HB-EGF were resistant to apoptosis induced under several conditions. Possible mechanisms for these functions of pro-HB-EGF are proposed.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureThe rat hepatoma cell line, AH66tc (20Katsuta H. Takaoka T. Yasumoto S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1973; 51: 1841-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was donated by the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Nikken BioMedical Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan) containing 100 βg/ml of kanamycin (Sigma), 50 units/ml of penicillin (Banyu Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Cell numbers were determined on a hemocytometer under a microscope after harvesting with trypsin.Establishment of Soluble HB-EGF or pro-HB-EGF Gene-transfected AH66tc CellsAn expression vector of sHB-EGF was constructed as follows. A point mutation to yield a stop codon (P148-stop) was introduced into the transmembrane domain of mouse HB-EGF cDNA (21Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis with an in vitro mutagenesis kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan), using 5′-GATTCTCCACTTATAGAGTCAG-3′ as a primer, and the mutated HB-EGF cDNA was inserted into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). This method has been described in detail elsewhere (22Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The inserted sHB-EGF gene was directly sequenced, and then the site of mutation was confirmed. An expression vector of pro-HB-EGF was constructed by inserting the full sequence of mouse HB-EGF cDNA into pRc/CMV. Each vector was transfected into AH66tc cells by the electroporation method, and selection was performed as to G418 (Sigma) resistance. Ten clones each of pro-HB-EGF cDNA-, sHB-EGF cDNA-, and vector alone-transfected AH66tc cells (mock) were obtained, and three clones were independently selected in each case.Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was extracted from AH66tc transfectants according to the method reported by Chomczynski and Sacchi (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62956) Google Scholar). 20 βg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and then transferred onto a Zeta-probe membrane (Bio-Rad) by capillary action (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.1-7.87Google Scholar). After hybridization with 32P-labeled mouse HB-EGF cDNA (21Abraham J.A. Damm D. Bajardi A. Miller J. Klagsbrun M. Ezekowitz A.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) at 42 °C in the hybridization buffer (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.1-7.87Google Scholar), the membrane was washed twice for 30 min at 55 °C with 30 mm sodium citrate, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and once for 30 min at 55 °C with 3 mm sodium citrate, 30 mmNaCl, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and then exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen for 2 days. The probe used for p21 mRNA analysis comprised about 300 bases of rat p21 cDNA synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using the sense primer CTCTTCGGTCCCGTGGACAGT and the antisense primer CACCAGAGTGCAAGACAGCGA, which were based on human and mouse p21 cDNA, respectively (25Hoopi K. Siwarski D. Dosik J. Michieli P. Chedid M. Reed S. Mock B. Givol D. Mushinski J.F. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3017-3020PubMed Google Scholar). The probes used for other p27 and p15 mRNA analyses were kindly provided by Dr. M. Nakanishi (Department of Geriatric Research, National Institute for Longevity Sciences). Northern blot analysis of p21, p27, and p15 was performed with the same procedure of HB-EGF mRNA detection.Measurement of Soluble HB-EGF and Pro-HB-EGFThe biological activity of sHB-EGF and pro-HB-EGF was assayed as reported previously (7Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). For assay of the sHB-EGF activity, 25 βl of condition medium derived from each AH66tc transfectant in a confluent state was added to EP170.7 cells, which are mouse leukemia cells whose growth depends on the EGF-R ligand, at 2 × 104 cells/well in a volume of 200 βl in 96-well plates. After 36 h of incubation, 1 βCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. After a 4-h incubation with [3H]thymidine, incorporation into DNA of EP170.7 cells was measured with a β-plate system (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). To measure the juxtacrine activity of pro-HB-EGF, 2 × 105 cells of each AH66tc transfectant were fixed with 5% buffered formaldehyde in 24-well plates and then overlaid with 1 × 105 EP170.7 cells for 48 h. After a 4-h incubation with [3H]thymidine, DNA synthesis by EP170.7 cells collected from the medium was measured by the same protocol as reported previously (7Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis on EGF-R and Its PhosphorylationEach transfectant was lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 βg/ml aprotinin, and 10 βm p-amidinophenyl methanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, 10 βg of proteins in the supernatant were subjected to 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using TE70 and TE77 Semiphor semidry transfer units (Hoefar Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS overnight, the membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-EGF-R sheep IgG. Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) as the first antibody for 4 h at room temperature. After washing with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 30 min, it was incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG (DAKO, Kyoto, Japan) as the second antibody for 1 h. The filter was then washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 for 30 min and developed with a Western blot detection kit, ECL (Amersham Corp.). For the detection of phosphorylated tyrosine residues, AH66tc transfectants under several conditions were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing a phosphatase inhibitor (400 βm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm pyrophosphate, and 10 mmiodoacetate) for 30 min at 4 °C, and PY20, a mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories, KY), and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Kyoto, Japan) were used as the first and second antibodies, respectively. Western blotting was performed according to the method reported by Fan et al.(26Fan Z. Mendelsohn J. Matsui H. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21073-21079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a small modification. Each band was measured by a densitometer.Stability of Cell Surface EGF-R3 × 105cells of sHB-AH and pHB-AH were plated on 6-cm dishes and then incubated for 12 h. Cell surface proteins on the cells were biotinylated with 0.1 mg/ml of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 20 min on ice as described previously (27Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and then cultured in 6-cm dishes with the medium in which each transfectant was cultured. The cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 buffer after 0, 1, 2, and 4 h. The cell lysates obtained with the Nonidet P-40 buffer described above were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-EGF-R. After SDS gel electrophoresis followed by blotting onto a nitrocellulose membrane, the filter was incubated with avidin-peroxidase conjugates, an ABC kit (VECTOR Laboratories Inc.), and developed with an ECL kit (Amersham).Effects of Immobilized HB-EGF on AH66tc Cells250 ng of human recombinant HB-EGF (28Thompson S.A. Higashiyama S. Wood K. Pollitt N.S. Damm D. McEnroe G. Garrick B. Ashton N. Lau K. Hancock N. Klagsbrun M. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2541-2549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) dissolved in 250 βl of 0.2m borate buffer, pH 9.6, was added to each well (16-mm diameter) of a 24-well plate (125 βl/cm2 of 0.01% HB-EGF, 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.5). The plate was incubated for 24 h at 4 °C. The HB-EGF solution was subjected to measurement of the immobilization efficiency of HB-EGF. The immobilization efficiency of HB-EGF was calculated as the average of quadruplicate measurements of soluble HB-EGF activity in each of four independent wells. As judged on this measurement, 50 ng of soluble HB-EGF was immobilized. The wells were then washed five times with PBS. 5 × 103 parental AH66tc cells were plated with 500 βl of DMEM, 2% FCS in each well. For estimation of the soluble HB-EGF activity of AH66tc cells, cells were plated with 500 βl of DMEM, 2% FCS containing an appropriate amount of HB-EGF in wells pretreated with 0.2 m borate buffer, pH 9.6, alone. The cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 °C, trypsinized, and then counted with a Coulter counter (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation on EGF-R was determined as follows: 6-cm dishes were pretreated with 125 βl/cm2 of 0.2m borate buffer, pH 9.5, with or without 0.01% HB-EGF for 24 h at 4 °C. 1 × 106 AH66tc cells harvested with PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA were plated with 1 ml of DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin or 1 ml of DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 ng of HB-EGF on an HB-EGF-immobilized or nonimmobilized dish, respectively. After 12.5 min of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were immediately harvested by pipetting and chilled in ice water. The chilled cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGF-R IgG, followed by Western blotting for detection of phosphotyrosine residues on EGF-R as described above.Analysis of Cell Cycle DistributionAH66tc transfectants in a subconfluent state and a confluent state were harvested with PBS containing 0.2% EDTA and fixed with 70% ethanol. The cells were treated with 1 mg/ml of RNase (Sigma) for 20 min and then stained with 100 βg/ml of propidium iodide (Sigma). After filtration of the cells through 50–70-βm pore size nylon meshes, cell cycle distribution was analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).Apoptosis on Treatment with TGF-β and Serum-starved ConditionsTGF-β treatment was as follows. 1 × 105 AH66tc cells (mock) were plated in six-well plates with RPMI medium containing 10% FCS. After a 12-h incubation, the medium was changed to fresh medium, and the cells were incubated with 5 ng/ml TGF-β for the indicated times. sHB-AH and pHB-AH were treated with 5 ng/ml of TGF-β for 24 h. The DNA of each AH66tc transfectant was purified by proteinase K treatment, followed with phenol/chloroform. The DNAs were electrophoresed on a 0.9% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Apoptosis in situ was detected by the terminal deoxytransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. Briefly, sHB-AH and pHB-AH were cultured in an eight-well chamber slide (Lab-Tek, Nunc). After 5 ng/ml of TGF-β treatment for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The slide was rinsed three times with distilled water, submerged in terminal deoxytransferase buffer (Takara Shuzo, Shiga, Japan), and incubated in biotinated dUTP and terminal deoxytransferase at 37 °C for 90 min. Condensed DNA was visualized with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody and was photographed through a fluorescence microscope. Detailed procedures were given in the manufacturer's protocol of the in situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara Shuzo). Serum starvation was as follows. AH66tc transfectants were grown in medium containing 10% FCS until a confluent state was reached, and then the medium was changed to serum-free medium. Photographs were taken at 1, 7, and 14 days after the change to serum-free medium.RESULTSEstablishment and Characterization of Two Types of HB-EGF Gene-transfected AH66tc CellsExpression of HB-EGF mRNA was detected in neither the parental AH66tc cells nor mock transfectants that had been transfected with pRc/CMV alone. In contrast, 3 clones of sHB-AH (sHB-AH1, -2, and -3) and 3 clones of pHB-AH (pHB-AH1, -2, and -3), which were randomly selected from among 10 clones, showed the expression levels of HB-EGF mRNA in the following orders: sHB-AH3 > sHB-AH1 > sHB-AH2, and pHB-AH2 > pHB-AH3 > pHB-AH1 (Fig. 1). To determine their functional expression, the soluble or juxtacrine growth factor activity of each clone was measured (Fig. 2). Although the conditioned medium produced by sHB-AH stimulated DNA synthesis of EP170.7 cells, such an effect was not seen in the conditioned medium of pHB-AH or mock (Fig. 2 A), indicating that a significant amount of sHB-EGF was secreted by sHB-AH but not detected in the conditioned medium of pHB-AH or mock cells. In contrast, pHB-AH stimulated DNA synthesis of EP170.7 cells in a juxtacrine manner (7Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), but sHB-AH and mock did not (Fig. 2 B), indicating that pHB-AH expressed the functional pro-HB-EGF on their cell surface.Figure 2Soluble and juxtacrine growth factor activity of AH66tc transfectants. A, 20 βl of conditioned medium from the three types of AH66tc cells was added to cultured EP170.7 cells on a 96-well plate. After 48 h, DNA synthesis by EP170.7 cells was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.”Control, addition of medium alone. Data represent means ± S.D. for three experiments. B, formalin-fixed AH66tc cells were cocultured with EP170.7 cells for 48 h, and then DNA synthesis by EP170.7 cells was assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” The details of the procedure were as reported previously (7Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Data represent means for three experiments, and thebars indicate S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell Growth of HB-EGF Gene-transfected AH66tcsHB-AH showed dramatically a rapid growth compared with the other two groups, pHB-AH and mock cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that HB-EGF stimulated the growth of AH66tc cells. Surprisingly, each type of pHB-AH showed much slower growth than mock cells. After 72 h of observation, the difference was prominent. Since pHB-AH also exhibit a juxtacrine activity, the mechanism of growth suppression of pHB-AH must be studied further.Figure 3Changes in cell number of AH66tc transfectants. 5 × 104 of mock (▴), sHB-AH (•), and pHB-AH (▪) cells were cultured in six-well plates, and the cell numbers were determined at the indicated time intervals. Data represent means for three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression of EGF-R and Its PhosphorylationHB-EGF is known to bind with EGF-R, followed by signal transduction. The suppression of cell growth by pro-HB-EGF described above suggested that some modification occurred in EGF-R. To investigate this, we examined the expression of EGF-R by Western blotting (Fig.4 A). Protein expression of EGF-R was about 2–3 times increased in pHB-AH in comparison with the expression level in sHB-AH and mock. The data were almost the same under 70% confluent and 100% confluent conditions (data not shown). After EGF-R binds its ligands, signal transduction occurs with clustering of the receptor, followed by phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues, and then the receptor is internalized into the cytoplasm (10Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. I. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 69-171Google Scholar). The levels of phosphotyrosine residues on EGF-R were equally high in both sHB-AH and pHB-AH but low in mock (Fig. 4 B). Since the protein level of total EGF-R was higher in pHB-AH than in sHB-AH, the net phosphorylation on EGF-R in sHB-AH and pHB-AH was almost the same. When exogenous HB-EGF was added to mock, a 6-fold increase in phosphorylation on EGF-R as compared with the untreated control was observed. In the case of sHB-AH and pHB-AH, this increase was 0.97 and 1.60-fold, respectively. The effects of exogenous HB-EGF were not prominent in these cells, because EGF-R was already phosphorylated through the autocrine mechanisms of HB-EGF or the juxtacrine mechanisms of pro-HB-EGF produced by themselves. When phosphorylation on EGF-R was reexamined at 30 min after changing to fresh medium, the level of phosphorylation was markedly decreased in both sHB-AH and pHB-AH but not so changed in mock. The levels of decreases were significantly higher in sHB-AH than pHB-AH (80–90% versus 60–70%). These results suggested that EGF-R on sHB-AH was phosphorylated by HB-EGF in an autocrine manner and that phosphorylation of EGF-R on pHB-AH was decreased by unidentified mechanisms. This decrease may be caused by a cleavage of pro-HB-EGF due to a stress of changing the medium to a fresh one, which is similar to our previous observations (27Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although the signal via EGF-R was transmitted in pHB-AH, cell growth was suppressed. This inhibitory effect of pro-HB-EGF is controversial and may be involved with the increased EGF-R. To determine the details of the mechanism for up-regulation of EGF-R, the stability of EGF-R was investigated. Since EGF-R was internalized after ligand binding within a minute or so, levels of biotinylated EGF-R in sHB-AH were gradually consumed in an autocrine manner and undetectable at 4 h (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the level of biotinylated EGF-R in pHB-AH did not change for more than 4 h, suggesting that internalization of EGF-R followed by binding with pro-HB-EGF was extremely delayed.Figure 4Western blot analysis of EGF-R and tyrosine phosphorylation. A, 10 βg of cell lysates from AH66tc transfectants was applied to a 6% SDS-acrylamide gel and then analyzed by Western blotting. B, cellular proteins were extracted from AH66tc transfectants with Nonidet P-40 buffer containing a phosphatase inhibitor. 10 βg of proteins was electrophoresed on a 6% SDS acrylamide gel, and then Western blot analysis was performed using anti-phosphotyrosine. Lanes 1, 4, and7 indicate untreated controls; lanes 2,5, and 8 indicate samples of cells at 30 min after changing the medium to fresh one; and lanes 3,6, and 9 indicate samples of cells treated with 5 ng/ml of exogenous HB-EGF for 15 min. C, cell surface proteins from 3 × 105 cultured AH66tc cells were biotinylated, and then the cells were cultured in the medium in which they had been cultured previously. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti EGF-R, and then Western blotting was performed. The bands of biotinylated EGF-R were visualized with a biotin-avidin system and ECL development. The amounts of pHB-AH samples were half of sHB-AH, because basal expression levels were different as shown in Fig. 4 A. All procedures are described in detail under “Mate"

The ficolin polypeptide has a collagen-like domain that presumably brings three subunits together in a triple helical rod, a C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (fbg) similar to that of tenascin, which presumably has the binding activities, and a small N-terminal domain that we find to be the primary site for forming the ficolin oligomer. By sedimentation equilibrium we determined that the main plasma form, which we call big ficolin, had mass of 827,000 Da, consistent with 24 subunits. Little ficolin, about half this size, was obtained after binding to a GlcNAc affinity column. Electron microscopy of little ficolin showed a parachute-like structure, with a small globe at one end, corresponding to the 12 N-terminal domains, and the fbg domains clustered together at the ends of the collagen rods. Big ficolin was formed by the face to face fusion of the fbg domains of two little ficolins, leaving the rods and N-terminal domains projecting at opposite ends. Little ficolin maintained a high affinity for the GlcNAc column, and big ficolin had a low affinity or none. The binding sites for ligands may be obscured in this big ficolin oligomer, providing a regulation of their activity.

Ficolin was originally isolated as a protein from pig uterus membrane extracts that bound transforming growth factor-β (1Ichijo H. Ronnstrand L. Miyagawa K. Ohashi H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22459-22464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two cDNA clones with very similar sequences, ficolin-α and -β, were obtained by screening a pig uterus cDNA library (2Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, ficolins have been identified from human blood as a corticosteroid binding protein, termed hucolin (3Edgar P.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), an elastin binding protein, termed EBP-37 (4Harumiya S. Omori A. Sugiura T. Fukumoto Y. Tachikawa H. Fujimoto D. J. Biochem.

Genomics. 1996; 36: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), were also cloned. cDNA sequences (some of them are partial) suggest that there are two human ficolin genes. One gene codes for human ficolin, ficolin-1, and P35-related gene (which are different names given to this gene product), and the other codes for P35, EBP-37, and hucolin. It is not yet clear how these relate to the two pig genes for α and β ficolins. The amino acid sequence showed that ficolins consist of a short N-terminal domain, a middle collagen-like domain, and a C-terminal fibrinogen-like (fbg) 1The abbreviations used are: fbg, fibrinogen-like domain; SP-A and SP-D, surfactant protein A and D, respectively; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: fbg, fibrinogen-like domain; SP-A and SP-D, surfactant protein A and D, respectively; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. domain (2Ichijo H.

A similar three-domain structure applies to complement protein C1q and the collectins, which include mannose binding protein, conglutinin, and pulmonary surfactant proteins A and D (SP-A and SP-D) (9Thiel S.

These proteins differ from ficolin in that their C-terminal domain is a C-type lectin instead of fbg, but they all have a middle collagen domain and a small N-terminal domain. The collagen domains assemble these proteins into trimers, and electron microscopy shows that four or six trimers are connected together by the N-terminal domain, leaving the C-terminal lectin domains to project in a multimeric array (13Knobel H.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complement proteins like C1q and collectins play roles in immune defense. Collectins bind to carbohydrates on the surface of bacteria and viruses and activate phagocytosis (10Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 11Hoppe H.-J. Reid K.B.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1143-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been indicated that collectin binding to carbohydrate ligands enhances opsonic activity via the C1q-collectin receptor complex (18Malhotra R. Thiel S. Reid K.B.M. Sim R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Malhotra R. Laursen S.B. Willis A.C. Sim R.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ficolins have been implicated in a similar role, in that human plasma ficolin (P35) is a lectin that binds to the carbohydrate of bacterial surface (20Lu J. Le Y. Kon L. Chan J. Lee S.H. Immunology. 1996; 89: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and enhances opsonic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (5Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The binding activities of the collectins are in the C-terminal lectin domain, and it is reasonable to assume that the binding activity ficolin is in the C-terminal fbg domain. Fibrinogen-like domains are found in a number of proteins including fibrinogens β and γ and the tenascins. The ficolin fbg domain is most similar to those of theDrosophila signaling protein Scabrous and the tenascins. See Yee et al. (21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W.

An early study of pig ficolin demonstrated that ficolin secreted by transfected cells was assembled into disulfide-bonded oligomers, but these were not characterized, and there has been little study of the structure of natural ficolins. In the present study, we have purified ficolin from pig plasma using antibody andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) affinity columns. We have determined its molecular weight and hydrodynamic parameters by gel filtration chromatography, glycerol gradient sedimentation, and sedimentation equilibrium and demonstrated a unique structure by electron microscopy. The fbg domains of pig ficolin-α ((m)CLTGP … FRAT*; (m) indicates an initiation methionine not part of the ficolin sequence and * indicates the natural stop codon) and ficolin-β ((m)CATGP … VRLT*) were cloned into pET11 expression vectors as described for the tenascin fbg domain (22Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pig ficolin-α and -β cDNAs, kindly provided by Dr. Hidenori Ichijo, The Cancer Institute, Japan, were used as templates for polymerase chain reaction. Following expression in Escherichia coli, the ficolin fbg domains were entirely in the insoluble pellet of the bacterial lysate, as was TNfbg (22Aukhil I. Joshi P. Yan Y. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2542-2553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was washed twice with lysate buffer and then resuspended in 4 mguanidine HCl in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was dialyzed against 6m urea in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The protein was renatured by dialyzing slowly against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm reduced and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione. About 40% of the ficolin fbg protein was recovered in the soluble supernatant and was further purified by chromatography on a Mono Q column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), where it eluted at 0.24 mNaCl. However, gel filtration indicated that the final product was heterogeneous oligomers, and it did not bind the GlcNAc column, so it may not be properly folded. It was nevertheless suitable for making an antibody. For preparation of polyclonal antibody Ficα4325, a rabbit was immunized with 500 μg of purified ficolin-α fbg in complete Freund's agent, followed by four boosts of 250 μg in incomplete Freund's. Antisera were collected after the third and the fourth boosts. A similar antibody, Ficβ4326, was raised against pig ficolin-β fbg domain. IgG was purified from the ficolin-α antiserum by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (23Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 1988; : 298-305Google Scholar). About 20 mg of purified IgG was then cross-linked to 15 ml of Affi-Gel HZ (Bio-Rad). Pig plasma (100 ml, collected in 1% citrate) was brought to 30% saturated ammonium sulfate, left at room temperature for 1 h, and centrifuged at 11,100 × g, for 15 min. The precipitate was resuspended in 50 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, and passed over the antibody affinity column. The column was washed with 75 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer containing 0.15m NaCl, pH 8.0 (TBS), and eluted with 2 bed volumes of 0.2m glycine, pH 2.8. The elute was neutralized immediately with 1 m Tris and precipitated again with ammonium sulfate to concentrate. The pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0. 100 ml of citrated pig plasma was run over a 10-ml GlcNAc-agarose column (Sigma) that had been washed with TBS. The column was washed with 5 bed volumes of TBS and eluted with 2 bed volumes of TBS containing 0.15 m GlcNAc, and then 2 bed volumes of TBS containing 0.8 m GlcNAc. Fractions from the GlcNAc column were contaminated with anti-carbohydrate IgG and IgM, which were removed by a two-step final purification on a resource Q column (Pharmacia). The ficolin eluted from the GlcNAc column was dialyzed into Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and passed through a 1-ml resource Q column. Most ficolin and IgG were in the flow-through, whereas IgM bound to the column. The flow-through was diluted with 20 mm Tris buffer to give a final NaCl concentration of 0.1m and then passed through the column again to purify the ficolin. IgG was mostly in the flow-through, and ficolin eluted at 0.2–0.24 m NaCl, well separated from the IgG. SDS-PAGE was performed using standard techniques. For Western blots proteins were transferred to Immobilon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semi-dry electroblotter (Multiphor II, Pharmacia-LKB). Blots were stained with the polyclonal antiserum against pig ficolin-α, and developed with horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. The stokes radius (RS) of ficolin was estimated by gel filtration on a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia, 1 × 31 cm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution buffer was TBS, and the column was calibrated with standard proteins of known RS(thyroglobulin, 8.5 nm; aldolase, 4.81 nm; bovine serum albumin, 3.55 nm). The sedimentation coefficient was estimated by glycerol gradient sedimentation. The samples were sedimented on 15–40% glycerol gradients in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate at 32,000 rpm for 16 h in a Beckman SW-50.1 rotor. The glycerol gradients were calibrated with standard proteins of known S value (thyroglobulin, 19 S; catalase, 11.3 S; bovine serum albumin, 4.6 S). The molecular weight was estimated from combined gel filtration and gradient sedimentation using Equation 1 (24Hortsch M. Goodman C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15104-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mr=SN0(6πηRS)/(1−v2ρ)=4,204S′RS′Equation 1 where Mr is molecular weight,N0 is Avogadro's number, η is viscosity of the solvent (0.01 poise), v2 is partial specific volume of the protein (assumed to be 0.73 cm3/g), ρ is density of solvent (1.0). For the numerical formulation on the right S′ is in Svedberg units and RS′ is in nm. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis was performed with a Beckman XL-A analytic ultracentrifuge. Purified big and little ficolins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m NaCl, and centrifuged at 20 °C at 3,000 and 5,500 rpm. The protein gradient along the cell was monitored as absorbance at 235 or 230 nm. Typical times to reach equilibrium were 24 h for big ficolin and 18 h for little ficolin. A base line, corresponding to a few percent of total absorbance, was determined after centrifuging the samples at high speed and was subtracted from the measurements. The corrected absorbance profiles were fit to a single molecular species using software provided with the XL-A centrifuge. For rotary shadowing, samples from the glycerol gradient fractions were sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, dried in vacuum, and rotary shadowed with platinum (25Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For negative staining, a drop of protein was applied to a glow discharged carbon-coated grid, and 3 drops of 2% uranyl acetate were flushed over the grids. The last drop was dried with filter paper. The length and diameter measurements of stalk and globular domains were made on micrographs of negatively stained samples printed at 300,000 × magnification. The polyclonal antibody against pig ficolin-α fbg reacted strongly against the bacterial expressed pig ficolin-α fbg domain, and more weakly against the ficolin-β expression protein (the weak higher molecular weight bands in lanes 5 and6 are contaminating bacterial proteins reacting with our polyclonal antibody) (Fig. 1). This antibody also labeled a broad 35-kDa band in pig plasma. The ficolin in crude pig plasma migrated at a higher molecular weight than did ficolin from the ammonium sulfate cuts or the more purified fractions. The slower migration may be due to the large amount of protein loaded in these fractions. The bands in Fig. 1 appear more diffuse than in other preparations (but note that the higher concentration starting material in Figs. 4 and 5 are also diffuse). This probably reflects the larger amount of protein loaded here and an excess staining by the antibody. However, the ficolin bands are always rather diffuse in our preparations, and this has been noted in previous reports (2Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H.

The diffuseness of the ficolin bands may be partially due to glycosylation, since treatment with glycosidase was reported to sharpen the bands (2Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J.

Pig plasma ficolin was precipitated by 30% saturated ammonium sulfate (Fig. 1) and then purified on the ficolin-α antibody affinity column. Analysis by gel filtration and sedimentation indicated that this antibody purified ficolin was almost exclusively the big ficolin oligomer (see below). The antibody purified ficolin contained several contaminating bands when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (not shown).Figure 4Gel filtration chromatography of pig plasma ficolin.

Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we tested pig plasma ficolin for similar lectin activity. As shown in Fig. 2, pig plasma ficolin also bound to the GlcNAc column. We discovered that some of the ficolin eluted with 0.15 m GlcNAc, and a second fraction eluted at 0.8 m GlcNAc. The ficolin eluted from the column with GlcNAc was contaminated with proteins corresponding to immunoglobulin heavy and light chains, probably antibodies against carbohydrate epitopes. These contaminants were removed by chromatography on resource Q (Fig. 2 B). Western blot analysis indicated a variable fraction of the ficolin in plasma did not bind the GlcNAc column and was recovered in the flow-through. With two lots of pig plasma there was no binding of ficolin to the column, whereas with others 80–90% plasma ficolin bound to the column. ∼70% bound ficolin eluted at 0.15 mGlcNAc, and this was identified as big ficolin, as described below. The remainder eluted at 0.8 m GlcNAc and was identified as little ficolin. When run on non-reducing SDS-PAGE both big and little ficolins showed the same molecular mass of approximately 400 kDa (Fig.3). Antibody affinity purified ficolin also had the same molecular mass. On 12% acrylamide gels, non-reducing SDS-PAGE revealed a small fraction (10–20%) of monomeric 35-kDa ficolin, in addition to the 400-kDa band. We conclude that most of the ficolin is covalently cross-linked by disulfide bonds into 400-kDa oligomers (which correspond to a little ficolin oligomer, see below). Gel filtration chromatography on Superose 6 was used to analyze ficolin in whole plasma, as well as purified big and little ficolins (Fig.4). The ficolin peak from plasma eluted slightly ahead of thyroglobulin, at RS ∼10.5 nm (Fig.4 A). The GlcNAc affinity purified big ficolin eluted at the same RS (Fig. 4 B) as did the antibody purified ficolin (not shown). In contrast, purified little ficolin eluted later, at RS ∼7.3 nm (Fig.4 C). The same samples were analyzed by sedimentation on glycerol gradients (Fig. 5). Purified big ficolin sedimented as a sharp peak at 19.5 S and purified little ficolin sedimented at 12 S (Fig.5, B and C). The ratio of these sedimentation coefficients to those of unhydrated spherical proteins of the same mass was 1.7 (f/fmin = 1.7), which is characteristic of moderately elongated proteins (26Erickson H.P. Biophys. J. 1982; 37: 96Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ficolin in whole plasma sedimented as a very broad peak. There was substantial ficolin at the 19.5 S position of purified big ficolin and none at the position of little ficolin, but the majority of ficolin in plasma sedimented faster in a broad peak. This sedimentation implies that the ficolin in plasma is in the form of big ficolin oligomers and larger aggregates. These larger aggregates were not obvious on the gel filtration, perhaps because big ficolin itself elutes close to the void volume. The RS estimated from gel filtration and the S from gradient sedimentation were used to estimate the mass of native ficolins using the Svedberg equation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Big ficolin (860,000 Da) was approximately twice the size of little ficolin (368,000 Da) (Table I).Table IHydrodynamic analysis of big and little ficolinsRSSMr(S-M)Mr (sed eq)Big ficolin10.519.5861,000827,000Little ficolin7.312368,000387,000RS was determined from gel filtration (Fig. 4), and S from sedimentation in glycerol gradients (Fig. 5). TheMr (S–M) was calculated from RSand S as described by Siegel and Monte (24Hortsch M. Goodman C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15104-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the formula given under “Experimental Procedures.” The last column,Mr (sed eq), was determined by sedimentation equilibrium (Fig. 6) and is the most rigorous determination of mass. The 827,000 mass of big ficolin is the most reliable estimate. Open table in a new tab RS was determined from gel filtration (Fig. 4), and S from sedimentation in glycerol gradients (Fig. 5). TheMr (S–M) was calculated from RSand S as described by Siegel and Monte (24Hortsch M. Goodman C.S. J. Biol.

The 827,000 mass of big ficolin is the most reliable estimate. A more rigorous estimate of the mass was obtained by sedimentation equilibrium of purified big and little ficolin. Computer-derived curves based on the assumption of a homogeneous single species gave excellent fits for both samples (Fig. 6). Big ficolin fit a mass of 827,000 Da and little ficolin 387,000 Da (Table I). For technical reasons the value obtained for big ficolin is considered more reliable. We conclude that big ficolin is a dimer of little ficolins. Electron microscopy of rotary shadowed ficolin revealed several structural variations of both big and little ficolins (Fig.7). Big ficolin typically appears as a large central cluster, rectangular in profile, with two small globes projecting at opposite sides (Fig. 7, A and B). More disrupted structures are occasionally seen (Fig. 7, C–G), as well as some larger aggregates (Fig. 7 H). Little ficolin frequently appeared as a parachute-like structure that closely resembled half a big ficolin as follows: a large cluster at one end corresponding to half the central cluster of large ficolin, with a single small globe extended from it (Fig. 7, I–M). The most revealing images are those in which the large cluster appears to be disrupted, with one to four globular domains separated out (Fig. 7, J–M). These are connected to the small globe by thin rods that are only sometimes visible. We conclude that the basic structure of little ficolin comprises four globular domains on the end of long thin rods, with all four rods connected into the small globe at the other end (Fig.7 I). Interpretive drawings of the images are given in Fig.10.Figure 10Schematic diagrams of big and little ficolins matching electron micrographs. Each trimeric unit is represented by a lollipop structure, whose rod is the collagen triple helix and whose large globular domain contains the three fbg domains. Four of these are bonded at the N-terminal domain to make little ficolin (A–E), and two little ficolins are joined at the fbg domains to make a big ficolin (F–I). Molecules are shown in various states of disruption to model the images seen by electron microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electron micrographs of negatively stained big ficolin (Fig.8) confirmed the structures seen with rotary shadowing (Fig. 7, A and B) and provide higher resolution images of the globular domains and rods. The central cluster appeared more compact in the negatively stained images, suggesting partial disruption when molecules are dried on mica. The small globes are quite visible, as are some of the thin rods linking them to the central cluster. We have generally found negative stain to give the most reliable high resolution structural information, and our measurements are mostly taken from these. The most accurate number, because it is the largest, is the total length from the outside of the two small globes, which is 40 nm. Each small globe is about 3 nm in diameter, and the central cluster measures 10 nm along the axis connecting the small globes, and is 13 nm wide. This leaves 12 nm for the rods measured from the surface of the small globe to the central cluster. We were not able to identify partially disrupted ficolins in negative stain, but rotary shadowed images showing globular domains separated from the central cluster indicated a diameter of 9 nm, after subtracting 2 nm for the shell of metal. We tested the ability of purified ficolin to bind the GlcNAc affinity column after dialyzing them into different buffers. The results were surprising. First, we found that ficolin that had been purified by antibody affinity, which sedimented like big ficolin, did not bind the GlcNAc column at all. Second, we found that GlcNAc affinity purified big ficolin also would not rebind, regardless of the buffer. However, purified little ficolin did rebind and could be eluted again by 0.8m GlcNAc. Matsushita et al. (5Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2448-2454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) reported that the lectin activity of ficolin required calcium, but our initial binding results were obtained with citrated plasma, which should have chelated the calcium. To test this further we dialyzed purified little ficolin into buffer containing 5 mm calcium or 10 mm EDTA. The ficolin bound to the GlcNAc column in both buffers, suggesting that calcium was not necessary for the lectin activity. We made several attempts to convert little ficolin into large and visa versa. The addition of 0.8 m GlcNAc to purified big ficolin or to plasma did not change the gel filtration pattern of ficolin. Little ficolin was not detected in native plasma, but only after passing it over the GlcNAc column, so it appears to have been generated on the column. Once generated, however, it appears to be quite stable, with no tendency to re-assemble into big ficolin. The sedimentation equilibrium analyses were done 2 weeks after the purification, demonstrating the long term stability of the two forms. Our model of ficolin is shown schematically in Figs.9 and 10. The basic structural unit is a trimer, comprising a thin collagen-like rod with globular domains projecting at each end. Four trimeric units are joined at the small N-terminal domains to form a little ficolin oligomer. The larger C-terminal fbg domains cluster at the other end of the collagen rod. Two little ficolins join face to face at these fbg domains to form a big ficolin, which has 24 subunits. The model agrees well with the 827,000 Da mass we measured for big ficolin. With 24 subunits the mass per subunit should be 34,458. Mature pig ficolin-α consists of 297 amino acids making a polypeptide chain of 32,044 Da ((2) but N-terminal amino acid microsequencing showed the mature peptide to begin at LDT (7Harumiya S. Takeda K. Sugiura T. Fukumoto Y. Tachikawa H. Miyazono K. Fujimoto D. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). There are threeN-linked glycosylation sites in pig ficolin-α, one of which is conserved in all ficolins. The 34,458 Da estimated for the native subunit is 2,400 Da larger than the mass of the polypeptide, which is about the mass that would be added by a single carbohydrate cluster. The amino acid sequence of ficolin indicates three independently folding domains (2Ichijo H. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez L.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14505-14513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Matsushita M. Endo Y. Taira S. Sato Y. Fujita T. Ichikawa N. Nakata M. Mizuochi T. J. Biol.

( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The middle domain is most important for the structure. The 54 amino acid segment (GCPG … KGES) comprises 28 collagen-like GX Y repeats, which presumably form a three-stranded collagen helix. This collagen rod should have a length of 15.4 nm, based on the 0.286 nm/amino acid distance in the collagen triple helix (17Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thin collagen rods are scarcely visible in the electron micrographs, but it is clear that the 15.4 nm collagen rod is much longer than the 12 nm distance between the small and large globular domains. We conclude that the globular domains fold back over the collagen rod and that the termini of this rod are buried within them (Fig. 9). On the N-terminal side of the collagen domain are the first 25 amino acids (APAL … SILR), which probably contribute to a small globular domain. Our electron micrographs show the four collagen rods connected at the small 3-nm globe (see Fig. 10 for schematic drawings). We conclude that the N-terminal segments of the 12 subunits are joined in this domain. Since ficolin, SP-D and conglutinin all have a small N-terminal domain that makes tetramers of collagen-based trimers, we looked for similarities. The N-terminal sequences of SP-D and conglutinin were 65% identical to each other, but only 20 and 25% are identical to ficolin. Even this limited sequence identity suggests that these proteins may share a common structural motif for bonding the 12 subunits, but this structure is not known for any of them. The C-terminal 221 amino acids (WETE … FRAT) form the fbg domain (the first few amino acids do not align with fbg domains of other proteins, and may be a spacer). The fbg domain from γ-fibrinogen has recently been resolved at atomic resolution by x-ray diffraction, and it measures 3.8 × 4.4 × 5.6 nm (21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Each collagen rod will carry three fbg domains at its end, which together should measure about 5.6 × 8 nm (Fig. 9 A). This would correspond to the ∼9-nm globular domains seen in disrupted molecules (the rotary shadowing may exaggerate the diameter). The ∼10-nm thickness of the central cluster could accommodate the face to face junction of two domains along the long axis (Fig. 9 C). It is more of a challenge to fit four of these trimeric units, each about 8 nm across, into the 13-nm width of the central cluster. However, if the trimeric units are rotated to achieve maximum packing of the 12 fbg domains, they will just about fit into a 13-nm wide cluster. Our speculative model for this packing is shown in Fig. 9 B. The central cluster of big ficolin appears to involve the face to face fusion of the fbg domains from two little ficolins. This fusion is apparently non-covalent, since non-reducing SDS-PAGE gives the same 400-kDa mass for both little and big ficolin. What is the disulfide bonding arrangement? There are two cysteines in the N-terminal domain (one is actually the second residue of the collagen rod, which we conclude is buried in the globular domain) available for disulfide cross-linking. It is difficult to imagine that these two cysteines could form a network of disulfides linking all 12 subunits. There are two additional cysteines in the C-terminal domain that could be involved in inter-chain disulfides, one just before and one within the fbg domain (we ignore the four cysteines making internal disulfides within fbg (21Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Côté H.C.F. Le Trong I. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar)). A useful analogy may be seen in SP-D, which also has two cysteines in the N-terminal domain but has no others available for inter-chain disulfides. On non-reducing SDS-PAGE SP-D shows trimers, probably two subunits from one collagen-linked trimer and one from another one (17Crouch E. Persson A. Chang D. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17311-17319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We speculate that the two cysteines in the N-terminal domain are sufficient to form trimers, as in SP-D, but the C-terminal cysteines of ficolin may be necessary to link all 12 subunits into a single unit. It seems likely that the lectin activity and other binding functions are in the fbg domain, so the structure of big ficolin raises a question. Why would these binding domains be buried in the center of the molecule? We suggest this may be a control mechanism. Concealed binding activity is actually consistent with our observation that big ficolin binds only weakly to the GlcNAc column and loses its affinity completely after elution and dialysis. In contrast, we observed that little ficolin bound tightly to the GlcNAc column, which is consistent with the full exposure of its 12 fbg domains, permitting multiple attachments of a single molecule. It is possible that the initial binding of big ficolin was due to partially disrupted molecules with only one or two fbg domains exposed (Fig. 10, G, H, andI) and that after purification these re-associate to the fully closed molecule (Fig. 10 F). The transition to fully active little ficolin may occur in steps. We only detected little ficolin after interaction with the GlcNAc column, so it is possible that contact with the column caused the formation of the active little ficolin. We can only speculate on the source of the little ficolin. Native ficolin in plasma is mostly big ficolin and larger aggregates. A certain fraction of the big ficolins may be partially disrupted, extending one or two arms to make a partially active form. This would probably be reversible, the molecule returning to the fully closed form in the absence of outside forces. But if one of these extended arms did bind a ligand, this could trap that arm and prevent re-folding. The trapped ficolin could then become further disrupted, leading to additional trapped arms and eventually a fully active little ficolin. This could be particularly attractive as a mechanism for binding a multivalent ligand like a bacterial surface. Ficolin was originally identified as a transforming growth factor β binding protein (1Ichijo H. Ronnstrand L. Miyagawa K. Ohashi H. Heldin C.-H. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22459-22464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but this binding activity has not been confirmed for recombinant ficolin or for plasma ficolin. Plasma ficolin has been reported to bind elastin and gelatin (7Harumiya S. Takeda K. Sugiura T. Fukumoto Y. Tachikawa H. Miyazono K. Fujimoto D. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and corticosteroids (3Edgar P.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 159-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We would predict that these binding activities are in the fbg domains and that they will be differentially activated in big and little ficolin.

PTHrP mRNA was expressed as early as 1 h by the addition of KCl to a final concentration of 25 mm to the culture medium. This expression was induced by Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels and regulated at the transcriptional step. PTHrP mRNA was persistently expressed before and after the time of commitment of granule neurons to apoptosis when they are cultured in the presence of 25 mmKCl or both 150 μm N-methyl-d-aspartic acid and 15 mmKCl, both of which promote the survival of these neurons.

Cerebellar granule neurons gradually undergo apoptosis within a few days after their inoculation into a culture medium containing 5 mm KCl.

The structural similarity of PTHrP to parathyroid hormone (PTH) is confined to the amino-terminal 32 amino acid residues that interact with the PTH/PTHrP receptor and exert their functions through adenylate cyclase- and phospholipase C-mediated pathways (13Abou-Samra A.-B.

PTHrP is expressed in a large variety of tissues including the central nervous system, heart, pancreas, adrenal glands, smooth muscle, lactating mammary tissue, bladder, skin, and pregnant uterus (18Daifotis A.G.

In situ hybridization studies have revealed that in the central nervous system PTHrP mRNA and its receptor mRNA are localized in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and neuroendocrine cells (19Weir E.C.

Although its abundance and specific localization in the central nervous system may suggest that PTHrP must have some specific functions in the nervous system, a little has been elucidated about the biological functions of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor and regulation of the genes encoding them in neurons (19Weir E.C.

Here we report on activity-dependent regulation of the expression of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor and the involvement of PTHrP in the activity-dependent survival of cerebellar granule neurons. Cerebellar granule neurons were cultured according to the method of Levi et al. (22Levi G. Aloisi F. Ciotti M.T. Thangnipon W. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Shahar A. Vellis J. Habu B.A. Dissection and Tissue Culture Manual of the Nervous System. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 211-214Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cerebella were dissected from 8-day-old rats and incubated in 1% trypsin (Worthington) for 20 min at 37 °C. The trypsinized tissue was triturated with a Pasteur pipette until no tissue aggregates were seen. Then the cells were washed with Eagle's basal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated plastic dishes at a density of 2.6 × 105cells/cm2 unless otherwise stated in Eagle's basal medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. At 24 h after plating, the medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing 100 μm cytosine arabinoside and various reagents as described below. In some cases 30 μm (±)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5) was added to the culture medium simultaneously with KCl for prevention of potential effects of glutamate, which might have been present in the fetal calf serum and/or released from the granule neurons, on the survival of granule neurons. The cell survival was assayed by the MTT method as described by Mosmann (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46809) Google Scholar). A one-tenth volume of 5 mg/ml MTT solution dissolved in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline was added to the culture. Then the dish was returned to the incubator and incubated for a further 2–3 h. An equal volume of isopropyl alcohol containing 0.08 n HCl was then added for dissolution of the formazan dye. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured with that at 630 nm as a reference. Total cellular RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63223) Google Scholar). RNA was separated on a 1% formaldehyde agarose gel and then transferred to Biodyne B membrane (Pall). The 0.24–9.5-kb RNA ladder (Life Technologies) was used as a size marker. A cDNA probe was labeled with random 9-mers (Takara) and [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After hybridization, the membrane was washed with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature followed by washing with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C. The same filters were reprobed with the cDNA for mouse glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for verification of equivalent loading of RNAs (25Inokuchi K. Kato A. Hiraia K. Hishinuma F. Inoue M. Ozawa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the mRNAs were normalized to that of G6PDH mRNA according to the results of densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms. The PTH/PTHrP receptor probe was generated by PCR with specific primers and rat kidney cDNA. The sequence of the sense primer was 5′-AGC GCA AAG CAC GAA GTG GGA-3′, and that of the antisense primer was 5′-CCA TGT GCC CAG GCC AGC AG-3′ (26Ureña P. Kong X.-F. Abou-Samra A.-B. Jüppner H. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Segre G.V. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). With these primers, a 369-base pair product, which corresponds to amino acid residues 488–610 of the rat PTH/PTHrP receptor, was generated. Differential display was carried out by the method of Liang et al. (27Liang L. Averboukh L. Pardee B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) and Inokuchi et al. (25Inokuchi K. Kato A. Hiraia K. Hishinuma F. Inoue M. Ozawa F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured cerebellar granule neurons as described above. Six μg of total RNA was treated with 4 units of RNase-free DNase I (Life Technologies; amplification grade) in the presence of 48 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Takara) in a total volume of 40 μl. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in water. A 0.5-μg aliquot of the DNase I-treated RNA was heat-denatured at 70 °C for 5 min and quenched on ice. The reverse transcription was carried out at 35 °C for 60 min with 300 units of Super ScriptTM II RNase H−reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies), 20 μm dNTP, 40 units of ribonuclease inhibitor, and 2.5 μm of anchor primer (either T12VA, T12VG, T12VT, or T12VC (where V is a mixture of A, G, and C)) in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and the cDNA product was stored at −80 °C until use. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in a siliconized tube containing a 0.5-μl aliquot of the cDNA solution, 2.0 μm dNTP, 3.1 μCi of [α-35S]dCTP (1,200 Ci/mmol, Amersham), 1.0 μm anchor primer, 0.5 μm arbitrary 10-mer, and 0.63 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Toyobo) in a total volume of 5.0 μl. The cycle conditions were as follows: 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 40 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. The differentially displayed bands were extracted from the sequencing gel and reamplified as described by Liang et al. (27Liang L. Averboukh L. Pardee B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Positive clones were selected by screening by Northern blotting analysis and sequenced with a Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (Amersham). For immunostaining of primary cultured granule neurons, the granule neurons were cultured on eight-well slides precoated with poly-d-lysine. The slides were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline twice, after which the cells on the slides were fixed overnight at 4 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Then after the cells were permeabilized for 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum, they were incubated with anti-PTHrP antibody (10 μg/ml IgG, Oncogene PC09) for 2 h at room temperature. Then the slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline three times followed by repermeabilization of the cells for 15 min and incubation of the repermeabilized cells with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. Preabsorbed antibody was used for staining negative control preparations. The PTHrP concentration in the culture medium was determined by use of a PTHrP radioimmunometric assay kit (Mitsubishi Kagaku Co., Japan) with human PTHrP-(1–137) as a standard, according to the manufacturer's instructions. This kit contains a monoclonal anti-human PTHrP-(1–34) antibody conjugated to polystyrene beads and a polyclonal anti-human PTHrP-(50–83) antibody. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217316) Google Scholar) by use of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine γ-globulin as a standard. Synthetic rat PTHrP-(1–34) amide was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan), and rabbit anti-rat PTHrP-(1–34) antiserum was purchased from Yanaihara Institute Inc. (Sizuoka, Japan). All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were purchased from local pharmaceutical companies. Cerebellar granule neurons undergo apoptosis during culture in the presence of 5 mm KCl. In the presence of 25 mm KCl or both 150 μm NMDA and 15 mm KCl, this apoptosis of the granule neurons is inhibited. To characterize this apoptosis, we determined the commitment time to apoptosis of the granule neurons. The granule neurons were cultured in the presence of 5 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5, or 15 mm KCl. At 24-h intervals, KCl or NMDA was added to a final concentration of 25 mm or 150 μm, respectively, for rescue of the cells, and the cell survival was assayed at 5.0 days in vitro (DIV). As shown in Fig. 1, 50% protection of the apoptosis was observed at 3.0 DIV under both sets of conditions, and no significant difference in the time of commitment to apoptosis was observed between these two sets of conditions. Thus, the commitment time to apoptosis under these conditions was 3.0 DIV. To identify activity-dependent genes whose expression is up-regulated at around the time of commitment to apoptosis, we used an mRNA differential display technique. At 2.5 and 3.5 DIV, i.e. just before and after the time of commitment to apoptosis, total cellular RNA was harvested from the granule neurons cultured under nondepolarizing conditions (culture medium containing 5 mmKCl and 30 μm AP-5) and depolarizing conditions (culture medium containing 15 mm KCl and 150 μm NMDA). These RNA samples were used as templates for PCR after they were reverse-transcribed to cDNA. We used various combinations of 10 arbitrary primers and 4 anchor primers in the PCR and detected 21 differentially displayed bands on the sequencing gels (data not shown). Among these bands, one of the most strongly displayed was chosen for further analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the bands indicated with an arrow were detected in the lanes that were loaded with the PCR products derived from cells cultured under the depolarizing conditions (lanes B) but not in those loaded with the PCR products derived from the cells cultured under the nondepolarizing conditions (lanes A). One of these bands was cut out from the gel, and the cDNA fragment was extracted and reamplified. The product of this amplification was cloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector and sequenced in its entirety. It was found to consist of 324 base pairs, and its sequence was found to be identical to a part of the sequence that had been published for rat PTHrP cDNA sequence (29Yasuda T. Banville D.L. Rabbani S.A. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A full-length PTHrP cDNA was obtained by screening of a λ ZapII library that had been constructed from the RNA extracted from the granule neurons cultured for 5.0 DIV in the medium containing 15 mm KCl and 150 μm NMDA. The cDNA sequence of this clone was found to be 100% identical to that of the PTHrP cDNA reported previously (29Yasuda T. Banville D.L. Rabbani S.A. Hendy G.N. Goltzman D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Differential expression of the PTHrP mRNA under the nondepolarizing conditions and depolarizing conditions was confirmed by Northern blotting analysis (Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of PTHrP mRNA is associated with activity-dependent survival of cerebellar granule neurons. A, Northern blotting analysis of PTHrP mRNA expression in granule neurons. Either 20 μg (lanes labeled2.5 DIV and 4.5 DIV) or 10 μg (lanes labeled 5.5 DIV and 6.5 DIV) of total RNA extracted from the granule neurons cultured in the presence of 5 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5; 15 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5; 25 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5; or 15 mm KCl, 150 μm NMDA was subjected to Northern blotting analysis. The Sac II/Xba I fragment of the full-length PTHrP cDNA was used as a probe. At 5.5 DIV, 300 μm AP-5 (asterisk) was added to the cultures in the presence of 150 μm NMDA, 15 mm KCl for induction of apoptosis. Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was extracted and subjected to Northern blotting analysis (lane labeled 6.5 DIV, AP-5, +*). The same volume of water was added to the control culture (lane labeled 6.5 DIV, AP-5(−)). The bottom panel shows the expression levels of G6PDH mRNA.

The granule neurons were cultured for 4.5 days in the medium containing 15 mm KCl, 150 μm NMDA, and then NMDA receptor was blocked by the addition of AP-5 to a final concentration of 300 μm. Total RNA was extracted at the indicated times, and 10-μg aliquots of it were subjected to Northern blotting analysis.

To clarify the relationship between the survival rate of the granule neurons and the expression of PTHrP mRNA, we carried out Northern blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the expression of the 1.4-kb PTHrP mRNA could already be detected at 2.5 DIV in the case of cultures under the survival-promoting conditions (25 mmKCl, 30 μm AP-5 or 150 μm NMDA, 15 mm KCl). Its level in both the survival-promoting conditions increased to 4.0 times that at 2.5 DIV by 4.5 DIV. An additional minor transcript of 3.0 kb was also expressed under these survival-promoting conditions. This expression of the PTHrP mRNAs was confined mainly to the survival-promoting conditions; little of it was detected in the case of culture under the apoptosis-inducing conditions (5 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5 or 15 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5). Thus, before the time of commitment to apoptosis and thereafter, the expression of PTHrP mRNA was up-regulated, when the cells were cultured under the survival-promoting conditions, while little PTHrP mRNA expression was detected in the case of culture under apoptosis-inducing conditions. The addition of AP-5 to a final concentration of 300 μm to the NMDA-supported culture at 5.5 DIV resulted in induction of apoptosis within 12 h, and approximately 50% of the cells died within 24 h. 2T. Ono and S. Kawashime, unpublished data. Within these 24 h the expression of PTHrP was down-regulated to approximately 13% of the control level (Fig. 3 A, lane labeled6.5 DIV and AP-5(−)) by inducing the apoptosis. The down-regulation of PTHrP mRNA expression was induced at between 2 and 5 h after the addition of AP-5 (Fig. 3 B), and the level of PTHrP mRNA was reduced to 8.9% of the initial level within 10 h after the addition of AP-5. The expression of PTHrP mRNA was also down-regulated within 24 h after the culture medium containing 25 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5 was exchanged with a fresh one containing 5 mm KCl (data not shown). To confirm the expression of PTHrP in the granule neurons, we carried out immunofluorescence staining with anti-PTHrP antibody (Fig.4). Abundant PTHrP immunoreactivity was detected in the granule neurons cultured under the survival-promoting conditions (25 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5 or 15 mm KCl, 150 μm NMDA). The immunoreactivity was localized in the somata and neurites. In the somata both the perinuclear region and the nucleus were stained, although the former was stained more strongly than the latter. The PTHrP immunofluorescence in the cells cultured under the apoptosis-inducing conditions (5 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5 or 15 mm KCl, 30 μmAP-5) was extremely weak, which is in good agreement with the expression pattern of PTHrP mRNA in the cells cultured under these conditions. No staining was obtained in negative control preparations (data not shown). Thus, both PTHrP mRNA and its protein product were expressed in an activity-dependent manner in the granule neurons. In an attempt to elucidate the expression mechanism of PTHrP mRNA in an activity-dependent manner, we studied the time course of PTHrP mRNA expression in the granule neurons. Stimulation with 25 mm KCl at 1.0 DIV resulted in no significant up-regulation of PTHrP mRNA expression within 5 h, suggesting that the expression is dependent on the maturation of the granule neurons. Therefore, we decided to use more mature neurons. The granule neurons were cultured in the presence of 25 mm KCl for 4 days, and then the medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing 5 mm KCl. The culture was continued for 24 h for down-regulation of PTHrP mRNA expression. Then the cells were stimulated with the reagents as shown in Fig.5 A. PTHrP mRNA was expressed as early as 1 h after the start of stimulation with 25 mm KCl or 150 μm NMDA, 15 mm KCl. An approximately 10-fold increase in the level of the expression compared with the expression level at 1 h had occurred within 5 h after the start of the stimulation with 25 mm KCl or 150 μm NMDA, 15 mm KCl. Hardly any PTHrP mRNA expression was detectable in both the cells cultured in the presence of 5 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5 and those cultured in the presence of 15 mm KCl, 30 μm AP-5. Fig.5 B shows the effects of nifedipine, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide on the expression of PTHrP mRNA. The addition of nifedipine 30 min before the addition of 25 mm KCl resulted in complete inhibition of the expression of PTHrP mRNA. This result suggests that Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels was required for the up-regulation of the PTHrP mRNA expression in these cells. Actinomycin D inhibited completely the up-regulation of PTHrP mRNA expression induced by 25 mm KCl, suggesting that the expression of PTHrP mRNA is regulated at the transcriptional step. The addition of cycloheximide alone to the 5 mm KCl-containing culture induced no PTHrP mRNA expression. Moreover, cycloheximide did not inhibit the expression of PTHrP mRNA induced by 25 mm KCl, indicating that the expression of PTHrP mRNA was independent of translation. These results suggest that the Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels positively regulates PTHrP mRNA transcription. It has been suggested that PTHrP is secreted from non-neuronal cells and endocrine cells and functions as an autocrine and/or a paracrine factor in those cells (30Plawner L.L. Philbrick W.M. Burtis W.J. Broadus A.E. Stewart A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14078-14084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that PTHrP was secreted from the cerebellar granule neurons into the culture medium only when they are cultured under the survival-promoting conditions (Fig. 6 A). This secretion was first detected after 2.0 DIV, and its level increased linearly thereafter, which is in good agreement with the PTHrP mRNA expression pattern (Fig. 3 A). To see if this secretion is depolarization-dependent, we stimulated the granule neurons with 55 mm KCl after exchanging the culture medium with the one containing 5 mm KCl. We used 55 mm KCl rather than 25 mm to ensure complete depolarization of the neurons. Secretion of PTHrP was induced within 30 s after stimulation with KCl, and the PTHrP concentration in the culture medium became almost constant within 2 min (Fig. 6 B). Thus, PTHrP is secreted via a depolarization-dependently regulated pathway. Since in the radioimmunometric assay for quantitation of the secreted PTHrP we used an antibody that recognizes theN-terminal region (1Oppenheim R.W. Annu. Rev.

https://openalex.org/W2052447181,"Abstract The amino-terminal domain of each integrin β subunit is hypothesized to contain an ion binding site that is key to cell adhesion. A new hypothesis regarding the structure of this site is suggested by the crystallization of the I domains of the integrin αL and αM subunits (Lee, J.-O., Rieu, P., Arnaout, M. A., and Liddington, R. (1995) Cell 80, 631–638; Qu, A., and Leahy, D. J. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 10277–10281). In those proteins, an essential metal ion is bound by a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS). The MIDAS is presented at the apex of a larger protein module called an I domain. The metal ligands in the MIDAS can be separated into three distantly spaced clusters of oxygenated residues. These three coordination sites also appear to exist in the integrin β3 and β5 subunits. Here, we examined the putative metal binding site within β3 and β5 using site-directed mutagenesis and ligand binding studies. We also investigated the fold of the domain containing the putative metal binding site using the PHD structural algorithm. The results of the study point to the similarity between the integrin β subunits and the MIDAS motif at two of three key coordination points. Importantly though, the study failed to identify a residue in either β subunit that corresponds to the second metal coordination group in the MIDAS. Moreover, structural algorithms indicate that the fold of the β subunits is considerably different than the I domains. Thus, the integrin β subunits appear to present a MIDAS-like motif in the context of a protein module that is structurally distinct from known I domains."
https://openalex.org/W2069312788,"The expression of the prolactin receptor is under the control of two putative tissue-specific (PI, gonads; PII, liver) and one common (PIII) promoters (Hu, Z. Z., Zhuang, L., and Dufau, M. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 10242–10246). The three promoter regions were co-localized to the rat chromosomal locus 2ql6, in the order 5′-PIII-PI-PII-3′. To investigate the mechanisms of gonad-specific utilization of PI, the promoter domain, regulatory cis-elements, and trans-factors were identified in gonadal cells. The promoter domain localized to the 152-base pair 5′ of the transcriptional start site at −549 is highly active in gonadal cells but has minimal activity in hepatoma cells. It contains a steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) element (−668) that binds the SF-1 protein of nuclear extracts from gonadal cells and is essential for promoter activation. A CCAAT box (−623) contributes minimally to basal activity in the absence of the SF-1 element, and two adjacent TATA-like sequences act as inhibitory elements. Thus, PI belongs to a class of TATA-less/non-initiator gene promoters. These findings demonstrate an essential role for SF-1 in transcriptional activation of promoter I of the prolactin receptor gene, which may explain the tissue-specific expression of PI in the gonads but not in the liver and the mammary gland. The expression of the prolactin receptor is under the control of two putative tissue-specific (PI, gonads; PII, liver) and one common (PIII) promoters (Hu, Z. Z., Zhuang, L., and Dufau, M. L. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 10242–10246). The three promoter regions were co-localized to the rat chromosomal locus 2ql6, in the order 5′-PIII-PI-PII-3′. To investigate the mechanisms of gonad-specific utilization of PI, the promoter domain, regulatory cis-elements, and trans-factors were identified in gonadal cells.

Thus, PI belongs to a class of TATA-less/non-initiator gene promoters. These findings demonstrate an essential role for SF-1 in transcriptional activation of promoter I of the prolactin receptor gene, which may explain the tissue-specific expression of PI in the gonads but not in the liver and the mammary gland. The functional diversity of prolactin, involving lactation and reproduction, growth and metabolism, immune regulation, behavior, and homeostasis, has been well documented in the past several decades (2Nicoll C.S. Knobil E. Saywer W.H. Handbook of Physiology.American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C. 1974; 4: 253-292Google Scholar,3Doppler W. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 124: 94-130Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of prolactin receptors present in specific target tissues have only recently been investigated. Prolactin receptors are widely expressed, and multiple mRNA transcripts corresponding to the long and short forms of the receptor are present with various proportions in different tissues (4Hu Z.Z. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,5Nagano M. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13337-13345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diverse actions of prolactin could be manifested by the expression of different receptor forms and signal transduction pathways and also by differential control of gene transcription and mRNA regulation of PRLR 1The abbreviations used are: PRLR, prolactin receptor; SF-1, steroidogenic factor-1; 5′-RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pairs; kb, kilobase(s); DTT, dithiothreitol; LUC, luciferase; MLTC, mouse Leydig tumor cells; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; TSS, transcriptional start site; Adv, adenovirus. in target tissues. Recently, the complexity of the mechanism by which the PRLR gene is controlled was revealed by the demonstration of multiple and tissue-specific promoters of the rat prolactin receptor gene (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Three putative promoters PI, PII, and PIII that initiate the transcription of alternative first exons E11, E12, and E13, respectively, were identified in the rat gonads and the liver. The three alternate first exons are alternatively spliced to a common noncoding exon 2 that precedes the third exon containing the translation initiation codon of the prolactin receptor. E11is expressed in ovaries and in Leydig cells, E12 in the liver, and E13 in all three tissues, indicating that PI is gonad-specific, PII is liver-specific, and PIII is a common promoter for the prolactin receptor in these tissues and is the sole promoter utilized in the rat mammary gland (our current study). The various prolactin receptor forms were found not to be dependent on the utilization of individual promoters, which may result from a post-transcriptionally regulated process. However, these accounted for the 5′-untranslated region heterogeneity of the first exons of the PRLR mRNA transcripts (E11, E12, and E13) (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of the 5′-untranslated region of the PRLR transcripts was also reported recently in the gonads and the liver by others (6Moldrup A. Ormandy C. Nagano M. Murthy K. Banville D. Tronche F. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 661-671PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rubtsov P.M. Lonina D.A. Mol. Biol. ( Moscow ). 1996; 30: 193-198Google Scholar). Sequence analyses of 5′-flanking regions showed a lack of consensus TATA box sequences positioned within the expected distance from the transcriptional start site (TSS) in all three putative promoter regions (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, potentially functional non-canonical TATA box sequences are present in these regions, and in PI two adjacent TATA-like sequences reside 10 and 23 bp 5′ from the TSS. In addition, consensus sequences for several transcription factors are also present in these promoters, specifically SF-1, C/EBP, and CAAT box in PI; GATA-1, ERE and AP-1 in PII; and GAGA, GATA-1 and AABS in PIII. Therefore, it is assumed that different transcription factors and other cellular and extracellular regulators may be involved in the control and regulation of the PRLR gene in diverse target tissues. In the present study, we have determined the co-localization and the relative orientation of the three 5′-untranslated region/promoter regions in the rat chromosome, and we have investigated the underlying mechanisms of the tissue-specific promoter control of the PRLR gene in the gonads by the characterization of the gonad-specific promoter domain PI and its relevant cis-elements and trans-factors. These studies have demonstrated that steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (8Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar), also known as Ad4BP (9Honda S. Morohashi K. Nomura M. Takeya H. Kitajima M. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7494-7502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is an essential transcriptional activator of PI in testicular and ovarian cells. Such regulation by SF-1 appears to determine the specific gonadal utilization of promoter I. Adult male, prepubertal female, and lactating Harlan Sprague Dawley rats (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were housed in pathogen-free, temperature- and light-controlled conditions (20 °C; alternating light-dark cycle with 14 h of light and 10 h of darkness; lights on at 0600 h). The animals were given free access to tap water and standard Purina lab chow (Ralston-Purina, St. Louis, MO). All animals were killed between 1000 and 1100 h by asphyxiation with CO2. All animal studies were approved by the NICHD Animal Care and Use Committee (protocols 94-040 and 94-041). 40-day-old adult male rats were used for preparation of Leydig cells. 24-day-old immature female rats were injected subcutaneously daily for 3 days with 1.5 mg/day 17β-estradiol (dissolved in propylene glycol) (Sigma). On the 4th day, the animals were sacrificed for preparation of ovarian granulosa cells. The mammary gland of lactating female rats were resected and freed of surrounding adipose tissue and used for mRNA preparation. Cultures of mouse Leydig tumor cells (MLTC-1), a stable steroidogenic cell line that expresses prolactin and luteinizing hormone receptors (kindly provided by Dr. R. V. Rebois, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), were maintained in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 × antibiotic/antimycotic mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the human hepatoma cell line (HepG2, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD), which expresses prolactin receptors, was maintained in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. Rat ovarian granulosa cells were prepared from estrogen-primed rat ovaries as described previously (10Sirois J. Simmons D.L. Richards J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11586-11592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the ovaries were removed and cleared of the surrounding fat tissues. These were washed in Medium 199 (M199, BioWhittaker) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (Medium A), and punctured 20 times with a 23-gauge needle in Medium B (Medium A with additional 6.8 mm EGTA) followed by incubation in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 10 min and centrifugation at 700 rpm for 10 min. The ovaries were then incubated with Medium C (Medium A with additional 1.8 mm EGTA and 0.5 msucrose) for 6 min in CO2 incubator at 37 °C and centrifuged as above. To disperse the granulosa cells, the ovaries were pressed against a 40-mesh metal sieve with a spatula, and the dispersed cells were collected. The cells were treated with trypsin (Sigma) (20 mg/ml) for 1 min at 37 °C followed by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) (300 μg/ml) and DNase I (Sigma) (100 μg/ml) for 4 min at 37 °C. The enzymes were removed by centrifugation, and the cells were washed twice with Medium A. Cells were suspended in medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, and with 15 ng/ml ovine follicle stimulating hormone (ovine FSH-20, National Pituitary Program, NIDDK), 10 ng/ml testosterone (Sigma) and plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates and cultured at a CO2 incubator for 3–5 days. Rat Leydig cells were prepared from adult male rat testes by collagenase digestion and purified by centrifugal elutriation (11Aquilano D.R. Dufau M.L. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The purified Leydig cells were suspended in M199 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 × antibiotic/antimycotic and plated at the density of 0.5 × 106 cells/cm2 and cultured for up to 20 h. Lambda phage DNA with genomic PRLR DNA inserts of 15 and 14.5 kb were used for fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The probes were labeled with biotin (lambda phage clone λ11-1, 15 kb, containing PRLR PI/PII regions) or spectrum orange (lambda phage clone λ3a, 14.5 kb, containing PIII region) by nick translation (Life Technologies, Inc.) and hybridized to rat metaphase chromosomes as described previously (12Guan X.-Y. Meltzer P.S. Trent J.M. Genomics. 1994; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, about 200 ng of each probe was used in 10 μl of hybridization mixture containing 55% formamide, 2 × SSC, and 1 μg of humanCot I DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) that was denatured at 75 °C for 5 min. Slides with rat metaphase chromosomal spreads were denatured in 70% formamide, 2 × SSC at 72 °C for 2 min, and hybridized with the specified probes at 37 °C in a moist chamber overnight. Slides were then washed three times in 50% formamide, 2 × SSC at 45 °C for 3 min each. The hybridization signal of the probe was detected by two layers of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA) and amplified with one layer of anti-avidin antibody (Vector). Slides were counterstained with 0.5 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in an antifade solution (1 mg/mlp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 10% phosphate-buffered saline (v/v), 90% glycerol (v/v), 4.2% sodium carbonate (w/v)) and was examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a dual bandpass filter. For mapping of the plasmid DNA isolated from a P1 genomic library (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) containing the 5′-flanking regions of the rat PRLR gene, the plasmid was digested withBam HI or in combination with Not I followed by Southern blot hybridization with oligonucleotide probes derived from E11, E12, and E13. DNA fragments of the 5′-flanking region containing promoter I were either generated by restriction enzyme digestion (Kpn I/Xba I, −1566/−124) or by PCR amplification. For generation of plasmid constructs, the 5′-flanking DNA fragments of PI were ligated 5′ to the luciferase gene (LUC) of the linearized plasmid pGL2 (Promega, Madison, WI). The pGL2 constructs were numbered relative to the translation initiation codon (PI(−#/−#)/LUC). The recombinant adenovirus (Adv) luciferase reporter constructs containing the putative promoter region (5′-flanking region of the PRLR) 5′ to the luciferase gene [PI(−#/−#)/LUC/Adv] were prepared as described previously (13Alcorn J.L. Gao E. Chen Q. Smith M.E. Gerard R.D. Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1072-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′-flanking region of PRLR-luciferase (5′PRLR/LUC) minigenes were excised from pGL2 plasmid constructs using Sma I/Bam HI and inserted to the Eco RV/Bam HI site of pAC plasmid, which contains partial sequences of the adenovirus 5 genome. The resulting pAC/PI/LUC constructs were co-transfected with plasmid pJM17, which contains the remainder of the adenovirus genome into human embryonic 293 cells. In vivo homologous recombination of the plasmids yields recombinant viral genome (PI/LUC/Adv) and subsequent generation of infectious viral particles. Viral plaques were isolated and propagated to a titer of 109 ml−1 in the 293 cells and were used for infection of primary cultures of rat gonadal cells. Structure of the fusion genes was verified by PCR amplification of the insert and the subsequent DNA sequence analysis. For RT-PCR analyses of RNA from MLTC, first strand cDNA was synthesized with random primers using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 30 min. Primers used for PCR amplification of exons E11 and E13 were 5′-GTGGCCAGAGCCATGGACAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAACTCTTTCCTCGGAGGTCACTAG-3′ (reverse), 5′-TCTCAGAGACACGCGGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTGCTGGAGAGAAAAGTCTG-3′ (reverse), respectively. PCR fragments were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel. 5′-RACE PCR analyses of RNA from luciferase reporter plasmid PI(−1566/−124)/LUC transfected in MLTC were performed as described previously (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using primer GS1 (5′-AGCGGTTCCATCCTCTAG-3′) (+7 to +24 of the luciferase coding region) and 3′-end-tailed with dCTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase followed by PCR with primer GS2 (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′) (+44 to +66 of the LUC coding region) and dG-adaptor primer (5′-GCGAATTCTCGAGATCTGGGII GGGII GGGII G-3′), where I represents inosine. The PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel and subjected to Southern blot analyses using nested oligonucleotide probe GS3 (5′-TCTACCTAACCCGCCCACTGGTT-3′) within E11. Primers used for 5′-RACE PCR analyses of rat mammary gland PRLR mRNA were same as described previously (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNAs from the rat ovary, Leydig cells, mammary gland, and MLTC were prepared and analyzed by Northern blot as described previously (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Hu Z.Z. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins from MLTC, rat granulosa cells, and rat Leydig cells were extracted as described (14Tsai-Morris C.H. Xie X. Wang W. Buczko E. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4447-4452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were suspended in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm Pefabloc SC (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A (Sigma) with additional 0.3 m sucrose and 2% Nonidet P-40 and homogenized 20 strokes with type B pestle. The nuclei were recovered by centrifugation of the cell homogenate through a 1.5 m sucrose cushion contained in buffer A and lysed in buffer B (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm pefabloc SC, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The nuclear lysate was dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.4 mm pefabloc SC, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A) overnight at 4 °C. The concentration of the nuclear proteins was measured by the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Double-stranded DNA fragment corresponding to the region of PI at −827 to −440 was used for DNase I footprinting analysis. One strand end-labeled DNA probes were generated by first labeling the 5′ end with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol, DuPont NEN) of either forward primer (5′-TGTCTGCCTCATGAGAATAC-3′) or reverse primer (5′-TCTACCTAACCCGCCCACTGGTT-3′) followed by PCR amplification of the DNA fragment with one labeled and one unlabeled primer. For each footprinting reaction, 5 × 104 cpm of the probe was added to 10–20 μg of nuclear protein in 50 μl of mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. DNase I digestion was performed by adding 1 × DNase I buffer (25 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl, and 1 mmCaCl2) containing 1 unit of DNase I (Promega) and incubation for 1 min at 22 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of stop buffer (200 mm NaCl, 30 mmEDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA) and 110 μl of phenol/chloroform. The digested DNA fragments were recovered by ethanol precipitation and resolved on 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. Synthesized oligonucleotides were used for gel mobility shift assays unless otherwise indicated. The oligomers were annealed and 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 mCi/mmol, DuPont NEN). 1–3 μg of nuclear protein was added to 20 μl of reaction containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmTris-HCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 25 μg/ml polydeoxyinosinic deoxycytidylic acid on ice for 15–30 min followed by addition of 5 × 104 cpm of the probe for additional 15 min. For competition assay, unlabeled DNA sequences were added to the reaction 15 min prior to the addition of the probe. For supershift assay, SF-1 antibody 1 (a gift from Dr. Ken-ichirou Morohashi, Kyushu University, Japan) (15Morahashi K. Iida H. Nomura M. Hatano O. Honda S. Tsukiyama T. Niwa O. Hara T. Takakusu A. Shibta Y. Omura T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 643-653PubMed Google Scholar) or antibody 2 (8Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) (purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc, Lake Placid, NY) was incubated with nuclear proteins for 30 min prior to the addition of the probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. MLTC cells were transfected at 50–70% confluency ∼48 h after plating usingN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Boehringer Mannheim) as described previously (16Leventis R. Silvius J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1023: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 40–60 h after transfection, and whole cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity (17Alam J. Cook J.L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Since the primary rat gonadal cells were not amenable for transient expression of PRLR-PI/LUC reporter gene constructs by conventional liposome-mediated transfection in our experiments, the recombinant adenovirus infection method was applied in this study. Adenovirus reporter gene constructs (PI/LUC/Adv) were added at multiplicity of infection of 100 to the granulosa or Leydig cell culture and incubated for 20 h. Adenovirus construct containing the promoterless luciferase gene served as background control and a construct containing the SV40 promoter-luciferase gene as positive control. The granulosa cells were infected after 3 days of culture, and the infection was allowed to continue for 20 h before termination. The Leydig cells were infected 2 h after plating, and human chorionic gonadotropin was added to a final concentration of 20 ng/ml 6 h before termination. The infection was also allowed to continue for 20 h. Whole cell lysates were used for measurement of luciferase activity. The fluorescence in situ hybridization method was used to establish the chromosomal location of the rat PRLR gene and to determine whether the three PRLR gene promoter regions that direct transcription of alternative first exons reside at the same gene locus. The genomic probe (15 kb) containing the 5′-flanking region corresponding to both PI and PII promoter regions has located these regions at the chromosomal locus 2q16 (Fig. 1,above). The same finding was obtained using the genomic probe containing coding exons 4 and 5 of the rat PRLR (not shown). The PIII promoter region was also located at the identical locus on the same metaphase chromosome when probed with a genomic fragment (14.5 kb) containing the PIII region (Fig. 1, above). The order of the three promoters in the gene was determined by mapping overlapping genomic clones (Fig. 1, middle). The size of the DNA insert cloned from the rat P1 genomic library is ∼96 kb as determined by restriction digestion and agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1,middle left). A 55-kb Bam HI fragment was hybridized by two oligomer probes derived from E11 (Fig. 1,middle right, lanes 1-3) but not from E12 (not shown) or E13 (lane 4).Lanes 2 and 3 show a 35-kb positive fragment generated from the 55-kb fragment with Not I digestion, which cleaves at a unique site of the 16-kb vector. Furthermore, aBam HI-digested fragment of 8 kb was specifically hybridized by the oligomer probe derived from E13 (lane 4). However, no hybridization of this genomic DNA was revealed by the oligomer probes derived from E12 (not shown). These results indicated that this 96-kb genomic fragment of the rat PRLR gene contained both regions corresponding to exons E11 and E13 as well as their putative promoter regions PI and PIII but not PII and exon E12. Since previously we have established that PI region is located 10 kb 5′ of PII region (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we could derive that the order of these 5′-flanking/promoter regions of the PRLR gene is 5′-PIII-PI-PII-3′, which spans over 20 kb in the genome. Due to the lack of appropriate rat gonadal stable cell lines, we have utilized a mouse Leydig tumor cell line (MLTC-1) (18Rebois R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 94: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) for investigation of the transcriptional control of the PRLR gene promoters. For these studies, it was necessary to initially characterize the endogenous expression of PRLR alternative exons in these cells. Northern blot analysis showed a major mRNA transcript of 9.5 kb comparable to the 9.7 kb of the rat species using 5′-coding region of the rat PRLR as the probe (Fig. 2 A, left). In addition, minor transcripts of 4.2, 2.4, and 1.4 kb were also revealed in MLTC. Based on the high similarity between the rat and the mouse PRLR cDNAs, primers derived from the rat E11and E13 were used for RT-PCR analyses of mRNA from rat ovaries and MLTC cells. PCR products of identical sizes for E11 (325 bp) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4) and for E13 (229 bp) (lanes 5–7) were observed for the rat ovary and MLTC (mouse), indicating analogous expression of alternative first exons E11 and E13 in both species. Furthermore, recent genomic cloning of the mouse E13 and its 5′-flanking region showed 94% sequence similarity between the rat and the mouse within the noncoding exon E13 and the proximal 5′-flanking region (not shown). These results indicate that as in rat gonads, the PRLR expression is also under the control of putative promoters PI and PIII in MLTC cells. The promoter utilization of the PRLR gene in rat mammary gland was also examined. Northern blot analyses showed that the major mRNA transcript in this tissue is the 1.8-kb species (Fig. 2 C,left), which is also seen in the Leydig cells (right) and the liver (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and corresponds to the short form of the receptor (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Hu Z.Z. Dufau M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). 5′-RACE PCR analyses of mRNA from the rat mammary gland showed that only E13 sequences were present in this tissue by sequencing the PCR products (not shown) and by Southern blot analysis of the PCR products (Fig. 2 D). Neither E11 nor E12 sequences were found to be present in the mammary tissue by Southern hybridization by oligonucleotide probes derived from E11 (lane 3 and 4) or E12 (lane 5 and6). This result indicated that PIII is the sole promoter utilized in the rat mammary gland and further demonstrated that the usage of PI is restricted to the gonads among the tissues examined. A luciferase reporter gene construct containing the 5′-flanking region with adjacent E11 sequence [PI(−1566/−124)/LUC] was examined for its promoter activity in the steroidogenic MLTC and the non-steroidogenic cell line HepG2. This genomic fragment exhibited strong promoter activity, which was 43-fold over that of the promoterless vector and about 60% that of the SV40 promoter in MLTC. In contrast, only minimal induction was observed in HepG2 cells, where the SV40 promoter displayed activities comparable to those observed in MLTC cells (Fig. 3, left). This finding indicated the specificity of activation of promoter I in MLTC and is consistent with the pattern of promoter utilization in vivo, where PI activity was found only in gonads but not in the liver (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the mammary gland (Fig. 2 D). The transcription initiation site from the PI(−1566/−124)/LUC construct transfected in MLTC was determined by the 5′-RACE PCR method. An extended product of ∼540 bp was revealed on Southern hybridization of the PCR products by a nested probe (GS3, Fig. 3, right, above), and the transcriptional initiation site derived from this experiment was consistent with that reported for the rat ovary (−549 relative to translation initiation codon at +1) (1Hu Z. Zhuang L. Dufau M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10242-10246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, right, below). These results indicate that MLTC is an appropriate cell line for characterization of the regulatory components of this gonad-specific promoter (PI), since the PI/LUC construct is highly active and faithfully transcribed in MLTC. The PRLR PI/LUC constructs with serial deletion of the 5′-flanking region were expressed in MLTC to localize the minimal promoter domain. Deletion of the 5′-flanking sequences beyond −700 had no significant effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 4). The region between −700 and −549 was required for promoter activity, whereas deletion of the downstream exon 1 sequences (−124 to −549) had no significant effect on promoter activity. Thus, the 152-bp region between −700 and −549 retained full promoter activity in transfected MLTC cells. In contrast, the PI(−1566/−124)/LUC construct (Fig. 3) and the deletion mutants of PI including the minimal promoter domain −700/−549 (not shown) exerted only minor promoter activities in HepG2 cells, further indicating the tissue specificity of promoter I for expression in gonadal cells. The regulatory cis-elements and transcriptional activators required for this promoter were further analyzed by the DNA-protein binding analyses and site-directed mutagenesis of regulatory elements within the promoter domain. DNase I footprinting analysis using nuclear extracts from MLTC was employed to examine the specific nu"

Although a variety of stimuli including erythropoietin (Epo) have been shown to tyrosine phosphorylate Vav, little is known about the Vav signal transduction pathway. Here, we have investigated the role of Vav in the Epo signaling pathway by characterizing its interaction with other proteins, using the human Epo-responsive cell line, F-36P. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analyses have demonstrated that Vav was associated with the Epo receptor (EpoR) in an Epo-independent manner and was tyrosine-phosphorylated after Epo stimulation. Furthermore, two phosphotyrosine proteins (pp70 and pp100) co-immunoprecipitated with the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) (p85) were identified as EpoR and Vav, respectively. The interaction between Vav and p85 was shown to be mediated through the SH2 domains of p85 by an in vitro binding assay and confirmed by the presence of in vitro PI3-kinase activity associated with Vav. Treatment of the cells with antisense-vav and -p85 abrogated Epo-induced cell proliferation and PI3-kinase activity. Finally, we found that JAK2 was associated with Vav in vivo and that Vav could be tyrosine-phosphorylated by activated JAK2 in vitro. These results suggest the possible role of JAK2 for tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and involvement of Vav and PI3-kinase in Epo-induced proliferative signals.

Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Recently, Epo has been demonstrated to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, and Vav may be involved in growth signaling from the EpoR (28Miura O. Miura Y. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential downstream signaling proteins interacting with Vav in Epo signaling pathway remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Vav in the Epo signaling pathway by characterizing its interaction with proteins that are known to be involved in Epo signal transduction. We observed a stable association of Vav with the EpoR and the physical interaction between Vav and p85 in response to Epo. We also examined the kinase responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and detected an Epo-induced association of JAK2 with Vav and tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav by JAK2. F-36P (kindly provided by Dr. S. Chiba, University of Tokyo, Japan), a human IL-3 and GM-CSF-dependent cell line, was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10 ng/ml IL-3. Anti-JAK2 and EpoR polyclonal antibodies, anti-rat p85 PI3-kinase antiserum, and anti-human Vav monoclonal antibody were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-EpoR antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. O. Miura (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan). Anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) monoclonal antibody (PY20) was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Anti-p85 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was obtained from Amersham Corp. Recombinant human IL-3 and Epo were kindly provided from Kirin Brewery (Tokyo, Japan). All other reagents were purchased from commercial sources. Cells (1 × 107) were starved of growth factors for 24 h and then stimulated with or without Epo (50 units/ml) at 37 °C for the indicated periods. The cells were washed and lysed in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmNa3VO4). After 15 min of incubation at 4 °C, the insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with the indicated antibodies or antiserum for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C and immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer and eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C super; Amersham Corp., UK) using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). The filter was blocked by incubation in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl) containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The blots then were incubated for 1 h with an appropriate concentration of the primary antibody in TBS, washed three times for 5 min each with TBS-T (TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20), and probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of biotinylated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig followed by incubation with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Caltag, South San Francisco, CA). After washing, the blots were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.). Short-term proliferative responses to Epo were examined by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The cells (1 × 104) were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence or absence of 20 units/ml Epo before the addition of 0.25 μCi of [3H]thymidine. The cells were pulsed for 4 h and then harvested onto glass fiber filters. The filter strips were dried, and the amount of radioactivity present on each filter was determined. Agarose-conjugated glutathioneS-transferase (GST) -p85 SH2-N (amino acids 333–428) and SH2-C (amino acids 624–718) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. For the in vitro binding assays, the GST fusion proteins were incubated in cell lysates at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were washed four times with lysis buffer, eluted by boiling in Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-Vav antibody. Cells (1 × 107) were stimulated with or without Epo, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-p85, anti-Tyr(P), or anti-Vav antibody as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, three times with 50 mm LiCl in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and twice with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 100 μm Na3VO4. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of TNE buffer, followed by the addition of 10 μl of PI (2 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA) and 10 μl of 100 mmMgCl2. The reactions were initiated by adding 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 2 μl of 100 mm ATP in 20 mm MgCl2 and then were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated with 100 μl of 1n HCl and 200 μl of CHCl3-MeOH (1:1), vortexed briefly, and separated into phases by centrifugation (2,000 rpm) for 10 min. The CHCl3 phases were spotted onto oxalate-treated thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates and developed using a solvent system of CHCl3:MeOH:H2O:ammonium hydroxide (90:70:14.6:5.4). The PI3-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). Antisense (AS) and complementary sense (S) ODNs that targeted the translation initiation regions of the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) and the proto-oncogenevav were synthesized in fully phosphorothioated forms. The sequence of each 20-mer was as follows: AS-p85 (5′-TGGTACCCCTCAGCACTCAT-3′), S-p85 (5′-ATGAGTGCTGAGGGGTACCA-3′), AS-vav (5′-CATTGGCGCCACAGCTCCAT-3′), S-vav(5′-ATGGAGCTGTGGCGCCAATG-3′). The F-36P cells (1 × 104cells) were exposed to ODNs at the indicated concentration in the defined medium for 6 h prior to the addition of Epo (50 units/ml). After 18 h of incubation, the cells were labeled for 4 h with 0.25 μCi of [3H]thymidine prior to harvest. For the analysis of the expression of p85 and Vav, the ODN-treated cells were lysed, and total cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by anti-p85 or anti-Vav immunoblotting as described above. The JAK2 and Vav proteins were immunoprecipitated from serum-starved F-36P cells as described above and resuspended in the kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2). Sepharose beads-conjugated Vav protein immunoprecipitated from Epo-unstimulated cells were mixed with the immunoprecipitated JAK2 kinases from the cells stimulated with or without Epo. The kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 200 mm ATP, incubated for 15 min at 25 °C, and terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The reaction mixtures were boiled for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, followed by immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P) as described above. All of the experiments described under “Results” were carried out at least twice and yielded similar results. To examine the growth signaling pathway from the EpoR, the human nonlymphoid leukemia cell line F-36P was utilized. F-36P has an absolute dependence on IL-3 or GM-CSF and can be induced to proliferate in response to Epo (data not shown) (29Chiba S. Takaku F. Tange T. Shibuya K. Misawa C. Sasaki K. Miyagawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1991; 78: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a previous study has shown that Epo induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav and suggested that Vav may play an important role in growth signaling from the EpoR (28Miura O. Miura Y. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the molecules involved in the Vav signaling pathway. To identify any phosphorylated proteins that might interact with Vav, F-36P cells were stimulated with Epo, and anti-Vav immunoprecipitates were examined for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) and anti-Vav immunoblotting (Fig. 1). Consistent with the previous study (28Miura O. Miura Y. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Epo induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav, and identical levels of Vav protein were present in each lane. In addition, a tyrosine-phosphorylated 70-kDa protein (pp70) also was observed after Epo stimulation. It has been shown that Epo induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the EpoR itself which causes a shift in its gel mobility from 66 to 72 kDa (8Miura O. D'Andrea A. Kabat D. Ihre J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Yoshimura A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 706-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To confirm that the co-immunoprecipitated pp70 represents the tyrosine-phosphorylated EpoR and to examine whether Vav binds to the EpoR constitutively or inducibly after Epo stimulation, anti-EpoR immunoprecipitates were subjected to anti-Vav immunoblotting. Fig.2 A shows that Vav was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-EpoR in an Epo-independent manner. Furthermore, Vav co-immunoprecipitated unphosphorylated EpoR with or without Epo stimulation and phosphorylated EpoR after Epo stimulation (Fig.2 B), whereas neither normal rabbit serum nor preimmune mouse serum co-immunoprecipitated Vav or EpoR, respectively. These results indicate that Vav constitutively associates with the EpoR and suggest that this binding may be independent of tyrosine phosphorylation of the EpoR.Figure 2Stable association of Vav with the EpoR.F-36P cells were stimulated with or without Epo at 37 °C for 10 min.A, the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-EpoR or normal rabbit serum (NRS), and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Vav. B, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Vav or preimmune mouse serum (pre) and subjected to anti-EpoR immunoblotting.

Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Gobert et al. (30Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that a truncated EpoR, which had no tyrosine residues and no longer bound PI3-kinase, can mediate Epo-induced activation of PI3-kinase and suggested an alternative pathway for PI3-kinase activation (30Gobert S. Porteu F. Pallu S. Muller O. Sabbah M. Dusanter-Fourt I. Courtois G. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P. Blood. 1995; 86: 598-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test for the substrates associated with p85, anti-p85 immunoprecipitation and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting were performed (Fig.3). Epo stimulation led to no tyrosine phosphorylation of p85 as previously reported (11Damen J.E. Mui A.L.-F. Puil L. Pawson T. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3204-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were associated with p85 after Epo stimulation, including two that migrated at approximately 100 (pp100) and 70 kDa (pp70). Consistent with previous reports (11Damen J.E. Mui A.L.-F. Puil L. Pawson T. Krystal G. Blood. 1993; 81: 3204-3210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pp70 was identified as the tyrosine-phosphorylated EpoR, and p85 associates with the EpoR after Epo stimulation (Fig. 4 A). We then examined whether the pp100 that binds to p85 corresponds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav. Fig. 4 B (left panel) shows that Vav was detected in anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 4 B (right panel), anti-Vav immunoprecipitates blotted with p85 revealed an association of Vav with p85. The binding of p85 to the tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav strongly suggests that this binding may be mediated through the SH2 domains of p85. To address this possibility, the cell lysates were incubated with agarose-conjugated GST fusion protein containing either the amino-terminal SH2 domain of p85 (SH2N) or the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain (SH2C) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Vav. Fig.5 shows that both the SH2 domains in the cell lysates from the Epo-stimulated cells can bind Vav in vitro, although the carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain binds to Vav with a higher affinity than does the amino-terminal SH2 domain. To better clarify the interaction between Vav and PI3-kinase, in vitro PI3-kinase assays were performed with anti-Tyr(P) and anti-Vav immunoprecipitates. We found that the Epo-induced in vitro PI3-kinase activity was associated with Vav (Fig. 6). Although the PI3-kinase activity of the anti-Vav immunoprecipitates was approximately 1/100 that of the anti-p85 immunoprecipitates after Epo stimulation, the activity of anti-Vav immunoprecipitates resulted in accounting for approximately 80% that of anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates (data not shown). These results suggest that Epo stimulation leads to the association of PI3-kinase with tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav via the SH2 domain(s) of p85.Figure 4Epo-induced association of p85 with the EpoR and Vav. F-36P cells were stimulated with or without Epo at 37 °C for 10 min. A, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-p85 (left panel) and anti-EpoR antibody (right panel).

Blood. 1994; 84: 4135-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that Vav plays an important role in growth signaling. On the other hand, p85 has been shown to associate with the carboxyl-terminal region of the EpoR, a domain that may not play a role in growth signaling (12Miura O. Nakamura N. Ihre J.N. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 614-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the functional role of Vav and p85 in EpoR signaling pathway, we utilized antisense (AS) and complementary sense (S) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) that targeted the translation initiation regions of the proto-oncogene vav and the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) in fully phosphorothioated forms. Epo-stimulated F-36P cells were incubated with AS- or S- ODNs for 24 h and analyzed by immunoblotting. Treatment of AS-vav and AS-p85 resulted in significant decreases in the expression of Vav and p85 compared with the sense treatment (Fig.7, A and C). If Vav significantly contributes to the proliferation signaling from the EpoR, down-regulation of the expression of Vav should result in the inhibition of cell growth. To test this hypothesis, the effect of AS-vav on cell proliferation was examined by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Fig. 7 A shows that AS-vav treatment inhibited the Epo-dependent proliferation of F-36P cells in a dose-dependent manner after co-incubation for 24 h, a time point when cell viability in all cultures was >90% (data not shown), whereas S-vav had no significant effect. This indicates that the observed inhibition of cell growth was due to antisense-mediated loss of Vav and not to growth suppression by ODN degradation products. Since we have observed the physical interaction between Vav and p85, we next examined the effect of AS-vav treatment on Epo-induced activation of PI3-kinase. F-36P cells were incubated in defined medium with Epo and 10 μm AS- or S-vav for 24 h. The cells were lysed, and in vitro PI3-kinase assays were carried out with anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 7 B, treatment of cells with AS-vav resulted in a marked inhibition of PI3-kinase activity, suggesting the possible role of Vav on Epo-induced PI3-kinase activity. To confirm the involvement of Vav-p85 pathway in Epo-induced proliferation, we subsequently examined the effect of AS-p85 on cell proliferation. Although the cell viability in all cultures was >90% and no significant differences of the viability were observed with or without AS-ODN treatment (data not shown), AS-p85 treatment significantly suppressed the [3H]thymidine uptake (Fig.7 C), as observed in AS-vav treatment. It is important to identify the possible tyrosine kinases responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav in the Epo signaling pathway.

In vitro studies showed that these ribozymes were specific for the oncogenic form of N-ras, since cleavage was observed only in a 849-nucleotide-long transcript containing mutant but not wild-type N-ras sequences. For the ex vivo studies, the ribozymes were 2′-modified to protect them against degradation by nucleases. 2′-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine/cytidine-substituted ribozymes were nearly as active as their unmodified counterparts, but had a prolonged stability in cell culture supernatant containing fetal calf serum. The stability of the modified ribozymes increased by introduction of terminal phosphorothioates groups without significant influence in their catalytic efficiency. A sensitive assay based on the use of N-ras/luciferase fusion genes as a reporter system was established to detect ribozyme-mediated cleavage in HeLa cells. A reduction of nearly 60% in luciferase activity was observed in cells expressing mutant but not wild-type N-ras/luciferase fusion transcripts.

Catalytic RNAs include Group I and Group II introns and ribozymes of the hammerhead, hairpin, and hepatitis delta virus type and the subunit of RNase P (1Altman S. Adv.

Hammerhead ribozymes are the smallest catalytic RNA found to date. They consist of three stems connected by a conserved core region. They recognize substrates containing an NUH base triplet (N can be any base; H can be A, C, or U) and cleave the phosphodiester bond on the 3′ side of H. The GUC base triplet is cleaved most efficiently (6Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 7Ruffner D.E. Stormo G.D. Uhlenbeck O.C.

Thus, like other strategies, e.g. antisense and triple helix formation, ribozymes appear to be promising agents to inhibit expression of specific oncogenes. In general, the most difficult step toward an ex vivo application of ribozymes is the delivery of the ribozyme into the cells. Ribozymes can be applied directly to cells (exogenous delivery), or plasmid or viral vectors can be used to express the ribozyme within living cells (endogenous delivery). For the exogenous application, ribozymes are delivered into cells by microinjection (10Saxena S.K. Ackerman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17106-17109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or transfection (21Kiehntopf M. Brach M.A. Licht T. Petschauer S. Karawajew L. Kirschning C. Herrmann F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4645-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the latter case, CaCl2 or cationic liposomes have been mostly used as transfection reagents. Additional exogenous delivery methods are based on the conjugation of the oligonucleotides to polylysine compounds (22Leonetti J.P. Deglos G. Lebleu B. Bioconjugate Chem. 1990; 1: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or to lipophilic groups, like cholesterol (23Letsinger R.L. Zhang G. Sun D.K. Ikeuchi T. Sarin P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6553-6556Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 24MacKellar C. Graham D. Will D.W. Burgess S. Brown T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A problem that arises from exogenous delivery is the low stability of unmodified ribozymes in cell culture supernatant containing fetal calf serum. Since the 2′-hydroxyl group plays an important role in the degradation mechanism by nucleases, ribozymes have been protected against degradation by modification of the 2′-hydroxyl position (25Paolella G. Sproat B.S. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1913-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar,26Perreault J.-P. Wu T. Cousineau B. Ogilvie K.K. Cedergren R.

Kobayashi S. Yamamoto N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have been used. The growth and differentiation of cells depends on a variety of parameters and signal transduction pathways. The proteins coded by the three ras genes (Ha-ras, N-ras, and Ki-ras) are involved in cell signal transduction and are members of the supergene family of small GTP/GDP-binding proteins (32Edgington S.M. Bio/Technology. 1992; 10: 152-154PubMed Google Scholar,33Collins S. Caron H.G. Leftzowik P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 37-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). ras mutations have been detected in a wide variety of tumors such as pancreatic carcinomas (34Bos J.L. Mutat.

Cell. 1988; 53: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar) and tumors of the stomach and breast (36Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 37Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). N-ras mutations have also been found in neuroblastoma, melanoma, acute myeloblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and multiple myeloma (38Portier M. Moles J.-P. Mazars G.-R. Jeanteur P. Bataille R. Klein C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2539-2543PubMed Google Scholar). Studies ofras oncogenes in tumors have revealed several point mutations in codons 12, 13, 59, or 61, which cause structural changes in the GTP binding site and reduce GTPase activity (39Hirai H. Kobayashi Y. Mano H. Hagiwara K. Maru Y. Omine M. Mizoguchi H. Nishida J. Takaku F. Nature. 1987; 327: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Binding of GTP leads to an active state of the Ras proteins, whereas hydrolysis of GTP to GDP causes inactivation. Mutant Ras proteins, having a reduced ability to hydrolyze GTP, remain in the active state and thus stimulate cell growth or differentiation autonomously. The inhibition of the incorrect signal transduction by ribozymes may lead to an efficient anti-cancer therapy. In the present study we report the synthesis and catalytic properties of several hammerhead ribozymes targeted against mutant N-ras transcripts. These hammerhead ribozymes were tested for efficiency and specificity in vitro and ex vivo. In addition, the effect of 2′-modifications on the cleavage efficiency and stability of the ribozymes in cell culture media containing fetal calf serum was analyzed. Furthermore, a reporter gene system based on luciferase gene expression was established to evaluate the catalytic properties of 2′-modified ribozymes ex vivo. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to assess mRNA cleavage by the ribozymes. Our study demonstrates that ribozymes targeted against mutant N-ras sequences are highly specific and efficientin vitro and ex vivo. Ribonucleoside phosphoramidites and control pore glass columns were obtained from PerSeptive Biosystems. The sulfurizing reagent C-6 Thiol was purchased from Chemgens. The 2′-fluoro-modified ribonucleosides were a kind gift of Dr. T. Wittmann and Isis Pharmaceuticals. The 2′-amino-2′-deoxyuridine was a kind gift from K. Jahn-Hoffmann (Universität Frankfurt). The 2′-O-methylribonucleosides and 2′-deoxyribonucleosides were obtained from PerSeptive Biosystems. Nucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Radiolabeled nucleoside triphosphates [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP with the specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol were obtained from Amersham. Oligoribonucleotides were prepared on an Applied Biosystems model 380B DNA Synthesizer on a 1-μmol scale. The oligoribonucleotides were base deprotected by incubation of the glass support with 3 ml of aequeous concentrated ammonia (33%)/ethanol (3:1 (v/v)) at 55 °C for 16 h. After complete removal of the solvent by Speed-Vac evaporation, the 2′-silyl group was removed by overnight incubation at room temperature in 1 m tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran. After addition of 0.5 ml of 3m sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2), the tetrahydrofuran was removed on a Speed-Vac concentrator and the aqueous phase was extracted twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The oligoribonucleotide was precipitated by addition of 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of water. The RNA solution was purified on polyacrylamide gels (12% or 20%) containing 8 m urea. The RNA was visualized under UV light, excised from the gel, and eluated in 0.05 m ammonium acetate solution (pH 7.0) overnight. Thereafter, the RNA solution was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column, and fractions of 1 ml were collected and stored frozen at −20 °C. The homogeneity of the ribozyme RNA and substrate RNA was checked by mass spectrometry and analytical PAGE. RNA concentration was determined by assuming an extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 6.6 × 103m−1 cm−1 (40Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). All oligoribonucleotides (unmodified and modified ribozymes) were characterized by MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; DTT, 1,4-dithio-dl-threitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); FCS, fetal calf serum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; RT, reverse transcriptase. mass detection as shown in Fig. 1. The MALDI mass spectra were recorded on a VG TofSpec. For a MALDI-TOF spectrum, the RNA solution was mixed with the matrix compound. The pcN1 plasmid (41Hall A. Brown R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5255-5268Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) containing most of the N-ras cDNA was kindly provided by A. Hall (Medical Research Council, London, United Kingdom). The N-ras sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned in the plasmid pBluescript II KS (Stratagene) to generate pMS1-NRAS. A plasmid containing the full-length N-ras cDNA sequence was constructed according to the strategy described by Khorana (42Khorana H.G. Science. 1979; 203: 614-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For this purpose four overlapping oligodeoxynucleotides (99–102 nucleotides each) containing the 5′-termini sequences of N-ras were synthesized and cloned into pMS1-NRAS to generate pMS5-NRAS. Thus, pMS5-NRAS contains N-ras sequence from the transcription initiation site to the transcription termination site. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis employing standard procedures. In vitro transcription of pMS5-NRAS gave the expected 849-nucleotide-long RNA product. Two point mutations in codon 13 of N-ras were introduced into plasmid pMS5-NRAS by PCR-based technology. Plasmid pMS5A-NRAS contains a G → T transversion at position 764, whereas plasmid pMS5B-NRAS contains a G → C transversion at position 763. All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. A N-ras/luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing the first 452 bp of N-ras fused in frame with the luciferase gene was constructed. For this the translation initiation codon of the luciferase gene was mutated to ATA by insertion of a 70-bp linker containing the altered sequence at the Xba I site of plasmid pBHEluc (kindly provided by H. Hauser, Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany). Subsequently plasmids pMS5-NRAS, pMS5A-NRAS, and pMS5B-NRAS were digested with Bam HI and Pfl MI, and the so obtained 452-bp DNA fragments containing either wild-type or any of the mutated N-ras sequences were fused in frame to the firefly luciferase gene. The N-ras/luciferase fusion genes were cloned in the expression plasmid pcDNA3 (InVitrogen), and the resulting plasmids were named pcDNA3-LucFUW (wild-type N-ras), pcDNA3-LucFUC (GGT → CGT mutation), and pcDNA3-LucFUT (GGT → GTT mutation). The sequence of the fusion genes were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. For in vitro transcription pMS5-NRAS, pMS5A-NRAS, and pMS5B-NRAS were linearized with Eco RI, phenol-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated. In vitro transcription was carried out in 100 μl of mixture containing 50 ng/μl linearized plasmid DNA, 10 mm DTT, 40 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 500 μm rNTPs, 0.8 unit/μl RNase inhibitor, 2 μCi/μl [α-32P]ATP, and 2.5 units/μl T7 RNA polymerase. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, DNase I (25 units) was added and the mixture incubated for another 10 min at 37 °C. After subsequent phenol extraction, the aqueous phase was transferred into a Centricon-100 tube and centrifuged at 3,400 rpm for 30 min. The RNA solution was checked for homogeneity by UV absorption and in a 6% analytical PAGE (8 m urea). The RNA was stored frozen at −20 °C. Kinetic constants Km andkcat were determined from Eadie-Hofstee plots carried out with 32P-labeled substrates. Ribozyme and substrate were heated separately for 1 min at 75 °C in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and for 5 min at 37 °C. Then 100 mm MgCl2 were added to a final concentration of 10 mm and the solutions were incubated for an additional 5 min at 37 °C. “Steady state” reactions were carried out in a volume of 100 μl with substrate concentrations between 20 and 500 nm and ribozyme concentrations from 2 to 5 nmin 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 10 mmMgCl2 at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated by addition of ribozyme. The reaction was stopped by mixing the ribozymes with an equal volume of stop solution (8 m urea, 25 mmEDTA). The cleavage reactions were analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (8 m urea) and scanned on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. “Single-turnover” reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μl containing 20–1200 nm ribozyme, 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was initiated by addition of 2–10 nm32P-labeled RNA substrate. Under these conditions the concentration of ribozyme is at least in a 10-fold excess over substrate. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction was stopped by addition of 8 μl of stop mix to each reaction. The reaction products were analyzed as described above. The single turnoverkreact/Km values were determined as described (30Heidenreich O. Benseler F. Fahrenholz A. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2131-2138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS and 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm l-glutamine in 96-well plates. The oligoribonucleotide solutions (32 μl) containing modified or unmodified ribozymes were added to the cell culture supernatant (525 μl) to reach a final ribozyme concentration of 5 μm. Aliquots (67 μl) were taken at different time points and shock-frozen into liquid nitrogen to stop nuclease activity. After Speed-Vac evaporation, the pellets were resuspended in formamide and analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel (8m urea). Nucleic acid bands were visualized by silver staining. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 1 mm l-glutamine. Stable DNA transfections were performed by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method (43Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of CsCl-purified plasmid DNA containing either wild-type or mutant N-ras/luciferase fusion gene and the neomycin-resistance gene. After transfection cells were split at a ratio 1:40 and incubated for an additional 24 h before selection. Neomycin-resistant clones were obtained after 2 weeks of selection in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (50% biological activity). Individual cell clones were isolated, expanded, and tested for luciferase expression by the Triton X-100 lysis method (44de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. de Luca M. Helinski D. Subraman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown at a density of 3·104cells/ml in 96-well plates in Opti-MEM® (Life Science) for 24 h. Different amounts of ribozymes, ranging from 6 μm to 13 μm, were mixed with 3 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (2 μg/μl) and 10 μl of Opti-MEM® and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After the addition of 60 μl of Opti-MEM®, the mixture was given to the cells. Cells were incubated with the LipofectAMINE™-oligoribonucleotide complex for 8 h at 37 °C. Transfected cells were cultured for additional 24–36 h before testing for luciferase activity and mRNA analysis. Luciferase activity was determined by the Triton X-100 lysis method (44de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. de Luca M. Helinski D. Subraman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2480) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations determined with the Bradford protein assay were used to standardize the luciferase activity (45Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using a commercially available kit (GlassMAX RNA Microisolation Spin Cartridge System, Life Technologies, Inc.). After isolation and before the DNase I digestion step, the internal standard RNA (0.5 amol; see below) was added to the cellular RNA and the mixture was digested with DNase I for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by phenol chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Reverse transcription was performed in 20 μl of reaction volume in the presence of 10 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 3 mm MgCl2, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm dNTPs, 0.5 unit of RNasin, 50 ng of hexamer primer, and 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, followed by 90 min at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 94 °C for 7 min. An aliquot of the RT reaction was amplified under standard Perkin-Elmer Cetus PCR conditions (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C) in a total volume of 50 μl. In parallel, a β-actin PCR was performed to control for the RNA input in the RT-PCR. The following primers were used: 5′ β-actin, 5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′; 3′ β-actin, 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGCTTTC-3′; RT1-N-ras, 5′-GGGAGACCCAAGCTTGGTACC-3′; RT2-N-ras, 5′-ACTCGCTTAATCTGCTCCCTGTAGAG-3′. Reaction products were separated on a 4% NuSieve agarose gel in 1 × TAE and stained with ethidium bromide. To obtain an internal control for the RT-PCR, a 50-bp linker was inserted into the N-ras gene. The linker was cloned into the 5′-nontranslated region (Bam HI restriction site) of the N-ras gene in the expression plasmid pcDNA3-LucFUC. The construct was named pcDNA3-LucFUCL. To generate the internal standard RNA transcript, plasmid pcDNA3-LucFUCL was linearized withBst EII, in vitro transcribed as described above, and quantified by UV spectrophotometry. Two hammerhead ribozymes targeted against point mutations in codon 13 of the N-ras gene were synthesized. A GC transversion at position 763 generates a GUC triplet, which was targeted by the ribozyme MRE763C. An additional ribozyme, MRE764U, was targeted against a second GT transversion at position 764, which generates a GUU triplet (Fig. 2 A). For comparison purposes, three ribozymes recognizing either a GUC triplet at codon 89 (RE990) or a GUA triplet at codons 64 (RE917) and codon 103 (RE1035) of the wild-type N-ras mRNA were also investigated (Fig. 2 B). At first, short synthetic oligoribonucleotides 15 nucleotides in length containing the cleavage site were used to test for cleavage activity under steady-state conditions. The resulting Km andkcat values show equal catalytic efficiency for the ribozymes MRE763C, MRE764U, and RE917 (0.2·106s−1·m−1), whereas ribozyme RE990 has a kcat/Km value 2 orders of magnitude lower (Table I and Fig.3). RE1035 was found to have an intermediatekcat/Km value.Table ICatalytic efficiencies of different ribozymes with synthetic substratesRibozymekcatKmkcat/Kmmin −1nm10 6 ·s −1 ·m −1RE9170.78 ± 0.2078 ± 100.2RE9900.24 ± 0.08404 ± 450.009RE10350.78 ± 0.18277 ± 250.05MRE763C0.90 ± 0.1982 ± 190.2MRE764U0.72 ± 0.1065 ± 50.2The kcat and Km values were determined under steady state conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The measurements were repeated three times.

To study the cleavage efficiency of the ribozymes on larger RNA substrates, transcripts containing the full-length wild-type or mutant N-ras sequence were synthesized in vitro and used under single-turnover conditions in the cleavage reaction (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table II).Table IICatalytic efficiencies of different ribozymes with in vitro transcribed full-length N-ras transcriptsRibozymekreactKmkreact/Km10 −6 ·s −1nms −1 ·m −1RE91759 ± 8.263 ± 20938RE99072 ± 7.3234 ± 28307RE103544 ± 11425 ± 41103MRE763C266 ± 2571 ± 133752MRE764U137 ± 12.2113 ± 211212The catalytic values are determined under single-turnover conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The measurements were repeated three times. Open table in a new tab The catalytic values are determined under single-turnover conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The measurements were repeated three times. Ribozyme MRE763C showed the best catalytic activity. A computer-assisted folding analysis of the RNA substrate revealed a number of mismatches (bulges) at the binding region of ribozyme MRE763C. The same applies for the binding region of ribozyme MRE764U. In contrast the cleavage site of ribozyme RE1035 is embedded within a region that folds in a stable hairpin structure. Thus, the differences in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme and the large RNA substrate correlate well with the predicted secondary structure of the 849-nucleotide-long transcript. According to thekreact/Km values, the most effective ribozymes (MRE763C, MRE764U, and RE917) were chosen for further investigations. The specificity of one of the ribozymes (MRE763C) to cleave only N-ras sequences containing a point mutation at position 763 was examined next. Incubation of MRE763C with a 849-nucleotide-long mutant N-ras transcript resulted in the expected cleavage products of 534 and 315 bases (Fig. 4 A). The same result was obtained for ribozyme MRE764U (data not shown). In contrast, incubation of MRE763C with transcripts containing the wild-type N-ras sequences did not result in any detectable substrate cleavage, demonstrating the absolute specificity of the ribozyme for its substrate in vitro (Fig.4 B). Since the final goal of our experiments was to demonstrate the efficiency of these ribozymes in cell culture, pyrimidine ribonucleotides containing 2′-OH substitutions were used for the synthesis of ribozymes to increase the stability of the oligoribonucleotides against degradation by RNases. Several 2′-modified ribonucleotides such as 2′-O-methyl-2′-deoxyuridine/cytidine, 2′-deoxyuridine/cytidine, or 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine/cytidine were combined with terminal phosphorothioate linkages (see TableIII). The modified ribozymes were incubated in cell culture media at 37 °C for up to 120 h. At specific time points, aliquots were taken from the supernatant, frozen, and dried. The pellets were subsequently resuspended in formamide and analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel. While the unmodified ribozyme was degraded within 30 s, the introduction of three phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′-end of the ribozyme and one at the 5′-end increased the half-life of ribozymes to 2–3 min. Other modifications (e.g.2′-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine) led to an additional increase in stability (Fig. 5 A). Finally, complete substitution of all pyrimidine nucleotides (e.g. 2′-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine) prevented ribozyme degradation for up to 80 h (Fig.5 B). Most of the modified ribozymes were still capable of cleaving the N-ras transcripts. The introduction of the three 3′- and one 5′-terminal phosphorothioate groups led only to a minor decrease in catalytic potency (Table IV). However, the catalytic efficiency of ribozymes containing 2′-fl"
https://openalex.org/W1999007919,"In vivo, transcription factors interact with promoters having complex nucleoprotein structures. The transiently expressed progesterone receptor (PR) efficiently activates a transfected mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter but is a poor activator of the MMTV promoter when it acquires an ordered chromatin structure as an endogenous, replicating gene. We show that the deficiency in PR activity is not due to insufficient expression of either B or A isoforms or competition between the two types of MMTV templates. Rather, this deficiency reflects an inability to induce the chromatin remodeling event that is required for activation of the replicated MMTV template. To determine whether this characteristic is common to transiently expressed steroid receptors or specific to the PR, we examined the activity of transiently expressed glucocorticoid (GR) receptor. Unlike the PR, the transiently expressed GR is an effective activator of both MMTV templates and efficiently induces the necessary chromatin remodeling event at the replicated template. These results indicate that the GR and PR have unique requirements for activation of promoters with ordered chromatin structure. These differences may provide a mechanism for establishing target gene specificity in vivo for steroid receptors that recognize and bind to identical DNA sequences. In vivo, transcription factors interact with promoters having complex nucleoprotein structures. The transiently expressed progesterone receptor (PR) efficiently activates a transfected mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter but is a poor activator of the MMTV promoter when it acquires an ordered chromatin structure as an endogenous, replicating gene. We show that the deficiency in PR activity is not due to insufficient expression of either B or A isoforms or competition between the two types of MMTV templates. Rather, this deficiency reflects an inability to induce the chromatin remodeling event that is required for activation of the replicated MMTV template. To determine whether this characteristic is common to transiently expressed steroid receptors or specific to the PR, we examined the activity of transiently expressed glucocorticoid (GR) receptor. Unlike the PR, the transiently expressed GR is an effective activator of both MMTV templates and efficiently induces the necessary chromatin remodeling event at the replicated template. These results indicate that the GR and PR have unique requirements for activation of promoters with ordered chromatin structure. These differences may provide a mechanism for establishing target gene specificity in vivo for steroid receptors that recognize and bind to identical DNA sequences. In the living cell, transcription and replication take place in the context of chromatin. Factors must interact with promoters and other important DNA regions that have complex nucleoprotein architecture. Inactive genes, particularly those that are tissue-specific, are characterized by chromatin structure which is inaccessible to factors and nucleases (reviewed in Ref. 1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg. 1988; Google Scholar). During development, newly expressed transcription factors must interact with these repressive structures to activate their target promoters. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 1The abbreviations used are: MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; IL2R, interleukin 2 receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; bp, base pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; LTR, long terminal repeat; HA, hemagglutinin; Dex, dexamethasone; GRE, glucocorticoid response element(s). promoter is an in vivo model for the role of chromatin structure in transcription. In its stably replicating form, the MMTV LTR exists as an ordered array of nucleosomes (2Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) that occur along the DNA in a frequency-biased distribution of translational frames (3Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). All of the glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoter are associated with the B family of nucleosome frames. Upon activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) this nucleosome region undergoes a transition in structure, which allows the previously excluded factors NF1 and OTF1 to bind to their sites on the promoter (4Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may involve the loss of histone H1 (6Bresnick E.H. Bustin M. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The GR also either recruits and/or stabilizes the interaction of the TFIID complex with the template (4Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,7Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, analysis of transiently transfected MMTV-reporter constructs has revealed that these templates do not have an ordered nucleosomal repeat, that they are constitutively accessible to NF1, OTF1, and various nucleases, and that GR does not induce any transition in nucleoprotein structure (7Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the GR acts bimodally on the stably replicating template as follows: first, to derepress it through the structural transition and second, to activate it by participating in the formation of an active transcription initiation complex (7Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Since the transient template does not undergo the derepression step, its activity is largely a measure of interactions between soluble factors, and it would not be an adequate model for the interactions of transcription factors with components of ordered chromatin in vivo. Because the two MMTV templates have the same LTR sequences but differ in their nucleoprotein structure, functional differences may represent mechanisms by which ordered chromatin structure participates in regulation of the MMTV promoter. Differences in the behavior of the two templates have been observed in response to butyrate treatment (9Bresnick E.H. John S. Berard D.S. Lefebvre P. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3977-3981Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), activation of cAMP signaling (8Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in the kinetics of GR-induced activation (5Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar functional differences have been observed in other systems (10Bulla G.A. DeSimone V. Cortese R. Fournier R.E. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 316-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Cannon P. Kim S.H. Ulich C. Kim S. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1993-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MMTV promoter can also be activated by progesterone, mineralocorticoid, and androgen receptors, all of which bind to the same DNA sequences (12Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that transiently expressed progesterone receptor (PR) could not efficiently activate the stably replicating template even though it significantly induced transcription from the transient MMTV template (19Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the current study we further characterized the activity of transiently expressed PR using a highly efficient cell sorting method involving antibody-coupled magnetic beads (20Padmanabhan R. Howard T. Gottesman M.M. Howard B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to isolate cells that have taken up exogenous DNA. We find that the deficiency in PR activation of the stably replicating template represents an inability to induce the necessary chromatin remodeling event. We have also asked whether the deficiency in activation of the stably replicating template is specific to the PR or a common feature of transiently expressed receptors by examining the activity of a transiently expressed GR (21Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the PR, transiently expressed GR can activate both MMTV templates efficiently and induce the chromatin remodeling event. These results indicate that there are intrinsic differences in the way the two receptors interact with the stably replicating MMTV template which are not manifested on the transiently transfected template. These differences will provide insight into how this family of receptors, which recognize the same DNA sequence, are able to specifically regulate different sets of genesin vivo. Cell line 1471.1 has been described previously (22Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Eriksson H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Proceedings: 2nd International CBT Symposium on the Steroid/Thyroid Receptor Family and Gene Regulation.Birkhauser Verlag AG, Berlin. 1989; : 221-238Google Scholar). It contains multiple copies of stably replicating MMTV-CAT transcription unit in the context of bovine papilloma virus sequences and expresses GR but not PR. Cell line 904.13 contains 200 copies of stably replicating MMTV-ras transcription unit in the context of bovine papilloma virus sequences and also expresses only GR (3Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 7Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 10% charcoal-stripped serum (Hyclone). Magnetic beads coated with goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Dynal and the magnetic plates from BioMag. Various monoclonal antibodies directed against the interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R) were obtained from Amersham Corp., Boehringer Mannheim, and Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. Previously described plasmids used in this study are as follows: pcPRO (chicken PR expression vector) (23Gronemeyer H. Turcotte B. Quirin-Stricker C. Bocquel M.T. Meyer M.E. Krozowski Z. Jeltsch J.M. Lerouge T. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3985-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), pLTRluc (full-length MMTV LTR driving luciferase) (24Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and pCMVIL2R (IL2R expression vector) (25Giordano T. Howard T.H. Coleman J. Sakamoto K. Howard B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MMTV-reporter construct pMTVbgln consists of the full-length LTR (−1187 to +103 bp) driving the expression of the rabbit β-globin gene. It was made by inserting aDra I/Bam HI fragment from pM18 (2Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) containing the LTR region into pMggnOVEC (kindly provided by S. Rusconi) digested withSma I and Bam HI to remove MMTV LTR sequences from a different MMTV strain. The resulting plasmid contained the MMTV LTR fused to β-globin coding sequence from the second exon. To restore the first exon and intron of the β-globin gene, a polymerase chain reaction fragment containing these sequences was inserted. The C656G expression vector, pCI-nH6HA-C656G, was made by insertion of the C656G cDNA (21Chakraborti P.K. Garabedian M.J. Yamamoto K.R. Simons Jr., S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22075-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by S. Simons) into pCI-nH6HA. This plasmid is derived from pCI (Promega) into which the sequence (sense strand) 5′ GCTAGCGAAGGAGATCCGCCATGGCCCACCATCACCACCATCACGGATATCCATACGACGTGCCAGATTACGCTCAGCTGGAATTC 3′ was inserted at the Nhe I and Eco RI sites. This sequence contains an initial methionine codon, six histidines, and the hemagglutinin A (HA) epitope. The cDNA was inserted such that the receptor would be expressed with the histidine tag and the HA epitope at its amino terminus. Both the CMV and T7 promoters lie upstream of the cDNA. The high level expression vector for the PR, pnH6HA-cPR(B), was made by inserting anEco RV/Kpn I fragment containing the entire coding sequence of the chicken PR except for the first methionine into the Pvu II and Kpn I sites in the polylinker of pCI-nH6HAfs2, a frameshift variant of pCI-nH6HA. The β-actin plasmid (pT7B-Actn-F) used to make the S1 probe contains a 91-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment from the second exon of the mouse β-actin gene in pT7Blue (Novagen). Cell line 1471.1 was transfected by either calcium phosphate coprecipitation using BES-based buffers (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar) or electroporation. Briefly, cells were transfected with a combination of plasmids. In every case (unless noted) transfection was carried out with the IL2R expression vector along with an MMTV-reporter construct (either pLTRluc or pMTVbgln) and a receptor expression vector (pcPRO, pCI-nH6HA-C656G, or pnH6HA-cPR(B)). Amounts of each DNA used are indicated in the figure legends. Electroporation was carried out in a Cell-porator (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 250 V, 800 microfarads with aliquots of 2 × 107 cells in 300 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were plated after electroporation and were treated and harvested the following day. Transfection by calcium phosphate coprecipitation using BES-based buffers was carried out overnight at 37 °C, 2.9% CO2 on 10-cm dishes (7 × 105 cells), each receiving a total of 20 μg of DNA. The following day cells were re-fed and transferred to 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were treated and harvested 2 days after transfection. Magnetic affinity sorting was carried out as described with some modification (20Padmanabhan R. Howard T. Gottesman M.M. Howard B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Prior to sorting goat anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads were mixed with IL2R monoclonal antibody at a ratio of 50 mg bead suspension to 50 μg antibody. Beads were diluted in Medium S (4 mm EGTA, 100 μg/ml chondroitin sulfate, 0.1% gelatin, 10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 8 mg/ml non-fat dry milk, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, all in PBS without Ca2+ or Mg2+) at a ratio of 15 μl bead suspension (50 mg/ml) to 1 ml Medium S. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Medium S/bead mixture for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed again with PBS and harvested by brief trypsinization followed by neutralization with trypsin inhibitor. Flasks containing the cells were placed between magnetic plates to separate the beaded cells from the unbeaded cells. The two resulting cell pools were washed several times with PBS, pelleted, and frozen for later analysis. RNA was isolated from cell pools and subjected to S1 nuclease digestion (8–10 μg of RNA per sample) as described previously (19Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), except pMTVbgln digested with Sac I and pT7B-Actn-F digested with eitherEco RI or Spe I were used as templates to make single-stranded probes by multiple rounds of linear primer extension with Taq polymerase and short oligonucleotides homologous to β-globin or β-actin coding sequences. S1 digestion products were separated on 8% denaturing gels that were dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens. All quantitation was carried out using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Cell extracts used in assays for CAT and luciferase activity were made from sorted cell pools by resuspension of cell pellets in 0.25m Tris, pH 7.5, and three cycles of freezing and thawing. Cellular debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was used in the assays. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using protein assay dye (Bio-Rad). Five μg of cellular extract protein from each sample was used for CAT analysis (27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Visualization of the products was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and quantitation with ImageQuant software. Luciferase assays were carried out as described previously (24Lefebvre P. Berard D.S. Cordingley M.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that a Microlumat LB 96 P (EGG Berthold) machine was used to measure the luminescence. All values for luciferase activity were normalized to the amount of cellular protein used for each sample. Cytosolic extracts for immunoblotting of steroid receptors were made as follows. Cells from sorted pools were washed with PBS, pelleted, and resuspended in HEGDM (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and a protease inhibitor mixture (0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Cell membranes were allowed to lyse for several minutes, and nuclei and cellular debris were pelleted 5 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (3% stacking gel, 8% separating gel) and transferred to Immobilon or Hybond nitrocellulose (Amersham Corp.) for 3–4 h in Tris glycine buffer with 20% methanol at 300 mA. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in either Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2) containing 2% nonfat dry milk (for anti-GR, -PR antibodies) or 2.5% blocking reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) in 100 mm maleic acid, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl (for anti-HA antibody). Incubation with primary antibodies was carried out overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies include PA512 (Affinity Bioreagents) against the GR, 12CA5 (kindly provided by W. Dixon and J. Campbell) against the HA epitope, and PR22 (kindly provided by D. Toft) against both isoforms of the chicken PR. Blots were washed several times with TBS containing either 0.1% Tween 20 (for anti-GR, -PR antibodies) or 0.4% Tween 20 (for anti-HA antibody) before exposure to the appropriate secondary antibody for 2 h. Blots were washed as above and exposed to reagents provided in an ECL or ECF kit (Amersham Corp.). In the case of detection by enhanced chemiluminescence, the membranes were exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) for 1 min or less. For analysis with ECF, membranes were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 instrument in the blue fluorescence mode. Cells transfected with the IL2R expression vector and either pcPRO, pCI-nH6HA-C656G, or pnH6HA-cPR(B) were treated with hormones for 1 h in Medium S. Antibody-coated beads were added 15 min before harvest. Cells were harvested by brief trypsinization and neutralization with trypsin inhibitor. After a brief sort, nuclei were isolated from sorted cell populations as described previously (8Pennie W.D. Hager G.L. Smith C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2125-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sac I digestion of nuclei was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min in 50 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% glycerol at a Sac I concentration of 10 units per μg of DNA. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml proteinase K. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol extraction and digested to completion with Dpn II. An end-labeled oligonucleotide containing MMTV-transcribed sequences (+1 to +27 bp) was used in multiple rounds of linear amplification withTaq polymerase to detect digestion products. We have designed a system in which the activity of transiently expressed steroid receptors can be monitored on two types of MMTV templates. The first stably replicates, being either episomal or integrated, and consists of the full-length LTR driving expression of the CAT gene (22Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Marsaud V. Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. Gustafsson J.A. Eriksson H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Proceedings: 2nd International CBT Symposium on the Steroid/Thyroid Receptor Family and Gene Regulation.Birkhauser Verlag AG, Berlin. 1989; : 221-238Google Scholar). Its chromatin structure is characterized by an ordered array of non-randomly positioned nucleosomes (2Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Fragoso G. John S. Roberts M.S. Hager G.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1933-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The access of general transcription factors such as NF1 and OTF1 to this template is largely inhibited in the absence of hormone (4Cordingley M.G. Riegel A.T. Hager G.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 261-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 5Lee H.-L. Archer T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 32-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reflecting a structure that is repressive to transcription. The activated GR binds to its sites that lie within the B family of nucleosomes and causes a structural transition that results in a more open and accessible structure (2Richard-Foy H. Hager G.L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 28Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The second template is a transiently transfected reporter construct consisting of the full-length LTR driving the expression of the luciferase or β-globin genes. Its nucleoprotein structure is characterized by the lack of an ordered nucleosome repeat and a constitutively open conformation, which allows access of transcription factors NF1 and OTF1 in the absence of hormone (7Archer T.K. Lefebvre P. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Science. 1992; 255: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Activated GR does not induce any apparent transition in structure but does cause the increased association of the TFIID complex with the template. Since these two types of MMTV template have the same LTR sequence, differences in their function are most likely a result of their differing structures. To measure the activity of transfected receptors on stably replicating templates, it was necessary to sort the transfected cells into a fraction enriched in those cells that express the exogenous DNA, because the receptors are expressed in only a fraction of the total cell population. In our previous study (19Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) this was accomplished by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, a lengthy procedure that was limited for the number of conditions examined. In this study we have employed a highly efficient magnetic affinity-based cell sorting procedure (20Padmanabhan R. Howard T. Gottesman M.M. Howard B.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Cells containing stably replicating MMTV templates were transfected with an MMTV-reporter construct, a receptor expression vector, and an expression vector for the Tac subunit (29Waldmann T.A. Science. 1986; 232: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) of interleukin 2 receptor (IL2R). Monoclonal antibodies that recognize the extracellular region of the IL2R subunit were used to coat magnetic beads with anti-mouse immunoglobulins attached. These beads bound only to cells that took up exogenous DNA and expressed the IL2R. After trypsinization, the beaded cells were separated from the non-transfected cells with the use of magnets. The cell pools were then used as sources of RNA, DNA, or cytosolic fractions. The IL2R-expressing population of cells is highly enriched for the transient template and the transiently expressed receptor. Previously we determined that, unlike endogenous GR, transiently expressed PR was not able to significantly activate an integrated MMTV template (19Smith C.L. Archer T.K. Hamlin-Green G. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11202-11206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, a transient MMTV template was efficiently activated by PR. Because of the length of the FACS-based sorting procedure, we could not, in the same experiment, sort dexamethasone (Dex)-treated cells in addition to non-treated and R5020-treated cells. Therefore, we were unable to directly compare the abilities of the endogenous GR and the transiently expressed PR to activate the transient template. Since its nucleoprotein structure is non-ordered and accessible, activation of the transient template is most likely a reflection of interactions between soluble factors and DNA rather than between soluble factors and chromatin components. Therefore, the activity of the various receptors on this template is a measure of their potential as transactivators at the MMTV promoter in a given cell type. Determination of relative transactivation potentials is important for assessing the abilities of various receptors to activate the stably replicating template and evaluating the impact of nucleoprotein architecture on this process. Using the magnetic affinity cell sorting procedure, we examined the activity of the transiently expressed PR relative to the endogenous GR. Cells were transfected with expression vectors for the IL2R and the chicken PR as well as an MMTV/β-globin reporter construct. After sorting, RNA was isolated and analyzed by S1 nuclease protection assay with a probe that differentiates between transcripts generated from the stably replicating and transient MMTV templates. Also included was a probe to detect β-actin transcripts that served as an internal standard. Fig. 2 A shows a representative experiment. Both the endogenous GR and the transiently expressed PR activated the transient MMTV template to approximately the same extent. However, whereas the GR induced a large increase in the level of mRNA generated from the stably replicating template (40-fold in this experiment), the PR induced only a weak response (4-fold). Fig.2 B shows the average relative activities of the two receptors from multiple experiments. The transiently expressed PR is approximately 7 times less active than the endogenous GR on the stable template but is just as efficient in activating the transient template. One possible explanation for the differential in transactivation is that the two template types compete for the PR, the transient template being more successful, perhaps given its quantity or more accessible structure. Therefore, we carried out the same experiment in the absence of the MMTV-reporter construct. Fig. 2 C shows that the PR was still a weak activator (5-fold induction in this experiment) of the stable template. Therefore, the function of the PR at the stably replicating template is independent of the relative amounts of templates present and reflects a true deficiency in activity uniquely associated with some property of the stably replicated template. To determine whether the concentration of PR in the transfected cells affected its ability to transactivate the two templates, titration of the transfected PR expression vector was carried out. Increasing amounts were transfected into 1471.1 cells along with the IL2R expression vector, and an MMTV-reporter construct, in which the full-length LTR directs expression of luciferase. Fig.3, A and B, shows the titration curves for the stably replicating and transient MMTV templates. In each case the induction by Dex remained relatively constant over the range of PR expression vector transfected. For the transient template, inductions by R5020 increased (reaching the level of Dex inductions), peaked, and then declined, probably due to squelching. In the case of the stable template, R5020 inductions increased initially and then plateaued at a low level, approximately 20% of the Dex induction, which correlates well with the RNA data shown in Fig. 2 B. An immunoblot of cytosols from transfected cells shows the accumulation of PR as the amount of expression vector transfected increased (Fig.3 C). The ex"

Their functional interdependence has been suggested by the analysis of theSp-delayed (Sp d) mouse mutant, in which a glycine to arginine substitution at position 9 of the paired-domain abrogates DNA binding by both domains. This glycine is located in the β-turn portion of a β-hairpin motif, and the requirement for this structure was investigated by mutagenesis at this and neighboring positions. At position 9, only substitution with proline increased DNA binding by the paired-domain and homeodomain above the level observed with the Sp d arginine mutation, suggesting that the β-turn is necessary for the function of both DNA-binding domains. Alanine scanning mutagenesis also identified a number of flanking residues important for DNA binding by both domains, emphasizing the requirement of the β-hairpin for the interaction of Pax-3 with DNA. Furthermore, we show that these mutations reduce binding by the homeodomain at the monomeric level and do not impair dimerization on a TAAT(N)2ATTA consensus motif. In contrast, the wild-type paired-domain was found to prevent dimerization on consensus motifs with 3-base pair spacing of the type TAAT(N)3ATTA. Importantly, both the deleterious effect of the Sp dmutation on homeodomain DNA binding and the loss of dimerization on TAAT(N)3ATTA motifs can be transferred to a heterologous homeodomain from the human phox protein. Moreover, the presence of the paired-domain affects sequence discrimination within the 3-base pair spacer in this context. These analyses establish that the β-hairpin motif is essential for paired-domain and homeodomain DNA binding, and suggest a novel mechanism by which the paired-domain can influence sequence specificity of the homeodomain within the Pax-3 polypeptide."

It is found in the extracellular matrix of tracheal, nasal, and articular cartilage and is also synthesized by Swarm rat chondrosarcoma cells (2Morgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol.

The rat and human sequences contain several regions that show a high homology with the thrombospondins, having a series of four contiguous type 2 epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats followed by a series of seven type 3 calcium binding domains. There is also an RGD cell-binding motif in human, but not in rat COMP. This is also present in bovine COMP, for which a partial sequence is available (4Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human COMP gene is located on chromosome 19p13.1 (5Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Laweler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The interactions between the COMP subunits that give rise to the pentameric structure are mediated by an α-helical portion of the protein close to the N terminus. Oligomerization is independent of disulfide bond formation although these interactions stabilize the assembled structure (6Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Recently (6Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) the crystal structure of the oligomerization domain of COMP was described. This structure consists of a bundle of five α-helical strands, each 46 residues in length, that form a parallel coiled coil. The resulting structure is a pore that may act as an ion channel, but the hydrophilic outer surface of this structure indicates that it is not a transmembrane domain (6Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A.

During development of the rat femoral head, COMP shows a predominant pericellular and territorial distribution around chondrocytes in the cartilage extracellular matrix and in the growth plate (7Shen Z. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 773-781Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As the secondary center of ossification forms, COMP protein disappears from the calcified tissues but persists in the growth plate. In the mature articular cartilage, COMP is prominent both in its mRNA levels, as studied by in situ hybridization, and in protein abundance. Interestingly, the protein is primarily found within the interterritorial matrix compartment at this stage (7Shen Z. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 773-781Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This observation may indicate different roles of COMP in immature and adult tissue. During limb chondrogenesis in mice, COMP expression begins at an early stage, where it is seen in the peripheral region of the developing humerus as the 100 kDa subunit protein (8Franzen Heinegård D. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1987; 36: 199Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Later, it is more uniformly distributed throughout the cartilaginous layer. These observations suggest that COMP, because of its early expression during cartilage development, may play a role in the assembly of the extracellular matrix. The importance of the role that COMP plays in cartilage development is underscored by the observation that mutations in the COMP gene give rise to pseudoachondroplasia (9Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M.G. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenwesier H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman RS. Gaines ES. Cekleniak J.A. Knowlton R.G. Cohn D.H. Nat.

These mutations occur within the type 3 calcium-binding repeats, suggesting an essential role for COMP in calcium-mediated interactions. COMP has three sites of potential N-glycosylation (4Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A.

Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), asparagines 101, 124, and 722 (the residue numbers refer to human COMP), but the extent to which they are substituted has not been determined. The role of carbohydrate substituents in modulating the interactions and stability of extracellular proteins has been well described. In some cases, the nature and degree of substitution varies with the developmental state. For example, aggrecan, which is an abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, has several sites ofN-glycosylation within the N-terminal globular G1 domain that become substituted with sulfated polylactosamine chains during maturation (11Barry F.P.

In this report, the results of studies on the distribution and structure of carbohydrate substituents in bovine and human COMP, using chemical analysis and mass spectrometry, are described. It is shown that there are some important maturation-related differences in the structure of the N-linked sugars. COMP was purified from mature bovine articular cartilage obtained from the metacarpalphalangeal joints by dissociative extraction (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa-Pimentel E. Sommarin E. Wendel M. Oldberg A. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this involved cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation of the 4 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) cartilage extract. The fraction of lowest buoyant density (1.35 g/ml), representing one-fourth of the total volume, was collected, dialyzed against water, and concentrated by drying. The concentrate was applied to a Superose 6 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and eluted with 4 m GdnHCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. The material recovered from the void volume peak was dialyzed and applied to a Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-Cl, 7 m urea, 0.15 mNaCl, pH 7.4. Elution was with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0.15m to 1.5 m. Human COMP was prepared from femoral head cartilage from a 35-year-old individual using the same procedure. COMP was also prepared from steer fetlock cartilage and from third trimester bovine fetuses. COMP was reduced and alkylated by standard methods (12Allen G. Sequencing of Proteins and Peptides. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1989Google Scholar). Digestion with lysine-C proteinase (Wako BioProducts, Richmond, VA) or with trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) was carried out at 30 °C using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 or at 37 °C using an enzyme substrate ratio of 1:100, respectively, in 0.1m Tris-Cl, pH 8.5. Peptides were separated by chromatography on a Vydac (Hesperia, CA) 2.1 × 250 mm C18 column on a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA) 1090L HPLC system. The column was equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water. Elution was with a gradient of acetonitrile (0–55% solvent B in 55 min, 55–100% solvent B in 20 min; solvent B was 70% acetonitrile, 0.85% TFA). Digestion with recombinant N-glycanase (Genzyme, Inc., Cambridge MA) was carried out at 37 °C in 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, using 250 milliunits of enzyme and 20 pmol peptide. For monosaccharide analysis, samples were hydrolyzed in the liquid phase in the presence of either 2m TFA or 4 m HCl at 100 °C for 3 and 5 h, respectively. To check for losses of monosaccharides during hydrolysis, fetuin was used as a control and was hydrolyzed under conditions identical to those used for COMP. Analysis was carried out on a Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) LC500 system using a PA-1 column (13Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Detection was by pulsed amperometry using a Dionex ED-40 system. This was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard G2025A instrument in the positive ion mode. 10 μl of matrix solution was mixed with 1 μl of sample, and a 0.7-μl aliquot was dried under vacuum. Crystal formation was monitored using the Hewlett-Packard G2024A sample prep station. For intact proteins, the matrix used was sinapinic acid (Hewlett Packard), approximately 100 shots were summed and the total laser irradiance was 5–6 μJ. For peptides derived from proteolytic digests, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Hewlett Packard) was used as matrix, approximately 30 shots were summed, and the total laser irradiance was 0.6–1.0 μJ. An alternative method for sample preparation was carried out as follows. Sample and matrix were applied as already described and allowed to dry, and then 0.7 μl of a formic acid solution (water:acetonitrile:formic acid 100:100:35) was overlaid and allowed to dry. 2A. Woods, personal communication. Protein sequencing was carried out using a Hewlett-Packard G1000A protein sequencer using Routine 3.0 methods. For lectin blotting, COMP was reduced and carboxymethylated, separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar), and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was probed with lectins SNA (15Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekart W.F. Nsimba-Lubakis M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MAA (16Wang W.-C. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the CHO kit (Boehringer Mannheim), with bovine fetuin as the standard. Analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of reduced and carboxymethylated COMP from adult human articular cartilage indicated a protonated subunit molecular mass of 86949 ± 149 Da (the average of three measurements, Fig. 1upper spectrum). The predicted value was 83547.0 Da (5Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Laweler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with the mass difference of 3402 ± 149 Da indicating a low level of post-translational addition. The carboxymethylated subunit protonated molecular mass of COMP prepared by associative extraction from adult bovine articular cartilage was 86560 ± 163 Da (Fig. 1,lower spectrum), close to the value obtained for human COMP. There is a high degree of homology between the bovine, rat, and human sequences (4Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Laweler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in the region where comparisons may be made (residues 299–737 of human COMP, or 59% of the sequence). It was assumed that there is an equally high homology between the sequences in the regions where a direct comparison is not possible. Therefore, many of the mapping studies described here were carried out using bovine COMP and related to predictions made by comparison with the human and rat sequences. Bovine COMP was digested with lysine-C proteinase, and the peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.2A). Several peptides were collected and identified by N-terminal sequencing, MALDI-TOF mass analysis, or both. These are referred to as peptides K-1 through K-17 (TableI). Of particular interest was peptide K-17, with a protonated mass of 11744.3 ± 3.3 Da. The N-terminal sequence was identified as LTVRPLSQCRPGFCFPGVAXTXT by Edman degradation. When aligned with the human COMP sequence (5Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Laweler J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), this peptide corresponds to residues 62–155. This peptide carries two putativeN-glycosylation sites, at Asn-101 and Asn-124. The protonated mass was reduced to 9897.1 ± 3.3 Da by digestion withN-glycanase, a difference of 1847.2 ± 6.6 (Fig.2B). This peptide was digested with trypsin and fractionated by HPLC (Fig. 3A). The tryptic peptides, referred to as T-1 through T-4, were identified by N-terminal sequencing, and their protonated masses were determined by MALDI-TOF MS, with and without treatment with N-glycanase. The results for peptides T-1 and T-3 are shown in Fig. 3, B andC and are summarized in Table I. One of these peptides (peptide T-1, with sequence CGPCPEGFTGXGSHCADVNECXAHP …, corresponding to residues 91–121 of the human sequence, see Table I) was reduced by 1849.8 Da after N-glycanase treatment. The mass of peptide T-3, which contains the other putativeN-linkage site with sequence CINTSPGFRCEACPPGFSGPTHEXV …, corresponding to residues 122–152 of human COMP, agrees with the calculated mass and was unchanged byN-glycanase treatment. These results indicate that, of the two possible sites of N-glycosylation on peptide K-17, Asn-101 is glycosylated and Asn-124 is not.Table ISequence and mass data for peptides derived from a lysine-C proteinase digest of reduced and carboxymethylated adult bovine COMP and of the peptides separated after tryptic subdigestion of the N-linked oligopeptide K-17Lysine-C proteinase peptidesPeptide1-aPeptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (see Fig. 2A) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” eluted peaks were collected, and their protonated mass determined by MALDI-TOF.Retention timeMeasured massN-terminal sequence1-bThe number preceding each sequence is the residue number of the corresponding sequence of human COMP (5).minDaK-18.9951396.9(260)LRCSERQERKK-211.0761827.5(341)DTDGDGK-312.1281498.40(324)WGDACDK-413.532102.2ND1-cND, not determined.K-516.162116.10(306)DNCPLVRK-618.7013547.70(394)SNADQRDVDH…HQDSKK-720.1201493.70(17)ELQETNAALQDVR2077.00(44)NTVMECDACGMQPARTK-821.5572847.80(345)DGRGDAXDDDK-925.8883795.50(270)DNCVTVPNSGQEDXDRDR7374.40(426)DNCPTVPNSAQQDK-1027.0801716.90(622)SXTGXGEQLRN7360.10(426)DNCPTVPNSAQQDSK-1131.3717672.30(156)QVCTDINECETGQHNCVPNXVCVK-1232.456ND1-cND, not determined.(497)IDXXPENK-1333.2093328.00(122)CINTS…TFAKK-1435.6722723.90(596)QMEQTYWQANK-1536.1904335.10(221)ADCVLERDGSRSCVCK-1636.694335.10(221)ADCVLERDGSRSCVCK-1740.111744.3(62)LTVR…Tryptic subfragments of peptide K-17PeptideRetention timeMeasured massMass after N-glycanaseSequenceminDaT-125.715149.33299.5(91)CGPCPEGFTGXGSHCADVNECXAHPT-229.762295.32293.5(131)CEACPPGFSGPTHEGVGVT-333.293327.03326.7(122)CINTSPGFRCEACPPGFSGPTHEXVT-435.183060.33060.3(62)LTVRPLSQXSPGFXF1-a Peptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC (see Fig. 2A) as described under “Experimental Procedures,” eluted peaks were collected, and their protonated mass determined by MALDI-TOF.1-b The number preceding each sequence is the residue number of the corresponding sequence of human COMP (5Newton G.

This mass spectrum differed somewhat from that obtained for adult bovine COMP (Fig. 1) and suggested that the fetal protein may carry a different substitution pattern. Both adult and fetal bovine COMP were digested with lysine C-proteinase and separated by reversed phase HPLC. The chromatograms, shown in Fig.5, indicate two areas where a difference can be seen between the adult and fetal samples. These are marked with bold arrows. The adult COMP digest showed an additional peak, at 32.65 min, not present in the fetal sample; furthermore, there was a side-peak at 46 min, unique to the fetal digest. Fraction 1 was separated using the same HPLC column and shown by peptide sequencing to contain two peptides, 270–305 and 426–492 (Table III, numbering refers to the human COMP sequence). The C-terminal portions of the peptides was extrapolated using the measured protonated mass for each and the sequence of bovine COMP, which is known in these regions (4Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These derive from repeats 1 and 6, respectively, of the calcium binding domain of COMP. The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of the adult COMP fraction (Fig. 6A) showed an ion of protonated mass 3821.8 ± 0.8 Da, which was absent in the fetal COMP fraction. It is likely that this peptide is a variant of peptide 270–305.Figure 5HPLC separation of lysine-C proteinase digests of adult (upper spectrum) and fetal (lower spectrum) bovine COMP.

Chem. 1988; 263: 4576-4585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced and carboxymethylated adult bovine COMP was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto PVDF (Fig. 7). Reaction was detected with SNA and not with MAA, indicating the presence of α2–6-linked sialic acid. In these mapping experiments, the peptide carrying the third potentialN-glycosylation site at Asn-722 was not isolated. One possible explanation for this would be that the protein core in the COMP preparations used was truncated and did not posses an intact C-terminal end. This could lead to the loss of Asn-722, which is located within 16 residues of the mature C terminus. An experiment was therefore conducted to establish that the COMP preparations used in this study had the predicted C terminus. Reduced and carboxymethylated human COMP was digested with aspartate-N proteinase and the unseparated digest was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. One of the peptides identified had a protonated mass of 1814.6 ± 0.5 Da (Fig. 8), consistent with the C-terminal peptide (DTIPEDYETHQLRQA), with predicted mass of 1816.92 Da. This indicated that the C terminus was not in fact truncated. Analysis of human COMP by MALDI-TOF MS following treatment with a variety of glycosidases (Fig. 9) was carried out. Treatment of the reduced and carboxymethylated monomer withN-glycanase led to a reduction in mass of 3571 ± 219 Da. Further treatment with neuraminidase and O-glycanase did not lead to any significant reduction in mass, indicating the absence of O-linked oligosaccharides. The mass difference resulting from N-glycanase treatment, however, was consistent with the presence of 2 N-linked oligosaccharides. Since Asn-101 carries a substituent of average mass of 1847.2 ± 6.6 Da, and Asn-124 is unsubstituted, the additional N-linked oligosaccharide resides on Asn-722. We have used MALDI-TOF and chemical analysis to obtain detailed information on the structure and distribution of carbohydrate moieties on COMP. On the basis of the data presented, it is concluded that in adult COMP there are two sites of N-glycosylation at Asn-101 and Asn-721. The third N-linkage site (Asn-124) is unoccupied. The difference between the measured mass and that predicted from the sequence of human COMP indicated that the mass of all post-translationally added groups was 3402 ± 149 Da. Analysis of the total neutral monosaccharide and hexosamine content (Table II) indicated that carbohydrate would account for all of these substituents since they contribute an additional mass of 3700–4300 Da, depending on the degree of acetylation of hexosamine residues, to the mass of the COMP subunit. The mass of the N-oligosaccharide at Asn-101 was estimated to be 1847.2 ± 6.6, and this is consistent with the expected mass of a high mannose oligosaccharide such as that indicated in Table IV, with the structure (HexNAc)2-(Man)8-(Fuc)1. The oligosaccharide on Asn-721 had a mass of 1723.8 ± 225 Da. The error associated with this measurement means that a number of interpretations can be made, but the structure must contain sufficient glucosamine and sialic acid to account for the presence of these sugars, as measured by monosaccharide analysis and lectin blotting.Table IVOligosaccharide composition of peptide K-17 (Asn-101) from bovine adult and fetal COMP determined by MALDI-TOF MS and monosaccharide analysis dataGlycopeptide mass4-aThe glycopeptide masses are taken from Figs.2B and 6B, respectively.Difference from deglycosylated peptide4-bThe protonated masses of the deglycosylated adult and fetal K-17 peptides are 9897.1 ± 3.3 and 9896.6 ± 8.6 Da, respectively.Addition to core structure4-cThe core oligosaccharide structure of (GlcNAc)2-(Man)3 is assumed.

Open table in a new tab In fetal COMP, the oligosaccharide substituent at Asn-101 exists in several structural forms (Fig. 6B). The most likely structural arrangements of oligosaccharide substituents that would give rise to this cluster are shown in Table IV. As in the case of the adult structure, the masses are consistent with a core structure of (GlcNAc)2-(Man)3 and additional substitutions that contain fucose, sialic acid, glucosamine, and mannose residues. Addition of these outer chain structures occurs in the trans region of the Golgi prior to secretion (17Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3762) Google Scholar), and the final oligosaccharide structure depends on the rate at which the protein core moves through the Golgi apparatus. It may be that in fetal tissue there is an additional level of tight regulation relating to the rate of movement of the protein through the Golgi. This may in turn regulate exactly where the molecule is located in the extracellular matrix since changes in glycosylation may influence binding to other matrix components. COMP has been shown by immunohistochemical analysis to be distributed throughout the pericellular and territorial environments in developing cartilage and the interritorial compartment in mature cartilage (7Shen Z. Heinegård D. Sommarin Y. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 773-781Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These age-related changes could also reflect differences in the content or binding affinity of COMP binding molecules in these compartments. It is very likely that the changes in glycosylation of COMP described here allow for different intermolecular interactions.

Overexpressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tumor cell surfaces is associated with enhanced cell attachment and migration into extracellular matrices, which promotes tumor aggressiveness. We have demonstrated that epidermal growth factor (EGF) up-regulates the cell surface adhesion molecule CD44 at both the mRNA and protein levels on mouse fibroblasts expressing full-length wild-type EGFR (NR6-WT) but not on EGFR-deficient cells (NR6-P). This increases cell attachment to hyaluronic acid. In this investigation, transcriptional regulation of CD44 by EGF was confirmed by defining an EGF-regulatory element. By employing human CD44 gene promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) constructs transfected into NR6-WT cells, EGF inducibility was observed within a 120-base pair (bp) DNA fragment located 450 bp upstream of the RNA initiation site. Differential EGF inducibility was found among different cell lines chosen, indicating a 3.2- and 1.8-fold enhancement in DU145 cells carrying exogenous wild-type EGFR and in MCF-7 cells, respectively, while minimal EGF induction was found in cervical cancer HeLa cells. Utilizing gel shift assays, a time-dependent increase of DNA-protein complex formation was found upon EGF stimulation in NR6-WT cells but not in NR6-P cells. Based upon these observations, a novel 22-bp EGF regulatory element (ERE) (5′-−604CCCTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCC−583-3′) was isolated from the CD44 gene promoter. This ERE conferred DNA-protein binding ability in vitro, as well as the full functional recovery of EGF inducibility of CAT activity when linked to a homologous CD44 promoter or a SV40 promoter driving a CAT reporter gene. A two-base mutation of the ERE completely eliminated its binding activity as well as its EGF inducibility of CAT expression. Our studies indicate that EGF induces CD44 gene expression through an interaction between a specific ERE and putative novel transcriptional factor so as to regulate cell attachment to extracellular matrix.

However, these sequences do not connote a specific ERE. Structural analysis of the CD44 upstream regulatory region in human neuroblastoma cells (27Shtivelman E. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11 ()): 5446-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) revealed that there were neither typical TATA nor CCAAT boxes in the promoter region, although approximately 150 bp adjacent to the 5′-end of the gene itself was sufficient to induce substantial basal transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Despite the existence of three consensus hexanucleotide GGGCGG sequences, Sp1 binding to the CD44 gene upstream region has not been demonstrated. Rather, the cis-regulatory element, which was known to contribute to the down-regulation of CD44 in neuroblastoma cells, was identified as being a 120-bp DNA fragment located 450 bp upstream of the RNA initiation site. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanism by which EGF regulates CD44 gene expression, we investigated transcriptional regulation of CD44 gene by EGF using the bacterial CAT reporter system. Both in vitro DNA-protein binding ability and in vivo EGF inducibility were examined in both wild-type as well as mutational EREs. Herein, we report the existence of a transferable 22-nucleotide sequence which confers EGF responsiveness to transcriptional units. Parental murine NR6 cells (P), which are 3T3 derivatives devoid of endogenous EGFR (28Pruss R.M. Herschman H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 114: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). These cell lines have been previously characterized, and are maintained at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2environment, in minimal essential medium-α (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 1 × non-essential amino acid and sodium pyruvate with 350 μg/ml G418 as a selective marker for the NR6-WT cells. Cells were carefully passaged before they reached 90% confluence to eliminate spontaneous morphological change. EGF induction was accomplished with 10 nm EGF (Life Technologies, Inc.) in complete medium containing 0.1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for different time periods. Other cell lines used were: DU145 carrying exogenous wild-type EGFR (31Xie H. Wang M.H. Turner T. Singh R.K. Siegal G.P. Wells A. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1995; 13: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 7.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1 mg/ml G418 as a selective marker; MCF-7 and HeLa cells were maintained according to recommendations from the ATCC. Preparation of nuclei and RNA labeling followed standard protocols (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Curr. Protocols Mol. Biol. 1990; 2: 4.10.1-9Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 108 NR6-P or NR6-WT cells were treated with 10 nm EGF for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 12 h, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and preincubated in cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 3 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmMgCl2). The cells were resuspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer followed by further lysis in 2 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer (addition of 1% Nonidet P-40 to the lysis buffer) before disruption by 10 strokes in a cold Dounce homogenizer. Disruption was confirmed by light microscopic evaluation after trypan blue staining. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g, at 4 °C for 5 min, and then resuspended in ice-cold glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.3), 40% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm EDTA) followed by immediate return to dry ice before being stored at −70 °C for later use. Elongation of nascent RNA from 5 × 107 nuclei was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in 200 μl of 2 × reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 35 units of RNasin, and 1 mm each of CTP, ATP, and GTP) in the presence of 10 μl of [α-32P]UTP (760 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml, Amersham). After treatment with 24 μg of DNase I (Sigma) for 15 min at 30 °C and 10 μg of proteinase K for 30 min at 42 °C, labeled RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitants were then applied to Whatman GF/A glass fibers which were further washed 3 times with 10 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate and incubated in 1.5 ml of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) in the presence of 40 μg of DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA was eluted by heating the mixture to 65 °C for 10 min after adding 45 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 68 μl of 20% SDS and then treating with 10 μg of proteinase K at 37 °C for 30 min, before precipitating with 0.1 volume of 3m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of ethanol. Aliquots of ∼4–5 × 106 cpm of labeled RNA in 1 ml of TES solution (10 mm TES (pH 7.4), 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% SDS) were hybridized to nitrocellulose membranes previously dot-blotted with 5 μg of denatured and linealized plasmid DNA containing CD44 cDNA, α-actinin cDNA, or vector DNA in the presence of 1 ml of TES/NaCl solution (0.6 m NaCl + TES solution) at 65 °C for 36 h. After washing twice in 25 ml of 2 × SSC for 1 h at 65 °C followed by 8 μg of RNase A treatment at 37 °C for 30 min, nitrocellulose strips were then unraveled and exposed to x-ray film. Plasmids containing different fragments of the human CD44 gene regulatory region placed upstream of the bacterial CAT gene (pCATbasic, Stratagene) (27Shtivelman E. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11 ()): 5446-5453Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) were a kind gift from Dr. Emma Shtivelman (SYSTEMIX, CA). Specifically, these plasmids were: pRBCAT with 1.9 kilobases of genomic CD44 sequences extending upstream from theBam HI site in the first exon; pSacBCAT and pRVBCAT were 5′ truncated versions of pRBCAT, with 0.65- and 0.53-kilobase inserts upstream of the CAT gene, respectively; and pRB-SRCAT which was a deletion version of the pRBCAT sequence in which a 120-bp fragment between the Sac I and Eco RV sites were excluded (illustrated in Fig. 2). To further define the putative ERE, three repeats (22 bp, 5′-CCCTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCC-3′) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction methods from a synthesized oligonucleotide template (5′-ACCCAAGCTTCGCCCTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCCGCATGCGTCGACCGCCCTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCCGCTAGCCGCCTTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCCGTCGACGAT-3′) using the 5′ primer (5′-ACCCAAGCTTCGCCCT-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-ATCGTCGACGGGAGAG-3′), and placed upstream of the pRVBCAT plasmid as p3ERE-RVBCAT. p3ERE-RVBCAT then underwent internal restriction enzyme digestion with Sph I and Sal I followed by religation to establish a p2ERE-RVBCAT and p1ERE-RVBCAT which contained 2 or 1 ERE repeats, respectively. A heterologous SV40-driven CAT reporter system was also utilized to verify the ERE function. Synthesized oligonucleotides of the ERE as 5′-pGATCTAAGCTTGGGAGAGGAGCTGGAGAGAGGGCGATATCA-3′ and 5′-p-GATCTGATATCGCCCTCTCTCCAGCTCCTCTCCCAAGCTTA-3′ were annealed and ligated into a Bgl II site in a pPromoterCAT vector (Promega) to obtain both a sense oriented (pERE(s)SV40CAT) and antisense oriented (pERE(as)SV40CAT) CAT construct. Two-base mutations of the ERE (from T to C) synthesized from oligonucleotides as 5′-CCCTCTCCCCAGCTCCCCTCCC-3′ and its compliment, were placed in front of an SV40 promoter of the pPromoterCAT vector at a Klenow-blunted Bgl II site to establish a heterologous ERE mutation construct (pERE(Mu)SV40CAT), after polymerase chain reaction screening and DNA sequencing confirmation. DNA transfection was performed on 1 × 107 of 80% confluent NR6-P and NR6-WT cells using equimolar amounts of pCAT constructs corresponding to 20 μg of pCAT-basic DNA (Promega) by an electroporation method (Bio-Rad) under constant conditions (400 V, 500 microfarads capacity, and 0 resistance). Plasmids containing a β-galactosidase gene driven by an SV40 promoter were used to normalize the transfection efficiency for basal levels of CAT expression. In the EGF induction CAT assays, transfected cells were equally divided, allowed to recover in complete medium for 24 h, and then treated with or without 10 nm EGF for an additional 24 h in 0.1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum containing medium. CAT activity was measured from cell extracts by the CAT Enzyme Assay System (Promega) based on liquid scintillation counting using14C-labeled chloramphenicol (Amersham) andn-butynyl coenzyme A. The level of CAT activity from pRVBCAT transfectants without EGF induction was set at 100% and the percent (fold) increase in the other transfectants determined and compared with the standard. Five independent experiments, each in duplicate, were performed for each plasmid transfection. Statistical significance was determined by use of the Student's t test. 5 × 107 cells were lysed, and nuclei collected as above, following 10 nmEGF induction of both NR6-P and NR6-WT cells for 0, 1, 3, 6, or 12 h. Disruption of the nuclear membranes was accomplished by sequentially adding 1/2 packed nuclear volume of a low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 60 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) and then an equal volume of a (1/2 packed nuclear volume) high salt buffer (1.2 m KCl as 60 mm in low salt buffer). The solution was gently mixed for 30 min before centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 30 min. Supernatants were tube dialyzed (6,000–8,000 Mr cut-off) against a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 2 h followed by centrifugation to remove precipitated protein and nucleic acids. Supernatants containing nuclear extracts were further purified by heparin-affinity chromatography (Bio-Rad) and eluted from a concentration gradient of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5 m KCl in TM buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol). Aliquots that contained the most significant binding to the DNA probe were stored at −70 °C and utilized in the subsequent gel shift and DNA footprinting assays. The final concentration of extracts was estimated by both a Bio-Rad protein assay and quantitative gel shift assay. Hin dIII-digested pSacBCAT plasmid was Klenow end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP before a second digestion with Eco RV. The released 120-bp labeled DNA fragment was fractionated and purified on agarose gel. Complementary synthetic oligonucleotides of putative ERE sequence (Fig. 6) were annealed before T4 kinase 5′-end-labeling with [γ-32P]ATP. 2 × 104 cpm of each probe was applied to 20 μl of premixed gel shift reaction containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 40 ng of poly(dI·dC) in the presence of 4 μg of nuclear extract at 25 °C for 1 h. Poly(dI·dC) at 0.2 or 1 μg, unlabeled 120-bp DNA probe at 1 or 100 ng, and unlabeled pRVBCAT insert DNA at 1 or 100 ng were preincubated with the nuclear extracts at 25 °C for 10 min before being placed in reaction with the labeled probe which served as the competition control. Annealed synthetic oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with γ-32P by T4 kinase before being used in gel shift reactions. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native 4% nondenatured polyacrylamide gel containing 45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, and 2.5% glycerol under nondenaturing conditions. After exposure to x-ray film, gel shift bands were quantified by densitometry (Image 1.47 software). DNase I protection assays were performed in 50 μl of reaction with 0.5, 2, or 4 μg of nuclear extract from NR6-WT cells treated with or without 10 nm EGF for 6 h and 2 × 104 cpm of the 120-bp [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probe as described in the gel shift assay. The nuclear extract was preincubated without probe for 10 min on ice in the same buffer as used in the gel shift assay, and incubated for another 30 min on ice after the addition of probe. Digestion was initiated with the addition of 1 unit of DNase I (Promega) in 25 mm CaCl2 at room temperature and terminated after 1 min with 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA) prior to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Digested DNA and sequencing reactions of the probe using sequencing primer, 5′-AGCTTCTCCCTCTTTCCAC-3′ carried out by the Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), was resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel followed by autoradiography. Our previous data indicated that EGF up-regulated cell attachment of NR6 mouse fibroblastic cells to hyaluronic acid by increasing the expression of the cell surface adhesion molecule CD44 at both the protein and mRNA levels (16Zhang M. Singh R.K. Wang M.H. Wells A. Siegal G.P. Clin. & Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 268-276PubMed Google Scholar). EGF treatment of NR6 cells expressing wild-type EGFR resulted in a 3–4-fold up-regulation of CD44 protein expression with a maximum at 24 h, as well as a 3-fold increase of mRNA levels after 6–24 h of EGF treatment (16Zhang M. Singh R.K. Wang M.H. Wells A. Siegal G.P. Clin. & Exp. Metastasis. 1996; 14: 268-276PubMed Google Scholar). The CD44 mRNA in NR6 cells were determined by nuclear run-on analysis to confirm the transcriptional regulatory mechanism (Fig. 1). Both NR6 parental cells without endogenous EGFR (−P) and NR6 cells with transfected EGFR (−WT) were preincubated with 10 nm EGF for various times before collecting and labeling new transcripts. In agreement with earlier Northern blot analysis, there was no perceptible change in the rate of CD44 transcription with NR6-P cells, while a 3-fold induction was observed maximally at 6 h in NR6-WT cells in the presence of EGF. This was seen to decline by a third at 12 h, identical to the transient wave of mRNA seen on Northern blot analysis (data not shown). These results support the contention that EGF regulates CD44 mRNA levels by increasing transcription in a time-dependent manner at least during short-term EGF exposure. To identify the sequence that mediates EGF responsiveness in the CD44 gene, a series of DNA fragments containing the sequence of the human CD44 gene upstream regulatory region (pRBCAT) and restriction enzymatic internal truncations (pSacBCAT and pRVBCAT) and deletions of the human CD44 gene upstream region (pRB-SRCAT) were obtained and placed into a bacterial CAT reporter gene (Fig.2 A). CAT activities were measured on electroporated transfected NR6-WT cells in the presence or absence of EGF. Consistent with the previous finding in human neuroblastoma cells (26Treisman R. Cell. 1986; 46: 567-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), all constructs that contained the 150-bp sequence upstream of the transcription initiation site conferred substantial basal CAT activity on the constructs (Fig. 2 B) when compared with the promoterless CAT plasmid. The observation that not only did pSacBCAT elicit a 2-fold higher basal CAT activity than pRVBCAT or pRB-SRCAT, both of which were lacking a 120-bp fragment between Sac I and Eco RV sites (Sac-RV fragment), but that the same order of magnitude change was seen in comparison to pRBCAT, which contains this fragment, suggested that a negative cis-element upstream of the Sac I site and a stimulatory cis-element on the Sac-RV fragment may contribute to the basal promoter activity. Moreover, as there was an increase in EGF-mediated induction of CAT activity in pRBCAT and pSacBCAT (2.5- and 2.3-fold, respectively) (Fig. 2 C), the only construct with a Sac-RV fragment sequence, this was strong presumptive evidence that an ERE was present in this region. To test whether the observed relatively low EGF induction in NR6 cells (2.3-fold) was due to low promoter activity or is the result of a cell-specific effect, three transformed human cell lines, which express EGFR and CD44 and are derived from prostate, DU145-WT, breast, MCF-7, or cervix HeLa, were employed in our transfection/CAT system (Fig. 3). All cells were transfected by pCAT, pRVBCAT, and pSacBCAT constructs via standard electroporation methods. Basal level of CAT activity was determined by cotransfection of β-galactosidase and was shown to be similar among these cells (data not shown). After EGF stimulation for 24 h following transfection, changes in CAT activity was determined by comparing EGF-treated cells with their non-EGF-treated counterparts. In agreement with the data from NR6 cells, no significant CAT induction was found following mock (pCAT basic vector) and pRVBCAT transfections in all cell lines tested; however, a differentiated CAT induction by EGF stimulation was demonstrated in these cells, being 2.3-, 3.3-, 1.8-, and 1.2-fold in NR6-WT, DU145-WT, MCF-7, and HeLa cells, respectively. The extent of chloramphenicol acetylation did not increase in the presence of a 4-fold excess of n-butynyl coenzyme A; thus, this substrate was not limiting under the conditions of the assay. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrated that CAT induction of NR6-WT cells began at a low dose of 5 nm EGF and was sustained at an EGF concentration of up to 20 nm(data not shown), indicating no EGF dose-dependent bidirectional effect. The presence of an EGF inducible DNA binding activity was sought by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using the 32P-labeled Sac-RV DNA fragment (which contained the putative ERE described in the functional analysis), and nuclear extracts from NR6-P and -WT cells. Pilot experiments indicated that nuclear extracts eluted from heparin-affinity columns with 0.4m KCl buffer contained the DNA-protein complexes of interest. Binding specificity was assessed by examining the effect of excess amounts of poly(dI·dC) as nonspecific DNA, unlabeled Sac-RV fragment as specific competitor, and probe containing the CD44 promoter sequence from the pRVBCAT plasmid as random nonspecific DNA (Fig.4). It was noted that three bands (labeled 2, 3, and 4) were eliminated by preincubating the labeled probe with 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC), while the major band (labeled1) retained significant binding, even in the presence of excess poly(dI·dC) (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the major band could be competed only with increasing amounts of specific unlabeled Sac-RV probe (10–100 ng, equivalent to 20–200-fold excess of the labeled probe) (Fig. 4 B) but not to excessive nonspecific probe derived from pRVBCAT (Fig. 4 C). The time course of EGF induction of this ERE response was assessed using nuclear extracts from both NR6-P and -WT cells, treated by EGF for 1, 3, 6, or 12 h (Fig. 5). Extracts were normalized to cell number with the loading amount ranging from 3.8 to 4.0 μg; 0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC) (500-fold excess) was also included in the reaction mixture to minimize nonspecific binding. No change was observed in protein-DNA complex formation upon EGF stimulation in the NR6-P cells. However, in NR6-WT cells, the induction became evident (2-fold increase, n = 3), 3–6 h after exposure to EGF, and persisted for at least 12 h (Fig. 5 B). It was noted also that this time-dependent induction of protein-DNA complex formation paralleled the mRNA wave demonstrated in both Northern blot and nuclear run-on assays, suggesting that the induction response required functional EGFR expressed on cell surfaces and that the Sac-RV fragment contained an ERE. This work strengthened the hypothesis that EGF up-regulates CD44 gene expression through induction of transcriptional factor(s) binding to an ERE in the gene promoter region.

https://openalex.org/W1965611953,"We previously characterized a mutant apoB allele (the apoB86 allele) that produces both a truncated apoB (apoB86) and a full-length apoB100. The mutant allele contained a deletion of a single cytosine in exon 26, creating a stretch of eight consecutive adenines in the −1 reading frame. The altered reading-frame allele was restored, with ∼10% efficiency, by the transcriptional insertion of an extra adenine into the stretch of eight consecutive adenines, thereby accounting for the synthesis of the full-length apoB100. Here, we demonstrate that this reading-frame restoration does not occur when the long stretch of adenines is interrupted by a cytosine. To assess whether reading-frame restoration is unique to a single site in the apoB gene, the same mutation (eight consecutive adenines in the −1 reading frame) was inserted into another site within the apoB gene. Reading-frame restoration occurred at the second site and was abrogated when the stretch of adenines was interrupted by another base. Of note, a computerized analysis of human cDNA sequences revealed that long stretches of adenines in protein-coding sequences occur at a lower than predicted frequency, suggesting that evolution has selected against these sequences.

Of note, a computerized analysis of human cDNA sequences revealed that long stretches of adenines in protein-coding sequences occur at a lower than predicted frequency, suggesting that evolution has selected against these sequences. In 1992, we reported the existence of a mutant apoB allele causing familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, the apoB86 allele (1Linton M.F. Pierotti V. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11431-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This allele, which resulted in the synthesis of both a truncated apoB (apoB86) and a full-length apoB100, contained a deletion of a single cytosine residue in exon 26 of the apoB gene. This frameshift mutation was predicted to yield a stretch of 20 novel amino acids, followed by a premature stop codon. That this mutation was responsible for the production of apoB86 was proved by immunochemical studies utilizing monoclonal antibodies and an anti-peptide antibody directed against the 20 novel amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of apoB86 (1Linton M.F. Pierotti V. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11431-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The production of apoB100 from this allele involved a novel mechanism: reading-frame restoration by transcriptional insertion of an extra nucleotide at the site of the 1-base pair (bp) 1The abbreviation used is:bpbase pair(s) deletion. The deletion of the single cytosine residue in the apoB86 allele created a stretch of eight consecutive adenine residues. Minigene expression studies in cultured hepatoma cells demonstrated that the single cytosine deletion, along with the stretch of eight consecutive adenines, was faithfully present in the genomic DNA, but that ∼10% of apoB86 cDNA clones actually contained nine consecutive adenines (1Linton M.F. Pierotti V. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11431-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the production of apoB100 by the apoB86 allele was due to the transcriptional insertion of an extra adenine, which restored the proper reading frame to the mutant mRNA. These studies provided the first in vivo evidence of “transcriptional slippage” (or “stuttering”) along a long stretch of consecutive adenines in mammalian cells. base pair(s) Slippage of RNA polymerase during transcription was first proposed by Chamberlin and Berg in 1962 (2Chamberlin M. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In recent years, Wagner et al. (3Wagner L.A. Weiss R.B. Driscoll R. Dunn D.S. Gesteland R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3529-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) described transcriptional slippage by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase during RNA elongation at runs of 10 or more adenines or thymines, resulting in the addition of untemplated thymine or adenine residues and restoration of the proper reading frame to out-of-frame lacZ constructs. Interestingly, RNA polymerase stuttering was not observed when similar experiments were performed in yeast (3Wagner L.A. Weiss R.B. Driscoll R. Dunn D.S. Gesteland R.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3529-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This study was undertaken to define further the DNA sequence requirements for reading-frame restoration in the apoB86 allele. We also sought to determine whether the reading-frame restoration was somehow unique to the apoB86 allele or would occur at similar sequences elsewhere in the apoB gene. Finally, because transcriptional slippage could potentially introduce frameshift mutations, we hypothesized that evolution may have selected against the presence of long stretches of adenines in protein-coding sequences. To assess this possibility, we analyzed whether long stretches of adenines occur at a lower than predicted frequency in human proteins containing three consecutive lysine residues.

Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The apoB86 allele contains a single cytosine deletion (cDNA nucleotide 11840) in exon 26 of the apoB gene, which generates a stretch of eight consecutive adenines in the −1 reading frame (i.e. the mutation changes the sequence AAA AAC AAA to AAA AAA AA). An apoB fusion minigene vector (pB18/86) containing the 1-bp deletion found in the apoB86 allele and a wild-type vector lacking the mutation (pB18/100) have been described (1Linton M.F. Pierotti V. Young S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11431-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For this study, we mutated the pB18/100 expression vector to delete one of the adenines immediately preceding cytosine 11840 instead of cytosine 11840 itself. This construct contained the sequence AAA ACA AA and was designated pB18/86:4AC3A (because it had four adenines, one cytosine, and then three more adenines) (Fig. 1). Thus, pB18/86:4AC3A contained the same −1 frameshift as the apoB86 allele, but lacked the long stretch of adenines. To create pB18/86:4AC3A, we used the mutagenesis technique of Deng and Nickoloff (10Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) and a mutagenic primer (5′-GCCAGTTTGAAAACAAAGCAGAT-3′). In addition, we generated pB18/86cDNA (Fig. 1), which is identical to pB18/86, except that it was constructed entirely from cDNA clones. For this clone, a 2119-bp Bam HI-Hin dIII cDNA fragment was ligated to the pB18 cDNA vector, rather than to the 3567-bpBam HI-Hin dIII genomic fragment. The apoB86 mutation was introduced into the vector by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing."

We previously observed that inflamed ductule and acinar epithelia in the prostate also overexpress matrilysin. The presence of infiltrating macrophages in these areas prompted us to determine if factors secreted from monocytes could induce matrilysin expression in a human prostatic cell line. Conditioned media collected from the monocyte cell line THP-1 following lipopolysaccharide treatment substantially induced matrilysin protein and mRNA expression in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells.

The matrix metalloproteases are a family of enzymes that degrade extracellular matrix proteins.

A unique feature of matrilysin expression is that it appears to predominate in epithelial cells of glandular tissue, while other matrix metalloproteases, such as stromelysin and the gelatinases, are more commonly expressed by cells in the stromal compartment (1Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The expression of matrilysin during normal and pathological events that involve matrix remodeling and the cell type specificity of this expression imply an important role for matrilysin in these events. In the normal prostate, we have observed that inflamed ductule and acinar epithelia frequently express high levels of matrilysin (11Pajouh M.S. Nagle R.B. Breathnach R. Finch J.S. Brawer M.K.

Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the expression of matrilysin mRNA in the prostate epithelium correlates with the expression of matrilysin protein. We have speculated that the high levels of matrilysin expression in inflamed prostate epithelial cells might be due to the presence of infiltrating macrophages within these structures.

While the induction of matrilysin and other matrix metalloproteases by inflammatory cytokines has been observed in cultured glomerular mesangial cells (25Marti H.P. McNeil L. Thomas G. Davies M. Lovett D.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and some glioma cell lines (26Nakano A. Tani E. Miyazaki K. Yamamoto Y. Furuyama J. J. Neurosurg. 1995; 83: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), there have been no reports on the effect of inflammatory cytokines on matrilysin expression in cells of glandular epithelial origin. tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin THP-1 conditioned medium lipopolysaccharide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid human matrilysin promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase The purpose of the work reported here was to determine if factors secreted from monocytic cells could induce matrilysin expression in a prostatic cell line and, if so, by what mechanism. We report that IL-1β secreted from monocytic cells induces matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells and that the mechanism of this induction involves an increase in matrilysin gene transcription. LNCaP and THP-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin (100 units/ml)/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For all experiments, LNCaP cells were seeded in full medium and allowed to attach for 20–24 h prior to treatment. To generate THP-1 conditioned medium (THP-1 CM), THP-1 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were incubated for 4 h in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 5 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma) and then clarified by centrifugation and passed through a 0.2-μm filter. Recombinant human IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and neutralizing antibodies against the IL-1 proteins were purchased from Genzyme Diagnostics (Cambridge, MA); recombinant TNF-α was from Boehringer Mannheim; and antibody against mouse IL-2 was from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). An antibody sandwich assay was developed for detection and quantification of matrilysin. The capture antibody (10D2, a mouse monoclonal antibody produced in the laboratory of Dr. Raymond Nagle using purified promatrilysin from Dr. Mark Navre, Syntex, Palo Alto, CA) was coated onto 96-well EIA plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). This antibody is specific for human promatrilysin, and therefore, the ELISA does not detect active matrilysin. The detection antibodies included antibody Rb2, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to human matrilysin (12Knox J.D. Wolf C. McDaniel K. Clark V. Loriot M. Bowden G.T. Nagle R.B. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Pierce) used to detect bound Rb2. Horseradish peroxidase activity was quantitated using a hydrogen peroxide/o-phenyldiamine (Sigma) colorimetric system. Purified promatrilysin was used to generate a standard curve for each assay. No cross-reactivity was observed with either purified gelatinase A or gelatinase B (a gift from Dr. Eric Howard, University of Oklahoma). The assay was linear in the range of 0.2–12.5 ng/ml. Samples were diluted prior to analysis until the readings fell within the linear range of the assay, and the results were multiplied by the dilution factor. Total RNA was isolated from cells by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (27Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA (20 μg) were electrophoresed on a MOPS/formaldehyde-agarose (1%) gel. The RNA was transblotted onto a nylon membrane (GeneScreen™, DuPont NEN) and cross-linked with ultraviolet light (GS Genelinker™, Bio-Rad). The membranes were then hybridized with a 32P-labeled random-primed probe generated from a full-length matrilysin cDNA (28Quantin B. Murphy G. Breathnach R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5327-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) using the RTS RadPrime DNA labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were then exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager equipped with the ImageQuant software package was used for obtaining and analyzing digital images from the screens. As a control for loading and transfer of RNA, all membranes were stripped and reprobed for glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase as described above with a probe generated from an 800-base pair Xba I-Pst I fragment from pHcGAP (American Type Culture Collection). Detection of matrilysin protein in media by Western analysis was done as described previously (29Borchers A.H. Powell M.B. Fusenig N.E. Bowden G.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Rb2 was used as the primary antibody, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as the secondary antibody. Bands were visualized by treating the membranes with Western blotting ECL detection reagent (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) and exposing them to Kodak autoradiographic film. To generate the heterologous human matrilysin promoter (HMP) construct used in these studies, 1170 base pairs of the HMP located directly upstream of the TATA box were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pBLCAT2 (30Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of the HMP (kindly provided by Dr. Lynn Matrisian, Vanderbilt University) was carried out using the following heterologous primers, which contained eitherHin dIII (upstream primer) or Xba I (downstream primer) restriction site sequences linked to matrilysin promoter-specific sequences (matrilysin-specific regions of each primer are underlined): upstream sense primer, 5′-CCCAAGCTTAGCTCCAGCATATTT-3′; and downstream antisense primer, 5′-TGCTCTAGAGCTTCTCAGCCTCG-3′. The resultant 1217-base pair amplification product was digested withHin dIII/Xba I, gel-purified, and directionally cloned into Hin dIII/Xba I-digested pBLCAT2 immediately upstream of the thymidine kinase minimal promoter. The resulting plasmid, named pHMPCAT, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. LNCaP cells, grown in 12.5-cm flasks, were transfected (10 μg of plasmid/flask) using Lipofectin (5 μl/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids were isolated using QiaPrep columns (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, the cells were washed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and then incubated in treatment medium. Cell lysates were collected and analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) enzyme activity as described previously (31Domann Jr., F.E. Levy J.P. Birrer M.J. Bowden G.T. Cell Growth & Differ. 1994; 5: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar). The cell lysate added to each CAT enzyme assay was normalized for equal protein as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. The percent butylation of [14C]chloramphenicol by cell lysates was determined by TLC, followed by exposure of the TLC plates to a storage phosphor screen and analysis of the digital images obtained as described above for Northern analyses. The monocyte cell line THP-1 (32Tsuchiya S. Yamabe M. Yamaguchi Y. Kobayashi Y. Konno T. Tada K. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar) was used as a source of monocyte-derived factors to test the hypothesis that these factors induce matrilysin expression in prostate epithelial cells. The human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP was used because these cells express matrilysin protein in cell culture and have retained some features of normal prostate epithelial cells including androgen responsiveness and secretion of prostate-specific antigen. LNCaP cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium alone, in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium treated with LPS, or in THP-1 CM. After a 48-h incubation, the amount of matrilysin protein secreted into the medium was determined. Western analysis for matrilysin protein revealed that THP-1 CM dramatically induced the expression of matrilysin protein by LNCaP cells (Fig. 1 A). Nearly all of the matrilysin protein present was in the 28-kDa proenzyme form, with only a slight band corresponding to the 19-kDa activated form (lane D). THP-1 cells did not secrete any matrilysin protein in response to LPS activation (lane B), and LPS alone did not induce matrilysin protein expression in LNCaP cells (lane C). An ELISA was used to better quantitate and follow the induction of LNCaP matrilysin protein expression by THP-1 cell-secreted factors. Quantitation of promatrilysin by ELISA demonstrated an ∼70-fold increase in secreted matrilysin protein in media from LNCaP cells treated with THP-1 CM compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1 B). Monocytic cells are known to secrete the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 in response to activation by LPS. To determine if one of these cytokines might be responsible for THP-1 CM induction of matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells, we treated LNCaP cells with equimolar amounts of purified recombinant forms of these cytokines. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment with IL-1 (50 pm) induced an ∼100-fold increase in promatrilysin expression by LNCaP cells compared with untreated cells, while neither TNF-α nor IL-6 was capable of inducing a significant change in matrilysin expression. These data strongly implicate IL-1 as being a factor in THP-1 CM that is at least partially responsible for the induction of matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells. Two forms of IL-1 receptor agonists are known, IL-1α and IL-1β. Neutralizing antibodies specific for IL-1α or IL-1β were therefore used to determine if either of these proteins was responsible for THP-1 CM induction of matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig.3, preincubation of THP-1 CM with anti-IL-1β antibody prior to incubation with LNCaP cells completely abrogated the ability of THP-1 CM to induce matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells, while preincubation with anti-IL-1α antibody had no effect. The neutralization observed with anti-IL-1β antibody was specific as preincubation with anti-IL-1α or a monoclonal antibody to mouse IL-2 did not alter the ability of THP-1 CM to induce LNCaP matrilysin expression. Anti-IL-1α antibody was able to neutralize the induction of LNCaP matrilysin expression by a 50 pm dose of recombinant IL-1α, demonstrating that the antibody was active (data not shown). The effect of THP-1 CM on steady-state matrilysin mRNA levels in LNCaP cells was also studied. LNCaP cells were treated for 20 h with THP-1 CM with or without antibody preincubation. At the end of the treatment period, total RNA was collected from LNCaP cells and analyzed by Northern hybridization. Treatment with THP-1 CM resulted in a substantial increase in steady-state matrilysin mRNA (Fig.4 A, lane B) over that observed in untreated control cells (lane A). Quantitation by digital image analysis revealed that, following glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate dehydrogenase correction for loading and transfer, this increase was ∼50-fold over untreated LNCaP cells (Fig. 4 B, column 1). Preincubation of THP-1 CM with IL-1β neutralizing antibody completely blocked its capacity to induce steady-state matrilysin mRNA levels (lane C and column 2), while the irrelevant antibody against mouse IL-2 had no effect (lane D and column 3). To determine if transcriptional activation of the matrilysin gene promoter could be involved in the IL-1β-induced increase of steady-state matrilysin mRNA, we conducted transient transfection experiments in LNCaP cells with a human matrilysin promoter-TK-CAT reporter construct (pHMPCAT). Treatment of pHMPCAT-transfected cells with 200 pm IL-1β for 48 h resulted in a 3.7-fold increase in CAT enzyme activity compared with untreated cells (Fig.5), whereas no induction was seen in cells transfected with the parental vector (pBLCAT2). We have demonstrated that IL-1β secreted from the THP-1 monocyte cell line induces expression of the matrix metalloprotease matrilysin by the prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP. This is the first time to our knowledge that IL-1 has been demonstrated to induce matrilysin in an epithelial cell line. THP-1 cells are induced to secrete inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 by treatment with LPS (33Fruehauf J.P. Sinha B.K. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 91-101PubMed Google Scholar). Although LNCaP cells have been reported to express receptors for all three of these cytokines (34Boutten A. Dehoux M. Deschenes M. Rouzeau J.D. Bories P.N. Durand G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2687-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Hsieh T.C. Chiao J.W. Cancer Lett. 1995; 95: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 36Siegsmund M.J. Yamazaki H. Pastan I. J. Urol. 1994; 151: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and TNF-α has been shown to be an important regulator of matrix metalloprotease expression in non-epithelial cells (37Jasser M.Z. Mitchell P.G. Cheung H.S. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38MacNaul K.L. Chartrain N. Lark M. Tocci M.J. Hutchinson N.I.

Commun. 1993; 196: 1133-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), only IL-1 induced matrilysin protein expression in LNCaP cells. Both IL-1α and IL-1β induced matrilysin expression in LNCaP cells; however, IL-1α antibody treatment did not affect matrilysin induction by THP-1 CM. We can therefore conclude that THP-1 cells secrete little or no IL-1α, which is in agreement with published observations of IL-1 expression by these cells (40Turner M. Chantry D. Feldmann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 156: 830-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unlike IL-1β, IL-1α exists primarily as an intracellular and membrane-bound protein and is not normally secreted (41Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes have been reported to express matrilysin in vitro(5Busiek D.F. Ross F.P. McDonnell S. Murphy G. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9087-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this expression is reportedly enhanced by LPS treatment. Therefore, one might expect that the THP-1 cells would express matrilysin. However, we observed no matrilysin expression by THP-1 cells even after LPS treatment. The expression of matrilysin by monocytes has been determined to be developmentally regulated as fully differentiated macrophages do not express matrilysin (5Busiek D.F. Ross F.P. McDonnell S. Murphy G. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9087-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible then that THP-1 cells, which are a leukemic cell line of unknown passage number, have not retained the ability to express matrilysin. The increase of steady-state matrilysin mRNA in LNCaP cells induced by THP-1 cell-secreted IL-1β was comparable to that observed for matrilysin protein induction, suggesting that regulation of the matrilysin mRNA level is the major mechanism by which IL-1β treatment increased matrilysin protein expression by LNCaP cells. This result is in agreement with reports that IL-1β is a transcriptional regulator of other matrix metalloprotease genes including stromelysin-1 (16McCachren S.S. Greer P.K. Niedel J.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Quinones S. Saus J. Otani Y. Harris Jr., E.D. Kurkinen M. J. Biol.

Transient transfection experiments with the reporter plasmid pHMPCAT in LNCaP cells revealed a significant IL-1β-induced increase in CAT transcription, although the magnitude of this increase does not account for the total increase in steady-state matrilysin mRNA observed in IL-1β-treated LNCaP cells. This could be due to problems inherent to transient transfection analysis, or the matrilysin gene may contain additional IL-1β response elements not present in pHMPCAT. The known enhancer elements in the portion of the matrilysin promoter present in pHMPCAT include an AP-1-binding site, two PEA-3 elements, and a number of NF-IL-6 consensus sequences (T(T/G)NNGNAA(T/G)) (1Wilson C.L. Matrisian L.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 123-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). There are also three putative transforming growth factor-β inhibitory elements. We are now performing deletion analysis of the human matrilysin promoter in pHMPCAT to determine the regions responsible for IL-1β transcriptional regulation in LNCaP cells. IL-1β may also have additional effects on matrilysin mRNA stability in LNCaP cells, and we are conducting experiments to address this possibility. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors could be necessary to permit a similar matrilysin induction in prostate epithelial cells in vivo, our finding that IL-1β induces the expression of matrilysin in a prostatic cell line offers a potential explanation for the matrilysin overexpression observed in inflamed dilated ducts and atrophic glands of the normal prostate. Saarialho-Kere et al. (44Saarialho-Kere U.K. Crouch E.C. Parks W.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 190-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that normal prostate glands constitutively express matrilysin; however, this basal expression must be very low as we have not observed strong matrilysin expression in normal, non-inflamed prostate glands and ducts (11Pajouh M.S. Nagle R.B. Breathnach R. Finch J.S. Brawer M.K. Bowden G.T. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1991; 117: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 12Knox J.D. Wolf C. McDaniel K. Clark V. Loriot M. Bowden G.T. Nagle R.B. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We propose that infiltrating macrophages present near inflamed ducts and glands secrete IL-1β, which induces transcription of the matrilysin gene in ductule and glandular epithelial cells. This hypothesis is supported by results from a limited number of experiments with normal human prostate epithelial cells. These cells secrete very low levels of promatrilysin protein in vitro, and treatment with THP-1 CM or IL-1β (50 pm) results in a 2–3-fold increase in promatrilysin protein expression (data not shown). The pathological significance of dilated ducts and atrophic glands in the human prostate is not known; however, it is likely that a substantial amount of extracellular matrix remodeling occurs at these sites. The presence of macrophage infiltration near areas of epithelial matrilysin expression is not limited to the prostate. For example, the number of macrophages present in endometrial tissue increases substantially in the late secretory/premenstrual endometrium (45Kamat B.R. Isaacson P.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1987; 127: 66-73PubMed Google Scholar), correlating with a reported increase in matrilysin expression in the late secretory and menstrual endometrial epithelium (2Rodgers W.H. Osteen K.G. Matrisian L.M. Navre M. Giudice L.C. Gorstein F. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1993; 168: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). During inflammation, macrophages secrete a number of matrix-degrading enzymes and are capable of inducing stromal fibroblasts to express matrix metalloproteases. IL-1β induction of matrilysin expression by epithelial cells may be another important component of inflammation-associated tissue remodeling in the prostate as well as in other glandular epithelial tissues.

These observations have raised the question as to whether some of the cellular effects of BFA might be mediated by mono-ADP-ribosylation. brefeldin A glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase endoplasmic reticulum ADP-ribosylation factor fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) ADP-ribosylation inhibitor The cellular actions of BFA are multiple and complex. BFA selectively blocks constitutive protein secretion and causes a rapid and extensive disruption of the Golgi apparatus consisting of the transformation of the Golgi stacks into a tubular reticular network followed by the redistribution of most of the Golgi resident proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (17Lippincott-Schwartz J.

BFA also profoundly affects the morphology and function of the endocytic system (21Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J.

Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Some of these effects are most probably due to an already well documented effect of the toxin, namely the release of a set of proteins (25Robinson M.S. Kreis T.E.

It is far from clear, however, that all of the functional and structural effects of BFA are due to the inactivation of the above coat proteins. Moreover, there is evidence, albeit indirect, that suggests that also the ADP-ribosylation reaction may play a role in the cellular effects of BFA. First, BFA activates ADP-ribosylation both in intact and Triton-solubilized Golgi membranes through a site exhibiting a ligand selectivity identical to that involved in the BFA effects on the Golgi structure (9Di Girolamo M. Silletta M.G. De Matteis M.A. Braca A. Colanzi A. Pawlak D. Rasenik M.M. Luini A. Corda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This suggests that the same (or very similar) BFA-binding components may be involved in the two BFA-induced events. Second, nonspecific inhibitors of mono-ADP-ribosylation such as nicotinamide (33Rankin P.W. Jacobson E.L. Benjamin R.C. Moss J. Jacobson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4312-4317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Banasik M. Komura H. Shimoyama M. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can reduce the effects of the toxin on the morphology of the Golgi complex (35Mironov A. Sciulli M.G. Flati S. Colanzi A. Santini G. Fusella A. Mironov Jr., A. Corda D. De Matteis M.A. Luini A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. Suppl. 1995; 5: 155Google Scholar). It is therefore of interest to develop a set of specific inhibitors of BFA-induced mono-ADP-ribosylation as they would greatly help to define the cellular role of this reaction. Here, we report the characterization and development of a series of chemical inhibitors of the BFA-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation reaction. They belong to two chemical classes, containing either a coumarin (dicumarol, coumermycin A1, and novobiocin) or a quinone (ilimaquinones and analogs) group. These drugs, when tested in vivo at concentrations similar to those effective in vitro mono-ADP-ribosylation assays, antagonized the ability of BFA to induce the disassembly of the Golgi complex. BFA, NAD+, nucleotides,dl-dithiothreitol, and fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Helix pomatia lectin were from Sigma. Coenzymes Q2, Q4, and Q6 were from Fluka. All the other inhibitors, unless otherwise specified, were from Sigma. BFA analogs were prepared by Dr. A. Greene (J. Fourier University, Grenoble, France) as described previously (36Corey E.J. Wollenberg R.H. Tetrahedron Lett. 1976; 51: 4701-4704Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 37Le Drian C. Green A.E. J. Am. Chem.

Shimizu (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). [32P]NAD+ was from DuPont NEN or Amersham Corp. Rabbit skeletal muscle GAPDH was from Calbiochem or Sigma. The monoclonal antibody against ARF (1D9) was a gift of Dr. R. Kahn (Emory School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). The35S-labeled rabbit antibody against mouse IgG was from Amersham Corp. Polyclonal antibodies against the calcium-binding protein (CaBP1) and calreticulin were gifts of Dr. J. Füllekrug (University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany). The polyclonal antibody against mannosidase II was a gift of Dr. K. Moremen (University of Georgia, Athens, GA). Monoclonal antibodies against Rab5 and Rab7 were gifts from Dr. M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany); the monoclonal antibody against TGN38 was donated by Dr. G. Banting (School of Medical Science, Bristol, United Kingdom). FITC- and tetramethylrhodamine 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Sigma or Cappel. The materials for cell culture, including plasticware, chamber slides (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark), and medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), were purchased from Mascia Brunelli S. p. A. (Milano, Italy). Rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 16% fetal calf serum and 1 mm l-glutamine as described (38De Matteis M.A. Di Tullio G. Buccione R. Luini A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10452-10460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Harlan Sprague Dawley male rats (150–250 g) were killed by decapitation. Tissues were immediately removed and placed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 4 mmHEPES, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3), washed four to five times with the same buffer, minced with scissors, and homogenized in a Teflon-glass Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (15–20 strokes). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min, and the post-nuclear supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 90 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet (suspended in 3 m KCl and incubated for 30 min with stirring) was centrifuged at 12,700 × g in a microcentrifuge. The pellet obtained, termed “total membranes,” was washed and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4; aliquoted; frozen in liquid nitrogen; and then stored at −80 °C until needed. The reproducibility of these preparations was satisfactory. Each experiment was performed with at least two preparations, with similar results. Rat brain cytosol was prepared as described (39Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Sheperd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions were prepared as described (39Malhotra V. Serafini T. Orci L. Sheperd J.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 58: 329-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 40Borgese N. Meldolesi J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 501-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In some experiments, mitochondria were further purified as described by Rusinol et al. (41Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To check the composition of each fraction (post-nuclear supernatant, rough ER, smooth ER, Golgi membranes, mitochondria, and cytosol), equal amounts of protein (80 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with polyclonal antibodies against specific markers of intracellular organelles by Western blotting. The purity of the mitochondrial fraction was also tested by electron microscopy. Mitochondria were pelleted and processed as described previously (42Buccione R. Bannykh S. Santone I. Baldassarre M. Facchiano F. Bozzi Y. Di Tullio G. Mironov A. Luini A. De Matteis M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3523-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and then photographed with a Zeiss 109 transmission electron microscope. They were >90% pure. Unless otherwise specified, 10 μg of total membranes and 50 μg of cytosol, both from rat brain (or alternatively, 50 μg of post-nuclear supernatant), were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 30 μg/ml BFA in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 30 μm NAD+, 0.01 μCi/μl [32P]NAD+, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 10 mm thymidine in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet by electroblotting, and the radiolabeled proteins were quantified by autoradiography or by an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard). A rapid filtration assay was set up to measure the labeling of purified commercial GAPDH (8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S.

Unless otherwise specified, 10 μg of GAPDH were incubated with 10 μg of total membranes from rat brain as described above for the ADP-ribosylation assay. Samples were then pelleted at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of ice-cold 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm AMP, and 0.6 mm sodium pyrophosphate (final concentrations) and then filtered on a 96-well Bio-Rad dot-blot apparatus through a nitrocellulose sheet. Each well was filled with ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (200 μl/well) prior to the addition of the sample. GAPDH was allowed to adhere to the nitrocellulose by a gentle filtration and washed twice by filtering ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid (100 μl/well) and four times with low salt Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl). The nitrocellulose sheet was then boiled in distilled water for 10 min and stained with Ponceau S. Radiolabeled GAPDH was quantified by an Instant Imager. GAPDH was recovered quantitatively on the filters. This was established by processing in parallel a variety of identical samples by both the filter and SDS-PAGE-based assays (8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Di Girolamo M. Silletta M.G. De Matteis M.A. Braca A. Colanzi A. Pawlak D. Rasenik M.M. Luini A. Corda D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). None of the treatments described under “Results and Discussion” affected the amount of protein recovered on the filter. As previously reported (15Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9382-9385Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar,16McDonald L.J. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6238-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), GAPDH is nonenzymatically mono-ADP-ribosylated in the absence of BFA. Thus, for each condition tested in this study, control experiments using the BFA vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) were carried out to evaluate the basal nonenzymatic ADP-ribosylation of GAPDH. The pmol of ADP-ribosylated GAPDH reported in this study were calculated by subtracting the values of nonenzymatically ADP-ribosylated GAPDH from those obtained in the presence of BFA. Membranes (10 μg of protein) were incubated for 10 min with 100 μg of rat brain cytosol in a final volume of 100 μl containing 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7, 25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dl-dithiothreitol, and 40 μg/ml BFA where indicated; 10 μm GTPγS was then added, and incubation was continued for 5 min. The reaction was stopped by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellets were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (51Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against ARF (1D9) and a 35S-labeled rabbit antibody against mouse IgG. Radioactivity was quantified by an Instant Imager. Rat basophilic leukemia cells (grown on glass chamber slides) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min; quenched with 10 mm NH4Cl for 10 min; washed with PBS; and permeabilized with 0.05% saponin and 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with FITC-conjugated H. pomatia lectin (100 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 45 min or were incubated with primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed thoroughly with PBS, and incubated with specific FITC- or tetramethylrhodamine 5-isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After thorough washing, the slides were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and examined using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 100× objective. So far, work on BFA-stimulated mono-ADP-ribosylation has been carried out by labeling the cytosolic substrates with radioactive NAD+, separation by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography (8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

S. A. 1995; 92: 7065-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, to characterize the reaction in a quantitative fashion, we have developed a novel simplified assay based on the use of salt-washed membranes as the source of enzyme, pure commercial GAPDH as the substrate, a rapid filtration method to separate free from GAPDH-bound radioactivity, and counting of the radiolabeled GAPDH by an Instant Imager (see “Experimental Procedures”). This approach afforded a high sample output and reproducibility as well as the possibility to study modulatory effects of added cytosolic factors. Fig. 1 shows that BFA stimulated the reaction with an EC50 of 17 ± 3 μg/ml. The apparentKm of the reaction with respect to NAD+was 154 ± 13 μm (Fig. 1, inset). TheVmax was 510 ± 150 pmol/h/mg of membrane protein (at 30 μg/ml BFA). BFA regulated the reaction velocity by increasing the Vmax, whereas theKm was not detectably modified by varying the toxin concentration (Fig. 1, inset). Of note, the EC50of BFA was similar to that found by us in assays of ARF binding to Golgi membranes, but higher than the BFA EC50 in vitro. The difference between the in vivo and in vitro potencies of BFA has been noticed and discussed before by several authors (31Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 43Orci L. Tagaya M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Klausner R.D. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 64: 1183-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). A comparison of the results of the new assay (Fig. 1) with data obtained using the old method (where the cytosol was the source of substrate; see Ref. 8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) did not reveal evident differences, suggesting that cytosolic factors have no major effects on the reaction kinetics. The BFA-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of GAPDH was maximal near pH 7.6 at temperatures between 37 and 40 °C, with a second smaller peak at 30 °C, and was inhibited by higher than physiological levels of NaCl (Fig. 2). The double peak in the temperature profile is unusual. At present, we do not have a simple explanation for it. Of the major physiological divalent ions that were tested, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ were inactive, whereas Zn2+ and Cu2+ were inhibitory (with IC50 values of ∼75 and 500 μm, respectively). Several nucleotides (GTP, GDP, GTPγS, GDPβS, ATPγS, and cAMP and different combinations of these molecules) had no effect on GAPDH mono-ADP-ribosylation at concentrations up to 1 mm, whereas ATP was inhibitory (with an IC50 of ∼1 mm). Rat brain, liver, heart, spleen, lung, skeletal muscle, and kidney were tested for their content of enzymatic mono-ADP-ribosylating activity (using commercial GAPDH as a substrate) and of endogenous cytosolic substrates (GAPDH and BARS-50) (using rat brain membranes as the enzyme source). Fig. 3 A shows that the enzymatic activity was present in all tissues examined, with the highest levels in the brain and the lowest (nearly undetectable) in the kidney. It is unclear whether this reflects a real lack of expression of the enzyme in kidney tissue rather than, for instance, the presence of inhibitory factors or of degradative enzymes. The protein substrates were ubiquitous, with the highest levels in the brain, spleen, and heart (data not shown). Among the subcellular fractions, one fraction enriched in Golgi membranes and one containing the smooth ER as well as Golgi membranes were highly active; a lower but significant activity was found in mitochondria and the lowest in the rough ER (Fig. 3 B), whereas the cytosol was completely devoid of enzyme (data not shown). Since the ability of BFA to prevent the activation and binding of ARF to intracellular membranes is a well known in vitro activity of the toxin and is considered responsible for at least some of the cellular BFA effects, it was interesting to compare the subcellular distribution of this activity with the distribution of BFA-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation. Fig. 3 C shows that ARF binding was enriched in the Golgi membrane-containing subcellular fractions and was present (at lower levels) in the ER and mitochondria. This distribution profile was quite similar to that of BFA-dependent mono-ADP-ribosylation and is therefore compatible with the idea that the two activities of BFA (ARF binding and mono-ADP-ribosylation) might be associated (this point is discussed further below). The meaning of the presence of both activities in mitochondria is not clear at present. It is very unlikely to be due to contamination by Golgi or smooth ER membranes, as indicated by a comparison between their distribution with that of marker enzymes (CaBP1 for the endoplasmic reticulum, mannosidase II for Golgi membranes, and Rab5 for early endosomes; see Fig. 3 D). The binding of ARF to mitochondria and other subcellular fractions has been observed by others (44Cavenagh M.M. Whitney J.A. Carrol K. Zhang C.J. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Since mitochondria are capable of fission and fusion (45Bereiter-Hahn J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1989; 122: 1-63Google Scholar), it is possible that ARF binding and mono-ADP-ribosylation might reflect the presence of a membrane transport machinery in this organelle. As noted above, BFA is nearly equipotent in in vitro mono-ADP-ribosylation and ARF binding assays. Moreover, as previously reported, two synthetic analogs of BFA known to be inactive in preventing ARF binding to isolated Golgi membranes, B5 and B36, are also devoid of mono-ADP-ribosylation-stimulating activity (8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been suggested that the BFA-binding sites involved in the two activities are similar or identical (8De Matteis M.A. Di Girolamo M. Colanzi A. Pallas M. Di Tullio G. McDonald L.J. Moss J. Santini G. Bannykh S. Corda D. Luini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We wanted to perform a more stringent test of parallelism between the two activities by using a large variety of BFA-derived analogs, including the biologically inactive stereoisomer of BFA (7Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2099021510,"We isolated and characterized the human β-Trace protein (βTP) gene promoter. βTP, also known as prostaglandin D2 synthase, is a lipocalin secreted from the choroid plexus and meninges into cerebrospinal fluid. Basal transcription of the βTP gene is directed from a core promoter found within the first 325 bases of the 5′-flanking sequence. The βTP gene promoter is responsive to thyroid hormone (3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, T3) and efficiently repressed by unliganded human thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ). Functional analysis of the βTP promoter in TE671 cells revealed that responsiveness to T3 occurs in sequences 2.5 kilobase pairs 5′ of the start site. Within the hormone-responsive region we identified a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) located from −2576 to −2562 base pairs relative to the transcription start site. The βTP TRE is composed of two directly repeated consensus half-sites separated by a 3-base pair space (DR3). The βTP TRE forms specific complexes with TRβ. We have shown that a gene active in the choroid plexus and meninges is responsive to T3. T3 may play a role in the regulated transport of substances into the cerebrospinal fluid and ultimately the brain.

The βTP gene promoter is responsive to thyroid hormone (3,3′,5-triiodothyronine, T3) and efficiently repressed by unliganded human thyroid hormone receptor β (TRβ). Functional analysis of the βTP promoter in TE671 cells revealed that responsiveness to T3 occurs in sequences 2.5 kilobase pairs 5′ of the start site. Within the hormone-responsive region we identified a thyroid hormone response element (TRE) located from −2576 to −2562 base pairs relative to the transcription start site. The βTP TRE is composed of two directly repeated consensus half-sites separated by a 3-base pair space (DR3). The βTP TRE forms specific complexes with TRβ. We have shown that a gene active in the choroid plexus and meninges is responsive to T3. T3 may play a role in the regulated transport of substances into the cerebrospinal fluid and ultimately the brain. β-Trace protein (βTP) 1The abbreviations used are: βTPβ-Trace proteinCSFcerebrospinal fluidCNScentral nervous systemCPchoroid plexusCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseTRhuman thyroid hormone receptorsTRβhuman thyroid hormone receptor β1RXRαhuman retinoid X receptor αT3thyroid hormone (3,3′,5-triiodothyronine)TREthyroid hormone-responsive element; bp, base pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s)DR3direct repeat with 3-bp spacingIR1inverted repeat with 1-bp spacingrMErat malic enzymeTKthymidine kinasePGD2prostaglandin D2PDSprostaglandin D2 synthaseOLGoligonucleotidesβGALβ-galactosidaseLH-βluteinizing hormone subunit βIGF-IIinsulin-like growth factor II is a component of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and one of very few proteins found in CSF not also present in serum. In human CSF, βTP is present at 2.6 mg/dl, ranking it among the major CSF proteins (1Link H. Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 1967; 43: 1-136Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). βTP, identified by Clausen in 1961 (2Clausen J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1961; 107: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), is primarily expressed in the choroid plexus (CP). βTP is also expressed to a lesser extent in meninges and oligodendrocytes (3Hochwald G.M.

Neurochem. 1973; 21: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other than the CNS, the major site of βTP expression is the epididymis (4Olsson J.E. Nord L. J.

A role for PGD2 in regulation of sleep induction has been proposed (8Onoe H. Ueno R. Fujita I. Nishino H. Oomura Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, βTP and PDS were shown to be the same protein (10Zahn M. Mader M. Schmidt B. Bollensen E. Felgenhauer K. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 154: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 11Hoffmann A. Conradt H.S. Gross G. Nimtz M. Lottspeich F. Wurster U. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In prior studies we have referred to βTP/PDS as PDS but, in deference to precedence, we now refer to it as βTP (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human βTP message encodes a 180-residue polypeptide that is a member of the lipocalin superfamily. Lipocalins are secretory proteins that transport hydrophobic ligands (13Pervaiz S. Brew K. Science. 1985; 228: 335-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Ali S. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Lipocalin genes appear to have arisen by gene duplication, with most of them clustered in the q34 region of chromosome 9 in man and in the syntenic b-c region of chromosome 4 in the mouse (15Salier J.P. Simon D. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Muscatelli F. Gebhard W. Guenet J.L. Mattei M.G. Genomics. 1992; 14: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In previous work we localized the human βTP gene to the lipocalin gene cluster on 9q34. The βTP gene bears a striking resemblance to other lipocalin genes, suggesting a role for βTP in transport (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CSF, primarily produced by the CP, can be viewed as an ultra filtrate of serum with protein levels approximately 0.5% those in serum. Exchange of proteins and other substances between CSF and the extracellular fluid of the brain is free (16Segal M.B. J. Inherited. Metab. Dis. 1993; 16: 617-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The CP secretes highly specialized transporters that carry essential substances into the CSF and then to the brain. The primary function of the meninges is the maintenance of the blood-CSF barrier, but it also contributes to CSF and many substances enter into CSF equally well from either the meninges or CP. Cultured meningeal cells secrete many of the same transport proteins as the CP (17Ohe Y. Ishikawa K. Itoh Z. Tatemoto K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 964-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Several CSF transporters have been characterized including transthyretin, transferrin, and ceruloplasmin; they carry thyroxine, iron, and copper, respectively (18Nilsson C. Lindvall A.M. Owman C. Brain Res. Rev. 1992; 17: 109-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 19Aldred A.R. Brack C.M. Schreiber G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Commun. 1993; 196: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) found that levels of βTP mRNA in the CNS of adult rats decrease following chemically induced hypothyroidism. The mechanism by which thyroid hormone (T3) influences βTP gene expression is unknown. T3 exerts its effects through binding to thyroid hormone receptors (TR), which are widely distributed in the CNS (21Bradley D.J. Towle H.C. Young W.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the CP, T3 augments transport function; hypothyroid rats have reduced Na+-K+-ATPase activity, a marker for transport processes (22Lindvall-Axelsson M. Hedner P. Owman C. Winbladh B. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1985; 125: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To better understand mechanisms of βTP gene regulation, we subcloned the human βTP gene promoter and analyzed its expression in the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671. We identify a small core promoter that directs basal gene transcription at high levels and a distal element that determines T3 responsiveness. The 3.8-kbXho I-Xba I fragment from the βTP genomic clone pG4CS86 (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted into the Sma I site of pBSKS+, and approximately 1 kb of 3′ sequence was excised using the Exo III/mung bean nuclease system (Stratagene). The resulting fragment, spanning from −2759 to +65 bp, was subcloned into the CAT vector pJFCAT1 (23Fridovich-Keil J.L. Gudas J.M. Bryan I.B. Pardee A.B. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 572-579PubMed Google Scholar) to generate clone pCAT2759 (Fig. 1). Exo- and endonuclease deletions of pCAT2759 produced clones with successive 5′ deletions. Sequence was analyzed as described previously (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clone pCAT235 was produced by subcloning the region between −2759 and −2080 bp of the βTP promoter into pBSKS+. Small internal deletions were introduced into pCAT235 by digestion with Sty I andEco NI followed by Klenow fill-in or mung bean nuclease digestion to remove one or both of the βTP TRE half-sites, respectively. To liberate the inserts from the pBSKS+ vector, the constructs were opened with Bam HI, made blunt-ended with Klenow, and subsequently digested with Sal I. Gel-purified fragments were subcloned into the pBLCAT2 vector that had been opened first at the Hin dIII site and made blunt-ended with Klenow enzyme followed by digestion with Sal I. The three clones thus produced were as follows: 1) pTK680F, with the 680-bp fragment of pCAT235 in the forward orientation, 2) pTKΔ3′ with a 104-base internal deletion which removes the 3′ half-site of the TRE, and 3) pTKΔ5′ + 3′, with a 108-base internal deletion which removes both half-sites of the TRE. Clone pTK300, spanning bases bases−2759 to −2464 of the βTP promoter, was produced by deleting 385 bp of 3′ sequence from clone pTK680F by double digestion with Eco NI and Sal I. Clone pTK680R was produced by subcloning the 680-bpBam HI-Sal I fragment of pCAT235 into the corresponding sites of pBLCAT2. Clone pTKΔDR3 was produced from overlapping oligonucleotides cloned into theHin dIII-Xho I sites of pBLCAT2. Clone pTK100 was produced by PCR amplification of bases −2620 to −2518 bp of the βTP promoter using pCAT2759 as template and oligonucleotides that introduced a 5′ Hin dIII site and a 3′ Xho I site. PCR product was digested with Hin dIII and Xho I and subcloned into the corresponding sites in pBLCAT2. Total RNA was isolated from adult rat brain or TE671 cells using the method of Chomczynski et al. (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA was electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels containing 3% formaldehyde, capillary blotted onto a GeneScreen nylon membrane (DuPont NEN), and probed as described previously (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The host cell line used in these studies was the human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671 (ATCC CRL 8805) (25Chen T.R. Dorotinsky C. Macy M. Hay R. Nature. 1989; 340: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Stratton M.R. Darling J. Pilkington G.J. Lantos P.L. Reeves B.R. Cooper C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) and 40 βg/ml gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For TR cotransfections, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) was used. On the day preceding transfection, 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm culture dishes. Plasmid DNA was transfected into cells using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (27Keown W.A. Campbell C.R. Kucherlapati R.S. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For each dish, 1 pmol of CAT construct was co-transfected with 2 βg of β-galactosidase (βGAL) expression vector pRSV-βGAL (28Edlund T. Walker M.D. Barr P.J. Rutter W.J. Science. 1985; 230: 912-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) as an internal control. For TR cotransfections 2 βg of hTRβ1 expression vector was used (29Nakai A. Sakurai A. Macchia E. Fang V. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). pBSKS+ was added to bring the total DNA in each dish to 12 βg. Medium was replaced 18 h after transfection. Where necessary, T3 or hormone vehicle were introduced into the fresh medium at a final concentration of 100 nm. After 48 h the cells were harvested. pSV2CAT (30Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) was used throughout as a positive control vector for CAT expression, and pTK83 was used for T3/TR responses (31Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. Opsahl A. Sakurai A. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar). The negative control for CAT expression was the promoterless CAT vector pJFCAT1 and for T3 responses, pBLCAT2, which contains the TK promoter (32Luckow B. Günther S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). To correct for variations in transfection efficiency, cell extracts were assayed for βGAL activity (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.66Google Scholar). After adjusting for βGAL levels, CAT activity was determined using a variation of the diffusion assay (34Eastman A. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 731-732Google Scholar). All transfections were repeated at least four times. Data, reported as mean ± S.E., except where noted, are from three separate transfections. Transfected TE671 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and overlaid with a solution of 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactosidase, 2.5 mm ferri/ferrocyanide, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction proceeded overnight in the dark at 37 °C. Complementary oligonucleotides (OLG) spanning the regions shown in Fig. 7 A were used for gel retardation of the βTP TRE and IR1 elements. The βTP TRE OLGs were 5′-AGGCAGGGGGATGGCCTTGGTGACCTCTTAGGGTGGA-3′ and the complementary strand 5′-TGGCCTCCACCCTAAGAGGTCACCAAGGCCATCCCC-3′. The mutant TRE, ΔDR3, is similar to βTP TRE but introduces C → A or C → T mutations at bases −2573, −2572, −2564, and −2563. The IR1 OLGs were 5′-TTGACCACAGGGACTGAGGAGTCCGTCCTGA-3′ and the complementary strand 5′-TCGGTTCAGGACGGACTCCTCAGTCCCTGTG-3′. The positive control probe for TR binding was the rat malic enzyme promoter (rME) TRE (35Miyamoto T. Suzuki S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 224-231PubMed Google Scholar). Complementary OLGs were hybridized and 5′ overhangs filled in with Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. Labeled duplexes, purified on G50 columns, had a specific activity greater than 1.7 × 106 cpm/pmol. Recombinant human TRβ1 and RXRα were prepared as described by Sakurai et al. (36Sakurai A. Suzuki S. Katai M. Miyamoto T. Kobayashi H. Nakajima K. Ichikawa K. DeGroot L.J. Hashizume K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 10 fmol of labeled TRE (approximately 17,000 cpm), 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 28 ng/βl poly(dI-dC), 20–100 fmol of TRβ1, and/or 20–100 fmol of RXRα. Reactions proceeded at room temperature for 20 min. In supershift experiments, complexes were permitted to form for 20 min. 1 βl of anti-hTRβ polyclonal antibody β62 (37Falcone M. Miyamoto T. Fierro-Renoy F. Macchia E. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was then added followed by incubation for a further 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on non-denaturing 5% PAGE gels run at room temperature. The βTP promoter was isolated from the genomic clone pG4CS86 (12White D.M. Mikol D.D. Espinosa R. Weimer B. Le Beau M.M. Stefansson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23202-23208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To localize regions of the promoter important to βTP transcription, a set of 10 promoter-CAT gene fusion constructs with increasing 5′ deletions was produced, the 5′ termini ranging from −2759 to + 16 bp in the untranslated region (Fig. 1). The human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671 (25Chen T.R. Dorotinsky C. Macy M. Hay R. Nature. 1989; 340: 106Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Stratton M.R. Darling J. Pilkington G.J. Lantos P.L. Reeves B.R. Cooper C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 899-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) expresses βTP mRNA at high levels and transfects efficiently (Fig. 2). Parallel transfections of the 10 deletion constructs into TE671 cells revealed the βTP gene promoter to be highly active, generating CAT activity at a level comparable to the positive control vector pSV2CAT (30Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The βTP core promoter region is small, deletions from −2759 bp to −595 bp had minimal effects on βTP promoter activity. Deleting the bases between −595 and −325 actually increased βTP promoter activity 1.8-fold. Deletions within the 325-bp core promoter region results in major loss of activity (Fig. 1). The −80-bp clone is inactive, which localizes the sequences necessary for maximal basal activation of the βTP gene between −325 and −80 bp of the promoter. The sequence of the core promoter is presented in Fig. 3. The region from −227 to −180 bp of the βTP promoter has high sequence identity with regions of the human luteinizing hormone subunit β promoter (LH-β) (68% identity, bases −239 to −192) (38Jameson J.L. Lindell C.M. Habener J.F. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1986; 5: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and the human insulin-like growth factor II P4 promoter (80% identity, bases −318 to −287) (IGF-II) (39de Pagter-Holthuizen P. Jansen M. van der Kammen R.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Sussenbach J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The IGF-II P4 promoter is active in the CP (40Ohlsson R. Hedborg F. Holmgren L. Walsh C. Ekstrom T.J. Development. 1994; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 20-bp near-perfect palindrome (PAL I, bases −176 to −157) bears extended homology to the AP4 site originally identified in the SV40 enhancer (41Mermod N. Williams T.J. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 332: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and to the cAMP response element, ENKCRE-2, found within the proenkephalin gene promoter (42Comb M. Birnberg N.C. Seasholtz A. Herbert E. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1986; 323: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, the βTP promoter is only mildly responsive to forskolin (data not shown). In vivo analysis has shown that βTP mRNA expression is regulated by T3. To determine if the human promoter mounted transcriptional responses to T3 and TRβ, we studied T3 effects on the βTP promoter in TE671 cells. Results from reporter constructs (Fig. 4,top) and Western blot analysis (data not shown) indicate that TE671 cells do not express thyroid hormone receptors. Thus to determine if the human βTP gene responds to T3 and TRβ, the full-length clone, pCAT2759, was cotransfected with a TRβ expression vector (29Nakai A. Sakurai A. Macchia E. Fang V. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) into TE671 cells and cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nm T3. The results reveal that the βTP promoter is strongly regulated by TRβ in a T3-dependent manner (Fig. 4). βTP transcription is elevated 4-fold over basal levels in the presence of T3 and TRβ. Unliganded TRβ (no T3) represses the activity of the βTP promoter 12-fold compared with basal levels. When both effects are considered, βTP promoter activity is stimulated 45-fold by T3 over the level observed with unliganded TRβ alone. Fig. 4 also shows that the response of pCAT2759 to T3 and TRβ is in the range observed with the strong TRE of the rME-positive control, pTK83 (31Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. Opsahl A. Sakurai A. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 305-314PubMed Google Scholar). Varying the amount of TRβ expression vector cotransfected with CAT constructs did not alter the result (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, two heterologous promoter-CAT constructs, pSV2CAT and pBLCAT2, have responses to TRβ and T3 different from those observed for the βTP promoter, indicating that βTP promoter responses do not result from effects on cell viability or transcriptional competence. To identify the T3-responsive region of the βTP promoter, the deletion constructs (Fig. 1) were cotransfected with a TRβ expression vector or pBSKS sham control and cultured with 100 nm T3. Only the full-length clone, pCAT2759, shows activation by T3 and TRβ, localizing the T3 responsive region to the sequence between −2759 and −2018 bp (Fig. 5 A). There was no significant activation by T3 alone (pBSKS sham) over basal levels for any of the deletion constructs examined (data not shown). To account for the repressive effects from unliganded TRβ, the activity of the deletion constructs in the presence of T3 and TRβ was compared with that from TRβ alone. The results, shown in Fig.5 B, again demonstrate that only the −2759-bp clone possesses major responses to T3. Similar experiments were performed to identify the region responsible for TRβ-mediated repression. Deletion of the region responsible for T3 activation (−2759 to −2018 bp) barely altered repression by unliganded TRβ (Fig. 5 C). Repression by unliganded TRβ was alleviated by deletions inward from −1423 bp. Thus, repression occurs at alternative or additional sites to those responsible for T3-mediated activation. To characterize further the T3-responsive region of the βTP promoter, 680 bp of upstream sequence (−2759 bp to −2080 bp) was cloned upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter fused to the CAT gene as contained in the pBLCAT2 vector. T3 stimulates an 8-fold increase of CAT activity when the 680-bp fragment was cloned in the forward direction and 9.5-fold when cloned in the reverse orientation (Fig. 6). Thus the βTP promoter T3-responsive region also confers strong T3induction on the heterologous TK promoter in an orientation independent manner. To delineate the T3-responsive region of the upstream fragment, two constructs were produced that successively removed 5′ and 3′ sequence. In the first construct a deletion was introduced on the 3′ end of the 680-bp fragment, leaving the 295 bp of 5′ sequence (pTK300 in Fig. 6). The construct, pTK300, is nearly as active as the original 680-bp fragment (7.6-versus 8-fold activation), indicating that the 3′ sequence makes a negligible contribution to the T3 response. The second construct further narrowed the sequence on both 5′ and 3′ ends of the 300-bp construct, encompassing 102 bp from −2620 to −2518 bp of the βTP promoter (pTK100 in Fig. 6). The 102-bp construct is as effective as the 295-bp construct (7.5-versus 7.6-fold) and nearly as effective as the 680-bp construct, indicating that the T3-responsive region is located within sequence spanning −2620 to −2518 bp. The sequence between −2620 and −2518 bp was searched for half-sites that conformed to the general consensus 5′-PuGG(A/T)CPu-3′ (where Pu indicates a purine nucleoside) and that possessed the number and spacing of half-sites consistent with known TREs. Using this approach a TRE was identified between bases −2576 and −2562 bp (Fig.7 A), which is composed of two directly repeated half-sites separated by 3 bp (DR3). To test the role of the βTP TRE in directing the T3 responses, deletion analysis was used to remove the 3′ half-site and subsequently both half-sites of the TRE from the 680-bp fragment. Deletion of the 3′ site and 3′-flanking sequence results in a drop in activation by T3and TRβ from 8.0- to 2.9-fold (pTKΔ3′ in Fig.6). A similar deletion of both half-sites of the βTP TRE results in the loss of T3 induction (pTKΔ5′+3′ in Fig. 6). Thus deletion of the βTP TRE results in the loss of the T3 responses identified in the upstream fragment of the βTP promoter. Gel shift assays were used to determine if the βTP TRE formed specific complexes with TRβ. The binding of TRβ to the βTP TRE was compared with that of the DR4 type TRE from the rME promoter (43Petty K.J. Desvergne B. Mitsuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7395-7400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An IR1 type element, between bases −2110 and −2088 bp, which was determined not to contribute to T3 responses (data not shown), was used as a negative control (Fig. 7 A). The βTP TRE binds and shifts with TRβ homodimers and more intensely when the RXRα accessory protein is present (Fig. 7 B). The shifted bands are at levels of intensity similar to those obtained when the rME element is used, indicating formation of high affinity complexes between the βTP TRE and TRβ/RXRα. As expected, the IR1 element failed to bind TRβ and shifted only faintly in the presence of TRβ/RXRα (Fig. 7 C). To further characterize the βTP TRE, cold competitions were performed using the βTP TRE element itself or the rME element. As expected, unlabeled βTP TRE competes with labeled βTP TRE (Fig.8 A). The rME element competes effectively with the βTP TRE element for binding to TRβ indicating that βTP TRE forms complexes in the same fashion as rME (Fig.8 B). Within TRE half-sites, loss of one or both of the two conserved G nucleotides substantially reduces TR binding and TRE function (44Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 45Farsetti A. Desvergne B. Hallenbeck P. Robbins J. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15784-15788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the role of these nucleotides, a mutant βTP TRE was constructed (ΔDR3) in which the G residues at bases −2573–74 and −2564–63 were changed to T or A, respectively (Fig. 7 A). The reconfigured element, ΔDR3, failed to bind TRβ homodimers and bound TRβ/RXRα heterodimers only faintly (Fig. 8 C) proving that residues known to be crucial for TR binding in other TREs are also necessary for TR binding to the βTP TRE. Confirming the results from gel shift, placement of the mutant βTP TRE element upstream of the TK promoter within the pBLCAT2 vector failed to confer T3 responses to the TK-CAT construct in TE671 cells (construct pTKΔDR3 in Fig. 6). Thus, the intact sequence of the βTP TRE is necessary to bind TRβ and to activate transcription in response to T3 and TRβ. To probe the composition of the DNA-protein complexes, anti-hTRβ antibody was used to super-shift DNA-protein complexes that had formed with TRβ. βTP TRE-protein complexes, formed in the presence of TRβ or TRβ/RXRα, were shifted by antibody, demonstrating that the complexes with βTP TRE were formed by TRβ binding (Fig.8 D). Basal transcription of the β-Trace gene is directed from a small and highly active core promoter. The core promoter is found within the first 325 bp of upstream sequence and directs CAT gene expression in TE671 cells at a level similar to the pSV2CAT-positive control vector. Regions of the core promoter bear striking sequence identity to the P4 promoter of the IGF-II gene (39de Pagter-Holthuizen P. Jansen M. van der Kammen R.A. van Schaik F.M.A. Sussenbach J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 950: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), which is active in the choroid plexus (40Ohlsson R. Hedborg F. Holmgren L. Walsh C. Ekstrom T.J. Development. 1994; 120: 361-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and to the β-LH gene, which is active in the CNS (38Jameson J.L. Lindell C.M. Habener J.F. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1986; 5: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The human βTP gene is regulated by TRβ in a T3-dependent manner. T3 and TRβ substantially elevate βTP promoter activity, whereas unliganded TRβ effectively represses the promoter. The level of T3-dependent activation observed is comparable to that observed using a classical TRE from the rME promoter (43Petty K.J. Desvergne B. Mitsuhashi T. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7395-7400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the overall response of the βTP promoter to T3 is strong (Fig. 4). Deletion analyses indicate that the βTP thyroid hormone-responsive region lies between −2759 and −2018 bp. When placed upstream of the TK minimal promoter in either orientation, this region confers T3 regulation on the heterologous TK promoter. Further deletion analysis of βTP-TK promoter fusions allowed the T3-responsive region to be localized to the sequence between −2620 and −2518 bp, a region in which we have identified a TRE composed of two consensus half-sites separated by a 3-bp spacer (DR3-type). The 3′ half-site of the TRE exactly matches the general consensus half-site, and its deletion results in substantial although not complete loss of T3 induction. Deletion of both half-sites completely abolishes T3 induction. As with other TREs, T3 induction from the βTP TRE is lost with mutation of the two conserved G nucleotides within each half-site. Gel shift experiments demonstrate that the βTP TRE forms specific complexes with both TRβ homodimers and TRβ·RXRα heterodimers. We used cold competitions with the rME TRE, mutagenesis of the βTP TRE, and super-shifts with anti-TRβ specific antibodies to demonstrate that βTP TRE binds to and interacts with TRβ in a manner consistent with other TRE sequences. The βTP TRE is well upstream of the core promoter. This organization places the βTP promoter in a growing family of genes distinguished by TRE elements distal to the core promoter. These include the human insulin gene where the TRE is located at −1 kb (46Clark A.R. Wilson M.E. London N.J. James R.F. Docherty K. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the rat S14 gene which has multiple TREs located in a 200-bp region around −2.6 kb (47Liu H.C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037PubMed Google Scholar), and the rat ucp gene which has two TREs located in the region around −2.3 kb (48Rabelo R. Schifman A. Rubio A. Sheng X. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 49Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Larose M. Matamala J.C. Champigny O. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24335-24342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the βTP TRE and one of the ucp TREs, the downstream TRE, are composed of two directly repeated half-sites separated by a 3-bp spacer. Directly repeated half-sites with three base pair separations are commonly associated with vitamin D receptors in accordance with the 3,4,5 rule (44Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 1255-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 50Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). However, the rat ucp downstream TRE is unresponsive to induction by vitamin D receptors, indicating that DR3-type TREs are capable of T3-specific responses (48Rabelo R. Schifman A. Rubio A. Sheng X. Silva J.E. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1003-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Additionally, in vitro analyses have shown that DR3 elements can bind TR and direct T3 responses at or near the level observed with the more common DR4 spacing (51Miyamoto T. Suzuki S. DeGroot L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 102: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The sequences flanking the half-sites may prove to be more important in honing the T3 response of the βTP TRE than the spacings between the half-sites. Koenig et al. (52Katz R.W. Subauste J.S. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5238-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have identified an extended consensus half-site sequence which functions as an equally strong TRE regardless of whether the spacing between the half-sites is 3, 4, or 5 bp. A similar dependence on half-site and flanking sequence, independent of half-site spacing, has been noted for the closely related retinoic acid receptor elements (53Mader S. Leroy P. Chen J.-Y. Chambon P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The βTP promoter shows considerable T3-independent repression by TRβ (54Damm K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1989; 339: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Repression appears to be specific for the βTP promoter as two heterologous promoters used in this study (SV2 and TK) are only mildly affected by unliganded TRβ. Deletion of the sequences responsible for T3 activation does not alleviate repression. Repression may result from TR binding to TRE half-sites located elsewhere in the promoter. TRE half-sites can comprise a functional element in TRE-mediated repression (55Carr F.E. Wong N.C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4175-4179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Cohen O. Flynn T.R. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13899-13905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally, unliganded TR might disrupt protein-protein interactions necessary for transcription as has been observed in the human glycoprotein hormone α gene (57Madison L.D. Ahlquist J.A. Rogers S.D. Jameson J.L. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 94: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TE671 cells express βTP but not TRβ. These properties permitted the examination of basal βTP promoter activity in the absence of the potentially confounding effects of TRβ. Subsequent expression of TRβ in TE671 cells allowed dissection of the repressive effects of TRβ on βTP basal transcription from the more familiar role of TRβ in activation. The basal activity of the βTP promoter observed in TE671 cells in the absence of TRβ may be physiologically relevant. Although TR expression is widespread it is not universal (37Falcone M. Miyamoto T. Fierro-Renoy F. Macchia E. DeGroot L.J. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2419-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 58Jannini E.A. Dolci S. Ulisse S. Nikodem V.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The increase in the activity of the βTP promoter by T3and TRβ and its repression by TRβ alone, as shown here, agrees with and provides a dual mechanism for the reduced βTP mRNA levels observed in thyroidectomized rats (20Garcı́a-Fernández L.F. Iniguez M.A. Rodriguez P.A. Munoz A. Bernal J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The thyroid hormone responsiveness of the βTP promoter may also imply T3control of PGD2 synthesis. However, the high levels of βTP and βTP promoter activity observed should be contrasted to the low levels of PGD2 observed in human CSF (59Westcott J.Y. Murphy R.C. Stenmark K. Prostaglandins. 1987; 34: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Perhaps βTP functions as a ligand transporter within the CNS, as is the case for other proteins secreted by the CP and meninges. The structural similarity between βTP and other lipocalin transporters provides indirect support for a role in lipid transport. Further support for the role of βTP in transport processes has recently been provided by the work of Hoffmann et al. (60Hoffmann A. Bachner D. Betat N. Lauber J. Gross G. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 332-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) who, in a careful in situ analysis of βTP expression in the developing mouse, have observed βTP expression at or near a number of blood-tissue barriers, hinting at a role for βTP in transport across these barriers. The present study indicates that T3 exerts a measure of control over βTP gene expression. If βTP functions to transport a specific ligand into CSF then T3 potentially exerts a general level of control over the availability of the ligand in the CNS. Important questions regarding the regulation of βTP transcription remain to be addressed. Foremost among them is whether the expression of βTP is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, implying the use of different enhancer elements within the βTP promoter or different combinations of tissue-specific transcription factors. Additionally, the role of T3 on βTP expression must be examined in the context of the other tissues in which it is expressed. We thank Dr. Mark A. Jensen for critically reading the manuscript."

Of these hydroxylation sites, it is now accepted that the sequential oxidation and cleavage of the side chain initiated by the hydroxylation at C-24 catalyzed by mitochondrial 1α,25(OH)2D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24) is the major pathway by which the hormone is inactivated (5Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because transcription of the CYP24 gene is highly up-regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in its target cells (6Armbrecht H.J. Boltz M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Shinki T. Jin C.H. Nishimura A. Nagai Y. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Suda T. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CYP24 is regarded as the key enzyme for the breakdown of the hormone (9Suda T. Shinki T. Kurokawa K. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1994; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Metabolism of 1α,25(OH)2D3 initiated by C-23 hydroxylation is induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3itself (10Siu-Caldera M.-L. Zou L. Ehrlich M.G. Schwartz E.R. Ishizuka S. Reddy G.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4195-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant human CYP24 also catalyzes C-23 hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3(25(OH)D3) to yield 23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (23S,25(OH)2D3) (11Beckman M.J. Tadikonda P. Werner E. Prahl J. Yamada S. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that CYP24 initiates both C-24 and C-23 hydroxylation pathways of 1α,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, mitochondrial vitamin d-25-hydroxylase (CYP27) catalyzes the hydroxylation at C-25 and C-26 of vitamin D3and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1α(OH)D3) (12Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether or not this enzyme hydroxylates C-26 of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Recently, a model for the mechanism of the hydroxylation site selection by CYP24 and CYP27 was proposed. This model postulates that CYP24 directs its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance of C-24 and C-23 from the vitamin D ring structure and that CYP27 does so by the distance between the hydroxylation sites and the end of the side chain (13Dilworth F.J.

Although the biological activity of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 was higher, the binding affinity of this analog to VDR was almost identical to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (16Shiina Y. Abe E. Miyaura C. Tanaka H.

It is accepted that the resistance of the C-F bond at C-24 of this analog to metabolic inactivation contributes to its higher biological activity. The metabolic fate of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3, however, has not yet been clarified. We recently reported that F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 is metabolized into a more polar compound(s) in rat osteoblastic ROB-C26 cells (17Miyamoto Y. Shinki T. Ohyama Y. Kasama T. Iwasaki H. Hosotani R. Sato T. Suda T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The metabolism was initiated after transcription of the CYP24 gene, which was induced by the substrate, F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 itself (17Miyamoto Y. Shinki T. Ohyama Y. Kasama T. Iwasaki H. Hosotani R. Sato T. Suda T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).In this study, we examined whether CYP24 can metabolize vitamin D analogs, the C-24 of which is resistant to hydroxylation. We identified 24,24-difluoro-1α,25,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3(F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3) as a major metabolite of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 was CYP24.DISCUSSIONCYP24 was discovered as the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation at C-24 in the metabolism of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that human recombinant CYP24 also catalyzes the C-23 hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 (11Beckman M.J. Tadikonda P. Werner E. Prahl J. Yamada S. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), indicating that this enzyme has multicatalytic functions. However, there is no evidence that CYP24 hydroxylates any other carbons than C-24 or C-23 of vitamin D compounds. In this study, we showed that F2-1α,25(OH)2D3, C-24 of which is protected from the hydroxylation by fluorination, is metabolized into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 by a 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced enzyme in the rat kidney (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The enzyme involved in this hydroxylation was CYP24 (Figs. 4 and 5A). This is the first report to describe that CYP24 hydroxylates a carbon other than C-24 and C-23 of vitamin D compounds. It is generally accepted that the fluorine atom mimics the hydrogen atom. A computer analysis confirmed that 24,24-F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 was very similar to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3, though the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of the fluorine atom were stronger than those of the hydrogen atom (data not shown). Thus the possibility cannot be ruled out at present that the fluorine atoms at C-24 influence the susceptibility of the neighboring carbons to CYP24. Hydroxylation at C-26 of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 made C-25 asymmetric. The stereochemical configuration at C-25 of this metabolite has yet to be determined.According to the model proposed by Dilworth et al., CYP24 selects its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance from the vitamin D ring structure (13Dilworth F.J.

The results of the present study, however, suggest that the hydroxylation site selected by the enzyme is not necessarily strict and that CYP24 can hydroxylate a carbon other than C-24 and C-23 when C-24 is protected from metabolic hydroxylation. Therefore, it is highly likely that CYP24 is also responsible for the C-26 hydroxylation of the vitamin D3 metabolites in vivo. At present, the possibility cannot be excluded that enzymes other than CYP24, such as CYP27, hydroxylate C-26 of 1α,25(OH)2D3in vivo. In fact, CYP27 reportedly hydroxylates C-25 and C-26 of vitamin D3and 1α(OH)D3 (12Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, however, kidney homogenates obtained from rats given either 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle did not metabolize vitamin D3 into 25(OH)D3 or other metabolites (data not shown), indicating that no CYP27 is present in the kidney. In addition, CYP27-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells did not metabolize F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 (Fig.5B). Therefore, the C-26 hydroxylation of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 in kidney homogenates does not appear to be mediated by CYP27.Two methyl groups at C-25 of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (or 25(OH)D3) are heterotopic. Hydroxylation of one of the methyls yields a new chiral center at C-25. Hydroxylation of the pro-S-methyl group produces 25R configuration and pro-R-methyl group 25S configuration. Two types of 26-oxygenated vitamin D3 metabolites have been found; one is the metabolites with 25S configuration such as 1α,25S,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3 (26Partridge J.J. Shiuey S.-J. Chandha N.K.

It has also been reported that natural 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is a mixture of 25R- and 25S-isomers (30Ikekawa N. Noizumi N. Ohshima E. Ishizuka S. Takeshita T. Tanaka Y DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl.

These results suggest that there are two C-26 hydroxylation enzymes; one catalyzes the hydroxylation of the pro-S-methyl and the other catalyzes the pro-R-methyl. It may be likely that these two types of hydroxylation at C-26 are catalyzed by CYP24 and CYP27, respectively. The stereochemical configuration at C-25 of the metabolite X, F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3, is now under investigation.CYP24 has been found in all the target tissues of vitamin D that possess VDR (31Pike J.W.

The presence of the two VDREs in the CYP24 gene promoter may be important for regulating intracellular concentration as well as the half-life of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Makin et al. reported that the target cells of vitamin D metabolize 1α,25(OH)2D3 sequentially into calcitroic acid by the 24-oxidation pathway (5Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Using a bacterially expressed enzyme, Akiyoshi-Shibata et al. showed that CYP24 alone can catalyze all of the following reactions; 1α,25(OH)2D3 → 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3 → 24-oxo-1α,25(OH)2D3 → 24-oxo-1α,23S,25(OH)3D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ability of CYP24 to catalyze not only 24-hydroxylation but also its successive reactions implies that the role of this enzyme is to decrease the binding affinity of vitamin D compounds to VDR in the target cells, because 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3 still has about 40% of the affinity of 1α,25(OH)2D3 for VDR (36Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the bacterially expressed CYP24 also catalyzed the sequential metabolism of 25(OH)D3, namely 25(OH)D3 → 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 → 24-oxo-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 → 24-oxo-23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, theKm value of the enzyme for 1α,25(OH)2D3 was one-tenth of that for 25(OH)D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that the former is the real substrate of CYP24.In conclusion, CYP24 appears to solely regulate the intracellular concentration of the VDR ligand and hence the VDR-mediated transactivation in the target cells of vitamin D. It is highly likely that CYP24 catalyzes all three known catabolic pathways of 1α,25(OH)2D3, namely the C-23, C-24, and C-26 hydroxylation pathways, further emphasizing the importance of this enzyme in regulating vitamin D metabolism and function.

Of these hydroxylation sites, it is now accepted that the sequential oxidation and cleavage of the side chain initiated by the hydroxylation at C-24 catalyzed by mitochondrial 1α,25(OH)2D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24) is the major pathway by which the hormone is inactivated (5Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Because transcription of the CYP24 gene is highly up-regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 in its target cells (6Armbrecht H.J. Boltz M.A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Shinki T. Jin C.H. Nishimura A. Nagai Y. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Suda T. J. Biol.

Hypertens. 1994; 3: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Metabolism of 1α,25(OH)2D3 initiated by C-23 hydroxylation is induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3itself (10Siu-Caldera M.-L. Zou L. Ehrlich M.G. Schwartz E.R. Ishizuka S. Reddy G.S. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4195-4203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recombinant human CYP24 also catalyzes C-23 hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3(25(OH)D3) to yield 23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (23S,25(OH)2D3) (11Beckman M.J. Tadikonda P. Werner E. Prahl J. Yamada S. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that CYP24 initiates both C-24 and C-23 hydroxylation pathways of 1α,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, mitochondrial vitamin d-25-hydroxylase (CYP27) catalyzes the hydroxylation at C-25 and C-26 of vitamin D3and 1α-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1α(OH)D3) (12Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether or not this enzyme hydroxylates C-26 of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Recently, a model for the mechanism of the hydroxylation site selection by CYP24 and CYP27 was proposed. This model postulates that CYP24 directs its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance of C-24 and C-23 from the vitamin D ring structure and that CYP27 does so by the distance between the hydroxylation sites and the end of the side chain (13Dilworth F.J.

Although the biological activity of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 was higher, the binding affinity of this analog to VDR was almost identical to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (16Shiina Y. Abe E. Miyaura C. Tanaka H.

It is accepted that the resistance of the C-F bond at C-24 of this analog to metabolic inactivation contributes to its higher biological activity. The metabolic fate of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3, however, has not yet been clarified. We recently reported that F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 is metabolized into a more polar compound(s) in rat osteoblastic ROB-C26 cells (17Miyamoto Y. Shinki T. Ohyama Y. Kasama T. Iwasaki H. Hosotani R. Sato T. Suda T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The metabolism was initiated after transcription of the CYP24 gene, which was induced by the substrate, F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 itself (17Miyamoto Y. Shinki T. Ohyama Y. Kasama T. Iwasaki H. Hosotani R. Sato T. Suda T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether CYP24 can metabolize vitamin D analogs, the C-24 of which is resistant to hydroxylation. We identified 24,24-difluoro-1α,25,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3(F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3) as a major metabolite of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3. Moreover, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 was CYP24. DISCUSSIONCYP24 was discovered as the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation at C-24 in the metabolism of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that human recombinant CYP24 also catalyzes the C-23 hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 (11Beckman M.J. Tadikonda P. Werner E. Prahl J. Yamada S. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), indicating that this enzyme has multicatalytic functions. However, there is no evidence that CYP24 hydroxylates any other carbons than C-24 or C-23 of vitamin D compounds. In this study, we showed that F2-1α,25(OH)2D3, C-24 of which is protected from the hydroxylation by fluorination, is metabolized into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 by a 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced enzyme in the rat kidney (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The enzyme involved in this hydroxylation was CYP24 (Figs. 4 and 5A). This is the first report to describe that CYP24 hydroxylates a carbon other than C-24 and C-23 of vitamin D compounds. It is generally accepted that the fluorine atom mimics the hydrogen atom. A computer analysis confirmed that 24,24-F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 was very similar to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3, though the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of the fluorine atom were stronger than those of the hydrogen atom (data not shown). Thus the possibility cannot be ruled out at present that the fluorine atoms at C-24 influence the susceptibility of the neighboring carbons to CYP24. Hydroxylation at C-26 of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 made C-25 asymmetric. The stereochemical configuration at C-25 of this metabolite has yet to be determined.According to the model proposed by Dilworth et al., CYP24 selects its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance from the vitamin D ring structure (13Dilworth F.J. Scott I. Green A. Strugnell S. Guo Y.-D. Roberts E.A. Kremer R. Calverley M.J. Makin H.L.J. Jones G. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is highly likely that CYP24 is also responsible for the C-26 hydroxylation of the vitamin D3 metabolites in vivo. At present, the possibility cannot be excluded that enzymes other than CYP24, such as CYP27, hydroxylate C-26 of 1α,25(OH)2D3in vivo. In fact, CYP27 reportedly hydroxylates C-25 and C-26 of vitamin D3and 1α(OH)D3 (12Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Under our conditions, however, kidney homogenates obtained from rats given either 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle did not metabolize vitamin D3 into 25(OH)D3 or other metabolites (data not shown), indicating that no CYP27 is present in the kidney.

May B.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2410-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and at −259 to −245 (VDRE-2) (35Zierold C. Darwish H.M. DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in rats. The presence of the two VDREs in the CYP24 gene promoter may be important for regulating intracellular concentration as well as the half-life of 1α,25(OH)2D3. Makin et al. reported that the target cells of vitamin D metabolize 1α,25(OH)2D3 sequentially into calcitroic acid by the 24-oxidation pathway (5Makin G. Lohnes D. Byford V. Ray R. Jones G. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Using a bacterially expressed enzyme, Akiyoshi-Shibata et al. showed that CYP24 alone can catalyze all of the following reactions; 1α,25(OH)2D3 → 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3 → 24-oxo-1α,25(OH)2D3 → 24-oxo-1α,23S,25(OH)3D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The ability of CYP24 to catalyze not only 24-hydroxylation but also its successive reactions implies that the role of this enzyme is to decrease the binding affinity of vitamin D compounds to VDR in the target cells, because 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3 still has about 40% of the affinity of 1α,25(OH)2D3 for VDR (36Bouillon R. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 200-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the bacterially expressed CYP24 also catalyzed the sequential metabolism of 25(OH)D3, namely 25(OH)D3 → 24R,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 → 24-oxo-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 → 24-oxo-23S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, theKm value of the enzyme for 1α,25(OH)2D3 was one-tenth of that for 25(OH)D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that the former is the real substrate of CYP24.In conclusion, CYP24 appears to solely regulate the intracellular concentration of the VDR ligand and hence the VDR-mediated transactivation in the target cells of vitamin D. It is highly likely that CYP24 catalyzes all three known catabolic pathways of 1α,25(OH)2D3, namely the C-23, C-24, and C-26 hydroxylation pathways, further emphasizing the importance of this enzyme in regulating vitamin D metabolism and function. CYP24 was discovered as the enzyme responsible for the hydroxylation at C-24 in the metabolism of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 (25Akiyoshi-Shibata M. Sasaki T. Ohyama Y. Noshiro M. Okuda K. Yabusaki Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that human recombinant CYP24 also catalyzes the C-23 hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 (11Beckman M.J. Tadikonda P. Werner E. Prahl J. Yamada S. DeLuca H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8465-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), indicating that this enzyme has multicatalytic functions. However, there is no evidence that CYP24 hydroxylates any other carbons than C-24 or C-23 of vitamin D compounds. In this study, we showed that F2-1α,25(OH)2D3, C-24 of which is protected from the hydroxylation by fluorination, is metabolized into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 by a 1α,25(OH)2D3-induced enzyme in the rat kidney (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The enzyme involved in this hydroxylation was CYP24 (Figs. 4 and 5A). This is the first report to describe that CYP24 hydroxylates a carbon other than C-24 and C-23 of vitamin D compounds. It is generally accepted that the fluorine atom mimics the hydrogen atom. A computer analysis confirmed that 24,24-F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 was very similar to that of 1α,25(OH)2D3, though the electronegativity and hydrophobicity of the fluorine atom were stronger than those of the hydrogen atom (data not shown). Thus the possibility cannot be ruled out at present that the fluorine atoms at C-24 influence the susceptibility of the neighboring carbons to CYP24. Hydroxylation at C-26 of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 made C-25 asymmetric. The stereochemical configuration at C-25 of this metabolite has yet to be determined. According to the model proposed by Dilworth et al., CYP24 selects its hydroxylation site(s) by the distance from the vitamin D ring structure (13Dilworth F.J. Scott I. Green A. Strugnell S. Guo Y.-D.

The results of the present study, however, suggest that the hydroxylation site selected by the enzyme is not necessarily strict and that CYP24 can hydroxylate a carbon other than C-24 and C-23 when C-24 is protected from metabolic hydroxylation. Therefore, it is highly likely that CYP24 is also responsible for the C-26 hydroxylation of the vitamin D3 metabolites in vivo. At present, the possibility cannot be excluded that enzymes other than CYP24, such as CYP27, hydroxylate C-26 of 1α,25(OH)2D3in vivo. In fact, CYP27 reportedly hydroxylates C-25 and C-26 of vitamin D3and 1α(OH)D3 (12Guo Y.-D. Strugnell S. Back D.W. Jones G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8668-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Under our conditions, however, kidney homogenates obtained from rats given either 1α,25(OH)2D3 or vehicle did not metabolize vitamin D3 into 25(OH)D3 or other metabolites (data not shown), indicating that no CYP27 is present in the kidney. In addition, CYP27-transfected ROS17/2.8 cells did not metabolize F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 into F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3 (Fig.5B). Therefore, the C-26 hydroxylation of F2-1α,25(OH)2D3 in kidney homogenates does not appear to be mediated by CYP27. Two methyl groups at C-25 of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (or 25(OH)D3) are heterotopic. Hydroxylation of one of the methyls yields a new chiral center at C-25. Hydroxylation of the pro-S-methyl group produces 25R configuration and pro-R-methyl group 25S configuration. Two types of 26-oxygenated vitamin D3 metabolites have been found; one is the metabolites with 25S configuration such as 1α,25S,26-trihydroxyvitamin D3 (26Partridge J.J. Shiuey S.-J. Chandha N.K.

Soc. 1981; 103: 1253-1255Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the other is those with 25R configuration such as 25R-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23S-lactone (28Yamada S. Nakayama K. Takayama H. Shinki T. Takasaki Y. Suda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 884-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1α,25R-dihydroxyvitamin D3-26,23S-lactone (29Ishizuka S. Oshida J. Tsuruta H. Norman A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 242: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and their precursors. It has also been reported that natural 25,26-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is a mixture of 25R- and 25S-isomers (30Ikekawa N. Noizumi N. Ohshima E. Ishizuka S. Takeshita T. Tanaka Y DeLuca H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5286-5288Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results suggest that there are two C-26 hydroxylation enzymes; one catalyzes the hydroxylation of the pro-S-methyl and the other catalyzes the pro-R-methyl. It may be likely that these two types of hydroxylation at C-26 are catalyzed by CYP24 and CYP27, respectively. The stereochemical configuration at C-25 of the metabolite X, F2-1α,25,26(OH)3D3, is now under investigation. CYP24 has been found in all the target tissues of vitamin D that possess VDR (31Pike J.W.

Northern blotting has revealed that the expression of this enzyme is induced exclusively by 1α,25(OH)2D3 at the transcriptional level (6Armbrecht H.J.

https://openalex.org/W2030560043,"Hamster UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol-P GlcNAc-1-P transferase (GPT), which initiates N-linked glycosylation by catalyzing the synthesis of GlcNAc-P-P-dolichol, has multiple transmembrane spans and a catalytic site that probably exists on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (Dan, N., Middleton, R. M., and Lehrman, M. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 30717–30725). In this report, we demonstrate that GPT forms functional oligomers, probably dimers. Oligomers were detected by chemical cross-linking of GPT and by a dominant-negative effect caused by co-expression of enzymatically inactive (but properly folded) GPT mutants. The GPT mutants had no effect on two other dolichol-P-dependent endoplasmic reticulum enzymes. Mixing experiments indicated that mature GPT was competent for oligomerization. Oligomerization appeared to be favored in detergent extracts compared with intact microsomes. Detergent treatments were found to prevent, rather than promote, nonspecific aggregation of GPT. These results demonstrate that GPT subunits can physically interact and influence each other. The implications of oligomerization for enzyme function are discussed. From these results, we conclude that GPT is one of a very small number of multitransmembrane span enzymes that can form multimers."
https://openalex.org/W2020754722,"Stress-induced expression of the heat shock (hs) genes in eukaryotes is mediated by a transcription factor known as heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). HSF1 is present in a latent, monomeric form in unstressed metazoan cells and upon exposure to heat or other forms of stress is converted to an “active” trimeric form, which binds the promoters of hs genes and induces their transcription. The conversion of HSF1 to its active form is hypothesized to be a multistep process involving (i) oligomerization of HSF1, plus (ii) additional changes in its physical conformation, (iii) changes in its phosphorylation state, and for some species (iv) translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Oligomerization of HSF appears to be essential for high affinity DNA binding, but it remains unclear whether the other steps occur in all organisms or what their mechanistic roles are. In this study we have examined if heat-induced cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of HSF1 occurs in Xenopus oocytes. We observed that germinal vesicles (nuclei) that were physically dissected from unshocked Xenopus laevis oocytes contain no HSF1 binding activity. Interestingly, in vitro heat shock treatments of isolated nuclei from unshocked oocytes activated HSF1 binding, indicating that HSF1 must have been present in the unshocked nuclei prior to isolation. Induction of HSF1 binding was not observed in enucleated oocytes. Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody made against X. laevis HSF1 showed that HSF1 is present in equal amounts in unshocked and shocked oocytes and isolated nuclei. HSF1 was not detected in enucleated oocytes. These results clearly demonstrate that HSF1 is a nuclear protein in oocytes prior to exposure to stress. In Xenopus oocytes, therefore, HSF1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is not part of the multistep process of HSF1 activation.

Different species possess different numbers of HSF genes. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, andKluyveromyces lactis) and Drosophila melanogaster appear to have a single HSF gene, whereas most vertebrates and higher plants studied appear to have multiple HSF genes (7Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Species with multiple HSFs may not express all genes in each cell type (8Sarge K.D. Zimarino V. Holm K. Wu C. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1902-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), but all cells appear to express the stress-inducible form of HSF, which is generally known as HSF1. The other HSFs are likely involved in responding to other stimuli. For example, HSF2, an HSF found in humans, mice, and chickens, does not appear to be activated by the same stress agents that HSF1 responds to, but is found to be active during embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, and erythroid differentiation (9Sistonen L.

In metazoans, HSF1 exists predominantly as an apparent monomer in unshocked cells that is converted to a homotrimer upon exposure to stress (12Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 13Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Baler R. Dahl G.

Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), and it is the trimeric form of HSF which is capable of binding to HSEs with high affinity. In the yeasts S. cerevisiae and K. lactis, HSF1 is trimeric and bound to high affinity HSEs prior to exposure to stress (16Sorger P.K. Cell. 1991; 65: 363-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and additional HSEs are occupied upon exposure to stress (17Giardina C. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2737-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that stress may cause other physical changes in HSF1 such that certain domains involved in the transcriptional activation of hs genes move from a “buried” to an “exposed” location (7Wu C.

Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized that HSF1 activity is regulated in part by its subcellular localization (14Baler R.

InDrosophila, HSF1 is reported to be a nuclear protein before and after heat stress (12Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 24Wu C.

In mammalian cells, HSF1 has been reported to always be a nuclear protein by some investigators (24Wu C. Clos J. Giorgi G. Haroun R.I. Kim S.-J. Rabindran S.K. Westwood J.T. Wisniewski J. Yim G.

Using several assays we show thatXenopus HSF1 is a nuclear protein prior to and following exposure to heat stress. This result has important implications in identifying the signaling mechanisms by which heat and other inducers activate HSF1 in vivo. X. laevis A6 cells were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) diluted 2:3 in double distilled water supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5% fetal clone II (HyClone), 5% Cool Calf 2 (Sigma), 20 μg/ml gentamycin (Sigma). Cells were grown at 21 °C in T-75 tissue culture flasks (Starstedt). Heat-shocked cells were prepared by immersion of T-flasks in a circulating water bath at the temperatures indicated in the figure legends. Pieces of ovary were surgically removed from mature X. laevis frogs (a gift of Y. Masui, Department of Zoology, University of Toronto, and from Xenopus 1) and the connective tissue was digested with 0.2% collagenase type IV (Sigma) in calcium-free OR-2 (27Wallace R.A. Jared D.W. Dumont J.N. Sega M.W. J. Exp. Zool. 1973; 184: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) or in Steinberg's buffer (28Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Development. 1990; 110: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar). Stage VI oocytes were selected and were stored in either OR-2 with 1 mm oxaloacetate (29Eppig J.J. Steckman M.L. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or Steinberg's buffer. Germinal vesicles (GVs) were prepared either under oil as described by Paineet al. (30Paine P.L. Johnson M.E. Lau Y.-T. Tluczek L.J.M. Miller D.S. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar) or under Steinberg's buffer. For heat shock experiments, oocytes or germinal vesicles were transferred to 1.5- or 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes in their storage solution and then immersed in a circulating water bath at the temperatures indicated in the figure legends. Control samples were handled in the same fashion but kept at room temperature (18–21 °C). Cells were scraped into the medium and pelleted. For whole cell extracts to be used in Western blot analyses, the medium was removed, the pellets resuspended in three volumes of 1 × SDS sample buffer (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 10.2.2-10.2.35Google Scholar) and then sonicated for 10 s at setting 7 with a Heat Systems Ultrasonic sonicator. For EMSA extracts, the medium was removed and the pellets frozen in liquid nitrogen. Pellets were thawed and resuspended with 5 volumes extraction buffer (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Oocyte and GV extracts were prepared for Western blot and EMSA as outlined by Karn et al. (32Karn H. Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). HSF1 DNA binding activity was analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. For experiments described in Figs. 1(A and B) and 2B, binding reactions contained 10 μg of A6 protein extract (as determined by Bradford protein assay; Bio-Rad) or 0.5 of an oocyte or GV, 1 μl of 10 × buffer mix (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 30% glycerol, w/v) and 1 μl of 10 × bovine serum albumin/nucleotide mix (20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.5 mg/ml Escherichia coli DNA, 2 mg/ml tRNA, 0.2 mg/ml poly(dN)6, 0.5 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)/poly(dI-dC), NaCl to 200 mm final concentration, and double distilled water to 9 μl. This mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. 1 μl of 32P-labeled HSE (0.2 pmol) (22Winegarden N.A. Wong K.S. Sopta M. Westwood J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26971-26980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was then added to the above mixture. Binding reactions were then allowed to proceed for 10 min at room temperature (18–21 °C), after which 2 μl of 6 × loading dye (0.25% bromphenol blue, 30% glycerol, 3 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer) was added. Samples were electrophoresed, dried, and exposed to film as described previously (22Winegarden N.A. Wong K.S. Sopta M. Westwood J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26971-26980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For supershift experiments, 1 μl of an appropriate dilution of antibody in double distilled water was added after incubation of HSE probe with the protein extract. This mixture was further incubated at room temperature for 5 min before addition of loading dye. For the experiment described in Fig. 3 B, the EMSA was performed in the same manner as above except that the binding reaction did not contain any bovine serum albumin. For the experiment described in Fig. 1 C, EMSA was performed as described by Gordon et al. (33Gordon S. Bharadwaj S. Hnatov A. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions contained protein extract from 1 oocyte, GV, or enucleated oocyte with 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)/poly(dI-dC), 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min, and immediately loaded onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 6.7 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 3.3 mm sodium acetate. Gels were electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 150 V, dried, and exposed to x-ray film.Figure 3Xenopus HSF1 is present in the nuclei of oocytes under nonshock and heat shock conditions.

The band corresponding to XlHSF1 is indicated. B, the HSF·HSE complex from an EMSA was excised, electroeluted, then subjected to Western blot analysis using crude anti-MBP+XlHSF1 (1:2000).

E. coli containing either MBP or MBP+XlHSF1 constructs were induced to overexpress, and induced proteins were purified essentially as per manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Antibodies were produced to MBP+XlHSF1 in rabbits by an initial injection of 1.5 mg of purified antigen mixed 1:1 in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by 5 boosts every 3 weeks with 0.75 mg of antigen mixed 1:1 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Anti-XlHSF1 was affinity-purified following a procedure described by Harlow and Lane (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-318Google Scholar). Briefly, crude antiserum was passed over Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) coupled to MBP until all the anti-MBP antibodies had been removed (as tested by Western blot analysis). The anti-MBP-depleted serum was passed over an Affi-Gel column coupled with MBP+XlHSF1. Bound antibodies were first eluted with low pH buffer followed by high pH buffer (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-318Google Scholar). The antibodies eluted with low pH buffer contained anti-XlHSF1 activity (as tested by EMSA and Western blot analysis) and were used in the subsequent experiments. Proteins fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% acrylamide gels) were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and the blots were blocked with 5% powdered milk in TBST (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Antibodies were diluted in 2% gelatin (Bio-Rad) in TBST (1:1000 for crude anti-MBP-XlHSF1, 1:1000 for preimmune, 1:50 for affinity-purified anti-XlHSF1), and blots were incubated in the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After being washed with TBST, blots were incubated with secondary antibody (alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad)) diluted in 2% gelatin in TBST (1:2000 dilution) for 45 min at room temperature. Blots were then washed in TBST and developed for alkaline phosphatase activity using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt/nitro blue tetrazoluim chloride reagents as per manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The HSF·HSE complex was cut out of an EMSA gel and electroeluted in volatile buffer (50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) using the Bio-Rad model 422 Electro-Eluter. Electroelution was run at 10 mA/sample for 6 h. The induction of HSF1 in higher eukaryotes to a form that can activate hs gene transcription is thought to be a multistep process involving oligomerization, hyperphosphorylation, and other physical changes of HSF1. Some studies in mammalian cells have provided evidence that HSF1 activation is also accompanied by its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus suggesting that subcellular location could play an important role in the regulation of HSF1 activity (14Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that mammalian HSF1 is always a nuclear protein (24Wu C. Clos J. Giorgi G. Haroun R.I.

To further investigate the question of HSF1 localization, we have used another vertebrate, X. laevis. We have taken advantage of a specialized cell, the oocyte. Mature Xenopus oocytes are unusual in that they are extremely large cells (approximately 1–1.2 mm in diameter) and their nuclei, also known as germinal vesicles, can be physically dissected from the oocytes with little or no associated cytoplasm. Stage VI Xenopus oocytes have previously been shown to contain HSF1 DNA binding activity upon exposure to heat and chemical stress (28Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Development. 1990; 110: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar, 32Karn H. Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Gordon S. Bharadwaj S. Hnatov A. Ali A. Ovsenek N. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 47-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study, extracts from unshocked and heat-shocked oocytes, germinal vesicles, and the cytoplasmic portions of enucleated oocytes were assayed for HSF binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Germinal vesicles isolated under mineral oil have previously been shown to lose little or none of their nuclear contents, including proteins and small solutes, and be competent for transcription (30Paine P.L. Johnson M.E. Lau Y.-T. Tluczek L.J.M. Miller D.S. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar). We have also isolated germinal vesicles using traditional aqueous buffers. The former method minimizes any potential “leaching” of HSF1 into the cytoplasm during isolation and the latter method was employed to control for any potential artifacts that might be caused by mineral oil. Extracts made from germinal vesicles isolated from unshocked oocytes under oil (Fig.1 A) or with aqueous buffers (Fig.1 C) contained no HSF binding activity. However, in vitro heat shock treatments of germinal vesicles isolated from unshocked oocytes activated HSF1 DNA binding to levels comparable to that of intact shocked oocytes (Fig. 1, B and C). Optimal HSF1 binding activity in germinal vesicles isolated under oil was found to occur with a 33 °C heat shock, with 30 and 36 °C heat shocks producing lower levels of HSE·HSF1 complexes (Fig.1 A). This optimal induction temperature is the same as previously reported for whole oocytes (28Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Development. 1990; 110: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar). This result clearly demonstrates that HSF1 must have been present in the germinal vesicle prior to heat stress and that HSF1 was induced to maximum binding activity with an in vitro heat shock in the absence of cytoplasm. In vitro activation of HSF1 binding activity has previously been shown to occur in extracts made from unshocked human (36Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and Drosophila cells (12Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 37Zimarino V. Tsai C. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) extracts, but generally not with the same efficiency as an in vivo heat shock. 3J. T. Westwood, unpublished results. When enucleated unshocked oocytes were examined for HSF1 binding activity before and after an in vitro heat shock, none was observed (Fig. 1, B andC), suggesting that the cytoplasmic compartment may not contain HSF1. To determine whether the cytoplasm might contain factor(s) that facilitate the activation/deactivation of HSF1, we added cytoplasmic extract to isolated isolated germinal vesicles and heat-shocked them together in vitro. This combination did not produce any more activated HSF1 than when isolated germinal vesicles were heat-shocked in the absence of cytoplasm (Fig.1 C). To further examine the localization of HSF, we made antibodies against a maltose-binding protein-X. laevis HSF1 (MBP+XlHSF1) fusion protein in rabbits (Fig. 2 A). Crude and affinity-purified anti-XlHSF1 antisera were added to heat-shocked oocyte and Xenopus A6 cell extracts to determine if they could further retard (i.e. “supershift”) the HSF1·HSE complex in an EMSA assay. EMSA analysis of heat-shocked A6 cells revealed two distinguishable HSF·HSE complexes, whereas heat-shocked oocyctes produced a single complex (Fig. 2 B). Both the crude and affinity-purified anti-XlHSF1 antibodies supershifted the HSF·HSE complexes, whereas the preimmune sera had no effect on these complexes (Fig. 2 B). Unshocked or in vitro heat-shocked germinal vesicles (nuclei) were examined for HSF1 content by Western blot analysis, and a strong cross-reactive band was seen at 78 kDa (Fig. 3 A). This band was also observed in unshocked and heat-shocked whole oocytes but not in the cytoplasmic compartment of unshocked or heat-shocked enucleated oocytes (Fig.3 A). This result demonstrates that there is no, or virtually no, HSF1 in the cytoplasm prior to heat shock. Because a few other cross-reactive bands were detected in the oocyte extracts, we decided to further verify that the 78-kDa band was HSF1. HSF1·HSE complexes were excised from EMSA gels, the protein(s) electroeluted, and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-XlHSF1 antibodies. A band of 78 kDa was detected in proteins isolated from oocyte HSF·HSE complexes (Fig. 3 B). Three bands approximately 78, 74, and 67 kDa were observed in A6 cell complexes (Fig. 3 B). Although these sizes are all higher than the predicted size of XlHSF1 based on amino acid sequence (49.44 kDa) (34Stump D.G. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 160: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), similar discrepancies have also been shown for Drosophila (38Clos J. Westwood J.T. Becker P.B. Wilson S. Lambert K. Wu C. Cell. 1990; 63: 1085-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and human HSF1 (39Rabindran S.K. Giorgi G. Clos J. Wu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6906-6910Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and this discrepancy is likely due to the highly asymmetric shape of HSF (13Westwood J.T. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3481-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The 67-kDa HSF1 band we observe is the same size as reported for XlHSF1 translated from in vitro synthesized RNA in reticulocyte lysates or oocytes (34Stump D.G. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 160: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). All of the putative HSF1 bands we observe are lower than a size estimation of 88 kDa made from cross-linked XlHSF1/bromodeoxyuridine-labeled HSE complexes (28Ovsenek N. Heikkila J.J. Development. 1990; 110: 427-433PubMed Google Scholar). It appears possible that multiple isoforms or separate stress-inducible HSF exist in Xenopus A6 cells. Another possibility is that lower molecular weight bands represent stable degradation products of HSF1. Multiple HSF bands could arise from post-translational modification of a common HSF1 protein, differential splicing of HSF1 message, or the products of separate HSF genes. All three of these possibilities have been observed in other organisms (20Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E. Nature. 1988; 335: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 41Scharf K. Rose S. Zott W. Schoff F. Nover L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4495-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Goodson M.L. Sarge K.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Further studies will need to be done to clarify the number of stress-inducible HSFs and/or the nature of different HSF1 isoforms. The Western blotting experiments show that Xenopus HSF1 can be detected in oocytes and A6 cells using a polyclonal antibody made against a fusion protein containing the C-terminal portion of XlHSF1. Previous studies using antibodies against human HSF1 were unsuccessful in detecting the endogenous XlHSF1 in oocyte (34Stump D.G. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 160: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) orXenopus A6 cell extracts. 4P. A. Mercier and J. T. Westwood, unpublished results. The results presented here clearly show that X. laevis HSF1 is predominantly and perhaps even exclusively, a nuclear protein in mature oocytes before heat shock. Moreover, since inactive HSF1 is found in the nuclear compartment, we conclude nuclear localization is not dependent on post-translational modifications of HSF1 associated with its stress activation. Our results are consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that injection of XlHSF1 mRNA intoX. laevis oocytes resulted in accumulation of XlHSF1 in the germinal vesicle (nucleus) (34Stump D.G. Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 160: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 40Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In those studies, however, nuclear localization may have been a result of the oocytes being unable to regulate the activity of overexpressed HSF1. This interpretation is supported by in vivo footprinting experiments on exogenous hsp70 genes co-injected into oocytes, which showed that at least some of the overexpressed XlHSF1 must be in the trimeric form because it was bound to the HSEs at non-shock (18 °C) temperatures and would therefore be expected to be localized in the nucleus (40Landsberger N. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6013-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The detection of HSF1 in the nucleus of oocytes under both stress and non-stress conditions is entirely consistent with other studies showing that HSF1 is predominantly a nuclear protein at all times inDrosophila cells (12Westwood J.T.

Cell. 1995; 83: 29-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).2 However, these results are in contrast with other studies, which have proposed that HSF1 is predominantly a cytoplasmic protein in unshocked cells and is translocated to the nucleus after exposure to stress (14Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2486-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Further studies may be needed to clarify the localization of HSF1 in mammalian cells. Our finding that HSF1 is a nuclear protein prior to stress in oocytes has important implications for future studies aimed at elucidating the signaling pathways involved in HSF1 activation in response to stress. Previous studies have demonstrated that the endogenous HSF1 present in oocytes is capable of inducing the transcription of exogenous microinjected plasmids containing a hsp70 gene or a hs promoter-reporter gene construct after heat shock (44Voellmy R. Rungger D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 45Ananthan J. Goldberg A.L. Voellmy R. Science. 1986; 232: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 46Mifflin L.C. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15710-15717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that the endogenous HSF1 in oocytes can be activated to its transcriptionally active conformation once it has been exposed to heat or other forms of stress such as the introduction of abnormal proteins. The fact that XlHSF1 is present in the nucleus prior to stress means that the signals and/or factors, which serve to activate HSF1 and/or keep HSF1 in an inactive state must somehow reach or already be present in the nucleus. Indeed, Mifflin and Cohen (46Mifflin L.C. Cohen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15710-15717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that one inducer of the heat shock response, abnormal proteins, can only act as an inducer of hs gene transcription when they are injected directly into the nucleus. One of the central unanswered questions in the activation of hs genes by stress is whether HSF1 senses the various stress stimuli directly or if there may be one or more internal stress signals that serve to activate HSF1. In vitro activation of HSF1 binding in crude extracts (36Mosser D.D. Kotzbauer P.T. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3748-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 37Zimarino V. Tsai C. Wu C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2447-2450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 48Larson J.S. Schuetz T.J. Kingston R.E.

However, the fact the in vitro activation temperature of extracts is several degrees lower than the in vivo activation temperature and the fact the overexpression of HSF1 in cells usually results in the constitutive activation of HSF1 binding (15Sarge K.D.

Furthermore, it is not clear how other inducers, such as abnormal or denatured proteins, can act directly on HSF1. Based on the results of this study, we propose that HSF1 is responding to changing conditions in the nucleus and that whatever mechanisms are involved in HSF1 activation, they must be realized within the nucleus.

https://openalex.org/W2039096763,"We investigated the cis-acting elements and trans-acting proteins required for the transcriptional inhibition of the gonadotropin-releasing horomone (GnRH) gene by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in GT1–7 neurons. Transient transfection of GT1–7 neurons with the 5′-flanking region of the rat GnRH gene-luciferase fusion constructs revealed that a 53-base pair (bp) sequence between −126 and −73 bp is required for the hCG inhibition. Nuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons contained 110- and 95-kDa proteins that formed two complexes with the 53-bp sequence. These proteins are not related to Fos, cAMP response element-binding protein, Oct-1, or progesterone receptors, and hCG treatment selectively increased the 95-kDa protein. DNase I footprinting with GT1–7 cell nuclear extracts protected the −99 to −79-bp region, which contained a so-called imperfect AP-1 site (−99 to −94 bp) and two AT-rich palindromic sequences (−91 to −87 bp and −85 to −81 bp). The mutagenesis of the AT-rich regions, but not the AP-1 site, resulted in a loss of DNA binding of the 95-kDa protein and the inhibitory effect of hCG. In summary, our results are consistent with hCG inducing a 95-kDa trans-acting protein, which binds to −91- to −81-bp AT-rich sequences in the 5′-flanking region to inhibit the transcription of the GnRH gene.

The studies on the hypothalamic GnRH neurons are hampered by the fact that they are present in small numbers and harvesting them in quantities required for most studies is very difficult (5Liposits Z.

The development of immortalized GnRH-containing GT1–7 neurons by targeted oncogenesis has allowed investigators to make rapid advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis and release of GnRH (8Mellon P.L.

Res. 1991; 47: 69-96PubMed Google Scholar). One of these advances is that GT1–7 neurons have been shown to contain functional LH/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors (10Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mores N. Krsmanovic L.Z. Catt K.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5731-5734Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and these receptors are required for transcriptional inhibition of the GnRH gene by exogenous hCG in a dose- and time-dependent and hormone-specific manner (10Lei Z.M. Rao Ch.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). These findings supported the possible existence of a short loop feedback mechanism first proposed 30 years ago, in the synthesis and release of LH (12David M.A. Fraschini F. Martini L. Endocrinology. 1966; 78: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The treatment of GT1–7 neurons with hCG under the conditions that it inhibits GnRH synthesis, activated protein kinase A, increased the synthesis of new proteins, increased the levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Fos and c-Jun proteins, and decreased the levels of GnRH receptors (13Lei Z.M.

The present study focused on investigating the cis-acting elements and trans-acting proteins required for the transcriptional inhibition of the GnRH gene by hCG in GT1–7 neurons.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsThe following reagents were purchased from the indicated commercial sources: the promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2 basic DNA, luciferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and β-galactosidase assay systems, Klenow enzyme, restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase from Promega (Madison, WI); [14C]chloramphenicol and [32P]dATP from DuPont NEN; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, horse serum, antibiotic-antimycotic solution, Lipofectin reagent, and Opti-MEM I medium from Life Technologies, Inc.; Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit from U.

The oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in our laboratory using a solid oligonucleotide synthesizer (Gene Assembler Special, Pharmacia).Culture of NeuronsGT1–7 neurons were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum, 4.5 mg/ml glucose, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution in 150-cm2 flasks. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. When neurons reached 90% confluence, they were replated in 150-cm2 flasks for the isolation of nuclear proteins and in six-well plates for transient transfection experiments.Construction of CREB Expression VectorThe entire 1.2-kb coding region of CREB cDNA, including the 150-bp untranslated region at the 5′ end and the 50-bp untranslated region at the 3′ end in PGEM-37f(−) plasmid (15Gonzalez G.A. Yamamoto K.K. Fischer W.H. Karr D. Menzel P. Biggs III W. Vale W.W. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1989; 337: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), was released by digestion withEco RI and Bam HI. The DNA fragment was then subcloned into pCMV expression vector at the same sites.Promoter Reporter Fusion ConstructsRat GnRH promoter reporter fusion constructs were prepared as described previously (16Kepa J.K. Wang C. Neeley C.I. Raynolds M.V. Gordon D.F. Wood W.M. Wierman M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1393-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, we excised a Hin dIII fragment of the GnRH promoter region containing −3026 to +116 bp from pGEM7-GnRHP plasmid and subcloned into the Hin dIII site of the promoterless luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL2-basic) containing the coding region of luciferase gene. The sequential 5′ deletion constructs were prepared from the −3026- to +116-bp fragment using the convenient restriction sites. All the constructs have the same 3′ end at +116 bp. The sequence of each deletion construct was confirmed by multiple endonuclease restriction enzyme analyses.DNA TransfectionsGT1–7 neurons were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well cell culture plates and were grown to 60% confluence, then transfected by a liposome-based method. Cells were transfected with 30 μg of Lipofectin, 10 μg of wild type or mutated pGL2-GnRH promoter constructs or 3CRE/TK-CAT or 5TRE/TK-CAT, 2 μg of pCMV β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and 3 ml of Opti-MEM I per well. In some experiments, pCMV-CREB, pCMV-Fos, and pCMV-Jun expression plasmids were co-transfected at the same time.Measurement of Reporter Gene ActivitiesFor measurement of luciferase activity, the cells were lysed in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer from the Promega luciferase assay kit. Twenty μl of cell lysates were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay mixture (270 μm coenzyme A, 470 μm luciferin, and 530 μm ATP in 20 mm Tricine, 1.07 mm(MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2·5H2O, 2.67 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA disodium dihydrate, and 33.3 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 7.8)), and luciferase activity was immediately measured using a luminometer (model 20E, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA) at room temperature.For the CAT enzyme assay, 100 μl of cell lysates were preheated at 60 °C for 10 min and incubated with 25 μl of CAT enzyme assay mixture (0.15 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol, 25 μg ofn-butylryl coenzyme A) at 37 °C for 5 h. Ten μl of ethyl acetate extract were spotted onto thin layer chromatography plates and run for 1 h in a chloroform/methanol (97:3) mixture. The plates were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens for 5 days at −80 °C. After autoradiography, the butyrylated products were cut from the plates and counted in a liquid scintillation counter for determination of CAT activity.For measurement of β-galactosidase activity, 10 μl of cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 150 μl of 2 × β-galactosidase assay mixture (120 mmNa2HPO4, 80 mmNaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), and the absorbance at 420 nm was measured using a multiplate reader. The measurement of β-galactosidase activity served to monitor transfection efficiencies and also to normalize luciferase and CAT enzyme data for β-galactosidase activity.Preparation of Nuclear ExtractsNuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons were prepared essentially as described by Dignamet al. (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in homogenization buffer (0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm HEPES, 25 mm spermidine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 msucrose, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.6) and homogenized with a Dounce glass homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged to pellet nuclei. The crude nuclear pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.6). After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate (0.3 g/ml) was added to precipitate nuclear proteins from the supernatant and then dialyzed against 100 volumes of dialysis buffer (0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 25 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol, pH 7.6). The nuclear extracts were stored in aliquots at −80 °C.Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift AssayThe wild type or mutated DNA fragments from −126 to −73 bp of the GnRH promoter with 5′ overhangs were labeled by a fill-in reaction using [32P]dATP and Klenow enzyme. The labeled probes were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were performed as described in the BandShift kit from Pharmacia. Five-μg aliquots of the nuclear extracts from untreated and hCG- treated GT1–7 neurons were incubated with binding mixture (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 ng of labeled probe (30,000 cpm/reaction)) for 20 min at room temperature. For competition studies, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added to the binding mixture. For the electrophoretic gel mobility supershift experiments, polyclonal antibodies to phosphorylated CREB, c-Fos, c-Jun, Oct-1, and monoclonal antibody to progesterone were added to the binding mixture and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C prior to adding the probes. After incubation, DNA-protein complexes were resolved by 4% native PAGE in buffer containing 7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mmsodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 5 h. Gels were dried and exposed overnight at −80 °C to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens.Southwestern BlotThe proteins in 100-μg aliquots of nuclear extracts were separated by 8% discontinuous SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions, then electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. The proteins were renatured by placing the membranes in Z′ buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 μmZnSO4, and 100 mm NaCl) containing 6m guanidinium chloride. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by Z′ buffer containing 3% nonfat dried milk (18Jackson S.T. Gene Transcription: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993: 189-242Google Scholar). Finally, the membranes were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with binding buffer (Z′ buffer plus 5 μg of poly(dI-dC), 30 μg of calf thymus DNA, and 1 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled probe (−126- to −73-bp DNA fragment of the GnRH promoter, wild type, or mutated −126- to +116-bp DNA fragment of the GnRH promoter) per ml). In competition studies, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added to the binding buffer. After washing three times with Z′ buffer, the membranes were exposed at −80 °C for 2 days to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens.DNase I FootprintingThe one end 32P-labeled DNA fragments as probes were prepared as follows. For the coding strand, the −1031 to +116 bp of the GnRH gene 5′-flanking region in pGL2 vector was digested with Pvu II and Hin dIII to release a −126- to +116-bp DNA fragment with a 5′ overhang only in one end (Hin dIII site) for fill-in labeling; for the noncoding strand, the same vector was first digested withEco RI to generate a DNA fragment for fill-in labeling. Both end-labeled DNA fragments were then digested with Dra I. The −171- to −16-bp DNA fragment with only one end labeled was purified by PAGE. DNase I footprinting assays were performed as described in the SureTrack footprinting kit from Pharmacia. The nuclear extracts (0–60 μg of protein as indicated in the figure legends) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with a binding mixture (10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 20,000 cpm of labeled probe), then 0.5 mm CaCl2 and 2 mmMgCl2 were added, and the mixture was digested with 0.8 unit of DNase I for exactly 1 min. The reactions were terminated by adding stop solution (192 mm sodium acetate, 32 mm EDTA, 0.14% SDS, and 64 μg/ml yeast RNA), extracted with phenol/chloroform, and analyzed on an 8% polyacrylamide, 42% urea sequencing gel. Then the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screens for 2 days at −80 °C. A Maxam and Gilbert G + A reaction was also performed on the same probes and run as a marker for the footprint reactions.Site-directed MutagenesisThe site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (19Blacklow S.C. Knowles J.R. Directed Mutagenesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1991: 177-198Google Scholar). Briefly, the 5′-flanking region of the GnRH gene was subcloned into pBluescript II KS+ vector and transfected into a dut nug mutant E. coli RZ1032 to generate single-stranded plasmid DNA. The single-stranded plasmid DNA was annealed with oligonucleotides containing the mutated sequences followed by in vitro DNA synthesis to produce double-stranded plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA was transfected into competent cells, E. coli JM109. The mutants were identified by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing with M13 universal primers. The mutated 5′-flanking regions of the GnRH gene were subcloned into promoterless luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic for functional studies.Repetition of Experiments and Statistical AnalysesEach experiment was performed in duplicate. All the experiments were repeated at least three times on different occasions. The data presented are the means and S.E. of all the values. One-way analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test were used for statistical analyses of the data (20Steel R.G.D. Torrie J.H. Principles and Procedures of Statistics, with Special Reference to the Biological Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1960: 99-128Google Scholar).RESULTSAnalyses of Promoter Activity of the GnRH GeneTo determine the transcriptional regulation of the GnRH gene by hCG and the common transcription factors such as Fos, Jun, and CREB, we placed the 5′-flanking region of the GnRH gene from −3026 to +116 bp in front of the coding region of the luciferase gene and transiently transfected it into GT1–7 neurons. Transfected GT1–7 neurons robustly expressed the promoter activity of the GnRH gene. Treatment of these neurons under optimal conditions (100 ng/ml hCG and 12 h) resulted in a significant decrease in the promoter activity (Fig. 1). Co-transfections with increasing amounts of Fos or CREB expression vectors also resulted in a dose-dependent significant decrease in the promoter activity of the GnRH gene (Fig. 1). Similar co-transfection with Jun expression vector, on the other hand, had no effect on its own nor could it modify the inhibition conferred by Fos or CREB (Fig. 1). The CREB was more effective than Fos, while Fos was similar to hCG in inhibiting the promoter activity. There was no synergism between CREB and Fos or between CREB, Fos, and Jun when they were simultaneously co-transfected (Fig. 1).We prepared next a series of deletion constructs to determine what regions of the 5′-flanking sequence are required for the inhibition of promoter activity of the GnRH gene by hCG, CREB, and Fos. The basal activity shown in Fig. 2 demonstrates that deletion of the upstream sequence from −1031 bp resulted in a 71% decrease, and further deletions to the −16-bp position resulted in a greater than 95% decrease in the promoter activity of the GnRH gene (Fig. 2). These data are consistent with the presence of major activation and neuron-specific enhancer regions at the upstream sequence from −1031 bp (16Kepa J.K. Wang C. Neeley C.I. Raynolds M.V. Gordon D.F.

Asterisks indicate significant differences as compared with the luciferase activity in the full-length construct.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)After establishing the sequence requirements for basal promoter activity, we treated the transfected GT1–7 neurons with hCG or co-transfected them with Fos and CREB expression vectors and then measured luciferase activity. Despite the decrease in basal activity, the deletion of sequences up to the −126-bp position had no effect on the ability of hCG, CREB, or Fos to inhibit the promoter activity of the GnRH gene (Fig. 3). Deletion to the −73-bp position resulted in a complete loss of hCG and Fos inhibition and partial loss of CREB inhibition. Further deletion to the −16-bp position resulted in an even greater loss of CREB effect (Fig. 3).Figure 3Effect of treatment with hCG or overexpression of Fos or CREB on promoter activity in deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the GnRH gene in GT1–7 neurons. The cells were transfected with various deletion constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the GnRH gene and also with pCMV-Fos and pCMV-CREB. For the reason indicated in Fig. 1 legend, the untreated and hCG-treated cells were also co-transfected with pCMV expression vector without a cDNA insert. The luciferase activity was measured 36 h after transfection or 12 h after treatment with 100 ng/ml hCG commenced 36 h after transfection. The basal luciferase activity in corresponding deletion constructs was considered 100%. Asterisks indicate significant differences compared with the corresponding controls at p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether inhibitory effects of hCG, Fos, and CREB are specific to the GnRH promoter, we transfected GT1–7 neurons with expression vectors containing three copies of the canonical CRE or five copies of human metallothionein 11A TRE linked upstream of HSV TK promoter and the CAT structural gene (24Quinn P.G.

Cell. 1988; 54: 553-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The cells were also co-transfected with either pCMV-CREB, pCMV-Fos, or pCMV-Jun, or combinations of them, or treated with 100 ng/ml hCG for 12 h. As shown in Fig. 4, co-transfection with pCMV-CREB resulted in an increase rather than a decrease in CRE/TK-CAT activity. Counting the radioactivity in the butyrylated product revealed that CAT activity was increased 5.8-fold by CREB. Co-transfection with pCMV-Fos or pCMV-Jun resulted in a similar 4.8-fold increase in TRE/TK-CAT activity.Figure 4The thin layer chromatography results of a representative experiment showing stimulation of CRE and TRE activity following co-transfection with indicated expression vectors or after treatment of GT1–7 neurons with hCG. The cells were transfected with CRE/TK-CAT or TRE/TK-CAT and also with pCMV-CREB, pCMV-Fos, pCMV-Jun as indicated. The CAT activity was measured in whole cell extracts 72 h after transfection or 12 h after treatment with 100 ng/ml hCG commenced 72 h after transfection. The fold changes were calculated from the counts/min in the butyrylated product. The values in CRE/TK-CAT- and TRE/TK-CAT-transfected cells were set at 1 for calculating the fold changes in the others. bu-Cm, butyrylated chloramphenicol; Cm, chloramphenicol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Co-transfection with both pCMV-Fos and pCMV-Jun resulted in a 7.1-fold increase in TRE/TK-CAT activity. Treatment of CRE/TK-CAT and TRE/TK-CAT transfected GT1–7 neurons with hCG resulted in a 5.8- and 3.7-fold increase in CAT activity, respectively. These increases, plus the fact that Jun can increase TRE/TK-CAT activity in the absence of any effect on the promoter of the GnRH gene, would suggest that the inhibitory effects of hCG, Fos, and CREB are indeed specific to GnRH promoter.Specific Binding of Nuclear Proteins to the Promoter Region of the GnRH GeneSince the inhibition of promoter activity of the GnRH gene by hCG requires the −126- to −73-bp region of the 5′-flanking sequence (Fig. 3), we used this DNA fragment for electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays to identify and characterize the nuclear proteins from GT1–7 neurons. As shown in Fig. 5, nuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons formed three complexes with distinct electrophoretic mobilities. These complexes were designated as C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 5). The formation of C1 and C2 but not the C3 complex was inhibited by the addition of 100-fold excess corresponding unlabeled DNA fragment, suggesting that the C3 complex is nonspecific (Fig. 5). Calf thymus DNA had no effect on the formation of any of the three complexes (Fig. 5). Using equal amounts of nuclear extracts, the GT1–7 neurons treated with 100 ng/ml hCG showed an increase in the C2 complex at 12 h followed by a decline to the control level by 24 h (Fig. 5).Figure 5Electrophoretic gel mobility shift following the incubation of the 32P-labeled −123- to −74-bp 5′-flanking region of the GnRH gene with nuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons treated with or without 100 ng/ml hCG for 9, 12, and 24 h. One hundred-fold molar excess of unlabeled −123- to −74-bp GnRH 5′-flanking region (specific) or calf thymus DNA (nonspecific) was used in the competition experiments.

In this assay, nuclear extracts from hCG-treated GT1–7 neurons were preincubated with the polyclonal antibodies to the above transcription factors, and the assays were performed. The results showed that none of the antibodies was able to induce supershifts (data not shown). To determine whether the assay is sensitive enough for detection of supershifts, we performed a procedural control in which Oct-1 antibody was added to the nuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons and then performed the assay with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus ectomere sequence. The results showed that Oct-1 antibody had indeed caused a supershift (data not shown).To further characterize the nuclear proteins from GT1–7 neurons that bound to the −126- to −73-bp region of the 5′-flanking sequence of the GnRH gene, we performed Southwestern blotting. In this assay, the proteins in nuclear extracts from GT1–7 neurons were resolved by PAGE under reducing conditions, then transferred to membranes and probed with 32P-labeled −126- to −73-bp DNA fragment. Fig.6 shows that 110- and 95-kDa proteins bind to the DNA fragment (lane 1). The addition of excess unlabeled corresponding DNA fragment resulted in an inhibition of binding of both the proteins (lane 5).

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of photolabeled cartilage microsomes, which are specialized in chondroitin sulfate synthesis, showed a major radiolabeled band at 80 kDa and other minor radiolabeled bands near 40 and 60 kDa. Rat liver microsomes, which are enriched for enzymes of detoxification by glucuronidation, had a different pattern with multiple major labeled bands near 50–60 and 35 kDa. To determine that the photolabeled 80-kDa protein is the GlcA transferase II, we have purified the enzyme from cartilage microsomes. This membrane-bound enzyme, involved in the transfer of GlcA residues to non-reducing terminal GalNAc residues of the chondroitin polymer, has now been solubilized, stabilized, and then purified greater than 1350-fold by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and WGA-agarose. The purified enzyme exhibited a conspicuous silver-stained protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that coincided with the major radiolabeled band of 80 kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis of photoaffinity-labeled active fractions from the Q-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and WGA-agarose also indicated only the single radiolabeled band at 80 kDa. Intensity of photolabeling in each of the fractions examined coincided with enzyme activity. The photolabeling of this 80-kDa protein was saturable with the photoprobe and could be inhibited by the addition of UDP-GlcA prior to the addition of the photoprobe. Thus, the photolabeling with [β-32P]5-azido-UDP-GlcA has identified the GlcA transferase II as an 80-kDa protein. The purified enzyme was capable of transferring good amounts of GlcA residues to chondroitin-derived pentasaccharide with negligible transfer to pentasaccharides derived from hyaluronan or heparan.

Proteochondroitin sulfate consists of a wide range of core protein families with covalently attached chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains (1Wight T.N. Heinegard D.K. Hascall V.C. Hay E.D. Cell Biology of Extracellular Matrix. Plenum Press, New York1991: 45-78Crossref Google Scholar). Formation of chondroitin sulfate is initiated by xylosylation of appropriate serine residues in the core protein followed by the addition of two Gal residues, a GlcA residue and a GalNAc residue. The GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl portion of the linkage is common to all glycosaminoglycans with the exception of keratan sulfate. Addition of the first GalNAc residue commits the polysaccharide to be a galactosaminoglycan (chondroitin), with subsequent alternating addition of GlcA and GalNAc residues resulting in the formation of the chondroitin polymer (2Rodén L.

The overall sequence of reactions has been well characterized, with each of the sugar transfers catalyzed by a separate glycosyltransferase (2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J.

The fine structure of chondroitin sulfate appears to be controlled by the membrane topography at the site of synthesis together with the concerted interaction of different glycosyl transferases and sulfotransferases in juxtaposition to the membrane-bound nascent proteoglycan (3Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate parallels that of heparin/heparan sulfate in many respects. While the only chondroitin sulfate-synthesizing enzymes as yet purified are the xylosyl transferase (10Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 37: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (11Habuchi O. Matsui Y. Kotoya Y. Aoyama Y. Yasuda Y. Noda M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, some of these have been shown to be multifunctional, so that a single protein has been shown to contain two separate enzyme activities (15Wlad H. Maccarana M. Eriksson I. Kjellen L. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24538-24541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol.

The presence of such multifunctional proteins in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis has not yet been investigated due to the lack of purified enzymes. We and others have previously utilized chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage microsomes together with labeled UDP-GlcA, UDP-GalNAc, and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate to examine chondroitin sulfate synthesis (2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar, 3Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys.

Similar microsomal preparations have been used to transfer [14C]GlcA from UDP-[14C]GlcA to chondroitin oligosaccharides containing non-reducing GalNAc residues (23Silbert J.E. Reppucci Jr., A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3942-3947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Gundlach M.W. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), thus providing a useful method for measuring the GlcA transferase activity. In addition, these microsomal preparations have been shown to contain GlcA transferase activity for adding GlcA to non-reducing terminal Gal residues such as that found in the Gal-Gal-Xyl linkage region (25Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brandt A.E. Distler J. Jourdian G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 64: 374-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mixed substrate experiments have indicated that the transfers of [14C]GlcA to the linkage oligosaccharide and to chondroitin oligosaccharide are each catalyzed by separate enzymes (25Helting T. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 2799-2805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which have been termed GlcA transferase I and GlcA transferase II (2Rodén L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Press, New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar). Attempts to purify and characterize the membrane-associated chondroitin glycosyl transferases have previously not been successful due to low copy numbers and an inherent instability after solubilization. We have now been able to stabilize the GlcA transferase II during a 1350-fold purification from chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage microsomes. Silver staining of the purified enzyme preparation demonstrated a prominent band at 80 kDa as well as other minor additional bands. To aid in the purification and identification of the enzyme, we have used a UDP-GlcA analog, [β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA, *This research was supported by the Veterans Affairs Medical Research Service, by National Institutes of Health Grant AR-41649 (to G.

Zimniak P. Haley B.E. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23257-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This analog contains base-substituted azido groups, which upon UV irradiation form highly reactive nitrene intermediates, which in turn form covalent bonds with amino acids at the sugar nucleotide binding site. By this technique, we found that GlcA transferase II is the 80-kDa protein seen on the silver-stained gel. UDP-[U-14C]GlcA was purchased from DuPont NEN. Non-radioactive UDP-GlcA, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin)-agarose, and GlcNAc were purchased from Sigma. Heparin-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Chondroitin and chondroitin pentasaccharide were prepared as described previously (28Sugumaran G. Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 382-427Google Scholar). Hyaluronan pentasaccharide was prepared by degradation of hyaluronan withStreptomyces hyaluronidase to obtain a hexasaccharide, followed by removal of the unsaturated uronic acid with mercuric acetate (29Ludwigs U. Elgavish A. Esko J.D. Meezan E. Rodén L. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Heparan pentasaccharide was obtained fromEscherichia coli K5 heparan polysaccharide (30Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) by partial degradation with heparitinase to obtain a hexasaccharide, followed by removal of the unsaturated uronic acid with mercuric acetate. Reaction mixtures contained 0.05 m MES buffer; pH 6.5, 0.015 m MnCl2; 0.05% Triton X-100; 0.07 mm UDP-[14C]GlcA (325 mCi/mmol); 5–60 μg of chondroitin pentasaccharide, hyaluronan pentasaccharide, or heparan pentasaccharide; and 12 μl of microsomal fraction or enzyme fraction in a total volume of 15 μl. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman no. 1 paper and chromatographed in butanol:acetic acid:1 mNH4OH (2:3:1) for 48 h. The origins were eluted with water and counted. All operations were carried out at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Epiphyseal cartilage from tibias and femurs of 400 17-day-old-chick embryos were suspended in 150 ml of 0.25 m sucrose containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm N-ethyl maleimide, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin) and homogenized with a Polytron tissue grinder at maximum setting by five 30-s bursts separated by 1 min intervals. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellet was rehomogenized as described above after suspension in 100 ml of 0.25 msucrose containing protease inhibitors. The second homogenate was also centrifuged at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant obtained was combined with the first. The pooled 12,000 ×g supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 ×g for 90 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge. The pellets obtained were used in further purification. The microsomal pellets obtained were suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmDTT, 20% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). To this suspension an equal volume of buffer B (buffer A containing 2% Triton X-100) was added. The suspension was gently mixed for 60 min and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was saved, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer A. An equal volume of buffer B containing 2.0 m NaCl was added. After incubation for 60 min with gentle mixing, the suspension was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was combined with the first supernatant and used as the solubilized enzyme. By this two-step procedure, we were able to solubilize almost 90% of the GlcA transferase II activity from the membranes. After adjusting the NaCl concentration to 0.05 m, the solubilized enzyme was applied on to a 1.5 × 14-cm Q-Sepharose column that was previously equilibrated with buffer C (buffer A containing only 0.02% Triton X-100) plus 0.05 m NaCl. The column was then washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient of 0.05–1.0 m in buffer C. Fractions of 3.0 ml were collected and assayed for GlcA transferase II activity. Fractions containing the activity were combined and diluted with buffer C to adjust the NaCl concentration to 0.15 mand used for the next step. The active enzyme from Step 3 was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (1.5 × 20 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.15m NaCl. The column was then washed with five volumes of the same buffer. The bound enzyme was eluted with buffer C containing 1.0m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer C containing 0.15 m NaCl. The dialyzed enzyme from the previous step was mixed for 3 h with 10 ml of WGA-agarose in a sealed column that was equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.15m NaCl. After this period, the column was washed with 10 column volumes of the same buffer. Bound proteins were then eluted from the column with buffer C containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5m GlcNAc. Fractions containing the enzyme activity were pooled and used further. At each stage of purification, active fractions were examined by silver staining of 10% SDS gels. The photoaffinity probe [β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA was synthesized as described previously (31Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Mixtures (60 μl) containing 0.2–50 μg of enzyme protein in 0.05m MES buffer, pH 6.5, 0.015 mMnCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, plus 100 μm[β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA were irradiated at room temperature with a hand-held UV lamp for 90 s. Reaction mixtures that contained heat-inactivated enzyme and reaction mixtures that were not UV-irradiated served as controls. For competition experiments, the appropriate competing ligand was included in the same mixture. In other reactions, chick cartilage microsomes were replaced with rat liver microsomes. Photolabeling was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (31Radominska A. Drake R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Photoincorporation was visualized by autoradiography of the stained SDS-PAGE gels. The relative amount of photoincorporation was determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram. An autoradiogram of chick cartilage microsomes and rat liver microsomes photolabeled with [β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA is shown in Fig.1. Lane 1, consisting of the addition of the32P-labeled probe to cartilage microsomes but without UV irradiation, gave a single radiolabeled band around 72 kDa. This labeling is apparently of a nonspecific nature and is due to the presence of minor contaminants in the probe. Following UV irradiation (lane 2), a much more prominently labeled band at approximately 80 kDa and another band at 40 kDa were seen. This labeling was essentially eliminated when 0.16 mm UDP-GlcA was added before addition of the photoprobe (lane 3). Rat liver microsomes (lane 4), which are enriched for the enzymes of GlcA conjugation for detoxification, demonstrated multiple bands at 50–60 kDa (previously shown to be involved in glucuronidation; Ref. 27Drake R.R. Zimniak P. Haley B.E. Lester R. Elbein A.D. Radominska A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23257-23260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at 35–37 kDa (previously shown to be a Glc-P-dolichol synthase; Refs. 27Drake R.R. Zimniak P. Haley B.E. Lester R.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14105-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional faint photolabeled bands at approximately 70 kDa and at 80 kDa (the same position as the strongest photolabeled cartilage microsomal band), were also seen. It is of note that cartilage microsomes had no labeled bands near 50–60 kDa, consistent with their inability to transfer [14C]GlcA from UDP-[14C]GlcA to acceptors such as phenolphthalein (detoxification) (23Silbert J.E. Reppucci Jr., A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3942-3947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As with the cartilage microsomes, photoincorporation into rat liver microsomal protein was also inhibited by inclusion of UDP-GlcA during the labeling (lane 5), indicating that the photoprobe was specifically labeling the proteins that utilize UDP-GlcA. All incorporation of label was dependent on UV irradiation. We then purified the GlcA transferase II activity from the chick cartilage microsomes using chondroitin pentasaccharide as acceptor and photolabeling to provide an additional monitor during the different steps of purification. Approximately 90% of the microsomally bound GlcA transferase II could be solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 and NaCl in the presence of 20% glycerol and 1 mm DTT as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Under these conditions the enzyme could be stored for 1 year at −20 °C without any appreciable loss in activity. However, when the glycerol and DTT were omitted, all activity was lost within a few days. Therefore, all purification procedures were carried out in the presence of these ingredients. Elution of the solubilized GlcA transferase II from a Q-Sepharose column provided two peaks (Fig. 2). The second of these peaks, containing approximately 60% of the GlcA transferase II activity, had no GlcA transferase I activity and was used for further purification. Active enzyme from the Q-Sepharose step was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column and was eluted as a sharp peak with 1.0m NaCl (Fig. 3). After removal of NaCl by dialysis, the enzyme was mixed with WGA-agarose in a sealed column for 3 h. Under these conditions all the enzyme activity bound to WGA-agarose and was eluted with buffer C to which 0.5 mGlcNAc and 0.15 m NaCl were added (Fig. 4). Attempts to purify the enzyme beyond this step were unsuccessful due to the extremely low amounts of protein present and the inability of this enzyme to bind to various affinity ligands such as Sepharose or agarose linked to UDP-GlcA or UDP-hexanolamine, which have been used by others for binding other glycosyl transferases (18Lind T.

Microsomes obtained from the epiphyseal cartilage of 400 chicken embryos were utilized.

The protein content after the final WGA-agarose step (Fig. 4) was estimated to approximate a 1350-fold purification of the GlcA transferase II activity with ∼24% recovery (Table I). However, the amount of protein at this final step was too low to provide an accurate measurement of purification. SDS-PAGE of the individual fractions eluted from the final WGA-agarose step exhibited several protein bands on silver staining with a major band around 80 kDa (Fig.5).Table IPurification of GlcA transferase IIPurification stepTotal protein1-aDetermined by the Bio-Rad protein assay.Total activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymg14C cpm × 10614C cpm × 106/mg protein-fold%Microsomes1451320.911100Solubilized microsomes621201.92.191Q-Sepharose (Peak II)8.2809.751160Heparin-Sepharose0.356518520340WGA-agarose<0.025321230>1350241-a Determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. Open table in a new tab At each step of purification, peak fractions and nearby fractions were photolabeled and electrophoretically separated on 10% SDS gels (Fig.6). Panel A1 is an autoradiogram of photoaffinity-labeled microsomes, and panel A2 is one of photoaffinity-labeled solubilized microsomes. Each of these demonstrated a major band at 80 kDa and other faint bands at 40 and 50 kDa. Electrophoresis of the photolabeled fractions from the second peak of the Q-Sepharose column (Fig. 2) is shown in panel B. Only a single, distinct labeled band at 80 kDa was present, while the minor labeled bands at 40 and 50 kDa seen in panel A were no longer present. However, both 80- and 40-kDa labeled bands were seen when fractions from the first Q-Sepharose peak (Fig. 2) were analyzed (data not shown). Intensity of the 80-kDa photolabeled protein was strongest in the fraction that contained the maximum enzyme activity. Enzyme activity in each analyzed fraction from heparin-Sepharose (panel C) and WGA-agarose (panel D) also coincided in intensity of photolabeling with a single band at 80 kDa. There was no labeling observed when the enzyme was heat-inactivated (data not shown). Pentasaccharide together with varying concentrations of UDP-[14C]GlcA were incubated with pooled fractions from the second peak of the Q-Sepharose column (Fig. 2) as shown in Fig.7. Varying concentrations of [β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA were added to similar enzyme and exposed to UV light as described for photolabeling under “Experimental Procedures.” Results using densitometry to quantitate the bands are shown in Fig. 7. We found that the enzyme was saturable with both UDP-[14C]GlcA and [β-32P]5-N3UDP-GlcA at similar concentrations with an apparent Km for UDP-GlcA and an apparent Kd for the probe at 5 × 10−5m. Purified enzyme eluted from the WGA-agarose column was incubated with UDP[14C]GlcA plus pentasaccharides prepared from heparan (E. coli K5) and hyaluronan (Table II). There was no incorporation of GlcA into either pentasaccharide, demonstrating that the purified GlcA transferase II was specific for chondroitin synthesis. In contrast, rat liver microsomes had activity in transferring GlcA to the heparan and hyaluronan pentasaccharides, as well as to chondroitin pentasaccharide, demonstrating that each pentasaccharide substrate was an acceptor when appropriate enzymes were present.Table IISpecificity of purified GlcA transferase IIPentasaccharide derived from[14C]GlcA incorporatedChondroitinHyaluronanHeparan (E. coli K5)WGA-agarose+−−8000−+−380−−+100Rat liver microsome control+−−3500−+−1150−−+5300 Open table in a new tab Previous work on chondroitin biosynthesis by chick embryo epiphyseal cartilage microsomes indicated that the glycosyl transferases are firmly bound to the microsomal membranes with nascent proteochondroitin substrate at the site of synthesis (3Silbert J.E. Sugumaran G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast, soluble heparin-synthesizing glycosyl transferases have been found to be present in good quantity in commercial serum sources (18Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We were unable to find such an alternative source for soluble GlcA transferase II. Recently, it was reported that the GlcA transferase II activity in serum was developmentally regulated with the activity being the highest at the mid prenatal stage in chicken and bovine sera and at the late prenatal stage in rat serum (37Kitagawa H. Ujikawa M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6583-6585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The activity declined rapidly after this stage in all three species. It is possible that the commercial serum sources that we examined were at later developmental stages so that the GlcA transferase II activity had already declined. Although GlcA transferase II has previously been solubilized from microsomes using an alkali detergent method or Nonidet P-40 and KCl (38Schwartz N.B. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5200-5207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that such activity was lost rapidly, precluding further purification. Therefore, we have used Triton X-100 and NaCl in the presence of 20% glycerol and DTT to solubilize and stabilize the enzyme activity. With this modification, the purified enzyme stored at −20 °C retained full activity for at least 1 year. We were able to monitor protein content in the purification through the heparin-Sepharose step (Fig. 3, Table I). However as mentioned previously, protein content after the final WGA-agarose step (Fig. 4) was too low to provide an accurate measurement of purification. Therefore, we believe that the purification is actually higher than 1350-fold. Attempts to purify the enzyme beyond this step were unsuccessful, but photoaffinity labeling provided an alternative approach. Similar photoaffinity labeling has been useful in characterizing other difficult to purify glycosyl transferases (32Drake R.R. Palamarcyzk G. Haley B.E. Lennarz W.J. Biosci. Rep. 1990; 10: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar,33Shailubhai K. Illeperuma C. Tayal M. Vijay I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14105-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-match of the intensity of the photolabeled protein (Fig. 6) with the peaks of enzyme activity eluted from Q-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and WGA-agarose (Figs. 2, 3, 4) and the incapability of the purified enzyme to transfer [14C]GlcA to pentasaccharides other than chondroitin pentasaccharide (Table II), indicate that the 80-kDa protein is the GlcA transferase II. Moreover, the Km value for UDP-GlcA and theKd for the photoprobe were essentially identical (Fig. 7), demonstrating that the photoprobe can substitute for UDP-GlcA with approximately the same efficiency of binding at the substrate binding site. A similar apparent Km for UDP-GlcA was previously reported with intact microsomes (39Sugumaran G. Pisoni R.L. Silbert J.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 151: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). It was of particular interest that the Km for UDP-GlcA did not change with solubilization, suggesting that transport of UDP-GlcA into the lumen of these microsomes was not a limiting factor in biosynthesis. The 1350-fold purified GlcA transferase II had no GlcA transferase I activity (data not presented), thus confirming that the two activities are independent. However, it is possible that the lower photolabeled band seen at 40 kDa in the chondroitin-synthesizing cartilage microsomes (Fig. 1) may represent the GlcA transferase I. We thank Dr. J. E. Silbert, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bedford and Harvard Medical School, Boston, for valuable comments and constant encouragement.

The initial approach to that problem involved the construction of a strain of A. vinelandii, designated LM100, that had a disruption of the fdxA gene that encodes FdI (11Morgan T.V. Lundell D.J.

Lundell D.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

The protein was shown to be a Mr ∼29,000 NADPH-ferredoxin reductase that was designated FPR because its physical properties and amino acid sequence showed striking similarity to the FPR from Escherichia coli (21Isas J.M.

The Luciferase assay system and Primer Extension system were purchased from Promega. The Sequenase kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp.. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Company. All chemicals used were of reagent or molecular biology grade. The E. coli strains DH1 (F−gyrA96 recA1 relA1 endA1 thi-1 hsdR17 supE44 λ −) and C600 (thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 lac1 tonA21 supE44 λ −) were used as host cells for plasmids.

All E. coli strains were grown on Luria-Bertani medium at 37 °C with 300 rpm agitation. All A. vinelandii strains were grown in 100 ml of Burk's medium, at 30 °C and 200 rpm agitation.

The vector pXLM7 was constructed by the same strategy as for pXLuc9, except the PCR fragment was mutagenized using the following oligonucleotides and methods described in PCR Protocols (24Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H.

The RNA was then LiCl2 precipitated two times to remove impurities and then quantified, and the purity was evaluated using UV-visible spectroscopy. The RNA was then denatured with deionized formamide and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and EtBr and then transferred and fixed to Hybond-N+ as described elsewhere (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 466-467Google Scholar).

A synthetic oligonucleotide (ggtatcgttccagtgatgaacactgaggac) complementary to the sequence spanning the fpr start codon was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to whole cell RNA fromAv OP and LM100 strains. The labeled probe was extended using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. Reagents were obtained as part of the AMVRT Primer extension system (Promega), and the reactions were carried out according to protocols therein. The resulting cDNA was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The parallel dideoxy sequencing reaction was carried out using the same unlabeled oligonucleotide, pS-XF1.5Sal (21Isas J.M. Yannone S.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

Aliquots of the resulting fragments were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Cell extracts were prepared by growing 100-ml cultures on Burk's with ammonia at 30 °C and 200 rpm to mid-log phase. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5 K for 10 min using a Sorvall SS-34 rotor, washed in 10 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, resuspended in 2 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and sonicated on ice. The sonicate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, transferred to a new tube, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The DNA binding reactions (10 μl) contained 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI)-poly(dC), 0.005m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, approximately 0.5–1.0 fmol of labeled DNA, and 1–5 μl of cell extract. The reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then electrophoresed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacryamide gel at 4 °C for approximately 1.5 h as described elsewhere (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 5.0.3-5.10.2Google Scholar). The gel was fixed on Whatman #1 paper and exposed to Kodak XAR film for approximately 12 h. Cell extracts were prepared by centrifuging 1.5 ml of a log phase growing culture for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, aspirating off the medium, adding 800 μl of sonication buffer, (10% glycerol, 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA), sonicating on ice and microcentrifuging at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube and stored at −20 °C. Extracts were thawed at 25 °C, and 20-μl aliquots were used to assay for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system from Promega, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Ten second measurements were taken on the Monolight 2010 luminometer from Analytical Luminescence Laboratory. In previous studies we have shown that FPR protein levels are greatly increased in FdI− strain LM100 relative to the wild type A. vinelandii strain (11Morgan T.V. Lundell D.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1370-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Isas J.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19404-19409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Isas J.M.

Dean D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3162-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if the increase of FPR was reflected in the fpr m RNA, total cell RNA was isolated from wild type A. vinelandii and from the FdI− strain LM100, and Northern analyses were performed using a 1.2-kb DNA fragment that included the entire fpr open reading frame as a probe. Two conclusions can be drawn from these data, which are shown in Fig. 1. First, the levels offpr mRNA are greatly increased in the FdI−strain LM100, indicating that the fpr gene is not regulated solely at the level of translation and/or protein stabilization. Rather, the increase in FPR appears to be due to regulation at the level of the fpr transcript. Second, only one major transcript was observed, which was approximately 900 nucleotides in length from both wild type A. vinelandii and from the FdI− strain LM100 (Fig. 1). A message of this length is only consistent with a monocistronic message originating at a promoter proximal to the open reading frame. To identify the specific start site for transcription, a series of primer extension experiments were carried out. A 30-bp oligonucleotide primer that was complementary to the region of the fpr m RNA overlapping the region encoding the first seven amino acids of FPR was used. The radiolabeled primer was annealed to an A. vinelandii total RNA preparation and extended using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. To determine the exact size of the product of that reaction the same oligonucleotide primer was used to sequence a DNA template containing the entire fpr clone (21Isas J.M. Yannone S.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21258-21263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) including 450 bp upstream of thefpr coding region. As shown in Fig. 2 those data clearly identified the start site for transcription as the adenosine noted in Fig. 3. It should also be noted that the same transcriptional start site was identified for both wild type and FdI− LM100 strains of A. vinelandii, indicating that the same promoter is initiating transcription in both cases. Inspection of the sequence immediately upstream of this start site revealed a canonical ς 70-type promoter (Fig. 3). The identified ς 70 promoter has the typical 7 bp spacing between the +1 adenosine start site and the Pribnow box, which has only a single deviation from the consensus at a highly variant position (noted in bold type in Fig. 3). The spacing between the Pribnow box and the −35 hexamer is the typical 17 bp; the −35 consensus also has only a single deviation from the consensus. It should be noted that the identification of the nearly ideal ς 70 promoter confirms our earlier conclusion (21Isas J.M. Yannone S.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21258-21263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that FPR is encoded by a non-nif gene.Figure 3Sequence and restriction sites of thefpr promoter.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), FPR expression is being directly repressed in the wild type A. vinelandii strain by FdI, then FdI should bind within or proximal to the promoter shown in Fig. 3. If instead FPR expression is being regulated by another protein in the FdI− strain LM100, then that regulatory protein should show evidence of binding the promoter region. To determine if any protein present in A. vinelandii binds specifically to the DNA proximal to the promoter, we undertook a series of gel mobility shift experiments using A. vinelandii extracts. As shown in Fig. 4, we tested a number of overlapping DNA fragments derived from our original clone, which extended 450 bp upstream of the fpr coding region (21Isas J.M. Yannone S.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21258-21263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These fragments were radioisotope labeled and incubated with extracts from the FdI− LM100 strain of A. vinelandii before running them out on a 4.5% nondenaturing gel. In Fig. 4 the free DNA probe migrates fastest and is the lowest band in each lane. The upper bands represent probes where the migration has been retarded due to the association of protein(s) with the DNA. Several fragments very clearly show a significant mobility shift, indicating that some protein(s) present in A. vinelandii extracts binds very tightly to the DNA probe. Further analysis of these data (Fig. 4) localized the specific binding to a 34-bp region of DNA just upstream of the −35 consensus of the promoter (Fig. 5).Figure 5Gel shift fragment map and data summary diagram. A, the entire fpr clone and partial restriction map. The 220- and 330-bp fragments were initially tested for gel mobility shifts, and only the 330-bp fragment showed strong gel mobility shifting.

Vertical dotted lines indicate the region of DNA that was included in all fragments that shifted and excluded in all fragments that failed to shift.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the importance of this region and to examine this region further, we performed the gel shift experiment using a 60-bpAlu I to Mse I fragment of DNA that extends from the 5′ end of the −35 hexamer, upstream (Fig. 5). Protein extracts were prepared from parallel cultures of wild type A. vinelandii and the FdI− strain LM100 and harvested at the same cell density; purified FdI was also used. As shown in Fig.6 both wild type and LM100 extracts gave strong shifts with the 60-bp probe, confirming that there is a protein present inA. vinelandii that binds to this region. The data in Fig. 6further show that the protein cannot be FdI because the protein responsible for the shift is present in LM100, and no shift is seen with high concentrations of purified FdI. In separate experiments DNA fragments representing the entire 450-bp upstream region were also tested for binding to purified Av FdI, and no binding was detected in any of those experiments. It should be noted that although experiments of the type shown in Fig. 6 do not give quantitative information about the relative amounts of the DNA-binding proteins present in wild type versus LM100, we always observe strong shifts for extracts from both types of cells. Inspection of the sequence (Fig. 3) of the DNA just upstream of the −35 hexamer of the promoter identified a palindromic sequence that is a likely site for the binding of a regulatory protein. To test the importance of this palindrome, the sequence in that region was randomized. Fig. 7 shows that the protein present in theA. vinelandii wild type strain and in FdI−strain LM100 that binds specifically to the DNA just upstream of the −35 consensus (complex B) no longer binds when the palindrome has been mutated, further confirming the binding site. The other weaker binding complexes A and C appear to persist in the mutant palindrome probes, indicating that the binding is not specific for the palindrome. To try to correlate the gel shift results with the overexpression of FPR in LM100, a luciferase reporter gene was placed under the control of the A. vinelandii fpr promoter. This translational fusion was then subcloned into the broad-host-range multicopy plasmid pKT230 (29Vasquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S.E. Burgess B.K. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which was then introduced into both the wild type and LM100 strains of A. vinelandii. As shown in Fig. 8 A, the luciferase activity was enhanced about 7-fold in LM100 relative to the wild type strain, further confirming that the up-regulation of FPR levels in LM100 is due to regulation at the fpr promoter. This construct was then mutated only at the palindrome by randomizing the palindromic sequence. As shown in Fig. 8 B the level of luciferase activity in LM100 was reduced to that of the wild type when driven by a promoter with a mutant palindrome. These data demonstrate not only that FdI regulates FPR expression through the identified palindrome but also that the regulation is activation rather than repression. If the gene were regulated by a repressor protein, then disruption of the protein DNA interaction should have led to an increase of luciferase activity in the wild type rather than the observed result that levels of activity declined in LM100. Taken together the above data demonstrate thatfpr transcription in A. vinelandii is activated in response to deletion of fdxA, that the activation results from interactions at a specific palindrome, and that a putative regulatory protein other than FdI binds to that plaindrome. Thus, the proposal that FdI might regulate FPR expression directly by acting as a novel repressor protein (12Thomson A.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) is not correct. The similarity between theE. coli FPR and the A. vinelandii FPR proteins led us to compare the sequence of the regulatory palindrome identified here to the region upstream of the fpr promoter in E. coli. The alignment illustrated in Fig. 9 shows ∼50% identity between the palindrome identified in this study and the parallel E. coli region. The locations of both regions relative to the promoter are also very similar. In E. coli this region has been defined as a SoxS binding site (30Jair K.-W. Fawcett W.P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Wolf Jr., R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and SoxS has been shown to activate fpr transcription in that organism (31Liochev S. Hausladen A. Beyer Jr., W. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further studies will therefore be directed at determining ifA. vinelandii has a SoxRS-like system and if FdI might serve as a redox sensor whose specific function would be to inactivate that system."

When this preparation was incubated at 37 °C in the absence of Rb+, it lost half of its Rb+ occluding capacity and two-thirds of its Na+ occluding capacity. Comparison of the Rb+occlusion-deocclusion kinetics of the digested enzyme before and after partial inactivation indicated that (a) the affinities of the labile and the stable halves of occluded Rb+ were the same; (b) occlusion and deocclusion rates of the stable pool were lower than those of the labile pool; (c) ATP at a low affinity site (K0.5 = 25–300 μm) increased deocclusion rate in the stable pool and occlusion rate in the labile pool; (d) Na+increased Rb+ deocclusion rate of the sum of the two pools but not that of the stable pool; and (e) occlusion and deocclusion rates of both pools were decreased by ouabain. These findings suggest that (a) the peptide complex of the digested enzyme contains two distinct but interacting cation occlusion pockets, one occluding two Na+ or one Rb+, and the other occluding one Na+ or one Rb+; (b) this peptide complex that is devoid of the catalytic ATP site retains an allosteric ATP site; and (c) the access channels of the two pockets are regulated differently by ATP but similarly by ouabain. Analyses of the gel electrophoretic patterns of the digested enzyme and the N termini of the appropriate bands showed that inactivation of the labile occlusion pocket was accompanied by 60–70% loss of two α-fragments containing H3-H4 and H5-H6transmembrane domains. This and the previously established interactions among the transmembrane helices of α- and β-subunits suggest that one occlusion pocket is associated with H3-H6domains and that the other is located within a complex of β-subunit and two α-fragments containing H1-H2 and H7-H10 transmembrane domains.

Na+/K+-ATPase catalyzes the coupled active transport of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membranes of most eucaryotic cells (1Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). For the transmembrane movement of K+ during the normal cycle of the enzyme, extracellular K+ must pass through narrow access channels before it is occluded at the K+ binding sites and subsequently released inside the cell (2Läuger P. Kaplan J.H. DeWeer P. The Sodium Pump: Structure, Mechanism and Regulation. The Rockefeller University Press, New York1991: 303-315Google Scholar, 3Annu. Rev. Biochem., 59, 171–205 Glynn, I.

Our previous studies on the kinetics of interaction of Rb+ (a congener of K+) with the purified Na+/K+-ATPase indicated that the width of the access channels connecting the medium to the Rb+occlusion sites of the protein are allosterically regulated by Na+, ouabain, and ATP at a low affinity site (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transport of cytosolic Na+ to the extracellular medium also involves the occlusion of Na+ within the enzyme (3Annu. Rev. Biochem., 59, 171–205 Glynn, I. M., and Karlish, S. J. D. (199) Annu. Rev. Biochem., 59, 171–205.Google Scholar, 4Forbush III, B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268A: 229-248PubMed Google Scholar), but the access channels of these Na+ occlusion sites have not been characterized at the level of the isolated purified enzyme. It is often assumed that the occlusion pockets (binding sites and access channels) for Na+ and K+ are different conformational states of the same protein domains (4Forbush III, B. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 268A: 229-248PubMed Google Scholar, 6Or E. David P. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16929-16937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although separate pathways for occlusions of Na+ and K+ have also been advocated (7Arato-Oshima T. Matsui H. Wakizaka A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25604-25610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Extensive tryptic digestion of the purified membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase in the presence of Rb+ removes about half of the enzyme protein consisting of the cytoplasmic domains of the α-subunit (8Karlish S.J.D.

The remaining membrane preparation, which is composed of the essentially intact β-subunit and several α-fragments containing all transmembrane domains and their extracellular loops, has no ATPase activity but retains full capacity to occlude Na+ and Rb+ (8Karlish S.J.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have become valuable tools for studies on the relation of structure to cation occlusion and transport. For example, it has been reported recently (12Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that the selective release of one of the α-fragments (Gln737–Arg830) from the trypsin-digested preparation impairs Rb+ occlusion capacity, suggesting that the H5-H6 hairpin that is within this fragment has a key role in cation pumping by the enzyme.The purpose of the present work was 2-fold. First, in view of the increasing use of the fragmented preparations of the enzyme for the characterization of the cation occlusion sites, we wished to use the same approach we had used with the purified intact enzyme (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to characterize the access channels of the Rb+ occlusion sites in the extensively trypsin-digested enzyme. Second, we wished to assess the suggested role of H5-H6 transmembrane domains in the regulation of the Rb+ occlusion sites and their access channels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurified membrane-bound Na+/K+-ATPase of canine kidney medulla, with specific activity of 1000–1600 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed per mg of protein/h, was prepared and assayed as described before (13Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This native enzyme was used to make the following two preparations. (a) The enzyme was exposed to trypsin in the presence of Rb+ and EDTA at pH 8.5 according to Karlish et al. (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) to remove large portions of the cytoplasmic domains of the α-subunit and obtain a preparation composed of an essentially intact β-subunit and four characterized fragments of α containing all 10 transmembrane helices of α (8Karlish S.J.D.

We established experimentally that after digestion less than 1% of the intact α-subunit remained. This preparation is often called the 19-kDa membrane because its cation occlusion capacity was originally thought to be due to a C-terminal fragment of α with apparent molecular mass of 19-kDa (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because it is now evident that more than one peptide of this preparation is involved in its functions (9Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6853-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and to avoid confusion, we shall simply refer to this preparation as the digested enzyme. (b) The digested enzyme was suspended (1 mg/ml) in a solution containing 0.2 msucrose and 12 mm histidine (pH 6.8) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. 10 volumes of the ice-cold sucrose-histidine were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. After resuspension of the pellet and centrifugation for the second time, the pellet was then suspended in the same sucrose-histidine solution prior to use. It will be shown under “Results” that this incubation procedure causes the partial loss of cation occlusion capacity. This partially inactivated preparation will be referred to as the digested modified enzyme.Assay of occluded Rb+ and experiments on the kinetics of Rb+ occlusion-deocclusion at 4 °C were done as we have described before (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Occluded Na+ was assayed according to Karlish et al. (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D.

Our experiments (Fig. 1) also showed that loss of Rb+occlusion capacity plateaued at about 50% of the control value. Lutsenko et al. (12Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such long incubation periods were also necessary for the two digested preparations, as exemplified by the data of Fig. 2 a showing the time courses of binding to the two preparations at 500 μmRb+. In experiments of Fig. 2 b we used the two digested preparations and determined bound Rb+ after 24 h of incubation at 4 °C at varying Rb+concentrations. The results showed that K0.5 of Rb+ was nearly the same (about 50 μm) in both preparations but that the maximal binding level of the digested modified preparation was about half of the level of the original digested preparation (Fig. 2 b). Clearly, the remaining Rb+ binding after partial inactivation represents highly specific occlusion at sites having similar affinities to those of the occlusion sites of the original digested enzyme.Figure 2a, time course of the occlusion of Rb+ by the digested enzyme and the digested modified enzyme.

Deocclusion rate of the digested enzyme was greater than that of the native enzyme. After half of the occlusion capacity of the digested enzyme was inactivated, the deocclusion rate of the remaining half was reduced to a level below that of the native enzyme (Fig. 3 a). ATP (2 mm) stimulated deocclusion in both digested preparations (Fig.3 b), but the ATP effect was clearly more dramatic on the digested modified preparation.Figure 3a, spontaneous deocclusion rates of occluded Rb+ from the control enzyme, the digested enzyme, and the digested modified enzyme.

The data (not shown) indicated that ADP and CTP, but not AMP and GTP, stimulated Rb+deocclusion. Thus, the specificity of the low affinity nucleotide effect on the two digested preparations is the same as that of the native enzyme (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In experiments of Fig. 5 effects of ATP on the initial rates of Rb+ occlusion at 4 °C in the two digested preparations were examined. At both Rb+ concentrations used (5 and 200 μm) the initial rates in the absence of ATP were higher in the unmodified digested enzyme (Fig. 5). At both Rb+ concentrations, ATP stimulated the initial rates in the unmodified digested enzyme but not in the digested modified preparation (Fig. 5). Using the unmodified digested enzyme, we established (data not shown) that ATP stimulation of Rb+ occlusion was also a low affinity effect of ATP and had the same nucleotide specificity as the ATP stimulation of Rb+ occlusion rate in the native enzyme (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 5Effects of ATP on the time course of Rb+ occlusion by the digested and the digested modified enzymes. The preparations were incubated at 4 °C with 5 (a) or 200 μm86Rb+(b) in the absence or the presence of 2 mm ATP, and occluded Rb+ was assayed at indicated times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ouabain Effects on Rb+ Occlusion-Deocclusion in the Digested EnzymesAs in the native enzyme (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ouabain decreased Rb+ occlusion and deocclusion rates in both digested preparations, as exemplified by the data of Fig. 6. These ouabain effects were saturable (Fig. 6, inset), with apparent ouabain affinities significantly lower than the binding constant of ouabain for the native canine enzyme as determined by equilibrium binding studies under optimal conditions (13Askari A. Huang W.-H. McCormick P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in the native enzyme (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ouabain blocked the stimulatory effect of ATP on the Rb+ occlusion rate in the digested enzyme (data not shown).Figure 6Effect of ouabain on Rb+occlusion rate by the digested enzyme. The digested enzyme was preincubated for 20 min at 24 °C in the absence of ouabain or in the presence of 1 mm ouabain. The preparations were then incubated at 4 °C with 5 μm86Rb+ and assayed for occluded Rb+.Inset, the results of similar experiments in which ouabain concentration was varied, and occlusion was measured after 60 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Na+ Effects on Rb+ Occlusion-Deocclusion in the Digested EnzymesIn the native enzyme, Rb+occlusion is competitively inhibited by Na+ (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shani M. Goldschleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 904: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, Na+ also binds to the native enzyme containing occluded Rb+ and accelerates the rate of Rb+deocclusion (5Hasenauer J. Huang W.-H. Askari A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3289-3297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter allosteric effect of Na+ on Rb+ deocclusion was clearly observed on the digested preparation but not in the digested modified preparation (Fig.7 a). In both digested preparations, however, Rb+ occlusion was similarly inhibited by Na+(Fig. 7 b).Figure 7a, effects of Na+ on the time courses of Rb+ release from the digested and the digested modified enzymes. 86Rb+ was occluded as indicated in Fig. 3, and deocclusion rates were determined by incubation at 4 °C in medium free of Na+ and containing the indicated Na+ concentrations. b, inhibition of Rb+ occlusion by Na+ in the digested and the digested modified enzymes. The preparations were incubated with 200 μm86Rb+ at 4 °C in medium containing no Na+ or the indicated Na+concentrations. Rb+ occlusion was assayed after 24 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Na+ Occlusion Capacities of the Digested EnzymeA portion of a control native enzyme preparation was trypsin-digested, and a portion of this digested preparation was converted to the digested modified preparation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Na+ occlusion capacities of the three related preparations were then compared in the presence of oligomycin, using 10 mm22Na+, which is known to be near-saturating for Na+ occlusion by the native and the digested enzymes (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In three determinations the values (nmol/mg ± S.E.) were: native enzyme, 6.2 ± 0.3; digested enzyme, 13.7 ± 0.5; and digested modified enzyme, 4.5 ± 0.3. Evidently, the same treatment that causes inactivation of half of the Rb+ occlusion capacity of the digested enzyme (Figs. 1and 2 b) also causes the loss of two-thirds of its Na+ occlusion capacity. That the Na+ occlusion capacity of the digested enzyme is about double that of the native enzyme is in keeping with the loss of about half of the protein content of the native enzyme due to trypsin digestion (8Karlish S.J.D. Goldshleger R. Stein W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4566-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).Peptide Compositions of the Digested EnzymesAfter the digested enzyme was treated under partial inactivating conditions and centrifuged (Fig. 1), the supernatant was saved and concentrated, and the pellet was washed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A control sample of the digested enzyme that was incubated in the presence of Rb+ and was not inactivated (Fig. 1) was similarly treated. The supernatants and the pellets were then labeled with CPM and resolved on Tricine/SDS gels (Fig.8 a). Alternatively, the samples that were treated similarly but not exposed to CPM were resolved on the same gels and stained with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 8 b).Figure 8Structural changes induced by the partial inactivation of the occlusion capacity of the digested enzyme. A sample of the digested enzyme was partially inactivated as in Fig. 1, and an equal amount of the digested enzyme (control) was similarly treated in the presence of Rb+ to prevent inactivation. After centrifugation, each supernatant or washed pellet was labeled with fluorescent CPM as indicated under “Experimental Procedures,” and comparable portions were resolved on 16.5% Tricine gels in duplicate (a). Comparable portions of the supernatants and the pellets were similarly treated without exposure to CPM, resolved on the same gels in duplicate, and stained with Coomassie Blue (b). Lanes 1 and 2, supernatant of the partially inactivated sample. Lanes 3 and 4, control supernatant. Lanes 5 and 6, partially inactivated pellet. Lanes 7 and 8, control pellet.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As evident from the gel patterns of the pellets (Fig. 8, lanes 5–8), the most obvious difference between the two preparations is the lower intensity of a band with the apparent molecular mass of 10-kDa in the digested modified preparation. When all other stained bands of the pellets (Fig. 8 b, lanes 5–8) were quantitated by densitometry, no significant differences between the digested and the digested modified samples were noted (data not shown). It is also evident from Fig. 8 (lanes 1–4) that the supernatant of the digested modified preparation, but not that of the control, contains a 10-kDa band. These results are in general agreement with those of Lutsenko et al. (12Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).When the 10-kDa band of the supernatant (combined from several gels such as those of Fig. 8 b, lanes 1 and2) was subjected to N-terminal analysis, one prominent sequence of QAADMILLDDN was found confirming the findings of Lutsenko et al. (12Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and indicating that partial inactivation of occlusion capacity is accompanied by the release of the α-fragment containing the H5-H6 transmembrane domains. To determine if the release of this fragment accounted for the different intensities of the 10-kDa bands of the pellets of the digested and the digested modified samples (Fig. 8 b,lanes 5–8), these bands obtained from equivalent amounts of the two samples were also subjected to N-terminal analysis. The findings (Table I) showed that the band from each sample contained three prominent N termini corresponding to those of the putative γ-subunit (9Capasso J.M. Hoving S. Tal D.M. Goldshleger R.
