For very small power requirements, capacitors have not been competitive with microbatteries, but using monolithic carbon films to store the charge, Chmiola et al. (p. 480 ) demonstrate the feasibility of such applications. The small pores in the carbon films are sufficiently large to allow electrolyte transport and can be made using a processing technique compatible with current chip manufacturing. Such microcapacitors can thus be integrated with electronics to make autonomous sensors or implantable devices."

Naturally then, knowing better how climate change might affect the monsoon is tremendously important. One obstacle that prevents a better understanding of future behavior is a poor knowledge of its past. Cook et al. (p. 486 ; see the Perspective by Wahl and Morrill ) help to fill this gap with a 700-year reconstruction of the monsoon from tree-ring data obtained throughout Asia. The reconstruction chronicles monsoon failures and megadroughts, as well as patterns of precipitation, and can thus be compared with other relevant climate records to allow links with sea-surface temperatures to be better understood."

Current therapy relies upon a combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin, a poorly tolerated regimen typically associated with less than 50% sustained virological response rate in those infected with genotype 1 virus. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV has focused predominantly on inhibitors of the viral enzymes NS3 protease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B. Here we describe the profile of BMS-790052, a small molecule inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein that exhibits picomolar half-maximum effective concentrations (EC(50)) towards replicons expressing a broad range of HCV genotypes and the JFH-1 genotype 2a infectious virus in cell culture. In a phase I clinical trial in patients chronically infected with HCV, administration of a single 100-mg dose of BMS-790052 was associated with a 3.3 log(10) reduction in mean viral load measured 24 h post-dose that was sustained for an additional 120 h in two patients infected with genotype 1b virus. Genotypic analysis of samples taken at baseline, 24 and 144 h post-dose revealed that the major HCV variants observed had substitutions at amino-acid positions identified using the in vitro replicon system. These results provide the first clinical validation of an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, a protein with no known enzymatic function, as an approach to the suppression of virus replication that offers potential as part of a therapeutic regimen based on combinations of HCV inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2083540641,"A key question in developmental biology is how cells exchange positional information for proper patterning during organ development. In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved with a central vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor in one direction and microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT, produced in the vascular cylinder, moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR165a and MIR166b. Endodermally produced microRNA165/6 then acts to degrade its target mRNAs encoding class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors in the endodermis and stele periphery. The resulting differential distribution of target mRNA in the vascular cylinder determines xylem cell types in a dosage-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1985769321,"siRNA Movement in Plant Tissues Long-distance movement of RNA interference (RNAi)–derived signals in plants plays an important role in development and in defense against viral attack. The nature of the signals that spread from cell to cell is not known, although evidence suggests that they are nucleic acids of some sort (see the Perspective by Martienssen ). Molnar et al. (p. 872 , published online 22 April) and Dunoyer et al. (p. 912 , published online 22 April) now show that in Arabidopsis , both exogenous and endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), rather than their long double-stranded precursor RNAs, are the molecules that transfer information between plant cells. A viral protein that counters RNAi though sequestering siRNAs blocked spreading of a transgene RNAi silencing signal. Furthermore, siRNA-processing enzymes were required in the source, and not the recipient, cells for spreading, and bombardment of plants with double-stranded siRNAs directly showed siRNA spread between cells. Endogenous siRNAs also spread between tissues and were capable of directing DNA methylation of target sequences in distant tissues."

https://openalex.org/W2076353383,"Transcription and Translation in Train In bacteria, translation of messenger RNA into proteins by the ribosome usually begins soon after the ribosome binding site emerges from RNA polymerase. Now there is evidence for direct coupling between transcription and translation in bacteria. Proshkin et al. (p. 504 ; see the Perspective by Roberts ) show that the trailing ribosome controls the rate of transcription by preventing RNA polymerase from spontaneous backtracking, which allows precise adjustment of transcriptional yield to translational needs under various growth conditions. Burmann et al. (p. 501 ; see the Perspective by Roberts ) provide a potential mechanism for coupling by showing that the transcription factor NusG, which binds RNA polymerase through its amino-terminal domain, competitively binds either a ribosomal protein or the Rho transcription termination factor through its carboxy-terminal domain. Rho binding might occur after release of the ribosome from messenger RNA, thus linking termination of transcription and translation."
https://openalex.org/W1966479481,"Breaking Convention The defining characteristics of a superconductor are symmetry of gap function, which tells us something about how pairs of electrons move through the sample, and the strength of that pairing. Together, this information gives us the highest temperature to which the superconductor can remain superconducting. In conventional superconductors the gap function is symmetric, or s-wave, and tends to have low transition temperatures. The newly discovered iron-based superconductors also have s -wave symmetry, but the rather high transition temperatures, in addition to other properties, indicate that they are not conventional. Hanaguri et al. (p. 474 ; see the Perspective by Hoffman ) use scanning tunneling microscopy to provide direct experimental confirmation of the unconventional s -wave pairing of the superconducting carriers in these materials."
https://openalex.org/W2074023228,"Vast world reserves of methane gas are underutilized as a feedstock for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals owing to the lack of economical and sustainable strategies for the selective oxidation of methane to methanol. Current processes to activate the strong C-H bond (104 kcal mol(-1)) in methane require high temperatures, are costly and inefficient, and produce waste. In nature, methanotrophic bacteria perform this reaction under ambient conditions using metalloenzymes called methane monooxygenases (MMOs). MMOs thus provide the optimal model for an efficient, environmentally sound catalyst. There are two types of MMO. Soluble MMO (sMMO) is expressed by several strains of methanotroph under copper-limited conditions and oxidizes methane with a well-characterized catalytic di-iron centre. Particulate MMO (pMMO) is an integral membrane metalloenzyme produced by all methanotrophs and is composed of three subunits, pmoA, pmoB and pmoC, arranged in a trimeric alpha(3)beta(3)gamma(3) complex. Despite 20 years of research and the availability of two crystal structures, the metal composition and location of the pMMO metal active site are not known. Here we show that pMMO activity is dependent on copper, not iron, and that the copper active site is located in the soluble domains of the pmoB subunit rather than within the membrane. Recombinant soluble fragments of pmoB (spmoB) bind copper and have propylene and methane oxidation activities. Disruption of each copper centre in spmoB by mutagenesis indicates that the active site is a dicopper centre. These findings help resolve the pMMO controversy and provide a promising new approach to developing environmentally friendly C-H oxidation catalysts."

https://openalex.org/W2139472455,"Reversible S-palmitoylation of cysteine residues critically controls transient membrane tethering of peripheral membrane proteins. Little is known about how the palmitoylation machinery governs their defined localization and function. We monitored the spatially resolved reaction dynamics and substrate specificity of the core mammalian palmitoylation machinery using semisynthetic substrates. Palmitoylation is detectable only on the Golgi, whereas depalmitoylation occurs everywhere in the cell. The reactions are not stereoselective and lack any primary consensus sequence, demonstrating that substrate specificity is not essential for de-/repalmitoylation. Both palmitate attachment and removal require seconds to accomplish. This reaction topography and rapid kinetics allows the continuous redirection of mislocalized proteins via the post-Golgi sorting apparatus. Unidirectional secretion ensures the maintenance of a proper steady-state protein distribution between the Golgi and the plasma membrane, which are continuous with endosomes. This generic spatially organizing system differs from conventional receptor-mediated targeting mechanisms and efficiently counteracts entropy-driven redistribution of palmitoylated peripheral membrane proteins over all membranes."

https://openalex.org/W2082160346,"The cerebral cortex constructs a coherent representation of the world by integrating distinct features of the sensory environment. Although these features are processed vertically across cortical layers, horizontal projections interconnecting neighbouring cortical domains allow these features to be processed in a context-dependent manner. Despite the wealth of physiological and psychophysical studies addressing the function of horizontal projections, how they coordinate activity among cortical domains remains poorly understood. We addressed this question by selectively activating horizontal projection neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, and determined how the resulting spatial pattern of excitation and inhibition affects cortical activity. We found that horizontal projections suppress superficial layers while simultaneously activating deeper cortical output layers. This layer-specific modulation does not result from a spatial separation of excitation and inhibition, but from a layer-specific ratio between these two opposing conductances. Through this mechanism, cortical domains exploit horizontal projections to compete for cortical space. A common anatomical feature of sensory cortex in many species is that neurons processing similar features cluster into vertically oriented domains spanning all layers of the cortex. In addition, neurons modulate other neurons located in neighbouring domains through extensive horizontal connections. Using a combination of optogenetic activation and simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from multiple cortical layers, Hillel Adesnik and Massimo Scanziani characterize the cellular basis of these interactions. They find that horizontal projections suppress layers of cortex devoted to processing inputs, but facilitate layers devoted to outputs. This organization may enable neurons in one cortical domain to expand their functional territory. A common anatomical feature of the sensory cortex in many species is that neurons with similar features cluster into vertically orientated domains spanning all layers of the cortex. Moreover, neurons in one domain modulate neurons in neighbouring domains through horizontal connections. A combination of techniques has now been used to show that such horizontal projections suppress layers of cortex devoted to processing inputs, but facilitate layers devoted to outputs."

https://openalex.org/W2043291304,"All Together Now In the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum , periodic synthesis and release of cyclic AMP (cAMP) guides the cellular aggregation required to form fruiting bodies. It has been unclear whether the initiation of this behavior is owing to synchronization of autonomously oscillating cells or whether individual cells remain nonoscillatory unless the entire population becomes oscillatory. Gregor et al. (p. 1021 , published online 22 April; see the Perspective by Prindle and Hasty ) used live-cell imaging to show that cAMP pulses originate from a specific location in space and that individual cells move in and out of these signaling centers. The observations suggest that oscillations do not originate from autonomous activities of specialized cells. However, individual cells do display stochastic cAMP-pulsing below a threshold external concentration of cAMP, and the generation of synchronized oscillations could only be modeled accurately when this random pulsing was taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W1971803930,"Nanosynthesis Without a Twist The synthesis of many nanoscale materials occurs under conditions of changing saturation because generation of product decreases the concentration of reactants. Morin et al. (p. 476 ) used a flow reactor to maintain conditions of low supersaturation during the growth of zinc oxide nanotubes and nanowires. Under these conditions, growth of the tubes was controlled by the release of stress, which prevented the torquing of the crystals along their axis. Since growth at different saturation conditions matched predictions, this looks like a promising method to develop rational and controlled synthesis of nanomaterials at large scale and low cost."
https://openalex.org/W2083882357,"The structure of the sodium-benzylhydantoin transport protein Mhp1 from Microbacterium liquefaciens comprises a five-helix inverted repeat, which is widespread among secondary transporters. Here, we report the crystal structure of an inward-facing conformation of Mhp1 at 3.8 angstroms resolution, complementing its previously described structures in outward-facing and occluded states. From analyses of the three structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism for the transport cycle in Mhp1. Switching from the outward- to the inward-facing state, to effect the inward release of sodium and benzylhydantoin, is primarily achieved by a rigid body movement of transmembrane helices 3, 4, 8, and 9 relative to the rest of the protein. This forms the basis of an alternating access mechanism applicable to many transporters of this emerging superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W1988979641,"New observations in the infrared provide the first indications of the atmospheric composition of a 'hot Neptune' extrasolar planet, Gliese 436b (GJ 436b). A companion to an M-dwarf star, GJ 436b exhibits a high abundance of carbon monoxide. Water and trace amounts of carbon dioxide are also present but the concentration of methane, expected to be the dominant carbon-bearing species in a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, is 100,000 times less than predicted for a planet in thermochemical equilibrium. Possible disruptive influences include vertical mixing and methane polymerization. The measurements were accomplished at six wavelengths using the Spitzer Space Telescope while the planet passed behind its parent star on a short, 2.64-day orbit. Here, the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet GJ 436b is studied during its 'secondary eclipse'. The findings reveal the presence of some H2O and traces of CO2. The best-fit compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models for the predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing and polymerization of methane may be required to explain this small methane-to-CO ratio. The nearby extrasolar planet GJ 436b—which has been labelled as a ‘hot Neptune’—reveals itself by the dimming of light as it crosses in front of and behind its parent star as seen from Earth. Respectively known as the primary transit and secondary eclipse, the former constrains the planet’s radius and mass1,2, and the latter constrains the planet’s temperature3,4 and, with measurements at multiple wavelengths, its atmospheric composition. Previous work5 using transmission spectroscopy failed to detect the 1.4-μm water vapour band, leaving the planet’s atmospheric composition poorly constrained. Here we report the detection of planetary thermal emission from the dayside of GJ 436b at multiple infrared wavelengths during the secondary eclipse. The best-fit compositional models contain a high CO abundance and a substantial methane (CH4) deficiency relative to thermochemical equilibrium models6 for the predicted hydrogen-dominated atmosphere7,8. Moreover, we report the presence of some H2O and traces of CO2. Because CH4 is expected to be the dominant carbon-bearing species, disequilibrium processes such as vertical mixing9 and polymerization of methane10 into substances such as ethylene may be required to explain the hot Neptune’s small CH4-to-CO ratio, which is at least 105 times smaller than predicted6."

https://openalex.org/W2086153601,"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression in the plant model Arabidopsis, and intriguingly the vast majority of the small RNAs involved are generated from methylated regions of the genome. A previously unknown protein termed RdDM (for regulator of RNA-directed DNA methylation) has now been identified in Arabidopsis, throwing more light on the interactions of epigenetics, DNA methylation and small RNAs in plants. RDM1 is a novel methyl DNA-binding protein that binds to single-stranded methylated DNA: the many methyl DNA-binding proteins known previously in plants and animals bind only to double-stranded methylated DNA. RDM1 interacts with complexes of the effector protein Argonaute 4 (AGO4) with siRNAs to direct de novo DNA methylation and gene silencing. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in many eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis plants, small interfering RNAs bound to the Argonaute 4 (AGO4) protein can direct de novo DNA methylation and consequent gene silencing. Here, a new regulator of RNA-directed DNA methylation has been discovered. This protein, RDM1, is proposed to bind to methylated DNA and to function in the AGO4 effector complex. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in many eukaryotes1,2,3,4,5. In plants, 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) bound to the effector protein, Argonaute 4 (AGO4), can direct de novo DNA methylation by the methyltransferase DRM2 (refs 2, 4–6). Here we report a new regulator of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis: RDM1. Loss-of-function mutations in the RDM1 gene impair the accumulation of 24-nucleotide siRNAs, reduce DNA methylation, and release transcriptional gene silencing at RdDM target loci. RDM1 encodes a small protein that seems to bind single-stranded methyl DNA, and associates and co-localizes with RNA polymerase II (Pol II, also known as NRPB), AGO4 and DRM2 in the nucleus. Our results indicate that RDM1 is a component of the RdDM effector complex and may have a role in linking siRNA production with pre-existing or de novo cytosine methylation. Our results also indicate that, although RDM1 and Pol V (also known as NRPE) may function together at some RdDM target sites in the peri-nucleolar siRNA processing centre, Pol II rather than Pol V is associated with the RdDM effector complex at target sites in the nucleoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2000313986,"During infection, pathogenic bacteria manipulate the host cell in various ways to allow their own replication, propagation and escape from host immune responses. Post-translational modifications are unique mechanisms that allow cells to rapidly, locally and specifically modify activity or interactions of key proteins. Some of these modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, can be induced by pathogens. However, the effects of pathogenic bacteria on SUMOylation, an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, remain largely unknown. Here we show that infection with Listeria monocytogenes leads to a decrease in the levels of cellular SUMO-conjugated proteins. This event is triggered by the bacterial virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO), which induces a proteasome-independent degradation of Ubc9, an essential enzyme of the SUMOylation machinery, and a proteasome-dependent degradation of some SUMOylated proteins. The effect of LLO on Ubc9 is dependent on the pore-forming capacity of the toxin and is shared by other bacterial pore-forming toxins like perfringolysin O (PFO) and pneumolysin (PLY). Ubc9 degradation was also observed in vivo in infected mice. Furthermore, we show that SUMO overexpression impairs bacterial infection. Together, our results reveal that Listeria, and probably other pathogens, dampen the host response by decreasing the SUMOylation level of proteins critical for infection."

However, the structures and mechanisms mediating TRPV1's pronounced temperature sensitivity remain unclear. Recent studies of the related channel TRPV3 identified residues in the pore region that are required for heat activation. We used both random and targeted mutagenesis screens of rat TRPV1 and identified point mutations in the outer pore region that specifically impair temperature activation. Single-channel analysis indicated that TRPV1 mutations disrupted heat sensitivity by ablating long channel openings, which are part of the temperature-gating pathway. We propose that sequential occupancy of short and long open states on activation provides a mechanism for enhancing temperature sensitivity. Our results suggest that the outer pore is important for the heat sensitivity of thermoTRPs."

Zachariah and Cyster (p. 1129 , published online 22 April) found that selective expression of a transgene for the S1P receptor-1 in mouse thymocytes was sufficient for thymocyte egress. Thymocyte egress occurred at corticomedullary junctions via blood vessels, rather than via lymphatics.

Because both TRPV3 and TRPV4 are expressed in keratinocytes and are activated by a similar range of temperatures, these channels likely have distinct functions in the skin.

The skin constitutes an interface between the external environment and the body, serving as a hydrophobic barrier essential for protection against infection from the outside and dehydration from the inside. The skin barrier function is achieved by keratinocytes in the epidermis, which consists of a basal layer and several differentiated layers covered with a cornified layer at the surface. The main barrier function is achieved by a cornified layer-dependent hydrophobic barrier (17Kalinin A.E. Kajava A.V. Steinert P.M. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), which is composed of a continuous sheet of protein-enriched cells embedded in an extracellular non-polar lipid layer (18Proksch E. Brandner J.M. Jensen J.M. Exp. Dermatol. 2008; 17: 1063-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). In addition to this, a barrier mediated by cell-cell junctions (19Tsukita S. Furuse M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) beneath the cornified layer, including tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs), has recently been highlighted as an essential structure of the skin barrier function (20Niessen C.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 2525-2532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). An extensive epidermal water loss was observed in mice lacking claudin-1, the main component of the TJ complex, despite an apparently normal cornified layer function (21Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice lacking E-cadherin specifically in the developing epidermis, the main component of the AJ complex, phenocopied the claudin-1-deficient mice (22Tunggal J.A. Helfrich I. Schmitz A. Schwarz H. Günzel D. Fromm M. Kemler R. Krieg T. Niessen C.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Thus, proper formation of AJs and TJs is indispensable for the skin barrier function preventing dehydration. In support of this, some skin diseases with barrier disruption are related to AJ and TJ abnormality; lack of extracellular domain of E-cadherin or absence of claudin-1 protein has been reported in Hailey-Hailey disease (23Hakuno M. Shimizu H. Akiyama M. Amagai M. Wahl J.K. Wheelock M.J. Nishikawa T. Br. J. Dermatol. 2000; 142: 702-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or in neonatal ichthyosis and sclerosing cholangitis syndrome (24Hadj-Rabia S. Baala L. Vabres P. Hamel-Teillac D. Jacquemin E.

The formation of cell-cell junctions in keratinocytes critically depends on rearrangement of actin fibers during the differentiation process (25Bershadsky A. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 589-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Mège R.M. Gavard J. Lambert M. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar), which can be initiated by an increase in extracellular Ca2+ (a Ca2+ switch) in vitro (28Turksen K. Epidermal Cells: Methods and Protocols. Vol. 289. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 23-26Google Scholar). In fact, the formation of a Ca2+ gradient in the epidermis has been reported in vivo with higher extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ levels in the differentiated cell layers (28Turksen K. Epidermal Cells: Methods and Protocols. Vol. 289. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2004: 23-26Google Scholar, 29Bikle D.D. Oda Y. Xie Z. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89–90: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that some Ca2+-permeable TRP channels are involved in keratinocyte differentiation (30Cai S. Fatherazi S. Presland R.B. Belton C.M. Roberts F.A. Goodwin P.C. Schubert M.M. Izutsu K.T. Pflugers Arch. 2006; 452: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Lehen'kyi V. Beck B. Polakowska R. Charveron M. Bordat P. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22582-22591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the ion channels to the cell-cell junction formation has not been elucidated. In seeking a potential role of TRPV4 in keratinocytes, we found that the channel interacts with β-catenin and E-cadherin, both of which are basic components of AJs. We investigated the significance of TRPV4 in cell-cell junction development and the integrity of intercellular permeability by comparing skin and primary keratinocytes obtained from wild-type and TRPV4-deficient mice. The involvement of TRPV4 in the increase of intracellular Ca2+ at physiological skin temperatures and in Rho activation was also examined, both of which are important for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in skin. Finally, TRPV4 localization and junction structure among keratinocytes were investigated. The following antibodies were used: mAb anti-β-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories), mAb anti-GFP (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), mAb anti-FLAG (Sigma), mAb anti-HA (3F10) (Roche Applied Science), mAb anti-E-cadherin (ECCD2) (a generous gift from Dr. M. Takeichi, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (CDB), Kobe, Japan), pAb anti-claudin-1 (IBL, Takasaki, Japan), pAb anti-occludin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), pAb anti-TRPV4 (prepared against an N-terminal peptide of TRPV4 (32Shibasaki K. Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Tominaga M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)), pAb anti-rat TRPV4 (33Gevaert T. Vriens J. Segal A. Everaerts W. Roskams T. Talavera K. Owsianik G. Liedtke W. Daelemans D. Dewachter I. Van Leuven F. Voets T. De Ridder D. Nilius B. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 3453-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), and mAb anti-RhoA (Cytoskeleton, Inc.). The specificity of two anti-TRPV4 antibodies is described elsewhere (32Shibasaki K.

Mouse TRPV4 cDNA for a rescue experiment was introduced into a DsRed-Express vector (Clontech). COS-7 cell culture and cDNA transfection of the cells were carried out as described previously (34Meng W. Numazaki M. Takeuchi K. Uchibori Y. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tominaga M. Tominaga T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes were obtained from newborn wild-type mice, TRPV4-deficient mice (35Mizuno A. Matsumoto N. Imai M. Suzuki M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and TRPV3-deficient mice (13Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N. Spencer K.S. Andahazy M. Story G.M. Patapoutian A. Science. 2005; 307: 1468-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) and cultured in MCDB 153 medium containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 14.1 μg/ml phosphorylethanolamine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (all from Sigma), 10 μg/ml transferrin (Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan), 40 μg/ml bovine pituitary gland extract (Kyokuto, Tokyo, Japan), 25 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum. After incubating the cells in this medium at 37 °C for 24 h, the medium was changed to one without fetal bovine serum. We termed the fetal bovine serum-free medium “0 mm Ca2+ medium,” although it contained 0.04 mm CaCl2. The cells were further incubated for 36–60 h, and a Ca2+ switch was performed by adding 2 mm CaCl2 at 33 °C. We paid attention to mouse age (P2) and the cell density of suspension (1.0 × 106/ml) for keeping experimental conditions constant because both factors correlate with cell viability and proliferation, which influence cell density on the cover glass. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using membrane fraction were performed as described previously (34Meng W. Numazaki M. Takeuchi K. Uchibori Y. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tominaga M. Tominaga T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 760-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For preparing the membrane fraction, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 m Na3VO4). Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g. The pellets were resuspended in TNE buffer with 1% Nonidet P-40 and sonicated for 30 s. Following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the protein concentrations of the supernatants were adjusted and used as a membrane fraction. In rescue experiments, TRPV4 cDNA linking DsRed cDNA at its C terminus was transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) before a Ca2+ switch. Keratinocytes obtained from P2 mice were plated on cover glasses (Warner Instruments, 12 mm) or a Transwell system (Costar, pore size 0.4 μm). The cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with primary antibodies for 90 min at room temperature and then incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 40 min at room temperature. Actin fiber was stained with Alexa Fluor-phalloidin. Back skin from newborn mice was fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%), dehydrated with 20% followed by 30% sucrose, and embedded in OCT compound. The skin sections (16 μm) were stained in a similar manner as described above. Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide. The images were obtained using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus, IX71) or a confocal fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 200M). For measurement of the thickness of the cornified layer and epidermal layers, three positions (approximately left, middle, and right) were randomly picked up from skin section images, and the thickness was measured by the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The averaged value from each image was taken as a thickness of each sample regardless of variable thickness. Immunofluorescent images obtained 4 and 24 h after Ca2+ switch were processed by the ImageJ software. Actin fiber formation was evaluated as (phalloidin-positive area) × (the mean pixel intensity) (arbitrary unit). The cell stratification level was evaluated as (E-cadherin-positive area)/(total image area) × 100 (%). Data were represented as box-and-whisker plots, where sample minimum, lower quartile, median, mean, upper quartile, and sample maximum are indicated (see Fig. 3). Rho activity was evaluated with a Rho activation assay Biochem Kit (Cytoskeleton, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, total cell lysates (300 μg of protein) were collected from keratinocyte cultures on 10-cm dishes, and active Rho (GTP binding form) was pulled down by Rhotekin-Rho binding domain (RBD)-conjugated beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The precipitates were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Rho was detected with mouse anti-RhoA first antibody and anti-mouse IgG-horse radish peroxidase. The chemiluminescent signal was visualized with x-ray film (Kodak). The band intensity was measured and normalized to each input using ImageJ software. For the Lucifer yellow assay, newborn mice (P0) were immersed in 1 mm Lucifer yellow/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h followed by quick freezing. For the toluidine blue assay, P0 mice were dehydrated in 25, 50, 75, and 100% MeOH for 1 min followed by immersion in 0.1% toluidine blue O/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 h. The cornified layer was disrupted by soaking mice in 100% acetone for 15 min prior to dehydration. For the biotin diffusion assay, 10 mg/ml EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-LC Biotin (Promega), phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm CaCl2 was injected into the dermis on the back of P0 mice. The skin was quickly frozen after 30 min. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) was measured on the shaved back skin of anesthetized male mice (7–10 weeks) for four times using a TEWL meter (AS-VT100RS, AsahiBioMed, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C and in 50–55% humidity. After applying acetone-soaked cotton on the shaved back skin for 1 min, the skin was warmed until the surface temperature was increased more than 33 °C. Then, TEWL was measured again on the same area four times. Each averaged value was considered as a datum from an individual mouse. For the dextran permeation assay, P2 primary keratinocytes (6 × 105) were cultured on a Transwell insert in 0 mm Ca2+ medium for 36 h. Twenty-four h after a Ca2+ switch, medium in the insert was replaced with 1 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (Sigma, molecular weight 40,000). Fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorescence in the bottom well was measured using a microplate reader. The permeability of dextran was calculated as fluorescent intensity/collected volume × total volume in the bottom well (arbitrary unit). After a Ca2+ switch was performed (for 24 h at 37 °C), keratinocytes cultured on coverslips were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by postfixation with 1% OsO4 in the same buffer. The subsequent procedures were previously described (36Miyake Y. Inoue N. Nishimura K. Kinoshita N. Hosoya H. Yonemura S. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1637-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes on cover glass were loaded with 5 μm fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) at 33 °C for 1 h, and the fluorescence was measured in a standard bath solution containing (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The solution temperature in the chamber was monitored and adjusted with a thermocouple (TA-30, Warner Instruments). Values were obtained from 100–250 cells in time-lapse images from each cover glass, and the Ca2+ concentration (nm) was calculated as described previously (37Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) with different Ca2+ dissociation constants of fura-2 (270 nm at 24 °C and 240 nm at 33 °C) (38Shuttleworth T.J. Thompson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1410-1414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type (C57BL/6NCr) mice were used as control. TRPV4-deficient mice (35Mizuno A. Matsumoto N. Imai M. Suzuki M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and TRPV3-deficient mice (13Moqrich A. Hwang S.W. Earley T.J. Petrus M.J. Murray A.N.

The N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of TRPV4 was found to bind to the armadillo repeat domain of β-catenin (Fig. 1, A and B). These data are consistent with the notion that β-catenin is predominantly located beneath the plasma membrane together with E-cadherin (39Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 40Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We found the binding of TRPV4 and β-catenin in both a heterologous expression system (Fig. 1C) and primary keratinocytes obtained from neonatal mice (Fig. 1D). β-Catenin co-precipitated with TRPV4 was hardly observed in keratinocytes, which might be due to weak competency of the TRPV4 antibody for immunoprecipitation, relatively low expression level of TRPV4, or both. We also observed that the two proteins interacted with E-cadherin in the membrane fraction of keratinocytes (Fig. 1D, far right), suggesting that TRPV4 is located in the AJs. By contrast, TRPV3, another heat-sensitive TRP channel expressed in keratinocytes (41Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Science. 2002; 296: 2046-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), did not bind to β-catenin in the membrane fractions (supplemental Fig. S1A) despite its abundant expression in skin. The complex formation was also examined in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, which are known to express TRPV4. Interaction among TRPV4, β-catenin, and E-cadherin was recognized in the membrane fraction (supplemental Fig. S1B). These results indicate that TRPV4 is specifically localized with AJ components at the plasma membrane. Skin from wild-type and TRPV4-deficient mice was used to determine whether the loss of TRPV4 in keratinocytes altered epidermal structure. The latter had a significantly thicker cornified layer (14.0 ± 0.5 μm in the wild-type mice, n = 7, and 19.7 ± 0.7 μm in the TRPV4-deficient mice, n = 7; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2A). Except for the cornified layers, the thickness of the epidermal layers in the two genotypes was indistinguishable (30.8 ± 6.0 μm in the wild-type mice, n = 16, and 29.05 ± 6.1 μm in the TRPV4-deficient mice, n = 16; p = 0.12). There were no obvious differences between wild-type and TRPV4-deficient mice in their expression of several proteins related to cytoskeleton and intercellular adhesion, either at the mRNA or at the protein level (Supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). We pursued the possibility that TRPV4 might affect skin barrier function because the thick cornified layer observed in the TRPV4-deficient skin was similar to the phenotype previously reported in mice lacking either claudin-1 (21Furuse M. Hata M. Furuse K. Yoshida Y. Haratake A. Sugitani Y. Noda T. Kubo A. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 1099-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar) or E-cadherin (22Tunggal J.A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), both of which showed severe damage in the barrier functions. To assess the cornified layer-dependent barrier functions, dye permeation into the skin was examined at the whole animal level. Lucifer yellow did not permeate through the cornified layer in either wild-type or TRPV4-deficient mice (Fig. 2B). Toluidine blue staining of the skin after immersion was indistinguishable between wild-type and TRPV4-deficient mice (Fig. 2C, acetone (−)). These data suggest that the cornified layer-dependent hydrophobic barrier was intact in the TRPV4-deficient skin. We next tested the cell-cell junction-dependent permeability by disrupting the cornified layer with acetone. Dye permeation increased more in TRPV4-deficient than in wild-type mice following aceton"

Why this is the case is unknown. MacLennan et al. (p. 508 ; see the Perspective by Moir and Fauci ) have uncovered a dysregulated antibody response to Salmonella that is the likely culprit. Sera from HIV-infected individuals do a poor job of killing S. Typhimurium, despite surprisingly elevated antibody titers. Experiments showed that HIV-infected serum inhibited the power of normal serum to kill Salmonella . Inhibition was specific to antibodies against lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the cell wall of Salmonella . Hence, HIV-infected sera was able to kill Salmonella strains lacking LPS, and removing LPS immunoglobulin G from infected sera permitted Salmonella killing. Thus, not only does HIV cause defects in cell-mediated immunity but it also seems to impair humoral immunity, with severe consequences for multiple infections."

Furthermore, peak oxidative capacity was higher in the transgenics as compared with control littermates.

https://openalex.org/W2050274888,"Homologous recombination (HR) plays a critical role in facilitating replication fork progression when the polymerase complex encounters a blocking DNA lesion, and it also serves as the primary mechanism for error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks. Rad51 is the central catalyst of HR in all eukaryotes, and to this point studies of human Rad51 have focused exclusively on events occurring within the nucleus. However, substantial amounts of HR proteins exist in the cytoplasm, yet the function of these protein pools has not been addressed. Here, we provide the first demonstration that Rad51 and the related HR proteins Rad51C and Xrcc3 exist in human mitochondria. We show stress-induced increases in both the mitochondrial levels of each protein and, importantly, the physical interaction between Rad51 and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Depletion of Rad51, Rad51C, or Xrcc3 results in a dramatic decrease in mtDNA copy number as well as the complete suppression of a characteristic oxidative stress-induced copy number increase. Our results identify human mtDNA as a novel Rad51 substrate and reveal an important role for HR proteins in the maintenance of the human mitochondrial genome."

Endophilin is a bin/amphiphysin/rvs (BAR) domain protein that induces vesicle formation by promotion of membrane curvature through membrane binding as a dimer. Using site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy, we show that the overall BAR domain structure of the rat endophilin A1 dimer determined crystallographically is maintained under predominantly vesiculating conditions. Spin-labeled side chains on the concave surface of the BAR domain do not penetrate into the acyl chain interior, indicating that the BAR domain interacts only peripherally with the surface of a curved bilayer. Using a combination of EPR data and computational refinement, we determined the structure of residues 63–86, a region that is disordered in the crystal structure of rat endophilin A1. Upon membrane binding, residues 63–75 in each subunit of the endophilin dimer form a slightly tilted, amphipathic α-helix that directly interacts with the membrane. In their predominant conformation, these helices are located orthogonal to the long axis of the BAR domain. In this conformation, the amphipathic helices are positioned to act as molecular wedges that induce membrane curvature along the concave surface of the BAR domain.

The crystal structures of the BAR domains of endophilin and amphiphysin have the striking feature that they adopt curved, banana-shaped dimers, as illustrated for the structure of rat endophilin A1 (5Gallop J.L.

The shapes of these dimers are complementary to that of the curved membranes with which the proteins interact. The concave surfaces of the dimers also have a high density of positively charged residues that are likely to interact favorably with negatively charged membranes, and multiple simultaneous mutations of these residues reduce the membrane interaction (5Gallop J.L.

These data suggest that the concave surface of the BAR domain plays an important role in membrane curvature generation and that it might act as a rigid, positively charged scaffold (5Gallop J.L.

It has become clear that additional regions outside the BAR domain also play important roles in membrane curvature induction. These regions are unstructured in solution and are not resolved in crystal structures, but their removal or mutation can abolish or inhibit liposome binding activity and tubulation (5Gallop J.L.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Using site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy, we have shown that the endophilin N terminus undergoes a structural reorganization from an unfolded state in solution to an amphipathic helix (helix 0) that inserts into the membrane at the level of the head group (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The inserted helix is likely to act as a molecular wedge that creates a strain in the outer leaflet and thereby promotes membrane curvature. Endophilin also has a central region (residues ∼62 to 86) that is disordered in the crystal structure of the rat protein (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) but partly helical (residues 63 to 70) in the crystal structure of the human protein (8Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This region has also been proposed to form a helix that inserts into the membrane (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 17Cui H. Ayton G.S. Voth G.A. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), but detailed experimental evidence is still lacking. A functional role for this region has recently been supported by genetic rescue experiments in Drosophila (18Jung, A. G., Labarerra, C., Jansen, A. M., Qvortrup, K., Wild, K., Kjaerulff, O., PLoS One, 5, e9492.Google Scholar). Here, we investigated the roles of helix insertion and scaffolding by examining the structure of rat endophilin A1 upon vesiculation. Previous work on annexins showed that curvature-dependent membrane interactions can lead to major conformational reorganization of a protein (19Fischer T. Lu L. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9996-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, our first goal was to test whether the overall structure of the endophilin BAR domain is retained upon membrane interaction and, if so, how its concave surface interacts with the membrane. We then investigated the structure of the central insert (residues 64–86) in the membrane-bound protein using site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy. The information obtained was then used in a computational refinement to generate three-dimensional atomistic models of membrane-bound endophilin. Single and double cysteine mutants of rat endophilin A1 were expressed and purified as described previously (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Proteins were reacted with 5× molar excess of the spin label MTSL (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-d-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate, which generates the spin-labeled side chain R1. Unreacted spin label was separated using PD10 columns. Folch fraction I, type I, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Lipids were dried with nitrogen gas and desiccated overnight. They were resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, treated to brief bath sonication, and extruded through 400-nm pore filters using the Avanti mini-extruder. 2 μm spin-labeled protein was combined with 1.4 mg/ml Folch liposomes and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After incubation, unbound proteins were separated from membrane-bound proteins by high speed centrifugation at 152,800 × g for 20 min at 22 °C. EPR spectra were then obtained for the membrane-bound portion and also for samples in the absence of liposomes. Spectra were collected using a Bruker EMX spectrometer fitted with a dielectric resonator at 1.59-mW incident microwave power and a scan width of 100 gauss. Power saturation experiments to determine O2 and NiEDDA accessibility (ΠO2 and ΠNiEDDA, respectively) have previously been described (20Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Accessibility data were obtained using oxygen from air in equilibrium with buffer, and 10 mm NiEDDA. The Φ parameter was calculated by the relationship Φ = ln(Π(O2)/Π(NiEDDA)). The immersion depth was calibrated using 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(n-DOXYL)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) as described previously (20Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We obtained the following relation between immersion depth (d) and Φ: d[Å] = 6.3*Φ − 3.9. This immersion depth represents the depth of the nitroxide moiety. Samples were prepared by combining 4 μm protein and 1.4 mg/ml Folch liposomes. After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 152,800 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was recovered for measurement. The pellet was resuspended in buffer, and 20–25% sucrose was used as cryoprotectant before loading into quartz capillaries. Samples were flash frozen, and data were acquired at 78 K. Four-pulse double electron-electron resonance (DEER) experiments were performed using a Bruker Elexsys E580 X-band pulse EPR spectrometer fitted with a 3-mm split ring (MS-3) resonator, a continuous flow helium cryostat (CF935; Oxford Instruments), and a temperature controller (ITC503S; Oxford Instruments). Data were fit using gaussian distributions, as implemented in the DEERAnalysis2008 package (21Jeschke G. Chechik V. Ionita P. Godt A. Zimmermann H. Banham J. Timmel C.R. Hilger D. Jung H. Appl. Magn. Reson. 2006; 30: 473-498Crossref Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the rat endophilin dimer (Protein Data Bank code 2C08) (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) was used as a starting point for computational refinement based on distance and depth constraints derived from EPR data. A complete description of the details of this procedure is given in the supplemental material. An in-house algorithm (PRONOX) was used to add residues 64–86 to each subunit of the endophilin dimer: add spin labels at positions 63, 66, 70, 73, 74, 75, 77, and 83; locate the starting structure at the surface of an imaginary lipid vesicle; and produce a set of constraints for simulated annealing molecular dynamics (SAMD) calculations. Based on the secondary structure determined by EPR, residues 64–75 were built as helices and constrained using hydrogen-bonding constraints to maintain a helical structure. These constraints, interdimer distance constraints measured from continuous wave EPR and four-pulse DEER EPR, lipid depths for residues 63, 66, and 70, and other system constraints (supplemental Tables S1 and S2) were used in SAMD simulations in AMBER8 (22Case D.A. Darden T.A. Cheatham III, T.E. Simmerling C.L. Wang J. Duke R.E. Luo R. Merz K.M. Wang B. Pearlman D.A. Crowley M. Brozell S. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Mongan J. Hornak V. Cui G. Beroza P. Shafmeister C. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Kollman P.A. AMBER. 8. University of California, San Francisco2004Google Scholar). During these calculations, the helix and loop were not covalently linked to each other or to the BAR domain to allow freedom of movement according to the distance and depth constraints. Sixty cycles of SAMD were performed starting from a conformation with the helical axes approximately orthogonal to the long axis of the BAR domain. The motion of the insert helices (residues 64–75 in each subunit) was monitored by calculation of the angle between the helical axis and the long axis of the BAR domain (see the supplemental material). The lipid vesicle was built as described previously (23Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the BAR domain of the rat endophilin A1 dimer observed crystallographically is retained upon membrane interaction, we generated a series of spin-labeled endophilin derivatives (Fig. 1A) and incubated them with liposomes comprised of Folch lipids. The experimental conditions were chosen such that the Folch liposomes were predominantly vesiculated into highly curved vesicles with an average diameter of ∼ 230 Å, as determined by electron microscopy (supplemental Fig. S1A). We then measured intra- and intersubunit distances and compared them with the respective α-carbon distances of the crystal dimer. The distances measured by EPR are those between the nitroxide moieties of R1, and therefore, they would be expected to be similar but not necessarily identical to the α-carbon distances. Distances >20 Å were investigated using four-pulse DEER (24Altenbach C. Kusnetzow A.K. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar), whereas shorter distances were investigated using continuous wave EPR (28Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The DEER measurements are illustrated with the example of membrane-bound endophilin spin-labeled in helix 3 at position 216 (Fig. 1A). A pronounced periodic oscillation is observed for this 216R1 derivative (Fig. 1B), and frequency analysis of this oscillation yields a well defined distance distribution with a maximum at 37 Å (Fig. 1C). This distance is in good agreement with the respective intersubunit α-carbon distance of 34 Å in the crystal structure of endophilin (Table 1). Similarly, the intradimer distances of membrane-bound 96R1 (in helix 1b), 63R1 (in the helix 1 insert), and the previously reported (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) distance for 227R1 (in helix 3) are in good agreement with the crystal structure (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). As a control, we also measured the intersubunit distance for one of the derivatives (96R1) in solution and obtained the same distance as that for the membrane-bound form (supplemental Fig. S1D).TABLE 1Intra- and intersubunit distances between spin-labeled residues in membrane-bound endophilin measured by EPRMutantEPR distanceCrystal structureÅÅ227R19 (CW)863R19 (CW)1196R138 (DEER)36216R137 (DEER)34166R1-210R143 (DEER)35178R1-200R131 (DEER)33 Open table in a new tab The tip-to-tip distance of the endophilin dimer in the crystal is nearly 130 Å. Because this range is beyond the detection limit for intersubunit contacts, we employed a different approach and measured distances between two sites located toward the tip region in the same subunit. As shown in Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B, the distance of 31 Å between 178R1 and 200R1 (located directly at the tip and in helix 3, respectively) is also in good agreement with the α-carbon distances of the crystal structure (33 Å). It has been found previously that the structures of different families of BAR domain proteins overlay well in the central region but are much more divergent toward the tips or wings (15Henne W.M. Kent H.M. Ford M.G. Hegde B.G. Daumke O. Butler P.J. Mittal R. Langen R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Structure. 2007; 15: 839-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To test for potential movement between the central region and the wing region, we measured the distance between 166R1 and 210R1 (located in helix 2 and 3, respectively). The distance between these residues for membrane-bound endophilin is in good agreement with the expected distance from the crystal structure (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B). Moreover, the same distance was obtained when distances were measured between these residues in solution (supplemental Fig. S1D). Collectively, this distance analysis supports the notion that the overall structure of the BAR domain dimer is largely retained upon membrane interaction. Next, we used mobility and accessibility analysis of selected spin-labeled derivatives to investigate the mechanisms by which the BAR domain interacts with the membrane. Spin labels were introduced at positions that were either located on the concave surface of the BAR domain (positions 96, 159, and 166) or at positions expected to face away from the membrane (positions 108, 172, and 247) (Fig. 1A). The EPR spectra for these derivatives in the soluble (black trace, Fig. 2) and membrane-bound forms (red trace, Fig. 2) are qualitatively similar and consistent with the respective locations in the crystal structure. For example, the EPR spectra for 247R1 (Fig. 2B) are characterized by three sharp and narrowly spaced lines in both conditions. The high motion indicated by these spectra is consistent with the location of this site at the C terminus of a helix that is likely to be frayed in solution. However, some membrane binding-induced immobilization is detected for 159R1 and 166R1. The immobilization observed at those sites could be caused by a direct interaction with the lipids or other regions of the proteins. We note that both sites could be in proximity to the membrane-embedded N-terminal helix 0 or the linker that connects it to helix 1 (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To investigate the proximity of the labeled sites to the membrane bilayer, we used accessibility of the labels to the paramagnetic colliders, O2 and NiEDDA. Although the concentration of the nonpolar O2 increases in the membrane, the more polar NiEDDA preferentially partitions into the solvent. Thus, the deeper a spin label penetrates into the acyl chain region, the more it becomes accessible to O2 and inaccessible to NiEDDA. The accessibilities to O2 and NiEDDA (ΠO2 and ΠNiEDDA) are conveniently summarized by the depth parameter Φ (Φ = ln(ΠO2/ΠNiEDDA). Interestingly, the Φ values for positions 96, 159, and 166 (on the concave face) or 108, 172, and 247 (toward the convex face) were all in the range from −1.2 to −2.1 (Fig. 2). Thus, the depth parameter Φ indicates little membrane penetration by residues on the concave surface of the BAR because the values of Φ do not differ between labels at three such positions and those at solvent-exposed positions. Although these data clearly indicate the lack of significant acyl chain penetration of the nitroxide moiety of the spin-labeled sites, they do not exclude the possibility that the concave surface of endophilin interacts with the interfacial region of the bilayer (see below). To investigate potential membrane-induced conformational changes in the helix insert region, we conducted a nitroxide scanning experiment. The EPR spectra of the soluble derivatives (Fig. 3, black) are generally of higher amplitude with sharper spectral lines than those from the respective membrane-bound forms (Fig. 3, red). Control experiments, in which sucrose was used to slow down the tumbling of the dimer in solution, showed little spectral changes, indicating that the membrane binding-induced change in tumbling rate did not play a significant spectral role (data not shown). The line shapes of 70R1 to 77R1 indicate a largely disordered and unfolded structure in solution, whereas a more ordered structure is induced upon membrane binding. Only residues 64–69 are ordered in solution, and pronounced immobilization can be seen for 64R1, 65R1, 68R1, and 69R1. Such immobilization could be caused by tertiary contacts. This region was largely disordered in the crystal structure of rat endophilin (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) but was resolved in the structure of human endophilin (8Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), in which residues 63–70 were found to form a short helical segment. Moreover, residues 64, 65, 68, and 69 are pointing directly toward the BAR domain in the latter structure. Thus, the EPR spectra in the absence of membranes are consistent with a structure akin to that in the crystal of human endophilin (also see below). Residues 64–69 are also the most ordered region of the membrane-bound form, but in the presence of membranes the ordered region becomes much more extended. To obtain more detailed secondary structure information in the membrane-bound form, we performed O2 and NiEDDA accessibility measurements for 63R1 to 77R1. As summarized with the depth parameter Φ (Fig. 4A), the accessibility data give rise to a periodic oscillation. The local Φ-maxima (residues 63, 66, 70, 73, and 74; magenta) represent preferentially O2 accessible, lipid-exposed sites, and these positions cluster on the hydrophobic face of a helical wheel (Fig. 4B). Conversely, the local minima (green) correspond to solvent-exposed sites that fall onto the opposite face of the helical wheel. The formation of an amphipathic α-helical structure is further supported by a comparison of the Φ-data with a cosine curve that has the standard periodicity of an α-helix (3.6 amino acids/turn). This curve agrees well with the experimentally observed periodicity from residues 63 to 75, but it starts to diverge for residues 76 and 77. For these residues, an increase in the Φ-values would be predicted, but the opposite is observed. Thus, these residues may no longer be part of the helix. Previous studies demonstrated that Φ-values are proportional to the membrane immersion depth of R1 side chains that are penetrating into the acyl chain region. This depth can be calibrated using spin-labeled derivatives of phospholipids (20Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 30Frazier A.A. Wisner M.A. Malmberg N.J. Victor K.G. Fanucci G.E. Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Based on such a calibration (see “Experimental Procedures”), we obtain average immersion depths of the nitroxide moieties of 63R1, 66R1, and 70R1 that are on the order of 5–6 Å. Previous work has shown that an R1 side chain is typically at a distance of 7–10 Å from the center of an α-helix to which it is attached (31Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Thus, we can estimate that the center of the helix is located about 1–4 Å above the phosphate layer. The Φ-values for residues 73 and 74 are somewhat lower, and the reduced immersion depth of these sites is consistent with a slight helix tilt. However, residues 73 and 74 are also located on the periphery of the hydrophobic face (Fig. 4B) where the side chains might project laterally rather than directly toward the bilayer interior. To analyze the orientation of the amphipathic helices with respect to each other, we measured intersubunit distances between the same sites in each subunit using DEER (supplemental Fig. S2). As shown in Table 2, the distance between these sites generally increases with increasing residue number, indicating that the helices must be facing away from each other. This feature is best illustrated with the lipid-exposed sites 63R1, 66R1, and 70R1. For these sites, we can assume that the nitroxide side chains are facing in the same direction (i.e. into the membrane) and that the interlabel distances are likely to be close to those between the respective α-carbon atoms. An interesting feature of the DEER distances is that they increase by about 10 Å for each helical turn, which is in good agreement with antiparallel helices because an individual helix is extended by ∼5 Å/turn. The other distances in Table 2 are also in agreement with a helical structure (also see below).TABLE 2Intramolecular distances between same sites in the insert region of membrane-bound endophilinMutantExperimental distanceÅ63R19 (CW)64R118 (DEER)65R124 (DEER)66R119 (DEER)67R123 (DEER)70R128 (DEER)71R137 (DEER)73R141 (DEER)74R144 (DEER)75R142 (DEER)77R149 (DEER)83R144 (DEER) Open table in a new tab Since Masuda and colleagues (8Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) observed a short antiparallel helical structure for residues 63–71 in the crystal structure of human endophilin A1, we sought to determine whether the distances in solution are similar to those in the membrane-bound form. As shown in supplemental Table S3, the intersubunit distances for 63R1, 67R1, and 70R1 in the absence of membranes differ from those observed in the membrane-bound state. Compared with the α-carbon distances from the crystal structure, the measured distances in solution are in good agreement. These data suggest that the structure of the insert taken up in the crystal of human endophilin A1 is similar to that of rat endophilin A1 in solution and that the structure taken up in the membrane-bound state is different. To generate atomistic models of the membrane-bound form of endophilin, we used the crystal structure of the soluble rat endophilin A1 dimer as a starting structure and built and refined the structure of the insert region (residues 63–86) using a modified version of our previously reported (23Jao C.C. Hegde B.G. Chen J. Haworth I.S. Langen R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 19666-19671Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) SAMD refinement constrained by the EPR results. These calculations included intersubunit constraints based on DEER distances, depth constraints based on EPR accessibility data, constraints to maintain the helicity of the insert region as detected by EPR mobility and accessibility data, and symmetry constraints on the insert regions of the two subunits. The intersubunit constraints were implemented as the mean distance ± 5 Å to reflect the relatively large width of the EPR distance distributions. Endophilin structures were collected at the end of each of 60 SAMD cycles. The insert helices clearly adopted one of three positions with an angle between the helical axis and the long axis of the BAR domain of about 140°, 90 °, and 40°, respectively (supplemental Fig. S3), with 18, 33, and 9 occurrences, respectively, over the 60 SAMD cycles. The three positions of the insert helices are interconvertible, and all may occur in a population of membrane-bound endophilin proteins. This may account for the width of the distance distribution for the intersubunit DEER data. However, in the SAMD cycles shown in supplemental Fig. S3A and in other calculations performed with minor changes in parameters (see the supplemental material), we consistently find that the most common conformation is that with the insert helices orthogonal to the BAR domain axis (green helices in supplemental Fig. S3B). To examine the interaction of the endophilin dimer with a curved lipid surface, we used a representative structure with orthogonal insert helices and constructed part of a lipid vesicle around the protein (Fig. 5). We were able to do this because the predicted structure is positioned in space based on depth constraints relating the center of the lipid vesicle to the protein. Two main findings for the insert helices emerge from the SAMD calculations and subsequent building of the lipid surface. First, the helices (residues 63–75) are tilted such that the N terminus of each helix is located below the phosphate of the lipid head group, whereas the C terminus and the loop (residues 76–86) are positioned above the lipid surface (Fig. 5B). Second, the axes of the helices adopted a staggered position with respect to each other (Fig. 5A). The detailed positions of amino acids 63–75 are shown in Fig. 5C. The amino acid positions obtained by computational refinement using EPR distance, depth and mobility data, and geometrical and symmetry constraints show remarkably good agreement with the predicted orientations based on accessibility data only (Fig. 4). Hence, Ala-63, Ala-66, Met-70, Thr-73, and Met-74 are oriented into or toward the hydrophobic region of the lipids. All of the remaining side chains are positioned above the phosphate head groups and may be considered in three categories. First, Arg-65 and Lys-67 are oriented sideways from the helix and can interact with negative charges on the lipid head groups. Second, three serine residues and Asn-72 are either solvent-exposed or hydrogen-bonded to head groups, and these residues produce an element of amphipathicity in the helix. Third, Leu-68 and Ile-71 are two hydrophobic residues that apparently break this amphipathicity. However, the side chain of Leu-68 forms hydrophobic contacts with Ile-55 and Leu-58 in the BAR domain. This interaction, as well as the interaction between Ile-71 and Tyr-86 may help to stabilize the orthogonal orientation of the insert helices (supplemental Fig. S4). In this study, we investigated the structure of endophilin bound to small and highly curved vesicles. Under these conditions, the BAR domain of endophilin retains a dimeric structure similar to that found in the crystal. This demonstrates that endophilin does not undergo major conformational refolding upon membrane binding, unlike the case of annexin B12 (19Fischer T. Lu L. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9996-10004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, we find that a central insert region (residues 63–75) becomes helical and inserts into the membrane at an immersion depth that is comparable (albeit slightly shallower) to that of the N-terminal helix (5Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The insert helix in each subunit is tilted such that the side chains of Ala-63 and Ala-66 at the N terminus are below the level of the phosphate head groups of the lipid. The position of this helix with respect to the BAR domain is flexible, but seems to adopt a preferential position with the helical axes orthogonal to the BAR domain long axis. The width of the DEER distance distributions for intersubunit distances between residues in the insert helices suggested some structural heterogeneity. This manifested in the computational refinement as three distinct positions with angles of about 140°, 90°, and 40° between the helical axis and the BAR domain. Interestingly, the 40° position is very close to the position adopted by the insert helices in the x-ray structure of human endophilin (8Masuda M. Takeda S. Sone M. Ohki T. Mori H. Kamioka Y. Mochizuki N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In this crystal structure, Arg-65 in the insert helix forms a salt bridge with Glu-56, and a similar salt bridge forms in the 40° structures obtained in our SAMD refinement (supplemental Fig. S5A). In an analogous manner, Lys-67 in the insert helix forms a salt bridge with Glu-56 (in the opposite subunit) in the 140° structures generated in the SAMD calculation (supplemental Fig. S5B), whereas the salt bridge between Arg-65 and Glu-56 (same subunit) is broken. In the orthogonal structures, neither Arg-65 nor Lys-67 is located close enough to Glu-56 in the same or the opposite subunit, and the positives charges are therefore free to interact with the lipid head groups (supplemental Fig. S5C). Thus, a picture emerges of a dynamic helix that that might occupy a range of conformations based on these electrostatically favorable interactions. It appears that the orthogonal orientation should be favorable in the membrane-bound state, but the other orientations of the helix might be accessible to adjust to different membrane and curvature conditions. This behavior and the detailed orientations of the side chains of the helices may be amenable to analysis by theoretical calculations along the lines of those performed previously for membrane-bound endophilin (17Cui H. Ayton G.S. Voth G.A. Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 2746-2753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been suggested by which insertion of amphipathic helices can induce curvature. By inserting helices into only the outer leaflet of the bilayer, an imbalance is created between the two leaflets, and the tighter packing in the outer leaflet causes an expansion that, in turn, leads to bending of the membrane. In addition, insertion of helices at the level of the head groups could induce additional curvature strains by preferentially increasing the packing density in the head group rather than the acyl chain region (32Campelo F. McMahon H.T. Kozlov M.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2325-2339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the case of membrane-inserted amphipathic helices, these mechanisms are expected to promote membrane curvature in a direction perpendicular to that of the helix axis. Thus, the antiparallel insert helices in their most predominant orientation are ideally positioned to induce curvature along the concave surface of the BAR domain. In contrast, the Φ-values for sites labeled on the concave surface of the BAR domain did not indicate penetration into the acyl chain region, and the endophilin BAR domain must, therefore, be positioned farther away from the membrane than its amphipathic helices, Thus, if the concave surface of endophilin interacts with the bilayer, it likely does so by interaction with the more distal portions of the head group. This general behavior is consistent with the model in Fig. 5, in which the BAR domain is docked onto a lipid vesicle according to the immersion depth information obtained for the insert helix. In this model, the BAR domain follows the general shape of the vesicle and is positioned to interact with the outer region of the membrane head groups. Future studies will have to show whether the structural features found under the present lipid conditions will also apply to vesicles of different sizes or to tubules.

These findings demonstrate that E2F1 has a direct, non-transcriptional role in DNA repair involving increased recruitment of NER factors to sites of damage. UV radiation causes several forms of DNA damage, the most prominent of these being the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) 2The abbreviations used are: CPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimer(6–4)PP6–4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproductNERnucleotide excision repairGG-NERglobal genome NERXPxeroderma pigmentosumATRATM and Rad3-related kinaseTopBP1topoisomerase II-binding protein 1ATMataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinaseDSBdouble strand breakNHFnormal human fibroblastATataxia-telangiectasiaDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleCMVcytomegalovirussiRNAsmall interference RNAGFPgreen fluorescent protein. and 6–4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproduct ((6–4)PP). This damage is repaired by the NER pathway, which can be further partitioned into global genome NER (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled repair. Transcription-coupled NER repairs damage in actively transcribed DNA strands, whereas GG-NER is used to repair the majority of damage throughout the genome (1Friedberg E.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 22-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The importance of NER is illustrated by the hereditary syndrome xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), which is caused by mutations in one of several NER genes and characterized by hypersensitivity to sunlight and a strong predisposition to skin cancer. cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer 6–4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproduct nucleotide excision repair global genome NER xeroderma pigmentosum ATM and Rad3-related kinase topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase double strand break normal human fibroblast ataxia-telangiectasia 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole cytomegalovirus small interference RNA green fluorescent protein. The ATR kinase plays a major role in the DNA damage response initiated by UV radiation. Recent studies have shown that single-stranded DNA, which occurs at stalled replication or transcription forks or during the process of NER, constitutes the signal for ATR activation (2Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13213-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 3Hanasoge S. Ljungman M.

ATR is recruited to sites of single-stranded DNA through its association with ATR-interacting protein, which in turn binds to the single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (4Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). ATR is then activated through a physical interaction with topoisomerase II-binding protein 1 (TopBP1), which is independently recruited to sites of damage through an interaction with the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex (5Delacroix S. Wagner J.M. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K. Karnitz L.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28036-28044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Once active, ATR phosphorylates substrates such as Claspin, Chk1, and p53 to promote repair, establish cell cycle checkpoints, or induce apoptosis. ATR and the related ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase also phosphorylate the E2F1 transcription factor on serine 31, a site not conserved in other E2F family members (7Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). E2Fs regulate the expression of numerous genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis and are key determinants of cell fate (8DeGregori J. Johnson D.G. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 739-748PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of E2F1 on serine 31 stimulates binding to 14-3-3τ, which leads to E2F1 stabilization following DNA damage (9Wang B. Liu K. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54140-54152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Serine 31 phosphorylation also creates a binding site for one of the eight BRCA1 C-terminal domains of TopBP1 (10Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TopBP1 binding to E2F1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F1 independent of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor. In addition, TopBP1 binding results in the accumulation of E2F1 at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (10Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In response to agents that cause DSBs, E2F1 stabilization contributes to the induction of apoptosis by transcriptionally activating p73 and perhaps other pro-apoptotic target genes (11Ianari A. Natale T. Calo E. Ferretti E. Alesse E. Screpanti I. Haigis K. Gulino A. Lees J.A. Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 184-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Pediconi N.

In response to UV, however, E2F1 does not transcriptionally activate p73 or promote apoptosis (12Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In fact, we have previously shown that E2F1 has an anti-apoptotic function in response to UV radiation (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Wikonkal N.M. Remenyik E. Knezevic D. Zhang W. Liu M. Zhao H. Berton T.R. Johnson D.G. Brash D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mice lacking E2F1 had higher levels of apoptosis in their epidermis following UV irradiation compared with wild-type mice while transgenic mice overexpressing E2F1 had reduced levels of UV-induced apoptosis. E2F1-mediated survival in response to UV correlated with an effect on DNA repair, which was impaired in the absence of E2F1 and stimulated by E2F1 overexpression (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that E2F1 enhances GG-NER through a novel mechanism that is independent of its function as a transcriptional regulator. Primary dermal normal human fibroblasts (NHF, GM08399), SV40-transformed dermal fibroblasts (GM00637), and primary fibroblasts from ataxia-telangiectasia (AT, GM02052) and Seckel syndrome (ATR-deficient, GM18366) patients were obtained from Coriell Institute. HeLa and HCT116 cells were obtained from ATCC. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta) except HCT116 cells, which were maintained in McCoy's 5A Medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For general UV treatment, UVB was delivered by Westinghouse FS20 sunlamps filtered through cellulose acetate (Kodacel from Kodak, St. Louis, MO) with a wavelength cutoff of 290 nm. Dosimetry was determined with a IL1400 photometer coupled to a SCS 280 probe (International Light, Newburyport, MA). Because filters absorb ∼90% of the UV radiation (15Moné M.J. Volker M. Nikaido O.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it was necessary to use UVC for the co-localization assays, because UVC is more efficient at inducing DNA damage compared with the more physiological relevant UVB radiation. UVC was delivered by Phillips Sterilamp G8T5 bulbs emitting predominantly 254 nm. The dose was measured using an IL-1400A Photometer coupled to SEL 240 detector. Cells were mock treated or treated with 500 J/m2 of UVB, and whole cell lysates were obtained using 1× lysis buffer (Cell signaling). E2F1 antibody-conjugated Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for immunoprecipitation, and the precipitate was analyzed by Western blot using E2F1 or TopBP1 antibodies. Antibodies/antisera were obtained from the following sources: E2F1 (C-20 and KH95), β-tubulin, E2F2, E2F3, and p62, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; CPD and (6–4)PP, MBL; XPA polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; XPA monoclonal (12F5), Lab Vision; and TopBP1, Bethyl Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antisera to the CPD and (6–4)PP photoproducts were developed by Dr. David Mitchell. Co-localization of proteins with UV-induced DNA damage was performed as previously described (15Moné M.J. Volker M. Nikaido O. Mullenders L.H. van Zeeland A.A. Verschure P.J.

Briefly, cells grown on chamber slides (Nunc) were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline leaving a thin layer of buffer on top. Sterile isopore polycarbonate membrane filter (Milipore) containing pores of either 3 or 8 μm in diameter were placed on top of the cells, and the slides were irradiated from above with UVC. The filter was then removed, and cells were incubated for designated time points before a cytoskeleton extraction procedure. After washing, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100. For immunofluorescent staining, fixed cells were incubated with 3% bovine serum albumin, washed, and treated with 2 m HCl for 5 min at 37 °C to denature the DNA. Washed cells were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies (e.g. specific for CPD and E2F1) followed by incubation with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 or Alexa 594, Invitrogen). Cells were then stained with DAPI and sealed in mounting media (Vector Laboratory) with coverslips. The images were captured, digitally recorded, and analyzed using a Nikon eclipse 80i microscope equipped with an X-cite 120 fluorescence illumination system and Metamorph image analysis software. Percent co-localization was determined by scoring 100 randomly selected cells for each experimental group as previously described (15Moné M.J. Volker M. Nikaido O. Mullenders L.H. van Zeeland A.A.

Briefly, cells were mock treated or treated with 500 J/m2 of UVB, then fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were harvested by standard cell lysis buffer and sonicated to shear the DNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed with antibodies against E2F1 or E2F2, and the precipitated DNA was reverse cross-linked and purified. After quantification of the DNA, the amount of UV-induced DNA damage pulled down by the binding proteins was detected by a slot-blot assay. As a control, the same DNA samples were also amplified by PCR for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen promoter, which is both an E2F1 and E2F2 transcriptional target. UV-induced DNA damage was detected as described (19Wani A.A. D'Ambrosio S.M. Alvi N.K. Photochem. Photobiol. 1987; 46: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were treated with 500 J/m2 of UVB and incubated for the designated time periods before isolating genomic DNA using the GenElute kit (Sigma). DNA was quantified, and 0.5 μg of DNA was spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Genemate) using a slot-blot transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). The UV-induced DNA damage was detected by an immunoblot procedure using antibodies against (6–4)PP (1:1000) and CPD (1:2000). The membrane was re-probed with antibody against single-stranded DNA (Chemicon, MAB3034) for loading control. The densities of the bands were quantified by using ImageJ, and the graphs were plotted accordingly after normalization with the loading control. The cDNAs of human E2F1, including the wild-type, serine S31A mutant, DNA binding domain mutant (E138), DP dimerization domain deletion mutant (Δ206–220), Marked box domain deletion mutant (Δ283–358), and C terminus deletion mutant (Δ375–437), were inserted into a p3XFLAG CMV vector (Sigma) at the HindIII/XbaI sites. The cDNAs of wild-type E2F1 and S31A mutant were also inserted into a pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) to generate the green fluorescence protein fused to E2F1. Small interference RNAs (siRNAs) against the human E2F1 coding region (E2F-1 siRNA sc29297: strand 5169, CACCUGAUGAAUAUCUGUA; strand 5170, CCUGAUGAAUAUCUGUACU; and strand 5171, GAGUCUGUGUGGUGUGUAU) and 3′-untranslated region (E2F1 siRNA sc29297 strand 5171 GAGUCUGUGUGGUGUGUAU and E2F1 siRNA sc44258 strand 16661 GCUUUAAUGGAGCGUUAUU) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfections were performed with either Oligofectamine (for primary normal human fibroblasts) or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Because of differences in the steady-state expression levels of the various FLAG-E2F1 mutant proteins, the amounts of each plasmid transfected into cells for the rescue experiments were adjusted as follows: wild type, 2 μg; S31A, 8 μg; E138, 0.5 μg; Δ206–220, 2 μg; Δ283–358, 1 μg; and Δ375–437, 0.5 μg. Among the E2F family, E2F1 is specifically stabilized in response to several types of DNA damage (20Blattner C. Sparks A. Lane D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21O'Connor D.J. Lu X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 22Höfferer M. Wirbelauer C. Humar B. Krek W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and we confirmed this finding in NHFs following UVB irradiation (Fig. 1A). In some settings, E2F1 stabilization in response to DNA damage contributes to the induction of apoptosis (7Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 23Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, we found that mice lacking E2F1 are hypersensitive to UV-induced apoptosis, whereas transgenic expression of E2F1 can suppress apoptosis in response to UV (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Wikonkal N.M. Remenyik E. Knezevic D. Zhang W. Liu M. Zhao H. Berton T.R. Johnson D.G. Brash D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We also found that the inactivation of E2f1 in mice impairs GG-NER and suggested the anti-apoptotic and pro-survival function of E2F1 following UV treatment might be related to this ability to enhance DNA repair (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Given that E2F1 is recruited to sites of DSBs (10Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we examined whether E2F1 might also localize to sites of UV-induced DNA damage using the filtered UV irradiation-coupled immunofluorescence method (15Moné M.J. Volker M. Nikaido O. Mullenders L.H. van Zeeland A.A. Verschure P.J. Manders E.M. van Driel R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Katsumi S. Kobayashi N. Imoto K. Nakagawa A. Yamashina Y. Muramatsu T. Shirai T. Miyagawa S. Sugiura S. Hanaoka F. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Mori T. J. Invest.

Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In this assay, cells are irradiated with UV through a filter and subnuclear regions containing DNA damage are identified using an antibody specific for the CPD DNA photoproduct. Because the filter absorbs most of the radiation, it was necessary to use UVC for these co-localization experiments, because UVC is more efficient than UVB at inducing DNA damage. E2F1 was found to rapidly accumulate at sites of UV-induced DNA damage, before significant E2F1 stabilization, and to remain co-localized with CPD at least 3 h post-irradiation (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the E2F2 and E2F3 proteins did not co-localize with sites of DNA damage after the same filtered UV treatment (Fig. 1C). An E2F1 construct fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) was also found to co-localize with NER factors XPC and p62 after UV irradiation (Fig. 2A). To further confirm our finding that E2F1 associates with damaged DNA, we employed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and found that E2F1 could specifically pull down DNA fragments containing UV-induced damage (Fig. 2B). In contrast, E2F2 did not associate with damaged DNA but did associate with an E2F transcriptional target, the PCNA promoter, as efficiently as E2F1. E2F1 is phosphorylated at serine 31 by the ATM and ATR kinases in response to DNA damage (7Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event is involved in E2F1 stabilization and its localization to sites of DSBs (9Wang B. Liu K. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54140-54152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the ATM and ATR kinases in regulating the response of E2F1 to UV, we examined the co-localization of E2F1 with CPD in NHFs, ATM-deficient human fibroblasts (AT cells), or ATR-deficient Seckel Syndrome fibroblasts. We observed that the localization of E2F1 was significantly decreased by 4-fold in ATR-deficient cells, but not affected in the ATM-deficient cells when compared with NHFs (Figs. 3, A and B). To determine the role of serine 31 in E2F1 localization, plasmids expressing GFP fused to either wild-type or serine 31 (S31A) mutated E2F1 were transfected into HeLa cells followed by filtered UV treatment and immunostaining. Compared with wild-type E2F1, the S31A mutant showed a significantly reduced ability to accumulate at sites of UV damage as indicated by decreased co-localization with the NER protein XPA (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these findings indicate that the ATR-mediated phosphorylation of E2F1 at serine 31 is important for the efficient localization of E2F1 to sites of UV damage. Phosphorylation of E2F1 at serine 31 creates a binding site for one of the BRCA1 C-terminal domains of TopBP1, and this interaction results in the recruitment of E2F1 to sites of DSBs (10Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine if UV radiation would also induce an interaction between E2F1 and TopBP1, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed on endogenous E2F1 and TopBP1 proteins. Although a low level of association was observed in untreated cells, UV treatment resulted in an obvious increase in the ability of E2F1 to co-immunoprecipitation TopBP1 (Fig. 3E). This suggests that, as with DSBs, binding to TopBP1 may be the mechanism by which E2F1 accumulates at sites of UV-induced DNA damage. To determine if E2F1 status affected the recruitment of NER factors to sites of DNA damage, NHFs were transfected with siRNA directed to E2F1 and used in the local UV assay. Depletion of E2F1 did not appreciably affect the expression levels of several NER factors, including DDB1, DDB2/XPE, XPC, p62 (a component of TFIIH), XPF, XPA, and RPA2 (Fig. 4A). However, E2F1 depletion significantly reduced co-localization of XPC, XPA, and p62 with UV damage (Fig. 4, B–E). It was previously shown that XPC is required for the recruitment of all other NER factors to sites of UV damage (17Volker M. Moné M.J. Karmakar P. van Hoffen A. Schul W. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Driel R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings suggest that E2F1 acts upstream of XPC in damage recognition and the recruitment of NER factors. To better understand the function of E2F1 in DNA repair in relation to its other known activities, we performed a series of experiments using a panel of FLAG-tagged E2F1 expression constructs (Fig. 5A). In addition to the S31A mutation, a deletion in the DP dimerization domain also caused defective co-localization of E2F1 with sites of UV damage (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S1). On the other hand, E2F1 mutants in the DNA binding (E138), Marked box (Δ283–358), and C-terminal transactivation (Δ375–437) domains were as efficient as wild-type E2F1 in their abilities to accumulate at sites of UV damage. Thus, direct binding to DNA and interactions with protein partners through the Marked box or C terminus is not required for E2F1 to localize to sites of damage. Dimerization with a DP partner may be important for damage localization, although it is also possible that the Δ206–220 deletion affects another function important for the accumulation of E2F1 at sites of damage. To test the ability of these E2F1 mutants to rescue efficient NER, we first knocked down endogenous E2F1 in HCT116 cells by siRNA directed against the 3′-untranslated region region, which is not retained in the exogenous E2F1 expression constructs. As expected, endogenous E2F1 was efficiently knocked down, whereas the exogenously expressed FLAG-E2F1 was not (supplemental Fig. S2A). Plasmids expressing the different FLAG-E2F1 constructs were then transfected back into the cells (Fig. 5C). Because different E2F1 mutant constructs were expressed at different levels, perhaps due to differences in protein stability, the amount of transfected plasmid encoding different mutants was adjusted. Even so, it was difficult to obtain equal expression levels of the various E2F1 constructs. However, it should be pointed out that all E2F1 constructs were expressed at levels above that of endogenous E2F1 (supplemental Fig. S2A, data not shown). Consistent with our previous findings, the S31A and dimerization domain (Δ206–220) mutants did not rescue the impaired co-localization of XPA with CPD caused by depletion of endogenous E2F1. Although the E2F1 Δ283–358 mutant localized to sites of damage, it also did not rescue the XPA co-localization defect. In sharp contrast, E2F1 mutants in the DNA binding and transactivation domains promoted the recruitment of XPA to sites of damage to the same degree as wild type E2F1 (Fig. 5D and supplemental Fig. S2B). Previously we demonstrated that E2f1 inactivation in mouse cells impaired GG-NER of both (6–4)PP and CPD, although the effect on CPD repair was modest, because this type of lesion is inefficiently repaired in mouse cells. To verify that E2F1 deficiency would inhibit GG-NER in human cells, NHFs were transfected with control or E2F1 siRNA, treated with UV, and the removal of photoproducts from genomic DNA was analyzed by slot blot. As expected, knock down of E2F1 impaired the repair of both (6–4)PP and CPD (Fig. 6A). To examine the ability of the E2F1 mutants to stimulate GG-NER, HCT116 cells were knocked down for endogenous E2F1 and transfected with FLAG-E2F1 constructs as described above. Cells were then exposed to UV and harvested immediately (0 h) or at 6 and 24 h post-irradiation. Genomic DNA was then slot-blotted, and antibody specific for the (6–4)PP was used to estimate the amount of DNA damage in each sample. After quantification of band intensities and normalization with total single-stranded DNA, the percentage of photoproduct removal at 6 and 24 h post-irradiation was calculated (Fig. 6B). Ectopic expression of wild-type E2F1 enhanced the removal of (6–4)PP to a rate that was even faster then mock transfected cells. Consistent with the findings above, the S31A, dimerization domain, and Marked box mutants were unable to stimulate GG-NER, whereas E2F1 mutants in the DNA binding and transactivation domains stimulated the removal of DNA damage as efficiently as wild-type E2F1 (Fig. 6B). Given that the DNA binding and transactivation domain mutants are detective for E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation (24Cress W.D. Johnson D.G. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 6314-6325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), these results strongly suggest that E2F1 enhances GG-NER in a transcription-independent manner. We previously demonstrated that the absence of E2F1 results in inefficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage while E2F1 overexpression stimulates GG-NER (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This may explain how E2F1, which is normally thought of as a pro-apoptotic factor, functions to inhibit apoptosis and increase survival in response to UV radiation (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 14Wikonkal N.M. Remenyik E. Knezevic D. Zhang W. Liu M. Zhao H. Berton T.R. Johnson D.G. Brash D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E2F1 has been implicated in regulating the transcription of several genes encoding DNA repair activities, including DDB2/XPE and XPC (25Lin P.S. McPherson L.A. Chen A.Y. Sage J. Ford J.M. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Polager S. Kalma Y. Berkovich E. Ginsberg D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 27Prost S. Lu P. Caldwell H. Harrison D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3572-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that increased expression of these E2F targets is responsible for the increased NER capacity of cells lacking the retinoblastoma protein (25Lin P.S. McPherson L.A. Chen A.Y. Sage J. Ford J.M. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Prost S. Lu P. Caldwell H. Harrison D. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3572-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Bosco E.E. Knudsen E.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in normal cells containing the retinoblastoma protein, UV treatment results in the transcriptional repression of E2F target genes, at least during the first 10 h after exposure, when E2F1 status has a significant effect on NER (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21O'Connor D.J. Lu X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Lin P.S. McPherson L.A. Chen A.Y. Sage J. Ford J.M. DNA Repair. 2009; 8: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 29Yoshida K. Inoue I. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 6250-6260Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that E2F1 depletion had no observable effect on the expression levels of DDB2, XPC, or several other NER factors. Instead, our finding that E2F1 accumulates at sites of UV damage and promotes the recruitment of NER factors suggests that E2F1 plays a direct role in GG-NER independent of its ability to regulate transcription. The fact that E2F1 domains critical for activating transcription, namely the DNA binding and transactivation domains, are dispensable for stimulating GG-NER strongly supports a non-transcriptional role for E2F1 in DNA repair. The ability of E2F1 to stimulate GG-NER requires serine 31, a site phosphorylated by ATR in response to UV irradiation (7Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). ATR activation occurs when it is recruited to single-stranded DNA coated with replication protein A through an interaction between the ATR dimerization partner ATR-interacting protein and replication protein A (4Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). ATR kinase activity is then stimulated through a direct physical interaction with TopBP1, which is independently recruited to sites of damage though an association with Rad9 of the 9-1-1 complex (5Delacroix S. Wagner J.M. Kobayashi M. Yamamoto K. Karnitz L.M. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1472-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This process likely initiates at replication or transcription forks stalled by DNA lesions and may require additional processing by the NER machinery (2Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13213-13214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Marini F. Nardo T. Giannattasio M. Minuzzo M. Stefanini M. Plevani P. Muzi Falconi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genet. 2008; 17: 3247-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We propose that ATR activation then results in the phosphorylation of E2F1 at serine 31, which stabilizes the interaction between E2F1 and TopBP1 at sites of damage. E2F1 then appears to be involved in a process that enhances damage recognition and NER globally throughout the genome. Several possibilities exist for how E2F1 might enhance damage recognition and GG-NER independent of transcription. It has been demonstrated that E2F1 physically associates with the DDB2/XPE protein (36Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the context of transcription, DDB2/XPE binding stimulates the transcriptional activity of E2F1 (36Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the effect of E2F1 on DDB2/XPE-mediated repair activity has not been addressed, it is possible that E2F1 association could enhance the damage recognition function of DDB2/XPE. A caveat to this potential mechanism is that DDB2/XPE was shown to bind the C terminus of E2F1, which we found is dispensable for the stimulation of NER by E2F1. Another possibility is that E2F1 indirectly promotes the recruitment of NER factors by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes and altering chromatin structure at sites of damage. This mechanism would be analogous to the mechanism used by E2F1 to stimulate transcription. Future experiments will be aimed at identifying the protein partners that work with E2F1 at sites of damage to facilitate DNA repair. ATR function has primarily been studied in the context of cell cycle checkpoint signaling, but our previous studies did not find a cell cycle checkpoint defect in response to UV in cells lacking E2F1 (13Berton T.R. Mitchell D.L. Guo R. Johnson D.G. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2449-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Instead, E2F1 may be added to the growing list of ATR targets directly involved in NER, including XPA and XPC (37Matsuoka S. Ballif B.A. Smogorzewska A. McDonald 3rd, E.R. Hurov K.E. Luo J.

Yang Z. Zou Y. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A recent study suggests that ATR promotes GG-NER only during the S phase, where GG-NER was reported to be less efficient then in other cell cycle phases (40Auclair Y. Rouget R. Affar el B. Drobetsky E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17896-17901Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have demonstrated that the cell cycle phase has no impact on NER efficiency (41Mitchell D.L. Cleaver J.E. Lowery M.P. Hewitt R.R. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 42Wang Y.C. Maher V.M. Mitchell D.L. McCormick J.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 4276-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it may be of interest to determine if the E2F1-dependent effect on GG-NER is cell cycle-regulated. E2F1 can promote or suppress tumor development depending on the experimental context (43Johnson D.G. Degregori J. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The ability of E2F1 to transcriptionally activate genes important for cell proliferation is thought to be responsible for the oncogenic capacity of E2F1. On the other hand, the molecular mechanism by which E2F1 inhibits tumorigenesis remains unclear. Although it was originally assumed that the ability of E2F1 to induce apoptosis was responsible for this activity, more recent experiments demonstrate no correlation between the regulation of apoptosis and tumor suppression by E2F1 (44Rounbehler R.J. Rogers P.M. Conti C.J. Johnson D.G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3276-3281PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that E2F1 stimulates efficient GG-NER and potentially other forms of DNA repair provides another plausible mechanism by which E2F1 could suppress tumor development.

The supercomplex is synthesized in steps during which 12-15 core and 4-9 LHCI subunits are assembled. Here we report the isolation of a PSI subcomplex that separated on a sucrose density gradient from the thylakoid membranes isolated from logarithmic growth phase cells of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Pulse-chase labeling of total cellular proteins revealed that the subcomplex was synthesized de novo within 1 min and was converted to the mature PSI-LHCI during the 2-h chase period, indicating that the subcomplex was an assembly intermediate. The subcomplex was functional; it photo-oxidized P700 and demonstrated electron transfer activity. The subcomplex lacked PsaK and PsaG, however, and it bound PsaF and PsaJ weakly and was not associated with LHCI. It seemed likely that LHCI had been integrated into the subcomplex unstably and was dissociated during solubilization and/or fractionation. We, thus, infer that PsaK and PsaG stabilize the association between PSI core and LHCI complexes and that PsaK and PsaG bind to the PSI core complex after the integration of LHCI in one of the last steps of PSI complex assembly."

https://openalex.org/W2077741678,"Mitomycin C (MMC) is a commonly used and extensively studied chemotherapeutic agent requiring biological reduction for activity. Damage to nuclear DNA is thought to be its primary mechanism of cell death. Due to a lack of evidence for significant MMC activation in the nucleus and for in vivo studies demonstrating the formation of MMC-DNA adducts, we chose to investigate alternative nucleic acid targets. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine changes in mitochondrial gene expression induced by MMC treatment. Although no consistent effects on mitochondrial mRNA expression were observed, complementary results from reverse transcription-PCR experiments and gel-shift and binding assays demonstrated that MMC rapidly decreased the transcript levels of 18S ribosomal RNA in a concentration-dependent manner. Under hypoxic conditions, transcript levels of 18S rRNA decreased by 1.5-fold compared with untreated controls within 30 min. Recovery to base line required several hours, indicating that de novo synthesis of 18S was necessary. Addition of MMC to an in vitro translation reaction significantly decreased protein production in the cell-free system. Functional assays performed using a luciferase reporter construct in vivo determined that protein translation was inhibited, further confirming this mechanism of toxicity. The interaction of MMC with ribosomal RNA and subsequent inhibition of protein translation is consistent with mechanisms proposed for other natural compounds.

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine changes in mitochondrial gene expression induced by MMC treatment. Although no consistent effects on mitochondrial mRNA expression were observed, complementary results from reverse transcription-PCR experiments and gel-shift and binding assays demonstrated that MMC rapidly decreased the transcript levels of 18S ribosomal RNA in a concentration-dependent manner. Under hypoxic conditions, transcript levels of 18S rRNA decreased by 1.5-fold compared with untreated controls within 30 min. Recovery to base line required several hours, indicating that de novo synthesis of 18S was necessary. Addition of MMC to an in vitro translation reaction significantly decreased protein production in the cell-free system. Functional assays performed using a luciferase reporter construct in vivo determined that protein translation was inhibited, further confirming this mechanism of toxicity. The interaction of MMC with ribosomal RNA and subsequent inhibition of protein translation is consistent with mechanisms proposed for other natural compounds."

Chemically oversulfated/modified glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) consisting of heparan sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate have been identified as heparin contaminants. Current studies demonstrated that each component of oversulfated GAGs was comparable with oversulfated chondroitin sulfate in activating the contact system. By testing a series of unrelated negatively charged compounds, we found that the contact system recognized negative charges rather than specific chemical structures. We further tested how oversulfated GAGs and contaminated heparins affect different cell signaling pathways. Our data showed that chemically oversulfated GAGs and contaminated heparin had higher activity than the parent compounds and authentic heparin, indicative of sulfation-dominant and GAG sequence-dependent activities in BaF cell-based models of fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor/c-Ret, and hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met signaling. In summary, these data indicate that contaminated heparins intended for blood anticoagulation not only activated the contact system but also modified different GAG-dependent cell signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1983851548,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a distinctive mode of gene expression utilized by some viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), to produce multiple proteins from a single mRNA. -1 PRF induces a subset of elongating ribosomes to shift their translational reading frame by 1 base in the 5' direction. The appropriate ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol synthesis is tightly regulated by the PRF signal which promotes ribosomes to shift frame, and even small changes in PRF efficiency, either up or down, have significant inhibitory effects upon virus production, making PRF essential for HIV-1 replication. Although little has been reported about the cellular factors that modulate HIV-1 PRF, the cis-acting elements regulating PRF have been extensively investigated, and the PRF signal of HIV-1 was shown to include a slippery site and frameshift stimulatory signal. Recently, a genome-wide screen performed to identify cellular factors that affect HIV-1 replication demonstrated that down-regulation of eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) inhibited HIV-1 replication. Because of the eRF1 role in translation, we hypothesized that eRF1 is important for HIV-1 PRF. Using a dual luciferase reporter system harboring a HIV-1 PRF signal, results showed that depletion or inhibition of eRF1 enhanced PRF in yeast, rabbit reticulocyte lysates, and mammalian cells. Consistent with the eRF1 role in modulating HIV PRF, depleting eRF1 increased the Gag-Pol to Gag ratio in cells infected with replication-competent virus. The increase in PRF was independent of a proximal termination codon and did not result from increased ribosomal pausing at the slippery site. This is the first time that a cellular factor has been identified which can promote HIV-1 PRF and highlights HIV-1 PRF as essential for replication and an important but under exploited antiviral drug target."
https://openalex.org/W2086353001,"Hsp90 requires cochaperone Cdc37 to load its clients to the Hsp90 superchaperone complex. The purpose of this study was to utilize split Renilla luciferase protein fragment-assisted complementation (SRL-PFAC) bioluminescence to study the full-length human Hsp90-Cdc37 complex and to identity critical residues and their contributions for Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction in living cells. SRL-PFAC showed that full-length human Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction restored dramatically high luciferase activity through Hsp90-Cdc37-assisted complementation of the N and C termini of luciferase (compared with the set of controls). Immunoprecipitation confirmed that the expressed fusion proteins (NRL-Hsp90 and Cdc37-CRL) preserved their ability to interact with each other and also with native Hsp90 or Cdc37. Molecular dynamic simulation revealed several critical residues in the two interaction patches (hydrophobic and polar) at the interface of Hsp90/Cdc37. Mutagenesis confirmed the critical residues for Hsp90-Cdc37 complex formation. SRL-PFAC bioluminescence evaluated the contributions of these critical residues in Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction. The results showed that mutations in Hsp90 (Q133A, F134A, and A121N) and mutations in Cdc37 (M164A, R167A, L205A, and Q208A) reduced the Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction by 70-95% as measured by the resorted luciferase activity through Hsp90-Cdc37-assisted complementation. In comparison, mutations in Hsp90 (E47A and S113A) and a mutation in Cdc37 (A204E) decreased the Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction by 50%. In contrast, mutations of Hsp90 (R46A, S50A, C481A, and C598A) and mutations in Cdc37 (C54S, C57S, and C64S) did not change Hsp90/Cdc37 interactions. The data suggest that single amino acid mutation in the interface of Hsp90/Cdc37 is sufficient to disrupt its interaction, although Hsp90/Cdc37 interactions are through large regions of hydrophobic and polar interactions. These findings provides a rationale to develop inhibitors for disruption of the Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction."

Besides the previously demonstrated role of histone deacetylation in the epigenetic repression of BLV expression, we showed here that BLV promoter activity was induced by several DNA methylation inhibitors (such as 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine) and that overexpressed DNMT1 and DNMT3A, but not DNMT3B, down-regulated BLV promoter activity. Importantly, cytosine hypermethylation in the 5′-long terminal repeat (LTR) U3 and R regions was associated with true latency in the lymphoma-derived B-cell line L267 but not with defective latency in YR2 cells.

Interestingly, DNA methylation inhibitors and TaxBLV synergistically activated BLV promoter transcriptional activity in a cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-dependent manner. Mechanistically, methylation at the −154 or −129 CpG position (relative to the transcription start site) impaired in vitro binding of CRE-binding protein (CREB) transcription factors to their respective CRE sites.

The BLV transcriptional promoter is located in the 5′-long terminal repeat (5′-LTR) and is composed of the U3, R, and U5 regions. Transcription initiates at the U3–R junction of the 5′-LTR.

During retroviral infection, the RNA viral genome is retrotranscribed into double-stranded DNA, which becomes integrated into the host genome and is organized into chromatin as all cellular genes. This chromatin environment is likely to be a key parameter for the control of viral gene expression because transcriptional activation by cellular or viral trans-acting factors is dependent on chromatin accessibility. BLV expression is controlled by chromatin structure. Indeed, our laboratory reported previously that histone acetylation is an important epigenetic modification for TaxBLV-dependent and -independent viral transcriptional regulation (26Merezak C.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10309-10314Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BLV promoter activity is induced by deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and this is correlated with an increased histone-4 acetylation at the viral promoter (27Calomme C. Dekoninck A. Nizet S. Adam E.

Our laboratory has also demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors and TaxBLV synergistically activate BLV promoter transcriptional activity in a CRE- and CREB-dependent manner. This synergism is mediated by an HDAC inhibitor indirect action that requires de novo protein synthesis and that increases the level of CREB/ATF bound to the BLV promoter (28Nguyên T.L. Calomme C.

To further investigate the role of chromatin structure in the control of BLV gene expression, we studied in this report the involvement of another epigenetic modification, DNA methylation, in BLV gene expression regulation. The enzymes that establish and maintain specific DNA methylation patterns include the de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B and the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 (30Hermann A. Gowher H. Jeltsch A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2571-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 31Brenner C. Fuks F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 301: 45-66PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, DNA methylation occurs predominantly at cytosines in CpG dinucleotides of transcriptional regulatory regions and is generally associated with gene silencing, either directly by inhibiting the binding of transcription factors to their recognition sequences or indirectly by preventing transcription factors from accessing their target sites through attachment of methyl-CpG-binding proteins, which “read” DNA methylation patterns. These proteins (MeCPs) recruit histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases, thereby resulting in formation of a closed repressive chromatin structure (31Brenner C. Fuks F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2006; 301: 45-66PubMed Google Scholar, 32Latham T. Gilbert N. Ramsahoye B. Cell Tissue Res. 2008; 331: 31-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that DNA cytosine hypermethylation is associated with BLV postintegration latency in a lymphoma-derived B-cell line, L267. Mechanistically, site-specific methylation in BLV promoter CRE elements inhibits CREB/CREM/ATF-1 in vitro binding and decreases by 2-fold BLV LTR-driven transcription. Importantly, by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we have demonstrated in vivo the recruitment of the transcription factors CREB and CREM, and to a lesser extent ATF-1, to the hypomethylated CRE region of the YR2 5′-LTR, whereas we detected no CREB/CREM/ATF recruitment to the hypermethylated corresponding region in the L267 cells. Interestingly, we show that TaxBLV protein decreases the expression levels of DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, which could, at least in part, explain the lower level of DNA methylation observed in the L267LTaxSN 5′-LTR compared with the L267 5′-LTR. These results indicate that DNA methylation contributes to proviral latency, a viral strategy to escape host immune response and allow tumor development.

Chem. 2002; 277: 8775-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All transfection mixtures contained pRL-TK (50 ng), in which a cDNA encoding Renilla luciferase is under the control of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter region and which is used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. At 48 h posttransfection, luciferase activities (firefly and Renilla) were measured in cell lysates by using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Nuclear extracts prepared from transfected Raji cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with an anti-c-Myc (1/1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-40) antibody or with an antibody from Imgenex directed against DNMT1 (IMG-261A), DNMT3A (IMG-268A), or DNMT3B (IMG-184A). A second antibody, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/3000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-2054), was used for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Cell Signaling Technology). Samples of total genomic DNA (700 ng) isolated with the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen) and digested overnight with EcoRI in a volume of 20 μl were prepared for methylation analysis as described previously by Olek et al. (39Olek A. Oswald J. Walter J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 5064-5066Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, the digested DNA, which had been boiled for 5 min, chilled quickly on ice, and incubated in 0.3 m NaOH at 50 °C for 15 min, was mixed with 2.5 volumes of 2% low melting point agarose (SeaPlaque agarose, FMC Bioproducts). Ten-microliter volumes of agarose-DNA mixture were pipetted into 750 μl of chilled mineral oil to form agarose beads. Aliquots of 1 ml of 2.5 m sodium metabisulfite (Sigma) and 125 mm hydroquinone (Sigma) (pH 5.0) were then added to mineral oil containing up to four agarose beads. The reaction mixtures were kept on ice for 30 min and then incubated in the dark at 50 °C for 3.5 h. The agarose beads were equilibrated four times (15 min each time) with 1 ml of Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) and DNA desulfonated in 500 μl of 0.2 m NaOH (twice for 15 min each time) at room temperature. Finally, the beads were washed with 1 ml of Tris-EDTA (pH 8.0) (3 times for 10 min each time) and then with 1 ml of sterile water (twice for 15 min each time) and kept at 4 °C. Bisulfite-treated DNA in melted agarose was amplified by PCR in a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 1× PCR buffer (GoTaq polymerase buffer, Promega, Madison, WI), 1 mm MgCl2, each dNTP at 400 μm, with 1 unit of GoTaq polymerase, and 50 pmol of each primer: NA (5′-TGTATGAAAGATTATGT-3′, nucleotides (nt) −211 to −195, sense) and NB (5′-CATAATATAATTTAAAAAAAAAACCCAAAA-3′, nt 391–420, antisense), primers complementary to the BLV 5′-LTR and Gag-coding region, respectively (Fig. 2C); NE (5′-TAGAAAATGAATGGTTTTTT-3′, nt 7930–7949, sense) and NF (5′- TATTTACCAATCTCTCCTAA-3′, nt 8484–8503, antisense), primers complementary to the X region and the 3′-LTR, respectively (Fig. 2C). The amplification products were subjected to a second round of PCR with nested primers: NC (5′-GATTATGTTGATTTAGGAGT-3′, nt −202 to −183, sense) and ND (5′-AAAATAAATCCAAAAAATTATTAAAATTCC-3′, nt 351–380, antisense), primers complementary to the BLV 5′-LTR and Gag coding regions, respectively (Fig. 2C); NG (5′-GAGGGGGAGTTATTTGTATG-3′, nt 8060–8079, sense) and NH (5′-TATTTACCAATCTCTCCTAACC-3′, nt 8482–8503, antisense), primers complementary to BLV 3′-LTR and X regions, respectively (Fig. 2C). The sense primers contained T and the antisense primers contained A instead of C in positions complementary to nonmethylable C (i.e. C out of CpG dinucleotides). PCR was performed with about 50 ng of genomic DNA (of 140 ng of DNA/1 agarose bead) for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C (45 °C for the 3′-LTR) for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s for the first round of PCR. The second round of PCR was performed with 5 μl from the first round of PCR for 50 cycles at 95 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min (52 °C for the 3′-LTR), and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s. Amplification products were cloned in the TOPO TA cloning vector system (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The frequency of conversion of C to T following the sodium bisulfite treatment and PCR in our studies was greater than 99% at non-CpG sites, indicating the adequacy of the approach. ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (EZ ChIP technology, Upstate). YR2 and L267 cells were cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde. To detect chromosomal flanking regions, pellets were sonicated (Bioruptor sonicator) to obtain DNA fragments at an average size of 400 bp. Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed with an antibody directed against CREB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-186), CREM (sc-440), ATF-1 (sc-243), and ATF-2 (sc-242). To test aspecific binding to the beads, a purified IgG was used as a control for immunoprecipitation (Vector Laboratories, catalog number I-1000). Quantitative PCR reactions were performed with the MESA GREEN qPCR MasterMix (Eurogentec). Relative quantification using standard curve method was performed for each primer pair, and 96-well optical reaction plates were read in an Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 7300 real-time PCR instrument (absolute quantification method). Fold enrichments were calculated as percentages of input values following this formula: Immunoprecipitated DNA/total DNA. Primer sequences used for quantification in a region overlapping the three CRE sites of the BLV LTR (Fw, 5′-GCCAGAAAAGCTGGTGACG-3′ and Rv, 5′-GGGTGTGGATTTTTCGGG-3′) and in the U5 region of the BLV LTR, where no CRE binding site has been reported (Fw, 5′-CCTCTGACCGTCTCCACGT-3′ and Rv, 5′-AAGTAAGACAGGAAACAAGCGC-3′), were designed using the software Primer Express 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells using a rapid protocol described by Osborn et al. (40Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). All buffers contained the following protease inhibitors: antipain (10 μg/ml), aprotinin (2 μg/ml), chymostatin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford methodology (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (24Calomme C. Nguyen T.L. de Launoit Y. Kiermer V. Droogmans L. Burny A. Van Lint C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8775-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The DNA sequences of the coding strand of TxRE1 and TxRE2 probes (nt −164 to −144 and nt −139 to −119, respectively) were as follows: 5′-CAGACAGAGACGTCAGCTGCC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGGTGACGGCAGCTGGT-3′ (the CRE sites are underlined, and the CpG dinucleotides are highlighted in boldface type). Methylated versions of these oligonucleotides (where CpGs at positions −154 (located within the CRE1 site) or −129 (located within the CRE2 site) were methylated) were synthesized chemically by Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) and named TxRE1-154me (Fw, 5′-CAGACAGAGACMeGTCAGCTGCC-3′; Rv, 5′-GGCAGCTGACMeGTCTCTGTCTG-3′) and TxRE2–129me (Fw, 5′-AAGCTGGTGACMeGGCAGCTGGT-3′; Rv, 5′-ACCAGCTGCCMeGTCACCAGCTT-3′). The eukaryotic expression vector pSG-TaxBLV was a kind gift from Drs. Richard Kettmann and Luc Willems (Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium). The eukaryotic pcDNA3.1/Myc-His-derived expression vectors for DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (pCMV-Myc-Dnmt1, pDNMT3aMyc, and pDNMT3bMyc, respectively) were kind gifts from Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2060712874,"Prestin is a member of the SLC26 family of anion transporters that is responsible for outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility. Measures of voltage-evoked charge density (Q(sp)) of prestin indicated that the protein is highly expressed in OHCs, with single cells expressing up to 10 million molecules within the lateral membrane. In contrast, charge density measures in transfected cells indicated that they express, at best, only a fifth as many proteins on their surface. We sought to determine whether associations with other OHC-specific proteins could account for this difference. Using a yeast two-hybrid technique, we found microtubule-associated protein 1S (MAP1S) bound to prestin. The interaction was limited to the STAS domain of prestin and the region connecting the heavy and light chain of MAP1S. Using reciprocal immunoprecipitation and Forster resonance energy transfer, we confirmed these interactions. Furthermore, co-expression of prestin with MAP1S resulted in a 2.7-fold increase in Q(sp) in single cells that was paralleled by a 2.8-fold increase in protein surface expression, indicating that the interactions are physiological. Quantitative PCR data showed gradients in the expression of prestin and MAP1S across the tonotopic axis that may partially contribute to a previously observed 6-fold increase in Q(sp) in high frequency hair cells. These data highlight the importance of protein partner effects on prestin."

Zinc ions were shown to enhance activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation but down-regulate the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. The protein C pathway plays a key role in blood coagulation and inflammation. At present there is no information on whether zinc modulates the protein C pathway. In the present study we found that Zn2+ enhanced the binding of protein C/activated protein C (APC) to endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR) on endothelial cells. Binding kinetics revealed that Zn2+ increased the binding affinities of protein C/APC to EPCR. Equilibrium dialysis with 65Zn2+ revealed that Zn2+ bound to the Gla domain as well as sites outside of the Gla domain of protein C/APC. Intrinsic fluorescence measurements suggested that Zn2+ binding induces conformational changes in protein C/APC. Zn2+ binding to APC inhibited the amidolytic activity of APC, but the inhibition was reversed by Ca2+. Zn2+ increased the rate of APC generation on endothelial cells in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+ but did not further enhance increased APC generation obtained in the presence of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ with Ca2+. Zn2+ had no effect on the anticoagulant activity of APC. Zn2+ enhanced APC-mediated activation of protease activated receptor 1 and p44/42 MAPK.

Calcium is an obligatory cofactor in the initiation and regulation of blood coagulation. All vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins have calcium-binding sites and thus presumably could interact to some degree with other divalent cations.

At present, there is no information on whether Zn2+ binds to protein C/APC and how this affects protein C/APC binding to EPCR and their subsequent functions. The data presented in this manuscript show that Zn2+ binds to protein C/APC, induces conformational changes in the protein, promotes protein C/APC binding to EPCR and thereby enhances the activation of protein C and APC-mediated cell signaling. Protein C, factor Va, factor Xa, prothrombin, and thrombin were obtained from either Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN) or Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Recombinant APC (Xigris) was from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). The γ-carboxyglutamic acid domainless form of protein C (GD-protein C) was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. GD-APC was prepared by digesting APC with chymotrypsin as described earlier (26Esmon N.L. DeBault L.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5548-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant hirudin was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Chromogenic substrates for APC (S-2366) and thrombin (Chromozym TH) were obtained from Diapharma Group, Inc. (West Chester, Ohio) and Roche Applied Science, respectively. Mouse monoclonal anti-EPCR antibodies (JRK-1494 and JRK-1500) were kindly provided by Charles T. Esmon (Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation). Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from Lonza (Walkersville, MD). Monolayers of HUVEC were grown to confluency at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator in EBM-2 basal medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and growth supplements (Lonza). Endothelial cell passages between 3 and 8 were used in the present studies. Wild-type CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and CHO-K1 cells stably transfected with full-length human EPCR cDNA (CHO-EPCR) (27Ghosh S. Pendurthi U.R. Steinoe A.

Protein C and other ligands were labeled with 125I using IODO-GEN (Thermo Scientific Pierce Research Products, Rockford, IL)-coated polypropylene tubes and Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (27Ghosh S.

To evaluate the effect of zinc ions on the binding of protein C and APC to EPCR, HUVEC or CHO-EPCR cells were first incubated with control vehicle or anti-EPCR antibodies (JRK-1494) in buffer A+ (10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 11 mm d-glucose, pH 7.5 (buffer A) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at room temperature for 30 min. The monolayers were then chilled on ice followed by incubation for 3 h at 4 °C with 125I-protein C or 125I-APC (80 nm) in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnCl2 (0–100 μm) ± 5 mm CaCl2. At the end of the incubation period, the supernatant was removed from the wells, and the cells were washed four times with ice-cold buffer A containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 5 mm CaCl2 (buffer B) to remove unbound radiolabeled ligand. The monolayers were then incubated with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.3, for 5 min to elute the surface-bound radiolabeled ligand, and the eluted radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding measured in the presence of anti-EPCR antibodies was subtracted from the total binding (binding observed in the absence of anti-EPCR antibodies) to calculate EPCR-specific binding. In general, nonspecific binding of protein C and APC is much lower (20% or less of the total binding) in CHO-EPCR cells compared with HUVEC (40–50%). For internalization studies, CHO-EPCR were incubated at 37 °C with 125I-APC (10 nm) in buffer A+ containing 25 μm Zn2+ or 5 mm Ca2+ alone or in combination. At varying time intervals, the surface-associated ligand was eluted as described above, and the cells were extracted with lysis buffer (0.1 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS); both eluted and solubilized radioactivity were measured to quantify cell surface-associated and internalized APC. To study the effect of zinc ions on EPCR mAb binding to EPCR, CHO-EPCR cells were incubated with varying concentrations of 125I-labeled EPCR mAb (JRK-1500; 0–100 nm) with 5 mm Ca2+ in the presence or absence of 25 μm ZnCl2 for 3 h at 4 °C. At the end of incubation, the bound radioactivity was eluted and measured as described above. Because very little nonspecific binding was noted with EPCR mAb, no attempts were made to measure the nonspecific binding. APC was labeled with AF546 (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided with the labeling kit. HUVEC cultured on glass coverslips were incubated with AF546-APC (50 nm) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Zn2+. At the end of 1 h of incubation, the unbound ligand was removed, and the cells were fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. The cells were viewed with an Axio ObserverZ1 microscope using 63× (oil) plan-apochromate lens. The images were acquired from a field of view at 0.5-μm z axis increments using the LSM 510 Meta confocal system (Carl Zeiss). The laser wavelength settings were 543 ± 10 nm for excitation and 575 ± 10 nm for emission. All of the images were obtained using identical gain and off-set settings for the detector. The images were processed using LSM Zen 2007 (Zeiss) software and imported to Adobe Photoshop (versus 7.0) for the compilation of figures. Endothelial cells grown to confluence in a 96-well plate were incubated with protein C (80 nm), CaCl2 (5 mm), varying concentrations of ZnCl2 (0–100 μm), and thrombin (2 nm) in a total volume of 50 μl. At the end of 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, 25 μl of hirudin (4 units/ml) was added to the cells to neutralize thrombin. Ten minutes after adding hirudin, 25 μl of chromogenic substrate S-2366 (0.5 mm) was added to the well, and the change in absorbance at 405 nm (milli-optical density/min) was measured using a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA). All of the concentrations listed were final concentrations. A standard curve generated with known concentrations of APC was used to determine the concentrations of APC generated in the reaction mixture. Under these experimental conditions, APC generation was dependent on protein C binding to EPCR and thrombin binding to thrombomodulin because preincubation of HUVEC with either anti-EPCR or anti-thrombomodulin antibodies (25 μg/ml) markedly attenuated APC generation. For Km and Vmax determinations, the activation assays were performed with increasing concentrations of protein C (0.05–2.0 μm) in the presence of 1.1 or 5 mm CaCl2 ± 25 μm ZnCl2 and/or 0.6 mm MgCl2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Other conditions for the assay were the same as above. To examine the effect of Zn2+ on the amidolytic activity of APC, APC or GD-APC (10 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of zinc ions (0 to 200 μm) ± Ca2+ (1.1 mm) for 5 min, and then the chromogenic substrate S-2366 was added to the reaction mixture. The rate of hydrolysis was monitored by measuring the change in the absorbance of the chromogenic substrate at 405 nm in a microplate reader. APC (200 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of Zn2+ (0–100 μm) for 20 min, and then APC at final concentration of 1 nm was added to HUVEC monolayers preincubated with FVa (2 nm) in a 96-well culture plate. After allowing APC to inactivate FVa for 30 min, the remaining FVa activity was measured in a prothrombinase assay by adding FXa (5 nm) and prothrombin (1.4 μm) to the monolayers and measuring the rate of thrombin generation in a chromogenic assay using Chromozym TH. Under these experimental conditions, APC inhibited the prothrombinase activity by 50%, and any changes in APC anticoagulant activity were readily detectable in FVa-dependent thrombin generation. The AP-PAR1 reporter plasmid, in which alkaline phosphatase (AP) was fused to the N terminus of PAR1, was constructed as described earlier (28Ludeman M.J. Kataoka H. Srinivasan Y. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13122-13128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and subcloned into an adenoviral vector. The high titer adenoviral particles were purified using ViraBindTM adenovirus purification kit (Cell Biolabs), and the viral titer was determined by QuickTiterTM adenovirus immunoassay kit (Cell Biolabs). HUVEC cultured in a 12-well plate were transduced with AP-PAR1 reporter adenoviral construct (20 multiplicity of infection/cell). In this assay, activation of AP-PAR1 releases the N-terminal peptide with the AP tag into the overlying conditioned medium, and thus the AP activity in the supernatant correlates with the extent of PAR1 activation. HUVEC monolayers expressing AP-PAR1 were treated with APC (80 nm) in the absence or presence of varying divalent cations. Aliquots (40 μl) were removed immediately after the addition of APC (0 time) and after the 45-min activation period. The aliquots were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm to remove any cell debris, and AP activity in the supernatant (15 μl) was quantified using a chemiluminescence substrate from the BD Biosciences Great EscAPe SEAP detection kit. Confluent monolayers of HUVEC were serum-starved for 3 h and then treated with APC (20 nm) for 15 min in the presence or absence of Zn2+. To minimize potential interference of a direct effect of Zn2+ on p44/42 MAPK activation, Zn2+ was added to the cells during serum starvation, i.e. 3 h before the cells were exposed to APC. The cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with phospho-specific and total p44/42 MAPK antibodies (Cell Signaling), and the blot was developed with chemiluminescence. Zinc binding to APC and GD-APC was determined by equilibrium dialysis using 65Zn2+ (specific activity, 1.13 mCi/mmol; Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN) and a 96-well equilibrium dialyzer (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). One hundred μl of protein (7.5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were added to one side of the dialysis cell; 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing varying concentrations of 65Zn2+ (5–200 μm) were added to the other side of cell. The dialyzer was rotated continuously for 24 h at room temperature using a plate rotator. After 24 h, a 50-μl aliquot from each side of the cell was withdrawn and counted for radioactivity. The difference between 65Zn2+ in the protein chamber and that in the protein-free chamber was taken to be a measure of the amount of Zn2+ bound to the protein. Control experiments, where the protein was replaced with Tris buffer, gave equal amounts of 65Zn2+ radioactivity in both chambers, confirming that equilibrium between the two sides of the cell had been established. Control experiments also revealed no significant 65Zn2+ binding to the dialysis membrane. Binding of Zn2+ or Ca2+ to protein C and protein C derivatives was evaluated by changes in the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins associated with the binding of these metal ions to the proteins. The fluorescence titration was carried out using a Spectroflurometer FP 6500 (Jason Inc., Easton, MD). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 295 and 345 nm, respectively. The titrations were carried out at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer by adding small aliquots (0.5–1.25 μl) of Ca2+ (0–5.0 mm) or Zn2+ (0–100 μm) to a 1 μm protein sample (250 μl) and measuring the emission spectra (λem, 300–400 nm) at an excitation maxima of 295 nm. The peak value at the emission wavelength of 345 nm was used to determine the extent of fluorescence quenching. We investigated the effect of zinc ions on the interaction of protein C and APC with EPCR on cell surfaces as the first step in evaluating the potential role of Zn2+ in modulating protein C and APC functions. HUVEC were incubated with 125I-protein C and varying concentrations of ZnCl2 in the presence or absence of Ca2+, and the amount of the radioligand bound to EPCR was measured. As shown in Fig. 1A, Zn2+ enhanced protein C binding to EPCR by 2-fold in reaction mixtures that also contained saturating concentrations of Ca2+. Concentrations of zinc at levels comparable with those in plasma (∼20–25 μm) were sufficient to maximally enhance protein C binding to EPCR. At higher concentrations of zinc ions (100 μm), the enhancing effect of zinc ions was diminished. In the absence of Ca2+, only trace amounts of protein C were associated with the cells, and the addition of Zn2+ only slightly enhanced this base level of protein C binding. To determine whether zinc ions had a similar enhancing effect on APC binding to EPCR, we also evaluated APC binding to endothelial cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, zinc ions increased APC binding to endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. The data obtained with CHO-EPCR cells further confirmed the effect of zinc ions on protein C and APC binding to EPCR (Fig. 1, C and D). The effect of zinc ions on APC binding to EPCR appears to be more pronounced than their effect on protein C binding to EPCR. To investigate whether Zn2+ could induce protein C binding to EPCR independent of the Gla domain, we next examined the effect of Zn2+ on the binding of Gla domain-deleted protein C (GD-protein C) to EPCR on endothelial cells. GD-protein C bound poorly to EPCR, and Zn2+ was ineffective in promoting the binding (data not shown). To examine how the Ca2+ concentration might influence the Zn2+-mediated protein C/APC binding to EPCR, we tested the effect of a fixed concentration of Zn2+ (25 μm) on APC binding to EPCR in the presence of varying concentrations of calcium ions. As shown in Fig. 1E, in the absence of Ca2+, zinc ions failed to mediate APC binding to EPCR. However, a Ca2+ concentration as low as 0.5 mm was sufficient to elicit a marked enhancing effect of Zn2+ on APC binding to EPCR. The zinc effect reached a maximum at 2.5 mm Ca2+. Even in the presence of saturating concentrations of Ca2+, Zn2+ significantly increased APC binding to EPCR. Earlier studies showed that physiological levels of Mg2+ enhanced APC binding to EPCR (29Fukudome K. Kurosawa S. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. He X. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17491-17498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated the effect of Zn2+ ions on protein C and APC binding to EPCR in the absence and presence of a physiological concentration of Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 2A, Mg2+ enhanced the binding of protein C to CHO-EPCR cells by ∼3-fold. Zn2+ increased protein C binding to CHO-EPCR cells to the same extent. The presence of both Mg2+ and Zn2+ increased the binding of protein C to CHO-EPCR cells slightly but significantly (p < 0.01) over that observed in the presence of either Mg2+ or Zn2+ alone (Fig. 2A). The effect of Zn2+ is more pronounced on APC binding to EPCR. Mg2+ enhanced the binding of APC to CHO-EPCR cells by ∼2-fold (Fig. 2B). In the same experiment, physiological concentrations of Zn2+ enhanced the binding of APC to CHO-EPCR cells by ∼7-fold. The addition of a physiological concentration of Mg2+ did not further enhance APC binding to the cells. Similar enhancing effects of Zn2+ and Mg2+ on the binding of APC and protein C were also noted with HUVEC, but the amount of APC and protein C bound to HUVEC, as expected, was much lower than that observed with CHO-EPCR cells (data not shown). The effect of Zn2+ on the enhancement of protein C or APC binding to EPCR on cell surfaces could be the result of increased availability of EPCR receptors on cell surfaces upon exposure to zinc ions or of increased avidity of protein C and APC with bound Zn2+ to EPCR. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we first evaluated the effect of zinc ions on the binding affinity of protein C and APC to HUVEC and CHO-EPCR cells. Zinc ions markedly influenced the binding affinity of protein C and APC to EPCR (Fig. 3). In the absence of zinc ions, both protein C and APC bound relatively poorly to EPCR. The addition of zinc ions to the binding reaction mixture increased the binding affinity of both protein C and APC to EPCR by 5–10-fold. The effect of zinc on APC binding to EPCR, compared with that on protein C binding to EPCR, is more pronounced (Kd for APC in the absence of zinc ions, 117 ± 27 nm; Kd for APC in the presence of zinc ions, 9.3 ± 3.3 nm; Kd for protein C in the absence of zinc ions, 96 ± 26 nm; Kd for protein C in the presence of zinc ions, 21.4 ± 6.6 nm). The Bmax of protein C and APC binding to EPCR on endothelial cells did not differ significantly. Binding studies carried out with CHO-EPCR cells further confirmed that Zn2+ increases the affinity of protein C and APC binding to EPCR. Data analysis showed a 4- and 8-fold increase in the affinity of protein C and APC binding to EPCR, respectively, in the presence of zinc (data not shown). We next investigated the effect of zinc ions on EPCR mAb binding to EPCR. No detectable differences were observed in EPCR mAb binding to EPCR in the presence or absence of zinc ions. The binding curves are hyperbolic and overlapping and yielded essentially the same Kd and Bmax values (data not shown), suggesting that Zn2+ had no direct effect on EPCR on the cell surface. We next examined whether the Zn2+-mediated increase in APC and protein C binding to EPCR on cell surfaces leads to increased internalization of the ligand. CHO-EPCR cells were incubated with 125I-APC (10 nm) in the presence or absence of 25 μm Zn2+ and/or 5 mm Ca2+ at 37 °C for varying time periods. As expected, APC bound to CHO-EPCR in a time-dependent and hyperbolic fashion. 4–5-fold more APC was bound to CHO-EPCR cells when both Ca2+ and Zn2+ were present compared with the amount of APC bound to the cells in the presence of calcium ions alone (Fig. 4A). APC internalization reflected the APC binding properties, i.e. internalization of APC was increased in reaction mixtures containing both Ca2+ and Zn2+ in comparison with the reaction mixture that contained either Ca2+ or Zn2+ alone (Fig. 4B). Although Mg2+ also enhanced the internalization of APC, it was significantly lower than that noted with Zn2+ (Fig. 4C). The presence of Mg2+ with Zn2+ did not further increase the internalization of APC (Fig. 4C). Similar findings were noted with protein C internalization (data not shown). The extent of Zn2+-mediated increase in APC internalization correlates well with the amount of APC bound to EPCR in the presence of Zn2+ (compare Fig. 4C with Fig. 2B), suggesting that the increased internalization of protein C/APC in the presence of Zn2+ stems from the increased association of protein C/APC to EPCR in the presence of Zn2+ and is not the result of an increase in the rate of internalization of the bound ligand. Additional radioligand binding studies performed with HUVEC confirmed the data obtained with CHO-EPCR cells, i.e. significantly more APC was internalized in t"
