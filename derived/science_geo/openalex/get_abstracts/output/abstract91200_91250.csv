https://openalex.org/W2013679718,"After infection and a prolonged incubation period, the scrapie agent causes a degenerative disease of the central nervous system in sheep and goats. Six lines of evidence including sensitivity to proteases demonstrate that this agent contains a protein that is required for infectivity. Although the scrapie agent is irreversibly inactivated by alkali, five procedures with more specificity for modifying nucleic acids failed to cause inactivation. The agent shows heterogeneity with respect to size, apparently a result of its hydrophobicity; the smallest form may have a molecular weight of 50,000 or less. Because the novel properties of the scrapie agent distinguish it from viruses, plasmids, and viroids, a new term ""prion"" is proposed to denote a small proteinaceous infectious particle which is resistant to inactivation by most procedures that modify nucleic acids. Knowledge of the scrapie agent structure may have significance for understanding the causes of several degenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W1507671215,"Metallothionein purified from the livers of rats injected with CdCl3 was cleaved by proteolysis into a 32-residue polypeptide that contained 4 bound Cd ions. Appearance of this fragment designated alpha requires prior treatment of metallothionein with EDTA to remove the Zn ions and destabilize the 3-metal cysteine cluster in the other domain. The half-molecule domain was not efficiently produced by proteolysis of native metallothionein. The Cd4-alpha fragment is asymmetric in shape, as is the parent molecule. NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the alpha fragment starts at Lys 30. Since the same amino acids are released from the COOH terminus of intact thionein and the alpha fragment by carboxypeptidase Y, the alpha domain generated by digestion with subtilisin therefore comprises residues 30 through 61. The amino acid composition of the alpha polypeptide is consistent with the structure of the 4-metal cysteine cluster proposed by Otvos and Armitage ((1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 7094-7098). Metallothionein appears to consist of a 3-metal cysteine domain in the NH2-terminal half of the thionein molecule and the 4-metal cysteine domain in the COOH-terminal half."

The metabolites were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and two epoxides, 11(12)oxido-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid and 14(15)oxido-5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid, were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hepatic cytochromes P-450 purified from rabbits and rats treated with phenobarbital metabolized arachidonic acid to these two epoxides, as well as 5(6)oxido-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid and 8(9)oxido-5,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid and the corresponding vic-diols as the major products. Cytochromes P-450 purified from rabbits and rats treated with beta-naphthoflavone mainly formed (omega-1)- and omega-hydroxylated arachidonic acids, while the four epoxides and the vic-diols were formed in small amounts. Synthetic [14C]14(15)oxido-, 11(12) oxido-, 8(9)oxido-, and 5(6)oxidoeicosatrienoic acid were enzymatically converted to vic-diols by hepatic and renal cortical microsomal and cytosolic fractions and by purified liver microsomal epoxide hydrolase. Liver microsomes oxygenated the epoxides to many polar products in the presence of NADPH. All eight trihydroxy acids, formed by omega- or (omega-1)-hydroxylation of the four vic-diols, four vic-diol dicarboxylic acids, and other metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry."

https://openalex.org/W2008935426,"Scytonema hofmanni, a filamentous freshwater cyanobacterium (blue-green alga), produces secondary metabolites which inhibit the growth of other cyanobacteria and green algae. A rapid, qualitative assay for this inhibition has been developed with Synechococcus as the test organism. This assay procedure has led to the isolation and characterization of an antibiotic (named cyanobacterin) from Scytonema. The antibiotic has a molecular weight of 430 and an empirical formula of C23H23O6Cl and contains a γ-lactone and a chlorinated aromatic nucleus. It inhibits the growth of various algae but has limited effect on nonphotosynthetic bacteria or protozoans and thus may have potential use as a specific algicide."

https://openalex.org/W1542378293,"Glycine N-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.20) has been purified to homogeneity from rat liver. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 132,000 by sedimentation equilibrium method. This value is in good agreement with a value of 130,000 obtained by Sephadex G-150 chromatography. The molecular weight of the denatured enzyme as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is 31,500. The numbers of peptides obtained by tryptic digestion and by cyanogen bromide cleavage are one-fourth of those expected from the contents of lysine plus arginine residues and methionine residues, respectively. By Edman degradation, phenylthiohydantoin-leucine is the only amino acid derivative released from the enzyme. Neither sugar nor phospholipid is detected in the purified preparation. These data indicate that the rat liver glycine N-methyltransferase is a simple protein consisting of 4 identical subunits. The enzyme has an isoelectric pH of 6.4, and is most active at pH 9.0. From the circular dichroism spectrum, an alpha helix content of about 11% is calculated. Whereas the initial velocity as a function of glycine concentration gives a Michaelis-Menten kinetics, the enzyme shows a positive cooperativity with respect to S-adenosylmethionine. The concentrations of glycine and S-adenosylmethionine which give a half-maximum velocity are 0.13 mM and 30 microM, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1555122393,"Xanthine dehydrogenase was purified more than 1500-fold from crude extracts of wild type Drosophila melanogaster. Like the bovine milk and chicken liver enzymes, the purified Drosophila enzyme was inactivated by cyanide, and the cyanide-inactivated desulfo enzyme was reactivated by anaerobic incubation with 1 mM sulfide and 1 mM dithionite. Application of the resulfuration procedure to crude extracts of Drosophila ma-l flies which slow pleiotropic deficiencies of xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde oxidase, and pyridoxal oxidase led to the emergence of xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase activities. Representatives of all the five known complementation groups of ma-l mutants were amenable to activation; 59-95% of wild type xanthine dehydrogenase activity and 1-7% of wild type aldehyde oxidase activity were reconstituted. Evidence for the identity of in vitro reconstituted xanthine dehydrogenase from ma-l mutants with wild type enzyme is presented. Since the inactive xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase proteins present in ma-l mutants are identical with the catalytically inactive desulfo forms obtained by cyanide treatment of active enzymes, these data constitute evidence for genetic control of the incorporation of the cyanolyzable sulfur of Mo hydroxylases."
https://openalex.org/W1512156562,"A soluble, cytochrome P-450-dependent fatty acid hydroxylase-epoxidase isolated from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581 can be induced about 28-fold by the addition of phenobarbital (8 mM) to the growth medium. Phenobarbital is not a substrate for the enzyme nor does it activate the monooxygenase in the cell-free system. The level of the P-450-dependent monooxygenase activity in cultures harvested during the early stationary phase of growth increased linearly with phenobarbital concentration up to its solubility limit (8 mM) at 35 degrees C. The time course of induction during culture growth in the presence of 4 mM phenobarbital showed an interesting dichotomy. The specific content of cytochrome P-450 increased until the early stationary phase of growth and then leveled off. P-450-dependent monooxygenase activity, however, continued to increase rapidly to midstationary phase and then decreased just as rapidly after this time. At maximum specific activity, a turnover number of about 2,450 was obtained for palmitoleate hydroxylation-epoxidation by the cytochrome P-450 system."
https://openalex.org/W1563586057,"The phycocyanin-containing segments of the rod substructures of Anabaena variabilis phycobilisomes consist of complexes of phycocyanin with linker polypeptides of 27,000 and 32,500 daltons (Yu, M.-H., Glazer, A. N., and Williams, R. C. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 13130-13136). Complexes (alpha beta)3.27,000, (alpha beta)3.32,500, (alpha beta)6.27,000, [(alpha beta)6.32,500]n, (alpha beta)6.27,000 - (alpha beta)6.32,500 were prepared, where alpha beta represents a monomer of phycocyanin, and 27,000 and 32,500 represent the 27,000- and 32,500-dalton polypeptides, respectively. Tryptic digestion of (alpha beta)3.32,500 leads to a stable (alpha beta)3.28,000 complex which does not form higher aggregates. The 32,500 polypeptide is stable to trypsin in the [(alpha beta)6.32,500]n and (alpha beta)6.27,000 - [(alpha beta)6.32,500]n=1.2 aggregates. Upon trypsin treatment of all 27,000 still assembled into higher aggregates, (alpha beta)6.21,0900 and (alpha beta)6.21,000 - (alpha beta)6.32,500. The spectroscopic properties of phycocyanin-linker polypeptide complexes were not modified by the tryptic cleavages. These results show that the 32,500 polypeptide has two distinct functional domains, a 28,000 portion necessary to the stabilization of a trimeric phycocyanin complex and a 4,500 domain which links consecutive phycocyanin hexamers in the rod substructure. The 27,000 polypeptide likewise has two distinct functional domains: a 21,000 domain stabilizes a trimeric phycocyanin complex, a 6,000 domain is exposed in all of the assembly forms examined. From these and earlier studies, it is concluded that the 6,000 domain functions in the attachment of the rod substructures to the core of the phycobilisome."

A heavy chain-specific full-length complementary DNA clone has been constructed with the use of messenger RNA from a hybridoma that produces antibodies to the arsonate hapten and bears nearly a full complement of the determinants comprising the cross-reactive idiotype (CRI). The sequences of both the complementary DNA clone and the corresponding immunoglobulin heavy chain have been independently determined. A probe for the variable region gene was prepared from the original heavy chain complementary DNA clone and used to analyze, by Southern filter hybridization, genomic DNA from both A/J (CRI positive) and BALB/c (CRI negative) mice. Approximately 20 to 25 restriction fragments containing ""germline"" variable region gene segments were detected in both strains, and many are shared by both, Since 35 CRI-positive heavy chains have been partially sequenced thus far and 31 are different, the results of the hybridization analysis suggest that somatic mutation events involving the variable region gene segments of the heavy chain play a role in the origin of the amino acid sequence diversity seen in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2035385783,"The hormone ecdysterone induces a characteristic sequence of changes in puffing activity in the salivary gland chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster. A few puffs are induced very rapidly by the hormone and a larger number are only active after a lag period of several hours. To study the interrelationship of the activities of these ""early"" and ""late"" puffs, genotypes aneuploid for two early puffs have been constructed. In the duplication genotype the early puffs are active for less time than in the euploids while in the deficient genotype they are active for a longer period. Under appropriate assay conditions duplication of the early puffs results in a greater and more rapid response of some, but not all, late puffs to the hormone. Deletion of the early puffs results in a delayed response of the same late puffs. These data support the idea that the early puffs are autoregulated and that their products control activity at some late puff sites."

The purification used homogenized fly heads and consisted of polyethylene glycol precipitation, DEAE-Bio-Gel A chromatography, Octyl-Sepharose chromatography, and affinity chromatography using solid phase Green A-agarose. The molecular weight of the native enzyme, as determined by molecular exclusion chromatography, was approximately 67,000 daltons. The final enzyme preparation showed two major protein bands at 67,000 and 54,000 daltons on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After molecular exclusion chromatography, both SDS gel bands were present in the single symmetrical peak that contained the enzyme activity. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps prepared from the individual SDS gel bands indicated that they have very similar primary structures. Both SDS gel bands were precipitated by two different monoclonal antibodies derived against Drosophila choline acetyltransferase activity. The structural and immunological relatedness of the two SDS gel bands indicates that the enzyme is essentially homogeneous and that, in the native state, it may consist of more than one polypeptide chain."

Infection rates and transmission rates were determined after the midge had engorged on patients with viremia. The threshold titer necessary to enable infection or transmission by the midges was approximately 5.3 log10 of the median lethal dose of the virus in suckling mice per milliliter of blood. Transmission was achieved 6 to 12 days after C. paraensis had taken the infective blood meal. This represents conclusive evidence of transmission of an arbovirus of public health importance to man by a member of the Ceratopogonidae family."

https://openalex.org/W1551098723,"Bloodstream forms of the African trypanosomes undergo antigenic variation in their mammalian host. This process involves removal of the existing variant coat protein and its replacement with another. The mechanism by which the surface coat protein is released to the external supporting medium has been shown to depend in vitro specifically on the presence of calcium ions together with the calcium ionophore. A-23187, and to be inhibited by Zn2+. Release of the surface coat protein was not stimulated by conditions designed to alter the plasma membrane potential or the major ionic gradients across that membrane. Release could be stimulated by inhibiting the energy metabolism of these glycolysing cells with 2-deoxyglucose, which probably prevents the energy-dependent mechanisms that normally keep the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration low. These results and the finding that the release process was strongly temperature dependent suggested the possible mediation of some as yet undefined enzymatic reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2167594720,"Within each nephron of the mammalian kidney, a feedback mechanism operating between the macula densa segment of the distal tubule and the afferent arteriole participates in the regulation of glomerular filtration rate. Retrograde microperfusion studies in rats were conducted to test the hypothesis that activation of macula densa cytoplasmic calcium is involved in the transmission of feedback signals to the vascular elements. Perfusion into distal tubules with a hypotonic solution (70 milliosmolar) elicited moderate decreases in glomerular pressure of 6 +/- 0.8 millimeters of mercury. With the addition of a calcium ionophore (A23187) glomerular pressure decreased by 16 +/- 1.1 millimeters of mercury. When a solution devoid of calcium but containing A23187 was used, the feedback response was inhibited. Thus, cytoplasmic calcium within the receptor cells may participate in the transmission of feedback signals to the contractile cells."

Stimulation of the respiratory burst in human neutrophils by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) caused a decline in highly fluorescent cells (characteristic of resting neutrophils) and a corresponding increase in the number of weakly fluorescent cells (characteristic of activated neutrophils). Increasing concentrations of TPA caused increasing numbers of cells to shift from the highly fluorescent population to the weakly fluorescent population without the appearance of intermediate populations. Thus the neutrophil respiratory burst, a component of neutrophil cytotoxic response, is triggered in an all-or none fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1480193945,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) may act to stimulate prolactin secretion by increasing the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration. This notion is supported by the finding that TRH acutely enhances 45Ca2+ efflux from pituitary cells which may reflect alterations in Ca2+ influx or efflux, or both. To differentiate among these possibilities, we measured loss and uptake of nonradioactive Ca2+ by GH3 cells, a cloned strain of rat pituitary cells that produce prolactin, during TRH action using the metallochromic indicator arsenazo III. Cells were perfused in medium containing 2.8 microM Ca2+ and nonradioactive Ca2+ was measured in the perfusion effluent. Under these conditions, there was a sustained loss of Ca2+ from the cells for at least 30 min. TRH caused a transient, marked increase in the amount of Ca2+ released into the medium which occurred in parallel with enhancement in 45Ca2+ efflux and stimulation of prolactin secretion. There was no measurable decrease in Ca2+ concentration in the medium at the onset of the TRH effect which would have been consistent with Ca2+ influx into the cells. Furthermore, an identical response to TRH was observed in cells perfused with medium containing 50 microM verapamil, an agent which blocks Ca2+ influx. In static incubations performed in parallel, TRH caused a decrease in total cellular Ca2+ of 23 +/- 5%. These data provide direct evidence that TRH causes loss of Ca2+ from GH3 cells without causing measurable Ca2+ uptake and support the contention that TRH acts by mobilizing Ca2+ from a sequestered cellular pool (or pools)."

https://openalex.org/W1549642967,"In view of removing lesions in DNA produced by the deamination of cytosine to uracil, uracil-DNA glycosylases were anticipated to be ubiquitous. However, an analogous activity in Drosophila melanogaster was not detected. Instead, a nuclease was identified that acts specifically upon DNA containing uracil. The cleavage of uracil-containing DNA by the nuclease generates acid-soluble oligonucleotides in a reaction which can be inhibited by pretreatment of the DNA with Escherichia coli uracil-DNA glycosylase. Uracil-containing DNA with either A:U base pairs or G:U base pairs were susceptible to cleavage by the nuclease, whereas other damaged DNA substrates were not. The nuclease activity is transient and appears only in third instar larvae, with other developmental stages of Drosophila lacking significant levels of the nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1568781746,"We have begun studying the role of membrane lipids in the exocytotic release process using the pheochromocytoma clone, PC12. The phospholipid fatty acid composition of the cells was modified by growth in the presence of specific fatty acids. None of the fatty acid modifications affected K+-stimulated release of [3H] norepinephrine. This observation indicates that the individual steps of the secretion process, including the extent of depolarization produced by K+, the response of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels to depolarization, and the subsequent steps in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis were unaffected by the fatty acid changes. In contrast, exocytosis evoked by stimulation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors with carbamylcholine or direct activation of action potential Na+ channels with veratridine was diminished in cells enriched with unsaturated fatty acids. The diminished output of the release systems was observed at all concentrations of carbamylcholine and veratridine tested. Since the events of exocytosis subsequent to Ca2+ influx were unaffected by unsaturated fatty acids, it appears likely that the magnitude of the depolarization produced by carbamylcholine and veratridine was reduced. The loss of carbamylcholine-stimulated release did not correlate with the simple presence of the fatty acids, but paralleled closely the time and concentration-dependent changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition. However, when oleate and arachidonate were simultaneously added to the culture medium, the inhibitory effects on carbamylcholine-stimulated release were additive, whereas the changes in fatty acid composition were antagonistic. Thus, exposure of PC12 cells to unsaturated fatty acids causes specific, reversible decreases in the activities of at least 2 stimulus/secretion systems. However, the mechanistic explanation for these changes is not readily apparent from a simple analysis of total phospholipid fatty acid composition."

The enzyme activity was not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. The purified enzyme was a glycoprotein in nature, having a Stokes radius of about 55 A, a sedimentation coefficient of about 8.2 s, and an isoelectric point of about 6.4. Minimum molecular weight of the enzyme was about 108,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas the product cross-linked with glutaraldehyde or dimethyl suberimidate had Mr approximately equal to 220,000, suggesting that the active enzyme existed as a dimer of identical subunits.

The specific stimuli which activate synthesis and the cellular source in the lung remain undefined. In order to study pulmonary thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis, a cultured lung cell model has been used. Monolayer cultures of human diploid embryonic lung fibroblast (WI-38) metabolized exogenously supplied [14C]arachidonic acid to TXA2 as well as prostaglandin E2. Both were unequivocally identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Cellular phospholipids were labeled by preincubating cultures overnight with [14C]arachidonic acid. Release of thromboxane A2 into the culture fluid from these prelabeled cultures was stimulated by two phospholipase activating agents, mellitin and the calcium ionophore A23187. The lung cells also released TXA2 and prostaglandin in a dose-dependent fashion when treated with thrombin but not when exposed to trypsin. Bradykinin, an anaphylactic mediator in vivo, was a potent TXA2 releasing agent in this in vitro system whereas histamine was inactive. In addition, anaphylactic shock perfusates from guinea pig lung were shown to contain a factor (other than bradykinin) which activates fibroblasts TXA2 synthesis in these cultured lung cells. These experiments indicate that the lung fibroblast is probably a source of pulmonary thromboxane in vivo and that the cultured lung cell system described here is a useful model for defining the complex interactions of mediators of anaphylaxis and asthma."

Pulse-chase experiments were carried out to clarify the process of the biosynthesis of DNA polymerase beta. We have attempted to detect a precursor polypeptide which would be expected to have the following properties: 1) a polypeptide which is specifically precipitated by the antibody and has a molecular weight different from 40,000, 2) the amount of the 35S-labeled polypeptide decreases in the chase period, and 3) 35S-labeled polypeptide which is eliminated from the immunoprecipitate by adding an excess amount of purified unlabeled DNA polymerase beta.

A Mr = 40,000 polypeptide was immunoprecipitated from the extract of 30-min pulse-labeled cells and its amount did not change in a 5-hr chase, then decreased.

Under conditions that favor full activation of the enzyme, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum is completely inactivated by BrAcNH-pentitol-P2 in a pseudo-first order process. A rate saturation is observed with a minimal inactivation half-life of 38 min and Kinact for reagent of 0.38 mM. The competitive inhibitor 2-carboxyribitol 1,5-bisphosphate reduces the rate of inactivation, and kinetic analyses are consistent with the protection reflecting true competition of inhibitor and reagent for the same site. As shown with isotopically labeled reagent, complete inactivation is associated with covalent incorporation of 1.1 mol of reagent/mol of subunit. Based on reversibility of inactivation by thiolysis and based on analysis of labeled products in acid hydrolysates of the modified enzyme, a methionyl sulfonium salt is the reaction product. In the absence of CO2 and Mg2+ (ligands required for activation), the enzyme is resistant to BrAcNH-pentitol-P2, which suggests that the site-specific modification of a methionyl residue requires a fully functional catalytic center."

Purification methods included sequential acid extractions of washed spermatozoa at pH 4.0, pH 3.5, and pH 2.5 followed by successive gel filtrations of the pH 2.5 sperm extract supernatant over Sephadex G-75 and G-50. The resulting 8.8-fold purified materials were judged to be homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, had an estimated molecular weight of 12,800, and a constant specific activity of 65 units/mg. Treatment with the proteinases acrosin, trypsin, or chymotrypsin destroyed the highly purified proacrosin conversion inhibitor, indicating that it is a protein. Additional properties of the inhibitor included stability to long periods of storage at pH 3.0 and 4 degrees C, stability to boiling and lyophilization, and an absolute requirement for divalent cations to maintain activity. The highly purified proacrosin conversion inhibitor does not inhibit acrosin. Therefore, it apparently acts to prevent proacrosin conversion by selectively inhibiting the zymogen's self-catalyzed conversion mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1573773124,"The dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex catalyzes a reversible reaction between acetyl-CoA and dihydrolipoamide that results in the formation of S-acetyldihydrolipoamide. We have used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate this reaction using exogenous forms of dihydrolipoamide in place of the protein-bound substrate. With substrate levels of dihydrolipoamide and enzymatically generated [1-13C]acetyl-CoA, both 6-S-[1-13C]acetyl- and 8-S-[1-13C]acetyldihydrolipoamide were formed in the transacetylation reaction and both species participated in the reverse reaction to yield [1-13C]acetyl-CoA and free dihydrolipoamide. The 8-S-acetyl derivative was the principal product. It is suggested that acetylation of both the 6- and 8-thiols of dihydrolipoamide results as a consequence of intramolecular migration following acetylation at a single site. After longer periods of reaction, some 6,8-S,S-[1-13C]diacetyldihydrolipoamide also accumulated. We have also found that [1-13C]acetyl-CoA reacts slowly with dihydrolipoamide in a nonenzymatic reaction to yield the two monoacetylated and some diacetylated derivative. In the reverse reaction catalyzed by the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, it was clear that monoacetyl derivatives were depleted much more rapidly than the diacetyl derivatives, although we could not quantitate the change in the low concentration of the diacetyl derivative."

https://openalex.org/W1482195474,"Five diastereoisomeric cyclopentane-1,2,3-triol monophosphate analogues of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate have been studied as substrates and inhibitors of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.18) of rabbit skeletal muscle. Of the five analogues, only two were substrates, DL-1,2,3/0-1P (analogue I) and DL-1,2/3-1P (analogue II). The rest were weak competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Initial rate kinetic studies of the substrate-active analogues analyzed by a rapid equilibrium random-order mechanism showed that Ks (I) = 4.6 +/- 2.6 mM; Ks (II) = 2.2 +/- 0.6 mM compared with Ks (DL-glycerol-3-P) = 2.4 +/- 0.9 mM. Correlation of the structures of the five analogues with their activities indicates that the enzyme requires a syn orientation of the carbon-oxygen bonds about C-2 and C-3 for activity, which is optimized by an anti relationship between the hydroxyl groups at C-1 and C-2 of the cyclopentanetriol monophosphates. These results are used to deduce the conformation of sn-glycerol-3-P as it is bound in the active site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1570237960,"Pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase which contains two subunits of 240,000 daltons each has been treated with elastase. This treatment yields four protein fragments which can be separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-gel electrophoresis. After the subunit protein has been treated with elastase, all of the partial enzyme activities catalyzed by the complex are present, but enzyme activity for fatty acid synthesis is lost. The formation of protein fragments during proteolysis has been followed by densitometric scanning of the SDS gels. The results of these scans have suggested that (a) there are two peptide components present in the highest molecular weight band, (b) both are rapidly digested to yield the second and third largest peptides, and (c) a further cleavage of the third largest peptide gives rise to the smallest of the four major peptides. Crossed-rocket immunoelectrophoretic analysis of the four protein fragments has confirmed these conclusions and established also that the three smallest peptides are homogeneous. Each of the four peptides has been isolated by preparative SDS-gel electrophoresis, and antibody to one has been prepared. This antibody fraction immunotitrates overall fatty acid synthetase activity and immunoprecipitates the native enzyme. Immunoelectrophoresis of the four elastase-digested synthetase products against this antibody showed some cross-reactivity with a peptide that was neither the precursor nor the product of the immunogen. This cross-reacting antibody was removed by reaction with the nonrelated protein to yield antibody specific for one region of the fatty acid synthetase complex."
