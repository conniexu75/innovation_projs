https://openalex.org/W1968955229,"Background Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1-like cytokine ligand for the IL-1 receptor-related protein ST2, that activates mast cells and Th2 lymphocytes, and induces production of Th2-associated cytokines in vivo. We initially discovered IL-33 as a nuclear factor (NF-HEV) abundantly expressed in high endothelial venules from lymphoid organs, that associates with chromatin and exhibits transcriptional regulatory properties. This suggested that, similarly to IL-1α and chromatin-associated cytokine HMGB1, IL-33 may act as both a cytokine and a nuclear factor. Although the activity of recombinant IL-33 has been well characterized, little is known yet about the expression pattern of endogenous IL-33 in vivo. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that IL-33 is constitutively and abundantly expressed in normal human tissues. Using a combination of human tissue microarrays and IL-33 monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, we found that IL-33 is a novel nuclear marker of the endothelium widely expressed along the vascular tree. We observed abundant nuclear expression of IL-33 in endothelial cells from both large and small blood vessels in most normal human tissues, as well as in human tumors. In addition to endothelium, we also found constitutive nuclear expression of IL-33 in fibroblastic reticular cells of lymphoid tissues, and epithelial cells of tissues exposed to the environment, including skin keratinocytes and epithelial cells of the stomach, tonsillar crypts and salivary glands. Conclusions/Significance Together, our results indicate that, unlike inducible cytokines, IL-33 is constitutively expressed in normal human tissues. In addition, they reveal that endothelial cells and epithelial cells constitute major sources of IL-33 in vivo. Based on these findings, we speculate that IL-33 may function, similarly to the prototype ‘alarmin’ HMGB1, as an endogenous ‘danger’ signal to alert the immune system after endothelial or epithelial cell damage during trauma or infection."

https://openalex.org/W2167369293,"Pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis—an inflammatory disease of the kidneys— may be triggered by bacterial infection. Kain et al. show that almost all individuals with this disease have auto-antibodies to the membrane protein LAMP-2. These antibodies cross-react with the bacterial adhesion FimH, and immunization with FimH causes disease in rats. Pauci-immune focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis (FNGN) is a severe inflammatory disease associated with autoantibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens (ANCA). Here we characterize autoantibodies to lysosomal membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) and show that they are a new ANCA subtype present in almost all individuals with FNGN. Consequently, its prevalence is nearly twice that of the classical ANCAs that recognize myeloperoxidase or proteinase-3. Furthermore, antibodies to LAMP-2 cause pauci-immune FNGN when injected into rats, and a monoclonal antibody to human LAMP-2 (H4B4) induces apoptosis of human microvascular endothelium in vitro. The autoantibodies in individuals with pauci-immune FNGN commonly recognize a human LAMP-2 epitope (designated P41–49) with 100% homology to the bacterial adhesin FimH, with which they cross-react. Rats immunized with FimH develop pauci-immune FNGN and also develop antibodies to rat and human LAMP-2. Finally, we show that infections with fimbriated pathogens are common before the onset of FNGN. Thus, FimH-triggered autoimmunity to LAMP-2 provides a previously undescribed clinically relevant molecular mechanism for the development of pauci-immune FNGN."
https://openalex.org/W1964690949,"Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate has been associated with SNPs in the IRF6 gene. Now Jeff Murray and colleagues report the identification of a common variant in a previously unknown IRF6 enhancer that shows strong evidence of association with cleft lip only and disrupts the binding site of transcription factor AP-2α. Previously we have shown that nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P)1 is strongly associated with SNPs in IRF6 (interferon regulatory factor 6)2. Here, we use multispecies sequence comparisons to identify a common SNP (rs642961, G>A) in a newly identified IRF6 enhancer. The A allele is significantly overtransmitted (P = 1 × 10−11) in families with NSCL/P, in particular those with cleft lip but not cleft palate. Further, there is a dosage effect of the A allele, with a relative risk for cleft lip of 1.68 for the AG genotype and 2.40 for the AA genotype. EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrate that the risk allele disrupts the binding site of transcription factor AP-2α and expression analysis in the mouse localizes the enhancer activity to craniofacial and limb structures. Our findings place IRF6 and AP-2α in the same developmental pathway and identify a high-frequency variant in a regulatory element contributing substantially to a common, complex disorder."

https://openalex.org/W1968619308,"Infectious entry of human papillomaviruses into their host cells is an important step in the viral life cycle. For cell binding these viruses use proteoglycans as initial attachment sites. Subsequent transfer to a secondary receptor molecule seems to be involved in virus uptake. Depending on the papillomavirus subtype, it has been reported that entry occurs by clathrin- or caveolin-mediated mechanisms. Regarding human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16), the primary etiologic agent for development of cervical cancer, clathrin-mediated endocytosis was described as infectious entry pathway.Using immunofluorescence and infection studies we show in contrast to published data that infectious entry of HPV16 occurs in a clathrin- and caveolin-independent manner. Inhibition of clathrin- and caveolin/raft-dependent endocytic pathways by dominant-negative mutants and siRNA-mediated knockdown, as well as inhibition of dynamin function, did not impair infection. Rather, we provide evidence for involvement of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) in HPV16 endocytosis. Following cell attachment, HPV16 particles colocalized with the tetraspanins CD63 and CD151 on the cell surface. Notably, tetraspanin-specific antibodies and siRNA inhibited HPV16 cell entry and infection, confirming the importance of TEMs for infectious endocytosis of HPV16.Tetraspanins fulfill various roles in the life cycle of a number of important viral pathogens, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, their involvement in endocytosis of viral particles has not been proven. Our data indicate TEMs as a novel clathrin- and caveolin-independent invasion route for viral pathogens and especially HPV16."
https://openalex.org/W2022753721,"Doug Epstein and colleagues present biochemical and transgenic studies implicating Six3 in the regulation of Shh forebrain expression through direct binding to a remote enhancer. The work was driven by the discovery of a rare variant in this enhancer in an individual with holoprosencephaly In humans, SHH haploinsufficiency results in holoprosencephaly (HPE), a defect in anterior midline formation1,2. Despite the importance of maintaining SHH transcript levels above a critical threshold, we know little about the upstream regulators of SHH expression in the forebrain. Here we describe a rare nucleotide variant located 460 kb upstream of SHH in an individual with HPE that resulted in the loss of Shh brain enhancer-2 (SBE2) activity in the hypothalamus of transgenic mouse embryos. Using a DNA affinity-capture assay, we screened the SBE2 sequence for DNA-binding proteins and identified members of the Six3 and Six6 homeodomain family as candidate regulators of Shh transcription. Six3 showed reduced binding affinity for the mutant compared to the wild-type SBE2 sequence. Moreover, Six3 with HPE-causing alterations failed to bind and activate SBE2. These data suggest a direct link between Six3 and Shh regulation during normal forebrain development and in the pathogenesis of HPE."
https://openalex.org/W2078544167,"Extracellular adenosine has been implicated as anti-inflammatory signaling molecule during acute lung injury (ALI). The main source of extracellular adenosine stems from a coordinated two-step enzymatic conversion of precursor nucleotides via the ecto-apyrase (CD39) and the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73). In the present study, we hypothesized a critical role of CD39 and CD73 in mediating pulmonary neutrophil (PMN) transmigration during lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced lung injury. Initial studies revealed that pulmonary CD39 and CD73 transcript levels were elevated following LPS exposure in vivo. Moreover, LPS-induced accumulation of PMN into the lungs was enhanced in cd39(-/-) or cd73(-/-) mice, particularly into the interstitial and intra-alveolar compartment. Such increases in PMN trafficking were accompanied by corresponding changes in alveolar-capillary leakage. Similarly, inhibition of extracellular nucleotide phosphohydrolysis with the nonspecific ecto-nucleoside-triphosphate-diphosphohydrolases inhibitor POM-1 confirmed increased pulmonary PMN accumulation in wild-type, but not in gene-targeted mice for cd39 or cd73. Finally, treatment with apyrase or nucleotidase was associated with attenuated pulmonary neutrophil accumulation and pulmonary edema during LPS-induced lung injury. Taken together, these data reveal a previously unrecognized role for CD39 and CD73 in attenuating PMN trafficking into the lungs during LPS-induced lung injury and suggest treatment with their soluble compounds as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2143686770,"Eukaryotic GCN5 acetyltransferases influence diverse biological processes by acetylating histones and non-histone proteins and regulating chromatin and gene-specific transcription as part of multiprotein complexes. In lower eukaryotes and invertebrates, these complexes include the yeast ADA complex that is still incompletely understood; the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetylase) complexes from yeast to Drosophila that are mostly coactivators; and the ATAC (Ada Two-A containing) complex, only known in Drosophila and still poorly characterized. In contrast, vertebrate organisms, express two paralogous GCN5-like acetyltransferases (GCN5 and PCAF), which have been found so far only in SAGA-type complexes referred to hereafter as the STAGA (SPT3-TAF9-GCN5/PCAF acetylase) complexes. We now report the purification and characterization of vertebrate (human) ATAC-type complexes and identify novel components of STAGA. We show that human ATAC complexes incorporate in addition to GCN5 or PCAF (GCN5/PCAF), other epigenetic coregulators (ADA2-A, ADA3, STAF36, and WDR5), cofactors of chromatin assembly/remodeling and DNA replication machineries (POLE3/CHRAC17 and POLE4), the stress- and TGFβ-activated protein kinase (TAK1/MAP3K7) and MAP3-kinase regulator (MBIP), additional cofactors of unknown function, and a novel YEATS2-NC2β histone fold module that interacts with the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and negatively regulates transcription when recruited to a promoter. We further identify the p38 kinase-interacting protein (p38IP/FAM48A) as a novel component of STAGA with distant similarity to yeast Spt20. These results suggest that vertebrate ATAC-type and STAGA-type complexes link specific extracellular signals to modification of chromatin structure and regulation of the basal transcription machinery."
https://openalex.org/W2033528471,"Using a positional cloning approach supported by comparative genomics, we have identified a previously unreported gene, EYS, at the RP25 locus on chromosome 6q12 commonly mutated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa. Spanning over 2 Mb, this is the largest eye-specific gene identified so far. EYS is independently disrupted in four other mammalian lineages, including that of rodents, but is well conserved from Drosophila to man and is likely to have a role in the modeling of retinal architecture."

We determined whether the AMPK γ3 subunit has a role in signaling pathways that mediate mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. We provide evidence that overexpression or ablation of the AMPK γ3 subunit does not appear to play a critical role in defining mitochondrial content in resting skeletal muscle.

AMP-activated protein kinase mitochondrial DNA extensor digitorum longus 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid wild type myosin heavy chain AMP-activated protein kinase mitochondrial DNA extensor digitorum longus 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid wild type myosin heavy chain AMPK is a cellular energy sensor that is activated in response to an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio. Once activated, AMPK coordinates signaling events to initiate catabolic processes that increase energy production and terminate anabolic processes, such as protein synthesis. AMPK activation modulates transcription of specific genes involved in energy metabolism, thereby exerting long term metabolic control. AMPK exists as a heterotrimeric complex composed of a catalytic (α) and two regulatory (β and γ) subunits. The α- and β-subunits are each encoded by two genes (α1, α2, β1, and β2), and the γ subunit is encoded by three genes (γ1, γ2, and γ3), yielding 12 possible heterotrimeric complexes. In human skeletal muscle, only three (α1β2γ1, α2β2γ1, and α2β2γ3) of the 12 AMPK complexes are present (12Wojtaszewski J. F.P. Birk J.B. Frosig C. Holten M. Pilegaard H. Dela F. J.

However, the role of the AMPK γ3 subunit, as well as whether mutations in this isoform regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and function in resting skeletal muscle, is unresolved. Here we determined the role of the AMPK γ3 subunit in the regulation of mitochondrial function and biogenesis in glycolytic skeletal muscle. Three mouse models were used to genetically dissect the functional role of the AMPKγ3 isoform: transgenic mice overexpressing either the wild-type or the R225Q mutant subunit (Tg-AMPKγ3wt or Tg-AMPKγ3225Q) and knock-out mice (AMPKγ3-/-). We provide evidence that the mutant form of the AMPK γ3 subunit influences gene expression, promoting adaptive metabolic responses on mitochondrial function and biogenesis in skeletal muscle.

Three different mouse models were used to investigate the role of the skeletal muscle specific AMPK γ3 subunit in the regulation of mitochondrial function and mitochondrial biogenesis: AMPK γ3 knock-out (AMPKγ3-/-), AMPK γ3 wild-type transgenic (Tg-AMPKγ3wt), and AMPK γ3R225Q transgenic (Tg-AMPKγ3225Q).

Mouse-specific primer/probe sets used to detect specific gene expression were selected by using PRIMER EXPRESS (Applied Biosystems) and are available upon request. The following primers for detection of the different myosin heavy chain isoforms were used: MyHC I forward (TTGTGCTACCCAGCTCTAAGGG) and reverse (CTGCTTCCACCTAAAGGGCTG); MyHC IIa forward (AAGCGAAGAGTAAGGCTGTC) and reverse (CTTGCAAAGGAACTTGGGCTC); MyHC IIb forward (GAAGAGCCGAGAGGTTCACAC) and reverse (CAGGACAGTGACAAAGAACGTC); and MyHC IIx forward (GAAGAGTGATTGATCCAAGTG) and reverse (TATCTCCCAAAGTTATGAGTACA). Relative quantities of target transcripts were calculated after normalization against a housekeeping gene (acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein PO) using the relative standard curve method. Muscle Lysate Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—White gastrocnemius muscles were homogenized in ice-cold buffer (10! (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1! Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 3 mm benzamidine (pH 7.4)). Whole muscle homogenates were rotated end-over-end for 1 h at 4 °C and then subjected to three freeze and thaw cycles to disrupt the mitochondria. The homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA protein assay kit, and sample dilutions were adjusted to yield equal protein concentration. Aliquots for Western blot analysis were mixed with Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5! nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1! (v/v) Tween. The blots were probed with primary antibody, followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody. Antibody-bound protein was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by densitometry. Quantification of Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number—To determine mitochondrial DNA levels, total genomic DNA was isolated from white gastrocnemius, and the amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was compared with nuclear DNA. Primers for mtDNA (cytochrome b; forward, AAAGCCACCTTGACCCGATT; reverse, GATTCGTAGGGCCGCGATA; Custom TaqMan® TAMRA™ probe, CGCTTTCCACTTCATCTTACCATT), nuclear DNA (mouse β-actin), and 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix were supplied by Applied Biosystems. Real time PCR quantitative analysis was performed using ΔCT on the sequence detector system ABI-Prism 7000. Copy number of mtDNA and nuclear DNA was calculated using the threshold cycle number (CT) intrapolated from the standard curve. Histological Methods—Gastrocnemius, plantaris, soleus, and EDL muscles were harvested and frozen together in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T.™ compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek Europe, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands). Serial skeletal muscle cross-sections (10 μm for fiber type measurement, immunostaining, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining) were generated in a Microstat HM 500M cryostat, mounted on SuperFrost slides (Menzel GmbH & Co., Braunschweig, Germany) and stored at -20 °C until use. Skeletal muscle fiber type (I, IIa, and IIb) was quantified using myosin ATPase staining (21Schiaffino S. Bormioli S.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1973; 21: 142-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections were subjected to acidic preincubation (0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m KCl, pH 4.43), incubated with ATP (90 mm glycine, 65 mm CaCl2, 90 mm NaCl, 3 mm ATP, pH 9.4), and subsequently treated with 1! (w/v) CaCl2, 2! (w/v) CoCl2, and 1! (v/v) (NH4)2S. Immunostaining was performed with MyHC type IIa (SC-71) and MyHC type I (D-5) antibodies, as directed by the M.O.M.™ kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). SDH staining was performed by treatment with incubation solution (6.5 mm NaH2PO4, 43.5 mm Na2HPO4, 0.6 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, and 50 mm sodium succinate, pH 7.6), followed by treatment with physiological saline and 15! ethanol. Following histological procedures, coverslips were secured over the slides with aqueous mounting medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Image Capture and Analysis—Images for fiber type analysis were captured using an Olympus DP70 camera (Olympus Corp., Japan) and Cast software (Visiopharm, Horsholm, Denmark). Quantification of the fiber type composition was performed using Image J version 1.37 (National Institutes of Health). Fiber type identification was made using threshold values of particle density: type I fibers ≤40, type IIa ≤210, and type IIb ≥210. An average of 100 fibers/muscle was counted, and the percentage of each fiber type per muscle was calculated. Electrophoretic Separation of MyHC Isoforms—White gastrocnemius muscle was dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1! (v/v) Triton X-100, 10! (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm pyrophosphate, and 1 μm microcystin), and 50 μl was removed prior to centrifugation. Total protein content was assessed using a BCA assay. Electrophoretic separation of MyHC isoforms was performed as described (22Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole muscle homogenate was separated on a glycerol SDS-polyacrylamide gel (stacking gel: 4! (v/v) acrylamide (40:1), 0.8! (v/v) bis (2:1), and 37! (v/v) glycerol; resolving gel: 8! (v/v) acrylamide (40:1), 0.2! (v/v) bis (2:1), and 37! (v/v) glycerol). Gels were run using a Minigel system (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C, 160 V for 28 h (5–10 mA) with upper and lower running buffer (100 mm Tris base, 150 mm glycine, 0.1! (w/v) SDS, pH 8.6; and 50 mm Tris base, 75 mm glycine, 0.05! SDS, respectively) at equal surface level. Gels were fixed overnight in 10! acetic acid and 40! ethanol and stained using the SilverQuest™ silver staining kit (Invitrogen). Images for quantification were acquired by scanning the gels with a GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad), and the relative proportion of each MyHC isoform was determined using Quantity 1 software (Bio-Rad). Bands were identified according to their migration characteristics, as described (22Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—For ultrastructural examination, white gastrocnemius muscle samples were processed for electron microscopic analysis. Skeletal muscle from Tg-AMPKγ3225Q mice and nontransgenic littermates was perfused-fixed with 2.5! glutaraldehyde with 300 mm sucrose in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2–7.4, dissected, cut into 1 × 1 × 2-mm pieces, and fixed overnight. Samples were postfixed for 1 h in 1! (v/v) osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through a graded series of alcohol/acetone, and embedded in Fluka Durcupan resin. Ultrathin 70-nm sections were placed on copper mesh grids (EMS), counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Morgagni 268 transmission electron microscope (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR). For quantification of percentage area of mitochondria 10 random images/muscle were captured using an AMT camera system (Advance Microscopy Techniques Corp., Danvers, MA) at ×20,400. Total mitochondrial volume density, and number was determined. Mitochondrial Respiration—Mitochondrial function was assessed using respirometry (Oroboros Oxygraph-2k; Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, Austria), as previously described (23Kuznetsov A.V. Schneeberger S. Seiler R. Brandacher G. Mark W. Steurer W. Saks V. Usson Y. Margreiter R. Gnaiger E. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: H1633-H1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Boushel R. Gnaiger E. Schjerling P. Skovbro M. Kraunsøe R. Dela F. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). White gastrocnemius muscle was placed in a relaxing solution (2.8 mm Ca2K2EGTA, 7.2 mm K2EGTA, 5.8 mm ATP, 6.6 mm MgCl2, 20 mm taurine, 15 mm sodium phosphocreatine, 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm MES, pH 7.1), and fibers were gently separated under a microscope using fine forceps. Following permeabilization of the sarcolemma in 0.005! (w/v) saponin, the tissue was equilibrated in ice-cold respirometry medium (0.5 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 60 mm potassium lactobionate, 20 mm taurine, 10 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES, 110 mm sucrose, and 0.1! (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.1) and blotted, and ∼1.5–2 mg of tissue/chamber was weighed and used for the experiment. All measurements were made in duplicate. Basal O2 flux from complex I (CI in Fig. 6) of the respiratory chain was measured by adding the substrates malate (final concentration 1.6 mm), glutamate (20 mm), and pyruvate (9.8 mm). Oxidative phosphorylation was quantified by the addition of ADP (4.8 mm), followed by the complex II substrate succinate (9.6 mm), for convergent electron flow through Complexes I + II. Then the protonophore carbonylcyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (0.2 μm) was titrated to achieve maximum flux trough the electron transfer system. Finally, electron transport through complexes I and III was inhibited by the sequential addition of rotenone (0.1 μm) and antimycin A (2.4 μm), respectively. The oxygen flux obtained in each step of the protocol was normalized by mitochondrial content/nuclei as determined in the same muscle using mitochondrial/nuclear DNA ratio (protocol detailed above). Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistically significant differences were determined using unpaired Student's t tests. Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Content Is Unaltered in Tg-AMPKγ3wt Mice—To ascertain whether overexpression of the AMPK γ3 subunit is sufficient to induce skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, we studied sedentary mice overexpressing the wild-type form of the AMPK γ3 subunit in glycolytic muscle (Tg-AMPKγ3wt). The mRNA expression profile of different transcription factors and mitochondrial markers was unaltered between Tg-AMPKγ3wt mice and nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 1a). However, mRNA expression of the co-activator PGC-1β was reduced in skeletal muscle from Tg-AMPKγ3wt mice. Protein content of several transcription factors, markers of the different complexes of the respiratory chain, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4), a key enzyme in the regulation of substrate utilization and the switch between glucose and fatty acid oxidation, was unaltered between Tg-AMPKγ3wt mice and nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 1, b and c). However, protein content of SDH ubiquinol oxidoreductase (complex II of the respiratory chain) was reduced in skeletal muscle from Tg-AMPKγ3wt mice (Fig. 1, b and c). Muscle mitochondrial content and transverse sections showing succinate dehydrogenase activity (SDH) were similar between Tg-AMPKγ3wt mice and nontransgenic littermates (Fig. 1, d and e). Thus, our results provide evidence to suggest that increasing the amount of the AMPK γ3 subunit is insufficient to induce mitochondrial adaptations in sedentary mice. Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Content Is Unaltered in AMPKγ3-/- Mice—To determine whether the AMPK γ3 subunit was required for resting skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, we measured mRNA expression and protein content of mitochondrial markers as well as mitochondrial number in AMPKγ3-/- mice. mRNA content of different co-activators, transcription factors, mitochondrial markers, and lipoprotein lipase, a marker of fatty acid metabolism, were unaltered between AMPKγ3-/- mice and wild-type littermates. Protein contents of PGC-1α and several mitochondrial markers were unaltered between AMPKγ3-/- and wild-type littermates. Moreover, mitochondrial content and SDH staining were similar between AMPKγ3-/- and wild-type littermates (Fig. 2, d and e). Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial Biogenesis Is Increased in Tg-AMPK"
https://openalex.org/W1989617578,"The stringent regulation of cell cycle progression helps to maintain genetic stability in cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of gene expression in diverse cellular pathways, including developmental patterning, hematopoietic differentiation and antiviral defense. Here, we show that two c-Myc-regulated miRNAs, miR-17 and miR-20a, govern the transition through G1 in normal diploid human cells. Inhibition of these miRNAs leads to a G1 checkpoint due to an accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting from premature temporal accumulation of the E2F1 transcription factor. Surprisingly, gross changes in E2F1 levels were not required to initiate the DNA damage response and checkpoint, as these responses could occur with a less than twofold change in E2F1 protein levels. Instead, our findings indicate that the precise timing of E2F1 expression dictates S-phase entry and that accurate timing of E2F1 accumulation requires converging signals from the Rb/E2F pathway and the c-Myc-regulated miR-17 and miR-20a miRNAs to circumvent a G1 checkpoint arising from the untimely accumulation of E2F1. These data provide a mechanistic view of miRNA-based regulation of E2F1 in the context of the emerging model that miRNAs coordinate the timing of cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2129037723,"Background Despite the uncertainty in the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), attempts have been made to record the association of certain antibodies in serum with neuropsychiatric (NP) manifestations. We aimed to assess the behaviour and the association of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) autoantibodies with NP manifestations in SLE patients (NPSLE). Methodology/Principal Findings Forty-seven SLE patients, hospitalized because of NP manifestations were included. They were evaluated at hospitalization and six months later, and serum and CSF samples were obtained at each evaluation. As controls, serum samples were taken from 49 non-NPSLE patients at hospitalization and six months later; serum and CSF samples were also obtained from 6 SLE patients with septic meningitis, 16 surgical SLE patients and 25 patients without autoimmune diseases. Antinuclear, anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P, Anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-cardiolipin, and anti-β2 glycoprotein-I antibodies were measured. In serum, anti-ribosomal P, anti-NMDAR, and other antibodies did not differentiate among SLE groups, and the levels of all antibodies were similar among the SLE groups. Six-months later, this scenario remained unchanged and the decrease in the levels of some autoantibodies reflected a decline in disease activity, rather than a change in NPSLE. In CSF, only the presence and the levels of anti-NMDAR antibodies showed a characteristic distribution in central NPSLE and septic meningitis patients. Six months later the prevalence of most antibodies in CSF did not change, however the levels of anti-dsDNA, anti-ribosomal P, and anti-NMDAR decreased. Conclusion In NPSLE, autoantibodies in serum do not reflect their behaviour in CSF. All autoantibodies were elevated in septic meningitis reflecting the global penetration of serum antibodies into the CSF in this condition. Anti-NMDAR antibodies in CSF identified patients with central NPSLE; their continued presence in CSF 6 months after neurologic symptoms raise questions regarding the conditions under which they are pathogenic."
https://openalex.org/W2120992354,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and insulin signaling in the adipose tissue are critical determinants of aging and age-associated diseases. It is not clear, however, if they represent independent factors or they are mechanistically linked. We investigated the effects of ROS on insulin signaling using as model system the p66Shc-null mice. p66Shc is a redox enzyme that generates mitochondrial ROS and promotes aging in mammals. We report that insulin activates the redox enzyme activity of p66Shc specifically in adipocytes and that p66Shc-generated ROS regulate insulin signaling through multiple mechanisms, including AKT phosphorylation, Foxo localization, and regulation of selected insulin target genes. Deletion of p66Shc resulted in increased mitochondrial uncoupling and reduced triglyceride accumulation in adipocytes and in vivo increased metabolic rate and decreased fat mass and resistance to diet-induced obesity. In addition, p66Shc-/- mice showed impaired thermo-insulation. These findings demonstrate that p66Shc-generated ROS regulate the effect of insulin on the energetic metabolism in mice and suggest that intracellular oxidative stress might accelerate aging by favoring fat deposition and fat-related disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2103180477,"Banaszynski et al. combine genetic manipulation with small-molecule regulation to produce rapid, reversible and tunable regulation of protein expression in vivo. The approach builds on earlier work showing that fusion of a destabilizing domain to a gene of interest confers instability to the expressed protein. Degradation of the protein is then prevented by subsequent addition of the cell-permeable stabilizing ligand, Shield-1, which binds specifically to the destabilizing domains. Three in vivo applications of the technology in mice are described. Conditional control of protein function in vivo offers great potential for deconvoluting the roles of individual proteins in complicated systems. We recently developed a method in which a small protein domain, termed a destabilizing domain, confers instability to fusion protein partners in cultured cells. Instability is reversed when a cell-permeable small molecule binds this domain. Here we describe the use of this system to regulate protein function in living mammals. We show regulation of secreted proteins and their biological activity with conditional secretion of an immunomodulatory cytokine, resulting in tumor burden reduction in mouse models. Additionally, we use this approach to control the function of a specific protein after systemic delivery of the gene that encodes it to a tumor, suggesting uses for enhancing the specificity and efficacy of targeted gene-based therapies. This method represents a new strategy to regulate protein function in living organisms with a high level of control."
https://openalex.org/W2113527476,"Studies of gene function are often hampered by gene-redundancy, especially in organisms with large genomes such as rice (Oryza sativa). We present an approach for using transcriptomics data to focus functional studies and address redundancy. To this end, we have constructed and validated an inexpensive and publicly available rice oligonucleotide near-whole genome array, called the rice NSF45K array. We generated expression profiles for light- vs. dark-grown rice leaf tissue and validated the biological significance of the data by analyzing sources of variation and confirming expression trends with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. We examined trends in the data by evaluating enrichment of gene ontology terms at multiple false discovery rate thresholds. To compare data generated with the NSF45K array with published results, we developed publicly available, web-based tools (www.ricearray.org). The Oligo and EST Anatomy Viewer enables visualization of EST-based expression profiling data for all genes on the array. The Rice Multi-platform Microarray Search Tool facilitates comparison of gene expression profiles across multiple rice microarray platforms. Finally, we incorporated gene expression and biochemical pathway data to reduce the number of candidate gene products putatively participating in the eight steps of the photorespiration pathway from 52 to 10, based on expression levels of putatively functionally redundant genes. We confirmed the efficacy of this method to cope with redundancy by correctly predicting participation in photorespiration of a gene with five paralogs. Applying these methods will accelerate rice functional genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2017933780,"Illicit drug overdose remains a leading cause of premature mortality in urban settings worldwide. We sought to estimate the number of deaths potentially averted by the implementation of a medically supervised safer injection facility (SIF) in Vancouver, Canada.The number of potentially averted deaths was calculated using an estimate of the local ratio of non-fatal to fatal overdoses. Inputs were derived from counts of overdose deaths by the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency and non-fatal overdose rates from published estimates. Potentially-fatal overdoses were defined as events within the SIF that required the provision of naloxone, a 911 call or an ambulance. Point estimates and 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. Between March 1, 2004 and July 1, 2008 there were 1004 overdose events in the SIF of which 453 events matched our definition of potentially fatal. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 there were 32, 37 and 38 drug-induced deaths in the SIF's neighbourhood. Owing to the wide range of non-fatal overdose rates reported in the literature (between 5% and 30% per year) we performed sensitivity analyses using non-fatal overdose rates of 50, 200 and 300 per 1,000 person years. Using these model inputs, the number of averted deaths were, respectively: 50.9 (95% CI: 23.6-78.1); 12.6 (95% CI: 9.6-15.7); 8.4 (95% CI: 6.5-10.4) during the study period, equal to 1.9 to 11.7 averted deaths per annum.Based on a conservative estimate of the local ratio of non-fatal to fatal overdoses, the potentially fatal overdoses in the SIF during the study period could have resulted in between 8 and 51 deaths had they occurred outside the facility, or from 6% to 37% of the total overdose mortality burden in the neighborhood during the study period. These data should inform the ongoing debates over the future of the pilot project."
https://openalex.org/W2141485959,"Trichromatic primates have a 'red-green' chromatic channel in addition to luminance and 'blue-yellow' channels. It has been argued that the red-green channel evolved in primates as an adaptation for detecting reddish or yellowish objects, such as ripe fruits, against a background of foliage. However, foraging advantages to trichromatic primates remain unverified by behavioral observation of primates in their natural habitats. New World monkeys (platyrrhines) are an excellent model for this evaluation because of the highly polymorphic nature of their color vision due to allelic variation of the L-M opsin gene on the X chromosome. In this study we carried out field observations of a group of wild, frugivorous black-handed spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi frontatus, Gray 1842, Platyrrhini), consisting of both dichromats (n = 12) and trichromats (n = 9) in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica. We determined the color vision types of individuals in this group by genotyping their L-M opsin and measured foraging efficiency of each individual for fruits located at a grasping distance. Contrary to the predicted advantage for trichromats, there was no significant difference between dichromats and trichromats in foraging efficiency and we found that the luminance contrast was the main determinant of the variation of foraging efficiency among red-green, blue-yellow and luminance contrasts. Our results suggest that luminance contrast can serve as an important cue in short-range foraging attempts despite other sensory cues that could be available. Additionally, the advantage of red-green color vision in primates may not be as salient as previously thought and needs to be evaluated in further field observations."
https://openalex.org/W2035343312,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) is an important enzyme in both plant development and pathogen defense. In all plants it is encoded by a multi-gene family, ranging in copy number from four in Arabidopsis to a dozen or more copies in some higher plants. Many studies indicate that alternate genes are differentially regulated in response to environmental stimuli. In this study, Southern blot and dot blot analyses in tomato indicate a surprisingly large family of related sequences with ∼26 copies in the diploid genome, some easily distinguished by restriction enzyme digestion. Analyses of a BAC genome library suggest that the genes are generally not clustered. A more detailed comparison of the gene sequences using PCR to isolate the individual copies and reverse transcription-PCR to study the transcripts that they encode indicates a significant diversity in the gene sequences themselves, but surprisingly only one mRNA transcript can be detected even when additional expression is induced by pathogen growth or wounding. Consistent with previous reports in other plants, a parallel study with a closely related plant, the potato, indicates a much broader utilization of the PAL genes, highlighting the unusual nature of this family in tomato and of the mechanism(s) that silences so many members.

Plant transformation analyses further demonstrate the presence of very active silencing, suggesting aggressive competition between PAL gene duplication and copy inactivation during PAL gene evolution. The duplication of individual genes, chromosome segments, and even entire genomes has long been considered an important source of evolutionary change leading to new gene functions (1Ku H.-M.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1441-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For example, in the Arabidopsis or rice genomes, up to 90% or 62% of loci are duplicated, respectively (3Moore R.C. Purugganan Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Despite this, it is much less clear how duplicated genes evolve to serve new functions. Presumably at least one copy is stable and maintains the existing function(s), whereas an expendable copy undergoes changes that are preserved by natural selection (neofunctionalization). Partial compromization of function (subfunctionalization) through mutation accumulation as well as stochastic silencing of such genes also are thought to play significant roles in the passive origin of new species (2Lynch M. Conery J.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (3390) Google Scholar). How such events might occur, however, remains an area of considerable debate (2Lynch M. Conery J.S.

Biochem. 1992; 204: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In tomato, hybridization analyses based on fragment length polymorphism initially indicated at least five different classes of PAL genes (8Lee S.-W. Robb E.J. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these classes (PAL 5) was distinctly (5-6-fold) more common. This type of PAL gene sequence also was found to be strongly expressed (9Lee S.-W. Heinz R. Robb J. Nazar R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have shown that in at least one member of this group, transcription is initiated from two sites that appear to be differentially regulated (9Lee S.-W. Heinz R. Robb J. Nazar R.N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 109-114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in response to changes in light or wounding or to infection by a plant pathogen. The high copy number associated with the PAL gene family in tomato together with a readily demonstrated and wide sequence polymorphism appears to make this gene family an attractive model for studies of gene duplication, evolution, and silencing. The pattern of sequence polymorphism suggests a highly duplicated family with both functional and more divergent members that might be responsive to various developmental events and environmental stresses. Indeed, initial studies on several of the divergent members indicate that dramatic changes are imposed by premature termination codons and frameshift mutations (8Lee S.-W. Robb E.J. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At least one of these (PAL 1) appeared to be slightly expressed, which raises intriguing questions about altered function (8Lee S.-W. Robb E.J. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To more precisely define the number and nature of the tomato PAL gene family members and to further assess the degree of their expression, studies have been undertaken to determine more accurately the actual copy number in tomato and the significance of sequence heterogeneity with respect to gene expression. Gene cloning has been used to determine the genomic sequences and detect their actual rRNA transcripts. The comparisons indicate a very redundant gene family comprising at least 18 different sequences, but almost all appear silenced. Only a single sequence represents all or an overwhelming majority of the transcripts. Plant Material—Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) cv. Craigella near-isolines, susceptible (CSG CR 26) and resistant (CRG CR 218) to Verticillium dahliae race 1, were grown in growth chambers (Conviron) at 26 °C for 14 h in the light and at 22 °C for 10 h in the dark. Before planting in a mixture of Promix, vermiculite, and turface media (3:2:1), the seeds were surface-sterilized in 1% hypochlorite solution for 10 min and then rinsed in distilled water three times for 1 h. The plants were transferred after seedling germination to 17 × 13 × 6-cm Kord cell flats (6 plants/flat). The soil was kept moist at all times. Hoagland's solution was used as fertilizer once a week (10Hoaglund, D. R., and Arnon, D. (1950) in Circular of the California Agricultual Experiment Station, Number 347Google Scholar). Preparation of Tomato Nuclear DNA—The nuclei were isolated from young leaves of 4-week-old tomato plants using a method similar to that described by Cushman (11Cushman J.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 8 g of fresh leaves or other plant tissue were divided into four batches. Each batch was finely chopped and homogenized in 10 ml of nuclei isolation buffer I containing 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, and 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2) using an Omni mixer (Omni International, Inc. Marietta, GA) with five bursts of 30 s at speed 3. The homogenate was then filtered through three layers of cheese-cloth, and 10% Triton X-100 solution was added dropwise to the filtrate to give a final concentration of 0.3% to lyse the chloroplasts. After 5 min of incubation on ice, nuclei isolation buffer II containing 1.25 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, and 6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.75 m with respect to sucrose and mixed by gentle swirling. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 700 rpm (57 × g) for 2 min at 4 °C in a Beckman JS7.5 swinging bucket rotor. The decanted supernatant was respun at 1800 rpm (380 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C in the same swinging bucket rotor. Each pellet was gently suspended in 250 μl of nuclei isolation buffer I and collected in a tube. An equal volume of nuclear lysis buffer (2 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.6% SDS, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) preheated to 60 °C was added, and the suspension was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C with occasional shaking. The nuclear lysate was then subjected to chloroform extraction, and the aqueous phase was mixed by gentle swirling with an equal volume of 95% ethanol containing 2% potassium acetate. The DNA was spooled out with a clean glass rod and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Finally, the nuclear genomic DNA was purified further using CsCl density gradient centrifugation (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Preparation of Cellular RNA—Total cellular RNA was prepared from tomato tissues using a method similar to that described by Heinz et al. (13Heinz R. Lee S.W. Saparno A. Nazar R.N. Robb J. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1998; 52: 385-396Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Tomato leaves or other tissues (0.5 g) were collected by cutting with scissors, immediately frozen, and ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. The powder was transferred to a homogenization tube containing 5 ml of extraction buffer (0.14 m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium citrate, 0.3% SDS, pH 6.8) and 5 ml of phenol and was homogenized for 10 strokes. The homogenate was transferred to a 10-ml plastic tube and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min with occasional shaking. After being cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 15 °C in a Beckman JA20 rotor, the aqueous phase was collected and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol containing 2% potassium acetate for 3 h or longer at -20 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C in the same rotor, the pellet was washed with ethanol, dried, resuspended in 300 μl of sterilized distilled water, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and reprecipitated with a one-half volume of 7.5 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of 95% ethanol. The RNA was further collected by centrifugation for 3 min in a microcentrifuge and washed with ethanol. Finally, the pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of sterilized distilled water. The amount and quality of RNA was determined by the absorbance at 260/280 nm and confirmed by gel analysis of the ribosomal RNA components after being stained with methylene blue (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). PCR Amplification and Determination of PAL Gene Sequences—Targeted genome sequences were amplified using either Taq or Pfu DNA polymerase. For Taq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas, Hanover, PA), 1 unit of enzyme was added to 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 25 °C), 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 15-20 pmol of each gene-specific primer, and 200-300 ng of nuclear genomic DNA. For the high fidelity polymerase, 1.25 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) was added to 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, 0.1-0.2 μm of each gene-specific primer, and 200-300 ng of nuclear genomic DNA. Two coding regions of the PAL genes, major portions of exon I and exon II, respectively, were targeted using alternate primer sets, a forward primer, 5′-ACAAATGGACATRTTAAT-3′ (where R is A or G; P1) and 5′-CTTCTATGAGATGTTGC-3′ (reverse primer; P2) for the first exon, and 5′-GAATTCACTGACTATTT-3′ (forward primer; P3) and 5′-GATAGGTTGATGACATT-3′ (reverse primer; P4) for the second exon, respectively. Targeted fragments were amplified in a programmable heating block (Gene ATAQ Controller; Pharmacia LKB) using 30 reaction cycles consisting of a 30-s denaturation step at 95 °C, a 1-min annealing step at 43 °C, and a 1-min elongation step at 72 °C. After amplification, PCR products were purified by chloroform extraction and initially assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each amplified fragment was subcloned into the pTZ19R cloning vector, first digested with restriction endonuclease SmaI and then “tailed” with thymidylic acid residues at the 3′ ends of the SmaI site as previously described (14Marchuk D. Drumm M. Saulino A. Collins S.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). When Pfu DNA polymerase was used, the amplified products were first “tailed” with adenylic acid residues. After incubation with T4 DNA ligase overnight at 14 °C, the recombined DNA was used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α and ampicillin-resistant colonies were then screened by colony hybridization (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Each colony grown on an LB agar plate containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin was transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Whatman, Brentford, UK) using a sterilize toothpick and then grown on a fresh LB plate containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin for 6 h at 37 °C. Each filter containing the bacterial colonies was soaked in 0.5 m NaOH for 8 min twice and neutralized with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1.5 m NaCl for 8 min. The air-dried filter was washed twice with 95% ethanol, dried at 80 °C for 2 h to fix the bacterial DNA to the filter, and then hybridized with probe solution (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS) containing labeled PAL gene-specific probes at 50 °C for 16-20 h. After hybridization, the filter was washed three times, 15 min each, with washing solution (probe solution without probes) at 50 °C and twice, 5 min each with 2× SSC at room temperature. Finally, the air-dried filter was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak XAR-5) at -70 °C for 12-16 h using an intensifying screen. To prepare probes, PCR-amplified DNA fragments for the two PAL protein-encoding regions were purified from agarose gels using a gel extraction system (Qiaquick gel extraction kit; Qiagen), denatured, and labeled with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Klenow; MBI Fermentas), using random hexamers as primers and [α-32P]dATP as previously described (15Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16651) Google Scholar). For DNA sequence analyses, plasmid DNAs were prepared using a miniprep DNA purification system (Wizard Plus SV Minipreps, Promega). Both strands of the insert in each clone were sequenced with either a forward primer, 5′-GACGTTGTAAAACGACG-3′ (U2) or a reverse primer, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′ (ARP), in an automated sequencing system (CEQ8000 8-capillary Genetic Analysis System; Beckman). All of the sequence alignment was carried out using the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor, version 4.3.2 (North Carolina State University). RT-PCR Amplification and Determination of PAL mRNA Sequences—DNA for mRNA sequence analyses was prepared from cellular RNA extracts by RT-PCR amplification as described by Gerad (16Gerad G.F. Focus. 1987; 9: 5-6Google Scholar). The cDNA was prepared using 20-μl reaction volumes containing 300-500 μg of total RNA, 2-5 pmol of a PAL gene-specific primer, 0.2 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, reaction buffer (5× buffer containing 375 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript II; Invitrogen). A 13-μl aliquot containing a gene-specific primer; 5′-CTTCTATGAGATGTTGC-3′ for the exon 1 region or 5′-GATAGGTTGATGACATT-3′ for exon 2, RNA extract, and dNTPs was heated at 65 °C for 5 min and quickly chilled on ice. After brief centrifugation, reaction buffer and dithiothreitol were added, and the mixture was further incubated at 42 °C for 2 min. Finally, reverse transcriptase was added, and the solution was mixed by pipette before incubation at 42 °C for 50 min. The reaction was heat-inactivated at 75 °C for 5 min, and 2 μl of the product were used as a template for subsequent PCR amplifications. The cDNAs were PCR-amplified using the exon 1- and 2-specific primer pairs; the products were cloned subsequently, and their sequences were determined as described for the PAL genes. Agrobacterium-mediated Tomato Transformation—Tomato cells were transformed with Agrobacterium containing pCAMP5GUS recombinants as described by Fillatti et al. (17Fillatti J.J. Kiser J. Rose R. Comai L. BioTechnology. 1987; 5: 726-730Crossref Scopus (402) Google Scholar), based on an online protocol with minor modifications. Briefly, tomato (cv. Craigella, susceptible) seeds were sterilized with 70% ethanol for 1 min followed with 5.25% NaOCl for 20 min with swirling and then rinsed six times with sterile distilled water. The sterilized seeds were transferred to culture vessels containing 50 ml of medium A for cultivation under light (25 °C, 16 h photoperiod). Eight- or 9-day-old seedlings were placed in sterile distilled water, and the cotyledons were cut with sterile scissors and transferred to agar plates containing 20 ml of medium B with 100 μm of acetosyringone (18Stachel S.E. Messens E. Montagu M.V. Zambryski P. Nature. 1985; 318: 624-629Crossref Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The plates were sealed with parafilm and precultured for 24 h at 25 °C in the dark. Cultures of Agrobacterium containing a transforming plasmid construct (pCAMP5GUS) were grown overnight in 6 ml of YEP medium with 25 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin with shaking at 28 °C. The overnight culture was diluted with liquid Murashiga Skoog medium to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5, and 8 ml were poured onto the cotyledons placed in Petri dishes with liquid medium B containing 100 μm of acetosyringone. After incubation for 30 min with occasional swirling, the excess Agrobacterium suspension was removed by aspiration, and the cotyledons were transferred to preculture plates containing medium B with 100 μm of acetosyringone for co-cultivation at 25 °C for 48 h in the dark. The co-cultured cotyledon explants were transferred to Petri dishes with medium C containing 100 μg/ml kanamycin and 150 μg/ml timentin and subcultured on fresh medium C every 3-5 days to initiate calli. After 2-3 weeks, calli with shoot primordia were excised as small pieces and transferred to regeneration and selection medium D for weekly subculturing. When shoot stems had elongated to 2-4 cm, the shoots were excised from the calli and transferred to rooting medium E in magenta boxes. Plantlets of about 5-cm height subsequently were removed from the culture vessels and transplanted into regular pots with moistened soil, a mixture of Pro-mix, vermiculite, and turface (3:2:1). The pots were covered with transparent plastic wrap before being moved to a controlled growth room (25 °C, 16-h photoperiod). After 3 days, the holes were made in the plastic wrap cover that were enlarged further everyday to adapt the plants gradually and avoid desiccation. Transgenic plants were transplanted into larger pots after 2-3 weeks. Assay of Methylated DNA Sites—Methylated DNA sites were assayed using bisulfite conversion genomic sequencing as previously described (19Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1827-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar). Tomato nuclear genomic DNA digested with EcoRI restriction enzyme was diluted to 2 μg/50 μl with double distilled water and 5.5 μl of 3 m NaOH were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, 30 μl of freshly prepared 10 mm hydroquinone and 520 μl of freshly prepared 5 m sodium bisulfite were added and mixed. Mineral oil was layered over the solution before incubation at 50 °C in the dark for 9 h. After mixing with 600 μl of miniprep neutralization solution, Wizard plus SV miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI), the mixture was added to a miniprep column and cleaned by microcentrifuge for 1 min. DNA in a column was then washed with 80% isopropanol and eluted with 50 μl of double distilled water preheated to 65 °C. The eluted DNA was mixed with 5.5 μl of 3 m NaOH and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. A one-half volume of 7.5 m ammonium acetate and two volumes of 95% ethanol were added, and the DNA was precipitated at -20 °C, overnight. Finally, the pelleted DNA was washed with ethanol and resuspended in 20 μl of double distilled water. A 200-300-ng aliquot of bisulfite converted or unconverted control DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification of PAL gene upstream regions using primer sets designed for bisulfite converted or unconverted DNA, as appropriate. All PCR-amplified products were cloned using pTZ19R for subsequent DNA sequence analyses. Previous studies on the PAL gene sequences in tomato indicated a heterologous family of genes, but the degree of heterogeneity, both with respect to gene sequence and expression, remained unclear. Southern hybridization analyses after EcoRI digestion have demonstrated at least five different members but did not resolve whether differences in band intensities reflected further gene heterogeneity or simply resulted from transfer/hybridization artifacts (8Lee S.-W. Robb E.J. Nazar R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More exhaustive transfers in this study actually increased the number of different bands to as many as seven, but once more, the significance of the relative intensities remained unresolved. As shown in Fig. 1 (right panel), when membranes were hybridized with a 581-bp EcoRI fragment of a tomato PAL5 gene (20Lee S.-W. Nazar R.N. Powell D.A. Robb J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), of the seven distinct bands most appear approximately equal in intensity; however, the shortest remained about 5-fold darker and the additional fragments (X1 and X2) appeared somewhat underrepesented. To quantify the copy number more accurately, in the present study dot blots initially were used to determine the actual total number of PAL gene-related sequences (Fig. 2). Known amounts of a PCR-amplified PAL5 gene fragment (upper row), purified tomato genomic DNA (middle row), and cloned PALX1 plasmid DNA (lower row) were spotted, and the membranes again were hybridized with labeled PAL5 gene probe. As shown in Fig. 2, multiple applications with differing amounts of DNA were spotted to evaluate the linearity of this scale. Based on the hybridization signal intensities and assuming a 950-Mb genome size for tomato, the blots indicated that there were ∼13 copies of the PAL gene sequence/haploid genome or a total of 26 copies/diploid tomato cell. As indicated, both standards resulted in very similar values, 24.6 ± 1.7 and 25.6 ± 2.6, respectively. When combined with the results shown in Fig. 1 (right panel), the weakest bands would be consistent with one copy per haploid genome, the darker bands with two (PAL1 and PAL2) and five (PAL5) copies, respectively. In addition to hybridization analyses two other analytical approaches subsequently were applied to explore further the degree of heterogeneity in the tomato PAL gene family. In the first instance, a tomato genome library was examined for clusters of PAL genes. The deep coverage tomato BAC library (LE_HBa), prepared by Budiman et al. (21Budiman M.A. Mao L. Wood T.C. Wing R.A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 129-136PubMed Google Scholar), was obtained on nylon membranes from the Clemson University Genome Institute and screened with the most abundant 580-bp EcoRI PAL5 gene fragment also used in the dot blot experiments. The selected BAC clones of the large DNA fragments making up the library subsequently were obtained from the same source and subjected to both hybridization and DNA sequence analyses. As shown in Fig. 1, to evaluate the distribution of the PAL gene sequences in these large fragments, the eight BAC clones, which were selected as positive in this manner, initially were studied further by Southern blot hybridization. Purified plasmid DNA was digested with restriction enzymes (left panel) and probed by hybridization (middle panel) using the same PAL gene probe that was utilized in the prior studies and selection of the BAC clones themselves. Based on the observed restriction fragment length polymorphism (Fig. 1, center panel), in all but one instance only a single family member was identified in each BAC clone. In the single exception (62J4) only, two distinct sequences (PALX1 and PAL2) were present. Subsequent sequence analyses of these clones fully supported this conclusion. As also indicated in Fig. 1 (lower panel), a sequence comparison clearly shows all the sequences were consistent with unique PAL genes. Taken together these analyses show that despite the high copy number, the members of this family are not highly linked or clustered but dispersed widely in the tomato genome. In view of the family size and the varied roles that plant phenylalanine lyases can play in plant development and pathogen defense mechanisms, further studies were undertaken to link specific members of the family with individual functions in plant cells. Initially, a survey of the expressed genes was undertaken based on sequence analyses. Using primer sets complementary to two known highly conserved sequence regions, a major portion of exon 1 (360 bp) and a comparable region in exon 2 (652 bp), DNA was prepared by PCR amplification using purified genomic DNA or cDNA, itself prepared using reverse transcriptase and purified whole cell RNA (Fig. 3). In each case, the PCR-amplified DNA was cloned using the pTZ19R vector. In the first experiments, Taq polymerase was used to prepare the DNA, but ambiguous single base changes were commonly observed, and the experiments were repeated using the more faithful Pfu RNA polymerase (22Lundberg K.S. Shoemaker D.D. Adams M.W.W. Short J.M. Sorge J.A. Mathur E.J. Genetics. 1991; 180: 1-6Google Scholar). Only the second group of experiments are presented in this report, but the same general conclusion could be drawn with either polymerase. As indicated in Figs. 4 and 5 and strongly supportive of the early studies using dot or southern gel blot analyses, genomic sequence analyses after DNA cloning again indicated a surprisingly large, heterologous family of gene members. Of the 28 clone sequences that were determined, 13 or 18 unique sequence groups were identified for the exon 1 and 2 regions, respectively. Multiple changes in sequence distinguished each group (unshaded regions); multiple clones sharing a common sequence were observed for four groups in exon 1 and five groups in exon 2 as indicated by the closed boxes.FIGURE 4Comparison of tomato PAL gene exon 1 region sequences. Exon 1 DNA was amplified from genomic DNA as described in Fig. 3 and cloned in pTZ19R, and the sequences of randomly picked clones were determined by automated sequence analysis.

https://openalex.org/W1976590851,"A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neural structures and their function. Recording of neural activity with arrays of electrodes is a primary tool employed toward this goal. However, the relationships among the neural activity recorded by these arrays are often highly complex making it problematic to accurately quantify a network's structural information and then relate that structure to its function. Current statistical methods including cross correlation and coherence have achieved only modest success in characterizing the structural connectivity. Over the last decade an alternative technique known as Granger causality is emerging within neuroscience. This technique, borrowed from the field of economics, provides a strong mathematical foundation based on linear auto-regression to detect and quantify ""causal"" relationships among different time series. This paper presents a combination of three Granger based analytical methods that can quickly provide a relatively complete representation of the causal structure within a neural network. These are a simple pairwise Granger causality metric, a conditional metric, and a little known computationally inexpensive subtractive conditional method. Each causal metric is first described and evaluated in a series of biologically plausible neural simulations. We then demonstrate how Granger causality can detect and quantify changes in the strength of those relationships during plasticity using 60 channel spike train data from an in vitro cortical network measured on a microelectrode array. We show that these metrics can not only detect the presence of causal relationships, they also provide crucial information about the strength and direction of that relationship, particularly when that relationship maybe changing during plasticity. Although we focus on the analysis of multichannel spike train data the metrics we describe are applicable to any stationary time series in which causal relationships among multiple measures is desired. These techniques can be especially useful when the interactions among those measures are highly complex, difficult to untangle, and maybe changing over time."
https://openalex.org/W2076983066,"Background Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF)-1α is a transcription factor that functions as master regulator of mammalian oxygen homeostasis. In addition, recent studies identified a role for HIF-1α as transcriptional regulator during inflammation or infection. Based on studies showing that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is among the most potent biological stimuli to induce an inflammatory milieu, we hypothesized a role of HIF-1α as transcriptional regulator during infections with RSV. Methodology, Principal Findings We gained first insight from immunohistocemical studies of RSV-infected human pulmonary epithelia that were stained for HIF-1α. These studies revealed that RSV-positive cells also stained for HIF-1α, suggesting concomitant HIF-activation during RSV infection. Similarly, Western blot analysis confirmed an approximately 8-fold increase in HIF-1α protein 24 h after RSV infection. In contrast, HIF-1α activation was abolished utilizing UV-treated RSV. Moreover, HIF-α-regulated genes (VEGF, CD73, FN-1, COX-2) were induced with RSV infection of wild-type cells. In contrast, HIF-1α dependent gene induction was abolished in pulmonary epithelia following siRNA mediated repression of HIF-1α. Measurements of the partial pressure of oxygen in the supernatants of RSV infected epithelia or controls revealed no differences in oxygen content, suggesting that HIF-1α activation is not caused by RSV associated hypoxia. Finally, studies of RSV pneumonitis in mice confirmed HIF-α-activation in a murine in vivo model. Conclusions/Significance Taking together, these studies suggest hypoxia-independent activation of HIF-1α during infection with RSV in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1981557699,"O-Mannosyl-linked glycosylation is abundant within the central nervous system, yet very few glycoproteins with this glycan modification have been identified. Congenital diseases with significant neurological defects arise from inactivating mutations found within the glycosyltransferases that act early in the O-mannosyl glycosylation pathway. The N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase known as GnT-Vb or -IX is highly expressed in brain and branches O-mannosyl-linked glycans. Our results using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells indicate that GnT-Vb activity promotes the addition of the O-mannosyl-linked HNK-1 modification found on the developmentally regulated and neuron-specific receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ). These changes in glycosylation accompany decreased cell-cell adhesion and increased rates of migration on laminin. In addition, we show that expression of GnT-Vb promotes its dimerization and inhibits RPTPβ intrinsic phosphatase activity, resulting in higher levels of phosphorylated β-catenin, suggesting a mechanism by which GnT-Vb glycosylation couples to changes in cell adhesion. GnT-Vb-mediated glycosylation of RPTPβ promotes galectin-1 binding and RPTPβ levels of retention on the cell surface. N-Acetyllactosamine, but not sucrose, treatment of cells results in decreased RPTP retention, showing that galectin-1 binding contributes to the increased retention after GnT-Vb expression. These results place GnT-Vb as a regulator of RPTPβ signaling that influences cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in the developing nervous system.

Glycosylation is regulated spatially and temporally during the development of the nervous system (1Breen K.C. Coughlan C.M. Hayes F.D. Mol. Neurobiol. 1998; 16: 163-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In particular, sulfated glycoconjugates, such as the human natural killer-1 epitope, are important for proper migration and adhesion during neural development (2Schwarting G.A. Jungalwala F.B.

The human natural killer-1 (HNK-1)3 epitope was originally discovered using a monoclonal antibody raised against a specific T-lymphoblastoid cell type (4Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1024-1029PubMed Google Scholar). Since its discovery in lymphocytes, the HNK-1 (also known as CD57) antibody has been shown to react with many neural cell types, including glial, neuroectoderm, and neuroendocrine cells (5Lipinski M.

The HNK-1 epitope consists of a glucuronic acid, transferred by glucuronyltransferases (GlcATs), that is 3-sulfated by HNK-1 sulfotransferase (HNK1st), linked to a precursor N-acetyllactosamine structure (Fig. 1). Numerous glycoproteins bearing the HNK-1 epitope have been identified in the nervous system, such as neural cell adhesion molecule (9Rathjen F.G. Wolff J.M. Frank R. Bonhoeffer F. Rutishauser U. J.

Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In certain cell types, such as neural crest cells, the expression of the HNK-1 antigen is highly regulated during development (2Schwarting G.A. Jungalwala F.B. Chou D.K. Boyer A.M. Yamamoto M. Dev. Biol. 1987; 120: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and is often found on migratory cells (3Bronner-Fraser M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 115: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 antigen is linked to critical functions during the formation of the nervous system, such as cell-matrix interactions (16Hall H. Carbonetto S. Schachner M. J.

Harroch S. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which can be detected by the monoclonal antibody Cat-315. Interestingly, the Cat-315 antibody has been shown to react with different perisynaptic extracellular matrix components during synapse formation, suggesting a role for O-mannosyl-linked HNK-1 in synaptogenesis (15Dino M.R. Harroch S. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). O-Mannosyl-linked glycans were originally thought to be a fungus-specific glycosylation until Margolis and co-workers (24Finne J. Krusius T. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol.

In the biosynthesis of these O-mannosyl glycans, the glycosyltransferase that adds GlcNAc to mannose in the 2-position is PomGnT1 (28Zhang W. Betel D. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whereas the enzyme that adds GlcNAc to the 6-position of mannose is GnT-Vb (29Kaneko M. Alvarez-Manilla G. Kamar M. Lee I. Lee J.K. Troupe K. Zhang W. Osawa M. Pierce M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), also known as GnT-IX (30Inamori K. Endo T. Gu J. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Fujii S. Iwasaki H.

As shown in Fig. 1, PomGnT1 addition of GlcNAc in β1,2-Man linkage is required before GnT-Vb can subsequently add the GlcNAcβ1,6-Man linkage (30Inamori K. Endo T. Gu J. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Fujii S.

It has been proposed by Taniguchi and co-workers (30Inamori K. Endo T. Gu J. Matsuo I. Ito Y. Fujii S. Iwasaki H. Narimatsu H. Miyoshi E. Honke K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2337-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that the HNK-1 epitope may be added following the addition of β1,6-GlcNAc. The addition of β1,6-GlcNAc would be expected to increase the amount of N-acetyllactosamine backbone required for the subsequent activity of HNK-1-specific glucuronyltransferases like GlcATs and HNK1st. Galectins, in particular galectin-1, that bind to N-acetyllactosamine have been shown to play an important role in regulating cell adhesion and migration, and could likely bind the products of GnT-Vb (reviewed in Ref. 31Elola M.T. Wolfenstein-Todel C. Troncoso M.F. Vasta G.R. Rabinovich G.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 1679-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether GnT-Vb expression regulates the levels of HNK-1 epitope found on specific neural glycoproteins and exploring the phenotypic effects that result from expression of GnT-Vb. We first found that increased expression of GnT-Vb resulted in significantly reduced levels of cell-cell adhesion, increased migration, and increased binding of exogenous galectin-1 to cells. In addition, the most abundant substrate for GnT-Vb glycosylation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells was identified as a receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase known as RPTPβ. This receptor binds ligands, such as pleiotrophin, which inhibit its intrinsic phosphatase activity and attenuate its intracellular signaling, leading to changes in cell adhesion and migration. The effects on cell behavior we observed following GnT-Vb expression may therefore result from effects on RPTPβ activity and subsequent signaling events. Our results show that GnT-Vb expression inhibits RPTPβ intrinsic phosphatase activity and its signaling via phosphorylated β-catenin. Furthermore, GnT-Vb expression results in increased cell-surface retention of RPTPβ, which is likely the cause of its attenuated phosphatase activity and downstream signaling. Increased cell-surface retention of RPTPβ would favor receptor clustering, leading to increased dimerization and inhibition of phosphatase activity. The increased retention of RPTPβ at the cell surface is accompanied by an increased association with endogenous galectin-1, suggesting a working model for the effects of GnT-Vb glycosylation of RPTPβ and changes in neural cell adhesion and migration.

Baum (UCLA). Plasmids—The lentiviral GnT-Vb expression vector was produced by cloning the EcoRI/NotI fragment from 3.1-HA-Vb (35Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) into the EcoRI/NotI ends of pCDH1-MCS1-EF1-copGFP (Systems Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). The GnT-Vb siRNA lentiviral vector was produced by cloning the GnT-Vb-coding siRNA targeting sequences described previously (35Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) into the pSIH-H1-Puro vector (Systems Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) The pMD.G plasmid (encodes the envelope protein G of the vesicular stomatitis virus) and the PCMVdelta R9 packaging plasmids were gifts from the Trono laboratory (36Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (3937) Google Scholar). Production of Lentivirus and Cell Culture—The 293T and SH-SY5Y cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Lentivirus was produced by transfection of 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 with the following amounts of plasmids: 8 μg of envelope (pMD.G), 5 μg of lentiviral vector, and 8 μg of packaging plasmid. Approximately 5.5 ml of 293T cell suspension (1.2 × 106) in growth media were seeded onto Lipofectamine 2000 complexes (formed in Opti-MEM I media) in 10-cm tissue culture plates. The next day the cells were replenished with fresh media, and infectious lentivirus supernatant was collected at 48 and 72 h post-transfection. Polybrene was added to lentiviral supernatants at a final concentration of 8 μg/ml, and the virus was placed on cells overnight. Cells were refed with growth media, and the percentage of transduced cells was determined by fluorescent microscopy at 48 h post-infection. Scratch wound experiments were performed as described previously (35Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell-Cell Adhesion Assays—For cell-cell aggregation assays, subconfluent cells were washed with PBS and detached in the following buffer: 150 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm CaCl2. Single-cell suspensions at 2.0 × 105/ml were incubated in 24-well plates coated with 1% BSA for 30 min at 37 °C with agitation at 80 rpm. Cell aggregation was determined by counting the number of cell-aggregates with three or more cells in each field at the 10-min time point. A total of five random fields per well were chosen, and the results are expressed as a percentage of the mean relative to the mean total number of cells per field. WGA Precipitation, β-Catenin Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Total cell lysate (500 μg) was precipitated overnight at 4 °C using 50 μl of WGA-agarose. WGA precipitates were washed three times in ice-cold 1× PBS before proteins were boiled into SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) in 1× MES buffer or 3–8% Tris acetate gels in 1× Tris acetate buffer before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat milk (TBST BLOTTO). Cat-315 antibody was diluted 1:5 in TBST BLOTTO and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-IgM antibody was diluted 1:5,000 in TBST BLOTTO and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. The CD57 antibody was diluted 1:5,000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the anti-IgM secondary antibody was diluted 1:5,000 in TBS BLOTTO as described. Washed blots were detected using Western Lightning® Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposure to Kodak Biomax chemiluminescent film. For the analysis of β-catenin phosphorylation, cells were incubated in serum-free media for 24 h before addition of pleiotrophin at 50 ng/ml for 10 min. Cells were lysed in the following buffer: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 mm pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm ammonium molybdate, protease inhibitor tablets complete (Roche Diagnostics). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and 500 μg of protein was used for each β-catenin immunoprecipitation (AB19022, Chemicon). Two micrograms of β-catenin antibody was incubated with the lysate overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were captured using 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing the proteins were boiled from the agarose and separated on 4–12% BisTris gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with the phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 overnight at 4 °C. The blots were detected with anti-mouse conjugated horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescent detection. Blots were then detected with anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-102) to normalize for total β-catenin levels. Cell-surface Half-life and Protein Cross-linking—For cell-surface half-life analysis SH-SY5Y cells were washed twice in cold 1× PBS and biotinylated using 1 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were returned to culture for an additional 3 or 12 h before being lysed in 1× TBS, 1% Triton X-100/protease inhibitor mixture. Biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated with 50 μl of streptavidin magnetic beads (Promega). Proteins were separated on 4–12% BisTris gels in 1× MES buffer before transfer and Western blot detection using the indicated antibodies. For cross-linking experiments the cells were washed twice in ice-cold 1× PBS before being incubated with 3 mm BS3 (Pierce) in 1× PBS on ice for 1 h. Cross-linking reagent was quenched by the addition of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 mm for 10 min on ice. Cells were lysed as described above before being used in precipitation experiments using the monoclonal 5210 RPTP antibody and galectin-1. Flow Cytometry—Intact nonpermeabilized SH-SY5Y cells were washed with 1× PBS and released from the culture dishes with 2 mm EDTA in 1× PBS. Cells (5 × 105) per reaction were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml biotinylated galectin-1 in 1× PBS, 1% BSA for 30 min on ice in the presence of 10 mm sucrose or 10 mm N-acetyllactosamine (Sigma) in a 100-μl volume. Cells were washed in 1× PBS and incubated in phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a 1:100 dilution for 15 min on ice. After washing the cells, data were acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using software by CellQuest. For the analysis of RPTPβ surface levels, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated in 10 mm sucrose or N-acetyllactosamine for 2 h in 1× PBS, 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were detached using 2 mm EDTA before labeling the cells with antibody 5210 (1:1,000) in a 100-μl volume of 1× PBS, 1% BSA on ice for 15 min. The IgM antibody was detected using an anti-IgM Alexa Fluor 633 secondary (1:500) diluted in 1× PBS, 1% BSA on ice for 15 min. RPTPβ Immunoprecipitation—Mock, GnT-Vb+, or GnT-Vb siRNA SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in 1× TBS, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Endogenous phosphate was removed from cell lysates using Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Biosciences). Lysates were pre-cleared, and 500 μg was used for each precipitation. Two micrograms of anti-RPTPβ antibody was used for each precipitation at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein A/G Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 50 μl, was added to each precipitation at 4 °C for 2 h. Tyrosine Phosphatase Activity Assay—Precipitates were washed in lysis buffer 3 times and equilibrated to 1× phosphatase buffer (20 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Immunoprecipitated RPTPβ (10 μl) from a total of 50 μl was then subjected to an in vitro activity assay performed with the tyrosine phosphatase assay kit (Promega) using Tyr phosphopeptide (END(pY)INASL), where pY represents phosphotyrosine as substrate. A serially diluted standard of 1 mm KH2PO4 was used to generate a standard curve. Equivalent levels of precipitated RPTPβ were verified by Western blotting. Phosphatase activity is shown as the level of phosphate released (pmol/min/μl). Data shown are the mean of triplicate determinations from two separate experiments. Glycanase Digestions—O-Glycanase and neuraminidase digestions were performed before N-glycanase digestion. WGA-precipitated proteins on agarose were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 20 mm sodium acetate, and 25 mm NaCl. O-Glycosidase, 20 milliunits/ml (Roche Diagnostics), and/or neuraminidase, 100 milliunits/ml (Roche Diagnostics), were added, and reactions were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The resin was equilibrated in the following buffer: 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.05% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Proteins in solution were separated from the resin, and KCl was added to a final of 10 mm. Reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C to remove the potassium salts of SDS. Nonidet P-40 detergent was added to a final of 0.15%, and 2 μl of peptide:N-glycosidase F (5 milliunits/50 μl) was added, and the reaction tubes were placed at 37 °C for 16–18 h. Digested proteins were recovered by ethanol precipitation prior to gel electrophoresis. GnT-Vb Expression Increases the Levels of O-Mannosyl-linked HNK-1 Epitope, Contributing to Increased Cell Migration and Decreased Cell-Cell Aggregation—Our previous work demonstrated that suppression of either GnT-Vb or PomGnT1 expression decreased integrin-dependent SH-SY5Y cell migration on laminin (35Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The fact that GnT-Vb and PomGnT1 suppression resulted in a similar phenotype suggested that O-mannosyl glycans played a role in adhesion and migration of these cells on laminin. In this study, we aimed to define potential acceptor substrates for GnT-Vb that could be regulating cell adhesion and migration. The neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y has a neural crest lineage; the HNK-1 epitope is highly expressed in neural crest cells (37Pedraza L. Spagnol G. Latov N. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 40: 716-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 38Dharmesh S.M. Skelton T.P. Baenziger J.U. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 19: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and plays a role in modulating adhesion and migration to laminin (16Hall H. Carbonetto S. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Hall H. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Vaughan L. Schmitz B. Schachner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the possibility that GnT-Vb expression regulates O-mannosyl-linked HNK-1 glycans in SH-SY5Y cells. To determine whether increased GnT-Vb levels affected the expression of the HNK-1 epitope in SH-SY5Y cells, the cells were transduced with lentivirus from a GnT-Vb expression construct or lentivirus from empty vector, followed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies specific for HNK-1 epitopes, anti-CD57 and Cat-315. The lectin WGA was employed to precipitate glycoproteins with terminal GlcNAc, concentrating any glycoproteins that may have been glycosylated by GnT-Vb. A recent report characterized the specificity of Cat-315 antibody for O-mannosyl-linked HNK-1 (15Dino M.R. Harroch S. Hockfield S. Matthews R.T. Neuroscience. 2006; 142: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the Cat-315 antibody exhibited a very low but detectable level of reactivity in mock-transfected cells, and a large increase in binding in the GnT-Vb-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). The largest increase for both Cat-315 and CD57 antibody binding occurred in a diffuse band migrating above 250 kDa (Fig. 2A, asterisk). To determine whether the Cat-315 reactivity of this large glycoprotein was due primarily to N-linked or O-linked glycans, we performed serial digestions using sialidase and O-glycanase, followed by N-glycanase digestion. Using a 3–8% gradient Tris acetate gel to allow better separation of high molecular weight proteins, immunoblotting using the Cat-315 antibody revealed that the glycoprotein(s) present in this band (migrating at ∼350–400 kDa before digestion) retained Cat-315 reactivity after all digestions (Fig. 2B). Although a size shift of the band was apparent after each digestion, demonstrating that some glycans were removed by the enzymatic treatments, the reactivity with Cat-315 remained. Additional digestions with β-hexosaminidase and β-galactosidase were also performed, but the Cat-315 epitope was resistant to these enzymes as well (data not shown). The marked resistance of the epitope to enzymatic deglycosylation using these enzymes suggests that this band represents a glycoprotein(s) that expresses the O-mannosyl-linked HNK-1 epitope. The HNK-1 epitope has been reported to play a role in cell migration during the development of the nervous system. Therefore, we examined the effect of GnT-Vb expression on cell migration induced in response to a scratch wound. Because suppression of GnT-Vb expression inhibited migration most strongly on laminin (35Abbott K.L. Troupe K. Lee I. Pierce M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2837-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of increased GnT-Vb expression on laminin-coated chamber slides. Confluent cells plated on laminin in serum-free medium were scraped with a yellow pipette tip, and cells"
https://openalex.org/W2137383307,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B (eIF4B) plays a critical role during the initiation of protein synthesis and its activity can be regulated by multiple phosphorylation events. In a search for novel protein kinase B (PKB/c-akt) substrates, we identified eIF4B as a potential target. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we found that PKB can directly phosphorylate eIF4B on serine 422 (ser422). Activation of a conditional PKB mutant, interleukin-3 (IL-3) or insulin stimulation resulted in PKB-dependent phosphorylation of this residue in vivo. This was prevented by pretreatment of cells with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or pharmacological inhibition of PKB. Pretreatment of cells with rapamycin, inhibiting mTOR or U0126 to inhibit MEK, had little effect on eIF4B ser422 phosphorylation. In contrast, following amino-acid refeeding, eIF4B ser422 phosphorylation was found to be mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent. We further identified eIF4B ser406 as a novel mitogen-regulated phosphorylation site. Insulin-induced phosphorylation of eIF4B ser406 was dependent on both MEK and mTOR activity. Utilizing a novel translational control luciferase assay, we could further demonstrate that phosphorylation of ser406 or ser422 is essential for optimal translational activity of eIF4B. These data provide novel insights into complex multikinase regulation of eIF4B phosphorylation and reveal an important mechanism by which PKB can regulate translation, potentially critical for the transforming capacity of this AGC kinase family member."

Here we describe the re-emergence of human HPAI H5N1 virus infections in Vietnam in 2007 and the characteristics of the isolated viruses.Respiratory specimens from patients suspected to be infected with avian influenza in 2007 were screened by influenza and H5 subtype specific polymerase chain reaction. Isolated H5N1 strains were further characterized by genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing. Eleven poultry outbreak isolates from 2007 were included in the sequence analysis. Eight patients, all of them from northern Vietnam, were diagnosed with H5N1 in 2007 and five of them died. Phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 viruses isolated from humans and poultry in 2007 showed that clade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses replaced clade 1 viruses in northern Vietnam. Four human H5N1 strains had eight-fold reduced in-vitro susceptibility to oseltamivir as compared to clade 1 viruses. In two poultry isolates the I117V mutation was found in the neuraminidase gene, which is associated with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir. No mutations in the M2 gene conferring amantadine resistance were found.In 2007, H5N1 clade 2.3.4 viruses replaced clade 1 viruses in northern Vietnam and were susceptible to amantadine but showed reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir. Combination antiviral therapy with oseltamivir and amantadine for human cases in Vietnam is recommended."

We examined the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in modulating colitis.Colitis was induced by administration of dextran sodium sulphate (3% DSS) or streptomycin pre-treated Salmonella typhimurium (S.T.) in wild type (WT) and NPY (NPY(-/-)) knockout mice. Colitis was assessed by clinical score, histological score and myeloperoxidase activity. NPY and nNOS expression was assessed by immunostaining. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring catalase activity, glutathione and nitrite levels. Colonic motility was assessed by isometric muscle recording in WT and DSS-treated mice.DSS/S.T. induced an increase in enteric neuronal NPY and nNOS expression in WT mice. WT mice were more susceptible to inflammation compared to NPY(-/-) as indicated by higher clinical & histological scores, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (p<0.01). DSS-WT mice had increased nitrite, decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and increased catalase activity indicating more oxidative stress. The lower histological scores, MPO and chemokine KC in S.T.-treated nNOS(-/-) and NPY(-/-)/nNOS(-/-) mice supported the finding that loss of NPY-induced nNOS attenuated inflammation. The inflammation resulted in chronic impairment of colonic motility in DSS-WT mice. NPY -treated rat enteric neurons in vitro exhibited increased nitrite and TNF-alpha production.NPY mediated increase in nNOS is a determinant of oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation. Our study highlights the role of neuronal NPY and nNOS as mediators of inflammatory processes in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2010005918,"The seminal ‘two-hit hypothesis’ implicitly assumes that bi-allelic tumour suppressor gene (TSG) mutations cause loss of protein function. All subsequent events in that tumour therefore take place on an essentially null background for that TSG protein. We have shown that the two-hit model requires modification for the APC TSG, because mutant APC proteins probably retain some function and the two hits are co-selected to produce an optimal level of Wnt activation. We wondered whether the optimal Wnt level might change during tumour progression, leading to selection for more than two hits at the APC locus. Comprehensive screening of a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines and primary CRCs showed that some had indeed acquired third hits at APC. These third hits were mostly copy number gains or deletions, but could be protein-truncating mutations. Third hits were significantly less common when the second hit at APC had arisen by copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity. Both polyploid and near-diploid CRCs had third hits, and the third hits did not simply arise as a result of acquiring a polyploid karyotype. The third hits affected mRNA and protein levels, with potential functional consequences for Wnt signalling and tumour growth. Although some third hits were probably secondary to genomic instability, others did appear specifically to target APC. Whilst it is generally believed that tumours develop and progress through stepwise accumulation of mutations in different functional pathways, it also seems that repeated targeting of the same pathway and/or gene is selected in some cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2007735570,"The PTEN tumour suppressor encodes a phosphatase, and its daf-18 orthologue in Caenorhabditis elegans negatively regulates the insulin/IGF-1 DAF-2 receptor pathway that influences lifespan in worms and other species. In order to identify new DAF-18 regulated pathways involved in aging, we initiated a candidate RNAi feeding screen for clones that lengthen lifespan. Here, we report that smg-1 inactivation increases average lifespan in a daf-18 dependent manner. Genetic analysis is consistent with SMG-1 acting at least in part in parallel to the canonical DAF-2 receptor pathway, but converging on the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO. SMG-1 is a serine-threonine kinase which plays a conserved role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in worms and mammals. In addition, human SMG-1 has also been implicated in the p53-mediated response to genotoxic stress. The effect of smg-1 inactivation on lifespan appears to be unrelated to its NMD function, but requires the p53 tumour suppressor orthologue cep-1. Furthermore, smg-1 inactivation confers a resistance to oxidative stress in a daf-18-, daf-16- and cep-1-dependent manner. We propose that the role of SMG-1 in lifespan regulation is at least partly dependent on its function in oxidative stress resistance. Taken together, our results unveil a novel role for SMG-1 in lifespan regulation."

In this study, we provide evidence that BAMBI can enhance the canonical Wnt signaling while knockdown of BAMBI expression impairs Wnt-induced expression of the LEF-luciferase reporter. We showed that BAMBI interacts with Fzd and Dvl and promotes the interaction of Dvl with Fzd. We further found that BAMBI can enhance the Wnt-induced transcription of target genes, cyclin D1 and c-myc, and its overexpression facilitates the G1 to S phase transition. These findings strongly suggest that BAMBI is a positive regulator of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Materials and Plasmids—Human BAMBI (nma) cDNA was generously provided by Dr. G. W. Swart (University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands) and tagged with myc or HA tags at the C terminus and subcloned into pCMV5. The constructs encoding the extracellular-transmembrane domain (aa 1–173) or the transmembrane-intracellular domain (aa 153–260) (with signal peptide, aa 1–20) of BAMBI were generated by PCR and sub-cloned into pCMV with the myc tag at the C terminus. siRNA construct to knock down human BAMBI expression was generated by subcloning into pSUPER vector of the double nucleotide sequences annealed from the following oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-GATCCCCATCTGAGCTCAGCGCCTGCTTCAAGAGAGCAGGCGCTGAGCTCAGATTTTTTGAAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAatctgagctcagcgcctgcTCTCTTGAAgcaggcgctgagctcagatGGG-3′; nonspecific siRNA sequence: 5′-AGCGGACTAAGTCCATTGC-3′. Three domains (DIX: aa 1–110; PDZ: aa 219–390; DEP: aa 420–520) of Dvl2 were cloned into pcs2 FLAG empty vector. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to human BAMBI was prepared by immunizing rabbits with a synthesized peptide (HWGMYSGHGKLEFV). Goat polyclonal antibody against Frizzled 5 and Dvl2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Cell Culture—Hep3B cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and HEK293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RT-PCR Analysis—Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription (RT) at 42 °C for 45 min. RT reaction products (2 μl) were amplified in a 20-μl PCR mixture in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 200 μm dNTPs, 0.5 unit of TaqDNA polymerase, and 0.2 μm specific upstream and downstream primers. The PCR reaction was performed in a Thermocycler (Bio-Rad). PCR was performed with the following primer sets: glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: 5′-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTGT-3′; c-Myc: 5′-CCTACCCTCTAACGACAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCTGACCTTTTGCCAGGAG-3′; cyclin D1: 5′-ATCGAAGCCCTGCTGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GGGAAAGAGCAAAGGAAAA-3′; BAMBI: 5′-ATGGATCGCCACTCCAGC-3′ and 5′-TCATACGAATTCCAGCTTCC-3′; Axin2: 5′-GCCTGCCCAAGGAGATGACCC-3′ and 5′-CTTCGTCGTCTGCTTGGTCAC-3′. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Cells were plated in 24-well dishes at 18 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was measured at 48 h after transfection by using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. Student's t test was performed to assess the significance of treatments versus controls. Asterisks in the figures represent p values of <0.05 to indicate statistical significance. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at 18 h prior to transfection. Transfections were performed with calcium phosphate, and cells were lysed at 4 °C for 10 min with lysis solution (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Aliquots of total cell lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein were precleared for 4 h with protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C. Specific immunoprecipitations of the precleared lysates were carried out in the presence of the appropriate antibody. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, immunoprecipitates were isolated by centrifugation and washed four times with lysis buffer. Protein levels were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the proper antibody and detected with the enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcellular Fractionation—HEK293T cells were harvested by scraping and resuspended in low salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min. The low speed centrifugation was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline three times and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) and lysed by sonification. After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was collected for further analysis. Flow Cytometry—Cells from 60-mm dishes were suspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed by 75% ethanol at –20 °C for >2 h. The fixed cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. RNase A was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then cells were stained by using propidium iodide, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5–10 min and subsequently analyzed with a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. BAMBI Promotes Wnt Signaling—As the β-catenin/TCF complex induces the expression of BAMBI in colorectal and hepatocellular tumor cells (17Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T. Higuchi O. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Nakamura T. Tashiro K. Kuhara S. Ohwada S. Akiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6840-6846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we attempted to investigate whether BAMBI has an effect on Wnt signaling by using the Wnt-responsive LEF-luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 1A, in human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells, LEF-luciferase activity was elevated by co-expression of human BAMBI (left panel). Furthermore, the BAMBI activation of this reporter was further enhanced by Wnt-1 and the promotion of BAMBI on Wnt-1 signaling is dose-dependent (Fig. 1A, right panel). To explore whether BAMBI has a general effect on the transcriptional responses of Wnt-1, the expression of another Wnt-responsive reporter, Topflash-luciferase, was tested in HEK293T cells. The elevation of this reporter activity induced by Wnt-1 was dramatically promoted by co-transfection with BAMBI (Fig. 1B, left panel). This elevation is specific as BAMBI had no effect on Fopflash (Fig. 1B, right panel), which was used as a negative control (28Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Therefore, we concluded from the above data that BAMBI can promote Wnt signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Because ectopic expression of BAMBI increases Wnt signaling, we then asked whether endogenous BAMBI plays any role in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. To this purpose, we generated an siRNA construct against BAMBI (si-BAMBI) and examined its effectiveness on Wnt-1-induced expression of LEF-luciferase in HEK293T cells that express BAMBI protein (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2A, ectopic expression of BAMBI could be effectively knocked down by BAMBI siRNA, but not by a nonspecific control siRNA. To examine whether knockdown of BAMBI expression can decrease Wnt signaling, HEK293T cells were transfected with LEF-luciferase reporter together with BAMBI siRNA or control siRNA, and the transcriptional response of Wnt was assessed by measuring luciferase activity. Consistent with the promoting role of BAMBI, BAMBI siRNA impaired the Wnt-induced expression of LEF-luciferase in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained in hepatoma Hep3B cells: ectopic expression of BAMBI enhanced the Wnt-1-induced expression of LEF-luciferase, whereas BAMBI siRNA attenuated it (Fig. 2C). These data further support the observation that BAMBI is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling. β-Catenin, the key molecule to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling, translocates to the nucleus in the presence of Wnt ligands. To support the above reporter assays, we examined whether BAMBI also enhances the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. HEK293T cells were transfected with various constructs as indicated in Fig. 2D and then the endogenous β-catenin protein in the nuclear fractions was revealed by immunoblotting. Ectopic expression of BAMBI enhanced the protein level of β-catenin in the nucleus in the presence or absence of Wnt, and knocking down of BAMBI expression decreased the nuclear β-catenin level (Fig. 2D). These data are consistent with the stimulating role of BAMBI in the canonical Wnt signaling. BAMBI Interacts with Wnt Signaling Receptors Fzd5 and LRP6—The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling requires two distinct transmembrane receptors Fzd and LRP5/6 (29Cong F. Varmus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because BAMBI is a transmembrane protein and it can increase Wnt signaling, we attempted to test whether BAMBI can associate with Wnt receptors. The interaction of BAMBI with Fzd5 at endogenous protein levels was examined by anti-BAMBI immunoprecipitation and anti-Fzd5 immunoblotting from HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). This interaction was confirmed by ectopically expressed proteins (Fig. 3B) and by reverse immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting analysis with ectopically expressed HA-tagged Fzd5 and myc-tagged BAMBI (Fig. 3C). We further examined whether BAMBI can associate with LRP6 and found that BAMBI could be detected in LRP6 immunoprecipitants (Fig. 3D), indicating that BAMBI can also form a complex with LRP6. The interaction of BAMBI with Fzd5 or LRP6 seems constitutive, because co-expression of Wnt-1 had no effect on their complex formation (data not shown). BAMBI consists of an extracellular domain and an intracellular domain spanned by a transmembrane region. Then, we wanted to define the domain of BAMBI responsible for interacting with the receptors. We generated two BAMBI deletion constructs, which correspond to the extracellular (BAMBI-N) and intracellular (BAMBI-C) domains of BAMBI, respectively (Fig. 3E). Both the extracellular and intracellular domains of BAMBI could bind to Frizzled 5, but only the intracellular domain interacted with LRP6 (Fig. 3E). These data together suggest that BAMBI may form a ternary coreceptor complex with Fzd5 and LRP6. We then tried to explore whether BAMBI is able to promote the complex formation between Fzd5 and LRP6, but could not detect the complex at all the tested conditions (data not shown). Because the intracellular domain of BAMBI can interact with both Fzd5 and LRP6, we wanted to know whether this domain contributes to the promoting effect of BAMBI on Wnt signaling. As shown in Fig. 3F, BAMBI-C mildly enhanced the expression of LEF-luciferase while BAMBI-N showed no effect. BAMBI Binds to Dishevelled—As BAMBI cannot strengthen the interaction between Fzd and LRP, we speculated that BAMBI may promote Wnt signaling by facilitating Dvl recruitment to the membrane receptors and then leading to the disruption of the cytoplasmic destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli, Axin, and GSK3β and thus the stabilization of β-catenin. To test this hypothesis, we first examined whether BAMBI can interact with Dvl, one of the key components of the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-tagged Dvl2 and myc-tagged BAMBI, the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation immunoblotting. BAMBI was found to coimmunoprecipitate with Dvl (Fig. 4A, left panel). And this interaction was further confirmed by reverse immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting (Fig. 4A, right panel) and at the endogenous protein levels (Fig. 4B). To test whether the BAMBI-Dvl2 is specific, we examined the interaction of BAMBI with other Dvl proteins. Our result revealed that BAMBI was able to associate with Dvl1 and Dvl3 as well (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that BAMBI and Dvl associate with each other. Interestingly, BAMBI did not associate with Axin or GSK3β (data not shown). To map the regions mediating the BAMBI-Dvl interaction, we examined the ability of various regions of these two proteins to interact with their counterpart. As expected, Dvl2 interacted only with the intracellular domain but not with the extracellular domain of BAMBI (Fig. 4D). Interestingly, both the PDZ and DEP domains of Dvl2 could interact with BAMBI (Fig. 4E). BAMBI Enhances the Interaction of Fzd5 and Dvl2—The Wnt signal is propagated following the binding of Wnt ligands to a hetero-oligomeric receptor complex consisting of Fzd and LRP5/6 (29Cong F.

However, the interaction between Dvl and Frizzled is apparently weak, and it is unclear whether other proteins are involved in this process. Our above data indicated that BAMBI can associate with Fzd5 and Dvl, thus we studied whether BAMBI could augment the interaction between Fzd5 and Dvl2. The data in Fig. 5A demonstrated that BAMBI promoted the interaction of Fzd5 with Dvl2, which, otherwise, was observed in the absence of Wnt-1. In agreement with this observation, BAMBI could synergize with Dvl2 to enhance Wnt signaling as determined by the expression of LEF-luciferase in HEK293T (Fig. 5B) and in Hep3B (Fig. 5C) cells, respectively. BAMBI Promotes Wnt-induced Cell Growth—Wnt signaling promotes cell proliferation by up-regulating the key mediators of cell cycle, including cyclin D1 and c-myc (35He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C.

A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Then, we examined whether BAMBI could promote cyclin D1 expression by using a luciferase reporter driven by cyclin D1 promoter (36Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar) in HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, BAMBI increased the reporter activity in the presence or absence of Wnt-1, indicating that BAMBI can promote cyclin D1 expression. BAMBI also promoted the luciferase expression driven by the c-myc promoter (Fig. 6B). To investigate whether BAMBI is required for the expression of Wnt target genes, we examined the expression of three well known Wnt targets: cyclin D1, c-myc, and Axin2 after knocking down endogenous BAMBI. The RT-PCR analysis revealed that blocking BAMBI expression by siRNA dramatically decreased the expression of these genes (Fig. 6C). To study the effect of BAMBI on Wnt signaling in a physiological context, HEK293T cells were transfected with BAMBI plasmid together with or without Wnt-1 plasmid. After 48 h cells were harvested and subjected to cell cycle analysis with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. As shown in Fig. 6D, Wnt treatment promoted cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase, and BAMBI overexpression has a similar promoting effect. Importantly, BAMBI enhanced the effect of Wnt-1. BAMBI has been suggested to act as a general antagonist to block signal transduction of the TGF-β family members. Here, we provide evidence that BAMBI can promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We demonstrated that BAMBI enhances the expression of the Wnt-responsive reporters LEF-luciferase and Topflash-luciferase, but not the control Fopflash-luciferase, in the presence or absence of Wnt-1. Consistent with the reporter assay, BAMBI also stimulated the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. We further showed that BAMBI can interact with receptors Fzd5 and LRP6 as well as the intracellular signaling mediator Dvl. The promoting effect of BAMBI on Wnt signaling could result from these interactions, because the association between Fzd and Dvl was increased by BAMBI. Finally, we found that BAMBI also cooperates with Wnt-1 to stimulate the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc and to promote cell cycle progression. It is generally regarded that, upon Wnt binding, the membrane receptor Fzd recruits the cytosolic protein Dvl onto the plasma membrane and the co-receptor LRP5/6 associates with the scaffold protein Axin (3Moon R.T. Kohn A.D. De Ferrari G.V. Kaykas A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 4Clevers H.

These interactions lead to the disruption of the destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli, Axin, GSK3β, casein kinase 1, and others and the accumulation in the nucleus of cytosolic β-catenin, which in turn associates with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and activates transcription of their target genes. We showed here that BAMBI can activate the Wnt-responsive reporters LEF-luciferase and Topflash. Our protein-protein interaction analyses revealed that BAMBI interacts with Fzd5, LRP6, and Dvl, but not with other components in the canonical Wnt pathway we have examined. The intracellular domain of BAMBI is important for the interaction with all three proteins while the extracellular domain can associate only with Fzd, which is consistent with the topological structure of BAMBI as a single-spanned transmembrane protein. It has been demonstrated that Wnt treatment results in the plasma membrane recruitment of Dvl (34Medina A. Steinbeisser H. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the binding of Dvl to Fzd could be relatively weak (40Wong H.C. Bourdelas A. Krauss A. Lee H.J. Shao Y. Wu D. Mlodzik M. Shi D.L. Zheng J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1251-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Our data uncovered that BAMBI can increase the interaction between Fzd and Dvl as this interaction became detectable only in the presence of BAMBI in our experimental condition (Fig. 5A). Therefore, our results together suggest that BAMBI promotes Wnt/β-catenin signaling by facilitating the Fzd-Dvl interaction. Thus, the functional significance of the BAMBI-LRP6 is unclear and needs further investigation. The Wnt signaling pathway is activated in most human cancers. Loss-of-function mutations of adenomatous polyposis coli and stabilization mutations of β-catenin lead to the accumulation of β-catenin (12Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7531-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). It is well documented that β-catenin can promote cell cycle progress and lead to the progression of tumorigenesis through increasing the expression of oncogenes like c-myc and cyclin D1 (35He T.C.

Consistent with its promoting effect on target gene expression, BAMBI could also enhance Wnt-induced cell growth (Fig. 6D). Because BAMBI can act both as an antagonist for TGF-β signaling and as a promoter for Wnt signaling, it is reasonable to postulate that BAMBI can function as a promoter of tumorigenesis. Indeed, this idea is in agreement with the observed up-regulation of BAMBI in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas (17Sekiya T. Adachi S. Kohu K. Yamada T. Higuchi O. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y.

https://openalex.org/W2041596699,"The sandfish (Scincus scincus) is a lizard having the remarkable ability to move through desert sand for significant distances. It is well adapted to living in loose sand by virtue of a combination of morphological and behavioural specializations. We investigated the bodyform of the sandfish using 3D-laserscanning and explored its locomotion in loose desert sand using fast nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging. The sandfish exhibits an in-plane meandering motion with a frequency of about 3 Hz and an amplitude of about half its body length accompanied by swimming-like (or trotting) movements of its limbs. No torsion of the body was observed, a movement required for a digging-behaviour. Simple calculations based on the Janssen model for granular material related to our findings on bodyform and locomotor behaviour render a local decompaction of the sand surrounding the moving sandfish very likely. Thus the sand locally behaves as a viscous fluid and not as a solid material. In this fluidised sand the sandfish is able to “swim” using its limbs."
https://openalex.org/W1969330771,"The Akt signaling pathway activity increases as normal tissue progresses to malignant transformation, and regulates the translation of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) through multiple mechanisms. We have identified one such mechanism of Akt-dependent translation control as involving the lupus autoantigen La. La is an RNA-associated protein that contains multiple trafficking elements to support the interaction with RNAs in different subcellular locations. We show here that the La protein is a direct target of the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt on threonine 301, and La nuclear export in mouse glial progenitors, as well as its association with polysomes is modulated by Akt activity. Using a functional approach to determine the network of genes affected by La in the cytoplasm by microarray analysis of polysome-bound mRNAs, we found that La binds 34% of the polysome bound mRNAs and regulates the expression of a specific pool of mRNAs under KRas/Akt activation. Therefore, La appears to be an important contributor to Akt-mediated translational regulation of these transcripts in murine glial cells."

Our objective was to study impacts of Natalizumab therapy on Foxp3+ T regulatory cells (Tregs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methodology A combined approach of in vitro and ex vivo experiments using T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors and Natalizumab treated MS patients was chosen. We determined binding of Natalizumab and its effects on the frequency, transmigratory behaviour and suppressive function of Tregs. Principal Findings Binding of Natalizumab and expression of CD49d (alpha-4 chain of VLA-4) differed between non-regulatory and regulatory cells. Albeit Foxp3+ Tregs had lower levels of CD49d, Natalizumab blocked the transmigration of Foxp3+ Tregs similar to non-regulatory T cells. The frequency of peripheral blood Tregs was unaffected by Natalizumab treatment. Natalizumab does not alter the suppressive capacity of CD4+CD25highCD127lowFoxp3+ Tregs under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, the impaired function of Tregs in MS patients is not restored by Natalizumab treatment. Conclusions We provide a first detailed analysis of Natalizumab effects on the regulatory T cell population. Our prospective study shows that Foxp3+ Tregs express lower levels of VLA-4 and bind less Natalizumab. We further the understanding of the mechanisms of action of Natalizumab by demonstrating that unlike other immunomodulatory drugs the beneficial therapeutic effects of the monoclonal antibody are largely independent of alterations in Treg frequency or function."
https://openalex.org/W1990543711,"Transgenic mice expressing the Notch 4 intracellular domain (ICD) (Int3) in the mammary gland have two phenotypes: arrest of mammary alveolar/lobular development and mammary tumorigenesis. Notch4 signaling is mediated primarily through the interaction of Int3 with the transcription repressor/activator Rbpj. We have conditionally ablated the Rbpj gene in the mammary glands of mice expressing whey acidic protein (Wap)-Int3. Interestingly, Rbpj knockout mice (Wap-Cre(+)/Rbpj(-/-)/Wap-Int3) have normal mammary gland development, suggesting that the effect of endogenous Notch signaling on mammary gland development is complete by day 15 of pregnancy. RBP-J heterozygous (Wap-Cre(+)/Rbpj(-/+)/Wap-Int3) and Rbpj control (Rbpj(flox/flox)/Wap-Int3) mice are phenotypically the same as Wap-Int3 mice with respect to mammary gland development and tumorigenesis. In addition, the Wap-Cre(+)/Rbpj(-/-)/Wap-Int3-knockout mice also developed mammary tumors at a frequency similar to Rbpj heterozygous and Wap-Int3 control mice but with a slightly longer latency. Thus, the effect on mammary gland development is dependent on the interaction of the Notch ICD with the transcription repressor/activator Rbpj, and Notch-induced mammary tumor development is independent of this interaction."

Fgd2 (faciogenital dysplasia 2) is a novel gene discovered by PCR amplification using primer sequences based on the Fgd1 gene (1Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Genomics. 1999; 60: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and is a member of a small subfamily of predicted RhoGEFs (including Fgd1, Fgd3, Fgd4 (Frabin), Fgd5, and Fgd6) with C-terminal amino acid homology but highly divergent N-terminal extensions. The Fgd subfamily is part of a larger family of 69 genes with homology to Dbl, a transforming gene identified in diffuse B cell lymphomas (2Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). RhoGEFs are activators of the Rho (Ras homology) subfamily of GTPases, such as Rac1 to -3, RhoA to -G, and Cdc42, because they are GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs). 4The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; BCR, B cell antigen receptor; PH, pleckstrin homology; DH, Dbl homology; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; TRX, thioredoxin; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescence protein. As such, they catalyze the release of bound GDP from the GTPases, resulting in the formation of GTP-bound active proteins able to interact with downstream effectors (2Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Depending on their subcellular localization and interaction with specific GTPases, they can thus control disparate biological activities, including adhesion, mitosis, cellular polarization, and vesicle trafficking (3Buchsbaum R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1149-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All Dbl RhoGEF family members carry a signature active site motif composed of tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Substrate specificity is dictated by a “specificity patch” within the DH domain (4Snyder J.T. Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Betts L. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Sondek J. Nat. Struct.

Further domains that influence function, molecular interactions, and cellular localization distinguish RhoGEFs from one another. Among Dbl family proteins, Fgd family members are unique in carrying a FYVE motif (shared in Fab1, YotB, Vac1p, and EEA1) and an additional PH domain at the C terminus. FYVE domains are zinc finger lipid binding motifs that often target proteins to vesicles by interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (9Patki V. Virbasius J. Lane W.S. Toh B.H. Shpetner H.S.

PH domain-containing proteins often bind to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), leading to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class I-dependent plasma membrane recruitment and possible protein conformational changes (14Ferguson K.M.

Although annotated in genetic data bases, Fgd5 and Fgd6 are so far uncharacterized. Apart from inferences based on sequence homology, little is known about the protein function of FGD2. A recent study indicates that a mutant form of Fgd2 contributes to t-complex ratio distortion, a phenomenon found in some wild strains of mice where decreased motility of sperm is caused by the actions of several genes located in a variant region of chromosome 17 (22Bauer H. Veron N. Willert J. Herrmann B.G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The Fgd2 locus also maps to Idd23, a region of chromosome 17 where the C57BL/6 allele is implicated in the protection from diabetes in the NOD mouse model of diabetes (23Deruytter N. Boulard O. Garchon H.J. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 3323-3327Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the first biochemical characterization of FGD2, including an assessment of its predominant expression in leukocyte subsets, regulation in B cells by B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, enzymatic activity, and subcellular localization. We show that FGD2 is the sole member of the characterized Fgd family that can localize to early endocytic vesicles. Cloning Mouse Fgd2—Total RNA was harvested from mouse spleen (strain B10.D2/SnJ) using TRIzol (Life Technologies), and cDNA was generated using the SuperScript first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fgd2 cDNA was amplified using PLATINUM Pfx DNA polymerase enzyme (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following primers: 5′-TACTCAAGCTTAGGATGGAGCGAGCCTGTGAG and 5′-TGATCACTCGAGATTTCATGATCCAGGGATA. The sequence for mouse Fgd2 from B10.D2 mice had several changes from the published sequence (1Pasteris N.G. Gorski J.L. Genomics. 1999; 60: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and concurred with the C57BL/6 genomic sequence and cDNA sequences AK042260 and AY301264 (NCBI GenBank™) with two exceptions. The predicted amino acids Ser39 and Glu543 of C57BL/6J origin were changed to isoleucine and aspartic acid, respectively. The B10.D2/SnJ cDNA sequence has been deposited in GenBank™ (DQ344523). Fgd2 cDNA was subcloned into pCMVTag2b and pEGFP-C3 for expression analysis with FLAG and EGFP epitope tags, respectively. A QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used to generate two FGD2 point mutants. FYVEKT contained full-length FGD2 with mutations in the FYVE domain (Gln454 → Lys, Trp455 → Thr), and GEFAA contained mutations in the DH domain (Ser28 → Ala and Asn288 → Ala). In addition, truncation constructs of FGD2 containing only the DH and PH domains (DHPH) of FGD2 (residues 99–418) and a mutant lacking the C-terminal PH domain (FGD2ΔPH2) of FGD2 (residues 1–526) were also generated. A schematic diagram showing the mutants used in this study is provided in Fig. 5C. Antibodies—Polyclonal antiserum to FGD2 was generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant FGD2 fused to thioredoxin (TRX-FGD2) and a poly-His sequence using the pET32 expression vector (Novagen).

A. 1982; 79: 4737-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) were also used. For confocal microscopy stains, EEA1 (clone 14/EEA1; BD Biosciences), GM130 (clone 35/GM130; BD Biosciences), LAMP2 (H4B4; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), cortactin (clone 4F11; Upstate Biotechnology), Cdc42 (sc-87; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Rac1 (23A8; Upstate Biotechnology), RhoA-C (06-770; Upstate Biotechnology), rhodamine, or Alexa 647-labeled phalloidin (Invitrogen) and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) were used. Cell Culture—HEK293, COS-7, and HeLa cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured using L cell-conditioned medium essentially as described (25Vairo G. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium was used instead of RPMI 1640. The principle method for generating bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with GM-CSF was as described (26Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rossner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar). Following 10 days of culture in 200 units/ml GM-CSF, nonadherent bone marrow cells were then cultured a further 2 days in GM-CSF (100 units/ml) and 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (055: B5) (LPS; Sigma). Western Analysis of FGD2 Expression—Whole cell lysates from thymocytes, pooled lymph nodes, total bone marrow, bone marrow-derived macrophages, bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, splenocytes, and splenocytes either B220-enriched or -depleted using magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) were generated from B10.D2 mice using 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Insoluble nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, followed by Western blotting and detection using a polyclonal rabbit anti-FGD2 antiserum or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody. A mouse tissue INSTA-Blot (Imgenex) containing immobilized brain, heart, small intestine, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, stomach, spleen, ovary, and testis lysates was also probed with the polyclonal rabbit anti-FGD2 antiserum, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression with Stimulation—Immature B cells from 3-83 BCR Tg mice were expanded from bone marrow using interleukin-7 cultures as described (27Verkoczy L. Ait-Azzouzene D. Skog P. Martensson A. Lang J. Duong B. Nemazee D. Immunity. 2005; 22: 519-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). One day after interleukin-7 removal, 20 μg/ml either anti-BCR antibody (S23) or control (Y3) antibody was added to the cells for the indicated times. Mature B cells were purified from spleen and lymph nodes from B10.D2 mice using negative selection with CD43 MACS beads and columns (Miltenyi Biotec). CD43-B cells were cultured at 1 × 107 cells/ml with either 10 μg/ml goat F(ab)2 anti-mouse IgM (Jackson Immunochemicals) or LPS (1 μg/ml) and incubated at 37 °C for various time points prior to lysis and analysis by Western blotting. Real Time PCR Analyses of mRNA Expression—Pro-B cells were isolated by cell sorting from bone marrow cells of RAG1–/– mice, where B220+CD43+ were positively selected. Pre-B cells from bone marrow of B10.D2SnJ mice were sorted using the markers B220+ CD43– IgM– IgD–. Immature B cells were isolated from B10.D2 mice carrying the 3-83 BCR transgene (28Russell D.M. Dembic Z. Morahan G. Miller J.F. Burki K. Nemazee D. Nature. 1991; 354: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and were sorted for B220+ IgM+ IgD– CD43– marked cells. Immature B cells undergoing receptor editing were isolated from B10.Br 3-83 transgenic bone marrow, where B10.Br mice express the BCR antigen H-2k in the bone marrow. Cells were sorted for B220+ IgD– CD43– IgM–. B220+ cells from spleen and pooled lymph nodes were isolated using B220 magnetic bead separation (Miltenyi). Total RNA was purified from sorted B cell subsets using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed by DNase I digestion. First strand cDNA was generated using oligo(dT) and the Superscript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) before Fgd2 and β-actin were amplified. A 158-bp amplicon for actin was amplified using primers 5′-gcattgctgacaggatgcag and 5′-CCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATC annealing at 57 °C. Fgd2 was amplified using primers 5′-AGGAACCTGAGGAGAAGAGGGTC and 5′-gcgtggaaacgatagatggaggag, annealing at 57 °C, yielding a 189-bp product. The PCRs were performed in triplicate using the 7900 HT Applied Biosystems machine and quantified using the Sybr green PCR kit (Qiagen). Ct values for each reaction were generated using the SDS software (Applied Biosystems). Fgd2 Ct values were subtracted from actin, and mean results were expressed as the exponential product ratio. Northern Analysis of Fgd2 Expression—20 μg of total RNA isolated from immature B cells cultured with or without anti-BCR antibody for 24 h was electrophoresed under denaturing conditions. After photographing the RNA gel stained with ethidium bromide, the RNA was transferred to a nylon Zeta probe membrane (Bio-Rad) before UV cross-linking and probing with an Fgd2 cDNA probe generated using the primers 5′-CTTCCAGGAGGTGGTCACCCG and 5′-AACCAGGTAGCGTTCCATTG. Cdc42 Activation Assay—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected by Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) mixed with cDNA encoding Myc-tagged Cdc42, EGFP, EGFP-tagged Fgd2, or EGFP-tagged Fgd2 mutants. The dominant active mutant EGFP-Cdc42Q61L and the dominant negative mutant, EGFP-Cdc42T17N, were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Active Cdc42 was assessed by a pull-down assay, as described (29Stofega M. DerMardirossian C. Bokoch G.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 332: 269-279PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were precleared with GST bound to glutathione beads for 10 min, prior to incubation for 1 h with ACK1 (activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1)-Crib (Cdc42- and Rac1-interacting binding) (amino acids 439–502)-GST fusion protein bound to glutathione beads. After washing three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40), beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Bead-associated active Cdc42 was detected using anti-Myc and anti-EGFP antibodies. Rac1 and RhoA activity assay kits containing PAK-Crib GST and Rhotekin-RBD GST beads, respectively, were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (now Millipore) and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. JNK1 Activity Assays—HEK293 or COS7 cells were transiently transfected with FLAG-JNK1 together with EGFP or various EGFP-FGD2 mutants in the presence of either Cdc42 or Rac1. JNK1 activity assays were performed as described (30Sanna M.G. Duckett C.S. Richter B.W. Thompson C.B. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6015-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) by immunoprecipitation of JNK1 with anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) and incubation of [γ-32P]ATP with a GST-ATF-2 fusion protein as substrate. Phosphorylated ATF-2 was determined by autoradiography, and the amounts of expressed proteins were determined by Western blotting of total cellular lysates. Confocal Microscopy Imaging of Fgd2 Localization—Transiently transfected HeLa cells that had adhered to polylysine- or fibronectin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with 3.4% paraformaldehyde. In some cases, transfected HeLa cells were incubated with either 50 nm wortmannin (Calbiochem) in DMSO or DMSO alone for 30 min prior to fixation and staining. For actin stains, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (phalloidin and cortactin stains). For intracellular compartment stains, the cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin prior to staining. After the samples were mounted with Immuno-Fluore mounting medium (MP Biomedicals Inc.), coverslips were visualized by fluorescence microscopy with an MC1024 (Bio-Rad) confocal laser microscope. The EGFP-FGD2 colocalization with intracellular stained compartments was determined using LSM examiner software (Zeiss). Phospholipid Binding Membranes—Recombinant His-tagged thioredoxin-FGD2 (pET32 expression vector (Novagen)) or fusion partner thioredoxin alone were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. The recombinant FGD2 protein was insoluble and was solubilized with 8 m urea and gradually dialyzed into a final buffer of 25 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100 over 3 days. Purified proteins were incubated with PIP Array membranes (Molecular Probes and Invitrogen) at 0.5 μg/ml for 2 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, bound proteins were detected with an anti-His epitope antibody (Sigma) and chemiluminescence. Fgd2 Is Expressed in Primary Lymphoid Cells—When immature B cells encounter self-antigen, they can undergo secondary recombination of the κ light chain locus, to produce an innocuous surface antigen receptor, a tolerance process known as receptor editing (31Nemazee D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 728-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To generate large numbers of immature B cells with uniform receptors, we cultured bone marrow from 3-83 BCR transgenic mice in which immature B cells express a prerearranged receptor against H-2Kk antigen (32Nemazee D.A. Burki K. Nature. 1989; 337: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In order to identify genes that were differentially expressed between immature B cells and immature B cells forced to undergo receptor editing by exposure to anti-BCR antibodies in vitro, we performed a PCR-based total gene expression analysis screen (33Sutcliffe, J. G., Foye, P. E., Erlander, M. G., Hilbush, B. S., Bodzin, L. J., Durham, J. T., and Hasel, K. W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 97, 1976–1981Google Scholar). In this screen, we identified Fgd2 as a candidate RNA that was expressed in immature B cells but was poorly expressed in editing B cells. These findings were also confirmed by Affymetrix chip analysis of U94B arrays with the probe set 115754_at (data not shown). Perusal of the Symatlas data base (34Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. Patapoutian A. Hampton G.M. Schultz P.G. Hogenesch J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar) indicated that Fgd2 mRNA expression was concentrated in lymphoid tissues rich in B cells. We therefore wanted to assess FGD2 protein expression in lymphoid tissues or isolated leukocyte subsets. To this end, an FGD2-specific rabbit antiserum was prepared. The antiserum's specificity for FGD2 was clear, because, although it could bind to recombinant epitope-tagged FGD2 expressed in HEK293 cells in Western blots, it failed to detect the related FGD1 protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 5 and 6) and FGD3 (not shown). By contrast, both FGD1 and FGD2 could be detected when probed with antibodies directed to their N-terminal FLAG epitope tag (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9). Furthermore, FGD2 has a distinctly lower predicted molecular weight (Mr 74,600) than all other Fgd family members, including FGD1 (Mr 105,000) (Fig. 1A, lanes 8 and 9). In addition, the preimmune sera did not detect any proteins in the HEK293 lysates (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–3). This rabbit-derived antiserum was used in Western blotting of whole cell lysates prepared from mouse thymus, pooled lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen and magnetically separated CD45R+ (B220+) and B220– splenic cells. No reactivity was detected in lysates of unfractionated bone marrow or thymus (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3), whereas high level expression was evident in lymph nodes and spleen (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 6), consistent with the high levels of mRNA expressed in these latter tissues. B220+ splenic cells were enriched, whereas B220– splenic cells were depleted of immunoreactive FGD2 protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that B cells are the major source of FGD2 in the spleen. In addition, in lysates prepared from macrophages and dendritic cells that were expanded from bone marrow by stimulation with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or GM-CSF, respectively, FGD2 expression was detectable (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5). The expression of FGD2 in nonleukocyte tissues was tested by probing an INSTA-Blot mouse tissue membrane (Imgenex). We were unable to detect FGD2 protein in brain, liver, kidney, testis, muscle, ovary, or small intestine but did confirm splenic expression in this assay (data not shown). These experiments indicate that leukocytes express FGD2, and that in lymphoid tissues, B lymphocytes and myeloid cells, in particular macrophages, also express the protein. Fgd2 mRNA Expression and Regulation in B Lymphocyte Development—Because we were initially interested in identifying genes that were regulated during B lymphocyte development and selection, and Western blotting and array analysis indicated that Fgd2 expression was particularly high in B cells, we carried out a more detailed analysis of the developmental regulation and response to antigen receptor signaling of its RNA expression. A Northern blot assay confirmed that Fgd2 is differentially expressed in interleukin-7-expanded primary immature B lymphocytes. Fig. 2A shows that immature B cells treated with anti-BCR antibodies (+) for 24 h in vitro had low level expression of Fgd2 mRNA relative to control IgG-treated cells (–). To determine if BCR signaling affected Fgd2 expression in vivo, immature bone marrow B cells were directly sorted from 3-83 BCR transgenic mice that expressed or lacked cognate autoantigen (32Nemazee D.A. Burki K. Nature. 1989; 337: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Immature bone marrow B cells differed in their levels of Fgd2 mRNA depending on whether cognate self-antigen was absent (Fig. 2B, Imm) or present (Edit). These data confirmed in ex vivo cells that BCR ligation by self-antigen suppressed Fgd2 expression in immature B cells. We also compared Fgd2 levels in other B lineage subsets. Sorted pre-B cells (CD43–B220+sIg–) expressed low levels of Fgd2, whereas pro-B cells (CD43+B220+sIg–) expressed high levels. Mature B lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes expressed high levels of Fgd2 mRNA (Fig. 2B). We conclude that Fgd2 expression changes strikingly with preimmune developmental progression and that BCR ligation can alter Fgd2 expression in the bone marrow, probably by inducing developmental arrest. FGD2 Protein Expression in B Cells Is Regulated by a BCR-specific Signal—Since we found Fgd2 mRNA to be repressed in immature B cells undergoing tolerance-induced receptor editing, we were interested in whether this was also true for the protein level in both immature and mature B cells. We therefore used Western blotting with FGD2 antiserum to assess FGD2 protein expression and regulation in primary mouse B cells stimulated with anti-BCR antibody. Immunoblotting analysis carried out with lysates from both immature (Fig. 3A) and mature splenic B cells (Fig. 3B) cultured up to 24 h with or without anti-BCR antibodies revealed that anti-BCR-treated cells had strikingly lower FGD2 protein expression (Fig. 3, A and B), which correlated with the changes observed in RNA expression (Fig. 2A). FGD2 protein expression in immature B cells was suppressed after 24 h of BCR stimulation (Fig. 3A, left panels) but was unaffected by the presence of a control antibody (Fig. 3A, right panels). Similarly, mature splenic B cells down-regulated FGD2 protein expression upon BCR stimulation, albeit with faster kinetics (Fig. 3B, left panels). To test if the repression of FGD2 was specific to a BCR-mediated signal or could also be mediated by a different mitogenic signal, such as signals mediated by Toll-like receptors, we stimulated splenic B cells with the mitogen LPS. This treatment failed to down-regulate FGD2 expression (Fig. 3B, right panels), and we therefore conclude that FGD2 protein down-regulation is the result of a BCR-specific signal.

Our data suggest that specific residues of the third YidC transmembrane segment α-helix is oriented toward the transmembrane domains of nascent inner membrane proteins that, in contrast, appear quite flexibly positioned at this stage in biogenesis. Approximately 20% of the proteins encoded by the Escherichia coli genome are destined for the inner membrane. It is generally assumed that the Sec-translocon is required for the insertion of most inner membrane proteins (IMPs), 2The abbreviations used are: IMP, inner membrane protein; BMOE, Bis-maleimidoethane; BMH, Bis-maleimidohexane; BPM, benzophenone-4-maleimide; CuPhe, Cu2+[phenanthroline]2; IMV, inverted inner membrane vesicle; TM, transmembrane segment; CBP, calmodulin-binding peptide. although a recent proteomic analysis showed that a defective Sec-translocon has surprisingly little effect on the steady state levels of most IMPs (1.Baars L.

The core of the Sec-translocon consists of the integral IMPs SecY, SecE, and SecG. SecD, SecF, and YajC form an accessory complex that facilitates protein insertion and translocation but is not essential for survival (2.Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3.Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, the essential IMP YidC was co-purified with the Sec-translocon (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). YidC has been characterized as an evolutionary conserved factor that is involved in the integration of many IMPs, including those that insert independent from the Sec-translocon (2.Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3.Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The exact function of YidC is unknown. Cross-linking studies have indicated that YidC contacts the transmembrane segments (TMs) of substrate IMPs upon their lateral exit from the Sec-translocon to facilitate their integration into the lipid bilayer (5.Houben E.N. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 970-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.W.

EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the biogenesis of CyoA (subunit II of the cytochrome o oxidase) have shown that YidC can also function upstream of the Sec-translocon in the initial insertion of the N-terminal region of nascent CyoA followed by translocation of the (more complex) C-terminal domain by the Sec-translocon (8.Van Bloois E.

Furthermore, YidC has been implicated in the folding and quality control of Sec-dependent IMPs (5.Houben E.N. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Strikingly, YidC is also able to function as an insertase for small proteins such as F0c (the subunit c of F1F0-ATPase) and M13 and Pf3 phage coat proteins (2.Luirink J. von Heijne G. Houben E. de Gier J.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 59: 329-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3.Xie K. Dalbey R.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism and timing of the recognition of substrate TMs by YidC both in its Sec-dependent and -independent operational mode. To address directly which region of YidC is involved in substrate recognition, we have used an in vitro site-specific cross-linking approach. We have found that during membrane integration, the TMs of several tested Sec-dependent and -independent IMPs are adjacent to a specific region in YidC TM3 that belongs to the most conserved part of YidC. The TM in the nascent substrate is flexibly oriented toward YidC, both lateral and vertical, whereas YidC TM3 displays a fixed orientation toward its substrate. We hypothesize that TM3 is (part of) a generic docking site for hydrophobic domains in growing nascent IMPs and provides a protected environment that facilitates their lipid partitioning and folding.

Phenanthroline, N-ethylmaleimide, and all other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Antisera against YidC, PspA, and Lep have been described previously or were from our own collection (13.Van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J.

Tommassen J. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 900: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Strain Top10F′ (Invitrogen) was used for routine cloning and maintenance of plasmid constructs. Strain JS7131, in which yidC is under the control of the araBAD operator/promoter, was used to express YidC cysteine mutants (15.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). pCL1921YidC-StrepII-CBP derivatives encoding the YidC cysteine mutants were constructed as follows. The coding region for the calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP) was PCR-amplified from pCalKC (Stratagene) with a forward primer containing a SacI restriction site and the Streptavidine tag II sequence and with a reverse primer containing the EcoRI restriction site (primer sequences available upon request). The PCR product was digested with SacI and EcoRI and introduced 3′ of the yidC gene into pEH1YidC (16.Urbanus M.L. Fröderberg L. Drew D. Bjork P. De Gier J.W. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12718-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), resulting in pEH1YidC-StrepII-CBP. This plasmid was digested with KpnI and EcoRI, and the restriction product containing the 3′ end of YidC gene with the StrepII-CBP tag was cloned into the low copy plasmid pCL1921YidC (17.Lerner C.G. Inouye M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4631Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), replacing the 3′ end of YidC, resulting in pCL1921YidC-StrepII-CBP (we will refer to this plasmid as pCLYidC). The plasmid pCLYidC was used as a template for constructing single cysteine mutants in the YidC gene using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). First, the codon for cysteine 423 was changed into an alanine codon resulting in pCLYidC C423A. This plasmid was subsequently used as a template to construct further single cysteine mutants in yidC gene. The nucleotide sequences of the mutant genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing. YidC wild type and cysteine derivatives (see Table 1) were expressed in the YidC depletion strain JS7131 carrying pEH3. pEH3 encodes the LacI repressor and is used to minimize leakage expression from the pCLYidC plasmid. Expression from pCLYidC was induced by 200 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Strains were used to make IMVs for insertion assays (14.De Vrije T. Tommassen J. De Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys.

Translation and membrane integration of nascent chains were carried out as described previously (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Long range cysteine cross-linking was carried out with BMOE (1 mm) or BMH (0.5 mm) for 10 min at 25 °C and quenched with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min on ice. To separate integral membrane from soluble and peripheral cross-linked complexes, the samples were extracted with 0.18 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.5). The carbonate pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Short range cysteine cross-linking was induced with 1 mm Cu2+[phenanthroline]2 (CuPhe) for 10 min at 25 °C and subsequently quenched with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min on ice. CuPhe was prepared as described previously (19.Kaufmann A. Manting E.H. Veenendaal A.K. Driessen A.J. Van der Does C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9115-9125Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the carbonate-resistant fraction was dissolved in SDS sample buffer without dithiothreitol. For photocross-linking, nascent chains (prepared as described previously (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)) and BPM (1 mm) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C and quenched with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide on ice for 10 min. Subsequently, the nascent chains were purified through a high salt sucrose cushion (500 mm KOAc, 500 mm sucrose, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9) and resuspended in RN buffer (100 mm KOAc, 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9). IMVs were added to allow targeting and integration into the membrane, and the samples were UV-irradiated to induce cross-linking to membrane components as described previously (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The carbonate pellet fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by phosporimaging using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 473. Experimental Strategy—To investigate the interaction of YidC with nascent IMPs during their insertion into the E. coli inner membrane, we have cross-linked integration intermediates in an in vitro approach (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In this technique, translation of a truncated mRNA (a mRNA that lacks a stop codon) is translated in a cell-free E. coli extract to produce nascent, ribosome-bound polypeptides of predefined length. Translation is carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine to label the nascent chains, and IMVs are added to allow co-translational insertion of the nascent IMP into the Sec/YidC-translocon or YidC insertase. Upon insertion, interactions of the nascent chain and the translocon/insertase are probed by cross-linking using homo-bifunctional cysteine specific reagents. Introduction of single cysteines in both the nascent chain and the interacting partner protein makes the procedure site-specific. Thus, this approach yields spatial information regarding the proximity of the integration intermediate and its partner at the residue level. The integration intermediates used in this study were derived from the model IMPs FtsQ, leader peptidase (Lep), and the F0c subunit of the F1F0-ATPase. FtsQ is a single spanning, type II IMP involved in cell division (see Fig. 3A) (20.Goehring N.W. Beckwith J. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: R514-R526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Lep, the major signal peptidase, spans the membrane twice with translocated N and C termini (see Fig. 6A). F0c has the same topology as Lep but comprises a much shorter translocated C terminus (Fig. 7A). FtsQ and Lep have been shown to use the Sec/YidC-translocon for membrane integration (4.Scotti P.A.

De Gier J.W. Von Heijne G. Kendall D.A. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Oudega B. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The FtsQ TM inserts initially at SecY moving to a combined YidC/lipid environment upon elongation as suggested by sequential contacts during insertion of nascent FtsQ (6.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). For instance, a relatively long nascent FtsQ of 108 amino acids harboring a photo-probe at position 40 in the TM was shown to primarily cross-link YidC. Furthermore, 108FtsQ with a single cysteine engineered at position 40 was shown to cross-link YidC reconstituted in proteoliposomes together with SecYEG using the homo-bifunctional cysteine specific cross-linker BMOE (8 Å) (25.Van der Laan M. Houben E.N. Nouwen N. Luirink J. Driessen A.J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because YidC only contains one cysteine at position 423 in the third TM, this observation implied that TM3 of YidC is close to the TM of nascent FtsQ at this stage in the integration process. Interestingly, TM3 belongs (together with TM2) to the most conserved regions in the Oxa1/Alb3/YidC family members (26.Kiefer D. Kuhn A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 259: 113-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To examine the proximity between YidC TM3/TM2 and nascent IMPs in more detail, we have used cysteine scanning cross-linking. First, the single endogenous cysteine in YidC was replaced by alanine to generate cysteine-free YidC. This derivative served as a negative control in our cross-link studies and as a starting point to introduce single cysteine residues at selected positions in TM3 and TM2 (Table 1), covering more than two turns of the presumably α-helical TM3 structure and one turn in TM2 (Fig. 1, B and C). All of the yidC constructs were cloned in the low copy expression vector pCL1921 under lac promoter control. To distinguish the plasmid-encoded YidC derivatives from endogenous YidC, a StrepII-CBP tag was added at the C terminus of all constructs, increasing the size of YidC by ∼5 kDa. Tagged YidC that contains the cysteine at position 423 will be further referred to as wild type. Functionality of the YidC derivatives was assessed by investigating their ability to complement the in vivo growth defect that accompanies depletion of YidC. To this end, the constructs were introduced in the YidC depletion strain JS7131 in which expression of the chromosomal yidC is under control of the araBAD promoter (15.Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Möller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Complementation was assayed on solid medium in the absence of l-arabinose to repress the chromosomal yidC but in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce expression of the plasmid-encoded yidC derivative (Fig. 2A). As a control, JS7131 transformed with the cloning vector only grew on the plate containing l-arabinose as expected. pCL1921 encoding wild type YidC complemented growth in the absence of l-arabinose, indicating that YidC with a C-terminal StrepII-CBP tag is functional, consistent with the permissive nature of the C-terminus of YidC with respect to alterations (16.Urbanus M.L. Fröderberg L. Drew D. Bjork P. De Gier J.W. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12718-12723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 27.Jiang F. Chen M. Yi L. De Gier J.W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48965-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Importantly, all plasmid-encoded single cysteine YidC mutants were able to complement growth of JS7131 in the absence of l-arabinose, indicating that they are functional. For in vitro cross-link experiments, IMVs were prepared of all JS7131 derivatives grown in liquid LB in the absence of l-arabinose and the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to specifically express the plasmid-encoded YidC. YidC was detected in the IMVs of all mutants, albeit at different levels for reasons that are unknown. As expected, the YidC mutants ran slower in SDS-PAGE compared with untagged YidC (faintly visible in the empty pCL vector control) (Fig. 2B). We have shown previously that depletion of YidC leads to up-regulation of PspA, which is in part associated with the inner membrane (13.Van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PspA is a stress protein that responds to dissipation of the proton motive force (28.Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). YidC depletion affects the proton motive force by defects in the functional assembly of the F1F0-ATPase and the cytochrome o oxidase (13.Van der Laan M. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Nouwen N. Oudega B. Harms N. Driessen A.J. Luirink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5801-5806Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 29.Van der Laan M. Nouwen N.P. Driessen A.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, the induction of PspA seen in the empty pCL vector control is completely prevented by expression of all YidC derivatives. This indicates that all of the mutants are able to sustain the proton motive force and are functional in the assembly of respiratory chain complexes. Together, the data suggest that the YidC derivatives, although for unknown reasons expressed at different levels compared with the Lep loading control (Fig. 2B), are functional. The TM of 108FtsQ Inserts in Proximity of YidC TM3—To probe the environment of the TM in the 108FtsQ integration intermediate near YidC TM3, 108FtsQCys40 (Fig. 3B) was inserted in IMVs that contain YidC derivatives with single cysteine substitutions in TM3 (Fig. 1C). Upon integration, the samples were cross-linked using the homo-bifunctional cysteine-specific reagent BMOE. Strong and specific cross-linking was observed to YidC (verified by immunoprecipitation, not shown) harboring a cysteine at positions 425, 426, 429, or, to a lesser extent, 424 (Fig. 3C). No adducts were observed in the absence of BMOE (not shown) or when using IMVs that contain the cysteine-less YidC mutant (Fig. 3C), confirming the specificity of the procedure. Notably, the positions that strongly cross-link to 108FtsQCys40 seem to cluster at one side of the putative α-helical YidC TM3, although more positions should be analyzed to confirm this notion (Fig. 1C). To rule out that, despite their functionality, some YidC mutants are structurally altered in such a way that they are no longer in proximity of nascent 108FtsQCys40, cross-linking was performed with the hetero-bifunctional reagent BPM. BPM reacts with the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues via a maleimide moiety. Upon ultraviolet irradiation, a reactive species is generated that can form covalent bonds with nearby groups. The linker arm connecting the two reactive groups is ∼10 Å. 108FtsQCys40 nascent chains were produced, purified through a high salt sucrose cushion, and incubated with BPM to allow cross-linking to the Cys40 residue. Subsequently, the samples were incubated with β-mercaptoethanol to quench cysteine cross-linking. Then IMVs were added for membrane integration of 108FtsQCys40-BPM, and the samples were UV-irradiated to induce cross-linking to membrane components independent of closely spaced cysteine residues. By this procedure, all of the YidC derivatives were cross-linked to the FtsQ integration intermediate (Fig. 3D). In this and the following experiments, no YidC cross-linking adducts were observed in the absence of cross-linkers (data not shown). This shows that the IMVs with the YidC derivatives are still functional in accommodating nascent 108FtsQCys40 in accordance with the in vivo complementation data described above. The TM of 108FtsQ Is Dynamically Oriented Relative to YidC TM3—To obtain more spatial and structural information regarding the proximity of the TM in 108FtsQ and YidC TM3, four additional mutants were constructed that have single cysteines in the TM of 108FtsQ at positions 36, 39, 41, and 42 (Fig. 3B). These mutant nascent chains were integrated in the IMVs that contain YidC derivatives with single cysteine substitutions in TM3 (Fig. 1C) and cross-linked with BMOE. Interestingly, the cross-link patterns are very similar to that of 108FtsQCys40, i.e. cross-linking to YidC positions 425, 426, 429, and, to a lesser extent, 424 (Fig. 4A). Cross-linking is most efficient at position 425 except for 108FtsQCys36 where cross-linking peaks at position 426. The similarity in cross-linking profiles for all of the tested positions in the TM of 108FtsQ indicates that the FtsQ TM does not occupy a fixed position relative to YidC TM3. Rather, the FtsQ TM seems to orient itself flexibly along the more rigid YidC TM3 perpendicular to the plane of the membrane. Importantly, the analyzed region of the FtsQ TM did not show a clear helical asymmetry in cross-linking to YidC TM3. This could mean that the TM in the FtsQ integration intermediate has not yet adopted an α-helical conformation but rather constitutes a randomly coiled stretch of residues that is able to reposition up and down relative to YidC TM3. Alternatively, the FtsQ TM is α-helical at this stage, but the helix has sufficient flexibility and space to rotate relative to YidC TM3. Finally, it cannot be excluded that the YidC TM3 docking site may have some mobility toward its substrate. To verify that in this approach cross-linking to YidC TM3 is specific for the TM of 108FtsQ, single cysteines were introduced at positions 15 and 60 located in hydrophilic regions that flank the FtsQ TM. As expected, BMOE cross-linking yielded no YidC adducts (supplemental Fig. S1), consistent with previous photo cross-link data in which probes engineered at positions 10 and 59 of 108FtsQ did not show significant cross-linking to any region of YidC (4.Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Together, the data indicate that the TM of membrane-integrated 108FtsQ contacts YidC TM3 with a high degree of conformational freedom. The TM of 108FtsQ Is Held at YidC TM3 during Membrane Integration—Next, we examined the effect of nascent chain length on the proximity between the FtsQ TM and YidC TM3. Previously, we have shown by photo cross-linking that the FtsQ TM in nascent chains as short as 97 residues contacts YidC (6.Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Fröderberg L. Sääf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). With our set of YidC cysteine mutants, we were now able to specifically examine the effect of nascent chain length on the interaction of the FtsQ TM with YidC TM3. Remarkably, 97FtsQCys40 integrated in the single cysteine YidC IMVs showed a BMOE cross-linking profile (Fig. 4B) almost identical to 108FtsQCys40 (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the FtsQ TM, although"

In addition, defects in Ca2+-handling processes, which shape membrane potential, influence gene transcription, and affect neuronal spiking patterns, have also been implicated in disease progression and cognitive decline. The mechanisms underlying the purported interplay that exists between neuroinflammation and Ca2+ homeostasis have yet to be defined. Herein, we describe a novel neuron-intrinsic pathway in which the expression of the type-1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor is regulated by the potent pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α. Exposure of primary murine neurons to tumor necrosis factor-α resulted in significant enhancement of Ca2+ signals downstream of muscarinic and purinergic stimulation. An increase in type-1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mRNA and protein steady-state levels following cytokine exposure positively correlated with this alteration in Ca2+ homeostasis. Modulation of Ca2+ responses arising from this receptor subtype and its downstream effectors may exact significant consequences on neuronal function and could underlie the compromise in neuronal activity observed in the setting of chronic neuroinflammation, such as that associated with Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.

Although the brain was once believed to be an immunoprivileged site, it is presently evident that immune-related activities, including inflammation, underlie normative and pathological brain function. The physiological events that govern the transition of inflammatory reactions associated with self-limited events to chronic activation of inflammatory cascades found in the setting of neurodegeneration are of considerable interest. Various neurological disorders, including Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and traumatic brain injury, display inflammation-related hallmarks, including cytokine and chemokine expression, the activation of central nervous system-residing macrophage-related cells (microglia), and in some cases, immune cell infiltration from peripheral sites via the brain microvasculature (reviewed in Ref. 1McGeer E.G. Klegeris A. McGeer P.L. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The roles these processes play in disease pathogenesis are, however, less clearly defined.

In the central nervous system, TNF-α is produced by brain-resident astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in response to numerous intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli (5Hanisch U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Radioactive binding assays have also indicated the presence of TNF receptors in several regions in the brain, including the cortex (6Kinouchi K. Brown G. Pasternak G. Donner D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 1532-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, its role within the central nervous system has been controversial. TNF-α has been shown in some studies to lead to positive outcomes, as in the case of remyelination (7Arnett H.A. Mason J. Marino M. Suzuki K. Matsushima G.K. Ting J.P. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1116-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar), and its ability to prevent neurons from apoptosis when exposed to amyloid-β, a possible causative agent of Alzheimer disease (8Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Alternatively, TNF-α induces neuronal apoptosis though an excitotoxic mechanism mediated through alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (9Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K.A. DiLoreto D. del Cerro C. del Cerro M. Epstein L.G. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and activates microglia, which may lead to the propagation of various neurological diseases (5Hanisch U.K. Glia. 2002; 40: 140-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). Few studies have detailed the effects of TNF-α on ionic signaling cascades within neuronal cells, and most of these have focused on the modulation of plasma membrane ion channels. For example, it was shown that TNF-α can cause the insertion of Ca2+-permeable alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors in the plasma membrane of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (10Ogoshi F. Yin H.Z. Kuppumbatti Y. Song B. Amindari S. Weiss J.H. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 193: 384-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and that TNF-α can increase N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor activity in mouse cortical neurons (11Jara J.H. Singh B.B. Floden A.M. Combs C.K. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1407-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These events both result in an increase in neuronal stress and possibly death. Our present study examined the effects of TNF-α on intracellular ion channels, specifically the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3R) and ryanodine (RyR) receptors. We posited that changes in channel expression and/or activity contribute to alterations in neuronal functioning observed during neuroinflammation. Modulation of responses arising from these receptors may have significant consequences for neuronal function and survival, ranging from membrane hyperpolarization (12Stutzmann G.E. Smith I. Caccamo A. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Parker I. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5180-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) to the alteration of global protein expression (13Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar). To this end, we report a novel neuro-intrinsic pathway through which TNF-α regulates type-1 IP3R expression at least partially through c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activation. Perturbation of Ca2+ signaling through activation of this IP3R subtype and its downstream effectors may significantly impact neuronal function and could ultimately compromise neuronal activity in the setting of chronic neuroinflammation. Primary Cell Cultures—Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were maintained as previously described (14Lu B. Federoff H.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 421-430Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Neuronal cultures were obtained from E14.5 cortical homogenates by microdissection and trypsin digestion. Neurons were then plated on polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml in B-27-supplemented Neurobasal Media (with 0.5 mm glutamine plus glutamic acid). One-half of the supplemented neurobasal media was changed every 4 days. Transwell co-cultures were established by culturing glia obtained from P0 C57BL/6 mice on plastic inserts (Corning). P0 cortices were microdissected, mechanically homogenized, and grown in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 12 days post-dissection (Invitrogen). Microglial cultures were obtained by gentle agitation of the T-75 flask, removal of the media, centrifugation, and plating at a density of 5 × 104 cells/insert in 5% fetal bovine serum. After 1 week of growth, supplemented minimal essential medium was removed from the inserts, and cocultures were established for 4 days before murine recombinant TNF-α addition (11 neuronal days in vitro). Ca2+ Imaging—Days 12, 13, and 14 in vitro (24, 48, and 72 h, respectively) neuronal cultures were removed from their culturing media and loaded with Fura2-AM (Teflabs, 1 μm) in HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (in mm): 5.5 glucose, 0.56 MgCl2, 4.7 KCl, 1 Na2HPO4, 10 HEPES, 1.2 CaCl2, pH 7.4. Ryanodine (100 μm) or Ru360 (10 μm) was loaded in conjunction with Fura2-AM for the RyR and mitochondrial blocking experiments, respectively. Coverslips were mounted in an imaging chamber and transferred to an inverted Nikon microscope with a 40× oil immersion objective lens (numerical aperture, 1.3). During experiments, HEPES-buffered solution, or an La3+-Ca2+ reduced solution (300 μm La3+ with 0.5 mm Ca2+), and agonists were perfused using a gravity-fed system (Warner Instruments), and excitation at 340 nm/380 nm was provided by a monochromator illumination system under the control of TILL Vision software. A SENSICAM-QE (Cooke) was used to detect 510 nm emission from 20 ms exposures at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. Reciprocal increases in fluorescence from 340 nm excitation and decreases in 380 nm excitation fluorescence corresponded to an increase in intracellular Ca2+. During agonist addition, the average deviation from baseline was calculated for each neuron, and these data were then pooled for each coverslip (n). A change of two standard deviations from baseline was considered a viable response. Mathematical and statistical analyses of the Ca2+ signals were performed using Origin 6.1 software. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—RNA was extracted from neuronal cultures by the TRIzol (Invitrogen) phenol-chloroform method. A 2-μg aliquot of RNA was converted to cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using an Assay-on-Demand primer probe set (Applied Biosystems) specific to the assayed gene and quantified by comparison to a serially diluted plasmid containing the gene of interest. Samples were analyzed on a Real Time 7300 PCR machine (Applied Biosystems) and 18 S rRNA and/or SERCA mRNA was utilized as a normalizing internal control for each sample. Western Blotting—For IP3R blots, primary neurons (6 × 105) were mechanically isolated from culture plates and homogenized through a 21.5-gauge needle in Solution A (5 mm NaN3, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). A 1,000 × g, 4 °C centrifugation step was then utilized to remove insoluble debris, and the remaining supernatants were transferred to 2-ml (Beckman) ultracentrifuge tubes. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a TLA-100.3 rotor (Beckman). Pellets were resuspended in appropriate volumes of Solution B (110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm 2-β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2). For cell surface receptor blots, primary neurons (3 × 105) were mechanically isolated with a rubber policeman in Modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and homogenized through a 21.5-gauge needle. All fractionation solutions were spiked with 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). Fractions were then quantified by an Amido Black assay (15Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Schnittler H.J. Cell Tissue Res. 1997; 288: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and 25 μg of each sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5% gel for the IP3Rs or a 12% gel for the surface receptors. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and incubated overnight with a type-1 IP3R antibody (Chemicon, 1:1,000), type-2 IP3R antibody, pan-SERCA antibody (AbCam and Sigma, 1:1,000), a pan-PMCA antibody (AbCam 1:1,000), or a TNF-R antibody (AbCam, 1:1,000). Affinity-purified anti-rabbit/mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG antibodies (Sigma) were then used in combination with Western Lightning reagent (PerkinElmer) for protein visualization. TNF-α Protein and Activity Assessment—Cell culture media was removed from TNF-α-treated neuronal cultures at 24, 48, and 72 h post-addition and assayed for the levels of murine TNF-α by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems) in accordance with manufacturers' directions. Media samples were further assayed for TNF-α biological activity similarly to a previously described method (16Sanchez J.F. Sniderhan L.F. Williamson A.L. Fan S. Chakraborty-Sett S. Maggirwar S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4649-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A reporter plasmid that contained multimerized NFκB binding elements and minimal promoter upstream of the recombinant firefly luciferase reporter gene was transiently transfected into BHK cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM. 6 h (T6) after transfection, the transfection mixture was removed, and neuronal culture media described above was added. At T18 the BHK monolayers were lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and examined for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega) and a Lumicount luminescent plate reader (Packard). Transfected, PBS-treated background luminescence was subtracted from the data set. Apoptosis Assay—Neuronal cultures were exposed to murine recombinant TNF-α for 24, 48, and 72 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Hoechst 33342 dye (Invitrogen) suspended in a Tris-buffered saline solution was added to the coverslips. Coverslips were then imaged on an IX70 microscope (Olympus) with 350 nm excitation from a mercury lamp (Chiu) and captured on a Progressive 3CCD (Sony) camera. Pyknotic and diffuse nuclei were counted offline using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) software. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was preformed using Microsoft Excel and Origin 6.1 software. A two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance was performed on resultant data sets as indicated. Statistical differences with p values of ≤0.05 were considered significant. Carbachol-mediated Ca2+ Signals Are Enhanced in Primary Neuronal Cultures Treated with TNF-α—To examine the impact of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, on endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived Ca2+ signals, we established neuronal cultures from C57BL/6 mouse embryos on glass coverslips. The cell composition of these cultures was determined through immunocytochemistry. NeuN, a neuronal nuclear protein, immunoreactivity overwhelmingly demonstrated the presence of primary neurons, whereas the absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein reactivity suggested minimal glial contamination (data not shown). Under low power magnification, it was evident that the primary neurons progressively elaborated processes during the course of the culturing period, a finding similar to that previously reported (17Detrait E.R. Bowers W.J. Halterman M.W. Giuliano R.E. Bennice L. Federoff H.J. Richfield E.K. Mol. Ther. 2002; 5: 723-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ levels in neurons were then examined by calcium imaging following 24-, 48-, and 72-h treatment with 100 ng/ml TNF-α. The concentration of 100 ng/ml (∼5 nm) murine recombinant TNF-α was chosen based on previously published literature (8Barger S.W. Horster D. Furukawa K. Goodman Y. Krieglstein J. Mattson M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9328-9332Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), as well as our own analysis of neuronal viability in the presence of the cytokine (supplemental Fig. S1). Perfusion of the neurons with the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh) was performed to determine if exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine leads to modulation of IP3-releasable Ca2+ pools, whereas perfusion with caffeine was used to determine if RyR release was altered with cytokine exposure. TNF-α treatment led to a significant up-regulation in peak height (2-fold, p < 0.05 by Student's t test) of CCh-mediated Ca2+ signals at 24- and 48-h post exposure with a return to control peak levels at 72 h after initial cytokine application (Fig. 1, A and B). This result was further analyzed by an analysis of variance for which the variable of TNF-α was significant (p = 0.006) in altering the peak CCh responses. The numbers of neurons per field that responded to 50 μm CCh were also analyzed, and no significant change was observed in the percentage of responding cells (Fig. 1C). In addition, basal [Ca2+]c levels of control and cytokine-treated cultures were analyzed by averaging the initial 20 s of the 340/380 ratio before CCh addition and were observed to not change with TNF-α addition (data not shown). A direct measurement of RyR release was also obtained by the addition of 25 mm caffeine. In contrast to the observed alterations in the CCh-induced Ca2+ signals, no change in RyR-mediated Ca2+ signals was observed after caffeine exposure either as a function of time or with TNF-α exposure (Fig. 1D). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the percentage of cells that responded to 25 mm caffeine (Fig. 1E), a concentration chosen based on previously published reports (12Stutzmann G.E. Smith I. Caccamo A. Oddo S. Laferla F.M. Parker I. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 5180-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Smith I.F. Hitt B. Green K.N. Oddo S. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Transwell co-cultures, containing both microglia and neurons, were also tested for the ability of TNF-α to enhance muscarinic signals (see supplemental Fig. S2). These cultures displayed a similar trend, suggesting at least in this paradigm that microglia were not playing a role in buffering the inflammatory signal. Collectively, these data indicate exogenously applied TNF-α modulates neuronal muscarinic Ca2+ signals but does not affect signals emanating from the RyR. TNF-α Potentiates Purinergic Receptor Ca2+ Signaling—The ability of TNF-α to increase neuronal Ca2+ signals was further analyzed to determine the ability of the cytokine to alter other Gq-coupled Ca2+ signals. Because neurons also express purinergic receptors (19Tokuyama Y. Hara M. Jones E.M. Fan Z. Bell G.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), ATP was utilized to further assess inositol-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Ca2+ release was isolated by reducing the Ca2+ concentration in the perfusion buffer (1.2 to 0.5 mm), and through the addition of 300 μm La3+, which has been shown to block Ca2+ entry (20Weiss G.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1974; 14: 343-354Crossref Google Scholar, 21Mattson M.P. Kater S.B. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 4034-4043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lansman J.B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 679-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Fifty micromolar ATP induced an increase in [Ca2+]c that was significantly larger with 24-h TNF-α pretreatment (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar to the muscarinic data, there was no alteration in the percentage of neurons that responded to the ATP perfusion (Fig. 2C). The alteration of both CCh and ATP signals, even in the presence of microglia, suggested that TNF-α can alter the IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling pathway, either at the level of Ca2+ release, clearance, or store-operated entry. Enhanced Signals Arise from Increased IP3R-mediated Ca2+ Release—The TNF-α-enhanced signals could arise from a multitude of factors besides a simple enhancement of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release. Increased Ca2+ entry, or Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, as well as decreased Ca2+ clearance, could all play a role. Therefore, we sought to determine if any of these latter mechanisms were responsible. 24-h TNF-α-treated and PBS-treated control coverslips were assayed by Ca2+ imaging in La3+-blocking solution to eliminate store-operated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3, A and B). The blocking solution successfully eliminated all Ca2+ influx as observed by the absence of a Ca2+ signal with the addition of 25 mm KCl (Fig. 3A). However, the enhanced CCh signals observed with cytokine treatment remained present (Fig. 3B). Removal of the La3+ block after agonist addition also allowed for the direct measurement of store-operated Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3, C and D). No difference in the peak signal obtained from Ca2+ entry (Fig. 3D) or in the kinetics (time constant (τ); Con = 14.7 ± 3.3 s, TNF-α = 16.1 ± 4.9 s) of Ca2+ influx with cytokine treatment was observed. In aggregate, these data demonstrated that an alteration in Ca2+ influx was not responsible for the enhanced signals following TNF-α treatment. Others have suggested previously that increased RyR-mediated Ca2+ release may account for enhanced muscarinic signals via the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (18Smith I.F. Hitt B. Green K.N. Oddo S. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 1711-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Even though enhanced RyR signals were not observed with cytokine addition, changes in functional coupling between the two ER receptors could underlie the TNF-α effect. To disrupt any coupling between the IP3R and RyR, the RyR was inhibited by a 30-min preincubation with 100 μm ryanodine, and again CCh-induced Ca2+ signals were examined following TNF-α treatment. Ryanodine treatment blocked caffeine-induced Ca2+ release completely (Fig. 3E), and, as previously reported, a reduction in fluorescence due to caffeine binding to the Fura-2 dye was observed (23Muschol M. Dasgupta B.R. Salzberg B.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, blocking the RyR had no effect on the TNF-α-enhanced muscarinic signals (Fig. 3F). Because a reduction in Ca2+ clearance could also increase [Ca2+]c after exposure to an agonist, Ca2+ clearance parameters were examined following TNF-α treatment. To examine this process, the decay of Ca2+ signals recorded in the caffeine-imaging experiments was fit to a single exponential (Fig. 4A). This decay parameter accounts for Ca2+ clearance at both the plasma membrane (PMCA) and endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) as well as any Ca2+ uptake by cellular organelles, including mitochondria. No significant alteration in the clearance of Ca2+ from neuronal soma was observed at any of the time points assayed (Fig. 4B). In addition, experiments were also performed in the presence of the selective mitochondrial calcium uniporter inhibitor, Ru360 (24Ying W.L. Emerson J. Clarke M.J. Sanadi D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4949-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The average values for the CCh responses in the presence of this inhibitor, which has been previously shown in the literature and within our laboratory to effectively block mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (25Bruce J.I. Giovannucci D.R. Blinder G. Shuttleworth T.J. Yule D.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12909-12917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), did not deviate from the previously observed trend with cytokine addition (peak Con = 0.18 ± 0.5 ratio units, TNF-α = 0.32 ± 0.1 ratio unit). Furthermore, the steady-state expression levels of both PMCA and SERCA were analyzed by Western blotting with respective pan antibodies and determined to be unchanged (Fig. 4C), demonstrating that altered clearance was not responsible for the enhanced muscarinic and purinergic signals. IP3 R-mediated Ca2+ release could also be enhanced by increasing the Ca2+ loading of the ER after cytokine exposure. To determine the steady-state Ca2+ levels, we utilized a reversible SERCA pump inhibitor, cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), in the presence of La3+ block and measured the peak height and peak area of the response (26Goeger D.E. Riley R.T. Dorner J.W. Cole R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). CPA addition led to a transient increase in Ca2+ that was observed to be equal in both TNF-α and control treated neurons (Fig. 4D). The total Ca2+ released, as indicated by the area of the response, was also of equal magnitude for each treatment group. Cumulatively, these experiments indicated that the TNF-α effect on muscarinic signaling was independent of Ca2+ influx, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, Ca2+ clearance, and ER Ca2+ loading, and likely pointed to molecular alterations in the IP3-mediated Ca2+ release pathway. TNF-α Mediated Modulation of Type-1 IP3R mRNA and Protein Levels—Because TNF receptor signaling is linked to two major transcriptional pathways, JNK/activator protein-1 and NFκB (27Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), the mechanism of TNF-α enhancement of CCh signals could involve transcriptional regulation and/or stabilization of the one or more IP3R gene transcripts. To elucidate possible increases in steady-state mRNA, total RNA was extracted from neuronal cultures exposed to recombinant TNF-α and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed. The expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA, whose expression is known to be regulated by TNF-α (28Sica A. Wang J.M. Colotta F. Dejana E. Mantovani A. Oppenheim J.J. Larsen C.G. Zachariae C.O. Matsushima K. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3034-3038PubMed Google Scholar), served as a positive control, and increased by 6 h following TNF-α application and remained at elevated levels through 12 h (Fig. 5A). This increase in MCP-1 message level was significant (p < 0.05) versus RNA derived from non-treated control cultures. TaqMan primer/probe sets specific to each of the three types of IP3R were used to monitor transcript levels of the receptors in untreated neurons or neurons exposed to TNF-α for 0, 6, 12, and 18 h. The level of transcript for the predominant neuronal type of the IP3R, the type-1 IP3R, was increased significantly at 12 h (p = 0.05, Fig. 5C). The type-2 IP3R followed a similar trend but did not reach significance (p = 0.12, Fig. 5E), whereas the transcript level for the type-3 IP3R remained unchanged over time with TNF-α exposure (Fig. 5G). SERCA transcript was used as an internal control for input RNA and for continuity with subsequent Western blot experiments, because its expression did not change in response to TNF-α treatment (see Fig. 4C). Western blotting was performed to determine whether enhanced levels of type-1 IP3R transcript would lead to higher steady-state levels of protein. Consistent with the qRT-PCR analyses, the levels of the type-1 IP3R at 24 and 48 h post-TNF-α exposure were enhanced (Fig. 5B) and the ratio of receptor to SERCA protein was significantly elevated (Fig. 5D, 24 h: p = 0.03 and 48 h: p = 0.01) following TNF-α exposure. SERCA protein expression was used as a loading control, because its expression was abundant in these ER-enriched preparations and its large molecular weight allowed it to be observed on the IP3R blot (Fig. 5, B and F). Western blotting was also undertaken for the type-2 IP3R (Fig. 5, F and H), which, similar to the qRT-PCR data, showed no significant change in protein after cytokine addition. Hence, the elevation in type-1 IP3R mRNA at 12 h and subsequent protein elevation at 24 and 48 h correlated with the observed increase in Ca2+ signals at the 24- and 48-h time points. Resolution of IP3R Protein Levels and Ca2+ Signaling—A time course of TNF-α influence on IP3R protein expression and CCh-induced Ca2+ signal alterations was observed with elevations at 24 and 48 h and a return to baseline at the 72-h time point. In an effort to determine the reason for signal termination, TNF-α peptide concentration and activity was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an in vitro activity assay in which a reporter plasmid construct was transiently transfected into"
https://openalex.org/W1969860384,"Human neural stem cells (hNSC) represent an essential source of renewable brain cells for both experimental studies and cell replacement therapies. Their relatively slow rate of proliferation and physiological senescence in culture make their use cumbersome under some experimental and pre-clinical settings. The immortalization of hNSC with the v-myc gene (v-IhNSC) has been shown to generate stem cells endowed with enhanced proliferative capacity, which greatly facilitates the study of hNSCs, both in vitro and in vivo. Despite the excellent safety properties displayed by v-IhNSCs--which do not transform in vitro and are not tumorigenic in vivo--the v-myc gene contains several mutations and recombination elements, whose role(s) and effects remains to be elucidated, yielding unresolved safety concerns. To address this issue, we used a c-myc T58A retroviral vector to establish an immortal cell line (T-IhNSC) from the same hNSCs used to generate the original v-IhNSCs and compared their characteristics with the latter, with hNSC and with hNSC immortalized using c-myc wt (c-IhNSC). T-IhNSCs displayed an enhanced self-renewal ability, with their proliferative capacity and clonogenic potential being remarkably comparable to those of v-IhNSC and higher than wild type hNSCs and c-IhNSCs. Upon growth factors removal, T-IhNSC promptly gave rise to well-differentiated neurons, astrocytes and most importantly, to a heretofore undocumented high percentage of human oligodendrocytes (up to 23%). Persistent growth-factor dependence, steady functional properties, lack of ability to generate colonies in soft-agar colony-forming assay and to establish tumors upon orthotopic transplantation, point to the fact that immortalization by c-myc T58A does not bring about tumorigenicity in hNSCs. Hence, this work describes a novel and continuous cell line of immortalized human multipotent neural stem cells, in which the immortalizing agent is represented by a single gene which, in turn, carries a single and well characterized mutation. From a different perspective, these data report on a safe approach to increase human neural stem cells propagation in culture, without altering their basic properties. These T-IhNSC line provides a versatile model for the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in human neural stem cells expansion and for development of high throughput assays for both basic and translational research on human neural cell development. The improved proclivity of T-IhNSC to generate human oligodendrocytes propose T-IhNSC as a feasible candidate for the design of experimental and, perhaps, therapeutic approaches in demyelinating diseases."

Recent studies revealed the existence of a novel anti-recombination enzyme, MutS2. However, the mechanism by which MutS2 inhibits homologous recombination has been unknown. Previously, we found that Thermus thermophilus MutS2 (ttMutS2) harbors an endonuclease activity and that this activity is confined to the C-terminal domain, whose amino acid sequence is widely conserved in a variety of proteins with unknown function from almost all organisms ranging from bacteria to man. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of the ttMutS2 endonuclease domain at 1.7-Å resolution, which resembles the structure of the DNase I-like catalytic domain of Escherichia coli RNase E, a sequence-nonspecific endonuclease. The N-terminal domain of ttMutS2, however, recognized branched DNA structures, including the Holliday junction and D-loop structure, a primary intermediate in homologous recombination. The full-length of ttMutS2 digested the branched DNA structures at the junction. These results indicate that ttMutS2 suppresses homologous recombination through a novel mechanism involving resolution of early intermediates.

Homologous recombination is required for a variety of DNA transactions such as DNA repair, the rescue of stalled replication forks, and the creation of genetic diversity (1Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Saberi A. Taniguchi Y. Takeda S. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 2Weaver D.T.

The reaction begins with the introduction of a double strand break in the homologous region of the donor strand (5Ishino Y. Nishino T. Morikawa K. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 324-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 6West S.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 435-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 7Sung P. Klein H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 739-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The ends of the strand are resected by exonucleases to generate termini with 3′-overhangs. Then, RecA protein (Rad51 in eukaryotes) recognizes the single-stranded region of the DNA and catalyzes the invasion into the target double-stranded DNA to generate the D-loop structure. The sequential DNA synthesis and ligation yield a general intermediate called the Holliday junction. Several junction-specific endonucleases resolve the junction, and DNA ligase reseals the nicks to complete the process of homologous recombination. This homologous recombination process is utilized not only for the recovery but also for the alteration of genetic information.To avoid unfavorable alteration of genetic information, organisms are equipped with a series of enzymes that not only promote but also suppress homologous recombination (4Thomas C.M. Nielsen K.M. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that bacterial and plant MutS2 proteins are candidate anti-recombination enzymes (8Pinto A.V. Mathieu A. Marsin S. Veaute X. Ielpi L. Labigne A. Radicella J.P. Mol.

MutS2 is a paralogue of Escherichia coli MutS, which recognizes a mismatched base pair and induces the mismatch repair (MMR) 2The abbreviations used are: MMRmismatch repairssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAttMutS2T. thermophilus MutS2Smrsmall MutS-relatedttSmrT. thermophilus Smr domainttMutS1T. thermophilus MutS1MMCmitomycin-CBSAbovine serum albuminr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationN4BP2NEDD4-binding protein 2. 2The abbreviations used are: MMRmismatch repairssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNAttMutS2T. thermophilus MutS2Smrsmall MutS-relatedttSmrT. thermophilus Smr domainttMutS1T. thermophilus MutS1MMCmitomycin-CBSAbovine serum albuminr.m.s.d.root mean square deviationN4BP2NEDD4-binding protein 2. pathway (Fig. 1). Proteins homologous to E. coli MutS are widely distributed and classified into two subfamilies, MutSI and MutSII, on the basis of amino acid sequence comparison (10Eisen J.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4291-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The former is responsible for MMR and includes bacterial MutS and eukaryotic MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 (11Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jiricny J. Mutat. Res. 1998; 409: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The latter, MutSII, is expected to not be involved in MMR but in recombinational events, and includes bacterial MutS2 and eukaryotic MSH4 and MSH5. It had been reported that eukaryotic MSH4 and MSH5 promote homologous recombination (13Ross-Macdonald P. Roeder G.S. Cell. 1994; 79: 1069-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 14Hollingsworth N.M. Ponte L. Halsey C.

Cell. 2004; 15: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In contrast, the disruption of Helicobacter pylori mutS2 increases the frequency of homologous recombination, indicating that H. pylori MutS2 suppresses homologous recombination (8Pinto A.V. Mathieu A. Marsin S. Veaute X. Ielpi L. Labigne A. Radicella J.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 113-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Kang J. Huang S. Blaser M.J. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3528-3537Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that purified H. pylori MutS2 binds to a DNA structure mimicking the Holliday junction and interferes with the strand-exchange reaction mediated by RecA in vitro (8Pinto A.V. Mathieu A. Marsin S. Veaute X. Ielpi L. Labigne A. Radicella J.P. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 113-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which MutS2 inhibits the strand-exchange reaction has been unknown.Previously, we found that Thermus thermophilus MutS2 (ttMutS2) possesses nicking endonuclease activity (16Fukui K. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. 2004; 135: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and this activity is confined to the C-terminal domain, which does not exist in the other MutS homologues (17Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 860-870Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This C-terminal domain is called the small MutS-related (Smr) domain. The amino acid sequence homologous to this domain is widely conserved in a variety of proteins with unknown function from almost all organisms, including Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and E. coli (18Moreira D. Philippe H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 298-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Malik H.S. Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 414-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It was also confirmed that the endonuclease activity of the T. thermophilus Smr domain (ttSmr) is sequence-nonspecific (20Fukui K. Takahata Y. Nakagawa N. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: e100Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how the endonuclease activity is involved in the suppression of homologous recombination. The role of the N-terminal domain of ttMutS2 has also to be established.In this study, we determined the crystal structure of ttSmr663 (amino acid residues 663–774 of ttMutS2) at 1.7-Å resolution, which revealed the structural similarity between ttSmr and the DNase I-like catalytic domain of E. coli RNase E. The structural relevance of ttSmr to nonspecific endonucleases supports our previous finding of the sequence-nonspecific endonuclease activity of ttSmr. Furthermore, it has been clarified that the N-terminal domain of ttMutS2 recognizes branched DNA structures, including the D-loop structure, which is an early intermediate in homologous recombination. ttMutS2 incised the branched DNA structures at the junctions. These results strongly suggest the novel mechanism of MutS2 inhibiting homologous recombination through endonucleolytic resolution of the primary intermediates. Such a mechanism had previously been unknown.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Preparations—E. coli strains DH5α, BL21(DE3), and Rosetta-gami(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) were cultured in YT broth (0.8% (w/v) tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl) (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Plasmids pET-11a/ttmutS2, pET-11a/N60-ttmutS2, and pET-15b/ttSmr621, derived from pET-11a and pET-15b (Novagen), contain the complete, 3′-terminal region-deleted, and 5′-terminal region-deleted ttmutS2 genes, respectively, under control of a T7 promoter (17Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 860-870Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ttMutS2, N60-ttMutS2, ttSmr621, and T. thermophilus MutS1 (ttMutS1) were overexpressed and purified as described previously (17Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 860-870Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 22Takamatsu S. Kato R. Kuramitsu S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 640-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment expressing the ttSmr663 domain was generated by PCR using the T. thermophilus HB8 genomic DNA as a template. The following primer pairs were used for amplification of the fragment: 5′-ATATCATATGCGGGAGGTGAAGGAGGTG-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTTTATTATCACCAAGGCCGAAGCGCCACCAC-3′. The forward and reverse primers contained NdeI and BglII restriction sites, respectively (underlined). The amplified ttSmr663 fragment was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-11a (Novagen). The E. coli smr (ydaL) gene was also amplified by PCR using the E. coli genomic DNA as a template. The amplified gene fragment was ligated into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-15b (Novagen) generating pET-15b/E. coli smr plasmid. Sequence analyses revealed that the constructions were error-free.E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET-11a/ttsmr663 and then grown at 37 °C in 1.5 liters of YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the density of cultures reached 4 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 4 h after induction and then harvested by centrifugation. The cells were then lysed by sonication in buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 50 mm NaCl) and then heated to 70 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was loaded onto a SuperQ column (40 ml, TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) pre-equilibrated with buffer I. The flow-through fraction was collected and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (40 ml, TOSOH) equilibrated with buffer I. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer I and then eluted with a 300-ml gradient of 0.05–1 m NaCl in buffer I. The fractions containing ttSmr were detected by SDS-PAGE and concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (Vivascience, Hanover, Germany). The concentrated solution was applied to a Superdex 200 HR column (24 ml, GE Healthcare Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) pre-equilibrated with buffer I using an ÄKTA Explorer (GE Healthcare Biosciences). Because the lack of tryptophan and tyrosine residues in ttSmr663 prevented us from determining the concentration using the absorbance intensity at 280 nm (23Kuramitsu S. Hiromi K. Hayashi H. Morino Y. Kagamiyama H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5469-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the concentration of the protein solution was determined by means of the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The protein was stored at 4 °C. Peptide mass fingerprinting (24Kumarathasan P. Mohottalage S. Goegan P. Vincent R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 346: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) confirmed that the purified protein was ttSmr663. E. coli Smr was overexpressed by the same procedure as that for ttSmr663 using the pET-15b/E. coli smr plasmid. The harvested cells were lysed by sonication in buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mm NaCl). After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a HiTrap Chelating HP5 column (5 ml) pre-equilibrated with buffer II containing 1 mm NiCl2 using ÄKTA Explorer. The column was washed with buffer II containing 50 mm imidazole and then eluted with a 60-ml gradient of 0.05–0.5 m imidazole in buffer II. The fraction containing E. coli Smr was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200-pg column (120 ml) pre-equilibrated with the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl. The eluted E. coli Smr solution was concentrated to 2.4 mg/ml using a Vivaspin concentrator. N-terminal amino acid sequencing analysis confirmed that the purified protein was E. coli Smr, and the protein was stored at 4 °C.X-ray Crystallographic Analysis of ttSmr663—The crystallization conditions for ttSmr663 were surveyed by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing 1 μl of a protein solution with an equal volume of a reservoir solution using crystal screen kits (Crystal Screen, Crystal Screen2 and Index, Hampton Research) at 20 °C. The protein concentration used was 10 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mm NaCl. Crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were obtained under the conditions of 100 mm citric acid and 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 at 20 °C. The crystal in the mother liquor was cryo-cooled in a nitrogen-gas stream. Data were collected at the wavelength of 1.0 Å at BL26B2 at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). Diffraction images were processed with the HKL2000 program (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Using the solution structure of the human Smr domain (2d9i) as a search model, the structure of ttSmr663 was solved by molecular replacement. The program MOLREP was used for the rotation and translation searches (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The model was refined using COOT (27Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22815) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 57: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). The final model was refined to an R-factor of 18.7% and an R-free value of 22.2% and examined by PROCHECK (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The structure coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession number 2ZQE.Gene Disruption and in Vivo Experiments—The 5′- and 3′-terminal 300-bp regions of ttmutS2 were amplified by PCR from the pT7Blue/ttmutS2 plasmid. A thermostable kanamycin resistance gene, HTK, was also amplified by PCR from pUC18/HTK plasmid DNA (30Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The three DNA fragments were fused by the fusion PCR method (31Kitazono A.A. Tobe B.T. Kalton H. Diamant N. Kron S.J. Yeast. 2002; 19: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to obtain the pT7Blue/ttmutS2::HTK plasmid for ttmutS2 gene disruption. pT7Blue/ndx8::Hyg (hygromycin resistance gene) was a generous gift from Drs. Yoshinori Koyama and Takushi Ooga and was used for transformation experiments. The culture condition for T. thermophilus HB8 was described previously (30Hoseki J. Yano T. Koyama Y. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).The rate of homologous recombination between the endogenous ndx8 gene and the exogenous DNA cassette, including the thermostable hygromycin resistance gene flanked by 300-bp of the 5′ and 3′ regions of ndx8, was measured. An overnight culture was diluted 1:60 with TT medium and then shaken at 70 °C for 2 h (∼1 × 108 cells/ml). This culture (400 μl) was mixed with 50 μl of a DNA solution. The mixture was shaken at 70 °C for 2 h and then spread on plates containing 20 μg/ml hygromycin. The plates were incubated at 70 °C for 30 h.E. coli Rosetta-gami (DE3) strain was transformed with pET-11a, pET-11a/ttmutS2, or pET-11a/N60-ttmutS2 and then plated onto YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Colonies were cultured in 3 ml of YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. When the density of cultures reached 4 × 108 cells/ml, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 1 mm. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 1 h after induction and diluted to 1:105 with YT medium. The cells were irradiated with 254 nm UV light for various periods using UV transilluminator (Vilber Lourmat, Torey, France) and then spread on plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h, and then the numbers of the colonies were counted.DNA Substrates—DNA substrates were made by annealing various combinations of oligonucleotides. Annealing reactions were carried out by incubating stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate DNA fragments for 2 h at 65 in 50 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and fragments were allowed to cool slowly. The synthesized 60-mer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCXAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′ (Bex, Tokyo, Japan), was radiolabeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan). The 5′-32P-labeled ssDNA was annealed to the complementary ssDNA (5′-GGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTYGCAATCCATTGGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′) to obtain dsDNA containing a matched or mismatched base pair (X = T for perfectly matched homoduplex and G-T mismatched heteroduplex; Y = A for homoduplex; and Y = G for G-T mismatched heteroduplex). To obtain the mobile Holliday junction containing a homologous sequence, the synthesized ssDNA, 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′, was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and then annealed with three synthesized ssDNAs, 5′-TGGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGTCTATGACGTCAAGCT-3′, 5′-GAGCTTGACGTCATAGACAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCGTCTTGTCAATATCGGC-3′, and 5′-GCCGATATTGACAAGACGGCAAAGATGTCCTAGCAATCCATTGGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′. To obtain the immobile Holliday junction lacking the homologous core, 5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGGGATCCGTCCTAGCAAGCCGCTGCTACCGGAAGCTTCTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′, was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and then annealed with three synthesized ssDNAs, 5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGAAGCTTCCGGTAGCAGCGAGAGCGGTGGTTGAATTCCTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′, 5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGGAATTCAACCACCGCTCTTCTCAACTGCAGTCTAGACTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′, and 5′-CGCAAGCGACAGGAACCTCGAGTCTAGACTGCAGTTGAGAGCTTGCTAGGACGGATCCCTCGAGGTTCCTGTCGCTTGCG-3′. To obtain the D-loop structure, the synthesized ssDNA, 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′, was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and then annealed with two synthesized ssDNAs, 5′-GGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGATGTTAGCCATGACCTGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′ and 5′-TAAGACTGGACTCAGCTAGGTCATGGCTAACAT-3′. To obtain the loop structure, the synthesized ssDNA, 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′ was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and then annealed with a synthesized ssDNA, 5′-GGGTGAACCTGCAGGTGATGTTAGCCATGACCTGTGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′. To obtain the fork structure, the synthesized ssDNA, 5′-CCGCTACCAGTGATCACCAATGGATTGCTAGGACATCTTTGCCCACCTGCAGGTTCACCC-3′, was labeled at the 5′-end with 32P, and then annealed with two synthesized ssDNAs, 5′-TGATCACTGGTAGCGG-3′ and 5′-TAAGACTGGACTCAGCTAGGTCATGGCTAACAT-3′.Gel Shift Assay—The assay was performed as described previously (17Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 860-870Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled homoduplex and Holliday junction were incubated with 0–1000 nm ttMutS2 or N60-ttMutS2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0 or 5 mm ADP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA, Takara), pH 7.5, for 30 min at 37 °C.Nuclease Assay Using Oligonucleotides—The same substrate as that used in the gel shift assay was incubated with various concentrations of freshly prepared ttMutS2 in a buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5. Reactions were performed at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of sample buffer (5 mm EDTA, 80% deionized formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). The incubation time is indicated in the legends to the figures. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto 25% polyacrylamide gels or 11% polyacrylamide sequencing gels (8 m urea and 1× TBE buffer) (89 mm Tris-borate and 2 mm EDTA), and then electrophoresed with 1× TBE buffer.Competition Experiment—The same substrates as that used in the gel shift assay were also used here. The 32P-labeled homoduplex was mixed with 200 nm freshly prepared ttMutS2, N60-ttMutS2, or 500 nm ttSmr in a buffer comprising 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0 or 5 mm ADP and 0.1 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.5, in the presence of various concentrations of the non-labeled homoduplex, Holliday junction, or D-loop structure (concentrations of competitors are indicated in the legends to figures). The mixtures were immediately loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed with 1× TBE buffer. The gels were analyzed as described above. The relative percentages of the shifted signals compared with all signals were plotted against the concentrations of the competitor. The data were fitted to Equation 1 using software Igor Pro 4.03 (WaveMetrics). Equation 1 was generated by assuming competitive inhibition, as below.The dissociation constants of the enzyme for the substrate and competitor are given in Equations 1 and 2. Kd=[E][S]/[ES](Eq. 1) Ki[E][I]/[EI](Eq. 2) The total enzyme concentration, [E]0, and the free enzyme concentration, [E], are related by Equation 3. [E]=[E]0-[ES]-[EI](Eq. 3) Also, the total competitor concentration, [I]0, and the free competitor concentration, [I], are related by Equation 4.[I]=[I]0-[EI](Eq. 4) The total substrate concentration, [S]0, was supposed to nearly equal to that of the free substrate, [S].From these equations, Equation 5 was obtained. [ES]/[S]0=[[E]0-[I]0-Ki[S]0/Kd-Ki+{(Ki[S]0/Kd+Ki-[E]0+[I]0)2+4(1-Kd/[S]0)(Ki[E]0[S]0/Kd)}1/2]/2[S]0(I-Kd/[S]0)(Eq. 5) DNase I Footprinting—DNase I footprinting was carried out by modifying the procedure originally described by Galas and Schmitz (32Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled homoduplex, mobile Holliday junction, or D-loop structure was incubated with various concentrations of N60-ttMutS2 or ttMutS1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ADP, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C for 1 h (concentrations of enzymes are indicated in legends to figures). Then, 1 μl of 0.35 unit/μl DNase I (Takara) was added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of a phenol-chloroform solution and the solutions were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were mixed with the sample buffer (5 mm EDTA, 80% deionized formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and then heat-treated at 95 °C for 5 min. The length of the DNA product was subsequently determined by analysis on an 11% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 8 m urea and 1× TBE buffer.Nuclease Assay Using Plasmid DNA—The assay was performed as described previously (17Fukui K. Kosaka H. Kuramitsu S. Masui R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 860-870Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 5 ng/μl pUC19 (Takara) or pUC(AT) (New England Biolabs) plasmid DNA was incubated with or without freshly prepared ttMutS2 or bovine DNase I (Takara) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C. The concentrations of the enzymes and incubation times are indicated in the legends to the figures.RESULTSCrystal Structure of the ttMutS2 Endonuclease Domain—We prepared ttSmr663 for x-ray crystallographic analysis. The ttSmr663 was designed on the basis of the definition of the Smr domain (PF01713) in Pfam (33Finn R.D. Mistry J. Schuster-Böckler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Sonnhammer E.L. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar) and results obtained from limited proteolysis of full-length ttMutS2 and ttSmr621 (amino acid residues 621–774 of ttMutS2) (data not shown). It was confirmed that ttSmr663 retained the endonuclease activity that converts the covalently closed circular form of plasmid DNA into the open circular form (data not shown).The crystal structure of ttSmr663 was determined at 1.7-Å resolution by means of molecular replacement methodology using the solution structure of the human Smr domain (2d9i) as a search model. The statistics for the data collection and model refinement are summarized in Table 1. The overall structure of the ttSmr663 comprised an α/β-sandwich structure with a βαβαββ fold consisting a four-stranded β-sheet stacked against two α-helices (Fig. 2, A and B). The structures of ttSmr663 and the human Smr domain are highly homologous to each other (Z-score = 10.65, root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) = 2.2 Å, sequence identity = 27%) (Fig. 2C), indicating that the Smr domains from all kingdoms have the same folds. Interestingly, a structural homology search using the MATRAS program (34Kawabata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3367-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) revealed that the overall structure of ttSmr663 significantly resembles that of the DNase I-like catalytic domain of E. coli RNase E (2bx2) (Z-score = 6.63, r.m.s.d. = 2.9, sequence identity = 11%) (Fig. 2D), although there is no detectable sequence similarity between them. It has been pointed out that the structure of the RNase E catalytic domain resembles that of the N- and C-terminal domains of bovine DNase I, and the catalytic sites of these enzymes roughly coincide (35Callaghan A.J. Marcaida M.J. Stead J.A. McDowall K.J. Scott W.G. Luisi B.F. Nature. 2004; 437: 1187-1191Crossref Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In good agreement with this, the Dali program (36Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar) revealed the structural similarities between ttSmr663 and the N-terminal domain of bovine DNase I (2dnj) (Z-score = 3.4, r.m.s.d. = 3.0 Å, sequence identity = 10%) (Fig. 2D).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsFree (native)Data collection Space groupp21212 Cell dimensions, a, b, c (Å)48.8, 54.2, 30.2 Resolution (Å)50-1.7 (1.76-1.7) Rmerge0.047 (0.137)aValues in parentheses are for the outermost shell I/σI36.4 (13.2) Completeness99.8 (100) Redundancy6.3 (5.2) Measured reflections58,499Refinement Resolution (Å)7.9-1.7 No. reflections9284 Rwork/Rfree0.188/0.226 No. atoms Protein744 Water104 B-factors Protein8.2 Water12.7 r.m.s.d.

Might adenylyl cyclase VI have beneficial effects unrelated to increased β-adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling? We previously reported that adenylyl cyclase VI reduces cardiac phospholamban expression. Our focus in the current studies is how adenylyl cyclase VI influences phospholamban phosphorylation. In cultured cardiac myocytes, increased expression of adenylyl cyclase VI activates Akt by phosphorylation at serine 473 and threonine 308 and is associated with increased nuclear phospho-Akt. Activated Akt phosphorylates phospholamban, a process that does not require β-adrenergic receptor stimulation or protein kinase A activation. These previously unrecognized signaling events would be predicted to promote calcium handling and increase contractile function of the intact heart independently of β-adrenergic receptor activation. We speculate that phospholamban phosphorylation, through activation of Akt, may be an important mechanism by which adenylyl cyclase VI increases the function of the failing heart.

AC is the effector molecule in the β-adrenergic receptor (βAR)-Gs-AC signaling pathway and for many other G-protein-coupled receptors in cardiac myocytes and other cells (1Post S.R. Hilal-Dandan R.

Cardiac-directed expression of ACVI in murine cardiomyopathy increases cardiac function, attenuates myocardial hypertrophy, and increases survival (4Roth D.M. Gao M.H. Lai N.C. Drumm J. Dalton N.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether increased ACVI expression has effects not directly linked with βAR stimulation and protein kinase A (PKA) activation, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for the unanticipated favorable effects of increased cardiac ACVI expression in heart failure. We previously reported that ACVI reduces cardiac phospholamban (PLB) expression through increased expression of activating transcription factor-3, which suppresses PLB promoter activity (8Gao M.H. Tang T. Guo T. Sun S.Q. Feramisco J.R. Hammond H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38797-38802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We now focus on how ACVI influences PLB phosphorylation. We test the hypothesis that ACVI increases PLB phosphorylation independently of βAR stimulation and PKA activation. This would result in increased cardiac function but would circumvent deleterious effects of sustained PKA activation (9Antos C.L. Frey N. Marx S.O. Reiken S. Gaburjakova M. Richardson J.A. Marks A.R.

The Akt consensus peptide, RPRAATF, was purchase from Calbiochem. Phospholamban peptide (RSAIRRAST) was synthesized by Abgent (San Diego, CA). Cardiac Myocyte Culture and Gene Transfer—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated as previously described (10Gao M.H. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One day after plating, an E1-deleted recombinant adenovirus encoding murine ACVI (with an AU1 tag, a 6-amino acid epitope: DTYRYI) was added to the culture media (600 viral particle/cell). An adenovirus encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was used as a control vector. Twenty-four hours after adenovirus was added, cultured cells were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol or 10 μm NKH477, a water-soluble forskolin analog that directly stimulates AC. Kinase inhibitors were added 2 h after adenovirus infection in specific experiments (see below). Cloning of GST-PLB and Site-directed Mutagenesis—A full-length rat PLB cDNA was cloned from neonatal rat cardiac myocytes using reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. The primer for reverse transcription was a random hexamer obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The primers for PCR included: PLBs, 5′-GGAATTCATGGAAAAAGTCCAATACCTTAC and PLBas, 5′-GGAATTCCAGAAGCATCACAATGATG. The PLB cDNA was subcloned into pGEX1λT vector (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) at an EcoRI site. After the sequence was confirmed by PCR, the GST-PLB plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α strain). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed. The primers used for generating variants of GST-PLB included 5′-TCG GCT ATC AGG GCA GCC TCG ACT ATT for mutating amino acid Arg to Ala at -2 position (Mut-2), 5′-CGC TCG GCT ATC GCG AGA GCC TCG ACT for mutating Arg to Ala at -3 position (Mut-3), 5′ CTT ACT CGC TCG CGT ATC AGG AGA GCC for mutating Ala to Arg at -5 position (Mut-5, Akt consensus), and 5′-CAA TAC CTT ACT GCC TCG GCT ATC AGG for mutating Arg to Ala at -7 position (Mut-7). Generation of GST-PLB Fusion Protein—The recombinant GST-PLB fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria after induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h. To purify the GST-PLB protein, bacteria were collected in PBS, sonicated, and lysed with Triton X-100 (final concentration, 1%) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 30 min), the GST-PLB proteins were purified by incubating the supernatant with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, which was followed by washing six times with PBS. GST-PLB proteins were confirmed (SDS-PAGE), and the amount of fusion proteins was determined using bovine serum albumin standard on the same SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST-PLB by Akt—Different amounts of GST-PLB beads (50% in PBS) were incubated with recombinant Akt1 protein (100 ng) in kinase buffer (8 mm MOPS (pH 7.2); 0.2 mm EDTA; 1.0 mm EGTA; 15 mm MgCl2; 100 μm ATP; 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate; 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate; 0.2 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× SDS-Sample Buffer, and the sample was separated (SDS-PAGE). The phospho-Ser-16 on GST-PLB protein was detected using anti-phospho-PLB (S16) antibody (1:3000). Phosphorylation of PLB Peptide by Akt—The Akt kinase assay reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 10 mm MOPS/NaOH, pH 7.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 15 MgCl2, 100 μm cold ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and various concentrations of substrate. The reaction was carried out for 10 min at 30 °C after adding 100 ng of recombinant Akt and stopped by adding 12.5 μl of termination buffer (7.5 m guanidine hydrochloride). This amount of recombinant Akt and the reaction time was tittered to be in the lineage range. Ten microliters of reaction mix was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filter and washed extensively with 0.75% phosphoric acid. Radioactive 32P incorporation was counted using a scintillation counter. The Km and Vmax were determined by performing a nonlinear least-square best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA). PKA and CaMKII Activities—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes infected with Ad.ACVI or Ad.EGFP or uninfected were stimulated with isoproterenol (10 μm) and NKH477 (10 μm) for 10 min. Cardiac myocytes then were homogenized in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm EGTA; 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol; 50 mm β-glycerophosphate; 10 mm NaF; 1 mm Na3VO4) in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with PKA biotinylated peptide substrate provided in SigmaTECT® cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase (PKA) Assay System or with CaMKII-biotinylated peptide substrate provided in SigmaTECT Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase Assay System in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled and biotinylated substrate was recovered with a streptavidin matrix, and the specific activity of PKA or CaMKII in each sample was determined by measuring the amount of radioactive substrate. Akt Activity—The Akt kinase assay kit was used for detection of Akt activity in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocyte extracts were prepared by lysing in Cell Lysis Buffer (provided in kit) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g (10 min, 4 °C). Akt protein then was specifically precipitated using an anti-Akt antibody. The precipitate then was incubated with recombinant glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) α/β fusion protein in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer to allow Akt to phosphorylate GSK-3α/β at Ser-21/9 sites. Phosphorylated GSK-3 was detected by immunoblotting using an anti phospho-GSK-3α/β antibody (1:1,000). Rap1 activity was used to determine the effects of ACVI on Epac signaling pathways. Rap1 activity was detected using the EZ-Detect Rap1 activation kit and protocol from the manufactory (Pierce). Cell lysates from ACVI virus-infected or uninfected cardiac myocytes were incubated with GST-RalGDS-RBD fusion protein. The active GTP-Rap1 pulled down from lysate was detected by immunoblotting using anti-Rap1 antibody. Cells stimulated with Epac activator, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (8-CPT, 100 μm, 15 min), were used as a positive control (11Morel E. Marcantoni A. Gastineau M. Birkedal R. Rochais F. Garnier A. Lompré A.M. Vandecasteele G. Lezoualc'h F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and cells were stimulated with Epac inhibitor, Brefeldin A (100 μm, 15 min), were used as a negative control (12Zhong N. Zucker R.S. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis—Immunoblotting analysis for detection of Akt and its phosphorylated forms was performed according to the protocol from Cell Signaling using cardiac myocyte extracts. Total cell lysate (20 μg) from each condition was separated (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to membrane. The phospho-PLB protein was detected using anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) or (Thr-17) antibody (1:3000). Total PLB protein was detected using a monoclonal anti-PLB antibody (1:500). The Akt and phospho-Akt proteins were detected using anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) or (Thr-308) antibodies (1:1000). Immunofluorescence Staining—Cardiac myocytes were fixed with 10% formalin solution for 15 min at 23 °C. Fixed cells were washed four times with PBS. Cells were blocked with normal goat serum for 1 h and incubated with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (1:200) for 1 h at 23 °C. The cells were washed four times with PBS and then incubated for another hour with a secondary antibody that was conjugated with Alexa Fluo 488. To stain the nucleus, cells were washed and incubated with Hoechst dye (1:1000) for 20 min. Stained cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Images were obtained with a 40× lens using a DeltaVision system and were subjected to deconvolution (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). Images were captured with a CoolSnap camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). To enable comparison, exposure times were identical for each fluorophore and kept within the linear range of the camera. ACVI Gene Transfer Increases Phospholamban Phosphorylation—As expected, phosphorylation of PLB on both Ser-16 and Thr-17 was increased in cardiac myocytes by isoproterenol (βAR stimulation) and forskolin (AC activation) (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3 versus lane 1). However, we found that, in the absence of βAR activation, ACVI gene transfer alone increased PLB phosphorylation on serine 16 (Fig. 1, top row, lane 4 versus lane 1), but not on Thr-17 (Fig. 1, bottom row, lane 4 versus lane 1). Isoproterenol and forskolin did not further increase ACVI-induced phospho-PLB on Ser-16 (Fig. 1, top row, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 4). Isoproterenol was able to induce Thr-17 phosphorylation to a similar level as in uninfected cells (bottom row, lane 5 versus lane 2). However, forskolin was not able to induce Thr-17 phosphorylation (bottom row, lane 6 versus lane 4). Cardiac myocytes infected with Ad.EGFP acted similar to uninfected cells (data not shown). PLB with a single site (Ser-16) phosphorylation has been shown to be sufficient in mediating its maximal cardiac responses to β-agonists (13Chu G. Lester J.W. Young K.B. Luo W. Zhai J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38938-38943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The following studies were focused on determining the mechanisms for ACVI-associated Ser-16 phosphorylation of phospholamban. ACVI-induced PLB Phosphorylation Does Not Require βAR Stimulation—To determine whether catecholamines in the media were contributing to PLB phosphorylation after ACVI gene transfer, two approaches were used. First, fetal bovine serum was dialyzed to eliminate catecholamines. No difference in ACVI-induced PLB phosphorylation was found between myocytes cultured in dialyzed and undialyzed serum (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4 versus lanes 1 and 2), indicating that increased PLB phosphorylation associated with ACVI gene transfer did not stem from low levels of catecholamines in media. Second, βAR blockade with a β1AR antagonist (CGP20712A, 1 μm and 10 μm) and a β2AR antagonist (ICI118,551, 1 μm and 10 μm) did not reduce phosphorylation of PLB (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8 versus lane 2), confirming that ACVI-induced PLB phosphorylation was independent of βAR stimulation. ACVI Gene Transfer Increases PLB Phosphorylation Independently of PKA and Epac—Using several approaches, we examined the potential role of PKA activation in PLB phosphorylation associated with ACVI gene transfer. First, we measured PKA catalytic α-isoform (PKA-Cα) expression (immunoblotting) using an antibody against total PKA-Cα and phospho-PKA-Cα (Thr-197). ACVI gene transfer did not affect PKA-Cα subunit expression or its phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Second, although PKA activity was increased 5-fold in response to βAR (isoproterenol) and AC (NKH477) stimulations in ACVI-infected cells, basal PKA activity was unaltered by ACVI (Fig. 3B). Finally, specific inhibition of PKA did not block Ad.ACVI-associated PLB phosphorylation (shown below in Fig. 8, E and F). These data correlate with the effects of ACVI on intracellular cAMP levels: ACVI gene transfer does not change basal cAMP levels, but cAMP production in response to βAR or AC stimulation are increased (10Gao M.H. Ping P. Post S. Insel P.A. Tang R. Hammond H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Gao M.H. Lai N.C. Roth D.M. Zhou J. Anzai T. Dalton N. Hammond H.K. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1618-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 15Gao M.H. Bayat H. Zhou J.Y. Roth D.M. Drumm J.D. Burhan J. Hammond H.K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that increased PLB phosphorylation evoked by ACVI occurs by a mechanism that does not involve PKA. ACVI gene transfer was not associated with activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) (Fig. 3C), which was in line with the lack of PLB phosphorylation on Thr-17 (Fig. 1).FIGURE 8A, phosphorylation of PLB by recombinant Akt1. GST/PLB recombinant protein was produced and purified from bacteria. GST/PLB-bound agarose beads (2 μl) were incubated (10 min, 30 °C) with increasing amounts of Akt1 in the presence of ATP and kinase buffer. Phospho-Ser-16-PLB was detected using anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) antibody. Recombinant Akt phosphorylated PLB at Ser-16. B, wild type and mutants of GST-PLB around serine 16. Serine 16 is defined as “0,” and amino acids at 5′ of serine 16 were defined as negatives. The mut-7, mut-3, and mut-2 have an “R” mutated to “A,” and mut-5 has an “A” mutated to an “R” by site-directed mutagenesis. C, immunoblots of WT and mutants of GST-PLB phosphorylated by Akt1. WT or mutant GST-PLB protein was phosphorylated by Akt1 (100 ng) as described in A, and phospho-Ser-16 was detected using anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) antibody. Mutation at -5 increased PLB phosphorylation by Akt, but mutation at -2 and -3 completely abolished the ability of Akt1 to phosphorylate PLB Ser-16. D, phosphorylation of WT and mutants of GST-PLB by Akt1 at varies substrate concentrations. Phospho-Ser-16 was detected in immunoblotting using anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) antibody. The graph was plotted by intensity of phospho-PLB-Ser-16 on immunoblotting versus concentration of each GST-PLB protein. Because mutation at -2 and -3 completely abolished the ability of Akt1 to phosphorylate PLB at Ser-16, these mutants were not included in the graph. E, Akt phosphorylation of PLB in cardiac myocytes. Ad.ACVI-infected cardiac myocytes received no inhibitor (-), Akt inhibitor (Akt, 10 μm); Akt inhibitor II (Akt II, 10 μm); Akt inhibitor V (10 μm, data not shown); or PKA inhibitor (PKI, 10 μm) for 24 h. Lysates from each condition were separated (SDS-PAGE), and phospho-Ser-16-PLB was detected using phospho-specific antibody. ACVI gene transfer increased phosphorylation of PLB (lane 2 versus lane 1). Inhibition of Akt prevented PLB phosphorylation (lane 3), but PKA inhibition had no effect (lane 4). F, PKA inhibitors (PKI, 20 μm, Rp-8-CPT-cAMP (Rp8), 20 μm and H89, 10 μm) were incubated with cardiac myocytes for 24 h and phospho-PLB at Ser-16 or phospho-Akt at Ser473 were detected in immunoblotting as described above. PKA was not involved in ACVI-induced PLB and Akt phosphorylation in vivo.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the Epac signaling pathway was activated by ACVI gene transfer, intracellular active Rap1 was quantified. We found no difference in Rap1 activity between ACVI virus-infected and uninfected myocytes, with or without serum. The Epac activator (8-CPT) slightly increased active Rap1, but again, in both ACVI virus-infected and uninfected myocytes (Fig. 3D). Therefore, gene transfer of AC6 did not activate the Epac signaling pathway. AC Catalytic Activity Is Not Required for Phosphorylation of PLB and Akt—To determine whether catalytic activation of AC is required for PLB or Akt phosphorylation, we used AC P-site inhibitors. Two P-site inhibitors (SQ22536 and 9-CPA) (16Gao Y. Usha Raj J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 436: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 17Onda T. Hashimoto Y. Nagai M. Kuramochi H. Saito S.

Another P-site inhibitor, foscarnet (a pyrophosphate analog), was able to inhibit AC activity in uninfected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4B), but did not inhibit AC activity in ACVI virus-infected myocytes (Fig. 4, A and C), which suggest that endogenous AC isoforms and increased ACVI have different sensitivities to foscarnet inhibition (19Kudlacek O.

None of these reagents inhibited ACVI-associated phosphorylation of PLB or Akt (Fig. 4D), indicating that the catalytic activation of transgene ACVI is not required for its effects on PLB or Akt phosphorylation. ACVI Gene Transfer Increases Akt Phosphorylation and Activity—ACVI gene transfer increased phosphorylation of Akt at both the Ser-473 and Thr-308 sites but did not change the levels of Akt protein (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Akt phosphorylation was associated with increased Akt activity, Akt was immunoprecipitated from cardiac myocyte lysates, and activity was assessed using recombinant GSK3α/β fusion protein as a substrate in vitro. ACVI gene transfer increased Akt activity 5-fold versus Ad.EGFP-infected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5B, lane 2 versus lane 1). Sustained (22 h) βAR stimulation increased Akt activity in control cells (Fig. 5B, lane 3 versus lane 1) but not further enhance Akt activity in Ad.ACVI-infected cells (Fig. 5B, lane 4 versus lane 2). We next determined whether phosphorylation of GSK-3, an endogenous Akt substrate, was increased after ACVI gene transfer. GSK-3 phosphorylation was detected using antibodies against its α- and β-isoforms. We found that ACVI gene transfer increased phosphorylation of Ser-21 on the α-isoform and Ser-9 on the β-isoform (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Consequences of ACVI gene transfer and Akt activation. Phosphorylation of GSK3, an Akt substrate. Cardiac myocyte lysates from each condition were separated (SDS-PAGE), and phosphorylation of GSK3 α on Ser-21 and Ser-9 was detected by immunoblotting analysis using anti-phospho-GSK3 antibodies. ACVI gene transfer increased phosphorylation of GSK3 in cardiac myocytes (lane 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ACVI Gene Transfer Increased Nuclear Phospho-Akt—To detect the intracellular location of Akt, we used anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody and immunofluorescence staining followed by deconvolution analysis. In uninfected cardiac myocytes, phospho-Akt was detected in the cytoplasm, but was barely detectable in the nucleus. In contrast, after ACVI gene transfer, nuclear phospho-Akt was substantially increased (Fig. 7). As previously shown (Fig. 5), Akt activation did not require βAR stimulation. ACVI Gene Transfer Increases PLB Phosphorylation via Akt—To determine if PLB was an Akt substrate in the setting of increased ACVI expression, we used three approaches. First, using GST-PLB fusion as substrate, we asked whether recombinant Akt protein could phosphorylate PLB Ser-16 in vitro. Phospho-PLB Ser-16 was detected using anti-phospho-PLB (Ser-16) antibody in immunoblotting after kinase reaction. We found that Akt phosphorylated PLB on Ser-16 in vitro (Fig. 8A). To determine the amino acids around Ser-16 required for Akt phosphorylation, 3 arginines in PLB (RXAXRRXS) were mutated to alanines (called mut-2, mut-3, and mut-7, respectively). In addition, the alanine at position -5 was changed to arginine (called mut-5) to mimic an Akt consensus site (RXRXXpS) as shown in Fig. 8B. The PLB-WT and mutants of GST-PLB were tested for phosphorylation by recombinant active Akt1 in vitro. Although mut-5 increased (1.7-fold) the amount of PLB phosphorylation when compared with WT, mutation at -7 reduced PLB phosphorylation >95%, and mutation at -2 or -3 site completely abolished PLB phosphorylation by Akt (Fig. 8, C and D). These data confirmed that PLB is one of the Akt substrates and that the three arginines at -2, -3, and -7 are critical for Akt to phosphorylate PLB. Second, using synthesized PLB peptide (RSAIRRAST), we determined the kinetics of recombinant Akt1 phosphorylation on PLB Ser-16 in vitro. In this experiment, we used an Akt consensus peptide, RPRAATF, as a positive control and PLB Ser-16 mutant as a negative control. An additional mutant on Thr-17, was used to evaluate the specificity of the phosphorylation. After tittering, the amount of Akt kinase and the reaction time were found to be in the lineage range, and various concentrations of PLB substrate were phosphorylated by 100 ng of Akt1 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The Km and Vmax of the phosphorylation were calculated using a nonlinear least-square best fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. We found that, although recombinant active Akt1 phosphorylated its consensus site with Km of 30 μm, it phosphorylated PLB peptide with Km of 72 μm and Vmax of 143 nmol/min/mg. Mutation at Thr-17 did not affect Akt phosphorylation of PLB on Ser-16, but mutation at Ser-16 completely abolished PLB phosphorylation, confirming the specificity of the phosphorylation (data not shown). These results indicated that PLB is one of the relative specific Akt substrates, which is consistent with the findings of others for these non-consensus Akt substrates (20Suresh Babu C.V. Cho S.G. Yoo Y.S. Electrophoresis. 2005; 26: 3765-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Alessi D.R. Caudwell F.B. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Finally, we used Akt inhibitors to attempt to prevent phosphorylation of endogenous PLB. All three Akt inhibitors, in contrast to PKA inhibitors, blocked ACVI-associated PLB phosphorylation (Fig."

Purified NS5B has been reported to exhibit multiple activities in vitro. Using a synthetic heteropolymeric RNA template with dideoxycytidine at its 3'-end, we examined de novo initiation and primer extension in a system devoid of self-priming and terminal nucleotide transferase activities. Products predominantly of template size and its multiples were detected. High concentrations of nucleoside triphosphates (K(app)(m) approximately 100-400 mum) corresponding to the first three incorporated nucleotides were found to be required for efficient de novo RNA synthesis. In the presence of initiating di- or trinucleotides, however, the amount of NTP needed to achieve maximal activity dropped 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold, revealing a much reduced nucleotide requirement for elongation (K(app)(m) approximately 0.03-0.09 microm). Accordingly, single round extension from an exogenous primer following preincubation of the enzyme with template and primer could also be supported by <0.1 microm levels of NTP. De novo synthesis at high NTP concentrations was shown to be preferred over primer extension. On a dideoxycytidine-blocked synthetic RNA template derived from the 3'-end of the HCV(-)UTR, the addition of the corresponding initiating trinucleotide also dramatically reduced the NTP levels needed to achieve efficient RNA synthesis. Thus, distinct nucleotide requirements exist for initiation and elongation steps catalyzed by the HCV NS5B polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W2003244012,"SurA is a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) and chaperone of Escherichia coli and other Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to other PPIases, SurA appears to have a distinct role in chaperoning newly synthesized porins destined for insertion into the outer membrane. Previous studies have indicated that the chaperone activity of SurA rests in its ""core module"" (the N- plus C-terminal domains), based on in vivo envelope phenotypes and in vitro binding and protection of non-native substrates.In this study, we determined the components of SurA required for chaperone activity using in vivo phenotypes relevant to disease causation by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), namely membrane resistance to permeation by antimicrobials and maturation of the type 1 pilus usher FimD. FimD is a SurA-dependent, integral outer membrane protein through which heteropolymeric type 1 pili, which confer bladder epithelial binding and invasion capacity upon uropathogenic E. coli, are assembled and extruded. Consistent with prior results, the in vivo chaperone activity of SurA in UPEC rested primarily in the core module. However, the PPIase domains I and II were not expendable for wild-type resistance to novobiocin in broth culture. Steady-state levels of FimD were substantially restored in the UPEC surA mutant complemented with the SurA N- plus C-terminal domains. The addition of PPIase domain I augmented FimD maturation into the outer membrane, consistent with a model in which domain I enhances stability of and/or substrate binding by the core module.Our results confirm the core module of E. coli SurA as a potential target for novel anti-infective development."
https://openalex.org/W2148243778,"MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1) is well known for its role in providing multidrug resistance to cancer cells. In addition, MRP1 has been associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions in nonmalignant cells. The pro-inflammatory function is evident from the fact that MRP1 is a high affinity transporter for cysteinyl-leukotriene C4 (LTC4), a lipid mediator of inflammation. It remains unexplained, however, why the absence of Mrp1 leads to increased intestinal epithelial damage in mice treated with dextran-sodium sulfate, a model for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We found that MRP1 expression is induced in the inflamed intestine of IBD patients, e.g. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. Increased MRP1 expression was detected at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. To study a putative role for MRP1 in protecting epithelial cells against inflammatory cues, we manipulated MRP1 levels in human epithelial DLD-1 cells and exposed these cells to cytokines and anti-Fas. Inhibition of MRP1 (by MK571 or RNA interference) resulted in increased cytokine- and anti-Fas-induced apoptosis of DLD-1 cells. Opposite effects, e.g. protection of DLD-1 cells against cytokine- and anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, were observed after recombinant MRP1 overexpression. Inhibition of LTC4 synthesis reduced anti-Fas-induced apoptosis when MRP1 function was blocked, suggesting that LTC4 is the pro-apoptotic compound exported by epithelial MRP1 during inflammation. These data show that MRP1 protects intestinal epithelial cells against inflammation-induced apoptotic cell death and provides a functional role for MRP1 in the inflamed intestinal epithelium of IBD patients.

The (putative) functions of the proteins they encode corroborate the notion that the primary cause for the development of IBD originates from a dysregulated immune response to commensal intestinal bacteria, defects in mucosal barrier function, and/or bacterial clearance. inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis Crohn disease leukotriene C4 ATP-binding cassette transporters multidrug resistance-associated protein poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase short interfering RNA tumor necrosis factor-α green fluorescent protein Irrespective of the genetic cause, severe and continuous inflammation causes damage to the intestinal epithelium that may strongly affect its absorptive and secretory functions as well as its protective role against toxic compounds.

Moreover, we recently showed that MDR1 expression is strongly reduced in the inflamed intestine of IBD patients, which may further aggravate the disease (11Blokzijl H. Vander B.S. Bok L.I.

MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, encoded by the ABCC1 gene) also plays a role in inflammatory responses. It transports glutathione and substrates that are conjugated to reduced glutathione, glucuronide, or sulfate as part of the detoxification machinery of (cancer) cells (12Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar, 13Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G.

The glutathione conjugate leukotriene C4 (LTC4) has been identified as an endogenous, high affinity substrate for MRP1 (14Samuelsson B.

Leukotrienes are important lipid mediators of inflammatory responses and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including IBD (14Samuelsson B.

The role of Mrp1 in the inflammatory signaling pathway is evident from studies with Mrp1-/- knock-out mice that show a strongly reduced response to arachidonic acid-induced inflammatory stimuli as measured by decreased ear edema and vascular permeability (18Wijnholds J. Evers R. van Leusden M.R. Mol C.A. Zaman G.J. Mayer U. Beijnen J.H. van der Valk M. Krimpenfort P. Borst P. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Relevant for IBD, however, it was shown that intestinal damage was significantly aggravated in Mrp1-/- knock-out mice exposed to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis (19Ten Hove T. Drillenburg P. Wijnholds J. Te Velde A.A. Van Deventer S.J. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2056-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These animal studies suggest that Mrp1 serves a dual role during inflammation, both sending out inflammatory signals as well as protecting the intestinal epithelium. The mechanism of the latter and the relevance for IBD patients are unknown to date. In this study, we show that MRP1 expression is increased in the inflamed epithelium of patients with IBD, in particular in the intestinal crypts. We demonstrate that MRP1 protects intestinal epithelial cells against cytokine-induced cell death by exporting pro-apoptotic compounds from the cysteinyl leukotriene biosynthesis pathway. Patient Characteristics—Intestinal mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained during endoscopy following informed consent from patients with IBD. Diagnosis of IBD was established by endoscopic and histopathological examination. The Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Groningen approved the protocol (METc 2002/177c). Intestinal biopsies were obtained from macroscopically inflamed and noninflamed mucosa from 35 patients with IBD using a standard biopsy forceps. Intestinal specimens were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for mRNA and protein analysis or liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane for immunohistochemical staining and stored at -80 °C until further processing. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed with the mouse monoclonal antibody QCRL-3 against MRP1 on frozen sections according to the protocol described (dilution 1:10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) (20Vander B.S. Libbrecht L. Blokzijl H. Faber K.N. Moshage H. Aerts R. Van Steenbergen W. Jansen P.L. Desmet V.J. Roskams T.A. J. Pathol. 2005; 207: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative controls consisted of omission of the primary antibody and were consistently negative. Cell Culture—The human colon carcinoma cell line DLD-1 was cultured as described previously (21Dijkstra G. Blokzijl H. Bok L. Homan M. van Goor H. Faber K.N. Jansen P.L. Moshage H. J. Pathol. 2004; 204: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). DLD-1 cells were treated with anti-Fas (Immunotech, Marseille, France) or human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (R & D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK). The LTD4 receptor antagonist MK571 (3-([[3-(2-[7-chloro-2-quinolinyl]ethenyl)-phenyl}-((3-(dimethylamino-3-oxopropyl)-thio)-methyl]thio)propanoic acid; Alexis Biochemicals, Lausen, Switzerland) was used to inhibit MRP function. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor AA861 (2-(12-hydroxydodeca-5,10-diynyl)-3,5,6-trimethyl-p-benzoquinone; Sigma) was used to inhibit leukotriene synthesis from arachidonic acid. siRNA-mediated Reduction of MRP1 Expression—DLD-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400,000 cells per well in RPMI 1640 medium with glutamax supplemented with 1! fetal bovine serum. After 4 h, medium was replaced by serum-free medium. DLD1 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA-MRP1 duplexes using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. siRNA-MRP1 primers were obtained from Invitrogen (sense 5′-GGA GUG GAA CCC CUC UCU GdTdT-3′ and antisense 5′-CAG AGA GGG GUU CCA CUC CdTdT-3′; kindly provided by Dr. D. J. de Groot, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Control cells were treated with only Oligofectamine. Four hours after transfection, medium was supplemented with RPMI 1640 medium with 30! fetal bovine serum to adjust the serum concentration to 10!. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C and 5! CO2 for 48 h. MRP1 RNA and protein expression was then analyzed by real time PCR and Western blot analysis. MRP1 Overexpressing Cell Line—DLD-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 300,000 cells per well. The cells were transfected with plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)-MRP1-GFP (22Ito K. Olsen S.L. Qiu W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15616-15624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using the Transfectin™ lipid reagent protocol (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were grown to 70! confluence before adding 0.625 mg/ml geneticin to the medium. After 3 days colonies were selected and expanded in medium containing 0.625 mg/ml geneticin. Two clones were further purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting based on the GFP signal to obtain homogeneous MRP1-expressing cell lines. RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated as described (23Plass J.R. Mol O. Heegsma J. Geuken M. Faber K.N. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Hepatology. 2002; 35: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). RNA integrity was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and RNA concentration was measured using a Ribogreen RNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). cDNA synthesis was performed on 2.5 μg of total RNA using random primers in a final volume of 50 μl (reverse transcription system, Promega, Madison, WI). For real time PCR, 4 μl of 20-fold diluted cDNA was used for every PCR in a final volume of 20 μl, containing 900 nmol/liter sense and antisense primers, 200 nmol/liter fluorogenic probe, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 0.2 mmol/liter deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 2 μl of real time PCR buffer (10×), and 0.5 units of Hot Goldstar DNA polymerase (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Details about primers and probes are described in supplemental Table S1. Real time PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector version 1.6 software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The expression of genes was normalized to the endogenous control (18 S). Western Blot—Total cell lysates of DLD-1 cells were separated by 10! SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay system (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human PARP (dilution 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), mouse monoclonal antibody glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (dilution 1:5000; Calbiochem), and rat monoclonal antibody MRPr1 were used (dilution 1:500) (24Scheffer G.L.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5269-5277PubMed Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled swine anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies (dilutions 1:2500; DAKO, Heverlee, Belgium). The blots were exposed in a ChemiDoc XRS system (Bio-Rad). The intensity of the protein bands were quantified using Quantity One software. Caspase-3 Assay—Caspase-3 enzyme activity was determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using a caspase-3 activity kit with fluorimetric detection (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). Data Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago). Data obtained from the different groups are expressed as mean values ± S.D. Different groups were compared using Mann-Whitney U-tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Expression of MRP1 in Inflamed and Uninflamed Intestinal Tissue—To study the effect of inflammation on ABC transporter expression in the intestinal epithelium, we analyzed bordering mucosal biopsies from uninflamed and inflamed tissue from patients with IBD. In an initial screening, expression of MRP1–6 and MDR1 was analyzed in biopsies from five IBD patients (three with UC and two with CD). MRP1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in inflamed intestinal mucosa, whereas MDR1 expression was down-regulated (Fig. 1A), as described earlier (11Blokzijl H. Vander B.S. Bok L.I. Libbrecht L. Geuken M. van den Heuvel F.A. Dijkstra G. Roskams T.A. Moshage H. Jansen P.L. Faber K.N. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2007; 13: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of MRP2–6 were similar in uninflamed and inflamed intestinal tissue of IBD patients (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, biopsies from 15 UC patients and 20 CD patients were analyzed. Inducible nitric-oxide synthase expression was determined as a measure of inflammation in the biopsies (Fig. 1B). Also in this larger cohort of IBD patients, MRP1 expression was significantly increased in inflamed intestinal mucosa in both UC and CD (Fig. 1C), and MDR1 expression was decreased in both IBD subgroups (Fig. 1D). Immunohistochemistry for MRP1 on colonic biopsy material with high grade inflammation showed a clear basolateral staining of intestinal epithelial cells as well as MRP1-positive mononuclear cells. Notably, MRP1 staining intensity was homogeneous in the epithelial cells lining the whole crypt, whereas the surface epithelium showed minimal MRP1-specific staining (Fig. 1E). In parallel experiments, the uninflamed tissue from these patients remained unstained for MRP1 (data not shown). Effect of MK571-mediated Inhibition of MRPs on Anti-Fas- and TNF-α-induced Apoptosis—Increased MRP1 levels may aid cell protection during gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases. Cell damage/death may be induced through receptor-mediated apoptosis in response to FasL or TNF-α, as shown previously in the intestinal mucosa of IBD patients (25Zeissig S. Bojarski C. Buergel N.

To study this putative function, we performed in vitro experiments using the human colon epithelial cell line DLD-1. Both human colon biopsies and DLD-1 cells show significant expression of MDR1 and various MRPs, including MRP1 (Fig. 2). This makes DLD-1 cells a useful model for MRP1 inhibition and overexpression studies. First, we tested whether chemical inhibition of MRP-function by MK571 affected DLD-1 cell survival during exposure to anti-Fas or TNF-α. As reported by others (28Hayashi H. Tatebe S. Osaki M. Goto A.

Concurrently, significant amounts of activated (cleaved) PARP were detected after 16 h of TNF-α (Fig. 3B) or 8 h of anti-Fas (Fig. 3E) treatment. Adding MK571 strongly increased caspase-3 activities in both TNF-α- and anti-Fas-treated cells (Fig. 3, A and D), which was accompanied by a further increase in the amount of cleaved PARP (Fig. 3, B and E). The increase of TNF-α- or anti-Fas-induced apoptosis was dependent on the concentration of MK571 causing a significant increase of TNF-α- and anti-Fas-induced apoptosis at concentrations as low as 6.25 μm (Fig. 3, C and F). MK571 (up to 50 μm tested) itself did not induce caspase-3 activity in DLD-1 cells. Taken together, these results show that inhibition of MRP function strongly sensitizes DLD-1 cells for TNF-α- or anti-Fas-induced apoptosis.FIGURE 3Effect of MK-571 on anti-Fas- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis of DLD-1 cells.

To study the function of MRP1 in this process, we selectively repressed its expression by RNA interference. DLD-1 cells were transiently transfected with MRP1-specific siRNA duplexes, and after 48 h, MRP1 mRNA (Fig. 4A) and protein (Fig. 4, B and C) levels were significantly reduced to ∼40! of control cells. Exposure of the siRNA-MRP1-treated DLD-1 cells to anti-Fas led to significantly increased caspase-3 levels (2.0-fold; Fig. 4D). These data show that specific inhibition of MRP1 sensitizes DLD-1 cells to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis and that other MRPs expressed in DLD-1 cells are not able to fully compensate for the loss of MRP1 function. Stable Overexpression of MRP1 in DLD-1 Cells—Next, we generated DLD-1 cell lines that overexpress MRP1 to examine whether this would increase the resistance of these cells against anti-Fas- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis. DLD-1-derivative cell lines, DLD-MRP1-GFP clone 1 and DLD-MRP1-GFP clone 2, stably overexpress MRP1 tagged at its C terminus to the green fluorescent protein (MRP1-GFP). Previously, it has been shown that this MRP1-GFP hybrid protein retains its substrate transport activity (32Cole S.P. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar). DLD-MRP1-GFP1 and DLD-MRP1-GFP2 contained 17- and 35-fold increased MRP1 mRNA levels, respectively (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis revealed a strong MRP1-specific signal at ∼220 kDa, the expected size of the hybrid protein consisting of MRP1 (190 kDa) and GFP (30 kDa) (Fig. 5B). In normal DLD-1 cells, only the endogenous MRP1 protein of ∼190 kDa was detected. Fluorescence microscopic analysis to determine the subcellular location of the GFP signal revealed a predominant plasma membrane staining in the DLD-MRP1-GFP clones (Fig. 5C), which was not detected in the native DLD-1 cells (data not shown). Exposure of the MRP1 overproducing cell lines to anti-Fas or TNF-α resulted in significantly lower caspase-3 activities and PARP cleavage compared with the native DLD-1 cells (Fig. 5, D–F). Notably, we observed an inverse correlation between the MRP1-GFP expression level and the level of anti-Fas- or TNF-α-induced apoptosis in these cells. These data imply that MRP1 is able to protect cells from anti-Fas- or TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of Cysteinyl Leukotriene Biosynthesis—Inflammation induces the conversion of arachidonic acid into cysteinyl leukotrienes. LTC4 is a high affinity substrate for MRP1 that is converted to the anti-apoptotic LTD4 after cellular export. We studied whether blocking MRP function results in the accumulation of a pro-apoptotic compound or, alternatively, prevents the extracellular formation of an anti-apoptotic compound. The lipoxygenase inhibitor AA861 was used to prevent leukotriene synthesis from arachidonic acid. AA861 alone does not induce caspase-3 activity in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 6A). Co-treatment of DLD-1 cells with anti-Fas and increasing amounts of AA861, however, results in a dose-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity. This is probably due to the accumulation of pro-apoptotic arachidonic acid (33Penzo D. Petronilli V. Angelin A. Cusan C. Colonna R. Scorrano L. Pagano F. Prato M. Di Lisa F. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Cao Y. Pearman A.T. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11280-11285Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Crucial is the observation that the caspase-3 activity in anti-Fas/AA861-treated cells is significantly lower than that in anti-Fas/MK571-treated cells (Fig. 6A). When DLD-1 cells were then co-treated with anti-Fas, MK571, and increasing amounts of AA861, a dose-dependent decrease in caspase-3 activity was observed (Fig. 6A). At the highest concentration of AA861 (20 μm), caspase-3 activity in the anti-Fas/MK571/AA861-treated cells was reduced to levels comparable with anti-Fas/AA861-treated DLD-1 cells (Fig. 6A). These data imply that blocking leukotriene synthesis by AA861 results in the accumulation of a proapoptotic compound (arachidonic acid) in anti-Fas-treated DLD-1 cells. However, AA861 prevents the intracellular accumulation of an even more potent pro-apoptotic compound in anti-Fas/MK571-treated DLD-1 cells, which is a substrate for MRP1 (Fig. 6B shows a schematic representation of LTC4 biosynthesis and export and the position and effect of the inhibitors used in this study). In this study, we show that the ABC transporter MRP1 is induced in inflamed intestinal epithelial cells of patients with IBD. Pharmacological inhibition of MRP function increased anti-Fas- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis of DLD-1 cells. Specific reduction of MRP1 expression by RNA interference sensitizes DLD-1 cells for anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. Anti-Fas- and TNF-α-induced apoptosis was reduced in DLD-1 cells stably overexpressing MRP1 or when the intracellular accumulation of its high affinity substrate, LTC4, was prevented by inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase. MRP1 is best known for its ability to protect tumor cells by stimulating an efflux of drugs that will otherwise induce apoptosis or necrosis of these cells (35Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). However, MRP1 is also expressed in normal (nonmalignant) tissues such as the colon where it is specifically present in crypt cells that form the proliferative cell compartment of the gut (32Cole S.P. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar, 36Flens M.J. Zaman G.J. van der Valk P. Izquierdo M.A. Schroeijers A.B.

Haefeli W.E. Weiss J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 70: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this may protect these cells against damage induced by xenobiotics (38Haimeur A. Conseil G. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Curr. Drug Metab. 2004; 5: 21-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We observed that during intestinal inflammation, MRP1 levels were significantly induced. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected a clear basolateral staining for MRP1 of the crypt cells of the inflamed intestine. The increase in MRP1 expression was not part of a general induction of cytoprotective efflux systems, because the expression of another ABC transporter MDR1 was decreased under these conditions (11Blokzijl H. Vander B.S. Bok L.I. Libbrecht L. Geuken M. van den Heuvel F.A. Dijkstra G. Roskams T.A. Moshage H. Jansen P.L. Faber K.N. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2007; 13: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, MRP1 may have a specific role in protecting crypt intestinal epithelial cells during inflammation. We provide four lines of evidence for such a function of MRP1. First, pharmacological inhibition (by MK571) of MRPs strongly increases cytokine- (TNF-α) and anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in DLD-1 cells. Many earlier studies reported that cytokines or anti-Fas induce apoptosis in intestinal and other cell types/lines (28Hayashi H. Tatebe S. Osaki M. Goto A. Sato K. Ito H. Apoptosis. 1998; 3: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Han S.Y. Choung S.Y. Paik I.S. Kang H.J. Choi Y.H. Kim S.J. Lee M.O. Biol. Pharm.

Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1962-1974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but this is the first time that a protective role for an MRP transporter in this process is described. Apparently, exposure to anti-Fas or TNF-α leads to intracellular processes that give rise to apoptotic compounds that are substrates for MRPs. Others have shown that anti-Fas-induced apoptosis is associated with rapid extrusion of reduced glutathione, which precedes apoptotic cell death (41Hammond C.L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. J. Hepatol. 2001; 34: 946-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 42van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). MRP1 has been suggested to be the transporter responsible for glutathione export under these conditions (43Hammond C.L. Marchan R. Krance S.M. Ballatori N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14337-14347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Blocking MRP1-dependent export of glutathione in anti-Fas-treated Jurkat cells led to a decrease in apoptosis, the exact opposite of what we detected for DLD-1 cells. It is relevant to note that controversy exists in recent literature in which transporter(s) are responsible for glutathione export in apoptotic cells. Others have suggested that organic onion transport proteins and not MRPs in Jurkat cells are responsible for this effect (44Franco R. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29542-29557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We further studied the opposite effect of MRP inhibition on anti-Fas-induced apoptosis of T lymphocyte cell lines (Jurkat and MOLT-4) and DLD-1. 4A. van Steenpaal, G. Dijkstra, M. Geuken, T. Blokzijl, L. I. H. B. K., H. Moshage, M. Peppelenbosch, and K. N. Faber, submitted for publication. We show that cellular glutathione levels are only marginally affected under our experimental conditions and that glutathione depletion is unlikely to be the primary inducting condition for apoptosis in Jurkat and DLD-1 cells. Second, specific repression of MRP1 expression (by RNA interference) sensitizes DLD-1 cells for anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. The increased level of apoptosis when expression of specifically MRP1 is reduced shows that, of the MRPs present in DLD-1 cells, MRP1 plays the predominant role in cytoprotection against anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. Third, and in line with the previous observation, recombinant overexpression of MRP1 in DLD-1 cells dose-dependently reduced apoptosis induced by anti-Fas or TNF-α. These data suggest that these compounds induce the intracellular production of an apoptotic compound for which MRP1 is the most important efflux pump. TNF-α and anti-Fas are known to induce apoptosis by activation of membrane receptors (TNF-receptor, Fas) (45Reed J.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1415-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Once activated, these receptors recruit adaptor proteins that initiate a signaling pathway, which ultimately leads to activation of effector caspases that mediate apoptosis. No obvious substrate is present in this signaling pathway that may be exported by MRP1, thereby preventing apoptosis. However, TNF-α or anti-Fas may also induce apoptosis through the release of arachidonic acid from the membrane after activation of Ca2+-dependent cytosolic phospholipases (46Taketo M.M. Sonoshita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid stimulates apoptosis through activation of sphingomyelinase and through its downstream metabolites, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Gastrointestinal epithelial cells have been shown to be able to produce these compounds (47Luo M. Lee S. Brock T.G. Histol. Histopathol. 2003; 18: 587-595PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed and as the fourth line of evidence, we found that blocking the biosynthesis of leukotrienes leads to a reduction in TNF-α- or anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in DLD-1 cells with an inhibited MRP function. Because LTC4 is a high affinity substrate of MRP1, we suggest that this is the pro-apoptotic compound during inflammatory conditions (15Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). MRP4 and MRP6 have also been shown to be able to transport LTC4 with relatively high affinity (48Nies A.T. Schwab M. Keppler D. Expert. Opin. Drug Metab. Toxicol. 2008; 4: 545-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 49Rius M. Hummel-Eisenbeiss J. Keppler D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2008; 324: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and both transporters are expressed in human intestinal tissue and DLD-1 cells. However, even a partial reduction of MRP1 in DLD-1 cells already leads to sensitization of these cells for anti-Fas-induced apoptosis. Apparently, MRP4 and/or MRP6 cannot fully compensate for the loss of MRP1 expression. Collectively, these data show that MRP1 has an important role in protecting the intestinal epithelium during inflammation. Our data correlate well with observations by Nishikawa et al. (50Nishikawa M. Hikasa Y. Hori K. Tanida N. Shimoyama T. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 30: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) who observed that inhibition of LTC4 synthesis is associated with decreased intestinal damage induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced colitis. In addition, Mrp1-/- mice have been shown to develop more severe colitis after administration of dextran sulfate sodium (19Ten Hove T. Drillenburg P. Wijnholds J. Te Velde A.A. Van Deventer S.J. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2056-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 50Nishikawa M. Hikasa Y. Hori K. Tanida N. Shimoyama T. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 30: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A cytoprotective role of MRP1 against inflammation-induced cell death may not be restricted to intestinal epithelial cells. Previously, we found that in livers of patients with severe hepatitis, hepatic progenitor cells contain high levels of MRP1 (51Ros J.E. Libbrecht L. Geuken M. Jansen P.L. Roskams T.A. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similar to the intestinal crypt cells, hepatic progenitor cells are involved in regeneration of damaged tissue during pathophysiological conditions. They need to survive in conditions when they are exposed to cytokines, toxic metabolites, and xenobiotics. MRP1 may be an important component of cellular cytoprotection during inflammation. In conclusion, our data show a novel function of MRP1, which is protection of intestinal epithelial cells against inflammation-induced apoptosis. MRP1 expression is increased in intestinal epithelial cells, in particular those lining the crypt, which may serve to preserve the intestinal regenerative capacity. We thank Dr. S. P.

https://openalex.org/W2077143772,"We aimed at evaluating the relative contribution of cyclooxygenase (COX) -1 and COX-2 to the synthesis of prostacyclin in endothelial cells under static conditions in the presence or absence of exogenous arachidonic acid and/or altered intracellular redox balance. Selective inhibitors of either COX-1 (SC560 and FR122047) or COX-2 (SC236) concentration dependently (1-300 nM) reduced basal and interleukin (IL) -1beta-induced prostacyclin production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by 70% or more; compound selectivity was confirmed using a whole-blood assay (IC(50) COX-1/COX-2: 13 nM/930 nM for SC-560; 9 microM/457 nM for SC-236). The observed concomitant formation of isoprostane appeared to be associated with COX enzyme activity, while formation of COX-1/COX-2 heterodimers was detected by immunoprecipitation. In the presence of arachidonic acid and 12-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid, either exogenous or provided by platelet activation, or after glutathione depletion, COX-1 inhibition but not COX-2 inhibition concentration dependently decreased prostacyclin production. Both isoforms appear to contribute to basal prostacyclin production by endothelial cells, with COX-2 providing the hydroperoxide tone required for COX-1 activity. Conversely, in the case of intracellular glutathione depletion or enhanced availability of arachidonic acid and hydroperoxides, selective COX-2 inhibition did not significantly affect the production of endothelial prostacyclin. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the effects of cyclooxygenase inhibitors on prostacyclin production."
https://openalex.org/W1993852034,"Despite sharing the same genes, identical twins demonstrate substantial variability in behavioral traits and in their risk for disease. Epigenetic factors-DNA and chromatin modifications that affect levels of gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence-are thought to be important in establishing this variability. Epigenetically-mediated differences in the levels of gene expression that are associated with individual variability traditionally are thought to occur only in a gene-specific manner. We challenge this idea by exploring the large-scale organizational patterns of gene expression in an epigenetic model of behavioral variability.To study the effects of epigenetic influences on behavioral variability, we examine gene expression in genetically identical mice. Using a novel approach to microarray analysis, we show that variability in the large-scale organization of gene expression levels, rather than differences in the expression levels of specific genes, is associated with individual differences in behavior. Specifically, increased activity in the open field is associated with increased variance of log-transformed measures of gene expression in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in open field activity. Early life experience that increases adult activity in the open field also similarly modifies the variance of gene expression levels. The same association of the variance of gene expression levels with behavioral variability is found with levels of gene expression in the hippocampus of genetically heterogeneous outbred populations of mice, suggesting that variation in the large-scale organization of gene expression levels may also be relevant to phenotypic differences in outbred populations such as humans. We find that the increased variance in gene expression levels is attributable to an increasing separation of several large, log-normally distributed families of gene expression levels. We also show that the presence of these multiple log-normal distributions of gene expression levels is a universal characteristic of gene expression in eurkaryotes. We use data from the MicroArray Quality Control Project (MAQC) to demonstrate that our method is robust and that it reliably detects biological differences in the large-scale organization of gene expression levels.Our results contrast with the traditional belief that epigenetic effects on gene expression occur only at the level of specific genes and suggest instead that the large-scale organization of gene expression levels provides important insights into the relationship of gene expression with behavioral variability. Understanding the epigenetic, genetic, and environmental factors that regulate the large-scale organization of gene expression levels, and how changes in this large-scale organization influences brain development and behavior will be a major future challenge in the field of behavioral genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2013061932,"Background The mitochondrial (mt) gene tree of placental mammals reveals a very strong acceleration of the amino acid (AA) replacement rate and a change in AA compositional bias in the lineage leading to the higher primates (simians), in contrast to the nuclear gene tree. Whether this acceleration and compositional bias were caused by adaptive evolution at the AA level or directional mutation pressure at the DNA level has been vigorously debated. Methodology/Principal Findings Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the rate acceleration in the simian lineage is accompanied by a marked increase in threonine (Thr) residues in the transmembrane helix regions of mt DNA-encoded proteins. This Thr increase involved the replacement of hydrophobic AAs in the membrane interior. Even after accounting for lack of independence due to phylogeny, a regression analysis reveals a statistical significant positive correlation between Thr composition and longevity in primates. Conclusion/Significance Because crucial roles of Thr and Ser in membrane proteins have been proposed to be the formation of hydrogen bonds enhancing helix-helix interactions, the Thr increase detected in the higher primates might be adaptive by serving to reinforce stability of mt proteins in the inner membrane. The correlation between Thr composition in the membrane interior and the longevity of animals is striking, especially because some mt functions are thought to be involved in aging."

Unexpectedly, the deletion of Thr-1 also caused a dramatic increase in the affinity between HslV and HslU even in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, the increase in the number of the Thr-1 deletion mutant subunit in place of HslV subunit in a dodecamer led to a proportional increase in the affinity between HslV and HslU with gradual activation of HslU ATPase.

Moreover, HslV that by itself is a weak peptidase can be activated 1–2 orders of magnitude by ATP-bound HslU (15Huang H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Oh J.Y. Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Importantly, chemical cross-linking analysis has shown that ATP-bound HslU interacts with HslV to form the HslVU complex, but ADP-bound HslU does not, implicating dynamic interaction between HslU and HslV during ATP hydrolysis cycles (17Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Seong I.S. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, it was unknown how the HslVU complex is maintained during threading of unfolded polypeptide from HslU into the inner chamber of HslV and subsequent cleavage of peptide bonds at the Thr-1 active sites for the completion of a proteolytic cycle. Unlike eukaryotic 20 S proteasomes where substrate accessibility to proteolytic active sites is controlled by opening-and-closing the apical gates of α subunits (19Forster A. Whitby F.G. Hill C.P.

Specifically, the C-terminal tails of HslU show a dramatic movement in a nucleotide-dependent manner (i.e. they move toward HslV-HslV subunit interfaces from HslU-HslU subunit interfaces when ATP is bound) (10Sousa M.C.

Moreover, a synthetic HslU tail peptide of 10 amino acids could replace HslU in the activation of HslV-mediated peptide hydrolysis (23Ramachandran R. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Huber R. Bochtler M. Proc.

Thus, it appears that HslU allosterically regulates the proteolytic function of HslV in a nucleotide-dependent fashion. On the other hand, relatively little is known about the role of HslV in the control of HslU function except for its ability to stimulate the ATPase activity several fold. In the present study we demonstrate that binding of proteasome inhibitors to the Thr-1 residues, which likely mimic the substrate-bound state of the active sites, dramatically increases the interaction between HslV and HslU. Significantly, MG132, unlike lactacystin or 4-hydroxy-5-iodo-3-nitrophenylacetyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-vinylsulfone (NLVS), could induce the interaction of HslV with HslU even in the absence of nucleotide or the sole presence of ADP. These findings provide a mechanism for the maintenance of stable HslVU complexes when substrates are bound to the Thr-1 active sites for the completion of a proteolytic cycle. Surprisingly, deletion of the Thr-1 residues was found to also cause a dramatic increase in the interaction between HslV and HslU in the absence of ATP. Collectively, our findings indicate that the N-terminal Thr active sites of HslV are involved in the communication between HslV and HslU in addition to its role in the catalysis of peptide bond cleavage. Materials—Enzymes for DNA cloning were purchased from Takara, New England Biolabs, and Stratagene. Carbobenzoxy-Gly-Gly-Leu-amidomethyl coumarin (Z-GGL-AMC) was purchased from Bachem. MG132, lactacystin, and NLVS were obtained from A. G. Scientific, Cayman Chemical, and Calbiochem, respectively. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Strains and Cloning—BW25113 ΔhslVU::kan strain was generated from BW25113 strain by using λRed system (25Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The deletion of hslVU operon was confirmed by PCR and immunoblot analysis. pBR-PL was constructed from pBR322 by substituting the HindIII-NruI segment of the vector with a polylinker (aa gct tAC TAG TTA CCG CGG TCG ACA TCC ATG GAG CTC GGG CCC cga; the lowercase indicates vector sequences). pV-1 expressing only HslV was generated by deleting the NruI-BglII segment of hslU gene in pGEM-T/HslVU vector. Site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) was performed to insert the His6 tag at the C terminus of HslV (SYKAHHHHHH; the HslV sequence is underlined), resulting in pVH-1 vector. Mutations in start codons and Thr-1 deletion were also generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Vectors for the production of mixed dodecamers consisting of HslV and Thr-1-deletion mutant (T1Δ) subunits (Table 1) were constructed by sequential insertions of hslV and t1Δ genes (restriction fragments of pV-1 or pVH-1) into the polylinker site of pBR-PL.TABLE 1Vector constructs used for in vivo generation of HslV mixed dodecamers The start codons used in the constructs were GTG in hslv, ATG in hslVa, TTG in hslVb, and GTG in t1Δ (see Fig. 5B).ConstructsGene 1Gene 2Gene 3ahslVahslVat1ΔbhslVat1ΔnonechslVat1Δnonedt1ΔhslVnoneet1Δt1ΔhslVft1Δt1ΔhslVb Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—HslU and HslV were purified as described previously (2Yoo S.J.

BL21 (DE3) ΔhslVU cells transformed with the vectors were cultured at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5–0.6 at 600 nm and then treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 30 min for protein induction. To express HslV mixed dodecamers, BW25113 ΔhslVU::kan cells harboring appropriate vectors were grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with ampicillin. Proteins were purified by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose columns according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen) with some modifications; i.e. imidazole was used at 50–60 mm for washing and at 450 mm for elution. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and stored at -70 °C for further uses. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NTA Pulldown Analysis—Reaction mixtures (0.5 ml) containing HslU (150 nm) and His-HslV (75 nm) in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.04% Triton X-100 were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in the absence or presence of 2 mm adenine nucleotides and 5 mm MgCl2. After incubation, the mixtures were supplemented with 10 μl of 1 m imidazole and 20 μl of Ni2+-NTA resins and rocked at 4 °C for 1 h. The resins were washed 4 times with 0.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 8) containing 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 60 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 0.04% Triton X-100, and 2 mm adenine nucleotides. Proteins bound to NTA resins were eluted by SDS sampling buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Assays—ATP hydrolysis was measured using an enzyme-coupled assay (26Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). HslU (0.2 μm) and HslV (0.2 μm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA were incubated at 37 °C with 2 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm NADH, 20 units/ml of pyruvate kinase, and 20 units/ml of lactic dehydrogenase. Absorbance at 340 nm was continuously recorded using a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec2000, GE Healthcare) equipped with a temperature controller. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the slope within a linear range, based on the extinction coefficient of NADH (ϵ340 nm = 6.22 × 103). Peptide hydrolysis was assayed by incubation of HslU (10 nm) and HslV (5 nm) in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) containing 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2 mm ATP with 0.1 mm Z-GGL-AMC at 37 °C (27Park E.

Fluorescence (λexcitation = 355 nm, λemission = 460 nm) of released AMC was continuously measured using a fluorometer (FluoStar, BMG) equipped with a temperature controller. The rate of peptide hydrolysis was then calculated from the slope within a linear range. Gel Filtration by Spin-column—Spin-columns were prepared by packing Sephadex G-25 (0.2 ml) in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes that have a hole at the tip of their bottoms. After equilibration with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) containing 100 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, they were loaded with HslV incubated with proteasome inhibitors, put in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun for 10 s. The samples eluted from the columns were then used for further analysis. Effects of Proteasome Inhibitors on the Interaction between HslV and HslU—To facilitate the purification of HslV and to assay the interaction between HslV and HslU by NTA pulldown analysis, poly-His (His6) was tagged to the C-terminal end of HslV. The resulting protein (referred to as HslV-His) was purified to apparent homogeneity and assayed for its ability to cleave Z-GGL-AMC in the presence of HslU. We also examined the ability of HslV-His to promote ATP hydrolysis by HslU. HslV-His cleaved the peptide and stimulated the ATP hydrolysis by HslU as well as HslV (Fig. 1A). In the presence of HslU and ATP, HslV-His could also degrade protein substrates, including α-casein and MBP-SulA as well as HslV (data not shown). These results indicate that the C-terminal His tag does not interfere with the interaction between HslV and HslU. HslV and HslU interact with each other (i.e. form the HslVU complex) in the presence of ATP, and this interaction is required for their mutual activation (1Rohrwild M. Coux O. Huang H.C.

In an attempt to determine how HslV allosterically activates HslU ATPase, we first monitored the interaction between HslV and HslU in the presence of each of three well known proteasome inhibitors: MG132, lactacystin, and NLVS. MG132 is known to reversibly react with the N-terminal Thr active sites of the 20 S proteasome β-subunits, whereas lactacystin and NLVS irreversibly modify them (22Sousa M.C. Kessler B.M. Overkleeft H.S. McKay D.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

HslV-His was incubated with each of the inhibitors in the absence or presence of adenine nucleotides. The samples were then subjected to NTA pulldown analysis. In the presence of ATP, all three inhibitors caused a dramatic increase in the amount of HslU co-precipitated with His-HslV as compared with DMSO that was used as a control (Fig. 1B, upper panel). Under the same experimental conditions, these inhibitors abolished the peptidase activity of HslV, indicating that they efficiently block the Thr-1 active sites of HslV (Fig. 1C, upper panel). These results demonstrate that the binding of proteasome inhibitors to the Thr-1 active sites leads to a marked increase in the interaction between HslV and HslU. Unexpectedly, MG132, but not lactacystin or NLVS, could increase the interaction of HslV-His with HslU even in the presence of ADP or the absence of any nucleotide. Thus, it appears that MG132 can bind to free HslV (i.e. HslV uncomplexed with HslU), and this binding induces tight interaction between HslV and HslU even in the absence of ATP. On the other hand, lactacystin and NLVS appear to bind only to HslV that is complexed with ATP-bound HslU, resulting in further stabilization of the HslVU complex. Taken together, these results suggest that the Thr-1 active sites of HslV protease are involved in the interaction between HslV and HslU. To determine whether MG132, unlike lactacystin and NLVS, could indeed bind to free HslV, each of the inhibitors was subjected to incubation with HslV-His alone followed by gel filtration to remove unbound inhibitors by using Sephadex G-25-filled spin-columns. Eluted HslV proteins were then subjected to incubation with HslU in the presence of ATP followed by NTA pulldown analysis. Gel filtration abrogated the stimulatory effect of lactacystin or NLVS on the interaction between HslV and HslU but showed little or no influence on that of MG132 (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Consistently, gel filtration abolished the inhibitory effects of lactacystin and NLVS on the peptidase activity of HslV but not that of MG132 (Fig. 1C, lower panel). These results indicate that MG132 binding to the Thr-1 active sites of free HslV is responsible for the induction of tight interaction between HslV and HslU in the absence of ATP or the presence of ADP. However, it remains unclear how MG132, unlike lactacystin and NLVS, can bind to free HslV. Although both MG132 and NLVS have the same tri-leucine peptide backbone, they have different N-terminal capping groups and C-terminal reactive groups. Therefore, one possibility is that, due to different steric or chemical properties of reactive groups, MG132, but not NLVS, is capable of reacting with or stably binding to the Thr-1 active sites of free HslV. However, this differential interaction of MG132 is not due to the reactive aldehyde group itself because N-acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde, a caspase-3 inhibitor, did not show any of the properties exhibited by MG132 (data not shown). Because lactacystin or NLVS promoted the interaction between HslV and HslU only when ATP was present, we examined whether the presence of ATP might be persistently required for maintaining the stable interaction of HslU with the inhibitor-bound HslV. HslV-His and HslU were incubated with ATP in the absence or presence of lactacystin or NLVS, and the HslVU complexes formed were pulled down by NTA resins. Precipitates were then extensively washed with buffers containing ATP, ADP, or none of the nucleotides followed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of the inhibitors, HslU was dissociated from HslVU complexes by washing with buffers containing ADP or no nucleotide (Fig. 1D). In their presence, however, HslU remained stably associated with HslV under all washing conditions tested, indicating that the stability of inhibitor-bound HslVU complex is no longer influenced by the presence or absence of any adenine nucleotide. These results also indicate that ATP-bound HslU is required for the initial step where the inhibitors bind to the Thr-1 residue of HslV, probably through a covalent modification of the hydroxyl group of the Thr-1 residue. This notion is consistent with previous reports that HslV requires association with ATP-bound HslU to allosterically activate the Thr-1 residue of HslV (15Huang H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21364-21372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Sousa M.C. Kessler B.M. Overkleeft H.S. McKay D.B. J. Mol.

Because HslV is known to stimulate the ATPase activity of HslU by 2–3-folds (Refs. 2Yoo S.J. Seol J.H. Shin D.H. Rohrwild M. Kang M.S. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1B) and because all three tested proteasome inhibitors markedly increase the interaction between HslV and HslU when ATP is present, we examined whether this increased interaction leads to a further enhancement of HslV-stimulated ATPase activity of HslU. All of the inhibitors dramatically enhanced the HslV-stimulated ATPase activity of HslU, although to different extents (Fig. 1E, left panel). In addition, removal of unbound inhibitors by gel filtration on spin-columns abolished the stimulatory effect of lactacystin or NLVS, not that of MG132, on ATP hydrolysis by HslU (Fig. 1E, right panel). These results again reveal that MG132 can bind to free HslV, and this binding induces tight association of HslV with HslU, resulting in a dramatic activation of HslU ATPase. Collectively, these results implicate a role of the Thr-1 active sites of HslV in the interaction between HslV and HslU and thereby in the control of HslU function. Effect of the Deletion of N-terminal Thr on the Interaction between HslV and HslU—To clarify the involvement of Thr-1 active sites in the interaction between HslV and HslU, we generated a HslV mutant lacking the Thr-1 residue, tagged poly-His to its C terminus, and purified by using NTA-agarose columns. Unexpectedly, the Thr-1-deletion mutant (referred to as T1Δ-His), unlike HslV-His, was co-purified with HslU from the NTA-agarose column (Fig. 2A) despite the buffer used for the affinity chromatography not being supplemented with ATP. These results indicate that, like MG132-bound HslV, T1Δ can form stable complexes with HslU even in the absence of ATP. To confirm this finding, T1Δ-His was purified to apparent homogeneity (i.e. separated from HslU) and then incubated with HslU in the absence or presence of ADP or ATP. NTA pulldown analysis reveals that HslU co-precipitates with T1Δ-His under all conditions tested (Fig. 2B), indicating that T1Δ interacts with HslU regardless of the binding of either adenine nucleotide to HslU. Moreover, the amount of HslU co-precipitated with T1Δ-His was much greater than that with HslV-His, indicating that the deletion of Thr-1 leads to a marked increase in the i"

Although a number of cells and tissues are capable of synthesizing complement components locally, the importance of such local synthesis in immune disease has been difficult to establish.We used bone marrow transplantation (BMT) between C3 knockout (C3KO) and wild type (WT) mice to construct animals that were discordant for systemic (hepatic) and local (monocytic) C3 synthetic capacity. An immune complex glomerulonephritis (GN) was then induced using intraperitoneal injections of horse spleen apoferritin (HSA) with a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) adjuvant. All HSA/LPS animals developed a proliferative GN with glomerular infiltration by monocytes. By sensitive ELISA, monocyte C3 synthesis could be detected in C3KO animals transplanted with WT bone marrow cells. Despite this, there were no significant differences among groups of mice in measures of clinical (proteinuria, renal function) or histologic (glomerular cellularity, crescents) disease severity.In this model of GN, local synthesis of C3 by infiltrating cells does not appear to be of pathologic importance."
