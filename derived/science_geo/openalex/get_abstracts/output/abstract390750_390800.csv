https://openalex.org/W2156568771,"The rising temperature of the world's oceans has become a major threat to coral reefs globally as the severity and frequency of mass coral bleaching and mortality events increase. In 2005, high ocean temperatures in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean resulted in the most severe bleaching event ever recorded in the basin.Satellite-based tools provided warnings for coral reef managers and scientists, guiding both the timing and location of researchers' field observations as anomalously warm conditions developed and spread across the greater Caribbean region from June to October 2005. Field surveys of bleaching and mortality exceeded prior efforts in detail and extent, and provided a new standard for documenting the effects of bleaching and for testing nowcast and forecast products. Collaborators from 22 countries undertook the most comprehensive documentation of basin-scale bleaching to date and found that over 80% of corals bleached and over 40% died at many sites. The most severe bleaching coincided with waters nearest a western Atlantic warm pool that was centered off the northern end of the Lesser Antilles.Thermal stress during the 2005 event exceeded any observed from the Caribbean in the prior 20 years, and regionally-averaged temperatures were the warmest in over 150 years. Comparison of satellite data against field surveys demonstrated a significant predictive relationship between accumulated heat stress (measured using NOAA Coral Reef Watch's Degree Heating Weeks) and bleaching intensity. This severe, widespread bleaching and mortality will undoubtedly have long-term consequences for reef ecosystems and suggests a troubled future for tropical marine ecosystems under a warming climate."
https://openalex.org/W2138557828,"Recent multi-dimensional approaches to the study of complex disease have revealed powerful insights into how genetic and epigenetic factors may underlie their aetiopathogenesis. We examined genotype-epigenotype interactions in the context of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), focussing on known regions of genomic susceptibility. We assayed DNA methylation in 60 females, stratified according to disease susceptibility haplotype using previously identified association loci. CpG methylation was assessed using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation on a targeted array (MeDIP-chip) and absolute methylation values were estimated using a Bayesian algorithm (BATMAN). Absolute methylation levels were quantified across LD blocks, and we identified increased DNA methylation on the FTO obesity susceptibility haplotype, tagged by the rs8050136 risk allele A (p = 9.40×10−4, permutation p = 1.0×10−3). Further analysis across the 46 kb LD block using sliding windows localised the most significant difference to be within a 7.7 kb region (p = 1.13×10−7). Sequence level analysis, followed by pyrosequencing validation, revealed that the methylation difference was driven by the co-ordinated phase of CpG-creating SNPs across the risk haplotype. This 7.7 kb region of haplotype-specific methylation (HSM), encapsulates a Highly Conserved Non-Coding Element (HCNE) that has previously been validated as a long-range enhancer, supported by the histone H3K4me1 enhancer signature. This study demonstrates that integration of Genome-Wide Association (GWA) SNP and epigenomic DNA methylation data can identify potential novel genotype-epigenotype interactions within disease-associated loci, thus providing a novel route to aid unravelling common complex diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2114733299,"Territorial subdivisions and geographic borders are essential for understanding phenomena in sociology, political science, history, and economics. They influence the interregional flow of information and cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology. However, it is unclear if existing administrative subdivisions that typically evolved decades ago still reflect the most plausible organizational structure of today. The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question. Based on a massive proxy dataset, we analyze a multi-scale human mobility network and compute effective geographic borders inherent to human mobility patterns in the United States. We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic. Finally, we introduce the concept of link significance that clarifies the observed structure of effective borders. Our approach represents a novel type of quantitative, comparative analysis framework for spatially embedded multi-scale interaction networks in general and may yield important insight into a multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity."

Furthermore, of the different PI3Ks, the class II isoforms were detected in β cells, although their role is still not well understood. Here we show that down-regulation of the class II PI3K isoform PI3K-C2α specifically impairs insulin granule exocytosis in rat insulinoma cells without affecting insulin content, the number of insulin granules at the plasma membrane, or the expression levels of key proteins involved in insulin secretion. Proteolysis of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa, a process involved in insulin granule exocytosis, is impaired in cells lacking PI3K-C2α. Finally, our data suggest that the mRNA for PI3K-C2α may be down-regulated in islets of Langerhans from type 2 diabetic compared with non-diabetic individuals. Our results reveal a critical role for PI3K-C2α in β cells and suggest that down-regulation of PI3K-C2α may be a feature of type 2 diabetes.

Intracellular signaling pathways regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are critical for the regulation of pancreatic β cell mass and survival. Eight mammalian PI3K isoforms exist, grouped into three classes, which generate lipid second messengers by phosphorylating position 3 within the inositol ring of distinct phosphoinositides (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4681) Google Scholar). The most studied pathway involves activation of class I isoforms, generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, and activation of the downstream effector protein kinase B/Akt, which plays a pivotal role in β cell regulation (2Leibiger I.B.

Although the importance of class I PI3Ks in the control of β cell mass and survival is well established, conflicting evidence exists in the literature about their role in insulin secretion. It has been reported that the classical PI3Ks inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 enhance insulin secretion in rat (5Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and mouse islets (6Zawalich W.S. Tesz G.J. Zawalich K.C. J.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and that wortmannin does not inhibit insulin secretion or synthesis (8Turner M.D. Arvan P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14025-14030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, knock-out mice for the class I isoform p110γ lack the first phase of insulin secretion (9MacDonald P.E. Joseph J.W. Yau D. Diao J. Asghar Z. Dai F. Oudit G.Y. Patel M.M. Backx P.H.

Rückle T. Woo M. Manning Fox J.E. MacDonald P.E. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2084-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recent evidence has revealed that PI3K isoforms other than the class I members are also present in pancreatic β cell. Specifically, the mRNAs for class II PI3Ks were detected in human pancreatic β cells (12Muller D. Huang G.C. Amiel S. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2835-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the percentage of β cells expressing the class II isoform PI3K-C2α mRNA was higher than any other PI3K analyzed (13Muller D. Huang G.C. Amiel S. Jones P.M. Persaud S.J. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 1239-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). More recently, protein expression of PI3K-C2α has been shown in human and mouse islets and in insulin-producing cell lines (14Leibiger B. Moede T. Uhles S. Barker C.J. Creveaux M. Domin J. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although less investigated than class I, the class II subfamily of PI3Ks is currently emerging as critical for several intracellular functions (15Falasca M. Maffucci T. Biochem. Soc Trans. 2007; 35: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Interest has been fuelled by our data demonstrating that class II PI3Ks generate a different lipid product in vivo, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P, 16Maffucci T. Cooke F.T. Foster F.M. Traer C.J. Fry M.J. Falasca M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Falasca M. Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R.

In particular, we demonstrated that PI3K-C2α generates a pool of PtdIns3P in muscle cells upon insulin stimulation (17Falasca M. Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R.

Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R. Shepherd P.R. James D.E. Maffucci T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28226-28236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These data indicate that PI3K-C2α regulates the exocytosis of GLUT4-containing vesicles and are consistent with the reported role of this enzyme in the regulated exocytosis of neurosecretory granules (18Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4841-4851Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the PI3K-C2α-dependent synthesis of PtdIns3P is critical for both GLUT4 translocation (17Falasca M. Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R. Shepherd P.R.

Acta. 2009; 1793: 1795-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and neurosecretory granule release (20Wen P.J. Osborne S.L. Morrow I.C. Parton R.G. Domin J. Meunier F.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that PI3K-C2α and its lipid product PtdIns3P may have a general role in exocytosis in different cellular contexts. The exocytosis of insulin is regulated by complex mechanisms (21Rutter G.A. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 247-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 22Rutter G.A. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 1861-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The main events in this process involve conversion of uptake glucose to glucose 6-phosphate by the enzyme β glucokinase, its metabolism, and a subsequent increase in the ATP/ADP ratio, which leads to the closure of the K+ATP channel, depolarization of the plasma membrane, and opening of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. Although other regulatory processes are also likely to be involved (23Henquin J.C. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 739-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), the resulting Ca2+ influx and rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration are key events that trigger insulin secretion. Indeed, any treatment able to induce closure of the K+ATP channel can increase intracellular Ca2+ levels and can trigger insulin secretion, even in the absence of glucose metabolism. In particular and relevant to this study, treatment of pancreatic β cells in vitro with high concentrations of KCl can induce insulin secretion through this mechanism, and therefore, allows investigation of the critical steps regulating insulin granule exocytosis irrespective of the glucose-mediated effect (metabolic component). For the hormone to be released, the insulin-containing granules must dock to the plasma membrane and be “primed” (i.e. they must become competent for release through chemical modifications) before the actual fusion of the granules can occur (24Rorsman P. Renström E. Diabetologia. 2003; 46: 1029-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Fusion of the granules involves a complex interaction between the molecules synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), syntaxin 1 at the plasma membrane, and the vesicle-associated membrane protein VAMP2, probably modulated by synaptotagmin V (25Iezzi M. Kouri G. Fukuda M. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and VII (26Gauthier B.R. Duhamel D.L. Iezzi M. Theander S. Saltel F. Fukuda M. Wehrle-Haller B. Wollheim C.B. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a complex of these three proteins anchors the granule to the membrane under resting conditions. Upon stimulation, SNAP25 proteolysis allows fusion of the granules and subsequent insulin release (27Marshall C. Hitman G.A. Partridge C.J. Clark A. Ma H. Shearer T.R. Turner M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In particular, proteolysis of SNAP25 seems to be critical for insulin secretion (27Marshall C. Hitman G.A. Partridge C.J. Clark A. Ma H. Shearer T.R. Turner M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recent data have indicated a role for PI3K-C2α in glucose-induced insulin secretion in a mechanism involving an insulin-dependent feedback loop (14Leibiger B. Moede T. Uhles S. Barker C.J. Creveaux M. Domin J. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), implying that this enzyme is involved in the metabolic regulation of insulin secretion. The aim of this work was to determine whether PI3K-C2α had also a direct role in the late steps of insulin granule exocytosis (i.e. docking, priming, fusion). Here we report that selective down-regulation of this PI3K isoform in INS1 rat insulinoma cells specifically impairs insulin secretion irrespective of the metabolic effect, without affecting insulin content or the number of insulin granules associated with the plasma membrane in resting cells. Down-regulation of PI3K-C2α does not affect the expression levels of key proteins involved in insulin secretion, whereas it reduces the proteolysis of SNAP25, suggesting a role for this enzyme in fusion of the insulin granules to the membrane. Data further suggest that the mRNA for PI3K-C2α may be selectively down-regulated in islets of Langerhans from type 2 diabetic compared with non diabetic individuals, suggesting that down-regulation of PI3K-C2α may be a feature of type 2 diabetes.

The insulin receptor inhibitor AG1024 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). “Scrambled” siRNA (Silencer® negative control siRNA) was from Ambion (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Specific siRNAs targeting PI3K-C2α were designed based on the same sequences used to generate the stable cell lines (sequence 1, GTCCAGTCACAGTGCAAAG; sequence 2, GTACAGAATGAGGAGGTGG) and obtained from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). INS1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Stable cell lines were generated by retroviral infection using recombinant vectors as described (17Falasca M. Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R. Shepherd P.R.

Alternatively, cells were transfected with the specific siRNAs (or scrambled siRNAs as control) using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) and stimulated for insulin secretion 72h after transfection. Cell proliferation was determined by manual counting. For flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle profile, cells were washed once in PBS and incubated for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mg/ml propidium iodide before analysis on a BD Biosciences LSR II analyzer. Cells were treated with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB in the absence of Ca2+) or stimulated with KRB containing a secretagogue mixture (13.5 mm glucose, 10 mm leucine, 10 mm glutamine, 1 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm tolbutamide, 1 mm Ca2+) for 3 h. Alternatively, cells were stimulated with 60 mm KCl or 20 mm glucose (in KRB supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+) for 30 min. Supernatants were collected, and total released insulin was determined using the Mercodia high range rat insulin ELISA kit (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed as described below. Protein concentration was determined in each sample using Bradford reagent. Alternatively, cells were detached and counted. Total released insulin was normalized by the total protein content or the total number of cells. In the experiments using the insulin receptor inhibitor, cells were treated for 30 min with KRB containing the indicated concentration of AG1024 (or vehicle) and then treated with 60 mm KCl in the absence or presence of AG1024 for further 30 min. Cells were resuspended in PBS and incubated with 500 μl of extraction solution (15% HCl, 80% ethanol) at 4 °C. After 24 h, 500 μl of 1 m NaOH was added to neutralize the samples, and insulin content was assayed as above. Total protein content was used to normalize insulin content. Alternatively, insulin content was measured by radioimmunoassay and normalized by the total number of cells. Cells were seeded on Lab-TekTM chambered #1.0 borosilicate coverglass (Nunc GmbH & Co. KG, Langenselbold, Germany) for confocal live microscopy and incubated with 250 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5% BSA, 2 mm CaCl2,4 μm Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5% BSA, 2 mm CaCl2, and incubated at 37 °C in KRB containing 1 mm Ca2+ for 30 min to allow de-esterification of Fluo-4. Samples were analyzed using the Zeiss confocal microscope LSM 510 equipped with a chamber for live imaging at 37 °C supplied with 5% CO2 using a 10× objective. After recording basal fluorescence, cells were stimulated with 60 mm KCl (in KRB containing 1 mm Ca2+). ZEN Carl Zeiss software was used for acquisition and analysis of raw data. Fluorescence values of 40 cells per chamber were analyzed and expressed as the mean of fluorescence. For immunoprecipitation studies, cells were treated with KRB for 30 min before a further 30-min stimulation with 60 mm KCl or 100 nm insulin (in KRB supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+). Alternatively, cells were treated for 3 h with the secretagogue mixture. After washing in ice-cold PBS, cells were scraped in lysis buffer (containing 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors cocktails (Sigma). Five hundred micrograms of proteins were immunoprecipitated using the Catch and Release® kit (Millipore UK Ltd, Walford, UK) and 2 μg of anti-IRS2 (1:100 of the stock, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For analysis of Akt activation, cells were treated with KRB for 3 h before a 30-min stimulation with 60 mm KCl (in KRB supplemented with 1 mm Ca2+) or with serum-free RPMI containing either 0.5 mm glucose, 15 mm glucose and 10 ng/ml insulin-like growth factor 1, or 15 mm glucose and 100 nm insulin. Alternatively, cells were treated for 3 h with the secretagogue mixture. Cells were then lysed as above, and Akt activation was monitored by analyzing phosphorylation at its residues Ser-473 and Thr-308 (phospho-Ser-473 Akt from Cell Signaling 1:500; phospho-Thr-308 Akt from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 1:1000). Equal loading was assessed using an anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). Cells plated on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA for further 30 min. Coverslips were then incubated with the specific primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature (dilution 1:50 for all of them), washed in PBS, and further incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 microscope with a Meta detector. TIRF microscopy (28Axelrod D. J.

Briefly, cells were infected with NPY-Venus-expressing adenovirus 48 h before imaging at 32 °C in modified KRB (140 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm NaHCO3 saturated with O2/CO2 and pH 7.4) with 0.1% BSA and 3 mm glucose using a custom-built lens-type TIRF microscope based on an inverted stand (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss) and equipped with a 100×/1.45 Apo lens (Carl Zeiss). Cells were excited with a DPSS laser (473 nm, 80 milliwatt; Crystalasers). Images were captured on a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (iXonEM + DU-897, and IQ software Andor Technology, Belfast, UK) as an average of four 50-ms exposures. Cells were selected based on yellow fluorescence and morphology. Granules were detected automatically using ImageJ software with the particle detector plugin. A threshold was set by the operator once for the entire data set. Data are expressed as the number of granules/μm2 of the visible cell “footprint.” Primers for real-time PCR analysis were designed using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems) using mRNA sequences for rat on the Ensembl data base. Sequence specificity for all primers was verified using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Real time-PCR was performed on an ABI-Prism Fast 7500 device (Applied Biosystems) using powerSYBR reagent (Applied Biosystems).

For microarray studies, total RNA was extracted and treated as reported elsewhere (34Bugliani M. Masini M. Liechti R. Marselli L. Xenarios I. Boggi U. Filipponi F. Masiello P. Marchetti P. Islets. 2009; 1: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, after two-cycle amplification, RNA was biotinylated, fragmented, and hybridized onto HG-U133A Affymetrix chips. These were then scanned and normalized, and differential gene expression was assessed. Genes with a p value lower than 0.01 were considered as differentially expressed. The row data have been deposited in a MIAME compliant data base (GEO, accession number GSE25724). For qPCR, 1 μg of total RNA was extracted from human islets from 13 non-diabetic and 6 type 2 diabetic individuals (as above) and reverse-transcribed with iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) before analysis using the Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-time PCR system. The cDNA was amplified using Maxima SYBR (Fermentas, Sheriff Hutton, UK) according to the manufacturer's protocol using primers (Invitrogen) for PI3K-C2α (forward, 5′-tggaaaatccctttctgtgg; reverse, 5′-aaaaagctgccatctcctca) and actin (forward, 5′-agaaaatctggcaccacacc; reverse, 5′- ggggtgttgaaggtctcaaa), which was used as reference gene. All primer pairs were tested for specificity and efficiency. Recent data have revealed a role for PI3K-C2α in glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells and suggested that this enzyme is important for the regulation of the metabolic component of insulin secretion (14Leibiger B. Moede T. Uhles S. Barker C.J. Creveaux M. Domin J. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However previous data, including data from our own laboratory, have suggested that PI3K-C2α (and its lipid product PtdIns3P) can regulate late steps in the process of exocytosis (17Falasca M. Hughes W.E. Dominguez V. Sala G. Fostira F. Fang M.Q. Cazzolli R. Shepherd P.R. James D.E. Maffucci T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28226-28236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Meunier F.A. Osborne S.L. Hammond G.R. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Domin J. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2008; 19: 5593-5603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We, therefore, decided to investigate whether PI3K-C2α may also play a role in insulin secretion by regulating the final steps of insulin granule exocytosis (i.e. docking, priming, fusion of the granules). Because no specific PI3K-C2α inhibitors are currently available, we generated two stable rat insulinoma INS1 cell lines expressing recombinant vectors containing distinct shRNAs targeting the enzyme. A vector containing a scrambled shRNA was used to generate control (“sh scrambled”) cells. Both shRNAs were able to down-regulate PI3K-C2α expression levels (Fig. 1, A and B) with no effect on the levels of other PI3Ks (Fig. 1B). No difference in proliferation was observed when cells were cultured in complete medium (Fig. 1C), and only a slight increase in the sub-G1 population was observed in cells lacking PI3K-C2α (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that PI3K-C2α does not regulate cell proliferation and survival in pancreatic β cells under the experimental conditions used here. To investigate the potential role of PI3K-C2α in the final steps of insulin granule exocytosis, we stimulated cells with a secretagogue mixture able to induce maximal insulin granule exocytosis. Under these experimental conditions, we observed that treatment of INS1 cells with classical PI3K inhibitors did not reduce insulin secretion (Fig. 2A). Because PI3K-C2α is the only PI3K isoform resistant to treatment with both inhibitors (35Domin J. Pages F. Volinia S. Rittenhouse S.E. Zvelebil M.J. Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), these data suggested a potential involvement of PI3K-C2α in this process. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed that down-regulation of PI3K-C2α strongly reduced the total amount of insulin secreted upon cellular stimulation in both PI3K-C2α knockdown cell lines (Fig. 2, B and C). No difference in insulin secretion was observed between parental and control sh scrambled cells (Fig. 2, B and C), ruling out nonspecific effects of shRNA expression or of retroviral infection. Similar data were obtained in the stable cell lines when insulin secretion was stimulated by treatment with KCl (Fig. 3A; supplemental Fig. S1A). Consistent with recent reported evidence (14Leibiger B. Moede T. Uhles S. Barker C.J. Creveaux M. Domin J. Berggren P.O. Leibiger I.B. FASEB J. 2010; 24: 1824-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), significant inhibition of glucose-dependent insulin secretion was also detected in INS1 lacking PI3K-C2α (supplemental Fig. S1B). To rule out potential secondary effects due to chronic down-regulation of PI3K-C2α, insulin secretion induced by KCl stimulation was analyzed in cells upon transient down-regulation of the enzyme using siRNAs (Fig. 3B). A clear inhibition of KCl-induced insulin secretion was detected in cells transfected with two specific siRNAs targeting PI3K-C2α compared with cells expressing a control scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these data indicate that PI3K-C2α specifically regulates secretion of insulin granules.FIGURE 3Effect of PI3K-C2α down-regulation on insulin secretion induced by treatment with KCl.

https://openalex.org/W2013333878,"Leukocyte-like cells called hemocytes have key functions in Drosophila innate immunity. Three hemocyte types occur: plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes. In the absence of qimmune challenge, plasmatocytes are the predominant hemocyte type detected, while crystal cells and lamellocytes are rare. However, upon infestation by parasitic wasps, or in melanotic mutant strains, large numbers of lamellocytes differentiate and encapsulate material recognized as “non-self”. Current models speculate that lamellocytes, plasmatocytes and crystal cells are distinct lineages that arise from a common prohemocyte progenitor. We show here that over-expression of the CoREST-interacting transcription factor Chn in plasmatocytes induces lamellocyte differentiation, both in circulation and in lymph glands. Lamellocyte increases are accompanied by the extinction of plasmatocyte markers suggesting that plasmatocytes are transformed into lamellocytes. Consistent with this, timed induction of Chn over-expression induces rapid lamellocyte differentiation within 18 hours. We detect double-positive intermediates between plasmatocytes and lamellocytes, and show that isolated plasmatocytes can be triggered to differentiate into lamellocytes in vitro, either in response to Chn over-expression, or following activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Finally, we have marked plasmatocytes and show by lineage tracing that these differentiate into lamellocytes in response to the Drosophila parasite model Leptopilina boulardi. Taken together, our data suggest that lamellocytes arise from plasmatocytes and that plasmatocytes may be inherently plastic, possessing the ability to differentiate further into lamellocytes upon appropriate challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2084415461,"20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and its receptor complex ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (USP) play a crucial role in controlling development, metamorphosis, reproduction and diapause. The ligand-receptor complex 20E-EcR/USP directly activates a small set of early-response genes and a much larger set of late-response genes. However, ecdysone-responsive genes have not been previously characterized in the context of insect chitin biosynthesis.Here, we show that injection-based RNA interference (RNAi) directed towards a common region of the two isoforms of SeEcR in a lepidopteron insect Spodoptera exigua was effective, with phenotypes including a high mortality prior to pupation and developmental defects. After gene specific RNAi, chitin contents in the cuticle of an abnormal larva significantly decreased. The expression levels of five genes in the chitin biosynthesis pathway, SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP, SeCHSA and SeCHSB, were significantly reduced, while there was no difference in the expression of SeTre-2 prior to 72 hr after injection of EcR dsRNA. Meanwhile, injection of 20E in vivo induced the expression of the five genes mentioned above. Moreover, the SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB genes showed late responses to the hormone and the induction of SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB genes by 20E were able to be inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in vitro indicating these genes are 20E late-response genes.We conclude that SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB in the chitin biosynthesis pathway are 20E late-response genes and 20E and its specific receptors plays a key role in the regulation of chitin biosynthesis via inducing their expression."
https://openalex.org/W2082929666,"Expansion of a GAA·TTC repeat in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene causes an mRNA deficit that results in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA). The region flanking the repeat on FRDA alleles is associated with more extensive DNA methylation than is seen on normal alleles and histone modifications typical of repressed genes. However, whether these changes are responsible for the mRNA deficit is controversial. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and cell lines from affected and unaffected individuals, we show that certain marks of active chromatin are also reduced in the promoter region of the FXN gene in patient cells. Thus, the promoter chromatin may be less permissive for transcription initiation than it is on normal alleles. Furthermore, we show that the initiating form of RNA polymerase II and histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 4, a chromatin mark tightly linked to transcription initiation, are both present at lower levels on FRDA alleles. In addition, a mark of transcription elongation, trimethylated H3K36, shows a reduced rate of accumulation downstream of the repeat. Our data thus suggest that repeat expansion reduces both transcription initiation and elongation in FRDA cells. Our findings may have implications for understanding the mechanism responsible for FRDA as well as for therapeutic approaches to reverse the transcription deficit.

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), 3The abbreviations used are: FRDA, Friedreich ataxia; RNAPII, RNA polymerase II; TSS, transcription start site. an autosomal recessive disorder with early onset, is the most common inherited ataxia (1Pandolfo M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 516: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to ataxia, diabetes and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are also commonly seen, with congestive heart failure being a frequent cause of early mortality. The disorder results from mutations in the frataxin (FXN) gene. Most affected individuals have large expansions of a GAA·TTC repeat in intron 1 of both FXN alleles (1Pandolfo M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 516: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expanded alleles produce lower than normal amounts of FXN mRNA, resulting in a deficiency of frataxin, a protein essential for mitochondrial iron metabolism (1Pandolfo M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2002; 516: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In general, the repeat number is directly related to the age of onset and the severity of symptoms (2Montermini L. Richter A. Morgan K. Justice C.M. Julien D. Castellotti B. Mercier J. Poirier J. Capozzoli F. Bouchard J.P. Lemieux B. Mathieu J. Vanasse M. Seni M.H. Graham G. Andermann F. Andermann E. Melançon S.B.

Brain, peripheral blood leukocytes, and lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with FRDA all show a similar FXN mRNA deficit, and the region flanking the repeat in these cells is aberrantly methylated and enriched for histone modifications characteristic of genes that are transcriptionally repressed (3Herman D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6056-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because the repeat is relatively close to the promoter, the repeat-mediated chromatin changes could affect transcription initiation if they were to spread to the promoter. This could produce a promoter chromatin configuration that was less permissive for transcription initiation (8Lorincz M.C. Dickerson D.R. Schmitt M. Groudine M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Because intragenic DNA methylation can reduce transcription elongation (8Lorincz M.C. Dickerson D.R. Schmitt M. Groudine M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), repeat expansion may also affect the ability of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to transcribe through the intron. An alternative explanation for the FXN mRNA deficit in FRDA has been suggested based on the observation that long GAA·TTC repeats block transcription elongation on unchromatinized templates in vitro or when propagated in bacteria (9Grabczyk E. Usdin K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2815-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Sakamoto N. Chastain P.D. Parniewski P. Ohshima K. Pandolfo M. Griffith J.D. Wells R.D. Mol.

Genet. 1998; 62: 111-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been attributed to the ability of these repeats to form triple-stranded DNA structures during transcription that trap RNA polymerase on the template. Should this mechanism operate at the FXN locus in FRDA cells, the major effect would presumably be downstream of transcription initiation. To better understand how repeat expansion affects transcription, we have extended our previous chromatin immunoprecipitation studies on affected and unaffected alleles to include a variety of additional marks of active chromatin and of the initiating form of RNAPII. Our data suggest that problems with both transcription initiation and elongation contribute significantly to the FXN mRNA deficit responsible for FRDA pathology. Our data provide clues to the molecular basis of repeat-mediated disease pathology in FRDA as well as a clear rationale for the use of chromatin-modifying agents in the treatment of this disorder. Lymphoblasts from individuals without FRDA (GM06895, GM06865, and GM06906) and those with FRDA (GM04079, GM15850, GM16207, GM16209, and GM16243) were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ). The repeat numbers in these patient cell lines are 340/420, 650/1030, 280/830, 800/800, and 670/1170, respectively. Lymphoblasts were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic under standard conditions (Invitrogen). The following antibodies (catalogue numbers given in parentheses) were purchased: H4K5Ac (07-327), H3K4Me2 (07-030), H3K9Ac (07-352), H3K9Me2 (07-441), H3K4Me3 (04-745), and normal rabbit IgG (12-370) from Millipore (Temecula, CA), antibody to RPB1 subunit of yeast RNA polymerase II (8WG16 clone) (W0011) from NeoClone Biotechnology, and anti-H4K16Ac (39167) from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA).

Reverse transcription with either random hexamers or strand-specific primers was done on DNase I-treated RNA using SuperScript III first strand synthesis kit from Invitrogen as per the manufacturer's recommendation. Strand-specific primers were used that contained a linker sequence at the exon 1 and exon 2 as described previously (13Filippova G.N. Thienes C.P. Penn B.H. Cho D.H. Hu Y.J. Moore J.M. Klesert T.R. Lobanenkov V.V. Tapscott S.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was then done with Power SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using a primer homologous to the linker sequence and exon-specific primers. PCR with RNA that had not been reverse-transcribed produced no product, demonstrating that the PCR product obtained using this strategy was not due to contaminating DNA. Primer sequences are listed in Table 1. The ChIP assay kit from Millipore was used for histone ChIPs according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications as described previously (14Biacsi R. Kumari D. Usdin K. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000017Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For RNAPII ChIP assays, modified wash steps were used: 1× with low salt wash buffer (Millipore) for 5 min, 1× with wash buffer II (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) for 3 min, 1× with wash buffer III (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.5% IGEPAL-CA630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) for 3 min followed by two washes with Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, for 5 min each. The amount of FXN DNA immunoprecipitated was determined using quantitative real-time PCR, a Power SYBR Green PCR master mix, and primers specific for different regions of the gene (Table 1). The immunoprecipitated material was normalized to 5% of input and expressed relative to GAPDH. For RNAPII ChIPs, the background at MyoD was subtracted from the final values. The ChIP experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and each PCR reaction was done in triplicate. Student's t test was used to calculate the p values (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). To study the extent of the repeat-mediated chromatin changes on FRDA alleles, we examined a number of marks typical of active chromatin in three regions of the FXN gene in cells from unaffected individuals and those with FRDA. These regions comprise a promoter segment located immediately upstream of a previously identified transcription start site (TSS), referred to as TSS1 (15Campuzano V. Montermini L. Moltò M.D. Pianese L. Cossée M. Cavalcanti F. Monros E. Rodius F. Duclos F. Monticelli A. Zara F. Cañizares J. Koutnikova H. Bidichandani S.I. Gellera C. Brice A. Trouillas P. De Michele G. Filla A.

Science. 1996; 271: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar), and the previously described Up GAA and Down GAA regions that flank the FRDA repeat (3Herman D. Jenssen K. Burnett R. Soragni E. Perlman S.L. Gottesfeld J.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 1A. We found that in addition to reduced levels of marks of active chromatin in the region immediately flanking the GAA·TTC repeats, some of these marks were also reduced in the promoter region of FRDA alleles. Specifically, in four patient cell lines, all five marks of active chromatin examined, H4K5Ac, H4K16Ac, H3K9Ac, H3K14Ac, and H3K4Me2, were significantly lower in the Up GAA and Down GAA regions than in cells from unaffected individuals (Fig. 1). Furthermore, although no differences were seen in the levels of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac in the promoter region, levels of H4K16Ac, H4K5Ac, and H3K4Me2 were significantly lower on patient alleles. Notably, although the difference between the levels of these chromatin marks in unaffected and affected cells was much less than in the regions flanking the repeat (2–3-fold as compared with 8–10-fold), the differences were still significant. Because our finding of altered chromatin in the promoter region in lymphoblastoid cells is different from previously published reports (3Herman D. Jenssen K. Burnett R. Soragni E. Perlman S.L. Gottesfeld J.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Punga T. Bühler M. EMBO Mol. Med. 2010; 2: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we tested two additional cell lines from individuals without FRDA, GM06895 and GM06906, to assess whether these differences could be attributed to variation in the levels of these marks on unaffected alleles. Although the absolute level of each histone modification did differ in each of these cell lines, the same trend was found for all the chromatin marks tested (data not shown). The reduced levels of marks of active chromatin seen on the promoter would be consistent with the recent finding that the FXN promoter in the brains of two individuals with FRDA was enriched for two repressive chromatin marks, H3K9Me2 and H3K9Me3 (5Al-Mahdawi S. Pinto R.M. Ismail O. Varshney D. Lymperi S. Sandi C. Trabzuni D. Pook M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and that fibroblasts from two different FRDA individuals also show enrichment for H3K9Me2 and another repressive chromatin mark, H3K27Me3, in a region slightly closer to the frataxin open reading frame (ORF) than the region we examined (17De Biase I. Chutake Y.K. Rindler P.M. Bidichandani S.I. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the repeat-mediated chromatin changes seen in intron 1 do extend into the promoter. Thus, in principle, repeat expansion could contribute to the FXN mRNA deficit in FRDA cells via an effect on transcription initiation. In addition to TSS1, which was defined on the basis of a clone isolated from a 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiment (15Campuzano V. Montermini L. Moltò M.D. Pianese L. Cossée M.

Given that some chromatin marks have a restricted distribution with respect to the TSS, we carried out primer extension on RNA isolated from normal and patient cells using a primer within the open reading frame to define the major TSS in lymphoblastoid cells. Very long exposures of the gel-resolved primer extension products showed no detectable bands in the region of TSS1. Instead, a single product terminating 159 bases downstream of TSS1 was the major product seen. We refer to this putative TSS, which is 62 bp upstream of the ORF, as TSS2 (Fig. 2, left panel). Thus, the most prevalent transcript from the FXN gene originates closer to the ORF than TSS1, at least in lymphoblastoid cells. The same putative TSS was seen in both unaffected and affected individuals. In contrast to what is seen in most mammalian promoters, TSS2 was not associated with either a TATAA box (19Mishina M. Kurosaki T. Yamamoto T. Notake M. Masu M. Numa S. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20Sassone-Corsi P. Corden J. Kédinger C. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3941-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or an Initiator (Inr) element (21Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Further support for the idea that transcription initiates closer to the ORF can be seen in the distribution of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4Me3) on normal alleles. Although H3K4Me2 has a broad distribution within active genes, H3K4Me3 levels are highest immediately downstream of transcription initiation (22Barski A. Cuddapah S. Cui K. Roh T.Y. Schones D.E.

As can be seen in Fig. 3A, when a primer pair from the TSS1 region was used to interrogate chromatin immunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to H3K4Me3, the levels of this mark were much lower than what is seen when a primer pair within the open reading frame, close to TSS2, is used. This supports the idea that TSS2 is closer to the start of transcription than TSS1. Because H3K4Me3 deposition is directly related to the activity of the initiating form of RNAPII, its levels are thought to more clearly reflect the extent of transcription initiation than some other chromatin modifications (25Lee J.H. Skalnik D.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Lee J.H. Tate C.M. You J.S. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 7337-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The levels of H3K4Me3 on patient alleles were ∼50% of that seen on the unaffected controls. Given that these patient cells have FXN mRNA levels that are 20–30% of that of unaffected individuals (Fig. 3B), the reduced level of H3K4Me3 suggests that a transcription initiation problem may account for a large proportion of the FXN mRNA deficit in FRDA. To confirm that transcription initiation is indeed impaired on FRDA alleles, we determined the enrichment of TSS1 and TSS2 on the affected and unaffected alleles with two different antibodies to RNAPII. The first antibody we tested is specific to RNAPII phosphorylated on serine 5 (Ser(P)-5), the initiating form of RNAPII (29Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). As can be seen from Fig. 3C, levels of this form of RNAPII are higher on the promoter and exon 1 regions tested than the Up GAA region. This was true of both affected and unaffected cells. However, FRDA cells showed ∼50% less enrichment for the form of RNAPII detected by this antibody, consistent with the H3K4Me3 data and the idea that initiation occurs less frequently on FRDA alleles. Further support for an effect on transcription initiation was obtained with 8WG16, an antibody to a subunit of yeast RNAPII (30Hirakata M. Okano Y. Pati U. Suwa A. Medsger Jr., T.A. Hardin J.A. Craft J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2665-2672Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes a more complex array of human RNAPII isoforms than the first antibody, including those phosphorylated at Ser-5. As with the first RNAPII antibody, we saw strong enrichment for the epitopes recognized by the 8WG16 antibody in exon 1 on unaffected alleles with ∼50% less enrichment being seen on FRDA alleles (Fig. 3D). The distribution of 8WG16 epitopes was narrower than those detected with the Ser(P)-5 antibody with significantly more enrichment being seen in the TSS2 region than the TSS1 region. To assess the contribution of a block to transcription elongation to the mRNA deficit in FRDA, we first looked for evidence of a transcript that was truncated in the vicinity of the repeat by comparing the levels of exon 1 and exon 2 in both affected and unaffected individuals. To avoid any potential contribution from the antisense transcript produced from the FXN locus (17De Biase I. Chutake Y.K. Rindler P.M. Bidichandani S.I. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we used strand-specific RT-PCR to examine the levels of FXN mRNA specific to exon 1 and exon 2 in unaffected and FRDA cells. When a primer pair located downstream of TSS2 was used to compare the levels of exon 1 using quantitative PCR, a 4–5-fold higher product yield was seen in unaffected individuals as compared with individuals with FRDA (Fig. 4, upper panel). This was comparable with the difference in total FXN mRNA seen with primers from exons 3 and 4 (Fig. 3B). The levels of exon 2 were also 4–5 times higher in unaffected cells (Fig. 4, lower panel). Thus, no patient-specific decline in exon 2 levels relative to those of exon 1 was detected. However, it was apparent that the absolute yield of PCR product from exon 2 was 3–4-fold lower than that of exon 1 in both affected and unaffected cells despite the very similar efficiency of amplification seen when DNA was used as a template. Thus, it may be that transcription termination occurs frequently on both normal and patient alleles in the region downstream of the exon 1 primer pair. Because a truncated transcript might be unstable, we used a second approach to assess an effect of the repeats on transcription elongation. We first tested antibodies to RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser-2, the elongating form of RNAPII. Unfortunately, although enrichment was seen on a highly transcribed gene (GAPDH), we did not get a good enrichment on the FXN locus even on normal alleles due, perhaps in part, to the low transcription rate of the gene. However, trimethylation of H3K36 occurs co-transcriptionally in a manner dependent on the level of elongating RNAPII (31Krogan N.J. Kim M. Tong A. Golshani A. Cagney G. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Beattie B.K. Emili A. Boone C. Shilatifard A. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 4207-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Thus, this histone modification is considered a reasonable proxy measure of the amount of elongation. We found that H3K36Me3 levels rose more slowly in FRDA cells than they did in cells from unaffected individuals, with no significant accumulation of H3K36Me3 on FRDA alleles (Fig. 5). In particular, there were much lower levels of H3K36Me3 on the Down GAA region relative to the Up GAA region that could be consistent with a repeat-mediated effect on transcription elongation. The data in this study provide information relevant to both the normal functioning of the FXN gene and the aberrant expression from FRDA alleles. We have shown, using a combination of primer extension to map the 5′ end of the transcript and chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies to proteins that are enriched close to the start of transcription, that the major TSS (TSS2) on the normal FXN gene is located closer to the frataxin ORF than previously appreciated, at least in lymphoblastoid cells. This finding is consistent with our previous work using reporter assays in muscle cells (32Greene E. Entezam A. Kumari D. Usdin K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), in which we showed that there was significant promoter activity located in the sequences downstream of TSS1. This work showed that the most important regions for the positive regulation of the FXN promoter in muscle cells are located between −221 and −121 bases upstream of the start of the frataxin ORF (Fig. 2, right panel, bracketed sequence). This is the only significant region of homology between primates and rodents and represents the ancient remnant of an L2-like element, a family of long interspersed repeated DNA elements (32Greene E. Entezam A. Kumari D. Usdin K. Genomics. 2005; 85: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the major TSS in both lymphoblastoid and muscle cells lies closer to the frataxin ORF than previously appreciated. Examination of the region in the vicinity of TSS2 suggests that, unlike TSS1 that colocalizes with an Initiator (Inr)-like element, TSS2 is not associated with TATA-like or Initiator elements, motifs typical of most mammalian promoters. Our identification of this TSS should help facilitate a better understanding of the factors important for the optimal expression from this unusual promoter. In addition, our observation of the higher yield of exon 1 relative to exon 2 in both normal and patient cells (Fig. 4) suggests that transcription frequently terminates downstream of exon 1 even in normal cells. Because normal cells contain a GAA·TTC repeat tract that is far too short to cause triplex DNA or Sticky DNA formation, a repeat-mediated basis for this transcription termination seems unlikely. Because intragenic methylation can affect transcription elongation (8Lorincz M.C. Dickerson D.R. Schmitt M. Groudine M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), the elongation problem seen in cells from unaffected individuals may be related to the DNA methylation present in the region upstream of the FRDA repeat even on normal alleles (4Greene E. Mahishi L. Entezam A. Kumari D. Usdin K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3383-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An alternative explanation for this termination is suggested by the broader distribution of epitopes that are recognized by antibodies to RNAPII phosphorylated at Ser-5 as compared with the 8WG16 antibody (Fig. 3). This phenomenon has been attributed to an isoform of RNAPII that carries, in addition to the Ser-5 modification, other modifications that prevent recognition by 8WG16 (33Brookes E. Pombo A. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Such an RNAPII isoform is often seen on inducible genes and would be consistent with the observation that iron is a positive regulator of FXN expression (34Li K. Besse E.K. Ha D. Kovtunovych G. Rouault T.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2008; 17: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because such genes often generate transcripts that terminate near the first exon junction (35Stock J.K. Giadrossi S. Casanova M. Brookes E. Vidal M. Koseki H. Brockdorff N. Fisher A.G. Pombo A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1428-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the high frequency of premature transcription termination on both normal and FRDA alleles may be related to some conserved property of this class of genes. The promoters of normal and FRDA alleles show differences in the extent of their enrichment for marks of transcriptionally permissive chromatin. Specifically, FRDA promoters are associated with reduced levels of H4K5Ac and H4K16Ac but not H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac. Because H3 acetylation is thought to occur co-transcriptionally, it is unclear what significance these modifications have upstream of transcription. On the other hand, acetylation of H4 is thought to precede transcription. Thus, the reduced H4 acetylation on the FRDA promoter likely reflects a chromatin configuration that is less permissive for transcription (36Rybtsova N. Leimgruber E. Seguin-Estévez Q. Dunand-Sauthier I. Krawczyk M. Reith W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In particular, H4K16 acetylation is thought to play an important role in maintaining an open chromatin configuration (37Shogren-Knaak M. Ishii H. Sun J.M. Pazin M.J. Davie J.R. Peterson C.L. Science. 2006; 311: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). We also found that FRDA alleles were associated with reduced levels of RNAPII that is recognized by an antibody that is specific for the isoform phosphorylated at Ser-5. This result is at odds with data published while this work was in progress in which cells from an affected individual and his unaffected sibling showed no significant difference in the region of TSS1 in the amount of DNA immunoprecipitated with the same antibody (16Punga T. Bühler M. EMBO Mol. Med. 2010; 2: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A number of explanations for this difference are possible including the fact that maximal enrichment for this form of RNAPII is seen in the vicinity of TSS2, and although we always find a significant difference between affected and unaffected alleles at TSS2, the difference is not always significant at TSS1. The fact that another antibody that recognizes the initiating form of RNAPII, 8WG16, also shows lower levels of initiating RNAPII on FRDA alleles and that levels of H3K4Me3, a histone modification characteristic of the early phases of transcription initiation, are also lower than normal would be consistent with our Ser(P)-5 RNAPII data. Thus, our data suggest that there is a reduced efficiency of transcription initiation on FRDA alleles for which the repressive chromatin marks on the promoter are the most parsimonious explanation. It seems reasonable to think that the effect on transcription initiation might vary with repeat number and be more marked on those alleles with a larger number of repeats that facilitate a broader spread of repressive chromatin marks from intron 1. A role for the repeat-mediated chromatin changes in the FRDA transcript deficit is consistent with the fact that histone deacetylase inhibitors increase transcription from FRDA alleles (3Herman D. Jenssen K. Burnett R. Soragni E. Perlman S.L. Gottesfeld J.M. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 551-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 6Rai M. Soragni E. Jenssen K. Burnett R. Herman D.

Biol. 2009; 16: 980-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This idea has been challenged by the recent demonstration that an inhibitor of H3K9 methylation does not reactivate FRDA alleles. This has led to the suggestion that the chromatin changes are not responsible for the FXN mRNA deficit and thus that the histone deacetylase inhibitors are acting indirectly to increase FXN transcription (16Punga T. Bühler M. EMBO Mol. Med. 2010; 2: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, it may be that H3K9 demethylation is not sufficient to reverse all of the key determinants of repressive chromatin on FRDA alleles. Our demonstration of a repeat-mediated effect on transcription initiation lends support to the idea that the chromatin changes on FRDA alleles have consequences for transcription and thus that histone deacetylase inhibitors may be acting, at least in part, on the underlying cause of FRDA. The lack of significant accumulation of H3K36Me3 downstream of the GAA·TTC suggests that a problem with transcription elongation may also contribute to the mRNA deficit in FRDA. The relative contribution of the elongation problem and the initiation problem remains to be assessed. The question of whether the elongation problem results from the chromatin changes in the body of the gene or the formation of DNA structures that trap RNAPII on the template also remains to be seen. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that FRDA alleles show problems with both transcription initiation and elongation and suggest that repeat-induced chromatin changes are responsible for some, if not all, of the resultant FXN mRNA deficit. This lends support to the idea that histone deacetylase inhibitors, which are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of FRDA, act directly to correct the underlying problem caused by the expanded repeats. The contribution of any non-chromatin-based effects of the repeat to the FXN mRNA deficit remains an open question.

https://openalex.org/W2092936376,"In eukaryotes, introns are located in nuclear and organelle genes from several kingdoms. Large introns (up to 5 kbp) are frequent in mitochondrial genomes of plant and fungi but scarce in Metazoa, even if these organisms are grouped with fungi among the Opisthokonts. Mitochondrial introns are classified in two groups (I and II) according to their RNA secondary structure involved in the intron self-splicing mechanism. Most of these mitochondrial group I introns carry a ""Homing Endonuclease Gene"" (heg) encoding a DNA endonuclease acting in transfer and site-specific integration (""homing"") and allowing intron spreading and gain after lateral transfer even between species from different kingdoms. Opposed to this gain mechanism, is another which implies that introns, which would have been abundant in the ancestral genes, would mainly evolve by loss. The importance of both mechanisms (loss and gain) is matter of debate. Here we report the sequence of the cox1 gene of the button mushroom Agaricus bisporus, the most widely cultivated mushroom in the world. This gene is both the longest mitochondrial gene (29,902 nt) and the largest group I intron reservoir reported to date with 18 group I and 1 group II. An exhaustive analysis of the group I introns available in cox1 genes shows that they are mobile genetic elements whose numerous events of loss and gain by lateral transfer combine to explain their wide and patchy distribution extending over several kingdoms. An overview of intron distribution, together with the high frequency of eroded heg, suggests that they are evolving towards loss. In this landscape of eroded and lost intron sequences, the A. bisporus cox1 gene exhibits a peculiar dynamics of intron keeping and catching, leading to the largest collection of mitochondrial group I introns reported to date in a Eukaryote."
https://openalex.org/W2168433427,"Cdc14 phosphatase regulates multiple events during anaphase and is essential for mitotic exit in budding yeast. Cdc14 is regulated in both a spatial and temporal manner. It is sequestered in the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle by the nucleolar protein Net1 and is released into the nucleus and cytoplasm during anaphase. To identify novel binding partners of Cdc14, we used affinity purification of Cdc14 and mass spectrometric analysis of interacting proteins from strains in which Cdc14 localization or catalytic activity was altered. To alter Cdc14 localization, we used a strain deleted for NET1, which causes full release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus. To alter Cdc14 activity, we generated mutations in the active site of Cdc14 (C283S or D253A), which allow binding of substrates, but not dephosphorylation, by Cdc14. Using this strategy, we identified new interactors of Cdc14, including multiple proteins involved in mitotic events. A subset of these proteins displayed increased affinity for catalytically inactive mutants of Cdc14 compared with the wild-type version, suggesting they are likely substrates of Cdc14. We have also shown that several of the novel Cdc14-interacting proteins, including Kar9 (a protein that orients the mitotic spindle) and Bni1 and Bnr1 (formins that nucleate actin cables and may be important for actomyosin ring contraction) are specifically dephosphorylated by Cdc14 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest the dephosphorylation of the formins may be important for their observed localization change during exit from mitosis and indicate that Cdc14 targets proteins involved in wide-ranging mitotic events."
https://openalex.org/W2062344046,"Resistance to chloroquine of malaria strains is known to be associated with a parasite protein named PfCRT, the mutated form of which is able to reduce chloroquine accumulation in the digestive vacuole of the pathogen. Whether the protein mediates extrusion of the drug acting as a channel or as a carrier and which is the protonation state of its chloroquine substrate is the subject of a scientific debate. We present here an analytical approach that explores which combination of hypotheses on the mechanism of transport and the protonation state of chloroquine are consistent with available equilibrium experimental data. We show that the available experimental data are not, by themselves, sufficient to conclude whether the protein acts as a channel or as a transporter, which explains the origin of their different interpretation by different authors. Interestingly, though, each of the two models is only consistent with a subset of hypotheses on the protonation state of the transported molecule. The combination of these results with a sequence and structure analysis of PfCRT, which strongly suggests that the molecule is a carrier, indicates that the transported species is either or both the mono and di-protonated forms of chloroquine. We believe that our results, besides shedding light on the mechanism of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum, have implications for the development of novel therapies against resistant malaria strains and demonstrate the usefulness of an approach combining systems biology strategies with structural bioinformatics and experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W1554292371,"Although members of the p63 family of transcription factors are known for their role in the development and differentiation of epithelial surfaces, their function in cancer is less clear. Here, we show that depletion of the ΔNp63α and β isoforms, leaving only ΔNp63γ, results in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the normal breast cell line MCF10A. EMT can be rescued by the expression of the ΔNp63α isoform. We also show that ΔNp63γ expressed in a background where all the other ΔNp63 are knocked down causes EMT with an increase in TGFβ-1, -2, and -3 and downstream effectors Smads2/3/4. In addition, a p63 binding site in intron 1 of TGFβ was identified. Inhibition of the TGFβ response with a specific inhibitor results in reversion of EMT in ΔNp63α- and β-depleted cells. In summary, we show that p63 is involved in inhibiting EMT and reduction of certain p63 isoforms may be important in the development of epithelial cancers."

It has been hypothesized that invasion of the central nervous system (CNS) is a complication of a bacteremic condition. In this study, we aimed to characterize the invasion route of N. meningitidis to the CNS. Using an intranasally challenged mouse disease model, we found that twenty percent of the mice developed lethal meningitis even though no bacteria could be detected in blood. Upon bacterial infection, epithelial lesions and redistribution of intracellular junction protein N-cadherin were observed at the nasal epithelial mucosa, especially at the olfactory epithelium, which is functionally and anatomically connected to the CNS. Bacteria were detected in the submucosa of the olfactory epithelium, along olfactory nerves in the cribriform plate, at the olfactory bulb and subsequently at the meninges and subarachnoid space. Furthermore, our data suggest that a threshold level of bacteremia is required for the development of meningococcal sepsis. Taken together, N. meningitidis is able to pass directly from nasopharynx to meninges through the olfactory nerve system. This study enhances our understanding how N. meningitidis invades the meninges. The nasal olfactory nerve system may be a novel target for disease prevention that can improve outcome and survival."

Upon xenobiotic activation of ectopic human PXR, human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells were found to exhibit increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and to subsequently change morphology and migrate. p38 MAPK was responsible for the regulation of these morphological changes and cell migration because the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB239063 repressed both.

Through the regulation of these metabolisms, PXR can be playing critical roles in the development of various types of metabolic diseases such as hepatic hypertrophy, acetaminophen and bilirubin toxicities, steatosis, cholestasis, diabetes, and osteomalacia (6Kakizaki S.

Although these metabolic roles and the clinical implications of PXR have now been established, a nonmetabolic role of PXR in the regulation of cellular signals has now begun to emerge. For example, NF-κβ-mediated inflammatory signals and bowel inflammation was up-regulated in Pxr−/− mouse (3Zhou C. Tabb M.M. Nelson E.L. Grün F. Verma S. Sadatrafiei A. Lin M. Mallick S. Forman B.M.

PXR represses drug-induced apoptosis in various cell systems, human and rat primary hepatocytes and human colon cancer HTC cells (11Zucchini N. de Sousa G. Bailly-Maitre B. Gugenheim J. Bars R.

The key questions, however, remain unanswered at the present time: what are the direct targets of PXR that initiate signals and what is the molecular mechanism by which PXR regulates these targets? GADD45β, is an immediate-early response gene induced by various physiological and environmental stressors, including cytokines and genotoxic stresses (13Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. J. Mol. Signal. 2008; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Through protein-protein interactions with numerous signal molecules, GADD45β can regulate cellular signals for cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis, depending on the types of stimuli and cells that are stimulated (14Vairapandi M.

For example, GADD45β activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway via direct interaction with MTK1/MEKK4, a MAPK kinase kinase (15Miyake Z. Takekawa M. Ge Q. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Mita H. Tsutsui J. Takekawa M. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4544-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), repressing angiogenesis in the human pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 cells (18Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We utilized human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells stably expressing human PXR (called ShP51) and observed that activation of PXR by an antibiotic rifampicin (RIF) stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Subsequent microarray analysis identified the GADD45β gene as the gene induced prior to activation of p38 MAPK signal pathway immediately after RIF treatment in HepG2 cells. Therefore, we investigated the molecular mechanism in which PXR elicits a p38 MAPK signal by directly activating the GADD45β gene. PXR bound directly to the newly identified response element within the GADD45β promoter and activated it in cell-based transcription assays. An overexpression of GADD45β resulted in the increase phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in HepG2 cells, whereas siRNA knockdown of GADD45β decreased PXR-dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in ShP51 cells. ShP51 cells were also found to change morphology and migrate after RIF treatment. Chemical inhibition of p38 MAPK repressed these morphological changes and migration. Our present study has clearly demonstrated a novel PXR function and has provided us with the basis to investigate the molecular mechanism by which PXR regulates cell signals and fates such as morphology and migration. Because humans are constantly exposed to numerous therapeutics and xenobiotics, a PXR-elicited cell signal may become a critical factor in understanding human susceptibility to the toxicity and carcinogenicity caused by chemical exposures.

Biochem. J. 2007; 407: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA of human GADD45β, that was cloned from HepG2 with the use of primer pair 5′-GGTACCATGACGCTGGAAGAGCTCGTGGCG-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCGTTCCTGAAGAGAGATGTAGGGG-3′, was inserted into pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3.1/hGADD45β. pCR3/hPXRR98C and pcDNA3.1/hPXRR98C were generated from pCR3/hPXR and pcDNA3.1/hPXR, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and a proper pair of mutagenic oligonucleotides. Human PXRR98C cDNA, digested from pCR3/hPXRR98C, was inserted into pAdtrackCMV vector (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) to produce adeno-hPXRR98C. The −1565/+47 region of the human GADD45β promoter was amplified from human genomic DNA (Promega, Madison, WI) using LA Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan) and the following primers: 5′-GAGATCTGTATGTTGCATGCGTAAAACATTGCAT-3′ and 5′-CAAGCTTGCGAGGATAATCCAGGAAGTTGCGG-3′. Amplified DNA was digested with BglII and HindIII and was inserted into pGL3-Basic (Promega) to yield pGL3/hG45β. To generate pGL3/hG45βcore containing the −66/+47 region of GADD45β promoter, a XhoI site was inserted into pGL3/hG45β by site-directed mutagenesis, following digestion with XhoI and self-ligation. A double-stranded oligonucleotide 5′-CAGGCAGATCATTTGAGGTCAGGAGAGGCAGATCATTTGAGGTCAGGAGAGGCAGATCATTTGAGGTCAGGAGC-3′ was inserted into the XhoI site of pGL3/hG45βcore to generate pGL3/3×DR4hG45βcore. Human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 and Huh7 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively, total RNAs and whole cell lysates were prepared from HepG2 cells that were treated with 10 μm RIF (Sigma-Aldrich) or 3 μm SR12813 (Sigma-Aldrich) in FBS-free MEM for a given time. For luciferase reporter assays, Huh7 cells were co-transfected with human GADD45β promoter-firefly luciferase, pRL-CMV for Renilla luciferase control (Promega), and pCR3/hPXR or pCR3/hPXRR98C, using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The final amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted by adding pcDNA3.1-V5-His as empty vector control. Twenty four hours after transfection, these cells were subsequently treated with a given drug in FBS-free MEM for an additional 24 h. Luciferase reporter activities were measured as described previously (2Kodama S. Koike C. Negishi M. Yamamoto Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7931-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). For ectopic expression of GADD45β, trypsinized HepG2 cells were reverse-transfected with increasing amount of pcDNA3.1/hGADD45β, using FuGENE 6. The final amounts of transfected DNAs were adjusted by adding pcDNA3.1-V5-His. After 30 h, whole cell lysates were prepared. For adenoviral infection, HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM containing adeno-β-galactosidase, adeno-hPXR, or adeno-hPXRR98C at 10 of multiple of infection. After 30 h, these cells were treated with 10 μm RIF or 3 μm SR12813 in FBS-free MEM for a given time. Then, total RNAs and whole cell lysates were prepared. For siRNA knockdown, trypsinized HepG2 cells were reverse-transfected with 40 μm ON-TARGETplus SMART pool GADD45β (catalogue number L-003894-00) or ON-TARGETplus siCONTROL nontargeting pool (catalogue number D-001810-10) from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO) in MEM for 48 h, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Then, these cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or RIF in FBS-free MEM for 1 h, from which total RNAs and whole cell lysates were prepared for qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. For knockdown of p38 MAPK, cells were reverse-transfected with ON-TARGETplus SMART pool p38 MAPK (catalogue number L-003512-00) for 36 h and were subsequently treated with RIF for a given time. HepG2 cells were transfected with pCR3/hPXR by FuGENE 6 and were selected in MEM containing G418 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 800 μg/ml. Drug-resistant colonies were further selected and verified by Western blotting of PXR and qRT-PCR of CYP3A4 to establish ShP51 cells. Cells were lysed and denatured in a fixed volume of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen), from which a fixed volume was separated on a 8.5%, a 10%, or a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were transferred onto PVDF membrane. This membrane was blocked with 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a given primary antibody in TBS-T containing 5% BSA for additional 16 h at 4 °C, prior to the incubation with secondary antibody in TBS-T with 5% milk for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL plus Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healthcare). Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) to synthesize cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR was performed with an ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Assays-on-demand probes (Applied Biosystems) were used for PCR with the TaqMAN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), Hs00430021_m1 for the human CYP3A4 gene. The following PCR primers were used with the SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems): hGADD45β-RT-S, 5′-CGGTGGAGGAGCTTTTGGT-3′ and hGADD45β-RT-AS, 5′-GCTGTCTGGGTCCACATTCA-3′ for the human GADD45β gene. The TaqMAN human β-actin control regents kit (Applied Biosystems) was used as the internal control. cDNAs for human PXR in pCR3/hPXR, human PXRR98C in pCR3/h PXRR98C and human RXR in pCMX/hRXR were in vitro translated by using a TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The double-stranded probes used for hGADD45β-DR4 and CYP3A4-ER6 were 5′-GATCAGGCAGATCATTTGAGGTCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCATATGAACTCAAAGGAGGTCAGTG-3′, respectively, which were labeled by using [32P]dATP and DNA polymerase Klenow fragment. The double-stranded probe 5′-GATCATAGGAACGCAAAGGCGGTCCGTG-3′ (CYP3A4-ER6mt) was used for competition assays. Using these proteins and probes, gel shift assays were performed as described previously (19Honkakoski P. Zelko I. Sueyoshi T. Negishi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). For competition and supershift assays, unlabeled probe, normal mouse IgG, and anti-human PXR antibody were preincubated for 15 min before adding the radioactive probes to start reactions. ChIP assay was performed using a ChIP assay kit (Millipore). Briefly, trypsinized HepG2 cells were reverse-transfected with pcDNA3.1-V5-His, pcDNA3.1/hPXR, or pcDNA3.1/hPXRR98C, using FuGENE 6. After 48 h, these cells were treated with RIF in FBS-free MEM for 1 h, cross-linked by adding formaldehyde (final concentration of 1% (v/v)) in medium, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Pellets of these cross-linked cells were sonicated to shear DNA in the SDS lysis buffer on wet ice. After being precleared by shaking with protein A agarose, these lysates were incubated with anti-V5 antibody or normal mouse IgG at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitated DNA was purified by following the manufacturer's instructions combined with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and was used as a template for semiquantitative PCR with LA Taq polymerase (TaKaRa). The following primers were used for PCR: for hGADD45β-DR4, 5′-CCAAATACGGTGACTCACGCCTGTAATTC-3′ and 5′-GTAGAGACAGGGTTTTGCCATGTTG-3′; for hGADD45β-nega, 5′-GCACAATCTCGGCTCACTGCAACC-3′ and 5′-GATCGAGACCATCCTGGCCAACATG-3′; for CYP3A4-XREM, 5′-ACTCATGTCCCAATTAAAGGTC-3′ and 5′-TGTTCTTGTCAGAAGTTCAGC-3′ (20Gu X.

For migration assay, cells were seeded onto the upper surface of dividing membrane (8 μm pore size) of a Transwell Boyden chamber (Corning Inc., Corning, NY). After 24 h, the upper chambers were loaded with FBS-free MEM with or without 10 μm SB239063 and FBS-free MEM with or without 10 μm RIF, and 10 μm SB239063 (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the lower well. After incubation for 48 h, the membranes were fixed in PBS containing 5% (v/v) formaldehyde and stained with a 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet solution. The number of cells migrated to the reverse surface of the membrane was counted in three randomly selected fields under light microscopy. Forty eight hours after seeding, cells were incubated in FBS-free MEM with drugs for another 48 h. These cells were fixed in PBS containing 5% (v/v) formaldehyde, followed by staining with a 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet solution. To see actin organization, these drug-treated cells were fixed in PBS containing 5% (v/v) formaldehyde, incubated in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and washed with PBS, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen) and by observing the cells under a confocal microscopy. Additional procedures may be found in supplemental Methods. Twenty independent HepG2 cells stably expressing human PXR were cloned via neomycin resistance. As shown in one of them, named ShP51 cells, all of these stable cells were confirmed to express PXR protein and to activate its typical target CYP3A4 gene after treatments with two classic activators RIF and SR12813 for 24 h (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates prepared from these same parental HepG2 and ShP51 cells revealed that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was greatly increased after drug treatments (Fig. 1B). Given this finding, time-dependent increases of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its upstream and downstream kinases were examined; MAPK kinase (MKK) 3/6 and MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), respectively (Fig. 1C). In ShP51 cells after being treated with RIF, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was dramatically increased as early as 30 min and reached an apparent peak at 60 min. This high level of this p38 MAPK phosphorylation remained 240 min after RIF treatment. Increase of phosphorylation of MKK3/6 was found to be as fast as that of p38 MAPK after RIF treatment, whereas MK2 exhibited a delayed increase of phosphorylation compared with those of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK. Phosphorylation of MK2 was first increased 60 min after RIF treatment and thereafter remained increased in the ShP51 cells. Any of these phosphorylations were not observed in RIF-treated parental HepG2 cells. These results indicate that PXR activated MKK3/6-p38 MAPK-MK2 signal in response to drug treatment. Subsequently, phosphorylation levels of JNK1/2, ERK1/2, AKT, and AMPK were investigated to examine specificity of PXR-activated phosphorylation in ShP51 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Phosphorylation of JNK1/2 was increased, but this increase was weak until 120 min after RIF treatment. Those of ERK1/2, AKT, and AMPK were not increased in any time of RIF treatment. Thus, the PXR-induced increase of p38 MAPK was a quick and relatively specific response to RIF treatment in ShP51 cells. Because PXR is a ligand-dependent transcription factor, its primary targets are genes. We asked whether PXR elicited p38 MAPK phosphorylation via activating a gene. Naturally occurring mutation of arginine 98 to cysteine abolished DNA-binding ability of PXR (21Koyano S. Kurose K. Saito Y. Ozawa S. Hasegawa R. Komamura K. Ueno K. Kamakura S. Kitakaze M. Nakajima T. Matsumoto K. Akasawa A. Saito H. Sawada J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Utilizing this mutation, we examined whether or not PXR required its DNA-binding ability to elicit phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. For this purpose, wild-type PXR and its PXRR98C mutant were ectopically expressed in HepG2 cells. Consisting with the lack of DNA binding, adenovirus-based expressing PXRR98C did not activate the expression of CYP3A4 gene in HepG2 cells following RIF treatment (Fig. 2A). As can be seen in Fig. 2B, PXRR98C was not able to increase the phosphorylation levels of both MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK after RIF treatment (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that PXR increased phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by activating a gene in RIF-treated HepG2 cells. To identify the PXR-activated gene required for the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, we initially performed microarray analysis (supplemental Table S1), from which the immediate-early response GADD45β gene was selected for further investigation. This selection was made based on the fact that GADD45β is known to regulate phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (15Miyake Z. Takekawa M. Ge Q. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Mita H. Tsutsui J. Takekawa M. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4544-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and the hypothesis that the gene needs to quickly respond to PXR activation to stimulate p38 MAPK phosphorylation within 30 min following RIF treatment. Increase of GADD45β mRNA was, in fact, detected as early as 15 min and peaked 60 min following RIF treatment in ShP51 cells but not in parent HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). The GADD45β mRNA remained at this level for 24 h following RIF treatment (data not shown). This quick response of the GADD45β gene became more evident when it was compared with a slower increase of the CYP3A4 mRNA, the classic PXR-targeted gene: the most significant increase in CYP3A4 mRNA occurred between 60 and 120 min after RIF treatment. However, the RIF-induced increase of GADD45β mRNA was not observed in HepG2 cells infected with adenovirus expressing PXRR98C mutant, substantiating the notion that PXR binds directly to the GADD45β gene and activates its transcription (Fig. 3B). Hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7 cells were utilized to confirm that the observed PXR-mediated increase of GADD45β mRNA and of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not specific to HepG2 cells (supplemental Fig. S2). These results suggested that GADD45β was the direct target of PXR to elicit p38 MAPK signal. Direct activation by PXR of the GADD45β gene was further investigated by performing gel shift, luciferase reporter, and ChIP assays. Motif analysis revealed a direct repeat 4 (DR4) sequence (−4386AGATCATTTGAGGTCA−4371) within a 10-kb GADD45β promoter as a putative site for PXR binding. Gel shift assays showed a specific binding of PXR·RXR complex to the DR4 sequence which was confirmed by supershift using anti-human PXR antibody (Fig. 4A). A triple repeat of the DR4 sequence was placed in front of the −66/+47 bp of the hG45βcore-Luc reporter plasmid which contains the GADD45β proximal promoter to produce 3×DR4-hG45βcore-Luc. These reporter plasmids were co-transfected with either PXR or PXRR98C expression plasmid into Huh7 cells. PXR activated the 3×DR4-hG45βcore-Luc, but not the hG45βcore-Luc in RIF-treated Huh7 cells (Fig. 4B). PXRR98C did not activate either 3×DR4-hG45βcore-Luc or hG45βcore-Luc. Finally, ChIP assays confirmed the binding of PXR to the DR4 sequence of the GADD45β promoter, in which V5-tagged PXR and PXRR98C were ectopically expressed in RIF-treated HepG2 cells. PXR, but not PXRR98C, clearly bound to the DR4 of the GADD45β promoter, similar to those observed in the CYP3A4 promoter (Fig. 4C). In contrast, PXR did not bind to a region lacking the DR4. These results indicate that PXR can directly activate the GADD45β gene. To examine whether GADD45β was responsible for RIF-induced increase of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, GADD45β was either overexpressed in HepG2 cells or knocked down in ShP51 cells. Ectopic GADD45β was expressed in HepG2 cells by transfecting the GADD45β expression plasmid in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting showed a barely detectable expression of GADD45β at 0.1 and 0.3 μg of transfected plasmid and a high expression at 0.9 μg (Fig. 5A). Elevated phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK was already detected at 0.1 μg, which was further increased at 0.3 μg. These phosphorylations were saturated at 0.3 μg and were no longer increased at 0.9 μg. This phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK, thus, appeared to be very sensitive to GADD45β. Similar results were also obtained in Huh7 cells (data not shown). Next, we utilized siRNA to knock down endogenous GADD45β in ShP51 cells to ascertain whether GADD45β can determine a PXR-dependent p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Transfection of GADD45β siRNA, but not control siRNA, repressed PXR-elicited phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK in ShP51 cells following RIF treatment (Fig. 5B). In those cells, GADD45β siRNA specifically decreased both basal and induced levels of GADD45β mRNA, but not those of CYP3A4 mRNA. GADD45β, thus, mediated PXR-dependent phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK, suggesting that PXR activated the GADD45β gene and the induced GADD45β, in turn, stimulated p38 MAPK signal. PXR, upon activation by RIF, directly activates the GADD45β gene to elicit p38 MAPK signal in HepG2 cells. Activation of p38 MAPK could have various consequences for cell response, including cell migration and apoptosis. We first observed that ShP51 cells, but not parental HepG2 cells, underwent a striking morphological change wherein cells scattered and flattened upon treatment with RIF or SR12813 (Fig. 6A). The additional 14 clones of HepG2 cell lines stably expressing PXR also changed their morphology in the same manner as ShP51 cells (data not shown). Moreover, adenovirus-based expressing PXR, but not PXRR98C, caused morphological changes after RIF treatment similar to those observed in ShP51 cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Thus, these results clearly indicated that the observed morphological changes occurred as a consequence of PXR activation by drugs. A subsequent immunohistochemical study showed that these morphological changes were accompanied with the reorganization of actin filaments often observed during cell migration (Fig. 6B): formations of stress fiber, lamellipodia, and filopodia (22Sipeki S. Bander E. Buday L. Farkas G. Bácsy E. Ways D.K. Faragó A. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23McAllister S.S. Becker-Hapak M. Pintucci G. Pagano M. Dowdy S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 216-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, transwell migration assays were performed to examine whether or not ShP51 cells would migrate after treatments with RIF and SR12813. Cells that migrated onto the other side of the transwell were visualized, and their numbers were counted in Fig. 6C. ShP51 cells, but not parental HepG2 cells, were found to exhibit a 5-fold increase in migration following treatment with RIF and SR12813. Thus, drug activation of PXR resulted in morphological changes, leading ShP51 cells to migrate. In addition, cell growth was not affected throughout the duration of morphological changes and migration after treatments with RIF and SR12813 (data not shown). The specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB239063 was employed to link PXR-mediated morphological changes and cell migration with p38 MAPK in HepG2 cells. Under the assay condition, phosphorylation of an immediate p38 MAPK downstream kinase MK2 was completely inhibited by concentrations as low as 10 μm SB239063 in RIF-treated ShP51 cells (Fig. 7A). Accordingly, ShP51 and parental HepG2 cells were co-treated with RIF and 10 μm SB239063 and were subjected to morphological and transwell migration analyses to examine whether or not p38 MAPK, in fact, regulated PXR-induced morphological changes and migration. No morphological changes were observed in ShP51 cells co-treated with SB239063 (Fig. 7B). A 5-fold increase by RIF treatment of migration of ShP51 cells was completely repressed by co-treatment with SB239063 (Fig. 7C). SB239063 treatment also increased c-Jun phosphorylation in both parental HepG2 and ShP51 cells (Fig. 7A). To confirm the role of the p38 MAPK in RIF-induced morphological changes, ShP51 cells were transfected with siRNA to knock down endogenous p38 MAPK. This knockdown resulted in significant repression of RIF-induced morphological changes (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, p38 MAPK was demonstrated to be responsible for the PXR-induced morphological changes and cell migration. Upon drug activation, PXR has now been shown to directly activate the GADD45β gene by binding to a DR4 sequence within its promoter, eliciting a MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signal and migrating HepG2 cells. The PXR regulation of cell migration via the GADD45β gene emphasizes the possibility that PXR may play diverse roles within the realms of cell regulation, because GADD45β is known to regulate various types of cellular functions from apoptosis to cell cycle and DNA repair through its interactions with various signal factors such as the cdc2/cyclin B1 complex and PCNA (13Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. J. Mol. Signal. 2008; 3: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). GADD45β is rapidly induced by genotoxic/oxidative stresses and cytokines and acts as a stress sensor to coordinate cellular response signals such as cell survival and apoptosis. TGFβ is one such stress-mediated factor that activates the GADD45β gene to promote apoptosis via p38 MAPK signal: the TGFβ-induced apoptosis and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were diminished in the primary hepatocytes prepared from Gadd45β KO mice (24Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In our present study with HepG2 cells, induction of GADD45β by PXR had no affect on cell growth under the experimental conditions used; the known TGFβ-induced apoptosis-resistant nature of HepG2 cells could be a factor in this phenomenon (25Musch A. Rabe C. Paik M.D. Berna M.J. Schmitz V. Hoffmann P. Nischalke H.D. Sauerbruch T. Caselmann W.H. Digestion. 2005; 71: 78-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Instead, an up-regulated GADD45β-MKK3/6-p38 MAPK signal resulted in epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like morphological changes and migration of HepG2 cells. This finding, however, is consistent with the previous observations that TGFβ causes HepG2 cells to invade (26Liu X. Yang Y. Zhang X. Xu S. He S. Huang W. Roberts M.S. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2010; 25: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and that p38 MAPK mediates TGFβ-induced migration of mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells (27Bakin A.V. Rinehart C. Tomlinson A.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3193-3206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is recently reported that activation of p38 MAPK signal pathway leads hepatocellular carcinoma to migrate (28Yang F. Yin Y. Wang F. Wang Y. Zhang L. Tang Y. Sun S. Hepatology. 2010; 51: 1614-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MK2, a well known downstream kinase of p38 MAPK, is known to regulate cell migration in various cells by activating signals such as heat shock protein 27 and LIM-kinase 1 (29Huang C. Jacobson K. Schaller M.D. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4619-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar, 30Kobayashi M. Nishita M. Mishima T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 713-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of MK2 may be a critical factor in regulating RIF-induced morphological changes and the migration of HepG2 cells, although it remains to be proven in future investigations. CAR (NR1I3) belongs to the same NR1I subfamily as PXR does: CAR and PXR can be activated by an overlapping group of therapeutics and activate the overlapping target genes (31Maglich J.M. Stoltz C.M. Goodwin B. Hawkins-Brown D. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Similar to PXR, CAR activated the GADD45β gene in HepG2 cells (32Yamamoto Y. Negishi M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CAR was also found to activate the Gadd45β gene in mouse livers, and this activation occurred independently from the NFκβ-mediated pathway (32Yamamoto Y. Negishi M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 1189-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Columbano A. Ledda-Columbano G.M. Pibiri M. Cossu C. Menegazzi M. Moore D.D. Huang W. Tian J. Locker J. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In mouse primary hepatocytes, CAR up-regulated Gadd45β, repressing TNFα-induced phosphorylation of JNK and JNK-mediated cell death (34Yamamoto Y. Moore R. Flavell R.A. Lu B. Negishi M. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In supporting the hypothesis that CAR may regulate cell death via Gadd45β gene, a recent study with Gadd45β KO mice nicely demonstrated that Gadd45β attenuates TNFα-induced JNK phosphorylation and liver regeneration after a partial hepatectomy (35Papa S. Zazzeroni F. Fu Y.X. Bubici C. Alvarez K. Dean K. Christiansen P.A. Anders R.A. Franzoso G. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 1911-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Given various known overlapping functions of PXR, it is anticipated that further investigations will reveal that PXR may play similar roles as well as yet identified new roles. Using Pxr+/+ and Pxr−/− mice, we confirmed that PXR induced Gadd45β and increased phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK in mouse liver in vivo (supplemental Fig. S5). Any physiological/pathophysiological role of induction of GADD45β and activation of p38 MAPK signal pathway by PXR in the liver remains virtually unexplored at the present time. Our present findings may have provided new insights into understanding the molecular mechanisms by which therapeutics causes various cell signal responses such as hepatomegaly, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration, thereby affecting human susceptibility to therapeutic exposures (7Staudinger J. Liu Y. Madan A. Habeebu S. Klaassen C.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1467-1472PubMed Google Scholar, 36Dai G. He L. Bu P. Wan Y.J. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In conclusion, GADD45β as the gene directly activated by PXR presents a novel target for future investigation concerned with the molecular mechanism by which the therapeutic activation of PXR can cause beneficial as well as adverse effects to liver physiology. Because various nuclear hormone receptors are known to cross-talk with the members of the GADD45 family (37Yi Y.W. Kim D. Jung N. Hong S.S. Lee H.S. Bae I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), PXR activation by therapeutics and the resulted induction of GADD45β gene may also modulate the nuclear receptor-mediated hormonal responses and homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2020873495,"Understanding the physiology of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in the context of cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders is of paramount importance, yet large-scale studies are hampered by the slow-expansion rate of these cells. To overcome this issue, we previously established immortal, non-transformed, telencephalic-diencephalic hNSCs (IhNSCs) from the fetal brain. Here, we investigated the fate of these IhNSC's immediate progeny (i.e. neural progenitors; IhNSC-Ps) upon unilateral implantation into the corpus callosum or the hippocampal fissure of adult rat brain, 3 days after global ischemic injury. One month after grafting, approximately one fifth of the IhNSC-Ps had survived and migrated through the corpus callosum, into the cortex or throughout the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. By the fourth month, they had reached the ipsilateral subventricular zone, CA1-3 hippocampal layers and the controlateral hemisphere. Notably, these results could be accomplished using transient immunosuppression, i.e administering cyclosporine for 15 days following the ischemic event. Furthermore, a concomitant reduction of reactive microglia (Iba1+ cells) and of glial, GFAP+ cells was also observed in the ipsilateral hemisphere as compared to the controlateral one. IhNSC-Ps were not tumorigenic and, upon in vivo engraftment, underwent differentiation into GFAP+ astrocytes, and β-tubulinIII+ or MAP2+ neurons, which displayed GABAergic and GLUTAmatergic markers. Electron microscopy analysis pointed to the formation of mature synaptic contacts between host and donor-derived neurons, showing the full maturation of the IhNSC-P-derived neurons and their likely functional integration into the host tissue. Thus, IhNSC-Ps possess long-term survival and engraftment capacity upon transplantation into the globally injured ischemic brain, into which they can integrate and mature into neurons, even under mild, transient immunosuppressive conditions. Most notably, transplanted IhNSC-P can significantly dampen the inflammatory response in the lesioned host brain. This work further supports hNSCs as a reliable and safe source of cells for transplantation therapy in neurodegenerative disorders."

Recently, the role of the deubiquitinating protease A20 in regulating the LPS response in various organs was reported. In the present study, we investigated whether A20 is expressed in osteoclast cultures in response to RANKL or LPS and whether this protein plays a role in osteoclast formation and activation. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of M-CSF ± RANKL ± LPS. Although LPS induced the formation of multinucleated TRAP-positive cells expressing OSCAR, cathepsin K, and the calcitonin receptor, these cells were not capable of lacunar resorption. Release of TNF-α was noted in LPS-treated cultures, and the addition of a neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibody abrogated osteoclast formation in these cultures. A20 appeared to be a late-expressed gene in LPS-treated cultures and was associated with TRAF6 degradation and NF-κB inhibition. Silencing of A20 restored TRAF6 expression and NF-κB activation and resulted in increased bone resorption in LPS-treated cultures. A20 appeared important in the control of bone resorption and could represent a therapeutic target to treat patients with bone resorption associated with inflammatory diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2008248840,"As a culmination of efforts over the last years, our knowledge of the embryonic origins of the mammalian frontal and parietal cranial bones is unambiguous. Progenitor cells that subsequently give rise to frontal bone are of neural crest origin, while parietal bone progenitors arise from paraxial mesoderm. Given the unique qualities of neural crest cells and the clear delineation of the embryonic origins of the calvarial bones, we sought to determine whether mouse neural crest derived frontal bone differs in biology from mesoderm derived parietal bone.BrdU incorporation, immunoblotting and osteogenic differentiation assays were performed to investigate the proliferative rate and osteogenic potential of embryonic and postnatal osteoblasts derived from mouse frontal and parietal bones. Co-culture experiments and treatment with conditioned medium harvested from both types of osteoblasts were performed to investigate potential interactions between the two different tissue origin osteoblasts. Immunoblotting techniques were used to investigate the endogenous level of FGF-2 and the activation of three major FGF signaling pathways. Knockdown of FGF Receptor 1 (FgfR1) was employed to inactivate the FGF signaling.Our results demonstrated that striking differences in cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation between the frontal and parietal bone can be detected already at embryonic stages. The greater proliferation rate, as well as osteogenic capacity of frontal bone derived osteoblasts, were paralleled by an elevated level of FGF-2 protein synthesis. Moreover, an enhanced activation of FGF-signaling pathways was observed in frontal bone derived osteoblasts. Finally, the greater osteogenic potential of frontal derived osteoblasts was dramatically impaired by knocking down FgfR1.Osteoblasts from mouse neural crest derived frontal bone displayed a greater proliferative and osteogenic potential and endogenous enhanced activation of FGF signaling compared to osteoblasts from mesoderm derived parietal bone. FGF signaling plays a key role in determining biological differences between the two types of osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2016373103,"The diverse roles of TopBP1 in DNA replication and checkpoint signaling are associated with the scaffolding ability of TopBP1 to initiate various protein-protein interactions. The recognition of the BACH1/FANCJ helicase by TopBP1 is critical for the activation of the DNA replication checkpoint at stalled replication forks and is facilitated by the C-terminal tandem BRCT7/8 domains of TopBP1 and a phosphorylated Thr(1133) binding motif in BACH1. Here we provide the structural basis for this interaction through analysis of the x-ray crystal structures of TopBP1 BRCT7/8 both free and in complex with a BACH1 phospho-peptide. In contrast to canonical BRCT-phospho-peptide recognition, TopBP1 BRCT7/8 undergoes a dramatic conformational change upon BACH1 binding such that the two BRCT repeats pivot about the central BRCT-BRCT interface to provide an extensive and deep peptide-binding cleft. Additionally, we provide the first structural mechanism for Thr(P) recognition among BRCT domains. Together with systematic mutagenesis studies, we highlight the role of key contacts in governing the unique specificity of the TopBP1-BACH1 interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2045606128,"Salt-inducible kinase (SIK), one of the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK)-related kinases, has been suggested to play important functions in glucose homeostasis by inhibiting the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated transcription coactivator (CRTC). To examine the role of SIK in vivo, we generated Drosophila SIK mutant and found that the mutant flies have higher amounts of lipid and glycogen stores and are resistant to starvation. Interestingly, SIK transcripts are highly enriched in the brain, and we found that neuron-specific expression of exogenous SIK fully rescued lipid and glycogen storage phenotypes as well as starvation resistance of the mutant. Using genetic and biochemical analyses, we demonstrated that CRTC Ser-157 phosphorylation by SIK is critical for inhibiting CRTC activity in vivo. Furthermore, double mutants of SIK and CRTC became sensitive to starvation, and the Ser-157 phosphomimetic mutation of CRTC reduced lipid and glycogen levels in the SIK mutant, suggesting that CRTC mediates the effects of SIK signaling. Collectively, our results strongly support the importance of the SIK-CRTC signaling axis that functions in the brain to maintain energy homeostasis in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1963670919,"Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are a well characterized epithelial cell line used to study mechanisms of polarized delivery. As glycans on apically expressed proteins have been identified as targeting signals, and crosslinking by the abundant galectin-3 has been implicated in the mechanism of glycan-dependent sorting, we wanted to identify other members of the galectin (Gal) family expressed in MDCK cells. By analyzing intron-exon boundaries, we identified canine genes that were highly homologous to mammalian Gal-1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 12, and galectin-related HSPC159 and GRIFIN. Transcripts for Gal-2 and -12 were not detected in MDCK cells, but we found transcript levels for Gal-3 > Gal-9 > Gal-8 > Gal-1 ⋙ Gal-4 > Gal-7. Canine Gal-1, -2, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9, and -12 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as GST fusion proteins to characterize binding specificities on arrays of synthetic glycans on glass slides from Core H of the NIH Consortium for Functional Glycomics. Individual expression of the N-terminal (GST-Gal-9N) and C-terminal (GST-Gal-9C) carbohydrate recognition domains greatly improved protein yield and the ability to characterize Gal-9 binding on the array. Canine galectins differentially bound sulfated disaccharides as well as human blood groups A, B, and H on both N-glycans and linear glycan structures on the array. Analysis of GST-Gal-1, -3, -4, -7, -8, -9N, and -9C binding to immunopurified human MUC1 expressed in MDCK cells revealed a preference for binding GST-Gal-3 and -9, which interestingly reflects the two most abundant galectins expressed in MDCK cells."
https://openalex.org/W1971432479,"Many microbial pathogens subvert cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) to infect host cells in vitro. The significance of HSPG-pathogen interactions in vivo, however, remains to be determined. In this study, we examined the role of syndecan-1, a major cell surface HSPG of epithelial cells, in Staphylococcus aureus corneal infection. We found that syndecan-1 null (Sdc1(-/-)) mice significantly resist S. aureus corneal infection compared with wild type (WT) mice that express abundant syndecan-1 in their corneal epithelium. However, syndecan-1 did not bind to S. aureus, and syndecan-1 was not required for the colonization of cultured corneal epithelial cells by S. aureus, suggesting that syndecan-1 does not mediate S. aureus attachment to corneal tissues in vivo. Instead, S. aureus induced the shedding of syndecan-1 ectodomains from the surface of corneal epithelial cells. Topical administration of purified syndecan-1 ectodomains or heparan sulfate (HS) significantly increased, whereas inhibition of syndecan-1 shedding significantly decreased the bacterial burden in corneal tissues. Furthermore, depletion of neutrophils in the resistant Sdc1(-/-) mice increased the corneal bacterial burden to that of the susceptible WT mice, suggesting that syndecan-1 moderates neutrophils to promote infection. We found that syndecan-1 does not affect the infiltration of neutrophils into the infected cornea but that purified syndecan-1 ectodomain and HS significantly inhibit neutrophil-mediated killing of S. aureus. These data suggest a previously unknown bacterial subversion mechanism where S. aureus exploits the capacity of syndecan-1 ectodomains to inhibit neutrophil-mediated bacterial killing mechanisms in an HS-dependent manner to promote its pathogenesis in the cornea."
https://openalex.org/W1985789215,"ING2 (inhibitor of growth family, member 2) is a member of the plant homeodomain (PHD)-containing ING family of putative tumor suppressors. As part of mSin3A-HDAC corepressor complexes, ING2 binds to tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) to regulate chromatin modification and gene expression. ING2 also functionally interacts with the tumor suppressor protein p53 to regulate cellular senescence, apoptosis and DNA damage response in vitro, and is thus expected to modulate carcinogenesis and aging. Here we investigate the developmental and physiological functions of Ing2 through targeted germline disruption. Consistent with its abundant expression in mouse and human testes, male mice deficient for Ing2 showed abnormal spermatogenesis and were infertile. Numbers of mature sperm and sperm motility were significantly reduced in Ing2(-/-) mice (∼2% of wild type, P<0.0001 and ∼10% of wild type, P<0.0001, respectively). Their testes showed degeneration of seminiferous tubules, meiotic arrest before pachytene stage with incomplete meiotic recombination, induction of p53, and enhanced apoptosis. This phenotype was only partially abrogated by concomitant loss of p53 in the germline. The arrested spermatocytes in Ing2(-/-) testes were characterized by lack of specific HDAC1 accumulation and deregulated chromatin acetylation. The role of Ing2 in germ cell maturation may extend to human ING2 as well. Using publicly available gene expression datasets, low expression of ING2 was found in teratozoospermic sperm (>3-fold reduction) and in testes from patients with defective spermatogenesis (>7-fold reduction in Sertoli-cell only Syndrome). This study establishes ING2 as a novel regulator of spermatogenesis functioning through both p53- and chromatin-mediated mechanisms, suggests that an HDAC1/ING2/H3K4me3-regulated, stage-specific coordination of chromatin modifications is essential to normal spermatogenesis, and provides an animal model to study idiopathic and iatrogenic infertility in men. In addition, a bona fide tumor suppressive role of Ing2 is demonstrated by increased incidence of soft-tissue sarcomas in Ing2(-/-) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2023412236,"Understanding the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. We showed here that the transcription factor GATA6 is expressed in different human primary endothelial cells as well as in vascular endothelial cells of mice in vivo. Activation of endothelial cells was associated with GATA6 nuclear translocation, chromatin binding, and enhanced GATA6-dependent transcriptional activation. siRNA-mediated down-regulation of GATA6 after growth factor stimulation led to a dramatically reduced capacity of macro- and microvascular endothelial cells to proliferate, migrate, or form capillary-like structures on Matrigel. Adenoviral overexpression of GATA6 in turn enhanced angiogenic function, especially in cardiac endothelial microvascular cells. Furthermore, GATA6 protected endothelial cells from undergoing apoptosis during growth factor deprivation. Mechanistically, down-regulation of GATA6 in endothelial cells led to increased expression of transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 and TGFβ2, whereas enhanced GATA6 expression, accordingly, suppressed Tgfb1 promoter activity. High TGFβ1/β2 expression in GATA6-depleted endothelial cells increased the activation of the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and SMAD2, and suppression of this signaling axis by TGFβ neutralizing antibody or ALK5 inhibition restored angiogenic function and survival in endothelial cells with reduced GATA6 expression. Together, these findings indicate that GATA6 plays a crucial role for endothelial cell function and survival, at least in part, by suppressing autocrine TGFβ expression and ALK5-dependent signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2066549755,"Metallothioneins (MTs) are small, cysteine-rich polypeptides, but the role of MTs in inducing the formation of adaptive response is still largely unknown. We investigated the roles of metallothionein genes (mtl-1 and mtl-2) in the formation of cross-adaptation response to neurobehavioral toxicity from metal exposure in Caenorhabditis elegans. Pre-treatment with mild heat-shock at L2-larva stage effectively prevented the formation of the neurobehavioral defects and the activation of severe stress response in metal exposed nematodes at concentrations of 50 and 100 µM, but pre-treatment with mild heat-shock did not prevent the formation of neurobehavioral defects in 200 µM of metal exposed nematodes. During the formation of cross-adaptation response, the induction of mtl-1 and mtl-2 promoter activity and subsequent GFP gene expression were sharply increased in 50 µM or 100 µM of metal exposed Pmtl-1::GFP and Pmtl-2::GFP transgenic adult animals after mild heat-shock treatment compared with those treated with mild heat-shock or metal exposure alone. Moreover, after pre-treatment with mild heat-shock, no noticeable increase of locomotion behaviors could be observed in metal exposed mtl-1 or mtl-2 mutant nematodes compared to those without mild heat-shock pre-treatment. The defects of adaptive response to neurobehavioral toxicity induced by metal exposure formed in mtl-1 and mtl-2 mutants could be completely rescued by the expression of mtl-1 and mtl-2 with the aid of their native promoters. Furthermore, over-expression of MTL-1 and MTL-2 at the L2-larval stage significantly suppressed the toxicity on locomotion behaviors from metal exposure at all examined concentrations. Therefore, the normal formation of cross-adaptation response to neurobehavioral toxicity induced by metal exposure may need the enough accumulation of MTs protein in animal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2055364080,"Chondroadherin is a leucine-rich repeat protein known to mediate adhesion of isolated cells via the integrin α(2)β(1) and to interact with collagen. In this work, we show that cell adhesion to chondroadherin leads to activation of MAPKs but does not result in cell spreading and division. This is in contrast to the spreading and dividing of cells grown on collagen, although the binding is mediated via the same α(2)β(1) receptor. We identified a cell binding motif, CQLRGLRRWLEAK(318) by mass spectrometry after protease digestion of chondroadherin. Cells adhering to the synthetic peptide CQLRGLRRWLEAK(318) remained round, as was observed when they bound to the intact protein. The peptide added in solution was able to inhibit cell adhesion to the intact protein in a dose-dependent manner and was also verified to bind to the α(2)β(1) integrin. A cyclic peptide, CQLRGLRRWLEAKASRPDATC(326), mimicking the structural constraints of this sequence in the intact protein, showed similar efficiency in inhibiting binding to chondroadherin. The unique peptide motif responsible for cellular binding is primarily located in the octamer sequence LRRWLEAK(318). Binding of cells to the active peptide or to chondroadherin immobilized on cell culture plates rapidly induces intracellular signaling (i.e. ERK phosphorylation). Thus, chondroadherin interaction with cells may be central for maintaining the adult chondrocyte phenotype and cartilage homeostasis. The peptides, particularly the more stable cyclic peptide, open new opportunities to modulate cell behavior in situations of tissue pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2086851541,"Background Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are main causes of pneumonia or acute lung injury. They are recognized by the innate immune system via toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) or TLR4, respectively. Among all organs, the lungs have the highest expression of TLR2 receptors, but little is known about the pulmonary consequences of their activation. Here we studied the effects of the TLR2/6 agonist MALP-2, the TLR2/1 agonist Pam3Cys and the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on pro-inflammatory responses in isolated lungs. Methodology/Principal Findings Isolated perfused mouse lungs were perfused for 60 min or 180 min with MALP-2 (25 ng/mL), Pam3Cys (160 ng/mL) or LPS (1 µg/mL). We studied mediator release by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the activation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT/protein kinase B by immunoblotting, and gene induction by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All agonists activated the MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, but neither JNK or AKT kinase. The TLR ligands upregulated the inflammation related genes Tnf, Il1β, Il6, Il10, Il12, Ifng, Cxcl2 (MIP-2α) and Ptgs2. MALP-2 was more potent than Pam3Cys in inducing Slpi, Cxcl10 (IP10) and Parg. Remarkable was the strong induction of Tnc by MALP2, which was not seen with Pam3Cys or LPS. The growth factor related genes Areg and Hbegf were not affected. In addition, all three TLR agonists stimulated the release of IL-6, TNF, CXCL2 and CXCL10 protein from the lungs. Conclusions/Significance TLR2 and TLR4 activation leads to similar reactions in the lungs regarding MAPK activation, gene induction and mediator release. Several genes studied here have not yet been appreciated as targets of TLR2-activation in the lungs before, i.e., Slpi, tenascin C, Parg and Traf1. In addition, the MALP-2 dependent induction of Tnc may indicate the existence of TLR2/6-specific pathways."

After its release from glutamatergic nerve terminals, glutamate is quickly taken up into glial and neuronal cells by glutamate transporters belonging to the “excitatory amino acid transporter” (EAAT) 4The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; BN, blue native; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney. family (1Danbolt N.C.

Five different mammalian EAAT isoforms have been identified. Two of those, EAAT1 and EAAT2, are expressed mainly in glia, whereas EAAT3, EAAT4, and EAAT5 are considered to be neuronal transporters. All EAAT glutamate transporters sustain two fundamentally distinct transport mechanisms. They function as stoichiometrically coupled co-transporters of one glutamate, three sodium ions, and one proton, while one potassium ion is countertransported (3Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J.

In addition, all EAATs are capable of functioning as anion channels (5Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Different EAAT isoforms differ in the relative contribution of anion currents to the total transporter-mediated current (5Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P.

These differences have been interpreted as an indication that some EAATs play a physiological role as glutamate transporters (9Tanaka K. Watase K. Manabe T. Yamada K. Watanabe M. Takahashi K.

At present, it is not clear whether distinct isoforms can form heterotrimers, and moreover, whether subunits might acquire new functions within heterotrimeric assemblies. We here use biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to study co-assembly of different EAATs and possible functional consequences of heteromultimerization. Coding regions of rat EAAT1, human EAAT2, rat and human EAAT3, rat EAAT4, and human SLC26A9 were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 or pRcCMV using PCR-based strategies. YFP, GFP, CFP, and His fusion proteins were generated by PCR-based techniques. All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. For each construct, two independent recombinants from the same transformation were examined and shown to exhibit indistinguishable functional properties. Transient transfection of tsA201 and MDCKII cells using the Ca3(PO4)2 technique or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was performed as described previously (8Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). EAAT fusion proteins were purified from tsA201 cells as described (22Detro-Dassen S. Schänzler M. Lauks H. Martin I. zu Berstenhorst S.M. Nothmann D. Torres-Salazar D. Hidalgo P. Schmalzing G. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol.

For PAGE under denaturing conditions, proteins were denatured for 15 min at 56 °C with SDS sample buffer containing 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and electrophoresed on linear SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Blue native (BN)-PAGE was performed immediately after protein purification as described (22Detro-Dassen S. Schänzler M. Lauks H. Martin I. zu Berstenhorst S.M. Nothmann D. Torres-Salazar D.

Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). YFP-tagged proteins were visualized by scanning the wet polyacrylamide gels with a fluorescence scanner (Typhoon 9400; GE Healthcare). Each experiment was at least performed three times and illustrated as representative result. For expression in oocytes, cRNA was synthesized from MluI-linearized pTLN2-hEAAT3 (24Trotti D. Peng J.B. Dunlop J. Hediger M.A. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or from NheI-linearized pGEMHE-R501C rEAAT4 (20Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke C. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) templates through use of MESSAGE machine kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Injection and handling of oocytes were performed as described elsewhere (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Current recordings from oocytes expressing hEAAT3 were usually performed 1 day after injection. To account for differences in expression levels, this period was increased to 4–5 days for R501C rEAAT4. For co-expression experiments in oocytes, hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 RNAs were injected at a 1:5 ratio unless otherwise stated. EAAT-associated currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp using a CA1 amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). Oocytes were held at 0 mV, and currents elicited by 200-ms voltage steps between −120 mV and +80 mV were filtered at 2 kHz (−3d B) and digitized with a sampling rate of 10 kHz, using either a Digidata AD/DA converter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) or an ITC-18 Computer Interface (Instrutech Corporation). The external solution contained 96 mm NaNO3, 4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, either with or without 500 μm l-glutamate or l-serine. After each experiment with substrate application, the substrate was washed out by perfusion with substrate-free solution and consequently at least once applied again. Cells were only incorporated into the analysis if current amplitudes measured at different times with the same substrate concentration perfectly superimpose. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2, E–G, the application order was changed from experiment to experiment. Transient transfection of subconfluent human embryonic kidney cell cultures with the calcium phosphate-mediated transfection method and laser pulse photolysis experiments were performed as described previously (26Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological recordings were performed 24 h after the transfection for 3 days. In these experiments, the extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaMES, 2 mm CaMES2, 2 mm MgMES2, and 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.4/NaOH). The pipette solution contained 140 mm NaMES (exchange transport current)/NaSCN (exchange anion current), 2 mm MgMES2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm glutamate and serine, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4/NaOH). Briefly, glutamate or 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged glutamate (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO) was applied to cells by means of a small quartz tube (350-μm diameter) with a mean velocity of 5 cm/s and a time resolution of 20–30 ms (10–90% rise time with whole cells). Photolysis of caged glutamate was initiated with a light flash (355 nm, 5 ns, frequency-tripled NdYag laser; Continuum, Santa Clara, CA), which was delivered to the cell with an optical fiber (350-μm diameter). Laser energies were varied in the range of 50–450 mJ/cm2 with neutral density filters. To estimate the concentration of photolytically released glutamate, a standard glutamate concentration of 100 μm was applied to the cells by rapid perfusion before and after photolysis experiments, and the steady-state current amplitude was used to calculate the free glutamate concentration from the dose-response curve (26Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Current responses to the laser pulse were low pass-filtered at 3 kHz (100-μs time resolution) and recorded with a 100-kHz sampling rate. Data were analyzed with a combination of pClamp9 (Molecular Devices) and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) programs. Current amplitudes were used without applying a subtraction procedure. Current-voltage relationships at various substrate concentrations were constructed by plotting isochronal current amplitudes determined 1 ms after the voltage step versus the membrane potential. To obtain the concentration dependence of anion channel activation by Na+ and glutamate, isochronal anion current amplitudes were measured at various concentrations at a given test potential. The so-obtained substrate dependences were normalized to the maximum current amplitude, fit with Hill equations, (I=Imax[substrate]n[substrate]n+KDn+I0)(Eq. 1) and averaged after normalization to the maximum current amplitude (Imax + Io). All data are given as means ± S.E. For statistic evaluation the Student's t test was used. MDCKII cells were transiently transfected with mCFP-hEAAT3, mYFP-rEAAT4, barttin-YFP, or hSLC26A9-mYFP and grown on Ibidi glass-bottom dishes. Additionally, co-transfections of CFP-hEAAT3/YFP-rEAAT4 and GFP-hEAAT3/mCherry-hEAAT2 were performed (see Fig. 5). Confocal imaging was carried out on living cells with a TCS SP2 AOBS scan head and an inverted Leica DM IRB. CFP was excited at 405 nm, and the emission was detected after filtering with a 450–505 nm bandpass filter. YFP/GFP/mCherry were excited at 514 nm/488 nm/514 nm, and the emission was detected after filtering with 520–580 nm/500–535 nm/555–700 nm bandpass filters, respectively. Cell surface expression of hEAAT3 was assayed with a modification of cell surface biotinylation methods described previously (27Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Janssen A.G. Scholl U. Domeyer C. Nothmann D. Leinenweber A. Fahlke Ch. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In these experiments, hEAAT3 was expressed as a GFP fusion protein because the fluorescence scanner (Typhoon) had preferable imaging capabilities for GFP. GFP-hEAAT3 alone or GFP-tagged hEAAT3 together with untagged rEAAT4 or hEAAT2 was expressed in MDCKII cells, grown until 70% confluence on filters (see Fig. 6), and incubated with 2 mg/ml biotin (sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin; Pierce) in triethanolamine buffer (2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm C6H15NO3, pH 7.5) for 1–2 h, either added to the apical or to the basolateral side. The membrane domain that was not treated with biotin was incubated with biotinylation buffer only. The reaction was quenched by repeated washing with quenching buffer (100 mm glycine in PBS). After washing with PBS, the cells were scraped in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and transferred to a tube. After 15 min on ice, they were centrifuged at 14,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell lysate was collected. Cell lysates were incubated with Ultralink immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) for 2 h. After washing with either lysis buffer or high salt wash buffer (0.1% Triton, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), proteins on the beads were released by incubation with SDS loading buffer containing 200 mm DTT and 4.1% SDS. The proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gradient gels. Fluorescence intensities of apical/basolateral channels were determined by fluorescence scanning and given as fraction of the total surface transporter fluorescence, obtained by adding apical and basolateral fluorescence intensities. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene (Bio-Rad), and actin was visualized with rabbit anti-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-rabbit Cy5 antibody (GE Healthcare). Results were used only from experiments in which no actin was detected in purified membrane fractions. We used heterologously expressed hSLC26A9-YFP as apical (29Lohi H. Kujala M. Makela S. Lehtonen E. Kestila M. Saarialho-Kere U. Markovich D. Kere J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14246-14254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase as basolateral markers (27Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated hSLC26A9-YFP was quantified using fluorescent scanning, but we used antibodies (Abcam) and Western blotting for endogenous Na+,K+-ATPases. To study whether different EAAT isoforms assemble into heterotrimeric complexes, we co-expressed two different EAAT isoforms in mammalian cells, one as a YFP fusion protein and the other as a His fusion protein. The tested mammalian EAATs acquire different molecular masses by the distinct added tags and can, thus, be distinguished by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A). Transporters were either purified in their native multimeric state by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-based affinity chromatography before gel electrophoresis (eluate fractions) or resolved as full lysates by denaturing SDS- or BN-PAGE (homogenate fractions). YFP-tagged proteins were then visualized by scanning the wet polyacrylamide gels with a fluorescence scanner. Fig. 1B shows a BN-PAGE from cells co-expressing His-hEAAT3 and YFP-rEAAT4 (lanes 3 and 4) and from cells expressing each transporter alone (lanes 1 and 2). Because His-hEAAT3 homotrimers are not fluorescent, we verified expression of His-hEAAT3 by Western blotting. BN-PAGE of full lysates from cells expressing YFP-rEAAT4 resulted in two different fluorescent bands that correlate to non- or core-glycosylated and complex-glycosylated forms of homotrimers (Fig. 1B, lane 2) (14Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The full homogenate of cells co-transfected with both transporters also contains homotrimeric YFP-rEAAT4 (Fig. 1B, lane 3). After Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-based affinity chromatography, homotrimeric YFP-rEAAT4, which lacks an affinity tag, is absent from the retained fraction. The protein fraction with the highest molecular mass must represent heterotrimers because it contains the His tag, which is only present in His-hEAAT3, exhibits fluorescence from YFP-rEAAT4, and is of a smaller molecular mass than the YFP-rEAAT4 homotrimer (Fig. 1B, lane 4, Eluate). Fig. 1C shows a SDS-PAGE of various fractions isolated from affinity chromatography. Homotrimeric YFP-rEAAT4 does not bind the Ni2+ resin and appears completely in the flow-through (lanes 1–3). In contrast, heterotrimerization of hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 allows pulldown of YFP-rEAAT4 together with His-hEAAT3 by metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 1C, lanes 4–6). We used human EAAT3 and rat EAAT4 for these experiments because functional properties of these isoforms were recently studied and compared by our group (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although human and rat EAAT3 are highly conserved, they do not exhibit complete sequence identity. To demonstrate that EAAT3/EAAT4 hetero-oligomerization also occurs with isoforms from the same species, we repeated co-expression and pulldown experiments with His-rEAAT3 and YFP-rEAAT4. The outcome of these experiments closely resembled those with hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 (data not shown). YFP-rEAAT4 and His-rEAAT3 form heterotrimers. We conclude that EAAT3 and EAAT4 can co-assemble into heteromultimers. Other isoforms fail to co-assemble (Fig. 1, D and E). Neither BN-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1D) nor pulldown assays (Fig. 1E) revealed any indication for hetero-oligomerization for three other EAAT isoform combinations, the two glial transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 as well as for EAAT2 and EAAT3. hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 differ in the unitary glutamate transport rate (30Mim C. Balani P. Rauen T. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) but not in the unitary anion current (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Moreover, macroscopic anion currents display isoform-specific time and voltage dependences (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). hEAAT3/rEAAT4 heterotrimers therefore provide an excellent possibility to study potential intersubunit interactions. To separate currents conducted by hEAAT3 or rEAAT4 subunits, we mutated rEAAT4 at position 501 (R501C) to modify the substrate binding pocket in a way that glutamate cannot bind anymore, but serine or cysteine can bind instead (17Grewer C. Balani P. Weidenfeller C. Bartusel T. Tao Z. Rauen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke C. J.

Fig. 2 shows current recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing either WT hEAAT3 or R501C rEAAT4 alone, or co-expressing both isoforms. In the presence of extracellular NO3− these currents are dominated at positive membrane potentials by the anion component (8Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J.

When the membrane potential is stepped to more positive values, WT hEAAT3 currents display time- and voltage-dependent increases (Fig. 2A, arrow), likely due to channel activation (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast R501C rEAAT4, like WT rEAAT4, is inactivated by positive voltages (Fig. 2B) (8Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke C. J.

Chem. 2010; 285: 23676-23686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). WT hEAAT3 currents are greatly increased in the presence of extracellular glutamate, but are not responsive to serine (Fig. 2A). In contrast, R501C rEAAT4 currents are not significantly affected by glutamate, but they are augmented by application of extracellular serine (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2, C and D, shows the time course of the development of glutamate- and serine-dependent currents with time after mRNA injection. Serine-dependent anion currents are larger in oocytes co-expressing WT hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 than in those expressing R501C rEAAT4 alone (Fig. 2D), indicating that hEAAT3 stimulates the insertion of rEAAT4 subunits into the surface membrane. Confocal images from oocytes expressing YFP-rEAAT4 alone or co-expressing YFP-rEAAT4 and untagged hEAAT3 revealed increased surface insertion of YFP-rEAAT4 in the presence of hEAAT3 (data not shown). In contrast, expression of R501C rEAAT4 did not increase glutamate-dependent hEAAT3 anion currents, but rather decrease this current amplitude at certain time intervals (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2E shows representative recordings from a single co-injected oocyte and the corresponding analysis. Currents were measured in the absence as well as in the presence of glutamate and serine. For the application of each substrate alone as well as for the simultaneous application of both, we determined substrate-dependent current amplitudes for various voltages and constructed current-voltage relationships from these data (Fig. 2F). Current increases elicited by the simultaneous presence of glutamate and serine were slightly smaller than the sums of the current amplitudes induced by only one substrate at positive potentials (Fig. 2G). At negative potentials, where current amplitudes are dominated by coupled transport currents, no difference between the two amplitudes could be observed (Fig. 2G). WT hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 differ in the apparent dissociation constants for glutamate/serine and sodium (25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34719-34726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Mim C. Balani P. Rauen T. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To test whether binding of an amino acid substrate/cation to one subunit is affected by the neighboring subunit, we determined glutamate concentration dependences of hEAAT3 anion currents when expressed alone or co-expressed together with R501C rEAAT4 in oocytes (Fig. 3A), or serine concentration dependences of R501C rEAAT4 currents either expressed alone or co-expressed with WT hEAAT3 (Fig. 3B). No differences in the apparent dissociation constants were observed. Moreover, the serine concentration dependence was not affected when co-applied with a saturating concentration of glutamate (Fig. 3, C and D), a condition in which the hEAAT3 is expected to be predominantly in the inward-facing, but not in the outward-facing configuration. At saturating glutamate (Fig. 3E) or serine concentrations (Fig. 3F), WT hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 differ significantly in the apparent dissociation constants for sodium, with R501C rEAAT4 showing significantly higher apparent affinity. However, co-expression of the two transporters does not modify sodium binding (Fig. 3, E and F). To test for potential subunit interactions during coupled substrate transport, we employed heterologous expression in mammalian cells and rapid application of glutamate with subsequent analysis of the relaxation of the transport-associated currents. This approach allows the resolution of early conformational changes in glutamate transporters (Fig. 4). Because homotrimeric R501C rEAAT4s are insensitive to glutamate, differences in current responses of cells co-expressing WT hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 from cells expressing hEAAT3 alone will indicate modification of the function of hEAAT3 by adjacent rEAAT4 subunits. We performed these experiments under two different intracellular ionic conditions, i.e. with MES− or with SCN− as the predominant intracellular anion. In both types of experiments, intracellular K+ was replaced by Na+, eliminating the relocation of the K+-bound transporter. With internal MES−, there are no contributions of EAAT anion channels, and currents reflect conformational changes in the Na+/glutamate homoexchange mode (33Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, A and B). SCN− represents the anion with highest permeability through the EAAT anion pore (8Melzer N. Biela A. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Torres-Salazar D. Fahlke Ch. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in cells dialyzed with internal SCN−, currents at negative potentials are dominated by EAAT-mediated anion currents. Two kinetic components of the current signal in response to glutamate application are observed in hEAAT3-expressing cells, a fast component due to Na+ binding and a conformational change subsequent to the association of glutamate with the transporter (35Mim C. Tao Z. Grewer C. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 9007-9018Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and a slow component representing the translocation of Na+ and glutamate (26Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Homo- and heterotrimeric transporters display identical time constants and relative amplitudes of the two kinetic components (Fig. 4B). The two kinetic processes can also be observed in the presence of internal SCN−. In this case, sudden increases of the external glutamate concentration result in a biexponential activation of hEAAT3 anion channels with the same time constants as observed in the absence of permeant anions (Fig. 4, C and D). Serine activates R501C rEAAT4 anion channels and thus increases the current amplitude in cells expressing heterotrimers in the presence of internal SCN−. However, the rate constants of current activation were not affected by the co-expression of R501C rEAAT4, either in the absence or in the presence of serine (Fig. 4, E and F). We conclude that, within heterotrimeric assemblies, individual EAAT subunits bind and transport amino acid substrates and sodium ions independently of each other. EAAT3 exhibits a unique sorting signal that targets transporters to the apical membrane of epithelial cells and into neuronal dendrites (27Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT4 lack this signal and are therefore distributed differently in MDCK cells than hEAAT3 (27Cheng C. Glover G. Banker G. Amara S.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10643-10652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We used co-expression of fluorescent protein-tagged hEAAT3 and rEAAT4, confocal imaging (Fig. 5) and surface biotinylation (Fig. 6) to study whether heterotrimerization affects epithelial sorting. We first performed confocal imaging in confluent monolayers to study alteration of epithelial sorting (Fig. 5). Whereas CFP-hEAAT3 alone is predominantly inserted into the apical dome (Fig. 5A), YFP-rEAAT4 is visible in the apical and in the basolateral membranes (Fig. 5B). We used barttin as basolateral (28Janssen A.G. Scholl U. Domeyer C. Nothmann D. Leinenweber A. Fahlke Ch. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2009; 20: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 36Estévez R. Boettger T. Stein V. Birkenhäger R. Otto E. Hildebrandt F. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2001; 414: 558-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5C) and SLC26A9 as apical marker (Fig. 5D) (29Lohi H. Kujala M. Makela S. Lehtonen E. Kestila M. Saarialho-Kere U. Markovich D. Kere J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14246-14254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of CFP-hEAAT3 and YFP-rEAAT4 results in the appearance of hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 in apical as well as in basolateral (arrows) domains (Fig. 5E). As expected for hetero-oligomerizing subunits, YFP and CFP fluorescence co-localizes. In contrast, co-transfection of GFP-hEAAT3 with mCherry-hEAAT2 that does not result in the formation of heterotrimers (Fig. 1) fails to route hEAAT3 to the basolateral domain (Fig. 5F, arrows). To quantify this alteration of epithelial sorting, we performed surface biotinylation in confluent monolayers of MDCK cells grown on filters (Fig. 6). Fig. 6A displays the fluorescent scan of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel with purified membrane-inserted GFP-hEAAT3 after biotin application to the apical or the basolateral site of cells expressing GFP-hEAAT3 alone or co-expressing GFP-hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 or hEAAT2. In all cases, the majority of biotinylated EAAT3 protein is complex-glycosylated. Endogenous Na+,K+-ATPase and hSLC26A9-YFP were used as basolateral or apical controls. Fig. 6B shows the relative amounts of biotinylated GFP-hEAAT3 after biotin application to the apical or the basolateral site, when expressed alone or co-expressed with nonfluorescent rEAAT4. Whereas hEAAT3 homotrimers preferentially inserts into the apical membrane, heterotrimerization results in equal distribution of hEAAT3 in the apical and the basolateral membrane. Co-expression with hEAAT2 does not modify the polarized expression of hEAAT3 (Fig. 6C). We conclude that hEAAT3 is targeted to distinct regions as homotrimer or as a hEAAT3/rEAAT4 heterotrimer. We here demonstrate that EAAT3 and EAAT4, but neither EAAT1 and EAAT2 nor EAAT2 and EAAT3, co-assemble into stable heterotrimers in heterologous expression systems. EAAT3 and EAAT4 co-express in several cell types of the mammalian brain (37Furuta A. Rothstein J.D. Martin L.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8363-8375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Furuta A. Martin L.J. Lin C.L. Dykes-Hoberg M. Rothstein J.D. Neuroscience. 1997; 81: 1031-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), and heterotrimers might, thus, represent a significant portion of the native transporters. BN-PAGE demonstrates the existence of stable heterotrimers, providing compelling evidence for a direct interaction of EAAT3 and EAAT4 (Fig. 1). There are no indications for dimers and monomers or for higher order oligomers, i.e. the linkage of two trimers via interacting proteins. Recent reports have demonstrated that co-expression of WT and mutant EAAT subunits results in a superposition of WT and mutant glutamate transport and anion currents, in full agreement with functionally independent subunits (17Grewer C. Balani P. Weidenfeller C. Bartusel T. Tao Z. Rauen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 18Leary G.P. Stone E.F. Holley D.C. Kavanaugh M.P. J.

We extended these studies by measuring substrate dependences (Fig. 3) as well as early conformational changes (Fig. 4) in heterotrimeric glutamate transporters. Our results support the idea that individual subunits function independently within the hetero-oligomeric assembly. The substrate concentration dependences of hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 anion currents are similar in homo- and in heterotrimeric assemblies (Fig. 3). Pre-steady-state kinetics of hEAAT3 are unaffected by the presence of R501C rEAAT4 in the heteromultimer (Fig. 4). Co-expression of hEAAT3 and serine-sensitive R501C rEAAT4 results in uptake currents that are identical to the superposition of currents mediated by hEAAT3 and R501C rEAAT4 (Fig. 2G). For EAAT-associated anion currents, we observed slight deviations from the expectations of complete independence of individual subunits (Fig. 2G). Structural evidence from the bacterial EAAT homolog GltPh (39Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) suggested that substrate transport requires a major conformational change. Comparison of high resolution structures of GltPh in the outward-facing (15Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar) and in the inward-facing conformation (39Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) demonstrated a largely immobile “trimerization domain” (containing TM1, TM2, TM4, and TM5) and a “transport domain” undergoing substantial movements during the glutamate transport process (39Reyes N. Ginter C. Boudker O. Nature. 2009; 462: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This transport mechanism requires trimerization for normal transport and suggests that monomeric GltPh subunits might be unable to transport, in contrast to other multimeric transporter families (40Robertson J.L. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. Nature. 2010; 468: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The apparent independence of EAAT subunits indicates that any transmission of conformational changes to other subunits through the trimerization domain may be minor. Neither the glial transporters EAAT1 and EAAT2 nor EAAT2 and EAAT3 or EAAT2 and EAAT4 have the ability to co-assemble (Fig. 1). Heterotrimerization is, therefore, not a common feature of different EAAT isoforms. At present, we can only speculate about the biological significance of the hetero-oligomerization of EAAT3 and EAAT4. EAAT3 and EAAT4 are co-expressed in certain neurons of the central nervous system. Cooperation of different targeting signals might result in the insertion of heteromultimers in cell regions that exclude homotrimers. Heterotrimerization results in close proximity of low affinity/high capacity (EAAT3) and high affinity/low capacity (EAAT4) transporter (30Mim C. Balani P. Rauen T. Grewer C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2005; 126: 571-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), allowing tight regulation of the external glutamate concentration. Because EAAT anion channels possibly modulate neuronal excitability (2Amara S.G. Fontana A.C. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 11Melzer N.

https://openalex.org/W2164294663,"Background Breakdown of the gut mucosal barrier during chronic HIV infection allows translocation of bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from the gut into the circulation. Microbial translocation also occurs in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD serological markers are useful in the diagnosis of IBD and to differentiate between Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Here, we evaluate detection of IBD serological markers in HIV-infected patients with advanced disease and their relationship to HIV disease markers. Methods IBD serological markers (ASCA, pANCA, anti-OmpC, and anti-CBir1) were measured by ELISA in plasma from AIDS patients (n = 26) with low CD4 counts (<300 cells/µl) and high plasma LPS levels, and results correlated with clinical data. For meta-analysis, relevant data were abstracted from 20 articles. Results IBD serological markers were detected in approximately 65% of AIDS patients with evidence of microbial translocation. An antibody pattern consistent with IBD was detected in 46%; of these, 75% had a CD-like pattern. Meta-analysis of data from 20 published studies on IBD serological markers in CD, UC, and non-IBD control subjects indicated that IBD serological markers are detected more frequently in AIDS patients than in non-IBD disease controls and healthy controls, but less frequently than in CD patients. There was no association between IBD serological markers and HIV disease markers (plasma viral load and CD4 counts) in the study cohort. Conclusions IBD serological markers may provide a non-invasive approach to monitor HIV-related inflammatory gut disease. Further studies to investigate their clinical significance in HIV-infected individuals are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2070604167,"Background Cortical neurons implement a high frequency-specific modulation of subcortical nuclei that includes the cochlear nucleus. Anatomical studies show that corticofugal fibers terminating in the auditory thalamus and midbrain are mostly ipsilateral. Differently, corticofugal fibers terminating in the cochlear nucleus are bilateral, which fits to the needs of binaural hearing that improves hearing quality. This leads to our hypothesis that corticofugal modulation of initial neural processing of sound information from the contralateral and ipsilateral ears could be equivalent or coordinated at the first sound processing level. Methodology/Principal Findings With the focal electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex and single unit recording, this study examined corticofugal modulation of the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus. The same methods and procedures as described in our previous study of corticofugal modulation of contralateral cochlear nucleus were employed simply for comparison. We found that focal electrical stimulation of cortical neurons induced substantial changes in the response magnitude, response latency and receptive field of ipsilateral cochlear nucleus neurons. Cortical stimulation facilitated auditory response and shortened the response latency of physiologically matched neurons whereas it inhibited auditory response and lengthened the response latency of unmatched neurons. Finally, cortical stimulation shifted the best frequencies of cochlear neurons towards those of stimulated cortical neurons. Conclusion Our data suggest that cortical neurons enable a high frequency-specific remodelling of sound information processing in the ipsilateral cochlear nucleus in the same manner as that in the contralateral cochlear nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2080802606,"Background The formation of the cell wall in Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires the coordinated activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis and modification of β-glucans. The β(1,3)-glucan synthase complex synthesizes linear β(1,3)-glucans, which remain unorganized until they are cross-linked to other β(1,3)-glucans and other cell wall components. Transferases of the GH72 family play important roles in cell wall assembly and its rearrangement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus fumigatus. Four genes encoding β(1,3)-glucanosyl-transferases -gas1+, gas2+, gas4+ and gas5+- are present in S. pombe, although their function has not been analyzed. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we report the characterization of the catalytic activity of gas1p, gas2p and gas5p together with studies directed to understand their function during vegetative growth. From the functional point of view, gas1p is essential for cell integrity and viability during vegetative growth, since gas1Δ mutants can only grow in osmotically supported media, while gas2p and gas5p play a minor role in cell wall construction. From the biochemical point of view, all of them display β(1,3)-glucanosyl-transferase activity, although they differ in their specificity for substrate length, cleavage point and product size. In light of all the above, together with the differences in expression profiles during the life cycle, the S. pombe GH72 proteins may accomplish complementary, non-overlapping functions in fission yeast. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that β(1,3)-glucanosyl-transferase activity is essential for viability in fission yeast, being required to maintain cell integrity during vegetative growth."

Genetic studies with replications in non-diabetic individuals in regard to their fat distribution or insulin resistance according to their carrier status of a common toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) variant (TLR4(D299G/T399I)) are still lacking.We performed a cross-sectional analysis in individuals phenotyped for prediabetic traits as body fat composition (including magnetic resonance imaging), blood glucose levels and insulin resistance (oral glucose tolerance testing, euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp), according to TLR4 genotype determined by candidate SNP analyses (rs4986790). We analyzed N = 1482 non-diabetic individuals from the TÜF/TULIP cohort (South Germany, aged 39±13 y, BMI 28.5±7.9, mean±SD) and N = 5327 non-diabetic participants of the METSIM study (Finland, males aged 58±6 y, BMI 26.8±3.8) for replication purposes. German TLR4(D299G/T399I) carriers had a significantly increased body fat (XG in rs4986790: +6.98%, p = 0.03, dominant model, adjusted for age, gender) and decreased insulin sensitivity (XG: -15.3%, Matsuda model, p = 0.04; XG: -20.6%, p = 0.016, clamp; both dominant models adjusted for age, gender, body fat). In addition, both liver fat (AG: +49.7%; p = 0.002) and visceral adipose tissue (AG: +8.2%; p = 0.047, both adjusted for age, gender, body fat) were significantly increased in rs4986790 minor allele carriers, and the effect on liver fat remained significant also after additional adjustment for visceral fat (p = 0.014). The analysis in METSIM confirmed increased body fat content in association with the rare G allele in rs4986790 (AG: +1.26%, GG: +11.0%; p = 0.010, additive model, adjusted for age) and showed a non-significant trend towards decreased insulin sensitivity (AG: -0.99%, GG: -10.62%).TLR4(D299G/T399I) associates with increased total body fat, visceral fat, liver fat and decreased insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic Caucasians and may contribute to diabetes risk. This finding supports the role of TLR4 as a molecular link between obesity and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2100099113,"Breast tumors consist of several different tissue components. Despite the heterogeneity, most gene expression analyses have traditionally been performed without prior microdissection of the tissue sample. Thus, the gene expression profiles obtained reflect the mRNA contribution from the various tissue components. We utilized histopathological estimations of area fractions of tumor and stromal tissue components in 198 fresh-frozen breast tumor tissue samples for a cell type-associated gene expression analysis associated with distant metastasis. Sets of differentially expressed gene-probes were identified in tumors from patients who developed distant metastasis compared with those who did not, by weighing the contribution from each tumor with the relative content of stromal and tumor epithelial cells in their individual tumor specimen. The analyses were performed under various assumptions of mRNA transcription level from tumor epithelial cells compared with stromal cells. A set of 30 differentially expressed gene-probes was ascribed solely to carcinoma cells. Furthermore, two sets of 38 and five differentially expressed gene-probes were mostly associated to tumor epithelial and stromal cells, respectively. Finally, a set of 26 differentially expressed gene-probes was identified independently of cell type focus. The differentially expressed genes were validated in independent gene expression data from a set of laser capture microdissected invasive ductal carcinomas. We present a method for identifying and ascribing differentially expressed genes to tumor epithelial and/or stromal cells, by utilizing pathologic information and weighted t-statistics. Although a transcriptional contribution from the stromal cell fraction is detectable in microarray experiments performed on bulk tumor, the gene expression differences between the distant metastasis and no distant metastasis group were mostly ascribed to the tumor epithelial cells of the primary breast tumors. However, the gene PIP5K2A was found significantly elevated in stroma cells in distant metastasis group, compared to stroma in no distant metastasis group. These findings were confirmed in gene expression data from the representative compartments from microdissected breast tissue. The method described was also found to be robust to different histopathological procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2026643510,"Tailed bacteriophages use powerful molecular motors to package the viral genome into a preformed capsid. Packaging at a rate of up to ∼2000 bp/s and generating a power density twice that of an automobile engine, the phage T4 motor is the fastest and most powerful reported to date. Central to DNA packaging are dynamic interactions among the packaging components, capsid (gp23), portal (gp20), motor (gp17, large ""terminase""), and regulator (gp16, small terminase), leading to precise orchestration of the packaging process, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we analyzed the interactions between small and large terminases of T4-related phages. Our results show that the gp17 packaging ATPase is maximally stimulated by homologous, but not heterologous, gp16. Multiple interaction sites are identified in both gp16 and gp17. The specificity determinants in gp16 are clustered in the diverged N- and C-terminal domains (regions I-III). Swapping of diverged region(s), such as replacing C-terminal RB49 region III with that of T4, switched ATPase stimulation specificity. Two specificity regions, amino acids 37-52 and 290-315, are identified in or near the gp17-ATPase ""transmission"" subdomain II. gp16 binding at these sites might cause a conformational change positioning the ATPase-coupling residues into the catalytic pocket, triggering ATP hydrolysis. These results lead to a model in which multiple weak interactions between motor and regulator allow dynamic assembly and disassembly of various packaging complexes, depending on the functional state of the packaging machine. This might be a general mechanism for regulation of the phage packaging machine and other complex molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W1996441366,"Stp1 and Stp2 are two homologous transcription factors activated in response to extracellular amino acid stimuli. Here we show that both ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Stp1 and Stp2 and their intracellular localization are differentially regulated. We have found that the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 is required for degradation of both full-length and processed Stp1, but not Stp2. We have also found that Grr1, the F-box component of the SCF(Grr1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the primary factor in degradation of full-length Stp1, whereas both Grr1 and Cdc4 are required for degradation of processed Stp1. Our localization studies showed that full-length Stp1 is localized both in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery, whereas full-length Stp2 is localized only diffusely in the cytoplasm. We identified two nuclear localization signals of Stp1 and found that the N-terminal domain of Stp1 is required for localization of full-length Stp1 to the cell periphery. We also found that Stp2 is the primary factor involved in basal activation of target gene expression. Our results indicate that the functions of two seemingly redundant transcription factors can be separated by differential degradation and distinct cellular localization."
https://openalex.org/W2017865531,"Our ability to monitor populations or species that were once threatened or endangered and in the process of recovery is enhanced by using genetic methods to assess overall population stability and size over time. This can be accomplished most directly by obtaining genetic measures from temporally-spaced samples that reflect the overall stability of the population as given by changes in genetic diversity levels (allelic richness and heterozygosity), degree of population differentiation (F(ST) and D(EST)), and effective population size (N(e)). The primary goal of any recovery effort is to produce a long-term self-sustaining population, and these genetic measures provide a metric by which we can gauge our progress and help make important management decisions.The peregrine falcon in North America (Falco peregrinus tundrius and anatum) was delisted in 1994 and 1999, respectively, and its abundance will be monitored by the species Recovery Team every three years until 2015. Although the United States Fish and Wildlife Service makes a distinction between tundrius and anatum subspecies, our genetic results based on eleven microsatellite loci suggest limited differentiation that can be attributed to an isolation by distance relationship and warrant no delineation of these two subspecies in its northern latitudinal distribution from Alaska through Canada into Greenland. Using temporal samples collected at Padre Island, Texas during migration (seven temporal time periods between 1985-2007), no significant differences in genetic diversity or significant population differentiation in allele frequencies between time periods were observed and were indistinguishable from those obtained from tundrius/anatum breeding locations throughout their northern distribution. Estimates of harmonic mean N(e) were variable and imprecise, but always greater than 500 when employing multiple temporal genetic methods.These results, including those from simulations to assess the power of each method to estimate N(e), suggest a stable or growing population, which is consistent with ongoing field-based monitoring surveys. Therefore, historic and continuing efforts to prevent the extinction of the peregrine falcon in North America appear successful with no indication of recent decline, at least from the northern latitude range-wide perspective. The results also further highlight the importance of archiving samples and their use for continual assessment of population recovery and long-term viability."
https://openalex.org/W2130579095,"Although histone deacetylases (HDACs) are normally considered as co-repressors, HDAC1 has been identified as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (Qiu, Y., Zhao, Y., Becker, M., John, S., Parekh, B. S., Huang, S., Hendarwanto, A., Martinez, E. D., Chen, Y., Lu, H., Adkins, N. L., Stavreva, D. A., Wiench, M., Georgel, P. T., Schiltz, R. L., and Hager, G. L. (2006) Mol. Cell 22, 669-679). Furthermore, HDAC1 is acetylated, and its acetylation level is linked to the transcription state of a GR-induced promoter (mouse mammary tumor virus). GR is also known to interact dynamically with regulatory elements in living cells (McNally, J. G., Müller, W. G., Walker, D., Wolford, R., and Hager, G. L. (2000) Science 287, 1262-1265). However, HDAC1 dynamics have never been studied. We demonstrate here that HDAC1 also exchanges rapidly with promoter chromatin, and its exchange rate is significantly modulated during the development of promoter activity. Prior to induction, HDAC1 mobility was retarded compared with the exchange rate for GR. HDAC1 mobility then increased substantially, coordinately with the peak of promoter activity. At later time points, promoter activity was severely repressed, and HDAC1 mobility returned to the rate of exchange observed for the uninduced promoter. Thus, alterations of the exchange rates of HDAC1 at the promoter are correlated with the activity state of the promoter. These findings provide direct evidence for the functional role of highly mobile transcription factor complexes in transcription regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2112659042,"The Svalbard rock ptarmigan, Lagopus muta hyperborea experiences extreme photoperiodic and climatic conditions on the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. This species, however, is highly adapted to live in this harsh environment. One of the most striking adaptations found in these birds is the deposition, prior to onset of winter, of fat stores which may comprise up to 32% of body mass and are located primarily around the sternum and abdominal region. This fat, while crucial to the birds' survival, also presents a challenge in that the bird must maintain normal physiological function with this additional mass. In particular these stores are likely to constrain the respiratory system, as the sternum and pelvic region must be moved during ventilation and carrying this extra load may also impact upon the energetic cost of locomotion. Here we demonstrate that winter birds have a reduced cost of locomotion when compared to summer birds. A remarkable finding given that during winter these birds have almost twice the body mass of those in summer. These results suggest that Svalbard ptarmigan are able to carry the additional winter fat without incurring any energetic cost. As energy conservation is paramount to these birds, minimising the costs of moving around when resources are limited would appear to be a key adaptation crucial for their survival in the barren Arctic environment."

We hypothesized that levulinate is converted in the liver to 4-hydroxypentanoate, a new drug of abuse, and that this conversion is accelerated by ethanol oxidation. We confirmed these hypotheses in live rats, perfused rat livers, and liver subcellular preparations. Levulinate is reduced to (R)-4-hydroxypentanoate by a cytosolic and a mitochondrial dehydrogenase, which are NADPH- and NADH-dependent, respectively.

In livers perfused with [13C5]levulinate, there was substantial CoA trapping in levulinyl-CoA, 4-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, and 4-phosphopentanoyl-CoA. This CoA trapping was increased by ethanol, with a 6-fold increase in the concentration of 4-phosphopentanoyl-CoA. Levulinate is catabolized by 3 parallel pathways to propionyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and lactate. Most intermediates of the 3 pathways were identified by mass isotopomer analysis and metabolomics.

Levulinate is reduced to (R)-4-hydroxypentanoate by a cytosolic and a mitochondrial dehydrogenase, which are NADPH- and NADH-dependent, respectively. A mitochondrial dehydrogenase or racemase system also forms (S)-4-hydroxypentanoate. In livers perfused with [13C5]levulinate, there was substantial CoA trapping in levulinyl-CoA, 4-hydroxypentanoyl-CoA, and 4-phosphopentanoyl-CoA. This CoA trapping was increased by ethanol, with a 6-fold increase in the concentration of 4-phosphopentanoyl-CoA. Levulinate is catabolized by 3 parallel pathways to propionyl-CoA, acetyl-CoA, and lactate. Most intermediates of the 3 pathways were identified by mass isotopomer analysis and metabolomics. The production of 4-hydroxypentanoate from levulinate and its stimulation by ethanol is a potential public health concern."
https://openalex.org/W2112267796,"ECS (Elongin BC-Cul2/Cul5-SOCS-box protein) ubiquitin ligases recruit substrates to E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes through a SOCS-box protein substrate receptor, an Elongin BC adaptor and a cullin (Cul2 or Cul5) scaffold which interacts with the RING protein. In vitro studies have shown that the conserved amino acid sequence of the cullin box in SOCS-box proteins is required for complex formation and function. However, the in vivo importance of cullin boxes has not been addressed. To explore the biological functions of the cullin box domain of ankyrin repeat and SOCS-box containing protein 11 (d-Asb11), a key mediator of canonical Delta-Notch signaling, we isolated a zebrafish mutant lacking the Cul5 box (Asb11(Cul)). We found that homozygous zebrafish mutants for this allele were defective in Notch signaling as indicated by the impaired expression of Notch target genes. Importantly, asb11(Cul) fish were not capable to degrade the Notch ligand DeltaA during embryogenesis, a process essential for the initiation of Notch signaling during neurogenesis. Accordingly, proper cell fate specification within the neurogenic regions of the zebrafish embryo was impaired. In addition, Asb11(Cul) mRNA was defective in the ability to transactivate a her4::gfp reporter DNA when injected in embryos. Thus, our study reporting the generation and the characterization of a metazoan organism mutant in the conserved cullin binding domain of the SOCS-box demonstrates a hitherto unrecognized importance of the SOCS-box domain for the function of this class of cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases and establishes that the d-Asb11 cullin box is required for both canonical Notch signaling and proper neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2135214379,"Background Gamma-aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors decrease neural activity through G protein signaling. There are two subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2. Alternative splicing provides GABAB1 with structural and functional diversity. cDNA microarrays showed strong signals from human brain RNA using GABAB1 intron 4 region probes. Therefore, we predicted the existence of novel splice variants. Methodology/Principal Findings Based on the probe sequence analysis, we proposed two possible splice variants, GABAB1j and GABAB1k. The existence of human GABAB1j was verified by quantitative real-time PCR, and mouse GABAB1j was found from a microarray probe set based on human GABAB1j sequence. GABAB1j open reading frames (ORF) and expression patterns are not conserved across species, and they do not have any important functional domains except sushi domains. Thus, we focused on another possible splice variant, GABAB1k. After obtaining PCR evidence for GABAB1k existence from human, mouse, and rat, it was cloned from human and mouse by PCR along with three additional isoforms, GABAB1l, GABAB1m, and GABAB1n. Their expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR are relatively low in brain although they may be expressed in specific cell types. GABAB1l and GABAB1m inhibit GABAB receptor-induced G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel (GIRK) currents at Xenopus oocyte two-electrode voltage clamp system. Conclusions/Significance This study supports previous suggestions that intron 4 of GABAB1 gene is a frequent splicing spot across species. Like GABAB1e, GABAB1l and GABAB1m do not have transmembrane domains but have a dimerization motif. So, they also could be secreted and bind GABAB2 dominantly instead of GABAB1a. However, only GABAB1l and GABAB1m are N- and C-terminal truncated splicing variants and impair receptor function. This suggests that the intron 4 containing N-terminal truncation is necessary for the inhibitory action of the new splice variants."
https://openalex.org/W2147845840,"Using structure-based virtual screening, we previously identified a novel stilbenoid inhibitor of Jak2 tyrosine kinase named G6. Here, we hypothesized that G6 suppresses Jak2-V617F-mediated human pathological cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We found that G6 inhibited proliferation of the Jak2-V617F expressing human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line by promoting marked cell cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis. The G6-dependent increase in apoptosis levels was concomitant with increased caspase 3/7 activity and cleavage of PARP. G6 also selectively inhibited phosphorylation of STAT5, a downstream signaling target of Jak2. Using a mouse model of Jak2-V617F-mediated hyperplasia, we found that G6 significantly decreased the percentage of blast cells in the peripheral blood, reduced splenomegaly, and corrected a pathologically low myeloid to erythroid ratio in the bone marrow by eliminating HEL cell engraftment in this tissue. In addition, drug efficacy correlated with the presence of G6 in the plasma, marrow, and spleen. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the stilbenoid compound, G6, suppresses Jak2-V617F-mediated aberrant cell growth. As such, G6 may be a potential therapeutic lead candidate against Jak2-mediated, human disease."
https://openalex.org/W1973128739,"In contrast to the well-studied continental shelf region of the Gulf of Maine, fundamental questions regarding the diversity, distribution, and abundance of species living in deep-sea habitats along the adjacent continental margin remain unanswered. Lack of such knowledge precludes a greater understanding of the Gulf of Maine ecosystem and limits development of alternatives for conservation and management.We use data from the published literature, unpublished studies, museum records and online sources, to: (1) assess the current state of knowledge of species diversity in the deep-sea habitats adjacent to the Gulf of Maine (39-43°N, 63-71°W, 150-3000 m depth); (2) compare patterns of taxonomic diversity and distribution of megafaunal and macrofaunal species among six distinct sub-regions and to the continental shelf; and (3) estimate the amount of unknown diversity in the region. Known diversity for the deep-sea region is 1,671 species; most are narrowly distributed and known to occur within only one sub-region. The number of species varies by sub-region and is directly related to sampling effort occurring within each. Fishes, corals, decapod crustaceans, molluscs, and echinoderms are relatively well known, while most other taxonomic groups are poorly known. Taxonomic diversity decreases with increasing distance from the continental shelf and with changes in benthic topography. Low similarity in faunal composition suggests the deep-sea region harbours faunal communities distinct from those of the continental shelf. Non-parametric estimators of species richness suggest a minimum of 50% of the deep-sea species inventory remains to be discovered.The current state of knowledge of biodiversity in this deep-sea region is rudimentary. Our ability to answer questions is hampered by a lack of sufficient data for many taxonomic groups, which is constrained by sampling biases, life-history characteristics of target species, and the lack of trained taxonomists."
https://openalex.org/W1971120721,"Nuclear receptors such as the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that mediate transcription of target genes by recruiting factors that modulate chromatin structure. In this study, curcumin, a compound known to inhibit GR-mediated transcription, was used to examine the different mechanisms by which GR regulates transcription. The mechanisms of transcription regulation of metallothioneine-2A (MT2A) and solute carrier family 19 member 2 (SLC19A2), two GR target genes where the hormone-dependent gene activation is inhibited or unaffected by curcumin treatment, respectively, were analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation and RT-PCR experiments.

Signal-induced transcription regulation is an important part of the cellular response to physiological and environmental stimuli. Transcription response to these stimuli can involve the direct association of the signaling molecule to DNA binding transcription factors, which in turn recruit chromatin remodelers, modifiers, and the transcription machinery to target genes. In addition, physiological and environmental stimuli can activate or deactivate cellular signaling pathways that modulate activities of the transcription activators and repressors that lead to changes in expression of their target genes (1Rosenfeld M.G.

Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schütz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

In addition to demonstrating their important roles in these physiological processes, studies of transcription regulation by SHRs have provided invaluable insight into the understanding of the mechanisms of transcription regulation by sequence-specific transcription factors in mammalian cells. Upon ligand binding, SHRs are directed to their hormone response elements located at target genes as dimers. The promoter-bound receptors recruit various coactivators, many of which are chromatin structure- and modification-altering enzymes such as the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and histone acetyltransferases. The activities of these coactivators result in opening of the chromatin architecture at target genes to allow the transcription machinery access to GR target genes. In addition, sequential recruitment of GR and coactivator activities results in transcription activation and stabilization of the open chromatin architecture. GR also aids in the recruitment of the Mediator complex to bridge the communication between GR coactivator activity and the transcription machinery, thereby enhancing the efficiency by which transcription regulation of target genes takes place (6Cheung E.

We have previously used a broad range of steroid hormone antagonists and inhibitors to enhance the understanding of how SHRs regulate promoter chromatin remodeling and recruit the transcription machinery to target genes (10Mymryk J.S.

In our present study, we aimed to further characterize the different mechanisms by which GR targets the assembly of the transcription machinery. To this end, we utilized curcumin, one of several compounds that have been found to inhibit GR-mediated transcription by affecting the phosphorylation status of GR (14Chen W. Dang T. Blind R.D. Wang Z. Cavasotto C.N. Hittelman A.B. Rogatsky I. Logan S.K. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We were interested in investigating the diversity in the manner by which GR-mediated transcription activation takes place by using curcumin as a chemical tool. We monitored transcription output of GR target genes after curcumin treatment in HeLa cells. Curcumin treatment led to the inhibition of most of the GR target genes such as the metallothioneine-2A (MT2A) gene. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that inhibition of GR-mediated transcription occurs without preventing the recruitment of GR to target promoters. Kinetic analysis of transcript accumulation and RNAPII recruitment to MT2A showed that curcumin does not affect the initial recruitment of the RNAPII machinery to MT2A but inhibits the continued transcriptional output of MT2A mRNA. In contrast, analysis of solute carrier family 19 member 2 (SLC19A2), a gene where the hormone-dependent activation of transcription was not affected by the curcumin treatment, demonstrated that curcumin affects the initial accumulation of nascent RNA but that the transcriptional activity above basal level is allowed to continue, and after 4 h of hormone treatment, leads to very little overall difference in the level of transcripts accumulated. These results suggest that the continual transcript output of the two GR target genes examined in this work is differentially regulated at a stage after initial assembly of the transcription machinery.

HeLa cells expressing endogenous GR were treated with 50 μm curcumin or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min followed by 100 nm synthetic glucocorticoid Dex or vehicle (EtOH) for 4 h. After the Dex treatment, cells were harvested, total RNA was collected, and expression levels of known GR target genes were determined by RT-PCR. The analysis revealed that curcumin inhibits Dex-induced transcription of many of the genes tested with the exception of the SLC19A2, ABLIM3, and GADD45B genes (Fig. 1). To identify the mechanism by which curcumin is able to inhibit GR-mediated transcription, we decided to compare and contrast the mechanism of hormone-dependent transcription initiation of the two genes that responded differently to curcumin; the SLC19A2 gene where the hormone-dependent activation of transcription was not affected by curcumin treatment versus MT2A, a gene whose hormone-dependent activation of transcription was inhibited by curcumin (Fig. 1). A series of ChIP analyses was performed to monitor recruitment of factors that are necessary for GR-mediated transcription. First, the recruitment of GR and the Mediator complex (MED1 subunit) was determined. HeLa cells were treated for 30 min with or without 50 μm curcumin followed by 100 nm Dex for 1 h, and the recruitment of GR and MED1 to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE) was monitored by real-time PCR (Fig. 2). Both GR and the Mediator complex are recruited to both the SLC19A2 and the MT2A glucocorticoid response element region in a hormone-dependent manner, and the levels of their association were not affected by curcumin treatment, suggesting that the difference in their mode of transcription regulation is at step/steps downstream of GR and Mediator recruitment. We next sought to determine the effect of curcumin on the recruitment of total RNAPII. The recruitment of total RNAPII to the transcription start site (TSS) region of SLC19A2 and MT2A was assessed after treatment of HeLa cells with curcumin and Dex as described above and in the figure legend (Fig. 3A). The ChIP results show that there is a basal level of RNAPII association near the TSS on both genes in the absence of Dex. These levels were determined to be significantly higher than levels seen at internal locations within the gene (supplemental Fig. 1). However, a Dex-dependent increase in RNAPII recruitment can be observed on the MT2A gene, which is inhibited in the presence of curcumin. Dex-dependent change in RNAPII association near the TSS of SLC19A2 was not observed, and curcumin did not have any consequence on RNAPII levels at this location (Fig. 3A). To ensure that the differences seen in RNAPII association at the TSS are not due to changes in levels of RNAPII in the cell, Western blot analysis of HeLa nuclear extracts treated with curcumin and Dex was performed. The Western blot shows that the levels of RNAPII remain unchanged within the experimental conditions tested and are thus unlikely to influence the level of RNAPII recruited to the TSS of MT2A (Fig. 3B). The results of the RNAPII ChIP experiment support the RT-PCR results that indicate that curcumin inhibited Dex-induced MT2A gene activation while having little impact on the SLC19A2 gene activation (Fig. 1). To further analyze the results of curcumin exposure on the RNAPII machinery assembly, ChIP experiments were conducted using antibodies against the general transcription factors TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIH (p89) after treatment of HeLa cells with curcumin and Dex as indicated in the figure legend (Fig. 4A). Basal levels of TFIIB and TBP could be found near the TSS of both genes prior to hormone treatment. These basal levels were found to be significantly higher than levels found at nonspecific loci away from the TSS (supplemental Fig. 2). Association of TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIH all increased in a hormone-dependent manner near the TSS of the MT2A gene, which was inhibited in the presence of curcumin, similar to what we have observed for RNAPII association at this locus. Neither curcumin nor Dex treatment leads to changes in levels of association of these three factors at the SLC19A2 gene, indicating that curcumin specifically inhibits the hormone-dependent recruitment of the members of the transcriptional machinery. Interestingly, in our ChIP assays, we could not detect the association of TFIIH(p89) at the SLC19A2 TSS under any of the conditions tested. Western blot analysis of the cellular levels of TFIIB, TBP, and TFIIH(p89) shows that they remain unchanged under the experimental condition tested and cannot be attributed to the differences in recruitment of these factors to the MT2A gene (Fig. 4B). These ChIP experiments showcase the disparity in the mechanism of transcription machinery assembly upon hormone treatment on MT2A and SLC19A2 and may explain their differential response to curcumin treatment. To further understand how curcumin may inhibit the recruitment of RNAPII, we wished to determine whether the impact of curcumin on transcription is specific to GR-mediated recruitment of RNAPII machinery. If curcumin affects RNAPII recruitment by other signaling pathways, it would suggest that curcumin has a general mechanism by which it inhibits activator-mediated recruitment of transcription. To test the generality of the effects of curcumin on transcription activator-mediated transcription, we took advantage of the MT2A gene whose transcription can be activated by both glucocorticoids and metals such as zinc (17Koizumi S.

Biophys. 2007; 463: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The transcription factor, metal-regulatory transcription factor (MTF1), accumulates in the nucleus upon metal exposure and is targeted to gene promoters containing the metal regulatory elements to activate metallothionein and other genes involved in metal homeostasis and detoxification (20Laity J.H. Andrews G.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 463: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine the outcome of curcumin exposure on zinc-mediated transcription, HeLa cells were treated with 50 μm curcumin or vehicle (DMSO) for 30 min followed by 100 μm zinc sulfate (Zn2+) or vehicle (water) for 4 h. After the Zn2+ treatment, cells were harvested, total RNA was collected, and the expression level of MT2A was determined by RT-PCR. The resulting analysis revealed that curcumin inhibits Zn2+-induced transcription activation of MT2A (Fig. 5A). The effect of curcumin on the recruitment of MTF1 to metal regulatory element (MRE) sequences located approximately −50 to −300 bp from the TSS of MT2A (17Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Yamada H. Otsuka F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was monitored by a ChIP experiment. Real-time PCR analysis of the MTF1 ChIP experiments shows that curcumin does not inhibit MTF1 recruitment to the MT2A promoter, consistent with the lack of impact of curcumin on GR recruitment upon Dex activation of MT2A (Fig. 5B). However, although curcumin inhibits Zn2+-induced transcription, the ChIP experiment probing for the effect of curcumin treatment on RNAPII recruitment demonstrated that curcumin has very little effect on the RNAPII recruitment to the MT2A TSS after 1 h of Zn2+ treatment (Fig. 5C). This is in contrast to the GR-mediated transcription inhibition of MT2A transcription where curcumin prevented the recruitment of RNAPII upon Dex treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the Dex-induced transcription activation of MT2A, the above ChIP experiment has demonstrated that curcumin does not affect RNAPII recruitment detected after 1 h of Zn2+ treatment. This suggested that curcumin inhibition of Zn2+-induced MT2A transcription occurs at a step downstream of initial RNAPII recruitment. To test this idea, we monitored the expression level of not only the total MT2A mRNA expressed (RT-PCR primers spanning an exon) but also the presence of pre-spliced, nascent MT2A mRNA in HeLa cells at different time points of Zn2+ treatment in the presence or absence of curcumin. The nascent pre-spliced mRNA was detected by using RT-PCR primers that amplify an exon-intron junction of the MT2A gene. To ensure that we are detecting little to no genomic DNA amplification during the RT-PCR analysis, the isolated RNA samples were treated with DNase I, and minus RT controls, where every component of the RT reaction except for the reverse transcriptase was added, were conducted (data not shown). The time course RT-PCR experiments were consistent with the initial RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5A); curcumin treatment led to very little MT2A overall transcript accumulating over the 4-h time course (Fig. 6, MT2A). In contrast, when the accumulation of pre-spliced MT2A over the Zn2+ treatment time course was assessed, the results showed an initial burst of accumulation of pre-spliced RNA that occurs within 30 min after Zn2+ treatment. This initial burst of pre-spliced RNA accumulation was not greatly affected by curcumin pretreatment (Fig. 6, MT2A pre-spliced), which supports the hypothesis that curcumin does not affect the initial recruitment of RNAPII upon Zn2+ treatment. However, cells treated with curcumin show a rapid decline in the levels of pre-spliced RNA when compared with control cells, which may suggest that curcumin inhibits the continued initiation of transcription, leading to the rapid drop in pre-spliced RNA as they are processed into mature RNA. The ChIP experiments examining the recruitment of RNAPII have revealed that although curcumin treatment leads to decreased RNAPII occupancy at TSS at 1 h of Dex treatment, RNAPII occupancy is not significantly affect"

Here we describe a rapid, precise and cost-efficient method for collection of DNA from cases previously experiencing an osteoporotic fracture by identifying cases using and administrative health-care databases. Over the course of 14 months we collected DNA from 1,130 women experiencing an osteoporotic fracture, at a cost of $54 per sample. This cohort is among the larger DNA osteoporotic fracture collections in the world. The novel method described addresses a major unmet health care research need and is widely applicable to any disease that can be identified accurately through administrative data."
https://openalex.org/W2034734377,"Background Patents are one of the most important forms of intellectual property. They grant a time-limited exclusivity on the use of an invention allowing the recuperation of research costs. The use of patents is fiercely debated for medical innovation and especially controversial for publicly funded research, where the patent holder is an institution accountable to public interest. Despite this controversy, for the situation in Germany almost no empirical information exists. The purpose of this study is to examine the amount, types and trends of patent applications for health products submitted by German public research organisations. Methods/Principal Findings We conducted a systematic search for patent documents using the publicly accessible database search interface of the German Patent and Trademark Office. We defined keywords and search criteria and developed search patterns for the database request. We retrieved documents with application date between 1988 and 2006 and processed the collected data stepwise to compile the most relevant documents in patent families for further analysis. We developed a rationale and present individual steps of a systematic method to request and process patent data from a publicly accessible database. We retrieved and processed 10194 patent documents. Out of these, we identified 1772 relevant patent families, applied for by 193 different universities and non-university public research organisations. 827 (47%) of these patent families contained granted patents. The number of patent applications submitted by universities and university-affiliated institutions more than tripled since the introduction of legal reforms in 2002, constituting almost half of all patent applications and accounting for most of the post-reform increase. Patenting of most non-university public research organisations remained stable. Conclusions We search, process and analyse patent applications from publicly accessible databases. Internationally mounting evidence questions the viability of policies to increase commercial exploitation of publicly funded research results. To evaluate the outcome of research policies a transparent evidence base for public debate is needed in Germany."
https://openalex.org/W1989988018,"Identifying transcription factor (TF) binding sites (TFBSs) is an important step towards understanding transcriptional regulation. A common approach is to use gaplessly aligned, experimentally supported TFBSs for a particular TF, and algorithmically search for more occurrences of the same TFBSs. The largest publicly available databases of TF binding specificities contain models which are represented as position weight matrices (PWM). There are other methods using more sophisticated representations, but these have more limited databases, or aren't publicly available. Therefore, this paper focuses on methods that search using one PWM per TF. An algorithm, MATCHTM, for identifying TFBSs corresponding to a particular PWM is available, but is not based on a rigorous statistical model of TF binding, making it difficult to interpret or adjust the parameters and output of the algorithm. Furthermore, there is no public description of the algorithm sufficient to exactly reproduce it. Another algorithm, MAST, computes a p-value for the presence of a TFBS using true probabilities of finding each base at each offset from that position. We developed a statistical model, BaSeTraM, for the binding of TFs to TFBSs, taking into account random variation in the base present at each position within a TFBS. Treating the counts in the matrices and the sequences of sites as random variables, we combine this TFBS composition model with a background model to obtain a Bayesian classifier. We implemented our classifier in a package (SBaSeTraM). We tested SBaSeTraM against a MATCHTM implementation by searching all probes used in an experimental Saccharomyces cerevisiae TF binding dataset, and comparing our predictions to the data. We found no statistically significant differences in sensitivity between the algorithms (at fixed selectivity), indicating that SBaSeTraM's performance is at least comparable to the leading currently available algorithm.

https://openalex.org/W2016233259,"Background The multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene functions as a tumor suppressor gene in humans and mouse models. In Drosophila melanogaster, mutants of the menin gene (Mnn1) are hypersensitive to mutagens or gamma irradiation and have profound defects in the response to several stresses including heat shock, hypoxia, hyperosmolarity and oxidative stress. However, it is not known if the function of menin in the stress response contributes to genome stability. The objective of this study was to examine the role of menin in the control of the stress response and genome stability. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a test of loss-of-heterozygosity, we show that Drosophila strains lacking a functional Mnn1 gene or expressing a Mnn1 dsRNA display increased genome instability in response to non-lethal heat shock or hypoxia treatments. This is also true for strains lacking all Hsp70 genes, implying that a precise control of the stress response is required for genome stability. While menin is required for Hsp70 expression, the results of epistatic studies indicate that the increase in genome instability observed in Mnn1 lack-of-function mutants cannot be accounted for by mis-expression of Hsp70. Therefore, menin may promote genome stability by controlling the expression of other stress-responsive genes. In agreement with this notion, gene profiling reveals that Mnn1 is required for sustained expression of all heat shock protein genes but is dispensable for early induction of the heat shock response. Conclusions/Significance Mutants of the Mnn1 gene are hypersensitive to several stresses and display increased genome instability when subjected to conditions, such as heat shock, generally regarded as non-genotoxic. In this report, we describe a role for menin as a global regulator of heat shock gene expression and critical factor in the maintenance of genome integrity. Therefore, menin links the stress response to the control of genome stability in Drosophila melanogaster."
https://openalex.org/W2082392445,"Background Recent studies have shown that fluorescently labeled antibodies can be dissociated from their antigen by illumination with laser light. The mechanism responsible for the photounbinding effect, however, remains elusive. Here, we give important insights into the mechanism of photounbinding and show that the effect is not restricted to antibody/antigen binding. Methodology/Principal Findings We present studies of the photounbinding of labeled calmodulin (CaM) from a set of CaM-binding peptides with different affinities to CaM after one- and two-photon excitation. We found that the photounbinding effect becomes stronger with increasing binding affinity. Our observation that photounbinding can be influenced by using free radical scavengers, that it does not occur with either unlabeled protein or non-fluorescent quencher dyes, and that it becomes evident shortly after or with photobleaching suggest that photounbinding and photobleaching are closely linked. Conclusions/Significance The experimental results exclude surface effects, or heating by laser irradiation as potential causes of photounbinding. Our data suggest that free radicals formed through photobleaching may cause a conformational change of the CaM which lowers their binding affinity with the peptide or its respective binding partner."
https://openalex.org/W2071173165,"Background The development of small molecule inhibitors of hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein as antiviral agents has been intensively pursued as a viable strategy to eradicate HCV infection. However, lack of a robust and convenient small animal model has hampered the assessment of in vivo efficacy of any antiviral compound. Methodology/Principal Findings The objective of this work was to develop a novel method to screen anti-core protein siRNA in the mouse liver by bioluminescence imaging. The inhibitory effect of two shRNAs targeting the highly conserved core region of the HCV genome, shRNA452 and shRNA523, was examined using this method. In the transient mouse model, the effect of shRNA-523 was detectable at as early as 24 h and became even more pronounced at later time points. The effect of shRNA-452 was not detectable until 48 h post-transduction. In a stable mouse model, shRNA523 reduced luciferase levels by up to 76.4±26.0% and 91.8±8.0% at 6 h and 12 h after injection respectively, and the inhibitory effect persisted for 1 day after a single injection while shRNA-Scramble did not seem to have an effect on the luciferase activity in vivo. Conclusions/Significance Thus, we developed a simple and quantitative assay for real-time monitoring of HCV core protein inhibitors in mice."
