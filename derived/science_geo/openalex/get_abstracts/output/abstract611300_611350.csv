https://openalex.org/W2803704889,"Plasmon polaritons are hybrid excitations of light and mobile electrons that can confine the energy of long-wavelength radiation at the nanoscale. Plasmon polaritons may enable many enigmatic quantum effects, including lasing 1 , topological protection2,3 and dipole-forbidden absorption 4 . A necessary condition for realizing such phenomena is a long plasmonic lifetime, which is notoriously difficult to achieve for highly confined modes 5 . Plasmon polaritons in graphene—hybrids of Dirac quasiparticles and infrared photons—provide a platform for exploring light–matter interaction at the nanoscale6,7. However, plasmonic dissipation in graphene is substantial 8 and its fundamental limits remain undetermined. Here we use nanometre-scale infrared imaging to investigate propagating plasmon polaritons in high-mobility encapsulated graphene at cryogenic temperatures. In this regime, the propagation of plasmon polaritons is primarily restricted by the dielectric losses of the encapsulated layers, with a minor contribution from electron–phonon interactions. At liquid-nitrogen temperatures, the intrinsic plasmonic propagation length can exceed 10 micrometres, or 50 plasmonic wavelengths, thus setting a record for highly confined and tunable polariton modes. Our nanoscale imaging results reveal the physics of plasmonic dissipation and will be instrumental in mitigating such losses in heterostructure engineering applications. The fundamental limits to plasmon damping in graphene are determined using nanoscale infrared imaging at cryogenic temperatures, and plasmon polaritons are observed to propagate over 10 micrometres in high-mobility encapsulated graphene."

To explore the genetic basis for this scattered occurrence, we sequenced the genomes of 10 plant species covering the diversity of nodule morphotypes, bacterial symbionts, and infection strategies. In a genome-wide comparative analysis of a total of 37 plant species, we discovered signatures of multiple independent loss-of-function events in the indispensable symbiotic regulator NODULE INCEPTION in 10 of 13 genomes of nonnodulating species within this clade. The discovery that multiple independent losses shaped the present-day distribution of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis in plants reveals a phylogenetically wider distribution in evolutionary history and a so-far-underestimated selection pressure against this symbiosis."

https://openalex.org/W2804537880,"In amniotes, the development of the primitive streak and its accompanying 'organizer' define the first stages of gastrulation. Although these structures have been characterized in detail in model organisms, the human primitive streak and organizer remain a mystery. When stimulated with BMP4, micropatterned colonies of human embryonic stem cells self-organize to generate early embryonic germ layers 1 . Here we show that, in the same type of colonies, Wnt signalling is sufficient to induce a primitive streak, and stimulation with Wnt and Activin is sufficient to induce an organizer, as characterized by embryo-like sharp boundary formation, markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and expression of the organizer-specific transcription factor GSC. Moreover, when grafted into chick embryos, human stem cell colonies treated with Wnt and Activin induce and contribute autonomously to a secondary axis while inducing a neural fate in the host. This fulfils the most stringent functional criteria for an organizer, and its discovery represents a milestone in human embryology."

https://openalex.org/W2803273577,"As with many pathogens, most dengue infections are subclinical and therefore unobserved 1 . Coupled with limited understanding of the dynamic behaviour of potential serological markers of infection, this observational problem has wide-ranging implications, including hampering our understanding of individual- and population-level correlates of infection and disease risk and how these change over time, between assay interpretations and with cohort design. Here we develop a framework that simultaneously characterizes antibody dynamics and identifies subclinical infections via Bayesian augmentation from detailed cohort data (3,451 individuals with blood draws every 91 days, 143,548 haemagglutination inhibition assay titre measurements)2,3. We identify 1,149 infections (95% confidence interval, 1,135–1,163) that were not detected by active surveillance and estimate that 65% of infections are subclinical. After infection, individuals develop a stable set point antibody load after one year that places them within or outside a risk window. Individuals with pre-existing titres of ≤1:40 develop haemorrhagic fever 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 2.5–8.2) times more often than naive individuals compared to 0.0 times for individuals with titres >1:40 (95% confidence interval: 0.0–1.3). Plaque reduction neutralization test titres ≤1:100 were similarly associated with severe disease. Across the population, variability in the size of epidemics results in large-scale temporal changes in infection and disease risk that correlate poorly with age. Analyses of antibody dynamics and subclinical infections show that across the population, variability in the infection strength of dengue viruses results in large-scale temporal changes in infection and disease risk that correlate poorly with age."
https://openalex.org/W2803633933,"Body size is intrinsically linked to metabolic rate and life-history traits, and is a crucial determinant of food webs and community dynamics1,2. The increased temperatures associated with the urban-heat-island effect result in increased metabolic costs and are expected to drive shifts to smaller body sizes 3 . Urban environments are, however, also characterized by substantial habitat fragmentation 4 , which favours mobile species. Here, using a replicated, spatially nested sampling design across ten animal taxonomic groups, we show that urban communities generally consist of smaller species. In addition, although we show urban warming for three habitat types and associated reduced community-weighted mean body sizes for four taxa, three taxa display a shift to larger species along the urbanization gradients. Our results show that the general trend towards smaller-sized species is overruled by filtering for larger species when there is positive covariation between size and dispersal, a process that can mitigate the low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings 5 . We thus demonstrate that the urban-heat-island effect and urban habitat fragmentation are associated with contrasting community-level shifts in body size that critically depend on the association between body size and dispersal. Because body size determines the structure and dynamics of ecological networks 1 , such shifts may affect urban ecosystem function. The urban-heat-island effect drives community-level shifts towards smaller body sizes; however, habitat fragmentation caused by urbanization favours larger body sizes in species with positive size–dispersal links."
https://openalex.org/W2804731235,"The cell microenvironment, which is critical for stem cell maintenance, contains both cellular and non-cellular components, including secreted growth factors and the extracellular matrix1-3. Although Notch and other signalling pathways have previously been reported to regulate quiescence of stem cells4-9, the composition and source of molecules that maintain the stem cell niche remain largely unknown. Here we show that adult muscle satellite (stem) cells in mice produce extracellular matrix collagens to maintain quiescence in a cell-autonomous manner. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, we identified NOTCH1/RBPJ-bound regulatory elements adjacent to specific collagen genes, the expression of which is deregulated in Notch-mutant mice. Moreover, we show that Collagen V (COLV) produced by satellite cells is a critical component of the quiescent niche, as depletion of COLV by conditional deletion of the Col5a1 gene leads to anomalous cell cycle entry and gradual diminution of the stem cell pool. Notably, the interaction of COLV with satellite cells is mediated by the Calcitonin receptor, for which COLV acts as a surrogate local ligand. Systemic administration of a calcitonin derivative is sufficient to rescue the quiescence and self-renewal defects found in COLV-null satellite cells. This study reveals a Notch-COLV-Calcitonin receptor signalling cascade that maintains satellite cells in a quiescent state in a cell-autonomous fashion, and raises the possibility that similar reciprocal mechanisms act in diverse stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W2804279371,"The human brain is unusually large. It has tripled in size from Australopithecines to modern humans1 and has become almost six times larger than expected for a placental mammal of human size2. Brains incur high metabolic costs3 and accordingly a long-standing question is why the large human brain has evolved4. The leading hypotheses propose benefits of improved cognition for overcoming ecological5–7, social8–10 or cultural11–14 challenges. However, these hypotheses are typically assessed using correlative analyses, and establishing causes for brain-size evolution remains difficult15,16. Here we introduce a metabolic approach that enables causal assessment of social hypotheses for brain-size evolution. Our approach yields quantitative predictions for brain and body size from formalized social hypotheses given empirical estimates of the metabolic costs of the brain. Our model predicts the evolution of adult Homo sapiens-sized brains and bodies when individuals face a combination of 60% ecological, 30% cooperative and 10% between-group competitive challenges, and suggests that between-individual competition has been unimportant for driving human brain-size evolution. Moreover, our model indicates that brain expansion in Homo was driven by ecological rather than social challenges, and was perhaps strongly promoted by culture. Our metabolic approach thus enables causal assessments that refine, refute and unify hypotheses of brain-size evolution. Using estimates of metabolic costs of the brain and body, mathematical predictions suggest that the evolution of adult Homo sapiens-sized brains and bodies is driven by ecological rather than social challenges and is perhaps strongly promoted by culture."

It proceeds through the 12C + 12C fusion reactions that produce an alpha particle and neon-20 or a proton and sodium-23-that is, 12C(12C, α)20Ne and 12C(12C, p)23Na-at temperatures greater than 0.4 × 109 kelvin, corresponding to astrophysical energies exceeding a megaelectronvolt, at which such nuclear reactions are more likely to occur in stars. The cross-sections 4 for those carbon fusion reactions (probabilities that are required to calculate the rate of the reactions) have hitherto not been measured at the Gamow peaks 4 below 2 megaelectronvolts because of exponential suppression arising from the Coulomb barrier. The reference rate 5 at temperatures below 1.2 × 109 kelvin relies on extrapolations that ignore the effects of possible low-lying resonances. Here we report the measurement of the 12C(12C, α0,1)20Ne and 12C(12C, p0,1)23Na reaction rates (where the subscripts 0 and 1 stand for the ground and first excited states of 20Ne and 23Na, respectively) at centre-of-mass energies from 2.7 to 0.8 megaelectronvolts using the Trojan Horse method6,7 and the deuteron in 14N. The cross-sections deduced exhibit several resonances that are responsible for very large increases of the reaction rate at relevant temperatures. In particular, around 5 × 108 kelvin, the reaction rate is boosted to more than 25 times larger than the reference value 5 . This finding may have implications such as lowering the temperatures and densities 8 required for the ignition of carbon burning in massive stars and decreasing the superburst ignition depth in accreting neutron stars to reconcile observations with theoretical models 3 ."

https://openalex.org/W2803307559,"Detecting the direction of motion of an object is essential for our representation of the visual environment. The visual cortex is one of the main stages in the mammalian nervous system in which the direction of motion may be computed de novo. Experiments and theories indicate that cortical neurons respond selectively to motion direction by combining inputs that provide information about distinct spatial locations with distinct time delays. Despite the importance of this spatiotemporal offset for direction selectivity, its origin and cellular mechanisms are not fully understood. We show that approximately 80 ± 10 thalamic neurons, which respond with distinct time courses to stimuli in distinct locations, excite mouse visual cortical neurons during visual stimulation. The integration of thalamic inputs with the appropriate spatiotemporal offset provides cortical neurons with a primordial bias for direction selectivity. These data show how cortical neurons selectively combine the spatiotemporal response diversity of thalamic neurons to extract fundamental features of the visual world."

Nakamura and Huang interpret the poorly understood origins of these systems as the meteorological equivalents of traffic congestion on a highway and show how they can be described by analogous mathematical theory. Climate change may affect the frequency of blocking as well as its geographic distribution, reflecting a simultaneous shift in the structure of the stationary atmospheric waves and the regional capacity of the jet stream.

At the molecular level, the complete loss of function associated with some mutations linked to NHD and frontotemporal dementia, including Q33X and Y38C, can be explained by truncation (Q33X) or misfolding of the protein due to aberrant disulfide bond formation (Y38C).

An understanding of the structural and biophysical properties of WT and variant ECD is also important for better understanding the properties of the shed or soluble form of TREM2 (sTREM2). sTREM2 is composed of the extracellular putative ligand binding domain of TREM2, where the Ig domain is followed by a short stalk terminating at His157 (14.Schlepckow K.

Key outstanding questions include how the R47H variant affects levels of sTREM2 in vivo; what link exists between sTREM2 levels, TREM2 receptor activity, and microglia activity; and how sTREM2 interferes with therapeutics designed to target the receptor. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the loss of function conferred by the R47H variant and to inform effective therapeutic strategies targeting TREM2 in neurodegenerative diseases, we have carried out structural, biochemical, functional, and biophysical studies on the ECDs of both R47H and WT TREM2. Here we report high-resolution crystal structures of R47H TREM2 and WT TREM2 at 1.8 and 2.2 Å, respectively. We also describe the co-crystal structure of TREM2 complexed with a putative ligand, phosphatidylserine (PS), at 2.2 Å. Furthermore, we describe the effect of the variant on both in vitro and in vivo stability of sTREM2. Together, these data advance our understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning the effects of the R47H TREM2 variant on the fold, stability, functional activity, and putative positive ligand–interacting surface (PLIS) impacting ligand binding. Human TREM2 is a polypeptide chain of 230 amino acids that consists of a single 156-amino acid N-terminal mature ECD (residues 19–174, with residues 1–18 constituting signal peptide), a membrane-spanning region (residues 175–195), and a C-terminal cytosolic tail (residues 196–230). Here, we focused our structural and biophysical efforts on the ECD of WT and R47H TREM2 proteins for the reasons discussed above. To generate soluble and homogenous proteins, we engineered various forms of WT and R47H TREM2 ECDs, including truncations and glycosylation-site mutations (Asn20 and Asn79) and also screened different expression systems (see “Experimental procedures” and Table S4). We were ultimately successful in obtaining diffracting crystals for R47H TREM2 produced by Escherichia coli expression and WT TREM2 with an N20D mutation produced by mammalian expression. The crystal structure of R47H TREM2 (residues 19–131) was solved to 1.8 Å resolution in the P21212 space group with two molecules per asymmetric unit (asu) arranged in a dimeric “tail-to-tail” configuration (see “Experimental procedures,” Table S1, and Fig. S1A). The total buried solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) between the two molecules in the asu is 605 Å2 with a shape complementarity (Sc) score of 0.49, suggesting that the protein is unlikely to exist as a dimer in solution, consistent with size-exclusion chromatography data. Analysis of the three antibody-equivalent complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops reveals a distinct and nonstandard 2-turn helix CDR2 loop conformation between β-strands C′ and C″ (Fig. 1A). The structure of WT TREM2 ECD (residues 19–141) was determined to 2.2 Å resolution (see “Experimental procedures” and Table S1) in the P41212 space group with six molecules per asu (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1, B–D). Three of the six molecules in the asu assumed a core trimeric arrangement (molecules A, B, and C), with the other three molecules packed in the interfaces between each pair of neighboring molecules in the trimer core (molecules D, E, and F) (Fig. S1, B–F). The total buried SASAs between the molecule pairs within the core trimer (A-B, A-C, and B-C) are between 672 and 687 Å2, with the Sc score ranging from 0.68 to 0.73 (Tables S2 and S3). In contrast, the total buried SASAs of the exterior TREM2 molecules with the neighboring trimer exhibit a broader range from 472 to 672 Å2. Correspondingly, the shape complementarities of these surfaces also exhibit a broader range from 0.60 to 0.81. Here the Sc scores are borderline to typical Sc scores of 0.70–0.76 for protein oligomeric interfaces and the buried SASAs are approaching the cutoff of 850 Å2 for monomeric proteins (18.Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. Shape complementarity at protein/protein interfaces.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234 (8263940): 946-95010.1006/jmbi.1993.1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 19.Chothia C. Janin J. Principles of protein–protein recognition.Nature. 1975; 256 (1153006): 705-70810.1038/256705a0Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). These scores, along with solution state characterization by size exclusion and dynamic light scattering, indicate that the 6-mer observed in the crystal packing of WT TREM2 is less likely to be the biologically relevant form. However, the interface analysis also indicates that WT TREM2 has a higher propensity to oligomerize than R47H TREM2, and the trimeric interfaces provide one example of putative interaction interfaces. In addition, at 2.2 Å resolution, most residues in our WT TREM2 structure are well defined in the electron density maps, enabling us to clearly elucidate atomic interactions. Whereas the R47H variant and WT structures are highly similar in the core fold, there is a remarkable structural change in the CDR2 loop region, with CDR2 loop in the R47H structure adopting a completely different conformation compared with the WT structure (Fig. 1D). The downstream β-strand C″ and C″-D loop are disordered in the R47H variant as well (Fig. 1D). Superposition of the R47H and WT structures results in an r.m.s. deviation of 1.1 Å over all of the backbone Cα atoms (residues 19–130). When residues 67–81 from the CDR2 loop, β-strand C″, and loop C″-D are excluded, however, the r.m.s. deviation drops to 0.52 Å, indicating that the variant structure differs from WT mainly in the region of the CDR2 loop to loop C″-D. At the molecular level, the CDR2 loop remodels as a short helix in the R47H variant. This occurrence can be described by an entirely different set of interactions in the region surrounding the R47H mutation, which resides in the C-terminal region of the CDR1 loop, compared with the WT structure. In the WT structure, the Arg47 side chain projects into the N-terminal region of the CDR2 loop, participating in extensive hydrogen bond networks with residues in the CDR2 loop, including the side chain of Ser65, the backbone carbonyls of Thr66 and His67, and the side chain of Asn68 (Fig. 2A). As a result, Arg47 plays a critical structural role in maintaining the fold of the N-terminal area of the CDR2 loop. Other hydrogen bond interactions in the region extend from the carbonyl of Lys48 to the amide of Thr66 and from the amide of Lys48 to the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr66 (Fig. 2A). Whereas the R47H variant maintains the two hydrogen bond interactions between Lys48 in the C terminus of the CDR1 loop and Thr66 in the N terminus of CDR2 loop, the hydrogen bond network interactions from Arg47 to Ser65, Thr66, His67, and Asn68 of the CDR2 loop noted in the WT structure are all absent in the R47H variant structure. The imidazole group of the His47 side chain in the R47H variant of CDR1 makes no direct hydrogen-bond interactions with the backbone of the CDR2 loop. Instead, the His47 imidazole moiety directly hydrogen-bonds with the side-chain hydroxyl of Thr66 and also forms π–π stacking interactions with the His67 imidazole ring from the CDR2 loop (Fig. 2B). His67 undergoes a dramatic conformational change to swing ∼180° toward the area of the C terminus of CDR1, facilitating interactions with His47 (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, in the WT structure, residue His67 from the CDR2 loop adopts an extended conformation toward the exterior of the protein (Fig. 2A). As a result of numerous intramolecular interactions from Arg47 to CDR2, the CDR2 loop in the WT structure is very stable, as indicated by its low B-factors (Fig. S2A). In the R47H variant structure, however, whereas the N-terminal part of the CDR2 loop that interacts with the CDR1 loop remains stable, the rest of the CDR2 loop (residues Leu69–Leu75 in the short helix) presents high B-factors due to lack of intramolecular interactions, followed by a disordered β-strand C″ compared with the rest of the protein (Fig. S2B). Consequently, Arg47 plays a critical structural role in maintaining the tertiary architecture in the region around the C terminus of the CDR1 loop and the N terminus of the CDR2 loop. The arginine-to-histidine mutation in the R47H variant abolishes the extensive interactions specific for the arginine residue, reducing the stability of the CDR2 loop and its downstream β-strand C″. In this manner, CDR2 loop remodeling in the R47H variant can be traced back readily to the single amino acid mutation of R47H in the CDR1 loop, probably causing the rest of the CDR2 loop to be moved out of register with its partner strands. The drastic conformational change in the CDR2 loop in the R47H variant also results in substantial modifications in the putative PLIS on the A-G-F-C-C′ sheet of WT TREM2 composed mainly of a few basic residues, including Arg47 (CDR1 loop), Arg62 (β-strand C′), His67 (CDR2 loop), and Arg77 (β-strand C″) (Fig. 2, C and D). Kober et al. (12.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2 reveal a functional surface and distinct loss-of-function mechanisms.eLife. 2016; 5 (27995897): e20391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) also reported a similar PLIS. The altered interactions in the R47H variant discussed above, especially the swing of His67 to make His47–His67 stacking, result in a disruption in the close interactions of the CDR2 loop with CDR1 and β-strand C″, subsequently resulting in a net reduction in the PLIS of the variant and the appearance of a significantly altered surface (Fig. 2D). With regard to the influence of crystal contacts on the altered conformation of the CDR loops, His47 in the R47H variant completely remodels the fold encompassing CDR2, which is not involved in crystal packing in the asymmetric unit or between symmetry-related molecules. As well, examination of CDR1 and CDR3 reveals that these loops are not involved in crystal contacts involving CDR2, again within the asymmetric unit or between symmetry-related molecules. The WT TREM2 CDR2 loop does have crystal contacts with both the CDR1 and D-E loops of neighboring molecules. However, the CDR2 loop has a fold highly similar to the fold observed in the recently reported WT TREM2 crystal structure (12.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2 reveal a functional surface and distinct loss-of-function mechanisms.eLife. 2016; 5 (27995897): e20391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although the two structures are determined in two different space groups with different crystal packing(s) (Fig. 1C). Due to the numerous interactions of Arg47 with the CDR2 loop, it is more likely that the extensiveness of this interaction makes intramolecular contact more dominant and thus less likely to be impacted by crystal packing. Comparison of the R47H and WT structures clearly reveals the impact of an arginine-to-histidine mutation at residue 47 on the TREM2 ECD structural fold. The protein sources for each structure differ, however, and this difference must be addressed. The WT structure was derived from mammalian protein, whereas the R47H variant structure was derived from E. coli expressed protein and lacks the glycosylation observed at Asn79 in the WT structure. To address the possible contribution of Asn79 glycosylation to the observed differences between the WT and R47H TREM2 structures, we examined the interactions of the NAG glycan with other residues in the WT structure in greater detail. In the WT structures presented here and the previously reported structure (Protein Data Bank code 5ELI) (12.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2 reveal a functional surface and distinct loss-of-function mechanisms.eLife. 2016; 5 (27995897): e20391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the Asn79-NAG shares the same hydrogen bond interaction through the amide of Asn79 to the backbone carbonyl of Val63 of β-strand C′, and the GlcNAc moieties have only weak van der Waals contacts with Arg62, Val63, and Val64 of β-strand C′ (Fig. 3A). In addition, the NAG moieties in the two WT structures have different orientations (Fig. 1C) and much higher B-factors in both instances compared with TREM2 residues in the vicinity of the NAGs (Fig. 3A), suggesting dynamic, nonspecific NAG conformations. As a result, the presence or absence of glycan is unlikely to play a significant role in the structural fold of the TREM2 protein. Whereas the lack of a glycan on Asn79 in the R47H variant might contribute to some extent to the disordering of the more distal β-strand C″, it is unlikely to result in the dramatic N-terminal remodeling of the CDR2 loop. Instead, the dramatic conformational change of His67 is well supported by the altered atomic interactions resulting from the single arginine-to-histidine mutation at residue 47. To further probe the effect of glycosylation on R47H TREM2, we conducted structural and biophysical studies on mammalian R47H TREM2. Despite intensive effort, we were unable to obtain crystals of mammalian expressed R47H TREM2 or E. coli expressed WT TREM2 (Table S4). We were, however, able to obtain pure, homogeneous protein for mammalian expressed WT and R47H TREM2 ECD (residues 19–174) for biophysical characterization. An analysis of glycan content for these two protein samples of WT and R47H variant revealed nearly equivalent glycan type and content at both the Asn20 and Asn79 positions (Fig. 3, B and C). Thermal stability measurements (melting temperature (Tm)), however, revealed a 10 °C difference between constructs with a Tm = 55.7 °C for the R47H variant compared with Tm = 67.5 °C for WT TREM2 (Fig. 3D). These data clearly support the profound effect of the R47H mutation in driving conformational changes that result in stability loss. Both WT and R47H variant proteins utilized in these experiments have the same glycan type and content, and hence the observed differences in stability can be explained by the variant alone. Finally, our structural observations, including the remodeled short α-helix and disordered β-strand (C″) in the R47H variant compared with WT TREM2, are consistent with and provide detailed and unprecedented molecular insight into the differences in WT and R47H TREM2 observed by lower-resolution CD spectroscopy (12.Kober D.L. Alexander-Brett J.M. Karch C.M. Cruchaga C. Colonna M. Holtzman M.J. Brett T.J. Neurodegenerative disease mutations in TREM2 reveal a functional surface and distinct loss-of-function mechanisms.eLife. 2016; 5 (27995897): e20391Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine whether the in vitro differences in stability and structure of WT and R47H ECDs translate to differences in in vivo levels, we developed a homogeneous ELISA to determine steady-state, homeostatic levels of soluble and total TREM2 in plasma and brains of WT and R47H TREM2 mice (for a brief description of mice, see “Experimental procedures”; for a detailed description, see Cheng et al.

https://openalex.org/W2803828311,"Conventional ubiquitination regulates key cellular processes by catalysing the ATP-dependent formation of an isopeptide bond between ubiquitin (Ub) and primary amines in substrate proteins 1 . Recently, the SidE family of bacterial effector proteins (SdeA, SdeB, SdeC and SidE) from pathogenic Legionella pneumophila were shown to use NAD+ to mediate phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination of serine residues in host proteins2, 3. However, the molecular architecture of the catalytic platform that enables this complex multistep process remains unknown. Here we describe the structure of the catalytic core of SdeA, comprising mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (mART) and phosphodiesterase (PDE) domains, and shed light on the activity of two distinct catalytic sites for serine ubiquitination. The mART catalytic site is composed of an α-helical lobe (AHL) that, together with the mART core, creates a chamber for NAD+ binding and ADP-ribosylation of ubiquitin. The catalytic site in the PDE domain cleaves ADP-ribosylated ubiquitin to phosphoribosyl ubiquitin (PR-Ub) and mediates a two-step PR-Ub transfer reaction: first to a catalytic histidine 277 (forming a transient SdeA H277-PR-Ub intermediate) and subsequently to a serine residue in host proteins. Structural analysis revealed a substrate binding cleft in the PDE domain, juxtaposed with the catalytic site, that is essential for positioning serines for ubiquitination. Using degenerate substrate peptides and newly identified ubiquitination sites in RTN4B, we show that disordered polypeptides with hydrophobic residues surrounding the target serine residues are preferred substrates for SdeA ubiquitination. Infection studies with L. pneumophila expressing substrate-binding mutants of SdeA revealed that substrate ubiquitination, rather than modification of the cellular ubiquitin pool, determines the pathophysiological effect of SdeA during acute bacterial infection."

Several important aspects of the longer-term effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystems remain unresolved, including how these effects depend on environmental context5–7. Here we analyse data from an across-ecosystem biodiversity manipulation experiment that, to our knowledge, represents the world’s longest-running experiment of this type. This experiment has been set up on 30 lake islands in Sweden that vary considerably in productivity and soil fertility owing to differences in fire history8,9. We tested the effects of environmental context on how plant species loss affected two fundamental community attributes—plant community biomass and temporal variability—over 20 years. In contrast to findings from artificially assembled communities10–12, we found that the effects of species loss on community biomass decreased over time; this decrease was strongest on the least productive and least fertile islands. Species loss generally also increased temporal variability, and these effects were greatest on the most productive and most fertile islands. Our findings highlight that the ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity loss are not constant across ecosystems and that understanding and forecasting these consequences necessitates taking into account the overarching role of environmental context. A long-term biodiversity manipulation experiment using plant communities on thirty Swedish lake islands reveals the importance of environmental context for determining the consequences of species loss at the ecosystem level."

https://openalex.org/W2804182483,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that regulates many cellular processes in eukaryotes1-4. The conventional ubiquitination cascade culminates in a covalent linkage between the C terminus of ubiquitin (Ub) and a target protein, usually on a lysine side chain1,5. Recent studies of the Legionella pneumophila SidE family of effector proteins revealed a ubiquitination method in which a phosphoribosyl ubiquitin (PR-Ub) is conjugated to a serine residue on substrates via a phosphodiester bond6-8. Here we present the crystal structure of a fragment of the SidE family member SdeA that retains ubiquitination activity, and determine the mechanism of this unique post-translational modification. The structure reveals that the catalytic module contains two distinct functional units: a phosphodiesterase domain and a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase domain. Biochemical analysis shows that the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase domain-mediated conversion of Ub to ADP-ribosylated Ub (ADPR-Ub) and the phosphodiesterase domain-mediated ligation of PR-Ub to substrates are two independent activities of SdeA. Furthermore, we present two crystal structures of a homologous phosphodiesterase domain from the SidE family member SdeD 9 in complexes with Ub and ADPR-Ub. The structures suggest a mechanism for how SdeA processes ADPR-Ub to PR-Ub and AMP, and conjugates PR-Ub to a serine residue in substrates. Our study establishes the molecular mechanism of phosphoribosyl-linked ubiquitination and will enable future studies of this unusual type of ubiquitination in eukaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2804864222,"Radio pulsars scintillate because their emission travels through the ionized interstellar medium via multiple paths, which interfere with each other. It has long been realized that the scattering screens responsible for the scintillation could be used as `interstellar lenses' to localize pulsar emission regions. Most scattering screens, however, only marginally resolve emission components, limiting results to statistical inferences and detections of small positional shifts. Since screens situated close to the source have better resolution, it should be easier to resolve emission regions of pulsars located in high density environments such as supernova remnants or binaries in which the pulsar's companion has an ionized outflow. Here, we report events of extreme plasma lensing in the `Black Widow' pulsar, PSR~B1957+20, near the phase in its 9.2 hour orbit in which its emission is eclipsed by its companion's outflow. During the lensing events, the flux is enhanced by factors of up to 70--80 at specific frequencies. The strongest events clearly resolve the emission regions: they affect the narrow main pulse and parts of the wider interpulse differently. We show that the events arise naturally from density fluctuations in the outer regions of the outflow, and infer a resolution of our lenses comparable to the pulsar's radius, about 10\,km. Furthermore, the distinct frequency structures imparted by the lensing are reminiscent of what is observed for the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102, providing observational support for the idea that this source is observed through, and thus at times strongly magnified by, plasma lenses."

In this study, the relationship between the adhesion activity of, and metabolic changes in, L. plantarum ATCC 14917 under initial acid and alkali stress was evaluated by analyzing auto-aggregation, protein adhesion and cell adhesion in vitro. Based on scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, the morphology of the bacteria became thickset and the thickness of their cell walls decreased under initial alkali stress. The fold changes of auto-aggregation, adhere to mucin and HT-29 cell lines of L. plantarum ATCC 14917 in the acid group were increased by 1.141, 1.125 and 1.156, respectively. But decreased significantly in the alkali group (fold changes with 0.842, 0.728 and 0.667). Adhesion—related protein increased in the acid group but declined in the alkali group at the mRNA expression level according to real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. The changes in the metabolite profiles of L. plantarum ATCC 14917 were characterized using Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray ionization-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-mass spectrometry (UPLS-ESI-Q-TOF-MS). In the alkali group, the content of a lot of substances involved in the energy and amino acid metabolism decreased, but the content of some substances involved in the energy metabolism was slightly increased in the acid group. These findings demonstrate that energy metabolism is positively correlated with the adhesion ability of L. plantarum ATCC 14917. The amino-acids metabolism, especially the amino acids related to pH-homeostasis mechanisms (lysine, aspartic acid, arginine, proline and glutamic acid), showed an obvious effect on the adhesion ability of L. plantarum ATCC 14917.

Vascular endothelial zinc finger 1 (Vezf1), is a Krüppel-like zinc finger protein that plays a vital role in vascular development. However, the mechanism by which Vezf1 regulates this process is not fully understood. Here, we show that Vezf1−/− mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) have significantly increased expression of a stem cell factor, Cbp/p300-interacting transactivator 2 (Cited2). Compared with WT ESCs, Vezf1−/− ESCs inefficiently differentiated into endothelial cells (ECs), which exhibited defects in the tube-formation assay. These defects were due to reduced activation of EC-specific genes concomitant with lower enrichment of histone 3 acetylation at Lys27 (H3K27) at their promoters. We hypothesized that overexpression of Cited2 in Vezf1−/− cells sequesters P300/CBP away from the promoters of proangiogenic genes and thereby contributes to defective angiogenesis in these cells. This idea was supported by the observation that shRNA-mediated depletion of Cited2 significantly reduces the angiogenic defects in the Vezf1−/− ECs. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on the role of Vezf1 as a transcriptional activator of proangiogenic genes, our findings have revealed a role for Vezf1 in modulating the expression of the antiangiogenic factor Cited2. Vezf1 previously has been characterized as an insulator protein, and our results now provide insights into the mechanism, indicating that Vezf1 can block inappropriate, nonspecific interactions of promoters with cis-located enhancers, preventing aberrant promoter activation.

These defects were due to reduced activation of EC-specific genes concomitant with lower enrichment of histone 3 acetylation at Lys27 (H3K27) at their promoters. We hypothesized that overexpression of Cited2 in Vezf1−/− cells sequesters P300/CBP away from the promoters of proangiogenic genes and thereby contributes to defective angiogenesis in these cells. This idea was supported by the observation that shRNA-mediated depletion of Cited2 significantly reduces the angiogenic defects in the Vezf1−/− ECs. In contrast to previous studies that have focused on the role of Vezf1 as a transcriptional activator of proangiogenic genes, our findings have revealed a role for Vezf1 in modulating the expression of the antiangiogenic factor Cited2. Vezf1 previously has been characterized as an insulator protein, and our results now provide insights into the mechanism, indicating that Vezf1 can block inappropriate, nonspecific interactions of promoters with cis-located enhancers, preventing aberrant promoter activation."
https://openalex.org/W2804087081,"Kidney fibrosis is a histological hallmark of chronic kidney disease and arises in large part through extracellular matrix deposition by activated fibroblasts. The signaling protein complex mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) plays a critical role in fibroblast activation and kidney fibrosis. Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is one of the major sub-pathways of mTORC2, but its role in fibroblast activation and kidney fibrosis remains to be determined. Here, we found that transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) activates PKCα signaling in cultured NRK-49F cells in a time-dependent manner. Blocking PKCα signaling with the chemical inhibitor Go6976 or by transfection with PKCα siRNA largely reduced expression of the autophagy-associated protein lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) and also inhibited autophagosome–lysosome fusion and autophagic flux in the cells. Similarly to chloroquine, Go6976 treatment and PKCα siRNA transfection also markedly inhibited TGFβ1-induced fibroblast activation. In murine fibrotic kidneys with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) nephropathy, PKCα signaling is activated in the interstitial myofibroblasts. Go6976 administration largely blocked autophagic flux in fibroblasts in the fibrotic kidneys and attenuated the UUO nephropathy. Together, our findings suggest that blocking PKCα activity may retard autophagic flux and thereby prevent fibroblast activation and kidney fibrosis."

Class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks), which contain 4 isoforms, α, β, δ, and γ, are known to play important roles in cell growth, migration, invasion, and so on. However, the respective role of each PI3K isoform in cancer cell migration and invasion remains unknown. In a study that aimed to elucidate the respective role of the 4 PI3K isoforms, we investigated the change in migratory and invasive ability of DU145 cells after treatment with each PI3K isoform-specific inhibitor. Both migration and invasion of DU145 cells were potently blocked by each of the PI3Kβ inhibitors (GSK2636771 and TGX221) and PI3Kδ inhibitors (CAL101 and IC87114) while not obviously affected by PI3Kα inhibitor BYL719 or PI3Kγ inhibitor AS252424. Furthermore, knocking down PI3Kβ or PI3Kδ isoform led to a significant decrease in migration of DU145. The results suggest that PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ play key roles in prostate cancer cell migration, while PI3Kα and PI3Kγ might be redundant. Oral administration of GSK2636771 (100 mg/kg) and CAL101 (30 mg/kg) inhibited tumor growth in bone, an experimental model by intratibia injection of DU145 cells, with improved bone structure and bone mineral density analyzed by micro-computed tomography. Tissue staining indicated reduction of metastatic DU145 cells and osteoclasts in the bones of GSK2636771- and CAL101-treated mice compared to the untreated group. In summary, our results indicated the distinct roles of 4 PI3K isoforms in the migration of prostate cancer DU145 cells, and they demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo antimetastatic effect of PI3K-isoform specific inhibitors, most of which are in clinical trials.—Zhang, Z., Liu, J., Wang, Y., Tan, X., Zhao, W., Xing, X., Qiu, Y., Wang, R., Jin, M., Fan, G., Zhang, P., Zhong, Y., Kong, D.

https://openalex.org/W2803282183,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has a crucial role in cell differentiation and proliferation and cancer, and its expression appears to be up-regulated when arylsulfatase B (ARSB or GalNAc-4-sulfatase) is reduced. ARSB removes 4-sulfate groups from the nonreducing end of dermatan sulfate and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S), and its decreased expression has previously been reported to inhibit the activity of the ubiquitous protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 11 (SHP2 or PTPN11). However, the mechanism by which decline in ARSB leads to decline in SHP2 activity is unclear. Here, we show that SHP2 binds preferentially C4S, rather than chondroitin 6-sulfate, and confirm that SHP2 activity declines when ARSB is silenced. The reduction in ARSB activity, and the resultant increase in C4S, increased the expression of EGFR (Her1/ErbB1) in human prostate stem and epithelial cells. The increased expression of EGFR occurred after 1) the decline in SHP2 activity, 2) enhanced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, 3) increased nuclear DNA binding by c-Jun and c-Fos, and 4) EGFR promoter activation. In response to exogenous EGF, there was increased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, consistent with enhanced cell proliferation. These findings indicated that ARSB and chondroitin 4-sulfation affect the activation of an important dual phosphorylation threonine–tyrosine kinase and the mRNA expression of a critical tyrosine kinase receptor in prostate cells. Restoration of ARSB activity with the associated reduction in C4S may provide a new therapeutic approach for managing malignancies in which EGFR-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways are active.

https://openalex.org/W2803761043,"Fitness is determined by the ability of an organism to both survive and reproduce; however, the mechanisms that lead to increased survival may not have the same effect on reproductive success. We used nineteen natural Drosophila melanogaster genotypes from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel to determine if adaptive plasticity following short-term acclimation through rapid cold-hardening (RCH) affects mating behavior and mating success. We confirmed that exposure to the acclimation temperature is beneficial to survival following cold stress; however, we found that this same acclimation temperature exposure led to less efficient male courtship and a significant decrease in the likelihood of mating. Cold tolerance and the capacity to respond plastically to cold stress were not correlated with mating behavior following acclimation, suggesting that the genetic control of the physiological effects of the cold temperature exposure likely differ between survival and behavioral responses. We also tested whether the exposure of males to the acclimation temperature influenced courtship song. This exposure again significantly increased courtship duration; however, courtship song was unchanged. These results illustrate costs of short-term acclimation on survival and reproductive components of fitness and demonstrate the pronounced effect that short-term thermal environment shifts can have on reproductive success."
https://openalex.org/W2803337386,"India with estimated more than 2000 tigers (across 18 states) accounts for more than half of the remaining tigers across its range countries. Long-term conservation requires measures to protect the large carnivores and its prey base beyond the Protect Areas. The Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) and adjoining forest divisions with high density of tigers play a crucial role in conservation of tiger in Uttarakhand state as well as the Terai-Arc Landscape. However, CTR is surrounded with multiple-use forest (forest divisions), agriculture land, human habitation, townships and developmental projects. The movement of large carnivores and other wildlife through such habitats adds to the chances of human-wildlife conflict. The aim of the current study was to understand the patterns of livestock depredation by tigers and leopards in and around CTR. We examined a total of 8365 incidents of livestock depredation between 2006 and 2015 with tigers killing more livestock in a year (573.3±41.2) than leopards (263.2±9.9). Geographically, in north zone of CTR leopards were the major livestock predator (166.6±11), whereas tigers (547.7±40.1) in south zone. Examination of livestock kills indicated cows (75%) as the main victim, followed by buffaloes and other species. Analysis revealed that the livestock depredation by tigers varied significantly among seasons in south zone but not in north zone. However, such an explicit seasonal variation was not observed for leopards in north and south zone of CTR. Hotspots of livestock predation were identified around CTR. Addressing a conflict situation in a time-bound manner, timely disbursement of ex-gratia payment, involving locals at various tourism related activities and consistent rapport building initiatives are required to mitigate the human-wildlife conflict."
https://openalex.org/W2803182138,"Active matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases including osteoarthritis (OA), which involves progressive proteolytic degradation of cartilage. Clinical success of OA interventions that target MMPs has been limited by a lack of information about the presence and activity of specific disease-related proteases. We therefore developed a chemoproteomics approach based on MS to characterize the release and activity of MMPs in an in vitro model of the early inflammatory phase of posttraumatic OA (PTOA). We designed and synthesized chemical activity-based probes (ABPs) to identify active MMPs in bovine cartilage explants cultured for 30 days with the proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1α. Using these probes in an activity-based protein profiling-multidimensional identification technology (ABPP-MudPIT) approach, we identified active MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -9, -12, and -13 in the medium after 10 days of culture, the time at which irreversible proteolysis of the collagen network in the explant was detected using proteolytic activation of FRET-quenched MMP substrates. Total MMP levels were quantified by shotgun proteomics, which, taken with ABPP-MudPIT data, indicated the presence of predominantly inactive MMPs in the culture medium. The selectivity of the ABPP-MudPIT approach was further validated by detection of specific endogenous MMPs activated de novo with 4-aminophenylmurcuric acetate.

MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases, and their activity, activation, and localization are tightly regulated by interactions with other proteins, proteoglycan core proteins, and other matrix molecules (7.Hadler-Olsen E.

MMP activity is integral to normal extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling processes such as the cartilage-to-bone transition during ossification, wound healing, and embryonic development, whereas dysregulation of MMP activity has been implicated in many pathophysiological processes including rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (8.Woessner J.F.

Thus, OA therapeutics would need to inhibit pathological MMP activity while preserving activity required for healthy tissue remodeling. Unfortunately, the clinical efficacy of protease modulation therapies have been disappointing across various disease states (9.Vandenbroucke R.E. Libert C.

Computational systems biology approaches have begun to reveal how inhibition of one pathway in the complex MMP network can enhance other pathways in nonintuitive and deleterious ways and have provided some insights into the clinical failure of MMP inhibitors.

However, extensive protease posttranslational modification and the presence of endogenous inhibitors have made unbiased robust characterization of active proteases challenging, especially in the context of complicated disease models. For example, zymography, a common technique to monitor active MMPs, fails to account for inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases (TIMPs), and cannot readily detect MMPs that do not cleave known matrix proteins (15.Mungall B.A. Pollitt C.C.

Despite the promise of ABP techniques for active protease detection, their limited sensitivity for detecting low concentrations of labeled active proteases has been a barrier to broad implementation. Here, we describe how modifications of ABP chemical structures, sample preparation methods, and detection methods together provide sufficient improvements in detection limits such that ABPs can be deployed to illuminate protease activity changes in biological samples. Specifically, we demonstrate the application of a functional proteomic approach based on MS–activity-based protein profiling-multidimensional identification technology (ABPP-MudPIT), to characterize active MMPs in an in vitro model of early-stage cartilage degradation in post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Early after joint injury, an up-regulation of inflammatory cytokines in the synovial fluid promotes cartilage degradation (24.Anderson D.D. Chubinskaya S. Guilak F. Martin J.A. Oegema T.R. Olson S.A.

Our in vitro model consists of cultured bovine cartilage explants treated with the pro-inflammatory factor IL-1α; the culture medium is a surrogate for the synovial fluid aspirates obtained clinically from patients with PTOA. We designed and synthesized next generation ABPs coupled to a pulldown handle for affinity capture of specific active MMPs and incorporated a cleavable linker to decrease probe selectivity. We optimized tissue sample preparation and analysis with the ABPP-MudPIT approach to quantify specific active MMPs in pooled conditioned culture medium with sufficient sensitivity. We also conducted an extensive validation of our ABPs for measuring active metalloproteases in the PTOA model. Our findings suggest that the ABPP-MudPIT approach could be adapted for active protease measurement in other complex disease models. Furthermore, our analysis of MMP activities in a model of PTOA may lead to the development of synovial fluid biomarkers for earlier clinical diagnosis and more effective treatments to slow tissue degradation in PTOA. Due to large variations in MMP active site structure and universal applicability, we synthesized three distinct ABPs (21.Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F.

To promote efficient enrichment and identification of active MMPs, we incorporated a selectively cleavable linker into each ABPs, consisting of a unique disulfide bridge protected by vicinal dimethyl groups (27.Gartner C.A. Elias J.E. Bakalarski C.E. Gygi S.P. Catch-and-release reagents for broadscale quantitative proteomics analyses.J. Proteome Res. 2007; 6 (17311443): 1482-149110.1021/pr060605fCrossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To validate the utility of the linkers, we monitored the stability of the three ABPs at various dithiothreitol (DTT) concentrations, temperatures, and levels of UV irradiation, each representing reductive conditions employed during labeling of active MMPs and avidin bead capture of tagged target molecules during the ABPP-MudPIT protocol. A time course characterization of the solution phase probes via LC/MS confirmed the stability of all three probes under all tested conditions. Furthermore, an optimized cleavage condition, 10 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.7), 0.5% diethanolamine, and 20% methanol at 37 °C, was found to be optimal for release of captured proteins from avidin beads. We further validated the linker modification in Probe 1 (Fig. 1A), which has the most well-established warhead (21.Saghatelian A. Jessani N. Joseph A. Humphrey M. Cravatt B.F. Activity-based probes for the proteomic profiling of metalloproteases.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Probe 1 was incubated with human endometriotic epithelial (12Z) cell lysate (10 μg) spiked with various concentrations of MMP-2, and then photocross-linked to the bound proteins. Dose-dependent ABP labeling of recombinant MMP-2 was observed by biotin immunoblot, suggesting that the probe linker modification did not interfere with active protein labeling by the ABP, and was effective in the presence of complex background proteins in the cell lysates (Fig. 1B). An additional study was performed to check the sensitivity limits and selective release of active proteases from solid support. In these screens, active MMP-2 from 30 ng of recombinant protein was confidently identified in the background of cell lysate using ABPP-MudPIT (Fig. 1B). The detection sensitivity in biological samples is expected to be even greater as, in this experimental system, activity of the commercially available MMP-2 catalytic domain is known to be very low, and TIMPs present in the cell lysate (28.Chen C.H. Miller M.A. Sarkar A. Beste M.T. Isaacson K.B. Lauffenburger Da Griffith L.G. Han J. Multiplexed protease activity assay for low-volume clinical samples using droplet-based microfluidics and its application to endometriosis.J. Am. Chem.

Bovine calf cartilage explants (Fig. 2A) were cultured for 30 days in the presence or absence of IL-1α (10 ng/ml) (29.Stevens A.L. Wishnok J.S. White F.M. Grodzinsky A.J. Tannenbaum S.R.

Conditioned medium was collected every 2–3 days and pooled into three 10-day averaged samples, concentrated, and normalized to total protein (Fig. 2A). Consistent with earlier reports of MMP activity (30.Dickinson S.C. Vankemmelbeke M.N. Buttle D.J. Rosenberg K. Heinegård D. Hollander A.P.

Rasmussen F.H. Fluorescent substrates for the proteinases ADAM17, ADAM10, ADAM8, and ADAM12 useful for high-throughput inhibitor screening.Anal.

The specific peptide probe chosen for this screen was efficiently cleaved by a variety of MMPs, especially MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-13, and reliably represents average MMP activity in a given sample (18.Miller M.A. Barkal L.

Protease activity was suppressed by the addition of a mixture of the three newly designed ABPs (Fig. 2C), demonstrating their potent inhibitory efficiency via MMP active site binding. To visualize the labeling pattern of ABPs, the explant culture medium samples were incubated with ABPs, photocross-linked, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, where biotin-labeled proteins were visualized using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Fig. 2D). As expected, greater protease activity correlated with greater ABP-mediated biotin labeling of active proteases (22.Sieber S.A. Niessen S. Hoover H.S. Cravatt B.F. Proteomic profiling of metalloprotease activities with cocktails of active-site probes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2 (16565715): 274-28110.1038/nchembio781Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Biotin-labeled proteins in control samples were below the detection limit, indicating minimal association of the ABPs with metalloprotease active sites, whereas the IL-1α–treated explant culture medium contained an increasing amount of biotin-labeled active proteases over time. Notably, active protease concentrations detected by biotin immunoblot correlated with the protease activity detected in the quenched-FRET substrate cleavage assay (Fig. 2C). We used our new ABPs in an ABPP-MudPIT approach to identify specific active proteases within the treated and untreated pooled explant medium samples. Concentrated samples were first covalently labeled with the ABPs; after pulldown with avidin beads and TCEP-mediated cleavage, the released proteases were digested and tryptic peptides were subjected to multidimensional LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) analysis using spectral counting. ABPP-MudPIT detection identified active metalloproteases in all three of the IL-1α–treated samples but not in untreated samples (Fig. 3, A and B). MMP-3 was the only active enzyme identified in the day 10 IL-1α–treated sample. Day 20 and 30 IL-1α–treated samples contained many more active MMPs including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-12. MMP-13 was also detected in day 20 IL-1-α–treated samples. We confirmed ABPP-MudPIT identification of active MMP-2 by immunoblot. After ABP labeling of day 20 untreated and day 20 IL-1α–treated pooled medium, pulled down proteins were cleaved from the agarose beads and detected with an MMP-2 antibody. Consistent with the ABPP-MudPIT analysis, MMP-2 was observed only in the IL-1α–treated samples (Fig. S3, lane 2 versus lane 1). The enrichment of the lower molecular weight form of MMP-2 by ABP pulldown, rather than the higher molecular weight form of MMP-2 prominent in the unprocessed IL-1α–treated sample (Fig. S3, lane 2 versus lane 3), verified that the ABPs targeted the active form of MMP-2. The enrichment of MMP-2 from the explant sample demonstrates the feasibility of the ABPP-MudPIT-labeled protein analysis approach to identify specific proteases in complex samples, but also introduce the potential for using ABP labeling and selective release to recover whole labeled proteins for additional further characterization, such as glycosylation patterns and other post-translational processing that may affect apparent activity. We next performed a shotgun proteomic analysis based on LC-MS/MS for global characterization of the proteases present in the explant culture medium. Proteases were first digested and then separated by off-gel electrophoresis. The pre-separated fractions were run on LC-MS/MS to determine the total amount of MMPs in the medium. Comparing spectral counts for each MMP in the IL-1α–treated and untreated culture medium samples, we found that total MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12, and MMP-13 released into explant culture medium was higher in IL-1α–treated samples, with MMP-3 and MMP-9 demonstrating marked decreases and increases, respectively, during the 30-day culture period (Fig. 4). In contrast, MMP-2 total protein levels remained relatively constant across the untreated and IL-1α–treated samples. Comparing active protease profiles from ABPP-MudPIT with the total protease profiles quantified by shotgun proteomics suggested that a significant fraction of the total secreted proteases is inactive, either as zymogens or endogenously inhibited by TIMPs. This excess of inactive proteases presented an opportunity to definitively validate the specificity and sensitivity of the modified ABPP-MudPIT approach to detect active metalloproteases. We incubated the untreated and IL-1α–treated culture medium samples with the chemical activator 4-aminophenyl mercuric acetate (APMA), along with our multifunctional ABPs (31.Keow J.Y. Pond E.D. Cisar J.S. Cravatt B.F. Crawford B.D.

We then examined the association of HMGB1 level and outcome, and the associations of rhTM with HMGB1 level and outcome in 19 patients who were treated with rhTM (rhTM group) and 11 patients who were not (control group). Results Data from 36 AE-FIP patients (mean age, 73.5±6.7years) were analyzed. Serum HMGB1 level was significantly higher in patients with AE-FIP than in those with stable idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (16.4±13.5 vs 5.7±2.6 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.003). HMGB1 was significantly lower on day 7 than at AE-FIP onset in survivors (6.5±4.8 vs 14.7±12.9 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.02) but not in nonsurvivors (14.6±10.5 vs 9.2±4.8 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.08). Although HMGB1 level at day 7 was significantly lower after rhTM treatment than at AE-FIP onset (8.4±6.1 vs 15.2±12.5 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.02), it did not significantly decrease in patients receiving treatments other than rhTM (11.3±11.3 vs 8.3±5.3 ng/ml, respectively; p = 0.37). Three-month survival was 60.0% in the rhTM group and 36.4% in the control group (p = 0.449). In multivariate analysis, a decrease in HMGB1 was a significant independent predictor of 3-month survival (Odds ratio, 12.4; p = 0.007). Conclusion rhTM lowers serum HMGB1 level and may improve survival after AE-FIP. HMGB1 may be a promising therapeutic target for AE-FIP."

We therefore sought to determine the prevalence of syndemic health problems in a cohort of Ontario nPEP patients, and explored the relationship between syndemic burden and HIV risk. Methods Between 07/2013-08/2016, we distributed a self-administered questionnaire to patients presenting to three clinics in Toronto and Ottawa seeking nPEP for sexual HIV exposures. We used validated screening tools to estimate the prevalence of depression (CES-D score ≥16), harmful alcohol use (AUDIT ≥8), problematic drug use (DUDIT ≥6 men/≥2 women), and sexual compulsivity (SCS ≥24) among men who have sex with men (MSM) respondents. In exploratory analyses, we examined the relationships between syndemic conditions using univariable logistic regression models, and the relationship between syndemic count (total number of syndemic conditions per participant) and HIV risk, as estimated by the HIRI-MSM score, using linear regression models. Results The 186 MSM included in the analysis had median age 31 (IQR = 26–36), including 87.6% having a college/undergraduate degree or higher. Overall, 53.8% screened positive for depression, 34.4% for harmful alcohol use, 30.1% for problematic drug use, and 16.1% for sexual compulsivity. Most participants (74.2%) had at least one syndemic condition and 46.8% had more than one. Exploratory analyses suggested positive associations between depression and harmful alcohol use (OR = 2.11, 95%CI = 1.13, 3.94) and between harmful alcohol use and problematic drug use (OR = 1.22, 95%CI = 0.65, 2.29). Syndemic count was associated with increased HIRI-MSM risk scores in univariable (2.2, 95%CI = 1.0, 3.3 per syndemic condition) and multivariable (2.1, 95%CI = 0.6, 3.6) linear regression models. Conclusions The prevalence of syndemic conditions in MSM seeking nPEP for sexual exposure is alarmingly high, and is associated with underlying HIV risk. Routine screening for these conditions may identify opportunities for intervention and could alleviate future vulnerability to HIV."

These transcription factors control gene expression to regulate such diverse processes as antibiotic resistance, stress response, aromatic carbon source catabolism, and virulence. An analysis of 19 major families of bacterial transcription factors recently implicated the MarR family as a significant contributor, comprising roughly 8% of the total proteins analyzed. With nearly 130,000 deposited bacterial genomes to date, many MarR family members have been and will be annotated as such; however, less than 1% of these sequences have been fully characterized with respect to physiological function.

Most MarR homologs act as gene repressors, and a typical organization of the locus orients the marR gene distally from the genes that are under transcriptional control. The intergenic region, typically at sites that overlap the −10 and −35 promoter elements, contains a 16- to 20-bp palindromic DNA sequence that harbors the binding site for the transcriptional regulator. Binding of a MarR homodimer to this palindromic region represses expression of both the gene that is regulated as well as the repressor itself. Dissociation of the repressor from DNA and activation of gene expression occurs when binding of a small-molecule ligand alters the conformation of the MarR homodimer. As a result of this autoregulated expression, the physiological concentrations of the repressor itself change very slightly, allowing for an exceptionally sensitive response to ligand concentrations. Structural studies of MarR homologs reveal two sets of N- and C-terminal α-helices that facilitate dimerization and two winged helix–turn–helix motifs (wHTH) that bind to the palindromic DNA duplex via spacing that is established by dimer formation. Each monomer binds to one half-site of the palindromic DNA inverted repeat sequence, and residues along the dimerization interface help to establish the spacing between the two half-sites. Disruption of dimer formation results in a loss in DNA binding affinity and a loss of the corresponding drug resistance phenotype. A clade of MarR members responds to oxidative stress through the oxidation of Cys residues, which results in change to a conformation that is incompatible with DNA binding. Biochemical and biophysical studies of MarR family members are limited by the low binding affinity for cognate ligands, which often results in confounding data. For example, several small-molecule ligands can bind to MarR factors at multiple sites, and the physiological relevance of these interactions is unclear (8Chang Y.-M. Jeng W.-Y. Ko T.-P. Yeh Y.-J.

In R. palustris, the transcription of an operon that encodes for enzymes involved in the catabolism of p-coumarate to p-hydroxybenzoate is under the control of a MarR family regulator named CouR. Recombinant CouR was shown to bind to an inverted repeated sequence in the −10 region of the promoter, and DNA binding was disrupted by addition of low micromolar concentrations of p-coumaroyl–CoA (pCC) (Fig. 1, B and C) (1Hirakawa H.

An orthologous pathway for aromatic acid catabolism has been identified in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, which also utilizes a similar strategy of CoA-thioesterification, followed by β-oxidative deacetylation to generate hydroxybenzoates. However, the constituent enzymes encoded by this operon are different from those of R. palustris. For example, the R. jostii RHA1 cluster encodes an aryl-CoA dehydrogenase and an aryl-CoA ligase (CouL) that can utilize dihydroferulate as a substrate, suggesting that the pathway functions on dihydro-p-hydroxycinnamic acids rather than their unsaturated p-hydroxycinnamate counterparts. Last, although the MarR family repressor that regulates the R. jostii RHA1 operon has been named CouR, the sequence identity of this polypeptide to R. palustris CouR is only 36%, and the DNA-binding site is divergent in sequence and size, as it contains a 5-nucleotide (nt) spacer between the two half-sites rather than the 3-nt spacer in the R. palustris promoter (13Otani H. Stogios P.J. Xu X. Nocek B. Li S.N. Savchenko A. Eltis L.D. The activity of CouR, a MarR family transcriptional regulator, is modulated through a novel molecular mechanism.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44 (26400178): 595-60710.1093/nar/gkv955Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The R. palustris CouR represents a rare example of a MarR family regulator for which a physiologically relevant ligand has been verified, and the cognate ligand is shown to bind to the receptor with low micromolar affinity. Competition studies indicate that only pCC (and not p-coumarate, benzoyl-CoA, or acetyl-CoA) can induce dissociation of CouR from its promoter DNA. To elucidate the mechanism for recognition of the target promoter and how binding of a large ligand affects protein–DNA interactions to relieve transcriptional repression, we determined the cocrystal structures of CouR in complex with a 23-nt duplex inverted repeat corresponding to the physiological DNA binding site (to 2.85-Å resolution, Fig. 2A) and the corresponding structure of the repressor in the inactive state, bound to pCC (to 2.1-Å resolution; Fig. 3, A and B). The function of specific amino acids in DNA or ligand recognition were probed by analysis of structure-based site-specific variants using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs, for DNA binding) or differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) assays (for ligand binding). The combined biochemical and structural biological data provide a framework for understanding transcriptional regulation by CouR, which further extends the existing knowledge of MarR family repressors.Figure 3CouR–pCC cocrystal structure and summary of DSF binding constants. A, simulated annealing difference Fourier map (Fo-Fc) contoured at 3σ reveals an electron density corresponding to pCC (dark khaki) bound to CouR. Each ligand is embedded in a hydrophobic cleft comprised of residues from both monomers of the homodimer (colored either plum or sky blue). Additional residues from the monomer in plum engage the phosphopantetheine group of pCC (i.e. Thr-76, Ile-103, and Asn-107). The electron density corresponding to the adenine ring is spurious.

Altering the length and identity of the nucleotides flanking the recognition sequence finally produced crystals that diffracted to 2.85-Å resolution at an insertion device synchrotron beamline. Structures of ligand-free CouR and a complex with synthetic pCC each produced crystals that diffracted to 2.1-Å resolution. Because of ease of reproducibility, structure determination focused on using crystals of the CouR–DNA complex, and crystallographic phases were determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method from data collected on crystals of selenomethionine-labeled CouR. The apo-CouR and CouR-pCC structures were determined by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the polypeptide from the DNA-bound structure, followed by manual rebuilding of the polypeptide. The overall structure of the CouR homodimer is triangular in shape with a pseudo 2-fold axis of symmetry. Each monomer consists of six α-helices and two β-strands containing a wHTH motif, where helices α3-α4 and strands β1-β2 define the DNA binding elements (Fig. 1, A and D). Dimerization between the two monomers is mediated by interlocking interactions between helices α1, α5, and α6 from each monomer, resulting in a burial of 4,487–4,497 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area (depending on the conformational state). Dimerization between the two monomers is mediated by extensive burial of numerous hydrophobic residues to form the structural core. Residues at this interface include Leu-51, Leu-55, Val-62, and Phe-66 from helix α1; Val-152, Leu-160, and Leu-164 from helix α5; and Leu-172, Leu-176, and Ile-179 from helix α6. Additional interactions include intramolecular (Asp-65–Arg-159) as well as intermolecular (Glu-46–Lys-149 and Glu-49–Arg-169) salt bridges. Most notably, electron density is sparse for the β-strands that contain the wHTH motif, and the wings show a different conformation for each of the two monomers. There is also weak density in the presumptive binding pocket for one of the monomers, which may reflect a weakly bound molecule of HEPES from the buffer component, but this was too poorly defined and not modeled. A DALI search of the CouR monomer against the Protein Data Bank reveals a strong conservation of secondary structural elements with other transcriptional regulators. The closest homologs include a putative regulator of unknown function from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB code 2NNN, Z score of 17.5, RMSD of 1.4 Å over 133 aligned Cα atoms), the Streptomyces coelicolor β-ketoadipate regulator PcaV (PDB code 4FHT, Z score of 17.1, RMSD of 2.7 Å over 141 aligned Cα atoms), E. coli MarR (PDB code 3VOE, Z score of 17.1, RMSD of 2.7 Å over 136 aligned Cα atoms), and the multidrug efflux regulator MexR from P. aeruginosa (PDB code 1LNW, Z score of 17.1, RMSD of 1.7 Å over 140 aligned Cα atoms). The cocrystal structure of CouR bound to a 23-bp duplex bearing the two half-sites was determined to 2.85-Å resolution from crystals containing two copies of the CouR dimer–DNA duplex complex in the asymmetric unit (ASU). The CouR homodimer is situated on the pseudo-palindromic duplex so that helix α4 from the wHTH motif is positioned into each of the two half-sites along consecutive major grooves that are roughly 34 Å apart. The DNA duplex is roughly B-form but is under-twisted by 1.3°, resulting in a shortening of the end-to-end distance by roughly 3.8 Å, relative to canonical B-DNA. Notably, these deviations arise from a widening of the major grooves, to accommodate binding of the CouR α4 recognition helix, and a corresponding slight narrowing of the minor groove (Fig. 2). Each CouR monomer contacts each half of the inverted repeat sequence through interactions with the wHTH motif, with the α4 helix positioned in the major groove and strands β1-β2 of the wHTH making contacts with nucleotides on the outer periphery of the recognition sites. As in other structures of MarR family regulators in complex with their cognate operator sequences, the number of contacts between CouR and DNA bases of the inverted repeat is limited. The only base-specific interaction occurs at helix α4 between the carboxamide of Asn-107 and N6 and N7 of A15. Van der Waals contacts with DNA bases of the recognition sequence are mediated via the wedging of Pro-106 into the segment encompassing T6-T7-A8 of one strand and the corresponding bases of the complementary strand. The Pro-106–Asn-107 sequence comprises the first two residues of the α4 helix, and the combination of extensive van der Waals contacts and sequence-specific interactions mediated through these two residues establish the orientation of the recognition helix within the major groove of each half site. The wing portion of the DNA-binding region, spanning residues Val-122 through Leu-135 (from strands β1-β2), mediates additional contacts with nucleotides at the periphery of the recognition sequence. Electron density for both strands as well as for the intervening loop is clear and continuous in the DNA cocrystal structure. Residues within the loop of this region are situated in the minor groove and are involved in extensive nonspecific contacts with the DNA backbone. The phosphate backbone of the DNA duplex is within hydrogen bonding distance of several residues, including the side chains of Arg-123, Arg-125, Arg-130, Arg-131, Ser-132, and His-133, as well as the main chain carbonyl of Ser-128. The side chain of Arg-131 is poised within hydrogen-bonding distance of T3, but this nucleotide is outside of the recognition half-site and is not part of the inverted repeat sequence of the naturally occurring couA operator. Arg-131 interacts with the side chain carboxylate of Asp-129 via a salt bridge, and this Asp-X-Arg pairing, along with a similar interaction with thymine, is observed across various MarR family members (13Otani H.

Outside of interactions with the wHTH motif, there are a few additional residues that make contact with the DNA backbone. Specifically, the side chain of Lys-56 (equivalent to Arg-10 in MepR and Tyr-19 in OhrR) from helix α1 is situated directly above the phosphate of T14, which is located at the inner periphery of the inverted repeat. As a result, interactions between equivalent Lys-56 residues from each monomer occur at either side of the minor groove. In the CouR cocrystal structure, Asn-107 makes direct interactions with the A15 nucleobase, and equivalent residues in MepR (Thr-63) and OhrR (Thr-70) are also involved in base pair recognition. Last, Gln-94 (equivalent to Gln-50 in MepR) is located in helix α3 and is part of a framework of interactions with the phosphate of T6, which also engages Arg-123 and His-133 from each of the strands of the wing (for a detailed CouR–DNA interaction map, see Fig. S4). To probe the CouR–DNA contacts in detail, we generated site-specific variants corresponding to a number of residues within the α4 helix, the β1-β2 wing, and two residues located outside of these elements and probed the effects of each mutation on DNA binding using EMSAs (Fig. 2D). Four distinct bands are observed when the couA promoter fragment is presented with CouR, corresponding to four distinct oligomeric states, with the highest mobility band corresponding to free DNA. The presence of two bands observed at high protein concentrations (i.e. 8 pmol lanes for CouR WT and Asn-107→Ala in Fig. 2D) is likely a result of quaternary interactions between CouR–couA promoter complexes under nondenaturing conditions. Mutation of the highly conserved Arg-131 to Ala completely abolished DNA-binding activity, as observed previously in studies of the S. aureus multidrug resistance regulator MepR (17Birukou I. Seo S.M. Schindler B.D. Kaatz G.W. Brennan R.G. Structural mechanism of transcription regulation of the Staphylococcus aureus multidrug efflux operon mepRA by the MarR family repressor MepR.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42 (24293644): 2774-278810.1093/nar/gkt1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This result is reconciled by the crystal structure as numerous contacts are made between Arg-131 and the minor groove of the DNA binding partner. The Arg-130→Ala variant also shows a significant reduction in DNA binding, reflecting the multiple roles this residue plays as both part of the Asp-X-Arg pairing common across MarR members as well as facilitating interactions with the phosphate backbone. Notably, Arg-130 is not conserved across other orthologs, and its provision in DNA interactions may be unique to CouR (Fig. 1D). Other notable residues identified in the EMSA as important for binding include Lys-56 and Arg-125, which form electrostatic interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone, and Gln-94, which interacts with the phosphate group of T6 (Fig. 2D and Fig. S4). Alanine mutations at these residues resulted in observable decreases in the formation of higher-molecular-weight complexes. The modest effect of the Gln-94→Ala variant suggests that, although the DNA interaction mediated by this residue is important, it is not absolutely essential. Notably, the Asn-107→Ala variant results in a mobility shift commensurate with WT CouR, suggesting that the base pair interaction is not important for binding. CouR was observed to bind pCC in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio without disruption of the homodimeric interface also observed in the ligand-free CouR and CouR–DNA cocrystal structures (Fig. 3, A and B). The ligand-free and pCC-bound structures are very similar, demonstrating that binding of the ligand does not cause any appreciable changes in global or local structure of CouR (Fig. 4A). A major difference between the two structures is reflected in the orientation of the β-strands of the wHTH motif, which are partially disordered in the ligand-free structure but are well-resolved in the pCC-bound structure. Moreover, the strands of each monomer in the pCC-bound structure are nearly superimposable, suggesting that ligand binding may restrict the flexibility of these strands. Recognition of pCC appears to be driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions between the coumaroyl moiety of pCC and one of two equivalent clefts (one per monomer) in addition to some hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions along the pantetheine group of pCC. The cleft exists adjacent to the dimeric interface surrounded by residues from helices α1, α2, and α5 (e.g. Phe-63, Phe-66, Pro-77, and Phe-80) of one monomer in addition to residues from helix α1 (e.g. Leu-47 and Tyr-53) of its neighboring monomer comprising the homodimer. CouR residue Asn-107, which is involved in base pair recognition of A15 of the operator, also interacts with a backbone amide of pCC. The location and secondary structural composition of this hydrophobic cleft is analogous to those observed in structures of MarR family members bound to various phenolic acids and aldehyde ligands lacking CoA (3Davis J.R.

Sufficient electron density was observed to model four pCCs bound to four CouR monomers in the crystallographic ASU. Additional interactions near the opening of the cleft include hydrophobic contacts between the side chain of Ile-103 and the geminal dimethyl group of pCC as well as hydrogen bonding between the side chain of Thr-76 and the β-phosphate of pCC (Fig. 3A).

https://openalex.org/W2803176031,"Objective To facilitate precise local ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a setting of combined ablation and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), we evaluated accuracy and efficiency of a novel technique for navigated positioning of ablation probes using intrahepatic tumor referencing and electromagnetic (EM) guidance, in a porcine model. Methods An angiographic wire with integrated EM reference sensor at its tip was inserted via a transarterial femoral access and positioned in the vicinity of artificial liver tumors. The resulting offset distance between the tumor center and the intrahepatic endovascular EM reference was calculated. Subsequently, EM tracked ablation probes were inserted percutaneously and navigated toward the tumor center, relying on continuous EM guidance via the intrahepatic reference. Targeting accuracy was assessed as the Euclidean distance between the tip of the ablation probe and the tumor center (Target Positioning Error, TPE). Procedural efficiency was assessed as time efforts for tumor referencing and tumor targeting. Results In 6 animals, 124 targeting measurements were performed with an offset distance < 30 mm (clinically most feasible position), resulting in a mean TPE of 2.9 ± 1.6 mm. No significant correlation between the TPE and different intrahepatic offset distances (range 21 to 61 mm, n = 365) was shown as long as the EM reference was placed within the liver. However, the mean TPE increased when placing the EM reference externally on the animal skin (p < 0.01). TPE was similar when targeting under continuous ventilation or in apnea (p = 0.50). Mean time for tumor referencing and navigated targeting was 6.5 ± 3.8 minutes and 14 ± 8 seconds, respectively. Conclusion The proposed technique allows precise and efficient navigated positioning of ablation probes into liver tumors in the animal model. We introduce a simple approach suitable for combined ablation and TACE of HCC in a single treatment session."

https://openalex.org/W2804698201,"Glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes are involved in a two-stage detoxification process of a wide range of environmental toxins, carcinogens and xenobiotics. The GST enzymes play important roles in oxidative stress pathways, and polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes mediate susceptibility and outcome in different diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with oxidative stress, but there is limited data on the frequency of deleted GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in HIV/AIDS patients and their effect on progression among Ghanaians. This study sought to investigate the association between homozygous deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes (both null deletion) with HIV/AIDS disease progression in Ghanaian patients. HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART), ART-naive HIV patients, and HIV seronegative individuals were recruited for the study. HIV/AIDS disease progression was assessed by measuring CD4+ cell count and viral load of the patients, and GST polymorphism was determined by amplifying the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes using multiplex PCR, with CYP1A1 gene as an internal control. The mean CD4+ count of patients that were naive to ART (298 ± 243 cells/mm3) was significantly lower than that of patients on ART (604 ± 294 cells/mm3), and viral load was significantly lower in the ART-experienced group (30379 ± 15073 copies/mm3) compared to the ART-naive group (209882 ± 75045 copies/mm3). Frequencies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions were shown to be 21.9% and 19.8%, respectively, in the HIV patients, and patients with homozygous deletion of both GSTM1 and GSTT1 were more likely to have their CD4+ count rising above 350 cells/mm3 (OR = 6.44, 95% CI = 0.81-51.49, p = 0.039) suggesting that patients with homozygous deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes have slower disease progression. The findings of this study show that double deletion of glutathione S-transferases M1 and T1 is statistically associated with normal CD4+ count in patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Further study is required to investigate the clinical importance of the both null deletion in HIV patients."
https://openalex.org/W2804760358,"Impairment of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is considered a key contributor to the development of age-related macular degeneration. Apoptosis-related protein 3 (APR3) was recently discovered after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, a pivotal molecule in RPE cells. However, the function of APR3 remains poorly understood. In the present study, we found that APR3 could interact with nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, which is a regulator of phase II enzymes, and that knockdown of APR3 promoted nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 nuclear translocation and activated expression of phase II enzymes, which was accompanied by improved redox status and mitochondrial activity. Overexpression of APR3 revealed its mitochondrial localization and induced a robust production of reactive oxygen species that was accompanied by impaired mitochondrial oxygen consump tion, complex activity, and lower ATP content, resulting in significant changes in mitochondrial structure, which may contribute to cell apoptosis. High doses of all-trans retinoic acid treatment were found to significantly induce APR3 expression, increase reactive oxygen species levels, and decrease ATP content, which were abolished by knockdown of APR3. These results indicate that APR3 plays a vital role in regulating redox status and mitochondrial activity and thus suggest APR3 might be a potential novel target for study of treatment of age-related macular degeneration.—Li, Y., Zou, X., Gao, J., Cao, K., Feng, Z., Liu, J.

Objective The objective of the present investigation was to determine the cross-sectional relevance of restrained eating for characteristics of circadian eating pattern in adolescents and whether changes in restrained eating are accompanied by concurrent changes in circadian eating pattern over the course of adolescence. Methods Two questionnaires assessing restrained eating (Score 0–30) with parallel 3-day weighed dietary records from two different time points were available from 209 (♂:101, ♀:108) 11–18 year old adolescents of the DONALD study. Mixed linear regression models were used to analyze whether restrained eating was associated with eating occasion frequency, snack frequency and morning and evening energy intake [in % of daily energy intake, %E]. Linear regression models were used to examine whether changes in restrained eating were associated with changes in the mentioned variables. Results Among girls, greater restrained eating was cross-sectionally associated with higher morning energy intake (p = 0.03). Further, there was a tendency towards lower evening energy intake with higher levels of restrained eating for the whole sample (p = 0.06). No cross-sectional associations were found with eating occasion or snack frequency. Each one-point increase in restrained eating during adolescence was related to a concurrent decrease in eating occasion frequency by 0.04 (95% CI -0.08; -0.01, p = 0.02) and in evening energy intake by 0.36%E (95% CI -0.70; -0.03, p = 0.04). A tendency towards decreasing snack frequency with increasing restrained eating was observed (β = -0.03, 95% CI -0.07; 0.00, p = 0.07). No association was found between changes in restrained eating and concurrent changes in morning energy intake. Conclusion We found indications for cross-sectional and prospective associations between restrained eating and chronobiological aspects of food intake in adolescents. Our results suggest that restrained eating should be considered a relevant determinant of circadian eating patterns."
