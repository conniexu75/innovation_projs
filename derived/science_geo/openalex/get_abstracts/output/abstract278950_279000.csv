https://openalex.org/W2054153956,"The direction of evolution may at times be determined by the internal selection of genotypes during development, rather than by the external selection of phenotypes. Biological theory and experiment have reached the point where those concerned with evolutionary problems or with nuclear and cellular organization should consider this possibility."

https://openalex.org/W2065632783,"The synthetic, basic poly-Î±-amino acid, polylysine, had antifungal activity against plant pathogens (three strains of fusaria, three isolates of verticillia, and Ceratocystis fimbriata) and against the human pathogens (Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, and Candida albicans) in vitro. It inhibited penetration of Ceratocystis fimbriata on sweet potato slices. Polylysine inhibited the infection of tomato cuttings by Fusarium oxysporum f. lycopersici, but it was also toxic to the plants."

https://openalex.org/W1995250302,"The water-soluble substance occurring in high concentration (up to 6 percent of the dry weight) in Mnium affine Bland. and forming the main fraction of the plant acids there, has been identified as trans-aconitic acid by nine different criteria. Evidence is presented in favor of the concept that the trans form in this case is the natural isomer and not an artifact derived from cis-aconitic acid. Information is given on the distribution of aconitic acid in other mosses and in liverworts."
https://openalex.org/W1995730983,"A method of estimation of oil and gas resources prior to drilling described by M.F. Uman, W.R. James, H.R. Tomlinson, Science, 205, 489 (1979) is criticized as a very complicated process which has led to very inexact estimations of reserves for a series of tracts on the federal Outer Continental Shelf off the Gulf Coast. It is suggested that alternative procedures should be investigated to determine if improved forecasts can be made, and a method of forecasting based on regressing the oil and gas volumes of known reservoirs onto seismically preceivable variables is suggested.
