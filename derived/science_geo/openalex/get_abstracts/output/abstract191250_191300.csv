https://openalex.org/W2069684807,"THE human blood-group system called Kidd was discovered in 1951 by Allen, Diamond and Niedziela1, who found an antibody, anti-Jka, which distinguished two phenotypes, Jk(a+) and Jk(a−). Family investigations2 showed that the antigen Jka is inherited and that the gene Jka is capable of expressing itself in single and in double dose; the existence of an allelomorphic gene Jkb was assumed. In tests on 390 unrelated persons2, the phenotype frequencies were Jk(a+) 76.92 per cent and Jk(a−) 23.08 per cent, from which the following gene and genotype frequencies were calculated:"

Normally, they are reared in water of pH 7.30 ± 0.05 at 10.5° C. The pH value of the yolk in living eggs and larvæ is 6.50–6.55, and after death it has the same pH value as that of the surrounding water. As a starting point for an investigation of the effect of different pH values on eggs and larvæ, they were reared in tap water adjusted to different pH's with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Such a system would not remain at constant pH. Since it was found that a particular quantity of water in a glass vessel containing fifty eggs did not change its pH in 6 hr. by more than 1.0 towards the acid side, the water of the experimental container was replaced after 6 hr. with fresh water adjusted to the original pH. Buffer solutions were not used to avoid the action of other ions. All the containers were kept in the same hatchery tray at a constant temperature of 10.5° ± 0.5°C., and each container received 50 eggs. The larvæ need more oxygen and give out more carbon dioxide than the same number of eggs, so the quantity of water in each container was increased to five times the original to ensure the proper aeration of the larvæ. A simple average of the mortality percentage of four experiments is shown in the graph. All pH values were measured with a glass electrode and Cambridge pH-meter at 10.5° C."

https://openalex.org/W2063664310,"THE guppy, Lebistes reticulatus, is a viviparous fish the reproductive physiology of which has been well studied (bibliography in Gordon1). A female, D9, of English domestic stock of this species born October 5, 1950, was separated from adult males twelve days after birth. The litter of which she was a member were placed in separate jars when thirty-nine days old. The first sign of differentiation of the anal fin into a gonopodium was seen in one of her brothers twelve days later, the family being raised at 20° C. The isolated female, at the age of 216 days, bore a female offspring which died at the age of 304 days. The mother was then mated to a male litter-mate, and bore four litters of at least twenty-six, of which twenty-four were females and one male. The male mated with D9 died before the birth of the second litter, consisting of seven females and one male which were separated from each other at the age of four days. One of these females, DD20, gave birth to three young at the age of 193 days."

The members of one pair lie dorso-laterally, those of the other pair laterally. On the mid-ventral surface of the larval mantle is a longitudinal thickening of ciliated cells some 70 µ long and reaching to the hind edge. Two bands of muscle fibres pass forward inside the larval pedicle and are finally inserted one each side of the mid-dorsal line of the base of the mantle."
