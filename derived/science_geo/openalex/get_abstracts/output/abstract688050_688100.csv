https://openalex.org/W4210589143,"The adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reprogrammed to target tumour cells has demonstrated potential for treatment of various cancers1-7. However, little is known about the long-term potential and clonal stability of the infused cells. Here we studied long-lasting CD19-redirected chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia1-4 who achieved a complete remission in 2010. CAR T cells remained detectable more than ten years after infusion, with sustained remission in both patients. Notably, a highly activated CD4+ population emerged in both patients, dominating the CAR T cell population at the later time points. This transition was reflected in the stabilization of the clonal make-up of CAR T cells with a repertoire dominated by a small number of clones. Single-cell profiling demonstrated that these long-persisting CD4+ CAR T cells exhibited cytotoxic characteristics along with ongoing functional activation and proliferation. In addition, longitudinal profiling revealed a population of gamma delta CAR T cells that prominently expanded in one patient concomitant with CD8+ CAR T cells during the initial response phase. Our identification and characterization of these unexpected CAR T cell populations provide novel insight into the CAR T cell characteristics associated with anti-cancer response and long-term remission in leukaemia."
https://openalex.org/W4210782186,"Genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with hundreds of genes spanning a wide range of biological functions1-6. The alterations in the human brain resulting from mutations in these genes remain unclear. Furthermore, their phenotypic manifestation varies across individuals7,8. Here we used organoid models of the human cerebral cortex to identify cell-type-specific developmental abnormalities that result from haploinsufficiency in three ASD risk genes-SUV420H1 (also known as KMT5B), ARID1B and CHD8-in multiple cell lines from different donors, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of more than 745,000 cells and proteomic analysis of individual organoids, to identify phenotypic convergence. Each of the three mutations confers asynchronous development of two main cortical neuronal lineages-γ-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) neurons and deep-layer excitatory projection neurons-but acts through largely distinct molecular pathways. Although these phenotypes are consistent across cell lines, their expressivity is influenced by the individual genomic context, in a manner that is dependent on both the risk gene and the developmental defect. Calcium imaging in intact organoids shows that these early-stage developmental changes are followed by abnormal circuit activity. This research uncovers cell-type-specific neurodevelopmental abnormalities that are shared across ASD risk genes and are finely modulated by human genomic context, finding convergence in the neurobiological basis of how different risk genes contribute to ASD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W4210362116,"Gasdermins, a family of five pore-forming proteins (GSDMA–GSDME) in humans expressed predominantly in the skin, mucosa and immune sentinel cells, are key executioners of inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis), which recruits immune cells to infection sites and promotes protective immunity1,2. Pore formation is triggered by gasdermin cleavage1,2. Although the proteases that activate GSDMB, C, D and E have been identified, how GSDMA—the dominant gasdermin in the skin—is activated, remains unknown. Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a major skin pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide3. Here we show that the GAS cysteine protease SpeB virulence factor triggers keratinocyte pyroptosis by cleaving GSDMA after Gln246, unleashing an active N-terminal fragment that triggers pyroptosis. Gsdma1 genetic deficiency blunts mouse immune responses to GAS, resulting in uncontrolled bacterial dissemination and death. GSDMA acts as both a sensor and substrate of GAS SpeB and as an effector to trigger pyroptosis, adding a simple one-molecule mechanism for host recognition and control of virulence of a dangerous microbial pathogen. The Streptococcus pyogenes virulence factor SpeB triggers pyroptosis in keratinocytes by catalysing cleavage of host gasdermin A, a key event triggering the immune response to S. pyogenes infection."
https://openalex.org/W4210575300,"Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling, reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting these data, however, requires kinetic models capable of unveiling governing regulatory functions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework dynamo (https://github.com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release), which infers absolute RNA velocity, reconstructs continuous vector fields that predict cell fates, employs differential geometry to extract underlying regulations, and ultimately predicts optimal reprogramming paths and perturbation outcomes. We highlight dynamo’s power to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional splicing-based RNA velocity analyses to enable accurate velocity estimations on a metabolically labeled human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset. Furthermore, differential geometry analyses reveal mechanisms driving early megakaryocyte appearance and elucidate asymmetrical regulation within the PU.1-GATA1 circuit. Leveraging the least-action-path method, dynamo accurately predicts drivers of numerous hematopoietic transitions. Finally, in silico perturbations predict cell-fate diversions induced by gene perturbations. Dynamo, thus, represents an important step in advancing quantitative and predictive theories of cell-state transitions."
https://openalex.org/W4210297691,"The accurate identification of antitumor T cell receptors (TCRs) represents a major challenge for the engineering of cell-based cancer immunotherapies. By mapping 55 neoantigen-specific TCR clonotypes (NeoTCRs) from 10 metastatic human tumors to their single-cell transcriptomes, we identified signatures of CD8+ and CD4+ neoantigen-reactive tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Neoantigen-specific TILs exhibited tumor-specific expansion with dysfunctional phenotypes, distinct from blood-emigrant bystanders and regulatory TILs. Prospective prediction and testing of 73 NeoTCR signature-derived clonotypes demonstrated that half of the tested TCRs recognized tumor antigens or autologous tumors. NeoTCR signatures identified TCRs that target driver neoantigens and nonmutated viral or tumor-associated antigens, suggesting a common metastatic TIL exhaustion program. NeoTCR signatures delineate the landscape of TILs across metastatic tumors, enabling successful TCR prediction based purely on TIL transcriptomic states for use in cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4210396037,"Regulation of cytokine production in stimulated T cells can be disrupted in autoimmunity, immunodeficiencies, and cancer. Systematic discovery of stimulation-dependent cytokine regulators requires both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies, which have been challenging in primary human cells. We now report genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary human T cells to identify gene networks controlling interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. Arrayed CRISPRa confirmed key hits and enabled multiplexed secretome characterization, revealing reshaped cytokine responses. Coupling CRISPRa screening with single-cell RNA sequencing enabled deep molecular characterization of screen hits, revealing how perturbations tuned T cell activation and promoted cell states characterized by distinct cytokine expression profiles. These screens reveal genes that reprogram critical immune cell functions, which could inform the design of immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W3160230952,"The flow of water in carbon nanochannels has defied understanding thus far1, with accumulating experimental evidence for ultra-low friction, exceptionally high water flow rates and curvature-dependent hydrodynamic slippage2-5. In particular, the mechanism of water-carbon friction remains unknown6, with neither current theories7 nor classical8,9 or ab initio molecular dynamics simulations10 providing satisfactory rationalization for its singular behaviour. Here we develop a quantum theory of the solid-liquid interface, which reveals a new contribution to friction, due to the coupling of charge fluctuations in the liquid to electronic excitations in the solid. We expect that this quantum friction, which is absent in Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics, is the dominant friction mechanism for water on carbon-based materials. As a key result, we demonstrate a marked difference in quantum friction between the water-graphene and water-graphite interface, due to the coupling of water Debye collective modes with a thermally excited plasmon specific to graphite. This suggests an explanation for the radius-dependent slippage of water in carbon nanotubes4, in terms of the electronic excitations of the nanotubes. Our findings open the way for quantum engineering of hydrodynamic flows through the electronic properties of the confining wall."
https://openalex.org/W4210647337,"Methane emissions from oil and gas (O&G) production and transmission represent a considerable contribution to climate change. These emissions comprise sporadic releases of large amounts of methane during maintenance operations or equipment failures not accounted for in current inventory estimates. We collected and analyzed hundreds of very large releases from atmospheric methane images sampled by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) between 2019 and 2020. Ultra-emitters are primarily detected over the largest O&G basins throughout the world. With a total contribution equivalent to 8 to 12% (~8 million metric tons of methane per year) of the global O&G production methane emissions, mitigation of ultra-emitters is largely achievable at low costs and would lead to robust net benefits in billions of US dollars for the six major O&G-producing countries when considering societal costs of methane."
https://openalex.org/W4210461376,"Magnetic phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and indispensable for modern science and technology, but it is notoriously difficult to change the magnetic order of a material in a rapid way. However, if a thin nickel film is subjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it loses its magnetic order almost completely within femtosecond timescales1. This phenomenon is widespread2–7 and offers opportunities for rapid information processing8–11 or ultrafast spintronics at frequencies approaching those of light8,9,12. Consequently, the physics of ultrafast demagnetization is central to modern materials research1–7,13–28, but a crucial question has remained elusive: if a material loses its magnetization within mere femtoseconds, where is the missing angular momentum in such a short time? Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous, long-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency phonons that appear within 150–750 fs. The anisotropy plane is perpendicular to the direction of the initial magnetization and the atomic oscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations by means of circularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the angular momentum of the spin system before macroscopic sample rotation. The time that is needed for demagnetization is related to the time it takes to accelerate the atoms. These results provide an atomistic picture of the Einstein–de Haas effect and signify the general importance of polarized phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and phase transitions. Ultrafast electron diffraction is used here to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous, long-lasting population of anisotropic phonons with angular momentum."
https://openalex.org/W4210390196,"The discovery of N 6 -methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) across eukaryotes led to a search for additional epigenetic mechanisms. However, some studies have highlighted confounding factors that challenge the prevalence of 6mA in eukaryotes. We developed a metagenomic method to quantitatively deconvolve 6mA events from a genomic DNA sample into species of interest, genomic regions, and sources of contamination. Applying this method, we observed high-resolution 6mA deposition in two protozoa. We found that commensal or soil bacteria explained the vast majority of 6mA in insect and plant samples. We found no evidence of high abundance of 6mA in Drosophila , Arabidopsis , or humans. Plasmids used for genetic manipulation, even those from Dam methyltransferase mutant Escherichia coli , could carry abundant 6mA, confounding the evaluation of candidate 6mA methyltransferases and demethylases. On the basis of this work, we advocate for a reassessment of 6mA in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W4210483459,"The Dog Aging Project is a long-term longitudinal study of ageing in tens of thousands of companion dogs. The domestic dog is among the most variable mammal species in terms of morphology, behaviour, risk of age-related disease and life expectancy. Given that dogs share the human environment and have a sophisticated healthcare system but are much shorter-lived than people, they offer a unique opportunity to identify the genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors associated with healthy lifespan. To take advantage of this opportunity, the Dog Aging Project will collect extensive survey data, environmental information, electronic veterinary medical records, genome-wide sequence information, clinicopathology and molecular phenotypes derived from blood cells, plasma and faecal samples. Here, we describe the specific goals and design of the Dog Aging Project and discuss the potential for this open-data, community science study to greatly enhance understanding of ageing in a genetically variable, socially relevant species living in a complex environment. The Dog Aging Project is an open-data, community science study to identify genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors associated with canine healthy lifespan, generating knowledge that could readily translate to human ageing."

https://openalex.org/W4210532014,"Carbapenems are antibiotics of last resort in the clinic. Owing to their potency and broad-spectrum activity, they are an important part of the antibiotic arsenal. The vital role of carbapenems is exemplified by the approval acquired by Merck from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of an imipenem combination therapy to treat the increased levels of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia that have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic1. The C6 hydroxyethyl side chain distinguishes the clinically used carbapenems from the other classes of β-lactam antibiotics and is responsible for their low susceptibility to inactivation by occluding water from the β-lactamase active site2. The construction of the C6 hydroxyethyl side chain is mediated by cobalamin- or B12-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes3. These radical SAM methylases (RSMTs) assemble the alkyl backbone by sequential methylation reactions, and thereby underlie the therapeutic usefulness of clinically used carbapenems. Here we present X-ray crystal structures of TokK, a B12-dependent RSMT that catalyses three-sequential methylations during the biosynthesis of asparenomycin A. These structures, which contain the two metallocofactors of the enzyme and were determined in the presence and absence of a carbapenam substrate, provide a visualization of a B12-dependent RSMT that uses the radical mechanism that is shared by most of these enzymes. The structures provide insight into the stereochemistry of initial C6 methylation and suggest that substrate positioning governs the rate of each methylation event. X-ray crystal structures of TokK, a cobalamin- or B12-dependent radical SAM methylase, provide insight into how these enzymes use sequential radical-mediated methylations to assemble the C6 side chain of carbapenem antibiotics."
https://openalex.org/W4210639901,"Chloride transport by microbial rhodopsins is an essential process for which molecular details such as the mechanisms that convert light energy to drive ion pumping and ensure the unidirectionality of the transport have remained elusive. We combined time-resolved serial crystallography with time-resolved spectroscopy and multiscale simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a chloride-pumping rhodopsin and the structural dynamics throughout the transport cycle. We traced transient anion-binding sites, obtained evidence for how light energy is used in the pumping mechanism, and identified steric and electrostatic molecular gates ensuring unidirectional transport. An interaction with the π-electron system of the retinal supports transient chloride ion binding across a major bottleneck in the transport pathway. These results allow us to propose key mechanistic features enabling finely controlled chloride transport across the cell membrane in this light-powered chloride ion pump."
https://openalex.org/W4210468311,"To determine the impact of genetic variants on the brain, we used genetically informed brain atlases in genome-wide association studies of regional cortical surface area and thickness in 39,898 adults and 9136 children. We uncovered 440 genome-wide significant loci in the discovery cohort and 800 from a post hoc combined meta-analysis. Loci in adulthood were largely captured in childhood, showing signatures of negative selection, and were linked to early neurodevelopment and pathways associated with neuropsychiatric risk. Opposing gradations of decreased surface area and increased thickness were associated with common inversion polymorphisms. Inferior frontal regions, encompassing Broca's area, which is important for speech, were enriched for human-specific genomic elements. Thus, a mixed genetic landscape of conserved and human-specific features is concordant with brain hierarchy and morphogenetic gradients."

https://openalex.org/W4210354793,"Although much is known about plant traits that function in nonhost resistance against pathogens, little is known about nonhost resistance against herbivores, despite its agricultural importance. Empoasca leafhoppers, serious agricultural pests, identify host plants by eavesdropping on unknown outputs of jasmonate (JA)-mediated signaling. Forward- and reverse-genetics lines of a native tobacco plant were screened in native habitats with native herbivores using high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic tools to reveal an Empoasca-elicited JA-JAZi module. This module induces an uncharacterized caffeoylputrescine-green leaf volatile compound, catalyzed by a polyphenol oxidase in a Michael addition reaction, which we reconstitute in vitro; engineer in crop plants, where it requires a berberine bridge enzyme-like 2 (BBL2) for its synthesis; and show that it confers resistance to leafhoppers. Natural history-guided forward genetics reveals a conserved nonhost resistance mechanism useful for crop protection."

https://openalex.org/W4210701631,"By catalysing the microbial formation of methane, methyl-coenzyme M reductase has a central role in the global levels of this greenhouse gas1,2. The activity of methyl-coenzyme M reductase is profoundly affected by several unique post-translational modifications3-6, such as a unique C-methylation reaction catalysed by methanogenesis marker protein 10 (Mmp10), a radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) enzyme7,8. Here we report the spectroscopic investigation and atomic resolution structure of Mmp10 from Methanosarcina acetivorans, a unique B12 (cobalamin)-dependent radical SAM enzyme9. The structure of Mmp10 reveals a unique enzyme architecture with four metallic centres and critical structural features involved in the control of catalysis. In addition, the structure of the enzyme-substrate complex offers a glimpse into a B12-dependent radical SAM enzyme in a precatalytic state. By combining electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, structural biology and biochemistry, our study illuminates the mechanism by which the emerging superfamily of B12-dependent radical SAM enzymes catalyse chemically challenging alkylation reactions and identifies distinctive active site rearrangements to provide a structural rationale for the dual use of the SAM cofactor for radical and nucleophilic chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W4225562530,"During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was great enthusiasm for the use of azithromycin with or without hydroxychloroquine.We analyzed azithromycin consumption in Croatia in 2020 and compared this to the period 2017-2019.Azithromycin consumption was evaluated using the IQVIA Adriatic d.o.o. database which collects data on azithromycin distribution from wholesale pharmacies to hospital and non-hospital pharmacies in Croatia. We analyzed data for the period from January 2017 to December 2020. Azithromycin distribution was measured as days of therapy (DOT) and reported as per 1000 inhabitants or per 1000 inhabitant-days.In the period 2017-2020, total azithromycin DOT in Croatia increased in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (1.76, 1.91, 1.91 and 2.01/1000 inhabitant-days, respectively). Non-hospital pharmacies received 2.18 times and hospital pharmacies 4.39 times more DOT units/1000 inhabitants of azithromycin in March 2020 compared to the average distribution rate in March 2017-2019. During the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic (November and December 2020) azithromycin distribution increased considerably in hospital (3.62 and 3.19 times, respectively) and non-hospital pharmacies (1.93 and 1.84 times, respectively) compared to the average consumption in the same months in 2017-2019.Our data showed increased azithromycin distribution in the period 2017-2020 which indicates azithromycin overuse. Preliminary information on COVID-19 treatments with a desire to offer and try what is available even in the absence of strong scientific evidence may have influenced practices of antimicrobial prescriptions."
https://openalex.org/W4210717981,"With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, universities immediately responded to protect students' lives by implementing e-learning in order to stop the spread of the communicable disease within the academic population. This study aimed to describe iranian nursing students' experiences of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.The current study used a qualitative descriptive study. Ten nursing undergraduate students from a single Iranian university identified using purposive sampling methods. Face-to-face semi-structured interview conducted from May to July 2021 and analyzed through thematic analysis. Lincoln and Goba criteria were used to obtain data validity and reliability.Four themes emerged including""novelty of e-learning"",""advantages of e-learning"", ""disadvantages of e-learning""and""passage of time and the desire to return to face education"". Participants evaluated e-learning as a novel method without proper infrastructure, it was initially confusing but became the new normal as their knowledge of the way to use it improved. Advantages included self-centered flexible learning and reduction in their concerns experienced with face-to-face learning. Disadvantages including changing the way they interact with teachers, decreasing interactions with classmates, problems with education files, superficial learning, hardware problems, family members' perceptions of the student role, interference of home affairs with e-learning, cheating on exams and assignments and being far away from the clinical context.The findings revealed that e-learning has been introduced as a new method for the current research participants and despite the perceived benefits, these students believed that e-learning could supplement face education but not replace it."
https://openalex.org/W4226136550,"We tested whether social signal processing in more traditional, head-restrained contexts is representative of the putative natural analog—social communication—by comparing responses to vocalizations within individual neurons in marmoset prefrontal cortex (PFC) across a series of behavioral contexts ranging from traditional to naturalistic. Although vocalization-responsive neurons were evident in all contexts, cross-context consistency was notably limited. A response to these social signals when subjects were head-restrained was not predictive of a comparable neural response to the identical vocalizations during natural communication. This pattern was evident both within individual neurons and at a population level, as PFC activity could be reliably decoded for the behavioral context in which vocalizations were heard. These results suggest that neural representations of social signals in primate PFC are not static but highly flexible and likely reflect how nuances of the dynamic behavioral contexts affect the perception of these signals and what they communicate."
https://openalex.org/W4210685166,"Distortions of the observed cosmic microwave background imprinted by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect toward massive galaxy clusters due to inverse Compton scattering of microwave photons by high-energy electrons provide a direct measurement of the microwave background temperature at redshifts from 0 to 1. Some additional background temperature estimates exist at redshifts from 1.8 to 3.3 based on molecular and atomic line excitation temperatures in quasar absorption line systems, but are model dependent. To date, no deviations from the expected (1+z) scaling behavior of the microwave background temperature have been seen, but the measurements have not extended deeply into the matter-dominated era of the universe at redshifts z>3.3. Here we report the detection of sub-millimeter line absorption from the water molecule against the cosmic microwave background at z=6.34 in a massive starburst galaxy, corresponding to a lookback time of 12.8 Gyr. Radiative pumping of the upper level of the ground-state ortho-H2O(110-101) line due to starburst activity in the dusty galaxy HFLS3 results in a cooling to below the redshifted microwave background temperature, after the transition is initially excited by the microwave background. The strength of this effect implies a microwave background temperature of 16.4-30.2 K (1-sigma range) at z=6.34, which is consistent with a background temperature increase with redshift as expected from the standard CDM cosmology."
https://openalex.org/W4210737279,"Electrically charged particles can be created by the decay of strong enough electric fields, a phenomenon known as the Schwinger mechanism1. By electromagnetic duality, a sufficiently strong magnetic field would similarly produce magnetic monopoles, if they exist2. Magnetic monopoles are hypothetical fundamental particles that are predicted by several theories beyond the standard model3-7 but have never been experimentally detected. Searching for the existence of magnetic monopoles via the Schwinger mechanism has not yet been attempted, but it is advantageous, owing to the possibility of calculating its rate through semi-classical techniques without perturbation theory, as well as that the production of the magnetic monopoles should be enhanced by their finite size8,9 and strong coupling to photons2,10. Here we present a search for magnetic monopole production by the Schwinger mechanism in Pb-Pb heavy ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, producing the strongest known magnetic fields in the current Universe11. It was conducted by the MoEDAL experiment, whose trapping detectors were exposed to 0.235 per nanobarn, or approximately 1.8 × 109, of Pb-Pb collisions with 5.02-teraelectronvolt center-of-mass energy per collision in November 2018. A superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer scanned the trapping detectors of MoEDAL for the presence of magnetic charge, which would induce a persistent current in the SQUID. Magnetic monopoles with integer Dirac charges of 1, 2 and 3 and masses up to 75 gigaelectronvolts per speed of light squared were excluded by the analysis at the 95% confidence level. This provides a lower mass limit for finite-size magnetic monopoles from a collider search and greatly extends previous mass bounds."
https://openalex.org/W4210538498,"Isoprene is emitted mainly by terrestrial vegetation and is the dominant volatile organic compound (VOC) in Earth's atmosphere. It plays key roles in determining the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere and the formation of organic aerosol. Daytime infrared satellite observations of isoprene reported here broadly agree with emission inventories, but we found substantial differences in the locations and magnitudes of isoprene hotspots, consistent with a recent study. The corresponding nighttime infrared observations reveal unexpected hotspots over tropical South America, the Congo basin, and Southeast Asia. We used an atmospheric chemistry model to link these nighttime isoprene measurements to low-NOx regions with high biogenic VOC emissions; at sunrise the remaining isoprene can lead to the production of epoxydiols and subsequently to the widespread seasonal production of organic aerosol in the tropical upper troposphere."
https://openalex.org/W4210668629,"Interactions in many-body physical systems, from condensed matter to high-energy physics, lead to the emergence of exotic particles. Examples are mesons in quantum chromodynamics and composite fermions in fractional quantum Hall systems, which arise from the dynamical coupling between matter and gauge fields1,2. The challenge of understanding the complexity of matter-gauge interaction can be aided by quantum simulations, for which ultracold atoms offer a versatile platform via the creation of artificial gauge fields. An important step towards simulating the physics of exotic emergent particles is the synthesis of artificial gauge fields whose state depends dynamically on the presence of matter. Here we demonstrate deterministic formation of domain walls in a stable Bose-Einstein condensate with a gauge field that is determined by the atomic density. The density-dependent gauge field is created by simultaneous modulations of an optical lattice potential and interatomic interactions, and results in domains of atoms condensed into two different momenta. Modelling the domain walls as elementary excitations, we find that the domain walls respond to synthetic electric field with a charge-to-mass ratio larger than and opposite to that of the bare atoms. Our work offers promising prospects to simulate the dynamics and interactions of previously undescribed excitations in quantum systems with dynamical gauge fields."

Studies on the chloroplast genomes of them are favorable for understanding the diversity and phylogeny of Zygophyllaceae. Here, we sequenced and assembled the whole chloroplast genomes of T. mongolica, Z. xanthoxylon, and Z. fabago, and performed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis. The total size, structure, gene content and orders of these three chloroplast genomes were similar, and the three chloroplast genomes exhibited a typical quadripartite structure with a large single-copy region (LSC; 79,696-80,291 bp), a small single-copy region (SSC; 16,462-17,162 bp), and two inverted repeats (IRs; 4,288-4,413 bp). A total of 107 unique genes were identified from the three chloroplast genomes, including 70 protein-coding genes, 33 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. Compared with other angiosperms, the three chloroplast genomes were significantly reduced in overall length due to an unusual 16-24 kb shrinkage of IR regions and loss of the 11 genes which encoded subunits of NADH dehydrogenase. Genome-wide comparisons revealed similarities and variations between the three species and others. Phylogenetic analysis based on the three chloroplast genomes supported the opinion that Zygophyllaceae belonged to Zygophyllales in Fabids, and Z. xanthoxylon and Z. fabago belonged to Zygophyllum. The genome-wide comparisons revealed the similarity and variations between the chloroplast genomes of the three Zygophylloideae species and other plant species. This study provides a valuable molecular biology evidence for further studies of phylogenetic status of Zygophyllaceae."
https://openalex.org/W4221136474,"Deregulation of transcription is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that drives oncogenic expression programs and presents opportunities for therapeutic targeting. By integrating comprehensive pan-cancer enhancer landscapes with genetic dependency mapping, we find that AML-enriched enhancers encode for more selective tumor dependencies. We hypothesized that this approach could identify actionable dependencies downstream of oncogenic driver events and discovered a MYB-regulated AML-enriched enhancer regulating SEPHS2, a key component of the selenoprotein production pathway. Using a combination of patient samples and mouse models, we show that this enhancer upregulates SEPHS2, promoting selenoprotein production and antioxidant function required for AML survival. SEPHS2 and other selenoprotein pathway genes are required for AML growth in vitro. SEPHS2 knockout and selenium dietary restriction significantly delay leukemogenesis in vivo with little effect on normal hematopoiesis. These data validate the utility of enhancer mapping in target identification and suggest that selenoprotein production is an actionable target in AML."
https://openalex.org/W4226240479,"Understanding long-term trends in marine ecosystems requires accurate and repeatable counts of fishes and other aquatic organisms on spatial and temporal scales that are difficult or impossible to achieve with diver-based surveys. Long-term, spatially distributed cameras, like those used in terrestrial camera trapping, have not been successfully applied in marine systems due to limitations of the aquatic environment. Here, we develop methodology for a system of low-cost, long-term camera traps (Dispersed Environment Aquatic Cameras), deployable over large spatial scales in remote marine environments. We use machine learning to classify the large volume of images collected by the cameras. We present a case study of these combined techniques' use by addressing fish movement and feeding behavior related to halos, a well-documented benthic pattern in shallow tropical reefscapes. Cameras proved able to function continuously underwater at deployed depths (up to 7 m, with later versions deployed to 40 m) with no maintenance or monitoring for over five months and collected a total of over 100,000 images in time-lapse mode (by 15 minutes) during daylight hours. Our ResNet-50-based deep learning model achieved 92.5% overall accuracy in sorting images with and without fishes, and diver surveys revealed that the camera images accurately represented local fish communities. The cameras and machine learning classification represent the first successful method for broad-scale underwater camera trap deployment, and our case study demonstrates the cameras' potential for addressing questions of marine animal behavior, distributions, and large-scale spatial patterns."

This study aims to develop the application of a quality function deployment approach to increase the resilience of the food supply chain by understanding customer needs and logistical risks in the food supply chain. In-depth studies with empirical analysis were conducted to determine the importance of customer needs, food supply chain risks, and actions to improve supply chain resilience of SMEs in the agri-food industry. The result shows that the top three customer needs are ""attractive, bright color"", ""firm texture"" and ""fresh smell"". The top three risks in the agri-food supply chain are ""improper storage,"" ""Harvest Failure"" and ""Human Resource Risks"" and the top three resilience actions are ""continuous training,"" ""preventive maintenance,"" and ""supply chain forecasting."" The implications of this study are to propose an idea that broadens the perspective of supply chain resilience in the agri-food industry by incorporating the needs of customers in considering how to mitigate the existing risks to the satisfaction of customers, and it also highlights the relatively low skill and coordination of the workforce in agri-food supply chains."

Care-seeking behavior was assessed with regard to caregivers seeking care for children under-five in the two weeks prior to each survey. We compared the percentages of healthcare-seeking behavior change and identify factors associated with healthcare-seeking using a modified Poisson regression model with generalized estimating equations.In 2008, a total of 1208 children with fever were recorded, compared with 2823 children in 2013, 1633 in 2016, and 1464 in 2019. Care-seeking for children with fever was lowest in 2008 (51%; 95% CI (46.4-55.5)) than in 2013 (71.5%; 95% CI (68.4-74.5)), 2016 (70.3%; 95% CI (66.6-73.8)), and 2019 (74.6%; 95% CI (71.6-77.3)) (p < 0.001). Care-seeking in 2013, 2016 and 2019 was at least 1.4 time higher than in 2008 (p < 0.001) after adjusting for mother's age, wealth, religion, education level, household head and the child's age. Care-seeking was lowest for children older than 12 months, mothers older than 35 years, children living in the poorest households, and in the northern region. A trend was observed for the sex of the household head. The level of care-seeking was lowest when the household head was a man.The increase in healthcare-seeking for children under-five with fever followed the introduction of the FHCI in Sierra Leone. Care-seeking for fever varied by the child's age, caregiver's age, household wealth, the sex of the household head and region. Maintaining the FHCI with adequate strategies to address other barriers beyond financial ones is essential to reduce disparities between age groups, regions and, households."
https://openalex.org/W4210498707,"Transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) is a prognostic marker of poor outcome in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Glembatumumab Vedotin, an antibody drug conjugate targeting GPNMB, exhibits variable efficacy against GPNMB-positive metastatic TNBC as a single agent. We show that GPNMB levels increase in response to standard-of-care and experimental therapies for multiple breast cancer subtypes. While these therapeutic stressors induce GPNMB expression through differential engagement of the MiTF family of transcription factors, not all are capable of increasing GPNMB cell-surface localization required for Glembatumumab Vedotin inhibition. Using a FACS-based genetic screen, we discovered that suppression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) concomitantly increases GPNMB expression and cell-surface localization. Mechanistically, HSP90 inhibition resulted in lysosomal dispersion towards the cell periphery and fusion with the plasma membrane, which delivers GPNMB to the cell surface. Finally, treatment with HSP90 inhibitors sensitizes breast cancers to Glembatumumab Vedotin in vivo, suggesting that combination of HSP90 inhibitors and Glembatumumab Vedotin may be a viable treatment strategy for patients with metastatic TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W4225553061,"Pre-pandemic influenza H5N1 vaccine has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires high antigen amounts and two immunizations to induce protective immunity. Incorporation of vaccine adjuvants is promising to stretch vaccine doses during pandemic outbreaks. This study presents a physical radiofrequency (RF) adjuvant (RFA) to conveniently and effectively increase the immunogenicity and efficacy of H5N1 vaccine without modification of vaccine preparation. Physical RFA is based on a brief RF treatment of the skin to induce thermal stress to enhance intradermal vaccine-induced immune responses with minimal local or systemic adverse reactions. We found that physical RFA could significantly increase H5N1 vaccine-induced hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers in murine models. Intradermal H5N1 vaccine in the presence of RFA but not vaccine alone significantly lowered lung viral titers, reduced body weight loss, and improved survival rates after lethal viral challenges. The improved protection in the presence of RFA was correlated with enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses to H5N1 vaccination in both male and female mice, indicating no gender difference of RFA effects in murine models. Our data support further development of the physical RFA to conveniently enhance the efficacy of H5N1 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W4210715054,"Estimating population density and population dynamics is essential for understanding primate ecology and relies on robust methods. While distance sampling theory provides a robust framework for estimating animal abundance, implementing a constrained, non-systematic transect design could bias density estimates. Here, we assessed potential bias associated with line distance sampling surveys along roads based on a case study with olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania). This was achieved by comparing density estimates of olive baboons derived from road transect surveys with density estimates derived from estimating the maximum number of social groups (via sleeping site counts) and multiplying this metric with the estimated average size of social groups. From 2011 to 2019, we counted olive baboons along road transects, estimated survey-specific densities in a distance sampling framework, and assessed temporal population trends. Based on the fitted half-normal detection function, the mean density was 132.5 baboons km-2 (95% CI: 110.4-159.2), however, detection models did not fit well due to heaping of sightings on and near the transects. Density estimates were associated with relatively wide confidence intervals that were mostly caused by encounter rate variance. Based on a generalized additive model, baboon densities were greater during the rainy seasons compared to the dry seasons but did not show marked annual trends. Compared to estimates derived from the alternative method (sleeping site survey), distance sampling along road transects overestimated the abundance of baboons more than threefold. Possibly, this overestimation was caused by the preferred use of roads by baboons. While being a frequently used technique (due to its relative ease of implementation compared to spatially randomized survey techniques), inferring population density of baboons (and possibly other species) based on road transects should be treated with caution. Beyond these methodological concerns and considering only the most conservative estimates, baboon densities in LMNP are among the highest across their geographic distribution range."
https://openalex.org/W4210248860,"The presence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs in the periphery and brain represents a major obstacle to curing HIV-1 infection. As an essential protein for HIV-1 viral replication, HIV-1 Tat, mostly intracellular, has been implicated in latent HIV-1 infection. From HIV-1 infected cells, HIV-1 Tat is actively secreted and bystander cells uptake the released Tat whereupon it is endocytosed and internalized into endolysosomes. However, to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter and increase HIV-1 replication, HIV-1 Tat must first escape from the endolysosomes and then enter the nucleus. Here, we tested the hypothesis that HIV-1 Tat can accumulate in endolysosomes and contribute to the activation of latent HIV-1 in astrocytes. Using U87MG astrocytoma cells expressing HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase and primary human astrocytes we found that exogenous HIV-1 Tat enters endolysosomes, resides in endolysosomes for extended periods of time, and induces endolysosome de-acidification as well as enlargement. The weak base chloroquine promoted the release of HIV-1 Tat from endolysosomes and induced HIV-1 LTR transactivation. Similar results were observed by activating endolysosome Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR7/8. Conversely, pharmacological block of TLRs and knocking down expression levels of TLR3 and TLR7, but not TLR8, prevented endolysosome leakage and attenuated HIV-1 Tat-mediated HIV-1 LTR transactivation. Our findings suggest that HIV-1 Tat accumulation in endolysosomes may play an important role in controlling HIV-1 transactivation."

Our research group (two doctors, one graphic designer and one sociologist) have led a qualitative study based on Focus Groups. A semi-structured guide and examples of VA were used to stimulate discussions. Participants were healthcare professionals (HP) working in ambulatory practice in Geneva and French-speaking outpatients. After inductive thematic analysis, the coding process was analyzed and modified to eventually reach consensus. Six focus groups gathered twenty-one HP and fifteen patients. Our study underlines the variety of purposes of use of VA and the different contexts of use allowing the distinction between “stand-alone” VA used out of consultation by patients alone and “interactive” VA used during a consultation enriched by the interaction between HP and patients. HP described that VA can take the form of useful tools for education and communication during consultation. They have questioned the quality of available VA and complained about restricted access to them. Patients expressed concern about the impact of VA on the interaction with HP. Participants agreed on the beneficial role of VA to supplement verbal explanation and text. Our study emphasizes the need to classify available VA, guarantee their quality, facilitate their access and deliver pertinent instructions for use."
https://openalex.org/W4210691900,"Education is a fundamental human right. Yet there remain gaps in our understanding of undocumented children in Malaysia and their vulnerabilities in education access. This study aims to describe and contextualise undocumented children in Malaysia and their access to education. We conducted a desk review and in-depth interviews with 33 key stakeholders from June 2020 to March 2021. Framework analysis was conducted. Salient themes were geographical location and legal identity in terms of citizenship and migration status. We found that the lack of legal identity and non-recognition by the State was the root cause of vulnerability, experienced uniformly by undocumented populations in Malaysia. Only undocumented children with Malaysian parents or guardians can enter public schools under the Malaysian government's 'Zero Reject Policy'. Most undocumented and non-citizen children must rely on informal education provided by alternative or community learning centres that typically lack standardised curricula, resources, and accreditation for education progression beyond primary levels. Nevertheless, as non-citizen groups are diverse, certain groups experience more privilege, while others are more disadvantaged in terms of the quality of informal education and the highest level of education accessible. In Peninsular Malaysia, a very small proportion of refugees and asylum-seekers may additionally access tertiary education on scholarships. In Sabah, children of Indonesian migrant workers have access to learning centres with academic accreditation supported by employers in plantations and the Indonesian Consulate, whereas Filipino migrants who were initially recognised as refugees are now receiving little government or embassy support. Stateless Rohingya refugees in Peninsular Malaysia and Bajau Laut children at Sabah are arguably the most marginalised and have the poorest educational opportunities at basic literacy and numeracy levels, despite the latter receiving minimal governmental education support. Implementing a rights-based approach towards education would mean allowing all children equal opportunity to access and thrive in high-quality schools."
https://openalex.org/W4210346990,"Background The current study aimed to determine the association between timing and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and outcomes in real-world patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer. Methods In this multi-center cohort study patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer who were diagnosed from 2007–2017 and underwent complete resection in the province of Saskatchewan were examined. Cox proportional multivariate analyses were performed for correlation with recurrence and survival. Results Of 168 patients, 71 eligible patients with median age of 69 years and M:F of 37:34 were identified. Median time to the start of adjuvant therapy from surgery was 73 days. Of all patients, 49 (69%) patients completed adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 (31%) required early treatment discontinuation. Median recurrence-free survival of patients who completed treatment was 22 months (95%CI:15.8–28.2) vs. 9 months (3.3–14.7) if treatment was discontinued early (P&lt;0.001). Median overall survival of those who completed treatment was 33 (17.5–48.5) vs. 16 months (17.5–48.5) with early treatment discontinuation (P&lt;0.001). In the multivariate analysis, treatment discontinuation was significantly correlated with recurrent disease, hazard ratio (HR), 2.57 (1.41–4.68), P = 0.002 and inferior survival, HR, 2.55 (1.39–4.68), P = 0.003. No correlation between treatment timing and survival was noted. Conclusions Early discontinuation but not the timing of adjuvant chemotherapy correlates with inferior outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4210626462,"This study aimed to determine short- and long-term physical and psychosocial impact of Coxiella burnetii infection in three distinct entities: Q-fever fatigue syndrome (QFS), chronic Q-fever, and patients with past acute Q-fever without QFS or chronic Q-fever.Integrative data analysis was performed, combining original data from eight studies measuring quality of life (QoL), fatigue, physical and social functioning with identical validated questionnaires, from three months to eight years after onset infection. Linear trends in each outcome were compared between Q-fever groups using multilevel linear regression analyses to account for repeated measures within patients.Data included 3947 observations of 2313 individual patients (228 QFS, 135 chronic Q-fever and 1950 patients with past acute Q-fever). In the first years following infection, physical and psychosocial impact was highest among QFS patients, and remained high without significant improvements over time. In chronic Q-fever patients, QoL and physical functioning worsened significantly over time. Levels of fatigue and social participation in patients with past acute Q-fever improved significantly over time.The impact differs greatly between the three Q-fever groups. It is important that physicians are aware of these differences, in order to provide relevant care for each patient group."
https://openalex.org/W4210647599,"Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedure, well established as a diagnostic modality of first choice for diagnosis and staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The therapeutic decisions for advanced NSCLC require comprehensive profiling of actionable mutations, which is currently considered to be an essential part of the diagnostic process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of EBUS-TBNA cytology specimen for histological subtyping, molecular profiling of NSCLC by massive parallel sequencing (MPS), as well as for PD-L1 analysis. A retrospective review of 806 EBUS bronchoscopies was performed, resulting in a cohort of 132 consecutive patients with EBUS-TBNA specimens showing NSCLC cells in lymph nodes. Data on patient demographics, radiology features of the suspected tumor and mediastinal engagement, lymph nodes sampled, the histopathological subtype of NSCLC, and performed molecular analysis were collected. The EBUS-TBNA specimen proved sufficient for subtyping NSCLC in 83% and analysis of treatment predictive biomarkers in 77% (MPS in 53%). The adequacy of the EBUS-TBNA specimen was 69% for EGFR gene mutation analysis, 49% for analysis of ALK rearrangement, 36% for ROS1 rearrangement, and 33% for analysis of PD-L1. The findings of our study confirm that EBUS-TBNA cytology aspirate is appropriate for diagnosis and subtyping of NSCLC and largely also for treatment predictive molecular testing, although more data is needed on the utility of EBUS cytology specimen for MPS and PD-L1 analysis."

Ultrasound imaging studies of the thyroid gland report varied prevalence of asymptomatic thyroid nodules (ATN), ranging from 20 to 67%. This study estimated the prevalence, characterized and determined factors associated with ATN in selected communities in the Assin North Municipality, Central Region, Ghana.The study was a cross-sectional design, involving 320 participants from six (6) communities in the Assin North District of the Central Region of Ghana. Socio-demographic data and data from ultrasound examination of the thyroid gland were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical techniques.The prevalence of ATN was 11.3% among 320 participants with the mean age of 56.53(±16.5) years. ATNs were common in the left lobe (69%) and predominantly solitary (64%). ATNs increased with age and body mass index (BMI). Those aged 60 years and above had significantly higher odds (OR = 24.40, 95% CI = 2.59-229.86) of having ATNs, likewise overweigh (OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 1.12-25.20) and obese (OR = 12.51, 95% CI = 1.47-106.58) individuals.The prevalence of ATN in our study population was relatively low, and more predictable among those 60 years or older, those in unhealthy BMI categories. There is the need for the reinforcement and intensification of educational campaigns on the consumption of iodized dietary salt as well as the consumption of foods rich in iodine content, particularly among older individuals."

Our aim was to analyze the influence of national lockdown during the first wave and the regional restrictions during the second wave on the rate of visits to the ED and urgent hand surgeries in Finland.Material for this retrospective study was gathered from three Finnish hospitals All ED visits and urgent or emergency surgeries from January 2017 to December 2020 were included. Incidences per 100 000 persons with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and compared by incidence rate ratios (IRR).The incidence of hand injury was lower after the beginning of the lockdown in March 2020 (IRR 0.70 CI 0.63-0.78). After lockdown ended in May, the monthly incidences of ED visits returned to the reference level. During the lockdown, the incidence of fractures and dislocations was 42% lower in March (IRR 0.58 CI 0.50-0.68) and 33% lower in April 2020 (IRR 0.67 CI 0.57-0.80). The incidence of fracture repair surgeries was 43% lower in March 2020 (IRR 0.57 CI 0.35-0.93) and 41% lower in July 2020 (IRR 0.59 CI 0.36-0.98).

After the lockdown, the incidences returned to reference level and were unaffected by regional restrictions during the second wave of pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4210796673,"Car sharing has become a new mode of transport during the past two decades in the world. Its rapid growth in China has attracted a wide range of users and posed some problems. The main focus is on service efficiency and user satisfaction. To explore possible service enhancement and management intervention, this study aims at capturing the user characteristics according to different user types and scrutinizing their satisfaction with station-based one-way car sharing service. The study firstly illustrates descriptive statistics of user profile. This is followed by a study of user satisfaction influenced by user rates on staffs, the efficiency of rental process, vehicle situation, the use of credit card and their familiarity towards rental station. Furthermore, by clustering users according to the total travel time and distance during one rent, two different types of users are identified and defined as User Group A (UGA) and User Group B (UGB). To examine how fully do users utilize the shared cars, ANOVA was conducted implying family car ownership, total travel distance and main travel purpose have strong impact on total rental time for UGB, while for UGA, travel purpose and age have strong impact. Finally, ordinal logistic regression was introduced to find that for UGB, ""shopping"" is the main travel purpose with longer rental time, whereas for UGA, ""out for business"", ""shopping"", ""visit friends"" or ""pick up others"" are the main travel purposes with longer total travel time. Based on the findings, advices for operators on how to improve service quality and suggestions for government management strategy are discussed, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W4210327326,"Nest architecture plays a fundamental role in the adaptation of ants to their habitat, favoring the action of economically important species. Ectatomma ruidum sp. 2 (ruidum species complex) is a biological control agent in Neotropical agroecosystems, exhibiting high bioturbation impact due to high nest densities. The architecture and composition of 152 nests were studied in two Andean populations of southwestern Colombia, 24 of them being cast using the paraffin wax technique. Nest entrance was a single, circular, 4 mm hole at ground level, without any special external structure, connected to a single vertical tunnel communicating with successive half ellipsoidal chambers. Nests were extremely shallow (depth range: 28.7-35.4 cm), with an average of six chambers and an overall volume of 92.2 cm3 per nest. The deeper the chamber, the smaller its volume. Nest building was independent of plants or roots, and no surface or underground physical connections were found between neighboring nests. Few nests possessed a queen, and neither ergatoids nor microgynes were recorded. Despite significant interactions between localities and the number of both males and workers, queen presence had an overall highly positive effect on the number of workers and larvae and a negative one on the number of gynes. Overall, the studied Colombian populations of E. ruidum sp. 2 retained the simple nest structure described for other species of this species complex and for colonies of the same species from other geographical areas, though they constrasted in their extreme shallowness. Our data suggest that E. ruidum sp. 2, at the local level, does not follow the usual monodomic pattern of this species with facultative polygyny but, rather, has a polydomic pattern with monogyny, perhaps related to the extreme shallowness of the nests due to soil structure, which could significantly enhance the queen's reproductive inhibition previously reported for this species."
https://openalex.org/W4210425489,"Current methods for identification of oxygenator clotting during prolonged extracorporeal life support include visual inspection, evaluation of oxygenator resistance and oxygen exchange performance, and assessment of clotting-related laboratory parameters. However, these observations do not provide a quantitative assessment of oxygenator clot formation. By measuring changes in the dynamic oxygenator blood volume this study aimed to evaluate the relation to oxygenator resistance and oxygen transfer performance. Sixty-seven oxygenators were studied during adult extracorporeal life support. Oxygenator blood volume, oxygenator resistance, and oxygen transfer efficiency were monitored. Oxygenator blood volume decreased with increasing runtime (r = -0.462; p &lt;0.001). There was a statistically significant, fair negative correlation between oxygenator blood volume and oxygenator resistance (r = -0.476; p&lt;0.001) in all oxygenators, which became stronger analyzing only exchanged oxygenators (r = -0.680; p&lt;0.001) and oxygenators with an oxygenator blood volume &lt;187 mL (r = 0.831; p&lt;0.001). No relevant correlation between oxygenator blood volume and O 2 transfer was found. Oxygenator blood volume declined over time and was clearly associated with an increasing oxygenator resistance during prolonged extracorporeal life support, though O 2 transfer was less affected."
