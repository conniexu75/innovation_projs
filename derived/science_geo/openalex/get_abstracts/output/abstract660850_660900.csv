Here we use the potent channelrhodopsin ChRmine to achieve transcranial photoactivation of defined neural circuits, including midbrain and brainstem structures, at unprecedented depths of up to 7 mm with millisecond precision. Using systemic viral delivery of ChRmine, we demonstrate behavioral modulation without surgery, enabling implant-free deep brain optogenetics."
https://openalex.org/W3090222939,"Abstract Wild and weedy relatives of domesticated crops harbor genetic variants that can advance agricultural biotechnology. Here we provide a genome resource for the wild plant green millet ( Setaria viridis ), a model species for studies of C 4 grasses, and use the resource to probe domestication genes in the close crop relative foxtail millet ( Setaria italica ). We produced a platinum-quality genome assembly of S. viridis and de novo assemblies for 598 wild accessions and exploited these assemblies to identify loci underlying three traits: response to climate, a ‘loss of shattering’ trait that permits mechanical harvest and leaf angle, a predictor of yield in many grass crops. With CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing, we validated Less Shattering1 ( SvLes1 ) as a gene whose product controls seed shattering. In S. italica , this gene was rendered nonfunctional by a retrotransposon insertion in the domesticated loss-of-shattering allele SiLes1-TE (transposable element). This resource will enhance the utility of S. viridis for dissection of complex traits and biotechnological improvement of panicoid crops."

https://openalex.org/W3090355867,"Preclinical modeling suggests that intermittent BRAF inhibitor therapy may delay acquired resistance when blocking oncogenic BRAFV600 in melanoma1,2. We conducted S1320, a randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT02196181) evaluating whether intermittent dosing of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib improves progression-free survival in patients with metastatic and unresectable BRAFV600 melanoma. Patients were enrolled at 68 academic and community sites nationally. All patients received continuous dabrafenib and trametinib during an 8-week lead-in period, after which patients with non-progressing tumors were randomized to either continuous or intermittent dosing of both drugs on a 3-week-off, 5-week-on schedule. The trial has completed accrual and 206 patients with similar baseline characteristics were randomized 1:1 to the two study arms (105 to continuous dosing, 101 to intermittent dosing). Continuous dosing yielded a statistically significant improvement in post-randomization progression-free survival compared with intermittent dosing (median 9.0 months versus 5.5 months, P = 0.064, pre-specified two-sided α = 0.2). Therefore, contrary to the initial hypothesis, intermittent dosing did not improve progression-free survival in patients. There were no differences in the secondary outcomes, including overall survival and the overall incidence of treatment-associated toxicity, between the two groups."

https://openalex.org/W3092207896,"The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan has significantly impacted the economy and society globally. Countries are in a strict state of prevention and control of this pandemic. In this study, the development trend analysis of the cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, and cumulative cured cases was conducted based on data from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China from January 23, 2020 to April 6, 2020 using an Elman neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machine (SVM). A SVM with fuzzy granulation was used to predict the growth range of confirmed new cases, new deaths, and new cured cases. The experimental results showed that the Elman neural network and SVM used in this study can predict the development trend of cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and cured cases, whereas LSTM is more suitable for the prediction of the cumulative confirmed cases. The SVM with fuzzy granulation can successfully predict the growth range of confirmed new cases and new cured cases, although the average predicted values are slightly large. Currently, the United States is the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also used data modeling from the United States to further verify the validity of the proposed models."

https://openalex.org/W3042582467,"About 50% of individuals infected with the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) suffer from intestinal infection as well as respiratory infection. They shed virus in their stool. Municipal sewage systems carry the virus and its genetic remnants. These viral traces can be detected in the sewage entering a wastewater treatment plant (WTP). Such virus signals indicate community infections but not locations of the infection within the community. In this paper, we frame and formulate the problem in a way that leads to algorithmic procedures homing in on locations and/or neighborhoods within the community that are most likely to have infections. Our data source is wastewater sampled and real-time tested from selected manholes. Our algorithms dynamically and adaptively develop a sequence of manholes to sample and test. The algorithms are often finished after 5 to 10 manhole samples, meaning that—in the field—the procedure can be carried out within one day. The goal is to provide timely information that will support faster more productive human testing for viral infection and thus reduce community disease spread. Leveraging the tree graph structure of the sewage system, we develop two algorithms, the first designed for a community that is certified at a given time to have zero infections and the second for a community known to have many infections. For the first, we assume that wastewater at the WTP has just revealed traces of SARS-CoV-2, indicating existence of a “Patient Zero” in the community. This first algorithm identifies the city block in which the infected person resides. For the second, we home in on a most infected neighborhood of the community, where a neighborhood is usually several city blocks. We present extensive computational results, some applied to a small New England city."
https://openalex.org/W3089835130,"Aim This study explored the effect of a moderate (90 g/d) low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) in type 2 diabetes patients over 18 months. Methods Ninety-two poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients aged 20–80 years with HbA1c ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) in the previous three months were randomly assigned to a 90 g/d LCD r traditional diabetic diet (TDD). The primary outcomes were glycaemic control status and change in medication effect score (MES). The secondary outcomes were lipid profiles, small, dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL), serum creatinine, microalbuminuria and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Results A total of 85 (92.4%) patients completed 18 months of the trial. At the end of the study, the LCD and TDD group consumed 88.0±29.9 g and 151.1±29.8 g of carbohydrates, respectively (p < 0.05). The 18-month mean change from baseline was statistically significant for the HbA1c (-1.6±0.3 vs. -1.0±0.3%), 2-h glucose (-94.4±20.8 vs. -18.7±25.7 mg/dl), MES (-0.42±0.32 vs. -0.05±0.24), weight (-2.8±1.8 vs. -0.7±0.7 kg), waist circumference (-5.7±2.7 vs. -1.9±1.4 cm), hip circumference (-6.1±1.8 vs. -2.9±1.7 cm) and blood pressure (-8.3±4.6/-5.0±3 vs. 1.6±0.5/2.5±1.6 mmHg) between the LCD and TDD groups (p<0.05). The 18-month mean change from baseline was not significantly different in lipid profiles, sdLDL, serum creatinine, microalbuminuria, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and carotid IMT between the groups. Conclusions A moderate (90 g/d) LCD showed better glycaemic control with decreasing MES, lowering blood pressure, decreasing weight, waist and hip circumference without adverse effects on lipid profiles, sdLDL, serum creatinine, microalbuminuria, ALT and carotid IMT than TDD for type 2 diabetic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3089434025,"Purpose To assess the value of the PI-RADS 2.1 scoring system in the detection of prostate cancer on multiparametric MRI in comparison to the standard PI-RADS 2.0 system and to assess its inter-reader variability. Materials and methods This IRB-approved study included 229 patients undergoing multiparametric prostate MRI prior to MRI-guided TRUS-based biopsy, which were retrospectively recruited from our prospectively maintained institutional database. Two readers with high (reader 1, 6 years) and low (reader 2, 2 years) level of expertise identified the lesion with the highest PI-RADS score for both version 2.0 and 2.1 for each patient. Inter-reader agreement was estimated, and diagnostic accuracy analysis was performed. Results Inter-reader agreement on PI-RADS scores was fair for both version 2.0 (kappa: 0.57) and 2.1 (kappa: 0.51). Detection rates for prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) were almost identical for both PI-RADS versions and higher for the more experienced reader (AUC, Reader 1: PCa, 0.881–0.887, csPCa, 0.874–0.879; Reader 2: PCa, 0.765, csPCa, 0.746–0.747; both p > 0.05), both when using a PI-RADS score of ≥ 4 and ≥3 as indicators for positivity for cancer. Conclusions The new PI-RADS 2.1 scoring system showed comparable diagnostic performance and inter-reader variability compared to version 2.0. The introduced changes in the version 2.1 seem only to take effect in a very small number of patients."
https://openalex.org/W3090387737,"Background Vitamin D deficiency in infants has been associated with an increased risk of a number of diseases but there are limited data on the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency from tropical settings with high infant morbidity and mortality. Objective To determine the prevalence and determinants of vitamin D deficiency in infants at birth and at six months of age in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia. Design Serum vitamin D of eligible infants was measured in cord blood at birth and at six months of age. Factors associated with vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <50 nmol/L) were collected prospectively monthly from birth and concentrations measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Independent risk factors were identified by multiple logistic regression. Results Between December 2015 to December 2017, 350 maternal-newborn participants were recruited and followed up. Vitamin D deficiency was detected in 90% (308/344) of cord blood samples and 13% (33/255) of venous blood samples at six months. Longer time outdoors (≥2 hours per day) and maternal multivitamin intake containing vitamin D during pregnancy were protective against vitamin D deficiency at birth (AOR: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01–0.90 and AOR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.06–0.68, respectively). Risk factors for vitamin D deficiency at six months included lower cumulative skin-sun exposure score (AOR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04–1.20), severe vitamin D deficiency at birth (AOR: 7.73, 95% CI: 1.20–49.60) and exclusive breastfeeding (AOR: 2.64, 95% CI: 1.07–6.49) until six months. Among exclusively breast fed (EBF) infants, a higher skin-sun exposure score was associated with reduced vitamin D deficiency risk. Conclusion In equatorial regions, the role of ‘safe’ morning sun exposure in infants and mothers in populations with medium to dark brown skin pigmentation and effective interventions to prevent vitamin D deficiency in newborns and EBF infants, need further consideration and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3090486498,"Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and infarct volume detected by brain imaging have been associated with stroke outcome. However, the relationship of these two variables with post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between acute serum VEGF levels and infarct volume with PSCI in ischemic stroke patients.Fifty-six first-ever ischemic stroke patients who were hospitalized in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia were prospectively recruited. Serum VEGF level was taken on day 5 of stroke onset and measured by ELISA. Infarct volume was calculated manually from head CT scan by expert radiologist. PSCI was assessed after 3 months follow up by using Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Indonesian version (MoCA-INA). We performed a ROC curve analysis to determine the cut-off point of VEGF level and infarct volume. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to measure the contribution of VEGF level and infarct volume to PSCI after controlling covariates (demographic and clinical data).The mean age of PSCI and non-PSCI patients was 61.63% ± 8.47 years and 58.67% ± 9.01 years, respectively (p = 0.221). No differences observed for vascular risk factors, infarct location, and NIHSS in both groups. Multivariate logistic regression showed that patients with higher VEGF level alone (≥519.8 pg/ml) were 4.99 times more likely to have PSCI than those with lower VEGF level (OR = 4.99, 95% CI = 1.01-24.7, p = 0.048). In addition, patients with larger infarct volume alone (≥0.054 ml) were also more frequently associated with PSCI (OR = 7.71, 95% CI = 1.39-42.91, p = 0.019).Acute ischemic stroke patients with higher serum VEGF level (≥519.8 pg/ml) and larger infarct volume (≥0.054 ml) were more likely to have PSCI 3 months after stroke. These findings may contribute to predict PSCI earlier and thus better prevention strategy could be made."
https://openalex.org/W3091638357,"Objectives More and more evidence suggests oxidative stress and inflammation contribute importantly to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)-induced cerebral vasospasm and secondary brain injury. Recent evidence indicates Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) increases the expression of antioxidant genes and decreases the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. This study examines the effects of an activator of Nfr2, RTA 408, on SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm and possible mechanism underlying its effect in a two-hemorrhage rodent model of SAH. Methods We randomly assigned 60 Sprague-Dawley male rats (350 to 420g) to five groups twelve rats each: one control group (no SAH), one untreated SAH only group and three RTA-408 treatment groups (SAH+ RTA 408 0.5 mg/kg/day, SAH+RTA 408 1 mg/kg/day and a SAH+RTA 408 1.5 mg/kg/day). The treatment groups were administered RTA 408 by intraperitoneal injection thirty min following first induction of SAH for seven days starting with first hemorrhage. Cerebral vasospasm was determined by averaging the cross-sectional areas of basilar artery 7 days after first SAH. Expressions of Nrf2, NF-κB and iNOS in basilar artery and expressions of Nrf2, HO-1, NQO1 and Cleaved caspase-3 were evaluated. Tissue TNF-alpha was assessed by ELISA using the protein sampled from the dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus. Results Prior to perfusion fixation, there were no significant physiological differences among the control and treated groups. RTA 408 treatment attenuated the morphological changes caused by cerebral vasospasm. It mitigated SAH-induced suppression of Nrf2 and increased expression of NF-κB and iNOS in the basilar artery. In dentate gyrus, it reversed SAH-decreases in Nrf2, HO-1, NQO-1 and cleaved caspase-3 and RTA 408 1.5 mg/kg/day reversed SAH increases in TNF-alpha. Conclusion It was concluded that RTA 408 reversal vasospasm was achieved via increases in Nrf2 and decreases in NF-κB and iNOS. It exerted a neuron-protection effect by decreasing the apoptosis-related protein cleaved caspase-3 and decreasing the information cytokine TNF-alpha expression, which it achieved by increasing HO-1 and NQO-1 protein found downstream from Nrf2 and Nrf2. We believe that RTA 408 can potentially be used to manage of cerebral vasospasm and secondary brain injury following SAH."
https://openalex.org/W3090495566,"Background We hypothesized that spatial heterogeneity exists between recurrent and non-recurrent regions within a tumor. The aim of this study was to determine if there is a difference between radiomics features derived from recurrent versus non recurrent regions within the tumor based on pre-treatment MRI. Methods A total of 14 T4NxM0 NPC patients with histologically proven “in field” recurrence in the post nasal space following curative intent IMRT were included in this study. Pretreatment MRI were co-registered with MRI at the time of recurrence for the delineation of gross tumor volume at diagnosis(GTV) and at recurrence(GTVr). A total of 7 histogram features and 40 texture features were computed from the recurrent(GTVr) and non-recurrent region(GTV-GTVr). Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were carried out on the 47 quantified radiomics features. Results A total of 7 features were significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent regions. Other than the variance from intensity-based histogram, the remaining six significant features were either from the gray-level size zone matrix (GLSZM) or the neighbourhood gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM). Conclusions The radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment MRI can potentially reflect the difference between recurrent and non-recurrent regions within a tumor and has a potential role in pre-treatment identification of intra-tumoral radio-resistance for selective dose escalation."
https://openalex.org/W3089779749,"We study the discursive resonance of online climate skepticism in traditional media in Germany, a country where climate skeptics lack public prestige and thus form a political counter-movement. We thereby differentiate two temporal dynamics: resonance can be continuous or selective, based on the exploitation of specific events. Beyond, we test whether such resonance is higher within the conservative media. We rely on news value theory to shed light on the mechanism facilitating or hindering such resonance and identify three indicators for resonance: frames, positions and actors. Using various computational methods as well as qualitative case studies, we examine the skeptical and traditional media discourses over a period of two years. Our analysis shows that there is no continuous resonance. However, our data reveal selective resonance: skeptics’ manage to exploit specific events pushing their frames and positions onto traditional media’s agenda. Thereby, conservative media did not give greater resonance to climate skeptical voices whereas they resort to downplaying the issue by allocating less space to it."
https://openalex.org/W3091101677,"Background Enteral nutrition (EN) is a ubiquitous intervention in ICU patients but there is uncertainty regarding the optimal dose, timing and importance for patient-centered outcomes during critical illness. Our research group has previously found an improved protein balance during normocaloric versus hypocaloric parenteral nutrition in neurosurgical ICU patients. We now wanted to investigate if this could be demonstrated in a general ICU population with established enteral feeding, including patients on renal replacement therapy. Methods Patients with EN >80% of energy target as determined by indirect calorimetry were randomized to or 50% or 100% of current EN rate. After 24 hours, whole-body protein kinetics were determined by enteral and parenteral stable isotope tracer infusions. Treatment allocation was then switched, and tracer investigations repeated 24 hours later in a crossover design with patients serving as their own controls. Results Six patients completed the full protocol. During feeding with 100% EN all patients received >1.2 g/kg/day of protein. Mean whole-body protein balance increased from -6.07 to 2.93 µmol phenylalanine/kg/h during 100% EN as compared to 50% (p = 0.044). The oxidation rate of phenylalanine was unaltered (p = 0.78). Conclusions It is possible to assess whole-body protein turnover using a stable isotope technique in critically ill patients during enteral feeding and renal replacement therapy. Our results also suggest a better whole-body protein balance during full dose as compared to half dose EN. As the sample size was smaller than anticipated, this finding should be confirmed in larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W3089384369,"Trans individuals (e.g. trans men and women, non-binary, gender fluid) are at higher risk for mental health concerns, in part due to marginalization. Previous work has documented the effects of social support and community engagement on health outcomes. However, individuals’ perceptions of community engagement effects may point to opportunities for intervention. This mixed methods study examines trans individuals’ perceived effects of participating in trans communities on health outcomes. Semi-structured in-person interviews were conducted with 20 individuals, and 60 individuals participated in cross-sectional online surveys. Perceived discrimination had a strong negative association with self-assessed mental health. Effects of participation included a) positive: contextualization and normalization of experience, self-appraisal, safety, and relief; and b) neutral/negative: energy drain and stigmatization. Effects of not participating included loneliness, depression, isolation, hiding identity, and losing resources. Both discrimination and non-participation in trans communities had negative effects on mental health. Though community participation is often discussed as positive for marginalized populations, it may be important to include possible negative effects (such as energy drain) in research."
https://openalex.org/W3091264703,"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a retrovirus that causes lymphoma in cattle worldwide and has also been associated with breast cancer in humans. The mechanism of BLV infection in humans and its implication as a primary cause of cancer in women are not known yet. BLV infection in humans may be caused by the consumption of milk and milk-products or meat from infected animals. Breast cancer incidence rates in Brazil are high, corresponding to 29.5% a year of cancer cases among women. In 2020, an estimated 66,280 new cases of breast cancer are expected, whereas in 2018 breast cancer has led to 17,572 deaths, the highest incidence and lethality among cancers in women in this country that year. BLV infection occurrence ranges from 60 to 95% in dairy herds. In addition, there are some regions, such as the Minas Gerais State, southeastern Brazil, where the population traditionally consume unpasteurized dairy products. Taken together, this study aimed to verify if there is a higher association between breast cancer and the presence of BLV genome in breast tissue samples within this population that consumes raw milk from animals with high rates of BLV infection. A molecular study of two BLV genes was carried out in 88 breast parenchyma samples, between tumors and controls. The amplified fragment was subjected to BLV proviral sequencing and its identity was confirmed using GenBank. BLV proviral genes were amplified from tumor breast parenchyma samples and healthy tissue control samples from women, revealing a 95.9% (47/49) and 59% (23/39) positivity, respectively. Our results show the highest correlation of BLV and human breast cancer found in the world to date within the population of Minas Gerais, Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W3091636540,"Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the most common congenital malformations. The objective of our study was to evaluate the prenatal screening accuracy of congenital heart disease (CHD) in Southern France and to evaluate the impact of a prenatal diagnosis on pregnancies outcomes and neonatal outcomes. We performed a bicentric, retrospective observational study in the southern region over 4 years was conducted between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. All foetuses and children under one year of age with CHD monitored in the UTHs (University Teaching Hospitals) in Marseille and Nice were included. CHD cases were divided into 3 groups: group 1, those with no possible options for anatomical repair; group 2, those with anatomical repair possibilities but that may require neonatal cardiologic management; and group 3, those with anatomical repair possibilities that do not require an emergency neonatal procedure. Among the 249070 deliveries during the study period, 677 CHD cases were included in the study. The overall prenatal screening rate was 71.5%. The screening rates were 97.8%, 63.6%, and 65.9% for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Among group 2 CHD cases, 80% of the transpositions of the great arteries, 56% of the aortic coarctations, and 20% of the total anomalous pulmonary venous returns were detected during the prenatal period. A genetic anomaly was found in 16% of CHD cases. The overall mortality rate was 11.3% with a higher death rate in cases of prenatal screening (17.2% versus 2.1%; p < 0.001). However, when focusing only on children who died of CHD, prenatal screening did not create an impact (56.6% versus 100%, p = 0,140). Our data showed that the prenatal screening rate of CHD appears satisfactory in Southern France. Nevertheless, it could be improved for some CHD. This study did not find any benefit in terms of mortality from prenatal screening for CHD."

https://openalex.org/W3090878890,"Worldwide, the genus Ranunculus includes approximately 600 species and is highly genetically diverse. Recent taxonomic reports suggest that the genus has a monophyletic origin, divided into two subgenera, and consists of 17 sections. The Central Asian country of Kazakhstan has 62 species of the genus that have primarily been collected in the central part of the country. The latest collection trips in southern parts of the country have led to the description of a wider distribution area for Ranunculus and the identification of a new species Ranunculus talassicus Schegol. et A.L. Ebel from Western Tien Shan. Therefore, in this study, attempts were made to assess the molecular taxonomic positions of R. talassicus and two other species endemic to the Central Asian region R. karkaralensis Schegol. and R. pskemensis V.N. Pavlov in relation to other species of the genus, using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) molecular genetic markers. The ITS-aligned sequences of 22 local Central Asian accessions and 43 accession sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database allowed the construction of a maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree and a Neighbor-Net network. The results indicated that R. talassicus and R. pskemensis could be assigned to section Ranunculastrum. Additionally, an assessment of the network suggested that R. pskemensis was the rooting taxon for the group of species containing R. talassicus, and that R. illyricus L. and R. pedatus Waldst. & Kit. were founders of a prime rooting node for the Ranunculastrum section of the genus. The ITS-aligned sequences showed that R. karkaralensis was indifferent with respect to three other species in the Ranunculus section of the genus, i.e., R. acris L., R. grandifolius C.A. Mey., and R. subborealis Tzvelev. The study indicated that the assessments of ITS-based phylogenetic tree and Neighbor-Net network provided new insights into the taxonomic positions of three endemic species from Central Asia."
https://openalex.org/W3091031795,"Long-term use of colistin for preventing Gram-negative bacterial infections in food animals was prohibited in Thailand in 2017, but it is permitted for short-term treatment. This study aimed to investigate association between the use of colistin for short-term treatment of infection and the emergence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in swine. The current study was conducted at 2 selected swine farms in Thailand. Neither farm has used colistin to prevent infection for longer than 1 year. Rectal swabs were collected from the same 66 pigs at birth, and on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 60. Colistin was used to treat sick pigs for up to 3 days. Additional rectal swabs were collected during colistin treatment. Rectal swabs were analyzed for colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and the mcr-1 gene. Results revealed that colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were absent at birth. Some pigs at both farms had diarrhea and received colistin treatment during days 2–27. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 13.3–50.0% of sick and healthy pigs. No sick pigs were observed during days 28–60, and colistin was not used during that period. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 2.8–10.0% of healthy pigs on day 28, and in 0–3.4% of healthy pigs on day 60. The mcr-1 gene was detected in 57.6% of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates. Short-term treatment with colistin was found to be associated with the emergence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in swine. Colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae rapidly emerged after colistin use, and rapidly decreased or disappeared after its discontinuation."
https://openalex.org/W3090067178,"Ever since the grey system theory was proposed about 40 years ago, its characteristics such as small samples, few data, and uncertainty have been used for study in the literature with increasingly wider scope. Recent studies on grey relation analysis have included static data analyses, and most of them have adopted initial values with only a relational order. Under the same study conditions, if different data preprocessing methods are used, then the relational order will be ranked differently. This study took Taiwan as the object to explore seven economic indices (birth rate (%), Taiwan’s total population (thousand people), unemployment rate (%), income per capita (USD), weighted average interest rate on deposits (%), Consumer Price Index (CPI), and national income (NI)) and how they affect the economic growth rate. The traditional static grey relational analysis treated the collected data with taking consideration of time effect which is irrational under some circumstance. An innovative dynamic grey relational analysis was carried out by shifting the raw data due to the time leading or lagging effect which is a mean to improve the capability of traditional grey relational analysis. The differences in analyses between static grey relational analysis and dynamic grey relational analysis via different data preprocessing methods were further discussed, finding that different data preprocessing methods generated a new set of relational orders through the latter. Finally, the prosperity index was used to identify the effects of all factors on economic growth (leading, synchronization, and lagging indices)."
https://openalex.org/W3091524277,"Introduction While drug prescription should be based on established recommendations stemming from clinical trials but in pediatrics, many drugs are used without marketing authorization. Consequently recommendations are often based on clinical experience and the risk of inappropriate prescription (IP) is high. A tool for detecting IP in pediatrics—called POPI (Pediatrics: Omission of Prescriptions and Inappropriate prescriptions)—has been developed in France. However the relevance of its use at an international level is not known. Our aim has been to adapt POPI for a worldwide use. Material and method A two-round Delphi online questionnaire was completed and validated by international experts to identify consensual items. They were asked to rate the validity of each items taking into account the recommendations and practices in their countries. Only propositions obtaining a median score in the upper tertile with an agreement of more than 75% of the panel—for the first round—and 85%—for the second round—were retained. Results Our panel included 11 pharmacists (55%) and 9 physicians (45%). The panelists came from 12 different countries: England, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Ivory Coast, Ireland, Malaysia, Portugal, Switzerland, Turkey and Vietnam. At the end of the first round, of the 105 items of the original POPI tool, 80 items were retained including 16 items reworded and 25 items were deleted. In the second round, 14 experts participated in the study. This final international POPI tool is composed of 73 IP and omissions of prescriptions in the fields of neuropsychiatry, dermatology, infectiology, pneumology, gastroenterology, pain and fever. Discussion and conclusion This study highlights international consensus on prescription practice in pediatrics. The use of this tool in everyday practice could reduce the risk of inappropriate prescription. The impact of the diffusion of POPI tool will be assessed in a prospective multicentric study."

Methods For the clinical domain of HIV, we searched data sharing platforms and acquired a set of 18 HIV related studies from which we analyzed 26 328 data elements. We identified existing standards for creating a data dictionary and reviewed their use. To facilitate aggregation across studies, we defined three types of data dictionary (data element, forms, and permissible values) and created a simple information model for each type. Results An average study had 427 data elements (ranging from 46 elements to 9 945 elements). In terms of data type, 48.6% of data elements were string, 47.8% were numeric, 3.0% were date and 0.6% were date-time. No study in our sample explicitly declared a data element as a categorical variable and rather considered them either strings or numeric. Only for 61% of studies were we able to obtain permissible values. The majority of studies used CSV files to share a data dictionary while 22% of the studies used a non-computable, PDF format. All studies grouped their data elements. The average number of groups or forms per study was 24 (ranging between 2 and 124 groups/forms). An accurate and well formatted data dictionary facilitates error-free secondary analysis and can help with data de-identification. Conclusion We saw features of data dictionaries that made them difficult to use and understand. This included multiple data dictionary files or non-machine-readable documents, data elements included in data but not in the dictionary or missing data types or descriptions. Building on experience with aggregating data elements across a large set of studies, we created a set of recommendations (called CONSIDER statement) that can guide optimal data sharing of future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3089344166,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in humans and is a public health concern worldwide. We evaluated the performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) for the diagnosis of TBM. In addition, genetic diversity and drug susceptibility profiling of Mtb strains isolated from TBM patients were also investigated. A total of 293 TBM suspected cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and subjected to GeneXpert and Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT 960) culture, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of GeneXpert was 72.7% and 98.5%, respectively by using MGIT 960 as a gold standard (GeneXpert (n = 20, 6.8%) vs MGIT 960 (n = 22, 7.5%)). All Mtb positive cultures were subjected to 24-locus Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing, Line probe assay (LPA) and MGIT 960- Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST). The rpoB gene was amplified and sequenced for selected isolates. Among our TBM patients, East African Indian (EAI) lineage (n = 16, 72.7%) was most predominant followed by Beijing (n = 3, 13.6%), S-family (n = 2, 9.1%) and Delhi/CAS (n = 1, 4.5%). Three Mtb strains were found to be Isoniazid (INH) resistant by MGIT 960; however LPA revealed that two strains were INH resistant and one strain was multi drug resistant (MDR) (Resistant to Isoniazid and Rifampicin (RIF)). We identified rifampicin resistant isolate with the mutation D516F in rifampicin resistance-determining region (RRDR) and observed discordant results between LPA, GeneXpert and MGIT 960. In addition, GeneXpert showing false RIF resistance was identified (no mutation in RRDR). We conclude that GeneXpert is useful for the diagnostic confirmation of TBM; however a GeneXpert negative sample should be subjected to MGIT 960 culture or LPA to rule out TBM. EAI lineage was the most predominant among TBM patients in South India and associated with drug resistance. The discordance between GeneXpert, MGIT 960 and LPA with respect to rifampicin resistance has to be ruled out to avoid TB treatment failure or relapse."
https://openalex.org/W3089825191,"Antenatal corticosteroid (ACS) administration has been known as one of the most effective treatment in perinatal medicine, but the beneficial effects of ACS may vary not only gestational age, but also the quality of perinatal and neonatal care of the institution. This nationwide cohort study of the Korean Neonatal Network (KNN) data was consisted of <1,500g infants born at 23–34 weeks at 67 KNN hospitals between 2013 and 2017. The 9,142 eligible infants were assigned into two groups–group 1 and 2 <50% and ≥50% mortality rate, respectively, for 23–24 weeks’ gestation–reflecting the quality of perinatal and neonatal care. Each group of infants were further stratified into 23–24, 25–26, 27–28, and 29–34 weeks of gestation age. Despite comparable ACS usage between group 1 (82%) and group 2 (81%), the benefits of ACS were only observed in group 1. In the multivariable analyses, infants of group 1 showed significant decrease in mortality and IVH at gestational age 23–24 weeks with ACS use, and the decrease was also seen in early-onset sepsis and respiratory distress syndrome at gestational age of 29–34 weeks while there were no significant decrease in group 2. In this study the overall data was congruent with the previous findings stating that ACS use decreases mortality and morbidity. These results indicate that the improved mortality of infants at 23–24 weeks’ gestation reflects the quality improvement of perinatal and neonatal intensive care, which is a prerequisite to the benefits of ACS."
https://openalex.org/W3090279043,"For the complicated operation process, many risk factors, and long cycle of urban logistics, it is difficult to manage the security of urban logistics and it enhances the risk. Therefore, to study a set of effective management mode for the safe operation of urban logistics and improve the risk prediction mechanism, is the primary research item of urban logistics security management. This paper summarizes the risk factors to public security in the process of urban logistics, including pick up, warehouse storage, transport, and the end distribution. Generalized regression neural network (GRNN) is combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict accidents, and the Apriori algorithm is used to analyze the combination of high-frequency risk factors. The results show that the method of combining GRNN with PSO is effective in accident prediction and has a powerful generalization ability. It can prevent the occurrence of unnecessary urban logistics public accidents, improve the ability of relevant departments to deal with emergency incidents, and minimize the impact of urban logistics accidents on social and public security."
https://openalex.org/W3091173904,"Finding a model-based optimal design that can optimally discriminate among a class of plausible models is a difficult task because the design criterion is non-differentiable and requires 2 or more layers of nested optimization. We propose hybrid algorithms based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) to solve such optimization problems, including cases when the optimal design is singular, the mean response of some models are not fully specified and problems that involve 4 layers of nested optimization. Using several classical examples, we show that the proposed PSO-based algorithms are not models or criteria specific, and with a few repeated runs, can produce either an optimal design or a highly efficient design. They are also generally faster than the current algorithms, which are generally slow and work for only specific models or discriminating criteria. As an application, we apply our techniques to find optimal discriminating designs for a dose-response study in toxicology with 5 possible models and compare their performances with traditional and a recently proposed algorithm. In the supplementary material, we provide a R package to generate different types of discriminating designs and evaluate efficiencies of competing designs so that the user can implement an informed design."

https://openalex.org/W3090857627,"Crossover rates and localization are not homogeneous throughout the genomes. Along the chromosomes of almost all species, domains with high crossover rates alternate with domains where crossover rates are significantly lower than the genome-wide average. The distribution of crossovers along chromosomes constitutes the recombination landscape of a given species and can be analyzed at broadscale using immunostaining of the MLH1 protein, a component of mature recombination nodules found on synaptonemal complexes during pachytene. We scored the MLH1 foci in oocytes of the chicken and the guinea fowl and compared their frequencies in the largest bivalents. The average autosomal number of foci is 62 in the chicken and 44 in the guinea fowl. The lower number in the guinea fowl responds to the occurrence of fewer crossovers in the six largest bivalents, where most MLH1 foci occur within one-fifth of the chromosome length with high polarization towards opposite ends. The skewed distribution of foci in the guinea fowl contrast with the more uniform distribution of numerous foci in the chicken, especially in the four largest bivalents. The crossover distribution observed in the guinea fowl is unusual among Galloanserae and also differs from other, more distantly related birds. We discussed the current evidence showing that the shift towards crossover localization, as observed in the guinea fowl, was not a unique event but also occurred at different moments of bird evolution. A comparative analysis of genome-wide average recombination rates in birds shows variations within narrower limits compared to mammals and the absence of a phylogenetic trend."
https://openalex.org/W3091081735,"Anemia in women of reproductive age is highly prevalent globally and remains a public health problem. In Ethiopia, despite efforts to minimize the burden of anemia, it is still a moderate public health problem. Anemia has various etiologies including nutritional deficiency, parasitic infection, and inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine contributing factors to anemia in lactating women. Following ethical approval, and six months after delivery, all lactating women (n = 150) were recruited to participate in this study from eight randomly selected rural villages. Anthropometric and socio-economic factors were assessed. From each, a blood sample was collected for measuring hemoglobin, iron biomarkers, zinc, selenium, and inflammation markers. The median (IQR) hemoglobin (Hb) was 132 (123, 139) g/L. Of the women, 19% were anemic and 7% had iron deficiency anemia; 31% were iron deficient and 2% had iron overload. Also, 8% had functional iron deficit, 6% had acute inflammation, 13% had chronic inflammation, and 16% had tissue iron deficiency. The majority (78%) of the women had low plasma zinc out of which more than 16% were anemic. Hb was positively associated with plasma iron and plasma zinc and negatively associated with transferrin receptor (TfR) and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). Plasma iron, AGP, TfR, hepcidin and plasma zinc were significant predictors of maternal anemia. Additionally MUAC and level of education were associated positively with maternal hemoglobin. This study showed that maternal anemia was associated with multiple factors including nutritional deficiencies, inflammation and limited education."
https://openalex.org/W3090595791,"Background Traumatized refugees often suffer from diverse psychosomatic symptoms. Female Yazidi refugees from Northern Iraq who survived attacks of the so-called “Islamic State” were brought to Germany to receive special medical and psychotherapeutic treatment in a unique worldwide humanitarian admission program (HAP). Here, we report on their psychosomatic symptoms and helpful strategies from the perspective of care providers. Methods Care providers (N = 84) in this HAP were interviewed in an individual setting as well as in focus groups to gather information about the HAP beneficiaries’ psychosomatic symptoms. Data analysis followed Qualitative Content Analysis by Mayring. Results The care providers reported five main psychological burdens of the Yazidis: 1) insecurity regarding loss, 2) worries about family members, 3) ambivalence about staying in Germany or returning to Iraq, 4) life between two worlds and 5) re-actualization of the traumatic experiences. The predominant psychological symptoms the care providers noticed were fear, depressive symptoms, feelings of guilt, and sleep and eating disorders. Regarding somatic symptoms, the care providers mainly received complaints about pain in the head, back, chest and stomach. Helpful strategies for providing adequate health care were care providers’ cooperating with physicians, precise documentation of beneficiaries’ symptoms, and additional support in directing the beneficiaries through the health care system. Regarding psychotherapy, interpreters help to overcome language barriers, onsite psychotherapy, flexible therapy appointments, psychoeducational methods, time for stabilization, and support in coping with daily life aspects. In the care providers’ experience, psychotherapists have to build a relationship of trust. After grief therapy, a trauma-specific therapy in a culturally adapted way is possible. Conclusion The HAP is a unique model health care program to offer highly traumatized refugees medical and psychological help. Care providers reported on several (psycho-)somatic symptoms of the traumatized women. The strategies the HAP care providers perceived as helpful can be recommended for similar projects in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3091301381,"Background To evaluate chest-computed-tomography (CT) scans in coronavirus-disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients for signs of organizing pneumonia (OP) and microinfarction as surrogate for microscopic thromboembolic events. Methods Real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patients undergoing chest-CT (non-enhanced, enhanced, pulmonary-angiography [CT-PA]) from March-April 2020 were retrospectively included (COVID-19-cohort). As control-groups served 175 patients from 2020 (cohort-2020) and 157 patients from 2019 (cohort-2019) undergoing CT-PA for pulmonary embolism (PE) during the respective time frame at our institution. Two independent readers assessed for presence and location of PE in all three cohorts. In COVID-19 patients additionally parenchymal changes typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, infarct pneumonia and OP were assessed. Inter-reader agreement and prevalence of PE in different cohorts were calculated. Results From 68 COVID-19 patients (42 female [61.8%], median age 59 years [range 32–89]) undergoing chest-CT 38 obtained CT-PA. Inter-reader-agreement was good (k = 0.781). On CT-PA, 13.2% of COVID-19 patients presented with PE whereas in the control-groups prevalence of PE was 9.1% and 8.9%, respectively (p = 0.452). Up to 50% of COVID-19 patients showed changes typical for OP. 21.1% of COVID-19 patients suspected with PE showed subpleural wedge-shaped consolidation resembling infarct pneumonia, while only 13.2% showed visible filling defects of the pulmonary artery branches on CT-PA. Conclusion Despite the reported hypercoagulability in critically ill patients with COVID-19, we did not encounter higher prevalence of PE in our patient cohort compared to the control cohorts. However, patients with suspected PE showed a higher prevalence of lung changes, resembling patterns of infarct pneumonia or OP and CT-signs of pulmonary-artery hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3091357661,"In the past two decades, research into the biochemical, biophysical and structural properties of the ribosome have revealed many different steps of protein translation. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of how they lead to a rapid and accurate protein synthesis still remains a challenge. Here we consider a coarse network analysis in the bacterial ribosome formed by the connectivity between ribosomal (r) proteins and RNAs at different stages in the elongation cycle. The ribosomal networks are found to be dis-assortative and small world, implying that the structure allows for an efficient exchange of information between distant locations. An analysis of centrality shows that the second and fifth domains of 23S rRNA are the most important elements in all of the networks. Ribosomal protein hubs connect to much fewer nodes but are shown to provide important connectivity within the network (high closeness centrality). A modularity analysis reveals some of the different functional communities, indicating some known and some new possible communication pathways Our mathematical results confirm important communication pathways that have been discussed in previous research, thus verifying the use of this technique for representing the ribosome, and also reveal new insights into the collective function of ribosomal elements."
https://openalex.org/W3089827056,"Recent researches on the control charts with unknown process parameters have noticed the large variability in the conditional in-control average run length (ARL) performance of control charts, especially when a small number of Phase I samples is used to estimate the process parameters. Some research works have been conducted on the conditional ARL performance of different types of control charts. In this paper, by simulating the empirical distribution of the conditional ARL and especially using the exceedance probability criterion (EPC), we study the conditional ARL performance of the synthetic [Formula: see text] chart. Our results show that a large amount of Phase I samples is needed to obtain a specified EPC of the synthetic chart. For the available number of Phase I samples, the control limits of the synthetic chart are adjusted using the EPC method to improve its conditional in-control performance. It is shown that, for small mean shift sizes, a tradeoff should be made between the conditional in-control and out-of-control performances. For moderate to large shifts, the conditional performance of the synthetic chart using the adjusted control limits is generally satisfied. By comparing the results with the ones using the bootstrap approach, it can also be concluded that the conditional performances of both approaches are comparable. While the method proposed in this paper requires much less computation work than the bootstrap approach."
https://openalex.org/W3090098484,"It is often critical to improve the limited regenerative capacity of the peripheral nerves and direct neural growth towards specific targets, such as surgically implanted bioengineered constructs. One approach to accomplish this goal is to use extrinsic neurotrophic factors. The candidate factors first need to be identified and characterized in in vitro tests for their ability to direct the neurite growth. Here, we present a simple guidance assay that allows to assess the chemotactic effect of signaling molecules on the growth of neuronal processes from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) using only standard tissue culture materials. We used this technique to quantitatively determine the combined and individual effects of the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on neurite outgrowth. We demonstrated that these two neurotrophic factors, when applied in a 1:1 combination, but not individually, induced directed growth of neuronal processes towards the source of the gradient. This chemotactic effect persists without significant changes over a wide (10-fold) concentration range. Moreover, we demonstrated that other, more general growth parameters that do not evaluate growth in a specific direction (such as, neurite length and trajectory) were differentially affected by the concentration of the CNTF/GNDF mixture. Furthermore, GDNF, when applied individually, did not have any chemotactic effect, but caused significant neurite elongation and an increase in the number of neurites per ganglion."
https://openalex.org/W3090326573,"The uncertainty of high technology has determined the high-risk character of high-tech projects. Thus, it is of great importance to effectively avoid the risk of high-tech projects by thoroughly analyzing projects' methodologies and fully understanding the technology prospect risk of projects in the feasibility study phase. This study proposes a systematic research framework to identify and analyze the technology prospect risk of projects based on patent analysis. Thus, text mining technology and principal component analysis are used to improve the traditional patent map method and construct a technology prospect risk map. Moreover, patent value evaluation and correlation analysis methods are combined to identify technology potential areas and calculate the value of technology prospect risk. At the same time, an empirical study is conducted with project cases in the field of optical communications, and the technology prospect risk situations of these projects are ascertained through qualitative and quantitative methods. The study is innovative and practical and offers a better combination of analysis methods for current technology development and specific projects."
https://openalex.org/W3090643280,"Background Women with hyperglycaemia first detected in pregnancy (HFDP), including those with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), should undergo a glucose evaluation 4–12 weeks after delivery. Globally, suboptimal postpartum return rates limit the opportunity to intervene in women with sustained hyperglycaemia and pragmatic solutions should be sought to bridge this gap. Objective To assess the utility of postpartum in-hospital glucose evaluation to predict the outcome of the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) performed 4–12 weeks after delivery. Methods The study was performed prospectively at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. Women with HFDP, classified as GDM based on the modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria, who delivered between November 2018 and June 2019 were included in the study. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was performed 24–72 hours after delivery (t1) in the postnatal ward, provided glucose lowering medication was discontinued at delivery. An OGTT 4–12 weeks postpartum (t2) was scheduled for the total cohort. We compared glucose values and glucose categories at t1 and t2 and evaluated antenatal characteristics of women who returned, compared to the group that was lost to follow-up. Results In-hospital post-delivery glucose assessment (t1) was performed in 115 women. Glucose levels were significantly lower at t1 compared to antenatal diagnostic values (t0) and assessment at t2. Of the fourteen women with hyperglycaemia at t2, none had abnormal fasting glucose concentrations at t1. Women with HFDP who fulfilled criteria for overt diabetes at t0, all (24/115) had normal fasting glucose levels at t1 except for IFG in one (1/24). The antenatal characteristics of women with HFDP who returned at t2, were similar to the women who did not return. Conclusion Based on this study, in-hospital fasting glucose 24–72 hours postpartum cannot replace the OGTT 4–12 weeks postpartum. Pragmatic solutions for low postpartum return rates in women with HFDP should be pursued."
https://openalex.org/W3090830779,"Objective To evaluate the location of transferred embryos under various parameters during embryo transfer in in vitro fertilization (IVF) by applying an in vitro experimental model for embryo transfer (ET). Methods Mock ET simulations were conducted with a laboratory model of the uterine cavity. The transfer catheter was loaded with a sequence of air and liquid volumes, including development-arrested embryos donated by patients. The transfer procedure was recorded using a digital video camera. An orthogonal design, including three independent variables (uterine orientation, distance of the catheter tip to the fundus, and injection speed) and one dependent variable (final embryo position), was applied. Results The uterine cavity was divided into six regions. The distribution of the transferred matter within the uterine cavity varied according to the uterine orientation. Medium speed-injected embryos were mostly found in the static region while fast- and slow-speed injected embryos were mostly found in the fundal region and the cervical-left region, respectively. The possibility of embryo separation from the air bubble increased from 11.1% in slow injection cases to 29.6% and 48.1% in medium and fast injection cases, respectively. Conclusion The experimental model provides a new method for investigating ET procedures. Fast injection of embryos into a retroverted uterus may be more likely to result in embryo separation from the air bubble."

However, there is a lack of understanding of the co-specialization and co-innovation among members of the innovation ecosystem. This paper addresses this gap. In this paper, the collaborative innovation between a platform firm and different kinds of complementors, and its effects on the performance of the innovation ecosystem are simulated through an improved NK model. The result shows that the co-innovation performance between generalist complementors and the platform firm is generally outperformed than that between the specialist complementors and the platform firm. As the interdependencies between the complementary components get stronger, the innovation performance of the innovation ecosystem influenced by the interaction between different types of complementors and platform firms tend to be an inverted U-shape."
https://openalex.org/W3090523920,"It is popularly believed that myasthenia gravis (MG) patients show acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChRAb) production associated with the thymus (germinal centers, approximately 80%). It has been suggested that thymectomy can remove the area of autoantibody production. This study aimed to determine whether the solid volume of the thymus calculated using three-dimensional (3D) imaging could be used to predict the efficacy of thymectomy. Additionally, the study assessed the relationships of the solid volume with germinal centers, change in the serum AChRAb level, postoperative MG improvement, and prednisolone (PSL) dose reduction extent.This retrospective study included 12 consecutive non-thymomatous MG patients (9 female and 3 male patients), who underwent extended thymectomy at our institution over the last 10 years. The mean patient age was 43.3 ± 14.2 years (range, 12-59 years). The study assessed the number of germinal centers per unit area, change in the serum AChRAb level, postoperative MG improvement, PSL dose reduction extent, and solid volume of the thymus.The number of germinal centers per unit area was significantly correlated with the solid volume of the thymus. The PSL dose reduction extent tended to be correlated with the solid volume.Our findings suggest that the solid volume of the thymus can possibly predict steroid dose reduction. Additionally, the solid volume of the thymus in 3D images is the most important indicator for predicting the efficacy of extended thymectomy."
https://openalex.org/W3090225087,"Public key cryptosystems such as RSA, rebalanced RSA and ElGamal have the disadvantage of serious asymmetry between encryption and decryption speed. We reduced the CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) exponents maintaining full sized private exponent in ElGamal with composite modulus (CRT–ElGamal) for the fast decryption as in rebalanced RSA. In this case, unlike rebalanced RSA, decryption speed up can be obtained without losing of the fast encryption speed which is comparable to RSA with small public exponent. As a result, it is possible to propose the fast public key cryptosystem in which both encryption and decryption are fast, by reducing the asymmetry (i.e., fast encryption/slow decryption) in CRT–ElGamal encryption."
https://openalex.org/W3090583215,"Objectives To investigate the association of mental health and subjective physical functioning with future antibiotic prescriptions. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting A rural town in Japan. Participants Participants who completed the baseline survey (2008-2010) of the Locomotive Syndrome and Health Outcomes in the Aizu Cohort Study (LOHAS) were recruited. Participants were limited to those without comorbidities according to the Charlson comorbidity index. Participants using antibiotics at baseline were excluded. Mental health and physical functioning were assessed using the Mental Health and Physical Functioning domains of the Short-Form 12 Health Survey, and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Mental Health Inventories at baseline. Main outcome measures The main outcome was antibiotic prescriptions found in claims data during 1 year after the baseline survey. Results A total of 967 participants were included in the analysis, and 151 (15.6%) participants with at least one missing variable for the confounding factors were excluded, leaving 816 participants for the primary analysis. Among the 816 participants, 65 (8.0%) were newly prescribed at least one antibiotic during the 1-year follow-up period. The most frequently prescribed antibiotics were third-generation cephalosporins (44 prescriptions; 35.5%), macrolides (28 prescriptions; 22.6%), and quinolones (23 prescriptions; 18.6%). A multivariable logistic regression analysis showed an association between higher mental health scores and future antibiotic prescriptions (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.40 per 1 standard deviation [SD] increase; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.90), whereas no significant relationship was observed between Physical Functioning scores and future antibiotic prescriptions (AOR, 0.95 per 1 SD increase; 95% CI, 0.75-1.22). During the secondary analysis, adults with depressive symptoms were less likely to be prescribed antibiotics (AOR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.70). Conclusions Better mental health was associated with increased future antibiotic prescriptions for healthy community-dwelling Japanese adults, suggesting that mentally healthier adults could be a target population for reducing antimicrobial use."
