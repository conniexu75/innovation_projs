https://openalex.org/W2101035994,"Features of chronic asthma include airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammatory infiltrates, and structural changes in the airways, termed remodeling. The contribution of eosinophils, cells associated with asthma and allergy, remains to be established. We show that in mice with a total ablation of the eosinophil lineage, increases in airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus secretion were similar to those observed in wild-type mice, but eosinophil-deficient mice were significantly protected from peribronchiolar collagen deposition and increases in airway smooth muscle. These data suggest that eosinophils contribute substantially to airway remodeling but are not obligatory for allergen-induced lung dysfunction, and support an important role for eosinophil-targeted therapies in chronic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2089920144,"Cell migration initiates by extension of the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge. Computational analysis of fluorescent speckle microscopy movies of migrating epithelial cells revealed this process is mediated by two spatially colocalized but kinematically, kinetically, molecularly, and functionally distinct actin networks. A lamellipodium network assembled at the leading edge but completely disassembled within 1 to 3 micrometers. It was weakly coupled to the rest of the cytoskeleton and promoted the random protrusion and retraction of the leading edge. Productive cell advance was a function of the second colocalized network, the lamella, where actomyosin contraction was integrated with substrate adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2140942460,"Eosinophils are often dominant inflammatory cells present in the lungs of asthma patients. Nonetheless, the role of these leukocytes remains poorly understood. We have created a transgenic line of mice (PHIL) that are specifically devoid of eosinophils, but otherwise have a full complement of hematopoietically derived cells. Allergen challenge of PHIL mice demonstrated that eosinophils were required for pulmonary mucus accumulation and the airway hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma. The development of an eosinophil-less mouse now permits an unambiguous assessment of a number of human diseases that have been linked to this granulocyte, including allergic diseases, parasite infections, and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1995573456,"The age and timing of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction have been difficult to determine because zircon populations from the type sections are typically affected by pervasive lead loss and contamination by indistinguishable older xenocrysts. Zircons from nine ash beds within the Shangsi and Meishan sections (China), pretreated by annealing followed by partial attack with hydrofluoric acid, result in suites of consistent and concordant uranium/lead (U/Pb) ages, eliminating the effects of lead loss. The U/Pb age of the main pulse of the extinction is 252.6 ± 0.2 million years, synchronous with the Siberian flood volcanism, and it occurred within the quoted uncertainty."

The Si Si triple-bond length (and its estimated standard deviation) is 2.0622(9) angstroms, which shows half the magnitude of the bond shortening of alkynes compared with that of alkenes. Unlike alkynes, the substituents at the Si Si group are not arranged in a linear fashion, but are trans-bent with a bond angle of 137.44(4)°."
https://openalex.org/W2134463512,"A new sign language has been created by deaf Nicaraguans over the past 25 years, providing an opportunity to observe the inception of universal hallmarks of language. We found that in their initial creation of the language, children analyzed complex events into basic elements and sequenced these elements into hierarchically structured expressions according to principles not observed in gestures accompanying speech in the surrounding language. Successive cohorts of learners extended this procedure, transforming Nicaraguan signing from its early gestural form into a linguistic system. We propose that this early segmentation and recombination reflect mechanisms with which children learn, and thereby perpetuate, language. Thus, children naturally possess learning abilities capable of giving language its fundamental structure."

https://openalex.org/W1981794368,"Despite the use of electrons with wavelengths of just a few picometers, spatial resolution in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) has been limited by spherical aberration to typically around 0.15 nanometer. Individual atomic columns in a crystalline lattice can therefore only be imaged for a few low-order orientations, limiting the range of defects that can be imaged at atomic resolution. The recent development of spherical aberration correctors for transmission electron microscopy allows this limit to be overcome. We present direct images from an aberration-corrected scanning TEM that resolve a lattice in which the atomic columns are sepa-rated by less than 0.1 nanometer."
https://openalex.org/W2070511571,"Magnesium/calcium data from Southern Ocean planktonic foraminifera demonstrate that high-latitude (∼55°S) southwest Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) cooled 6° to 7°C during the middle Miocene climate transition (14.2 to 13.8 million years ago). Stepwise surface cooling is paced by eccentricity forcing and precedes Antarctic cryosphere expansion by ∼60 thousand years, suggesting the involvement of additional feedbacks during this interval of inferred low-atmospheric partial pressure of CO 2 ( p CO 2 ). Comparing SSTs and global carbon cycling proxies challenges the notion that episodic p CO 2 drawdown drove this major Cenozoic climate transition. SST, salinity, and ice-volume trends suggest instead that orbitally paced ocean circulation changes altered meridional heat/vapor transport, triggering ice growth and global cooling."
https://openalex.org/W1967215284,"To explore natural biodiversity we developed and examined introgression lines (ILs) containing chromosome segments of wild species (Solanum pennellii) in the background of the cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum). We identified Brix9-2-5, which is a S. pennellii quantitative trait locus (QTL) that increases sugar yield of tomatoes and was mapped within a flower- and fruit-specific invertase (LIN5). QTL analysis representing five different tomato species delimited the functional polymorphism of Brix9-2-5 to an amino acid near the catalytic site of the invertase crystal, affecting enzyme kinetics and fruit sink strength. These results underline the power of diverse ILs for high-resolution perspectives on complex phenotypes."

https://openalex.org/W2056942192,"Meteorites and their components have anomalous oxygen isotopic compositions characterized by large variations in 18 O/ 16 O and 17 O/ 16 O ratios. On the basis of recent observations of star-forming regions and models of accreting protoplanetary disks, we suggest that these variations may originate in a parent molecular cloud by ultraviolet photodissociation processes. Materials with anomalous isotopic compositions were then transported into the solar nebula by icy dust grains during the collapse of the cloud. The icy dust grains drifted toward the Sun in the disk, and their subsequent evaporation resulted in the 17 O- and 18 O-enrichment of the inner disk gas."
https://openalex.org/W1992181243,"Germ-line mutations inactivating BRCA2 predispose to cancer. BRCA2-deficient cells exhibit alterations in chromosome number (aneuploidy), as well as structurally aberrant chromosomes. Here, we show that BRCA2 deficiency impairs the completion of cell division by cytokinesis. BRCA2 inactivation in murine embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and HeLa cells by targeted gene disruption or RNA interference delays and prevents cell cleavage. Impeded cell separation is accompanied by abnormalities in myosin II organization during the late stages in cytokinesis. BRCA2 may have a role in regulating these events, as it localizes to the cytokinetic midbody. Our findings thus link cytokinetic abnormalities to a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by chromosomal instability and may help to explain why BRCA2-deficient tumors are frequently aneuploid."
https://openalex.org/W2061166453,"The arrangement of water molecules around a hydrated electron has eluded explanation for more than 40 years. Here we report sharp vibrational bands for small gas-phase water cluster anions, (H2O)(4-6)- and (D2O)(4-6)-. Analysis of these bands reveals a detailed picture of the diffuse electron-binding site. The electron is closely associated with a single water molecule attached to the supporting network through a double H-bond acceptor motif. The local OH stretching bands of this molecule are dramatically distorted in the pentamer and smaller clusters because the excited vibrational levels are strongly coupled to the electron continuum. The vibration-to-electronic energy transfer rates, as revealed by line shape analysis, are mode-specific and remarkably fast, with the symmetric stretching mode surviving for less than 10 vibrational periods [50 fs in (H2O)4-]."

https://openalex.org/W2074182576,"Growth and development of the Caenorhabditis elegans foregut (pharynx) depends on coordinated gene expression, mediated by pharynx defective (PHA)-4/FoxA in combination with additional, largely unidentified transcription factors. Here, we used whole genome analysis to establish clusters of genes expressed in different pharyngeal cell types. We created an expectation maximization algorithm to identify cis-regulatory elements that activate expression within the pharyngeal gene clusters. One of these elements mediates the response to environmental conditions within pharyngeal muscles and is recognized by the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) DAF-12. Our data suggest that PHA-4 and DAF-12 endow the pharynx with transcriptional plasticity to respond to diverse developmental and physiological cues. Our combination of bioinformatics and in vivo analysis has provided a powerful means for genome-wide investigation of transcriptional control."

Here we show that infusion of forskolin, a specific cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) activator, into the lateral ventricle of brain in adult rats induced activation of PKA by severalfold and concurrently enhanced the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214, Ser-198, Ser-199, and or Ser-202 (Tau-1 site) and Ser-396 and or Ser-404 (PHF-1 site), which are among the major abnormally hyperphosphorylated sites seen in AD. PKA activation positively correlated to the extent of tau phosphorylation at these sites. Infusion of forskolin together with PKA inhibitor or glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor revealed that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 was catalyzed by PKA and that the phosphorylation at both the Tau-1 and the PHF-1 sites is induced by basal level of GSK-3, because forskolin activated PKA and not GSK-3 and inhibition of the latter inhibited the phosphorylation at Tau-1 and PHF-1 sites. Inhibition of cdc2, cdk5, or MAPK had no significant effect on the forskolin-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau. Forskolin inhibited spatial memory in a dose-dependent manner in the absence but not in the presence of Rp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate triethyl ammonium salt, a PKA inhibitor. These results demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of tau by PKA primes it for phosphorylation by GSK-3 at the Tau-1 and the PHF-1 sites and that an associated loss in spatial memory is inhibited by inhibition of the hyperphosphorylation of tau. These data provide a novel mechanism of the hyperphosphorylation of tau and identify both PKA and GSK-3 as promising therapeutic targets for AD and other tauopathies.

It is believed that several protein kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of tau, and no single kinase can phosphorylate all of these sites. Among more than ten protein kinases that have been shown to phosphorylate tau in vitro, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), cyclin-dependent kinases 5 (cdk5), cell division cycle 2 kinase (cdc2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), calcium- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are some of the most implicated in the regulation of tau phosphorylation and in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in AD brain (for review, see Refs. 17Iqbal K.

Phosphorylation of tau by one kinase may facilitate or inhibit the phosphorylation by other protein kinases at the same or other phosphorylation sites of tau in vitro (24Singh T.J. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1996; 154: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Sengupta A. Kabat J. Novak M. Wu Q. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Arch. Biochem.

Previously we found that phosphorylation of tau by PKA significantly promotes subsequent tau phosphorylation by GSK-3 at multiple phosphorylation sites in vitro (24Singh T.J. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1996; 154: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Wang J.Z. Wu Q. Smith A. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, it was not known whether this type of regulation of tau phosphorylation occurred in vivo. In the present study, we show that activation of PKA by infusion of forskolin in the lateral ventricle of the brain in adult rats enhanced phosphorylation of tau in hippocampus not only at Ser-214, a PKA site, but also at GSK-3 sites, Ser-198, Ser-199, and/or Ser-202 (Tau-1 site) and Ser-396 and/or Ser-404 (PHF-1 site). The increase in the phosphorylation of tau at the Tau-1 site and the PHF-1 site by GSK-3 occurred due to the priming of tau by PKA and not by any increase in GSK-3 activity. LiCl, which specifically inhibited GSK-3 activity but not other protein kinases such as PKA, cdc2, cdk5, and MAPKs, completely abolished the increase in the phosphorylation of tau at Tau-1 and PHF-1 sites but not at Ser-214. Furthermore, inhibition of cdc2, cdk5, and MAPK by specific respective inhibitors did not abolish the hyperphosphorylation of tau at Ser-214, Tau-1, and PHF-1 sites. In contrast, specific inhibition of PKA completely abolished the increase in the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214, Tau-1, and PHF-1 sites. Moreover, the forskolin-induced hyperphosphorylation of tau inhibited spatial memory in rats. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation facilitates tau phosphorylation by GSK-3 and associated loss in spatial memory, suggesting a role of PKA upstream to GSK-3 in the abnormal hyperphosphorylation and associated neurofibrillary degeneration and memory loss.

Surgical Procedures for Drug Infusion—Rats were first anesthetized by chloral hydrate (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and placed on a stereotactic instrument with the incisor bar set 2 mm below the ear bars (i.e. flat skull). After the scalp was incised and retracted, a 50-μl syringe (Hamilton) was stereotactically placed into the lateral ventricle of cerebrum at the co-ordinates from bregma and dura of anterior/posterior 0.8, lateral 1.5, and ventral 4 (in mm). Different concentrations of chemical compounds (see below, “Results”), separately or in combination, were injected (40 μl) into the left ventricle of the brain. The compounds were dissolved in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) composed of 140 mm NaCl, 3.0 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 1.2 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4. The same volume of aCSF was injected into the left ventricle for control animals. All surgical procedures were completed under sterile conditions and penicillin (200,000 units, intramuscularly) was injected to prevent infection (29Hauss-Wegrzyniak B. Dobrzanski P. Stoehr J.D. Wenk G.L. Brain Res. 1998; 780: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 30Bennecib M. Gong C.X. Wegiel J. Lee M.H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Alzheimers Rep. 2000; 3: 295-303Google Scholar). Preparation of Rat Hippocampal Extracts—Rats were killed 24 h after injection, following measurement of spatial memory. The hippocampus was immediately removed and homogenized at 4 °C using a Teflon glass homogenizer in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin. The tissue homogenates were then divided into two portions. One portion of each homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatant was stored at –80 °C for assaying activities of protein kinases. The other portion was mixed in 2:1 (v/v) ratio with lysis buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, boiled for 10 min in a water bath, then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was stored at –80 °C for Western blot analysis. The concentration of protein in the hippocampal extracts was measured by BCA kit (30Bennecib M. Gong C.X. Wegiel J. Lee M.H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Alzheimers Rep. 2000; 3: 295-303Google Scholar) according to manufacturer's instruction (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—The phosphorylation of tau at various sites was determined by Western blots as described previously (31Bennecib M. Gong C.X. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Blots were developed with PS214 (1:1,000), Tau-1 (1:30,000), PHF-1 (1:500), or Tau-5 (1:200) antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (Pierce) and exposure to CL-XPosure film (Pierce). The immunoreactivity of tau bands was quantitatively analyzed by Kodak Digital Science 1D software (Eastman Kodak Co., New Haven, CT) and expressed as sum optical density. The levels of total tau and phosphorylated tau at various sites were expressed as relative level of the sum optical density against control. Protein Kinase Activity Assay—The GSK-3 activity in rat hippocampal extracts was measured using phospho-GS peptide 2 as described previously (32Pei J.J. Tanaka T. Tung Y.C. Braak E. Iqbal K.

Briefly, tissue extract, 7.5 μg of protein was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μm peptide substrate and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1500 cpm/pmol of ATP) in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 300 mmO-phosphoric acid. The reaction mixture was applied in triplicates on phosphocellulose paper (Pierce). The filters were washed three times with 75 mmO-phosphoric acid, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation counter. The GSK-3 activity was expressed as picomoles of phosphate incorporated/mg of protein/min at 30 °C. The PKA activity was measured using Kemptide as a substrate, as described previously (35Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue extract, 7.5 μg of protein was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 100 μm Kemptide, 5 μm cAMP, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1500 cpm/pmol of ATP) in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped, and the kinase activity was determined as described above for GSK-3 activity assay. The cdc2 kinase activity was measured using synthetic peptide (PKTPKKAKKL) corresponding to amino acids 9–18 of histone H1 (37Lew J. Beaudette K. Litwin C.M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13383-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue extract, 10 μg of protein was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 50 μm peptide substrate and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2000 cpm/pmol of ATP) in 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in a total volume of 25 μl. The reaction was stopped, and the kinase activity was determined as described above for GSK-3 activity assay. The MAPK activity was measured using synthetic peptide (APRTPGGRR) corresponding to amino acids 95–98 of bovine myelin basic protein (38Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C.

Briefly, tissue extract, 10 μg of protein was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with 250 μm peptide substrate in assay buffer: 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped, and the kinase activity was determined as described above for the GSK-3 activity assay. The cdk5 activity was measured using immunoprecipitation of cdk5 (30Bennecib M. Gong C.X. Wegiel J. Lee M.H. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Alzheimers Rep. 2000; 3: 295-303Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of protein was mixed with 2 μg of antibody to cdk5. After incubation at 4 °C overnight, 30 μl of immobilized protein G suspension was added to the reaction mixture, and it was constantly mixed for 2–4 h. The sedimented beads were suspended in 25-μl assay buffer: 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and reacted with 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped, and the kinase activity was determined as described above for GSK-3 activity assay. The levels of all protein kinase activities were expressed as relative to the enzymatic activity in control animals. Immunocytochemistry—Twenty-four hours after injection, rats were fixed in situ by perfusion for 20 min at 4 °C by Zamboni's solution containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 15% saturated picric acid, and 24 mm NaH2PO4/126 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2). The brain was removed from the skull of the fixed animals and sliced coronally into blocks that contained hippocampus. These tissue blocks were further fixed in the same Zamboni's solution for another 12 h at 4 °C, paraffin-embedded, and cut into 5-μm-thick sections. The immunocytochemical staining was performed as described previously (32Pei J.J. Tanaka T. Tung Y.C. Braak E. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 41Pei J.J. Braak E. Braak H. Grundke-Iqbal K. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 1010-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue sections were first treated with 100 mm NaOH at room temperature for 30 min, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 48 h with one of the following primary antibodies: PS214 (1:500), Tau-1 (1:30,000), or PHF-1 (1:500). The bound primary antibodies were detected using Histostain™-SP kits (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and visualized with diaminobenzidine (brown color). All sections were counterstained lightly with hematoxylin to show cell nuclei (blue). Animals and Morris Water Maze—Sprague-Dawley rats (Grade II, male, weight 200–250 g, 4 months old) were supplied by Experimental Animal Central of Tongji Medical College. Rats were allowed free access to food and water and maintained at constant temperature (25 °C). Spatial memory was measured by Morris water maze, according to classic Morris protocol (42Morris R J. Neurosci. Methods. 1984; 11: 47-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (5824) Google Scholar). This protocol enables the measurement of the acquisition and as well as the retention of the spatial memory. Rats tested in the water maze were extensively handled (2 min every day for 7 days). Before each experiment (2 h), the rats were brought to the site to allow them to be acclimatized. The rats were kept in cages on shelves in an outer room to eliminate directional olfactory and auditory cues. The temperature of the room and water was kept at 26 ± 2 °C. The water in the pool was made opaque with milk (1 kg of milk/m3 of water) to hide the escape platform. The Plexiglas platform was 40 cm high, 10 cm in diameter, and its surface was scarred to help the rats climb on it. The water surface was 18 cm from the rim of the pool, and the inner wall was always carefully wiped to eliminate any local cues. The rim of the pool was 1.0 m from the nearest visual cue of red and blue marks. For spatial learning, rats were trained by successive 20 trials with a 30-s interval (4 trials/day) in a water pool to find a platform hidden in milky water. On each trial, the rat started from one of the middle of the four quadrants facing the wall of the pool and ended when the animal climbed the platform. The rats were not allowed to search for the platform more than 60 s, after which they were guided to the platform. Through these training sessions, rats acquired spatial memory about location of the safe platform. These rats were then injected with test drugs or vehicle only (see below). After 24 h of drug injection the animals were retested for spatial memory retention in the Morris water maze. In this case, we removed the safe platform from the water pool and allowed rats to freely swim in the water pool for 60 s to assay the influence of various drug treatments on spatial memory retention. The time rats stayed in the previous platform quadrant (quadrant time) and the pathway of rats swimming were recorded by a video camera fixed to the ceiling of the room, 1.5 m from the water surface. The camera was connected to a digital-tracking device attached to an IBM computer loaded with the water maze software. The longer a rat stayed in the previous platform-located quadrant, the better it scored spatial memory. We expressed spatial memory of a rat as quadrant time (%). Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed using SPSS 10.0 statistical software. The one-way analysis of variance procedure followed by least significant difference post hoc tests was used to determine the statistical significance of differences of the means. To analyze the correlations among variables, Pearson correlations were computed with bivariate correlations procedure. Forskolin Induces tau Phosphorylation at Ser-214, Tau-1, and PHF-1 Sites in Vivo—To study the effect of PKA activation on tau phosphorylation in vivo, we injected different doses of forskolin, a specific PKA activator (43Adashi E.Y. Resnick C.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 31: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 44Laurenza A. Sutkowski E.M. Seamon K.B. Trends. Pharmacol. Sci. 1989; 10: 442-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), into left lateral ventricle of rats for 24 h. Changes in the phosphorylation of tau at several sites were then examined by Western blots using phosphorylation-dependent and site-specific tau antibodies. We found that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-214 in rat hippocampus increased to ∼4-, 7-, and 15-fold of the control level 24 h after injection of 20, 40, and 80 μm forskolin, respectively (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, under the same conditions we found that the phosphorylation of tau at Ser-396 and/or Ser-404 (PHF-1 site) increased to 1.4-, 2-, and 3-fold (Fig. 1B), and the level of tau where neither serines 198, 199, nor 202 are phosphorylated (Tau-1 site) was decreased to 77%, 50, and 38% of the control level (Fig. 1C), respectively. The total level of tau measured by Tau-5 was not changed significantly by forskolin treatment (Fig. 1D). We also studied the immunohistochemical distribution of tau phosphorylation induced by infusion of forskolin in the lateral ventricle. With antibodies PS214 (Fig. 2, A and B) and PHF-1 (Fig. 2, C and D), we observed a marked increase in the immunostaining of hippocampi of forskolin-treated animals as compared with that of vehicle-injected controls. The most dramatic increase in the staining was seen in the mossy fibers of CA3 sector. When stained with Tau-1, a decreased staining was observed in sections from forskolin-treated animals (Fig. 2, E and F). The topology of the change of staining with Tau-1 was similar to those of staining with PS214 and PHF-1. These results indicated that the infusion of forskolin induced phosphorylation of tau at various sites in the same region of the brain. The tau phosphorylation occurred most dramatically in the mossy fibers of CA3 sector of hippocampus. Forskolin Increases PKA but Not GSK-3, cdc2, cdk5, and MAPK Activities in Rat Hippocampus—To confirm the activation of PKA in situ in the hippocampus by injection of forskolin into the lateral ventricle, we measured PKA activity in the hippocampal extracts and found a dose-dependent activation of PKA (Fig. 3A). Up to 6-fold activation of PKA was observed when injected with 80 μm forskolin. The PKA activation was highly correlated to the phosphorylation of tau observed. This is evidenced by a positive correlation between PKA activity and immunoreactivities of PS214 (Fig. 3F) and PHF-1 (Fig. 3H), both of which recognize only the phosphorylated tau, and a negative correlation between PKA activity and immunoreactivity of Tau-1, which recognizes unphosphorylated tau (Fig. 3G). However, among the phosphorylation sites of tau studied above, only Ser"
https://openalex.org/W2039420692,"Abstract There are about 200–600 million betel quid (BQ) chewers in the world. BQ chewing is one of the major risk factor of hepatocarcinoma, oropharyngeal, and esophagus cancers in Taiwan, India, and Southeast Asian countries. Thus, the precise molecular mechanisms deserve investigation. We used cultured primary keratinocytes and KB cells, RT-PCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and ELISA to evaluate whether alterations in early gene expression is crucial in the carcinogenic processes of BQ. We observed the induction of c-Fos mRNA expression in human gingival keratinocyte (GK) and KB carcinoma cells by areca nut (AN) extract and arecoline. A maximal increment in c-fos gene expression was shown at about 30 min after challenge. AN extract (100–800 μg/ml) and arecoline (0.1–0.8 mm) also stimulated ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation with a maximal stimulation at 5–10 min of exposure. Pretreatment by U0126 (30 μm), a MEK inhibitor, markedly inhibited the c-Fos, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and IL-6 mRNA expression of the KB epithelial cells. In addition, U0126 and PD98059 (50 μm) also decreased AN extract- and arecoline-associated PGE2 and IL-6 production in GK and KB cells. However, U0126 by itself arrested the cells in G0/G1 phase, but was not able to prevent AN- and arecoline-induced cell death or apoptosis. In contrast, U0126 enhanced the AN-induced apoptosis of KB cells. AN ingredients thus play a significant role in the pathogenesis of oropharyngeal cancer by activation of MEK1/ERK/c-Fos pathway, which promotes keratinocyte inflammation, cell survival, and affects cell cycle progression."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a cause of serious lung infection in immunocompromised individuals and cystic fibrosis patients. The role of the TLR-MyD88 pathway in P. aeruginosa-induced lung infection in vivo was examined in this study. MyD88-/- mice demonstrated an impaired clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lung. Little or no neutrophil recruitment was observed in the airways of MyD88-/- mice following P. aeruginosa lung infection. This observation was associated with a reduced production of inflammatory mediators that affect neutrophil recruitment, including macrophage-inflammatory protein-2, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1β in the airways of MyD88-/- mice. Similarly, MyD88-/- mice showed inhibited NF-κB activation in the lung following P. aeruginosa infection. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa infection induced a 7.5-fold increase of TLR2 mRNA expression in the lungs of MyD88+/+ mice. Furthermore, host responses to P. aeruginosa lung infection in TLR2-/- and TLR4 mutant mice were partially inhibited compared with the responses of respective control mice. Taken together, our results indicate that the MyD88-dependent pathway is essential for the development of early host responses to P. aeruginosa infection, leading to the clearance of this bacterium, and that TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in this process.

Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). There are at least 10 TLRs (TLR1–TLR10) that induce signal transduction through adaptor proteins. Five TLR-associated adaptor proteins have been described previously (2Oshiumi H. Sasai M. Shida K. Fujita T. Matsumoto M. Seya T. J. Biol.

The adaptor usage by different TLRs provides a molecular basis for the differences in gene expression patterns induced by distinct TLRs (3O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Given that MyD88 transduces a core set of TLR-induced signals (1Barton G.M. Medzhitov R.

Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), microbially induced immune responses can be divided broadly into the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway is essential for the host defense against microbial infections in vivo from organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (4Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) and Toxoplasma gondii (5Scanga C.A. Aliberti J. Jankovic D. Tilloy F. Bennouna S. Denkers E.Y. Medzhitov R. Sher A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5997-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In contrast, resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is effected largely through MyD88-independent pathways (6Shi S. Nathan C. Schnappinger D. Drenkow J. Fuortes M. Block E. Ding A.

In other cases, both MyD88-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved. For example, Listeria monocytogenes activates an immune response through an ordered, sequential MyD88-independent and -dependent fashion (9Serbina N.V. Kuziel W. Flavell R. Akira S. Rollins B. Pamer E.G. Immunity. 2003; 19: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Specific microbes utilize individual TLR and adaptor pathways to induce immune responses that are tailored to the given microbial infection (10Pulendran B. Palucka K. Banchereau J. Science. 2001; 293: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic Gram-negative bacillus, is the major pathogen in cystic fibrosis patients (11Koch C. Hoiby N. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1065-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and a common cause of nosocomial pneumonia (12Cross A. Allen J.R. Burke J. Ducel G. Harris A. John J. Johnson D.

Two major features of P. aeruginosa lung infection are the recruitment of neutrophils and the production of various cytokines and chemokines in the local tissue (14Greenberger P.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1997; 278: 1924-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils play an essential role in the clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lung (15Cripps A.W. Dunkley M.L. Clancy R.L. Kyd J. Immunol.

Recruitment of neutrophils to the lung is largely induced by the production of inflammatory mediators in the airways (17Wagner J.G. Roth R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 349-374PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa-induced mediator production in the airways is initiated by the interaction between P. aeruginosa and the host cell receptors (15Cripps A.W. Dunkley M.L. Clancy R.L. Kyd J. Immunol.

Several cell surface molecules have been implicated in the direct interaction with P. aeruginosa, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (18Pier G.B. Grout M. Zaidi T.S.

Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In vitro, TLR2 and TLR5 are involved in P. aeruginosa flagella-induced activation of epithelial cells (24Adamo R. Sokol S. Soong G. Gomez M. Prince A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in monocyte and macrophage activation by a component of P. aeruginosa alginate (26Flo T.H. Ryan L. Latz E. Takeuchi O. Monks B.G. Lien E. Halaas O. Akira S. Skjak-Braek G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35489-35495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of the TLR-MyD88 pathway to the effective host response to P. aeruginosa lung infection remains a critical area of investigation. Here we demonstrate that MyD88-deficient (MyD88-/-) mice showed little or no neutrophil recruitment or production of the neutrophil attractants MIP-2, TNF, and IL-1β and had an impaired ability to clear P. aeruginosa from the lung, which vastly contrasted with the findings of robust MIP-2, TNF, and IL-1β production, neutrophil infiltration, and bacterial clearance demonstrated in wild type animals. These findings suggest an essential role for the MyD88-dependent pathway in the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection in vivo. The different immune responses seen in MyD88-/-, TLR2-/-, and TLR4 mutant mice suggest that the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection may involve multiple members of the MyD88-dependent TLR/IL-1 superfamily. Mice—MyD88-/- mice backcrossed eight times to the C57BL/6 background and TLR2-deficient mice (TLR2-/-, C57BL/6 background) were kindly provided by Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) (28Adachi O. Kawai T. Takeda K. Matsumoto M. Tsutsui H. Sakagami M. Nakanishi K. Akira S. Immunity. 1998; 9: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River (Wilmington, MA). MyD88-/- mice were matched with C57BL/6 mice for age and sex. C3H/HeJ mice (TLR4 mutant) and control, C3H/HeOuJ, (TLR4+/+) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The protocols were approved by the University Committee on Laboratory Animals, Dalhousie University, in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Lung Infection with P. aeruginosa and Collection of Lung and Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid—P. aeruginosa strain 8821 (a gift from Dr. A. Chakrabarty, University of Illinois, Chicago) is a mucoid strain isolated from a cystic fibrosis patient (29Kamath S. Kapatral V. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mice were infected intranasally with 1 × 107 or 1 × 109 CFU of P. aeruginosa. After 4, 8, or 24 h, mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture, and phosphate buffer solution was infused into the heart to remove blood from the lungs. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained by laving the lung three times with 1 ml of phosphate buffer solution containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml). Lung tissue was obtained for the detection of cytokines and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, for bacterial CFU counting (left lobes), and for histology, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis (right lobes). Lung tissue was homogenized in 50 mm HEPES buffer (4 μl/mg lung tissue) containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 μg/ml). For counting bacterial CFU, 10 μl of the homogenate was plated on an agar dish and incubated for 24–48 h at 37 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was stored at -80 °C for later analysis of cytokines. The pellet was resuspended and homogenized in 0.5% cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (4 μl/mg lung tissue) and centrifuged as above. The clear extract was used for the MPO assay. BALF (10 μl) was plated on an agar dish and incubated for 24–48 h, and then bacterial CFU were counted. For the detection of cytokines and MPO activity, BALF was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for cytokine analysis. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of NH4Cl (0.15 m) and spun as before to lyse red blood cells. The supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in 0.5% cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (250 μl/mouse) and centrifuged, and the clear extracts were used for MPO assay. MPO Assay—The MPO assay was used to determine the infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs of the mice as described previously (30Schneider T. Issekutz A.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 198: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples in duplicate (75 μl) were mixed with equal volumes of the substrate (3 mm 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride, 120 μm Resorcinol, and 2.2 mm H2O2,) for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of 2 m H2SO4. The optical density was measured at 450 nm. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a 7000 Sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total RNA was isolated from the lung tissue and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II (Invitrogen). Specific quantitative assays for MIP-2, IL-12, TLR2, and TLR4 were performed using Assays-on-Demand™ reagents containing 6-FAM dye-labeled TaqMan® minor groove binder probes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol (31Heid C.A. Stevens J. Livak K.J. Williams P.M. Genome Res. 1996; 6: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (5002) Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous reference. Data were analyzed using a relative standard curve method according to the manufacturer's protocol, and values from wild type untreated mice were used as the calibrator. Thus, data are expressed as the -fold increase relative to wild type untreated mice. Cytokine Production—The concentrations of IL-1β, TNF, MIP-2, IL-12, Ifn-γ in the lung, and BALF were determined by ELISA. IL-1β, TNF, MIP-2, IL-12, and Ifn-γ levels were measured as described previously (32Lin T.J. Garduno R. Boudreau R.T. Issekutz A.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4522-4530Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) using antibody pairs from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—A consensus double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide (Promega, Madison, WI) (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′) was used for the electrophoretic mobility assay. Probe labeling was accomplished by treatment with T4 kinase (Promega) in the presence of [32P]adenosine triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences). Labeled oligonucleotides were purified on a Sephadex G-25M column (Amersham Biosciences). 10 μg of nuclear protein was added to a 10-μl volume of binding reaction with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Labeled double-stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide was added to each reaction mixture, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer. Gels were vacuum-dried and subjected to autoradiography. Cold competition was carried out by adding 1 μl (1.75 μm) of specific unlabeled double-stranded probe to the reaction mixture. Unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (1 μl, 1.75 μm) that does not bind NF-κB was used for nonspecific competition (data not shown). Polyclonal antibodies to p50 and p65 (1 μg/10 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for supershift assays for NF-κB proteins (data not shown). Histology—Mice lungs were fixed in 10% formalin overnight and then in 100% ethanol for paraffin embedding and sectioning. Slides were deparaffinized with Citrisolv (Fisher) and rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Slides were stained with Harris hematoxylin-eosin to illustrate lung histology. Statistics—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. of the indicated number of experiments. Statistical significance was determined by assessing means with analysis of variance and the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test or by using an unpaired t test. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Impaired Clearance of P. aeruginosa in MyD88-/-Mice—We used MyD88-deficient mice to examine the role of MyD88 in the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection in vivo. MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice were inoculated intranasally with 1 × 109 CFU of P. aeruginosa strain 8821. BALF and lung tissue were collected 24 h later for the detection of viable bacteria by counting CFU. MyD88+/+ mice are able to clear P. aeruginosa (Fig. 1). Significantly higher CFU counts can be seen in both the BALF and lung tissue from MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 1), suggesting that MyD88-/- mice demonstrate impaired bacterial clearance in comparison with MyD88+/+ mice. Impaired Neutrophil Recruitment to the Lung in MyD88-/-Mice—Given that neutrophils are essential for the clearance of P. aeruginosa during acute lung infection (15Cripps A.W. Dunkley M.L. Clancy R.L. Kyd J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 418-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether the impaired bacterial clearance in MyD88-/- mice was caused by defective neutrophil infiltration. MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice were inoculated intranasally with P. aeruginosa strain 8821. After 4 or 8 h, the BALF and lung tissue were collected for measuring MPO activities. In MyD88+/+ mice, infection with P. aeruginosa for 4 h induced an increased activity of MPO in the lung but not in the BALF, suggesting that at this time point neutrophils in circulation were recruited to the lung but had not yet reached the airways. After 8 h of infection, a significant increase of MPO activities was observed in both BALF and lung tissue in MyD88+/+ mice (Fig. 2, a and b). Strikingly, little change in MPO activity was observed in either BALF or lung tissue after 4 or 8 h of P. aeruginosa lung infection in the MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 2, a and b), suggesting an impaired neutrophil recruitment to the lung in MyD88-/- mice. This finding is confirmed by histological examination of the lung. Lung tissue from MyD88-/- mice showed little neutrophil infiltration after 8 h of P. aeruginosa infection, compared with the prominent neutrophil recruitment in MyD88+/+ mice (Fig. 2, c–f). P. aeruginosa-induced Production of MIP-2, TNF, and IL-1β in MyD88+/+but Not in MyD88-/-Mice—MyD88-/- neutrophils have normal migration ability in vivo because neutrophil recruitment to the septic focus has been shown to be normal in MyD88-/- mice during polymicrobial infection (8Weighardt H. Kaiser-Moore S. Vabulas R.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Holzmann B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that the impaired neutrophil recruitment in the lungs of MyD88-deficient mice might be caused by a defect in the production of neutrophil chemoattractants. Accordingly, several cytokines and chemokines that are important for neutrophil migration in vivo were examined. These include the direct neutrophil chemoattractant MIP-2 (33Hashimoto S. Pittet J.F. Hong K. Folkesson H. Bagby G. Kobzik L. Frevert C. Watanabe K. Tsurufuji S. Wiener-Kronish J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L819-L828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kernacki K.A. Barrett R.P. Hobden J.A. Hazlett L.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and indirect attractants TNF and IL-1β (17Wagner J.G. Roth R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 349-374PubMed Google Scholar). To examine MIP-2 mRNA expression by real-time RT-PCR, lung tissue from MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice after 4 h of P. aeruginosa infection was used to isolate RNA. A significant increase of MIP-2 mRNA expression was seen in MyD88+/+ mice. In contrast, there was little MIP-2 response in MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 3a). To determine MIP-2 production at the protein level, BALF and lung tissue homogenates from MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice after 4 or 8 h of P. aeruginosa lung infection were used to determine MIP-2 protein concentration by ELISA. P. aeruginosa infection induced a significant increase of MIP-2 in the BALF and lung tissue in MyD88+/+ mice. In contrast, there was little MIP-2 production in MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 3, b and c). Levels of TNF and IL-1β were also examined because of their essential roles in neutrophil recruitment to the lung in vivo (17Wagner J.G. Roth R.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 349-374PubMed Google Scholar). In MyD88+/+ mice, P. aeruginosa lung infection induced an increased production of IL-1β in the lung tissue (Fig. 4b) and TNF in the BALF (Fig. 4c). In contrast, there was little response of IL-1β or TNF in lung tissue or BALF from MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 4, b and c). It is also noteworthy that in wild type mice, P. aeruginosa-induced IL-1β remained largely in the lung tissue (Fig. 4b), whereas the majority of TNF was secreted in the BALF (Fig. 4c). Given that Ifn-γ and IL-12 have been implicated in P. aeruginosa lung infection (35Moser C. Jensen P.O. Kobayashi O. Hougen H.P. Song Z. Rygaard J. Kharazmi A. Hoiby N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 127: 206-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 36Yamaguchi T. Hirakata Y. Izumikawa K. Miyazaki Y. Maesaki S. Tomono K. Yamada Y. Kohno S. Kamihira S. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 49: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), these two cytokines were examined in both MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice. Mice were challenged for 4 or 8 h with an intranasal inoculation of P. aeruginosa (strain 8821, 1 × 107 CFU/mouse). The BALF and lung tissue homogenates were used to determine the levels of production of Ifn-γ and IL-12 by ELISA. In contrast to the robust response of neutrophil attractants MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF, there was little Ifn-γ and IL-12 response in both MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice after 4 or 8 h of P. aeruginosa lung infection (data not shown). To examine the role of MyD88 in P. aeruginosa-induced NF-κB activation, lung tissue homogenates from P. aeruginosa-infected (4 h) or untreated mice were used to isolate nuclear extracts for the determination of NF-κB activation by electrophoretic mobility assay. P. aeruginosa-induced NF-κB activation was seen in wild type mice (Fig. 5). In contrast, P. aeruginosa-induced NF-κB activation was markedly reduced in MyD88-/- mice. These data are consistent with the defect of P. aeruginosa-induced mediator production in MyD88-/- mice as shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Increased TLR2, but Not TLR4, mRNA Expression in the Lung after P. aeruginosa Stimulation—Because MyD88 is important in TLR signaling, the lack of a P. aeruginosa-induced response in MyD88-/- mice suggests that TLR may have a critical role in P. aeruginosa-induced host responses. To examine whether P. aeruginosa infection induces changes in TLR2 and TLR4 expression, lung tissue from P. aeruginosa-infected (4 h) MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice was used to determine mRNA levels by real-time RT-PCR. Results were expressed as the -fold increase relative to the level in wild type untreated mice by using the average value from these animals as a calibrator. As shown in Fig. 6a, the basal levels of TLR2 expression in MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice were similar. Interestingly, P. aeruginosa infection induced a greater increase in TLR2 expression in MyD88+/+ mice (7.5-fold) than in MyD88-/- mice (1.7-fold) (Fig. 6a), supporting the concept that TLR2 is involved in P. aeruginosa lung infection. However, little change in TLR4 level in the lung was found in MyD88+/+ and MyD88-/- mice (Fig. 6b). To examine whether TLR4 plays a role in P. aeruginosa-induced up-regulation of TLR2 expression, TLR4 mutant mice were used. Lung tissue from saline-treated or P. aeruginosa-infected (4 h) mice was subjected to real-time RT-PCR analysis for TLR2 mRNA. Data are expressed as the -fold increase relative to the level in saline-treated mice. As shown in Fig. 6a, P. aeruginosa infection had little effect on TLR2 expression, suggesting an important role for TLR4 in P. aeruginosa-induced TLR2 expression. P. aeruginosa-induced Differential Responses in TLR2-/-and TLR4 Mutant Mice—To determine the specific contributions of TLR2 and TLR4 in the development of early immune responses in the lung following P. aeruginosa infection, TLR2-/- and TLR4 mutant mice as well as their corresponding control mice were infected intranasally with P. aeruginosa strain 8821 for 4 h. Lung homogenates were used to determine neutrophil infiltration (MPO) and cytokine production. TLR2-/- mice showed a partial decrease in neutrophil recruitment compared with wild type mice (Fig. 7a). However, a significant P. aeruginosa-induced MIP-2 and IL-1β production was observed in TLR2-/- mice (Fig. 7, b–d), suggesting that TLR2 alone may not be a major component in mediating P. aeruginosa-induced responses. Similarly, TLR4 mutant mice showed P. aeruginosa-induced production of MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF when compared with saline-treated mice (Fig. 7, f–h). Compared with TLR4+/+ mice, TLR4 mutant mice demonstrated a significant decrease of neutrophil recruitment and MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF production (Fig. 7, e–h). Depending on the nature of the microbial infection, the mechanism of the host defense varies, including variations in the receptor usage, signaling pathways, cellular participants, and the pattern of gene expression (10Pulendran B. Palucka K. Banchereau J. Science. 2001; 293: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 15Cripps A.W. Dunkley M.L. Clancy R.L. Kyd J. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 418-424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection in vivo remain incompletely defined. The lung has a unique relationship with the environment and has developed distinct strategies to defend itself from microbial invasion with innate immune mechanisms that are primarily responsible for the elimination of bacterial organisms (37Strieter R.M. Belperio J.A. Keane M.P. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2003; 16: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Zhang P. Summer W.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa, which generates a mucoid phenotype after colonizing lung tissue, appears to have a specialized relationship with the lung (39Govan J.R. Deretic V. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 539-574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa-induced lung damage is the major cause of death in cystic fibrosis patients (11Koch C. Hoiby N. Lancet. 1993; 341: 1065-1069Abstract PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and accounts for 40% of the cause of deaths in people with ventilator-associated pneumonia (13Crouch Brewer S. Wunderink R.G. Jones C.B. Leeper Jr., K.V. Chest. 1996; 109: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We attempted to determine the role of the TLR-MyD88 pathway in the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection. Consistent with a recent finding (40Skerrett S.J. Liggitt H.D. Hajjar A.M. Wilson C.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), our results suggest that the MyD88-dependent pathway is a central component of the initiation of P. aeruginosa-induced early immune responses in the lung, leading to the clearance of this bacterium. Because neutrophils play a major role in the clearance of P. aeruginosa from the lung, the defective clearance of P. aeruginosa seen in MyD88-/- mice is likely caused by a deficient recruitment of neutrophils into the airways. Given that MyD88-/- neutrophils appear to have a normal migratory ability (8Weighardt H. Kaiser-Moore S. Vabulas R.M. Kirschning C.J. Wagner H. Holzmann B. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2823-2827Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the defective influx of neutrophils into the airways is most likely the result of insufficient production of neutrophil attractants in the lung of MyD88-/- mice as observed in this study. Accordingly, our results support the model in which, during acute P. aeruginosa lung infection, MyD88 is absolutely required for the early production of the cytokines and chemokines MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF, which are responsible for neutrophil recruitment and subsequent bacterial clearance. However, this does not exclude the possibility of the involvement of MyD88-independent pathways such as the TRIF/TRAM pathway in the P. aeruginosa-induced host response, especially in the later phase of the infection. Several Ifn-regulatory factor (IRF) 3-regulated cytokines and chemokines such as RANTES and Ifn-α inducible protein 10 are induced by the TRIF/TRAM pathway in response to bacterial LPS stimulation (41Vogel S.N. Fitzgerald K.A. Fenton M.J. Mol. Interv. 2003; 3: 466-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 42Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). RANTES and Ifn-α inducible protein 10 are up-regulated during P. aeruginosa infection (43Kernacki K.A. Goebel D.J. Poosch M.S. Hazlett L.D. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the role for the TRIF/TRAM pathway in P. aeruginosa-induced lung infection requires further study. Given the importance of MyD88 in TLR signaling (1Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar) and the circumstantial evidence of the association between P. aeruginosa and TLR2 or TLR4 (24Adamo R. Sokol S. Soong G. Gomez M. Prince A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Roger T. David J. Glauser M.P. Calandra T. Nature. 2001; 414: 920-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 26Flo T.H. Ryan L. Latz E. Takeuchi O. Monks B.G. Lien E. Halaas O. Akira S. Skjak-Braek G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35489-35495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), immune responses to P. aeruginosa infection were examined in MyD88-/-, TLR2-/-, and TLR4 mutant mice, with the goal of assessing the relative contribution of these molecules as well as additional TLRs in P. aeruginosa infection. Apparently, the pattern of P. aeruginosa-induced immune responses in TLR2-/- or TLR4 mutant mice is different from that seen in MyD88-/- mice. These results suggest that neither TLR2 nor TLR4 functions individually as the only component responsible for P. aeruginosainduced immune response in the lung in vivo. This difference suggests that additional TLRs, such as TLR5 (24Adamo R. Sokol S. Soong G. Gomez M. Prince A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 44Zhang J. Xu K. Ambati B. Yu F.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), or synergistic effects between different TLRs (45Sato S. Nomura F. Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Muhlradt P.F. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7096-7101Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) may be involved. Nevertheless, the increase of TLR2 expression in the lung after P. aeruginosa infection and the partial inhibition of immune responses in TLR2-/- mice support a role for TLR2 in P. aeruginosa-induced lung inflammation. This is consistent with recent in vitro studies (46Soong G. Reddy B. Sokol S. Adamo R. Prince A. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) demonstrating that TLR2 is involved in the activation of macrophages and monocytes by mannuronic acid polymers, a component of P. aeruginosa alginate that is specifically related to the mucoid phenotype (26Flo T.H. Ryan L. Latz E. Takeuchi O. Monks B.G. Lien E. Halaas O. Akira S. Skjak-Braek G. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35489-35495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TLR2 is mobilized into an apical lipid raft receptor complex in epithelial cells after P. aeruginosa stimulation. In addition, TLR2 together with TLR5 and gangliotetraosylceramide have been shown to be involved in P. aeruginosa flagella-induced epithelial cell activation in vitro (24Adamo R. Sokol S. Soong G.

Although the level of TLR4 mRNA was not changed, the inhibition of P. aeruginosa-induced neutrophil infiltration and production of MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF in TLR4 mutant mice supports a role for TLR4 in P. aeruginosa lung infection. However, unlike the nearly complete inhibition in MyD88-/- mice, a significant P. aeruginosa-induced production of MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF was observed in TLR4 mutant mice. Other studies (47Lieberman M.M. Ayala E. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1-3PubMed Google Scholar, 48George S.E. Kohan M.J. Gilmour M.I. Taylor M.S. Brooks H.G. Creason J.P. Claxton L.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3585-3591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated P. aeruginosa-induced immune responses in C3H/HeJ mice. Thus, other TLRs in addition to TLR4 or synergistic effects between TLRs may be involved in host responses to P. aeruginosa lung infection. The increase in TLR2 mRNA expression and the unchanged TLR4 mRNA level in P. aeruginosa-infected lungs suggest that TLR2 and TLR4 may have different roles during P. aeruginosa infection. It is likely that the contribution of TLR2 may increase when the infection progresses, considering the 7.5-fold increase of TLR2 mRNA in the lungs of P. aeruginosa-infected wild type mice. The P. aeruginosa-induced increase of TLR2 mRNA was not observed in TLR4 mutant mice. This suggests that P. aeruginosa up-regulates TLR2 through activation of TLR4. It is widely recognized that TLR4 is associated with LPS-induced tolerance before exposure to bacterial LPS, leading to a state of hyporesponsiveness to subsequent LPS stimulation (49Medvedev A.E. Kopydlowski K.M. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5564-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that TLR4 plays a major role during the early phase of P. aeruginosa infection, whereas TLR2 may play a greater role as the infection progresses. It has been well established that MyD88 transduces cell surface signals to transcription factor NF-κB, which regulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression, including TNF and IL-1β (1Barton G.M. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 300: 1524-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa-induced NF-κB activation has been reported previously (50DiMango E. Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Tabibi S. Prince A. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 2598-2605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was confirmed in our study in the infected lung tissue using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The defective production of TNF and IL-1β in MyD88-/- mice is likely caused by the blockade of signaling from TLRs to NF-κB in these animals, because P. aeruginosa-induced NF-κB activation in the lung was markedly reduced in MyD88-/- mice. Interestingly, unlike RANTES and Ifn-α inducible protein 10, which can be regulated in a MyD88-NF-κB-independent manner (42Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), MyD88-/- mice showed an almost complete deficiency in MIP-2 expression of both mRNA and protein levels. RANTES and Ifn-α inducible protein 10 contain IRF binding sites in their promoters and are regulated through the TRIF-IRF3/7 pathway during TLR activation (42Fitzgerald K.A. Rowe D.C. Barnes B.J. Caffrey D.R. Visintin A. Latz E. Monks B. Pitha P.M. Golenbock D.T. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1043-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 51Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no report regarding the existence of an IRF-binding site in the MIP-2 promoter. Although the MIP-2 promoter contains a conserved NF-κB consensus motif (52Widmer U. Manogue K.R. Cerami A. Sherry B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4996-5012PubMed Google Scholar), TLR-mediated MIP-2 production appears to be NF-κB-independent because the NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate blocks LPS-induced TNF and IL-1β production but has no effect on MIP-2 expression (53Ojaniemi M. Glumoff V. Harju K. Liljeroos M. Vuori K. Hallman M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, MyD88 may regulate MIP-2 production through additional transcription factors rather than through NF-κB. Alternatively, MyD88-dependent MIP-2 production may be secondary to the production of TNF and IL-1β because IL-1β and TNF are able to regulate MIP-2 expression (54Rudner X.L. Kernacki K.A. Barrett R.P. Hazlett L.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6576-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 55Ramesh G. Reeves W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F610-F618Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, the role for MyD88 in the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection is likely to rely on the interplay of multiple P. aeruginosa-induced mediators in the lung, such as MIP-2, TNF, and IL-1β. In summary, our results suggest that the MyD88-dependent pathway plays an essential role in P. aeruginosa-induced early immune responses, including MIP-2, IL-1β, and TNF production and subsequent neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance. Multiple MyD88-dependent TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4, may be involved in the host defense against P. aeruginosa lung infection.

Hypoxia caused p53-dependent apoptosis in murine embryonic fibroblasts transfected with Ras and E1A. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) but not other antioxidants, such as the vitamin E analog trolox and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, enhanced hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis. NAC also enhanced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in two human cancer cell lines, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells and A549 lung carcinoma cells. In murine embryonic fibroblasts, all three antioxidants blocked hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species formation. NAC did not enhance hypoxia-induced cytochrome c release but did enhance poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase cleavage, indicating that NAC acted at a post-mitochondrial level. NAC-mediated enhancement of apoptosis was mimicked by incubating cells with GSH monoester, which increased intracellular GSH similarly to NAC. Hypoxia promoted degradation of an inhibitor of κB(IκBα), NFκB-p65 translocation into the nucleus, NFκB binding to DNA, and subsequent transactivation of NFκB, which increased X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein levels. NAC failed to block degradation by IκBα and sequestration of the p65 subunit of NFκB to the nucleus. However, NAC did abrogate hypoxia-induced NFκB binding to DNA, NFκB-dependent gene expression, and induction of X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. In conclusion, NAC enhanced hypoxic apoptosis by a mechanism apparently involving GSH-dependent suppression of NFκB transactivation.

In conclusion, NAC enhanced hypoxic apoptosis by a mechanism apparently involving GSH-dependent suppression of NFκB transactivation. Hypoxia is a frequent feature of rapidly growing malignant tumors and their metastases. Tissue hypoxia resulting from inadequate blood supply generally occurs at early stages of tumor development, beginning at a tumor diameter of only a few millimeters (1Helmlinger G. Yuan F. Dellian M. Jain R.K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). In solid tumors, hypoxia causes a selection of mutations that makes cells resistant to apoptosis and less responsive to cancer therapy (2Schmaltz C. Hardenbergh P.H. Wells A. Fisher D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2845-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 3Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). Hypoxia also induces genes that protect cells against apoptosis. One of these genes is nuclear factor-κB (NFκB). 1The abbreviations used are: NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of nuclear factor κB; IKK, IκB kinase; c-FLIP, caspase-8-FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein; XIAP, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; d-NAC, N-acetyl-d-cysteine; GSH, reduced glutathione; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; PARP, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; CM-H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; DTT, dithiothreitol; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.1The abbreviations used are: NFκB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of nuclear factor κB; IKK, IκB kinase; c-FLIP, caspase-8-FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein; XIAP, X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; d-NAC, N-acetyl-d-cysteine; GSH, reduced glutathione; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; PARP, poly(ADP ribose) polymerase; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; CM-H2DCFDA, 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate; DCF, dichlorofluorescein; EGCG, epigallocatechin-3-gallate; DTT, dithiothreitol; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. NFκB is a critical transcription factor that tips the balance from apoptosis of cells to proliferation and malignant growth of tumor cells. NFκB belongs to the Re1 family, which includes five mammalian Re1/NFκB proteins: Re1A (p65), c-Re1, Re1B, NFκB1 (p50/p105), and NFκB2 (p52/p100) (4Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar). The activity of NFκB is regulated by movement between the cytoplasm and nucleus in response to cell stimulation (5Greten F.R. Karin M. Cancer Lett. 2004; 206: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). NFκB dimers containing Re1A or c-Re1 are retained in the cytoplasm through interaction with inhibitor of κB(IκB) repressor proteins (IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, and IκBϵ) (6Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Potent NFκB activators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, and lipopolysaccharide, cause IκB kinase (IKK)-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα on serine 32 and serine 36 residues, followed by ubiquitination at the nearby lysine residues and proteasomal degradation (7Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). This modification of IκBα exposes the nuclear localization signal of NFκB and leads to NFκB translocation to the nucleus, presumably as a consequence of binding to karyopherins (8Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 1999: RE1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), proteins responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport in cells. An alternative, less-characterized pathway of NFκB activation is by tyrosine 42 phosphorylation of IκBα after hypoxia/reoxygenation or pervanadate treatment (6Fan C. Li Q. Ross D. Engelhardt J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2072-2080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, in T-cells and bone marrow macrophages, tyrosine phosphorylation of IκBα is insufficient to activate NFκB, suggesting that tyrosine and serine kinases act at multiple levels to dissociate the IκBα/NFκB complex (8Rothwarf D.M. Karin M. Sci. STKE. 1999; 1999: RE1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once IκBα is inactivated, NFκB dimers are free to localize to the nucleus, where they undergo further modification, mostly through phosphorylation of the Re1 proteins (9Sizemore N. Lerner N. Dombrowski N. Sakurai H. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3863-3869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Activated NFκB in the nucleus binds to promoters of its target genes to initiate the transcription of several genes involved in immune responses, inflammation, viral infection, and cell survival (7Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Bose S. Kar N. Maitra R. DiDonato J.A. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10890-10895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NFκB suppresses apoptosis by inducing expression of various anti-apoptotic genes, including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, hematopoietic-specific Bcl-2 homolog A1 (Bfl1) (11Wang C.Y. Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5923-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), caspase-8-FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis (c-IAPs) (7Lin A. Karin M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2003; 13: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). NFκB also regulates X chromosome-linked IAP (XIAP/hILP), which inhibits caspase-3 and caspase-7 and prevents activation of pro-caspase-9 (12Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Hypoxia promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in a number of cell types (13Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Kulisz A. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2004; 97: 1358-1366Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). ROS, such as H2O2, may act as second messengers activating NFκB (16Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Hyperoxia, which also induces ROS generation, causes nuclear translocation and activation of NFκB (17Cazals V. Nabeyrat E. Corroyer S. de Keyzer Y. Clement A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Conversely, increased cellular antioxidants prevent NFκB activation by cytokines (18Renard P. Zachary M.D. Bougelet C. Mirault M.E. Haegeman G. Remacle J. Raes M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although substantial evidence supports a role of ROS in NFκB activation, the contribution of redox regulation to NFκB activation is still controversial (19Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a widely used thiol-containing antioxidant that is a precursor of reduced glutathione (GSH). GSH scavenges ROS in cells by interacting with OH· and H2O2, thus affecting ROS-mediated signaling pathways. NAC facilitates interleukin-1β-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase expression through an oxidation/reduction-related mechanism potentiating cytokine activation of the p44/42 MAPK signaling cascade (20Jiang B. Brecher P. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Kamata H. Manabe T. Kakuta J. Oka S. Hirata H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NAC inhibits activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 MAPK, redox-sensitive activator protein-1, and NFκB transcription factor activities regulating the expression of numerous genes (21Kamata H. Manabe T. Kakuta J. Oka S. Hirata H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 419-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Zafarullah M. Li W.Q. Sylvester J. Ahmad M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Although several reports show that NAC protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death (23Park S.A. Choi K.S. Bang J.H. Huh K. Kim S.U. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24van Zandwijk N. Chest. 1995; 107: 1437-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), other reports document that NAC can also induce apoptosis in colon carcinoma cells by increasing the pro-apoptotic Bax gene expression and by enhancing the susceptibility to the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (22Zafarullah M. Li W.Q. Sylvester J. Ahmad M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Despite evidence that ROS play a role in hypoxia-induced apoptosis, the exact mechanisms of apoptotic death are not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish causal links between GSH, NFκB activation, and cell survival in hypoxic transformed cells. We show that (i) NAC potentiates apoptosis of hypoxic transformed cells, and (ii) NAC inhibits NFκB-dependent expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as XIAP. Chemicals and Reagents—Monoclonal anti-NFκB p65, polyclonal anti-IκBα, anti-actin, anti-c-FLIP, and secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Bcl-xL antibody was from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal antibodies against poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), cytochrome c, F1α-ATPase, XIAP, and Bcl-2 were purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD), PharMingen (San Diego, CA), Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), and BD Transduction Labs (San Jose, CA), respectively. Hoescht 33342 and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes. α-Methylomuralide was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The luciferase reporter construct pNFκB-Luc was a gift from Dr. Santanu Bose (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH), and N-acetyl-d-cysteine (d-NAC) was a gift from Dr. Ian Cotgreave (AstraZeneca, Stockholm, Sweden). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—p53+/+ and p53-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transformed with proto-oncogenes Ras and E1A were kindly provided by Dr. Scott Lowe (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). MEFs, MIA PaCa-2 human pancreatic cancer cells, and A549 human lung carcinoma cells were grown in complete culture medium containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. MEFs were cultured on Primaria Petri dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). MIA PaCa-2 and A549 cells were cultured on Petri dishes without gelatin coating. For all experiments, cells were grown to 60–70% confluence. Hypoxia Experiments—MEFs, MIA PaCa-2, and A549 cells were cultured on 60-mm Petri dishes (1 × 106 cells/dish) before exposure to hypoxia. Subsequently, cells were preincubated with NAC for 1 h in complete culture medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose. Petri dishes were placed in hypoxic Plexiglass chambers (Billups-Rottenberg, Del Mar, CA) and sparged with 95% N2/5% CO2 at 2 psi for 4 min. The remaining final oxygen content was estimated to be ∼0.2% because of the presence of some residual oxygen. Chambers were then kept at 37 °C throughout the course of the experiment. Transfection and Reporter Assay—MEFs (1 × 106 cells/dish) were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of plasmid containing 2× NFκB promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene (10Bose S. Kar N. Maitra R. DiDonato J.A. Banerjee A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10890-10895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or 1 μg of empty vector luciferase construct using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). To normalize the transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with 4 μg of β-galactosidase control vector. Sixteen h after transfection, cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 4 h and then harvested. Relative luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Turner Design). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity, which was measured using a FluoReporter LacZ/β-galactosidase quantitation kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assessed as relative light units and used as an indicator of transcriptional induction of NFκB. Caspase-3 Activation—Caspase-3 activity was measured using a commercial kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, at the indicated time points, cultured MEFs were collected into a test tube, followed by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in a lysis buffer provided by the kit. Cell lysates were incubated with a caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate, DEVD-AFC (50 μm). Caspase-3 cleaves DEVD-AFC into free AFC, the fluorescence of which was measured with a CytoFluor 2000 fluorescence plate reader using 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission light. Caspase-3 enzymatic activity was expressed as pmol/mg/min AFC formed. ROS Formation—Cultured cells were loaded with 10 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA, Molecular Probes) for 1 h before exposure to hypoxia. Inside cells, esterases cleave the acetate esters to release free CM-H2DCF, which is non-fluorescent. After oxidation by ROS, CM-H2DCF is converted to green-fluorescing dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (25Nieminen A.L. Byrne A.M. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1286-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After hypoxia, medium containing CM-H2DCFDA was replaced, and cells were fixed and permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20% ethanol and 0.1% Tween 20. Subsequently, the cell extracts were centrifuged, and supernatants were collected. DCF fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence plate reader using 450-nm excitation and 530-nm emission filters. Measurement of GSH—GSH was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (Hewlett-Packard series 1050). MEFs were washed with PBS and lysed using two freeze-thaw cycles. Cells were then scraped, suspended in buffer containing 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and centrifuged. Supernatants were mixed with metaphosphoric acid to a final concentration of 1% to precipitate protein. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants were diluted (1:100) in a mobile phase containing 10 mm trichloroacetic acid and 69 mm monochloroacetic acid (pH adjusted to 2.72 with NaOH). GSH was resolved on a C18 reverse phase column (Vydac) and detected using electrochemical detection. A standard curve was generated using pure GSH, and results were calculated as nmol GSH/mg of protein (26Nulton-Persson A.C. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Szweda L.I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4235-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—At the indicated time points, total cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The lysates were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for total protein content (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Equivalent amounts of protein were diluted in sample buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, 15% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and resolved on SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were then transferred and immobilized onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was accomplished by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—At the indicated time points, MEFs cultured on gelatin-coated plastic coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After two washes with PBS, cells were incubated with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h, followed by primary monoclonal antibody against p65 NFκB (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse secondary Alexafluor 488 (1:200) and again washed three times with PBS. Hoechst 33342 (0.5 μg/ml) was included in the final wash to stain the nuclei. Coverslips were attached on slides, mounting medium (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) was added, and the preparation was covered with a glass coverslip. Images of Alexafluor 488 fluorescence were collected using 488-nm excitation and >505-nm emission filters. Hoeschst fluorescence was imaged with a 720-nm excitation light from a two-photon Mira 900 laser and >420-nm emission filter using a Zeiss 510 NLO laser scanning confocal microscope. Cytosolic, Mitochondrial, and Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared according to a modified method by Wang et al. (27Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on 150-mm Petri dishes were scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and washed with five packed cell volumes of buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mmN-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Cells were then resuspended in three to four packed cell volumes of buffer A and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were mixed with 0.5 volume of buffer B (75 mm Tris-Cl, 20% v/v glycerol, 300 mm KCl, and 600 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain the soluble cytoplasmic fraction (S-100). Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in buffer C (420 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, 20% v/v glycerol, and 1.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5), tubes were nutated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants were saved as nuclear extracts. Isolation of highly enriched mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was carried out using a commercial kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA) by following the manufacturer's protocol, with slight modifications (28Qanungo S. Haldar S. Basu A. Neoplasia. 2003; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NFκB Activation—NFκB activation was measured with a Trans-AM NFκB kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay, the oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) is immobilized onto a 96-well plate. Only the active form of NFκB in the cell extract specifically binds to this oligonucleotide. Epitopes on p50, p52, p65, c-Re1, and Re1B are accessible only when NFκB is bound to its target DNA. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were added to the wells, followed by the primary antibody against p65 and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The optical density was determined on an absorbance plate reader at 450 nm. Assessment of Cell Death—Apoptotic and necrotic cell death was assessed independently. At the indicated time points, floating cells were collected, and adherent cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS containing 200 μm digitonin (Calbiochem) and 50 μm propidium iodide (Molecular Probes). Digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane and allows propidium iodide to enter cells and stain all nuclei. Staining nuclei with propidium iodide in the presence of digitonin is analogous to staining nuclei with cell-permeable dyes such as 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic and counted using a 40× microscope objective and a rhodamine filter set. Necrotic cell death was assessed by incubating cells with trypan blue. Trypan blue enters cells and stains nuclei when the plasma membrane permeability barrier fails, a hallmark of necrosis (29Nieminen A.L. Gores G.J. Wray B.E. Tanaka Y. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Cell Calcium. 1988; 9: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Round, trypan blue-stained nuclei were counted as necrotic. At least 100 cells were counted from three different microscopic fields for each sample. Results were expressed as the percentage of all cells that were apoptotic or necrotic. Additionally, apoptotic cell death was assessed with a Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Endogenous endonucleases activated during apoptosis cleave double-stranded DNA to mono- and oligonucleosomes of 180-bp multiples, which the ELISA kit measures. DNA fragments were measured in the cytoplasmic fractions. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Differences were assessed by two-tailed paired Student's t test with Instat Software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. NAC Enhances Hypoxia-induced Apoptosis—NAC is a nontoxic precursor of GSH and has been reported to protect cells against oxidative stress (22Zafarullah M. Li W.Q. Sylvester J. Ahmad M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). We exposed p53+/+ MEFs to hypoxia for 12 h in the presence and absence of NAC. Hypoxia alone caused 12% apoptosis compared with 2% during normoxia, as assessed by nuclear morphology typical of apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Apoptotic cells showed fragmented nuclei when stained with propidium iodide in the presence of digitonin (Fig. 1A, inset). NAC enhanced hypoxia-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Apoptosis increased from 12% without NAC to 46% with 20 mm NAC (Fig. 1A). During normoxia, NAC increased apoptosis from 2.7% without NAC to 4.2% with 20 mm NAC (Fig. 1A). However, this increase of apoptosis was not dose-dependent. In contrast to p53+/+ MEFs, p53-/- MEFs were completely resistant to hypoxia and NAC (data not shown). In p53+/+ MEFs, NAC promoted hypoxia-induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Apoptosis increased from 1.6, 2.8, 5.7, and 12.0% without NAC to 1.9, 7.9, 19.5, and 46.0% with 20 mm NAC after 0, 4, 7, and 12 h of hypoxia, respectively (Fig. 1B). In the subsequent experiments, we chose 20 mm NAC to characterize the cellular and molecular targets of NAC. This concentration was chosen because it maximally promoted apoptosis during hypoxia (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Furthermore, previous studies show that 20 to 30 mm NAC inhibits ROS formation and NFκB activation in cancer cells (19Hayakawa M. Miyashita H. Sakamoto I. Kitagawa M. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. Karin M. Kikugawa K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3356-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 30Hammond E.M. Dorie M.J. Giaccia A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12207-12213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To further confirm that hypoxia-induced and hypoxia plus NAC-induced cell death was primarily apoptotic, histone-associated DNA fragments were measured in cytoplasmic fractions. Hypoxia alone increased DNA fragments 20% compared with normoxia, whereas hypoxia plus NAC increased DNA fragments by 260% compared with normoxia (Fig. 1C). During normoxia, however, NAC had no effect on DNA fragment formation. To assess necrotic cell death, MEFs were incubated with 0.2% trypan blue. Round nuclei stained with trypan blue were scored as necrotic. During normoxia, 11% of cells were necrotic (Fig. 1D). Hypoxia, hypoxia plus NAC, and NAC during normoxia did not increase necrosis significantly. The small percentage of necrosis observed in normoxic cells may be partly attributable to trypsinization before trypan blue staining and not related to experimental treatments. Together, our results indicate that cell death promoted by NAC was apoptotic. We also determined the effect of NAC on two human cancer cell lines. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia in the presence and absence of 20 mm NAC. NAC increased apoptosis from 9% without NAC to 30% with 20 mm NAC after 15 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1E). In A549 lung carcinoma cells, NAC increased apoptosis from 6% without NAC to 22% with 20 mm NAC after 26 h of hypoxia (Fig. 1F). NAC alone during normoxia caused a small increase of apoptosis in A549 cells but no increase in MIA PaCa-2 cells. NAC Does Not Accelerate Hypoxia-induced Cytochrome c Release—Next, we assessed whether NAC-enhanced apoptosis during hypoxia was mediated by accelerated cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol. After 12 h of exposure to hypoxia, a portion of cytochrome c was released from mitochondria to the cytosol (Fig. 2A). However, NAC did not change the extent of cytochrome c release, indicating that NAC-mediated enhancement of apoptosis acted downstream of mitochondria. Because NAC did not seem to enhance apoptosis through mitochondrial cytochrome c release, we determined whether post-mitochondrial events, such as PARP cleavage, were affected by NAC during hypoxia. PARP is a target for cysteine proteases, and 116-kDa PARP is frequently cleaved by caspase-3 into an 85-kDa fragment during apoptosis (31Qanungo S. Basu A. Das M. Haldar S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4149-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After 7 and 14 h of hypoxia alone, we could not detect the cleaved 85-kDa fragment of PARP by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). In contrast, hypoxia in combination with NAC produced the 85-kDa PARP-degraded product (Fig. 2B). Collectively, the results indicate that enhancement of hypoxia-induced apoptotic cell death by NAC was not mediated by increased cytochrome c release but rather through some other downstream effector molecules that resulted in PARP cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2156013775,"Ror2, a member of the mammalian Ror family of receptor tyrosine kinases, plays important roles in developmental morphogenesis, although the mechanism underlying activation of Ror2 remains largely elusive. We show that when expressed in mammalian cells, Ror2 associates with casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ), a crucial regulator of Wnt signaling. This association occurs primarily via the cytoplasmic C-terminal proline-rich domain of Ror2. We also show that Ror2 is phosphorylated by CKIϵ on serine/threonine residues, in its C-terminal serine/threonine-rich 2 domain, resulting in autophosphorylation of Ror2 on tyrosine residues. Furthermore, it was found that association of Ror2 with CKIϵ is required for its serine/threonine phosphorylation by CKIϵ. Site-directed mutagenesis of tyrosine residues in Ror2 reveals that the sites of phosphorylation are contained among the five tyrosine residues in the proline-rich domain but not among the four tyrosine residues in the tyrosine kinase domain. Moreover, we show that in mammalian cells, CKIϵ-mediated phosphorylation of Ror2 on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues is followed by the tyrosine phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, a kinase with a developmental expression pattern that is remarkably similar to that of Ror2. Intriguingly, a mutant of Ror2 lacking five tyrosine residues, including the autophosphorylation sites, fails to tyrosine phosphorylate G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2. This indicates that autophosphorylation of Ror2 is required for full activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. These findings demonstrate a novel role for CKIϵ in the regulation of Ror2 tyrosine kinase.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; CKIϵ, casein kinase Iϵ; GRK2, G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2; BDB, brachydactyly type B; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; WT, wild-type; GMCSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; WCL, whole cell lysate. play important roles in developmental morphogenesis by regulating growth, differentiation, motility, adhesion, and death of many types of cells (1Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). It has been well documented that the interactions of RTKs with their cognate ligands trigger their dimerization or oligomerization, resulting in tyrosine autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activation of RTKs. This induces various intracellular signaling events. In contrast, it has been reported that tyrosine autophosphorylation and the tyrosine kinase activities of several RTKs, including the insulin and epidermal growth factor receptors, can be negatively regulated by ligand-independent transphosphorylation of these RTKs by cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases (2Barbier A.J.

However, little is known about the positive regulation of RTK tyrosine autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activation caused by cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases. The mammalian Ror family of RTKs, consisting of two structurally related proteins, Ror1 and Ror2, are orphan RTKs, characterized by several conserved domain structures, the extracellular Frizzled-like cysteine-rich domains, and the membrane-proximal Kringle domains that are assumed to mediate protein-protein interactions (9Forrester W.C.

It has been reported that in nematodes and mammals, Ror family RTKs play crucial roles in various developmental processes. CAM-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of Ror2, is implicated in cell migration, asymmetric cell division, and axon outgrowth during embryogenesis, and these processes may be either tyrosine kinase-dependent or -independent (14Forrester W.C. Dell M. Perens E. Garriga G. Nature. 1999; 400: 881-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Previous studies with Ror2-deficient mice have further revealed that Ror2 plays crucial roles in the development of the skeletal, genital, and cardiovascular systems (15DeChiara T.M. Kimble R.B.

In humans, Ror2 is responsible for two heritable skeletal disorders; recessive Robinow syndrome and dominant brachydactyly type B (BDB) (18Afzal A.R. Jeffery S. Hum.

Percin E.F. Akarsu N. Brunner H.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the developmental pathology of Ror2–/– mice can explain many of the developmental malformations found in patients with Robinow syndrome (24Schwabe G.C. Trepczik B. Suring K. Brieske N. Tucker A. Sharpe P.T. Minami Y. Mundlos S. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Ror2 associates with the melanoma-associated antigen family protein, Dlxin-1, which exhibits a similar developmental expression pattern with Ror2 and is known to bind to the homeodomain proteins Msx2 and Dlx5. Ror2 appears to affect transcriptional functions of Msx2 and Dlx5 by regulating intracellular distribution of Dlxin-1 in a tyrosine kinase-independent manner (25Matsuda T. Suzuki H. Oishi I. Kani S. Kuroda Y. Komori T. Sasaki A. Watanabe K. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29057-29064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our recent genetic and biochemical analyses have indicated that Ror2 interacts with Wnt5a both physically and functionally to activate the noncanonical Wnt5a/JNK pathway in a tyrosine kinase-independent manner (16Oishi I. Suzuki H. Onishi N. Takada R. Kani S. Ohkawara B. Koshida I. Suzuki K. Yamada G. Schwabe G.C. Mundlos S. Shibuya H. Takada S. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, Xror2, a putative Xenopus ortholog of Ror2, has also been shown to interact with Xenopus Wnts and to modulate convergent extension movements of axial mesoderm and neuroectoderm by modulating the planar cell polarity pathway of Wnt signaling in a tyrosine kinase-independent manner (26Hikasa H. Shibata M. Hiratani I. Taira M. Development. 2002; 129: 5227-5239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying Ror2 tyrosine kinase activation and the consequent tyrosine kinase-dependent functions of Ror2. To gain insights into new functions of Ror2, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using Ror2 as bait to identify a candidate molecule(s) that interacts with Ror2. From this screen, we identified casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ), a member of the CKI family of protein serine/threonine kinases, as a molecule that interacts with Ror2. Recently, much attention has been paid to CKIϵ as a crucial regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling, although its exact role(s) in this regulation remains controversial (27Ding Y. Dale T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 327-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that CKIϵ can phosphorylate various Wnt signaling mediators, including Dvl (Dishevelled), adenomatous polyposis coli, axin, and β-catenin, thereby contributing to the regulation of the canonical Wnt pathway (28Amit S.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2073-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Here we show that Ror2 associates with and is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues by CKIϵ when expressed in mammalian cells. Interestingly, serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2 by CKIϵ is followed by the autophosphorylation of Ror2 tyrosine residue(s) within its cytoplasmic Pro-rich domain. Moreover, Ror2 associates with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) and tyrosine phosphorylates it following activation of Ror2 by CKIϵ. These results indicate that the tyrosine kinase activity and tyrosine autophosphorylation of Ror2 can be positively regulated by CKIϵ. We further provide evidence indicating that tyrosine autophosphorylation of Ror2 is required for activation of Ror2 tyrosine kinase. Plasmid Constructions—Wild-type and mutant cDNAs were constructed in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Expression vectors encoding the FLAG-tagged Ror proteins were constructed as described previously (25Matsuda T. Suzuki H. Oishi I. Kani S. Kuroda Y. Komori T. Sasaki A. Watanabe K. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29057-29064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Ror2 mutant constructs (ΔC, BDB, RS, Tc, Δ883, Δpro, ΔS/T1, ΔS/T2, and ΔS/T1,2) were generated by deleting amino acids 788–944, 749–944, 502–944, 434–944, 883–944, 783–859, 744–782, 860–882, 744–782 and 860–882, respectively, in the C-terminal region of Ror2. An expression vector encoding a kinasedead mutant of Ror2 was constructed by replacing lysine 507, crucial for ATP binding, with arginine. Ror2 mutants bearing substitutions of serine and threonine with alanines, Ror2 13S/TA (S860A, S861A, S864A, S866A, S868A, S870A, S879A, and S882A; T869A, T871A, T875A, T876A, and T881A) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. Ror2 mutants bearing substitutions of tyrosines with phenylalanines, Ror2 4YF (Y641F, Y645F, Y646F, and Y722F) and Ror2 5YF (Y818F, Y824F, Y830F, Y833F, and Y838F), were also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The cDNA fragment corresponding to CKIϵ was obtained by PCR and inserted into pcDNA3. The expression vector pcDNA-HA-CKIϵ DK, encoding a kinase-dead mutant of CKIϵ, was constructed by replacing lysine 38, crucial for ATP binding, with arginine. The plasmids encoding the GST fusion proteins, GST-CKIϵ WT and GST-CKIϵ DK, were constructed using the pGEX plasmids (Amersham Biosciences). Bovine GRK2 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Haga, Gakushuin University and Dr. Lefkowitz, Duke University) was subcloned into pcDNA3 together with the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein epitope tag at its C terminus (pcDNA-GRK2-HA). Antibodies, Cells, and Transfection—Rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Ror2 antibody was raised against GST mouse Ror2 (amino acids 726–945). The mouse monoclonal antibodies M2 (Sigma) and 12CA5 (Roche Applied Science) recognize the FLAG peptide and human influenza HA protein peptide sequence. Mouse monoclonal anti-CKIϵ antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies PY20 and 4G10 were purchased from Cell Signaling and Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., respectively. Rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were from Zymed Laboratories and Cell Signaling, respectively. HEK293T (293T) and NIH3T3 (3T3) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Transient cDNA transfection was performed using the calcium phosphate method (12Oishi I. Takeuchi S. Hashimoto R. Nagabukuro A. Ueda T. Liu Z.-J. Hatta T. Akira S. Matsuda Y. Yamamura H. Otani H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—The cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and the cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The cell lysates were precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The precleared supernatants were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with 1 ml of the above lysis buffer and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates or whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (9% PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters (Immobilon, Millipore). The membranes were immunoblotted with the respective antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies using chemiluminescence reagents (Western Lightning; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (12Oishi I. Takeuchi S. Hashimoto R. Nagabukuro A. Ueda T. Liu Z.-J. Hatta T. Akira S. Matsuda Y. Yamamura H. Otani H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The GST fusion proteins, GST-CKIϵ WT and GST-CKIϵ DK, expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α were extracted with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and were isolated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins were then eluted from beads by 25 mm glutathione (reduced), followed by dialysis prior to use in kinase assays. In Vitro Kinase Assay—For in vitro kinase assay, 293T cells were solubilized 60 h after transfection, and Ror2 WT-FLAG or Ror2 DK-FLAG proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above. Precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 50 μl kinase buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 40 μm ATP. The in vitro kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of purified GST-CKIϵ WT or GST-CKIϵ DK and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filters, followed by immunoblot analysis with antiphospho-serine/threonine antibodies. In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization analyses were performed essentially as described previously (34Matsuda T. Nomi M. Ikeya M. Kani S. Oishi I. Terashima T. Takada S. Minami Y. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The 0.86-kb HincII/EcoRI fragment of Ror2 or the 0.87-kb HincII/ApaI fragment of GRK2 were utilized as templates to synthesize single strand RNA probes. Ror2 Associates with CKIϵ—To identify a Ror2-interacting protein(s), we performed a yeast two-hybrid screening using the cytoplasmic region of Ror2 as bait (25Matsuda T. Suzuki H. Oishi I. Kani S. Kuroda Y. Komori T. Sasaki A. Watanabe K. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29057-29064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From this screen we identified a protein serine/threonine kinase, CKIϵ (data not shown). To determine whether Ror2 associates with CKIϵ in mammalian cells, FLAG-tagged wild-type Ror2 (Ror2 WT) and HA-tagged CKIϵ were coexpressed in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, HA-tagged CKIϵ was coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Ror2, indicating that Ror2 associates with CKIϵ in vivo. We also found that endogenous CKIϵ was detected in anti-Ror2 immunoprecipitates from 3T3 cells, confirming association between endogenous Ror2 and CKIϵ (Fig. 1B). Next, to identify a cytoplasmic domain(s) within Ror2 required for its association with CKIϵ, we generated a series of truncated mutants of Ror2 (Fig. 1C) and evaluated their abilities to associate with CKIϵ in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 1D, the Ror2 mutants Ror2 ΔC and Ror2 BDB (Fig. 1C) exhibited apparently decreased levels of CKIϵ binding compared with the Ror2 WT. To map more precisely an association domain within the C-terminal portion of Ror2, we generated additional deletion mutants of Ror2 (Δ883, ΔS/T2, Δpro, ΔS/T1, and ΔS/T1,2) (Fig. 1C) and tested their abilities to associate with CKIϵ. As shown in Fig. 1E, among them only the Ror2 Δpro exhibited drastically decreased levels of CKIϵ binding. The result indicates that the proline-rich domain of Ror2 is required critically for association with CKIϵ. On the other hand, the Ror2 RS and Ror2 Tc (Fig. 1C), both lacking the tyrosine kinase domain, failed to associate with CKIϵ, suggesting that the tyrosine kinase domain of Ror2 is also required for association (Fig. 1D). Because we have previously shown that Ror2 associates with Dlxin-1 (NRAGE) via the proline-rich domain of Ror2 (25Matsuda T. Suzuki H. Oishi I. Kani S. Kuroda Y. Komori T. Sasaki A. Watanabe K. Minami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29057-29064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), we also examined whether or not association of CKIϵ and Dlxin-1 with Ror2 is competitive. It was found that association of CKIϵ with Ror2 was unaffected by ectopic coexpression of Dlxin-1 vice versa (see first supplemental figure). Serine/Threonine Phosphorylation of Ror2 by CKIϵ—We next examined whether or not Ror2 is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues by CKIϵ in mammalian cells. To this end, FLAG-tagged Ror2 was expressed along with either HA-tagged wild-type (WT) or kinase inactive mutant (DK) of CKIϵ in 293T cells, and serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2 was examined by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation followed by anti-phosphoserine/threonine immunoblotting (see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2A, Ror2 was phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues in cells coexpressing CKIϵ WT but not CKIϵ DK, indicating that the kinase activity of CKIϵ is required for serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2. We also examined whether Dlxin-1 is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues by CKIϵ in the presence of Ror2. It appeared that Dlxin-1 was not phosphorylated by CKIϵ (see second supplemental figure), suggesting that Ror2 may transduce signals via CKIϵ and Dlxin-1 separately. To test whether CKIϵ could phosphorylate Ror2 directly, GST-CKIϵ WT and GST-CKIϵ DK proteins purified from E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”) were subjected to in vitro kinase assay using FLAG-tagged WT or kinase-inactive Ror2 mutant (DK) as substrates. As shown in Fig. 2B, GST-CKIϵ WT, but not GST-CKIϵ DK, could phosphorylate serine/threonine residues within both Ror2 WT and Ror2 DK in vitro, supporting the idea that CKIϵ phosphorylates Ror2 directly. We also examined the phosphorylation status of the Ror2 ΔS/T1, ΔS/T2, ΔS/T1,2, and Δpro in mammalian cells coexpressing CKIϵ. The Ror2 ΔS/T2, ΔS/T1,2, and Δpro exhibited a complete loss of serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2, whereas the Ror2 ΔS/T1 showed somewhat weak, yet apparent serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2, compared with the Ror2 WT (Fig. 2C). Next, we attempted to identify serine/threonine phosphorylation sites within Ror2 by CKIϵ. Because serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2 was found in the Ror2 ΔS/T1 but not Ror2 ΔS/T2 mutants, we generated the Ror2 13S/TA mutant in which all of the serines and threonines in the S/T2 domain of Ror2 were replaced with alanines (Fig. 1C). As shown in Fig. 2C, the Ror2 13S/TA mutant could associate with CKIϵ but failed to be phosphorylated by CKIϵ, indicating that CKIϵ phosphorylates primarily serine/threonine residues in the S/T2 domain of Ror2. Tyrosine Autophosphorylation of Ror2 Following Its Serine/Threonine Phosphorylation by CKIϵ—To better understand the biological consequence of Ror2 phosphorylation by CKIϵ, we transiently coexpressed FLAG-tagged Ror2 WT with either CKIϵ WT or CKIϵ DK in 293T cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ror2 was detected when Ror2 and CKIϵ WT were coexpressed, but not when Ror2 was expressed alone or coexpressed with CKIϵ DK (Fig. 3A). The results indicate that CKIϵ kinase activity is required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Ror2. Next, FLAG-tagged Ror2 WT or Ror2 DK was expressed along with CKIϵ WT, and Ror2 tyrosine phosphorylation was evaluated. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Ror2 WT, but not Ror2 DK, was observed under the same experimental setting, although Ror2 DK was also associated with and serine/threonine-phosphorylated by CKIϵ to similar extents when compared with Ror2 WT (Fig. 3B). Thus, CKIϵ-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Ror2 requires the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of Ror2. We further attempted to identify tyrosine phosphorylation sites within Ror2 induced by coexpression of CKIϵ. We have previously shown that the tyrosine kinase domains of the Ror family RTKs are most similar to those of the neurotrophin receptor Trk family of RTKs and that the four autophosphorylated tyrosine residues found in the activation loops within the tyrosine kinase domains of the Trk family RTKs are also conserved in Ror2 (Tyr641, Tyr645, Tyr646, and Tyr722) (12Oishi I. Takeuchi S. Hashimoto R. Nagabukuro A. Ueda T. Liu Z.-J. Hatta T. Akira S. Matsuda Y. Yamamura H. Otani H. Minami Y. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We also found that coexpression of CKIϵ failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Ror2 ΔC (data not shown). The Ror2 ΔC lacks the C-terminal portion of Ror2, which contains six tyrosine residues, including five (Tyr818, Tyr824, Tyr830, Tyr833, and Tyr838) that are found in the Pro-rich domain. Thus, we generated the two Ror2 mutants, 4YF and 5YF (Fig. 3C and see “Experimental Procedures”), in which the tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanines. When FLAG-tagged Ror2 4YF and 5YF were expressed in 293T cells along with CKIϵ, it was found that both the Ror2 4YF and 5YF could associate with CKIϵ and were phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues to a similar extent as Ror2 WT (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, when coexpressed with CKIϵ, Ror2 4YF but not Ror2 5YF was found to be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (Fig. 3D). This indicates that the sites of tyrosine autophosphorylation are among the five tyrosine residues contained within the Pro-rich domain but not among the four tyrosine residues contained within the tyrosine kinase domain. We then examined whether serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2 by CKIϵ is required for tyrosine autophosphorylation of Ror2. For this purpose, tyrosine phosphorylation status of the 13S/TA was monitored in the presence of CKIϵ. When Ror2 WT and 13S/TA mutant were expressed in 293T cells along with CKIϵ, tyrosine autophosphorylation of Ror2 was found in Ror2 WT but not 13S/TA (Fig. 3E). This result indicates that serine/threonine phosphorylation of Ror2 by CKIϵ is required for subsequent tyrosine autophosphorylation of Ror2. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of GRK2 by Ror2 Following Coexpression of CKIϵ—The Ror2-interacting proteins, CKIϵ and Dlxin-1 (see Fig. 5A), were not tyrosine-phosphorylated by Ror2 when coexpressed with CKIϵ (data not shown). We therefore searched for other candidate molecule(s) that could be tyrosinephosphorylated by Ror2 under the same experimental conditions. The gene encoding the GRK2 was reported to exhibit a developmental expression pattern very similar to those of Ror2 (Fig. 4A) and Dlxin-1 (data not shown), as verified by whole mount in situ hybridization analyses on mouse embryos at embryonic day 10.5 (Fig. 4A; data not shown), (34Matsuda T. Nomi M. Ikeya M. Kani S. Oishi I. Terashima T. Takada S. Minami Y. Mech. Dev. 2001; 105: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Sefton M. Blanco M.J. Penela P. Mayor F.

Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In particular, Ror2 and GRK2 exhibited remarkably similar expression patterns in the pharyngeal arches and developing limb buds at embryonic day 10.5 (Fig. 4A). We therefore examined whether or not Ror2 could associate with GRK2. As shown in Fig. 4B, HA-tagged GRK2 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-tagged Ror2, indicating that Ror2 associates with GRK2 in vivo. In addition, it was found that the association of Ror2 with GRK2 was unaffected by coexpression of CKIϵ (data not shown).Fig. 4Ror2 associates with GRK2 in vivo.A, developmental expression patterns of Ror2 and GRK2.

https://openalex.org/W1921477599,"The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), in addition to regulating lipid homeostasis, controls the level of tissue damage after chemical or physical stress. To determine the role of PPARα in oxidative stress responses, we examined damage after exposure to chemicals that increase oxidative stress in wild-type or PPARα-null mice. Primary hepatocytes from wild-type but not PPARα-null mice pretreated with the PPAR pan-agonist WY-14,643 (WY) were protected from damage to cadmium and paraquat. The livers from intact wild-type but not PPARα-null mice were more resistant to damage after carbon tetrachloride treatment. To determine the molecular basis of the protection by PPARα, we identified by transcript profiling genes whose expression was altered by a 7-day exposure to WY in wild-type and PPARα-null mice. Of the 815 genes regulated by WY in wild-type mice (p ≤ 0.001; ≥1.5-fold or ≤-1.5-fold), only two genes were regulated similarly by WY in PPARα-null mice. WY increased expression of stress modifier genes that maintain the health of the proteome, including those that prevent protein aggregation (heat stress-inducible chaperones) and eliminate damaged proteins (proteasome components). Although the induction of proteasomal genes significantly overlapped with those regulated by 1,2-dithiole-3-thione, an activator of oxidant-inducible Nrf2, WY increased expression of proteasomal genes independently of Nrf2. Thus, PPARα controls the vast majority of gene expression changes after exposure to WY in the mouse liver and protects the liver from oxidant-induced damage, possibly through regulation of a distinct set of proteome maintenance genes.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARα, -β, and -γ), a subset of the nuclear receptor superfamily, mediate many, if not all, of the adaptive consequences of PP exposure (1Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 2Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 790-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Activation of PPARα results in a predictable set of responses in the livers of rats and mice, including increased expression of fatty acid β-oxidation genes, hepatocyte peroxisome proliferation, hepatomegaly, hepatocyte hyperplasia, and increased incidence of liver tumors. These responses require a functional PPARα, since PP-exposed PPARα-null mice lack all of these responses (3Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M.

Lai D.Y. McKee R.H. Peters J.M. Roberts R.A. Fenner-Crisp P.A. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 2003; 33: 655-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). PPARα also regulates genes involved in fatty acid catabolism in the absence of PP exposure in the liver (5Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). Although it is often assumed that the transcriptional changes in the liver after PP exposure are PPARα-dependent, no study has shown this directly by comparing transcript profiles in PP-treated wild-type and PPARα-null mice. In addition to roles in regulating lipid homeostasis, PPARα protects tissues from age-dependent and chemical-induced stress. Age-dependent increases in NF-κB activation, inflammatory cytokine production, and lipid peroxidation were suppressed in wild-type but not PPARα-null mice treated with WY or the PP, dehydroepiandrosterone (6Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Prior exposure of rats and mice to PP protects the liver from damage induced by exposure to cytotoxic agents (7Mehendale H.M. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 57: 187-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PP, clofibrate, protected the liver from damage induced by acetaminophen in wild-type but not PPARα-null mice (8Chen C. Hennig G.E. Whiteley H.E. Corton J.C. Manautou J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 57: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). PPARα-null mice exhibit defects in protection or regeneration in the liver after physical or chemical damage (9Anderson S.P. Yoon L. Richard E.B. Dunn C.S. Cattley R.C. Corton J.C. Hepatology. 2002; 36: 544-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Shankar K. Vaidya V.S. Corton J.C. Bucci T.J. Liu J. Waalkes M.P. Mehendale H.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1748-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The genes regulated by PPARα involved in protection from chemical-induced damage have not been systematically identified. Physiological and chemical stresses produce disease states in which proteins are damaged or misfolded. Many endogenous pathways are engaged in restoring cellular homeostasis, including stabilization of unfolded proteins to prevent aggregation and removing damaged or excess proteins. Stabilization of unfolded proteins is performed by molecular chaperones that normally assist in folding of nascent polypeptides. Many of these genes exhibit increased expression after exposure to a wide variety of stimuli including chemical exposure or increased temperatures and are thus called heat shock proteins. Expression of some heat shock proteins is essential for cellular survival under physical or chemical exposure conditions that increase oxidative stress (11Benjamin I.J. McMillan D.R. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Regulation of the Hsp genes by heat or chemical-induced oxidative stress is controlled by heat shock factors (HSFs) activated under conditions in which the level of unfolded proteins increase. The proteasome carries out ubiquitin-dependent and -independent proteolysis of damaged proteins (12Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome consists of a 20 S core containing 14 different subunits and two 19 S regulatory particles containing an additional 14 subunits. Proteasomal (Psm) gene expression can be induced by treating cells with proteasomal inhibitors (13Meiners S. Heyken D. Weller A. Ludwig A. Stangl K. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21517-21525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) or by the indirect antioxidant 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), which activates the oxidant-inducible transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) (14Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Like PPARα, activation of Nrf2 protects cells from different forms of stress (15Kwak M.K. Egner P.A. Dolan P.M. Ramos-Gomez M. Groopman J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In addition to the Psm genes, Nrf2 regulates genes involved in phase II xenobiotic metabolism through the antioxidant response element. Nrf2 is negatively regulated by Keap1, an actin-binding protein that sequesters Nrf2 in the cytoplasm. Indirect antioxidants such as the dithiolthionines (e.g. D3T) cause the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and enhanced expression of cytoprotective genes. Studies using Nrf2-null or Keap1/Nrf2-null mice have shown that Nrf2 is a key sensor regulating the expression of genes promoting cell survival (15Kwak M.K. Egner P.A. Dolan P.M. Ramos-Gomez M. Groopman J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism that may contribute to the ability of Nrf2 and dithiolthionines to increase cell survival after toxicant exposure is the increased expression of Psm genes through antioxidant response elements in their promoter regions (16Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Greenlaw J.L. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8786-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Usingoligonucleotidearrays,weexaminedtheextentofPPARα-dependent gene expression changes after WY-14,643 (WY) exposure in the livers of wild-type and PPARα-null mice. To help identify stress-inducible genes, we compared the WY profiles with those from two treatments that induce genes involved in tissue protection. We found that PPARα regulates a large battery of genes involved in maintenance of the proteome and that these genes partially overlap with genes regulated by stress-inducible transcription factors, Nrf2 and HSF. Consistent with this, hepatocytes from PPARα-null mice exhibit decreased resistance to oxidative stress induced by chemical exposure. Animals and Treatments—Wild-type and PPARα-null mice 9–12 weeks of age on an SV129 background were used in these studies. The mice were originally obtained from Dr. Frank Gonzalez, NCI, National Institutes of Health. Control and treated mice were provided with NIH-07 rodent chow (Zeigler Brothers, Gardeners, PA) and deionized, filtered water ad libitum. Lighting was on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Male mice were given by gavage each day for 3 days the PPAR pan-agonist WY-14,643 (ChemSyn Science, Lenexa, KS) at 50 mg/kg/day. Male mice were also fed a control diet or a diet containing WY in the diet (500 ppm) for 1 week followed by a 40-min heat stress at 42 °C or held at room temperature in wire rack cages. Mice were sacrificed 4 h after the heat stress. Male and female mice were given 250 μl/kg CCl4 by intraperitoneal injection and examined for morbidity/mortality over a 48-h period. In a separate study, male mice were given the indicated concentration of CCl4 and sacrificed 48 h later. Male wild-type and Keap1/Nrf2-null mice were treated with one dose of D3T (0.5 mmol/kg) and sacrificed 24 h later (14Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8135-8145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). For the Nrf2 nuclear localization experiments, male B6C3F1 mice were given one or seven consecutive daily doses of WY (50 mg/kg) by gavage as described above. Mice were either sacrificed at 6 h after the single dose or 24 h after the last of seven consecutive doses. Male Nrf2-null mice or corresponding wild-type mice on an ICR genetic background were given seven consecutive doses of WY by gavage as described above and sacrificed 24 h after the last dose. Portions of the livers were rapidly snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C until analysis. Where appropriate, slices of liver were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, transferred to 70% ethanol, and embedded in paraffin; 5-μm sections were cut and mounted on slides and stained with H&E. H&E-stained liver sections were examined by light microscopy. All animal studies were conducted under federal guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals and were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Conditions for Culturing and Treatment of Primary Hepatocytes— Primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes were obtained using a two-step collagenase perfusion method as described by Kedderis and Held (17Kedderis G.L. Held S.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Preparations over 85% viable were used for cell culture. Cells were plated in wells that had been treated with rat tail collagen, using Williams media E containing 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. After 2 h, the media were changed to serum-free media containing insulin, transferrin, and selenium (Invitrogen), l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and dexamethasone. The cultures were left overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cell cultures were treated the following morning with Me2SO or WY (50 μm final concentration). After 24 h, the cells were also treated with the indicated concentrations of paraquat or cadmium to induce oxidative stress with or without WY in the media. Cells and media were harvested 24 h after treatment. The lactate dehydrogenase assay was used to assess damage as described (17Kedderis G.L. Held S.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Analysis of Gene Expression—For the analysis of gene expression by oligonucleotide arrays, liver tissue from three mice was analyzed from each treatment group. Liver RNA was isolated using a modified guanidium isothiocyanate method (TRIzol®; Invitrogen) and was further purified using silica membrane spin columns (RNeasy®; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA integrity was assessed by ethidium bromide staining followed by resolution on denaturing agarose gels and also by the RNA 6000 LabChip® kit using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). For each sample, 15 μg of biotin-labeled cRNA was generated from 10 μg of total RNA and hybridized to GeneChip® Test3 arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) to determine the quality of the RNA. Subsequently, the same samples were hybridized to Murine GeneChip® U74Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix). All procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations using the antibody amplification technique. Images were initially processed using MAS version 5.0 software (Affymetrix). Hybridization quality was assessed by visual inspection of the image and from a report generated by MAS version 5.0. Criteria for an acceptable hybridization were the following: background, <100; noise (RawQ), <5; 3′/5′ ratio for select housekeeping genes, <4. Hybridizations not meeting these criteria were repeated, beginning at the target preparation step. The data were analyzed and statistically filtered using Rosetta Resolver® version 3.0 software (Rosetta Inpharmatics, Kirkland, WA). The threshold for significance for these experiments was set at p ≤ 0.001 and ≥1.5- or ≤-1.5-fold change, and the relative increase or decrease in mRNA abundance for each gene was reported as a -fold change relative to wild-type or null controls. Genes were grouped into functional classes using Gene Ontology (available on the World Wide Web at www.gene-ontology.org) identifiers found in the U74Av2 template (version available August 1, 2003 on the World Wide Web at www.affymetrix.com). The functional categories and their corresponding gene ontology (GO) numbers were as follows: peroxisome biogenesis, 7031; lipid transport, 6869; fatty acid metabolism, 6631 and 6635; fatty acid biosynthesis, 6633; glutathione transferase, 4364; glutathione conjugation, 6803; monooxygenase activity, 4497; response to heat, 9408; translational elongation, 6414; initiation factor, 5851 and 5852; translation initiation, 6413; chaperone, 3754; protein folding, 6457; disulfide isomerase, 3755; ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism, 6511; proteasome, 501 and 4299. To compare expression of the genes in each functional class between treatment groups, we first eliminated genes that were expressed at low levels (<300; ∼5% of the average gene expression in wild-type mouse liver) and not altered by compound treatment in any group. Expression changes were averaged over all genes in that GO category. Categories that had <10% of all genes altered were eliminated. The average number of genes altered in each gene category was 21%. Categories were visualized by TreeView (18Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13204) Google Scholar). Identification of expressed sequence tags was facilitated by euGenes (available on the World Wide Web at iubio.bio.indiana.edu:89/mouse/). Identification of potential binding sites for PPARα in proteasome genes was made using the Transcription Element Search System (available on the World Wide Web at www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/). Sequences upstream of the start codon were retrieved from the World Wide Web at genome.ucsc.edu/index.html?org = Mouse with links from GeneLynx (available on the World Wide Web at www.genelynx.org/MOUSE/). 4 kb of the promoter region was analyzed for each gene using the consensus PPRE sequence 5′-TGACCTnTGACCTnAGTT-3′. Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—The levels of expression of the selected genes were quantified using real time RT-PCR analysis. Briefly, total RNA was extracted as described above and reverse transcribed with murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers. The forward and reverse primers for selected genes (Supplementary Table I) were designed using Primer Express software, version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The SYBR green DNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was used for real time PCR analysis. The relative differences in expression between groups were expressed using cycle time (Ct) values as follows. The Ct values of the genes were first normalized with β-actin of the same sample, and then the relative differences between control and treatment groups were calculated and expressed as relative increases, setting the control as 100%. Assuming that the Ct value is reflective of the initial starting copy and that there is 100% efficiency, a difference of one cycle is equivalent to a 2-fold difference in starting copy. Nuclear Localization of Nrf2—Hepatic nuclear extracts were isolated from liver homogenates according to Dignam et al. (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 11: 1475-1489Crossref Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed by loading 25 μg of nuclear extract on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Following separation, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and immunoblotting was carried out using a commercial anti-Nrf2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblotted membranes were developed using the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis of Data—Means and S.E. (n = 4) for RT-PCR data were calculated by Student's t test. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. The expression ratios between WY treatment and controls and between WT mice and Nrf2-null mice were used for comparisons. Spearman rank correlation test was performed using SAS (SAS version 6.12, SAS Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). PPARα Alters Responses to Chemical-induced Stress—We hypothesized from previous studies that hepatocytes from PPARα-null mice would be more sensitive to chemical-induced oxidative damage. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effect of chemicals that induce protein damage through increases in oxidative stress. In in vitro studies, primary hepatocytes isolated from wild-type or PPARα-null mice were pretreated with WY or Me2SO followed by co-treatment with WY or Me2SO and either paraquat or cadmium, inducers of oxidative stress. Damage after chemical exposure was assessed by leakage of lactate dehydrogenase. WY exposure itself did not induce cell damage. Hepatocytes from Me2SO-treated, wild-type, or PPARα-null mice exhibited extensive damage after exposure to paraquat or cadmium (Fig. 1, A and B). Damage induced by either compound was significantly suppressed by pretreatment with WY in wild-type but not in PPARα-null mice. We examined the effect of chemical treatment in the intact mouse. Wild-type and PPARα-null mice were exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), an inducer of centrilobular necrosis in mice and rats. The active species is a free radical form that induces extensive lipid and protein damage (20Plaa G.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 42-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mice were given one intraperitoneal injection of 250 μl of CCl4 per kg of body weight. After 2 days of treatment, all male PPARα-null mice and 40% of the female PPARα-null mice either died or were moribund, whereas only a quarter of the male wild-type mice and none of the female wild-type mice exhibited outward signs of toxicity. The characteristic centrilobular necrosis was also more severe in male PPARα-null mice and included bridging necrosis between central veins (Fig. 2A). Necrosis after CCl4 exposure in male PPARα-null mice was observed at lower doses than wild-type mice. At higher doses, the extent of damage was approximately the same in the two strains (Fig. 2B). These studies indicate that PPARα determines the extent of damage to agents that induce increases in oxidative stress. PPARα Is Required for the Majority of Transcriptional Changes Altered by WY—To uncover the gene regulatory networks under control of PPARα that may contribute to alteration of chemical-induced damage, we examined the transcript profiles in the livers of wild-type and PPARα-null mice exposed to WY for 7 days. In wild-type mice, WY altered 6.5% of the genes queried, including 434 up-regulated and 381 down-regulated genes. WY had almost no effect in PPARα-null mice. Only two genes were altered by WY in PPARα-null mice, namely Cyp4a10 (10.0-fold increase in wild type versus 9.5-fold in PPARα-null) and Cyp4a14 (15.7-fold increase in wild type versus 4.5-fold in PPARα-null). Only one gene (serum amyloid A protein 4; Saa4) linked to inflammatory responses was altered in PPARα-null but not wild-type mice by WY (19.5-fold induction). The fact that there were so few parallel changes in both wild-type and PPARα-null mice was not due to the stringency of our -fold change cut-off. When we examined significantly altered genes (p ≤ 0.001) without prior filtering for -fold change, only Ugdh (1.5-fold increase in wild-type versus 1.4-fold increase in PPARα-null) and Acox1 (2.4-fold increase in wild-type versus 1.2-fold increase in PPARα-null) exhibited similar expression behavior in both strains. Acox1 was induced in PPARα-null mice treated by a PPARβ and a PPARγ agonist but not by WY (21DeLuca J.G. Doebber T.W. Kelly L.J. Kemp R.K. Molon-Noblot S. Sahoo S.P. Ventre J. Wu M.S. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Moller D.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that PPARα mediates the vast majority of transcriptional changes after WY exposure in the mouse liver. Alteration of Proteome Maintenance Genes by PPARα—As preliminary experiments indicated altered regulation of heat stress-inducible genes by PPARα, 2S. P. Anderson and J. C. Corton, unpublished observations. we compared the WY transcript profiles with transcript profiles in which heat stress-inducible genes involved in tissue protection were altered including after a 40-min 42 °C heat stress or after exposure to D3T, an antioxidant compound that indirectly activates Nrf2 (15Kwak M.K. Egner P.A. Dolan P.M. Ramos-Gomez M. Groopman J.D. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 480: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Transcript profiles were compared directly using Spearman correlation as a measure of similarity between groups. The correlation coefficients were statistically significant between WY in wild-type mice and D3T in either wild-type or Keap1/Nrf2-null mice (Table I), indicating that D3T alters a set of overlapping genes through a mechanism that is at least partly Keap1/Nrf2-independent. There was also a significant overlap in the profiles altered by WY and heat stress in wild-type mice. The correlation became insignificant between WY and heat stress in PPARα-null mice, indicating that PPARα controls the expression of heat stress-regulated genes that determine similarity with the WY transcript profile.Table IComparison of transcript profiles altered by WY, D3T, and heat stress (HS) using Spearman rank correlationChemical/treatment, genotypeWY, PPARα-nullD3T, WTD3T, Keap1/Nrf2-nullHS, WTHS, PPARα-nullWY, WT–0.028aSpearman rank correlation (R) (0.2417)bp value.

Significant R values are shown in boldface type Open table in a new tab To facilitate comparison of the different treatments, the altered genes were grouped into GO functional groups as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this analysis, we included those genes altered in wild-type and PPARα-null mice after a 3-day treatment with WY. These genes have been previously characterized (22Anderson S.A. Dunn C. Laughter A. Yoon L. Swanson C. Stulnig T.M. Steffensen K.R. Chandraratna R.A.S. Gustafsson J-Å. Corton J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all categories of genes were regulated similarly after 3- or 7-day WY treatment. However, many categories exhibited greater responsiveness after longer exposure. Genes involved in lipid metabolism including peroxisome biogenesis, lipid transport, fatty acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis genes were generally up-regulated by a 7-day and, to a lesser extent, 3-day WY treatment (Fig. 3), as expected (1Corton J.C. Anderson S.P. Stauber A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 491-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Genes involved in lipid metabolism and stress responses are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Materials. Based on evidence that PPARα acts to prevent damage from chemical-induced stress, we focused on the expression behavior of genes involved in maintenance of the proteome. These genes include those that regulate translation; protein folding, including the chaperones and functionally related chaperonins; and proteolysis, including genes involved in ubiquitin tagging and elimination of damaged or excess proteins. Of the 14 genes involved in protein synthesis (GO:6414, 5851, 5852, 6413) that were regulated either by WY, D3T, or heat stress, WY increased the expression of one initiation factor (Eif3s6) and two elongation factors (Tcebf1 and 2300002G02Rik), whereas D3T increased the expression of six factors (Eifs6, Eifs7, Gspt1, Itgb4bp, Psmd7, and 3230401O13Rik), some of which were Keap1/Nrf2-independent (Fig. S2). Heat stress in PPARα-null but not wild-type mice led to an increase in one gene (Sui1-rs1) and decreases in three genes (Gspt1, Tcea1, and 2300002G02Rik). Of the 29 nonredundant genes involved in protein folding (GO:3754, 6457, 3755) including 10 overlapping genes known to be regulated by heat stress (GO:9408), WY up-regulated 12 genes and down-regulated four genes (Fig. 4A). The up-regulated genes included chaperonin subunits (Cct3, Cct6a, Cct7, Hspd1, and Hspe1), heat shock proteins (Hspa1b and Hspca), GrpE-like proteins (Grpel1 and Grpel2), and miscellaneous proteins (Dnajb10, Fkbp1a, and Tbca). Two of the down-regulated genes have protein-disulfide isomerase (Pdir-pending) or peptidylprolylisomerase (Ppib) functions. D3T up-regulated a set of 10 genes in which three overlapped with those regulated by WY. Heat stress in wild-type mice up-regulated four genes and down-regulated one. Spearman comparison of the WY- and D3T-regulated genes did not sho"
https://openalex.org/W2027697189,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) has key roles in the regulation of adipogenesis, inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism. C-peptide is believed to be inert and without appreciable biological functions. Recent studies suggest that C-peptide possesses multiple functions. The present study investigated the effects of insulin and C-peptide on PPARγ transcriptional activity in opossum kidney proximal tubular cells. Both insulin and C-peptide induced a concentration-dependent stimulation of PPARγ transcriptional activity. Both agents substantially augmented thiazolidinedione-stimulated PPARγ transcriptional activity. Neither insulin nor C-peptide had any effect on the expression levels of PPARγ. GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, blocked PPARγ activation by thiazolidinediones but had no effect on either insulin- or C-peptide-stimulated PPARγ transcriptional activity. Co-transfection of opossum kidney cells with dominant negative mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase significantly depressed basal PPARγ transcriptional activity but had no effect on that induced by either insulin or C-peptide. Both insulin- and C-peptide-stimulated PPARγ transcriptional activity were attenuated by wortmannin and by expression of a dominant negative phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. In addition PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ was observed after stimulation by C-peptide or insulin. C-peptide effects but not insulin on PPARγ transcriptional activity were abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Finally both C-peptide and insulin positively control the expression of the PPARγ-regulated CD36 scavenger receptor in human THP-1 monocytes. We concluded that insulin and C-peptide can stimulate PPARγ activity in a ligand-independent fashion and that this effect is mediated by PI 3-kinase. These results support a new and potentially important physiological role for C-peptide in regulation of PPARγ-related cell functions."

Because the FXI receptor in the platelet membrane is contained within the glycoprotein Ibα subunit of the glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex (Baglia, F. A., Badellino, K. O., Li, C. Q., Lopez, J. A., and Walsh, P. N. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 1662–1668), we utilized mocarhagin, a cobra venom metalloproteinase, to generate a fragment (His1–Glu282) of glycoprotein Ibα that contains the leucine-rich repeats of the NH2-terminal globular domain and excludes the macroglycopeptide portion of glycocalicin, the soluble extracytoplasmic portion of glycoprotein Ibα. This fragment was able to compete with FXI for binding to activated platelets (Ki of 3.125 ± 0.25 nm) with a potency similar to that of intact glycocalicin (Ki of 3.72 ± 0.30 nm). However, a synthetic glycoprotein Ibα peptide, Asp269–Asp287, containing a thrombin binding site had no effect on the binding of FXI to activated platelets. Moreover, the binding of 125I-labeled thrombin to glycocalicin was unaffected by the presence of FXI at concentrations up to 10-5m. The von Willebrand factor A1 domain, which binds the leucine-rich repeats, inhibited the binding of FXI to activated platelets. Thus, we examined the effect of synthetic peptides of each of the seven leucine-rich repeats on the binding of 125I-FXI to activated platelets. All leucine-rich repeat (LRR) peptides derived from glycoprotein Ibα were able to inhibit FXI binding to activated platelets in the following order of decreasing potency: LRR7, LRR1, LRR4, LRR5, LRR6, LRR3, and LRR2. However, the leucine-rich repeat synthetic peptides derived from glycoprotein Ibβ and Toll protein had no effect. We conclude that FXI binds to glycoprotein Ibα at sites comprising the leucine-rich repeat sequences within the NH2-terminal globular domain that are separate and distinct from the thrombin-binding site.

The platelet GPIb-IX-V complex is a large plasma membrane complex (∼25,000 copies/platelet) comprising four polypeptide chains, GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and GPV, arranged in a stoichiometry of 2:2:2:1, respectively (14Lopez J.A. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1994; 5: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This receptor is responsible for platelet adhesion to the site of injury, a function that it carries out by binding the von Willebrand factor (vWF). The GPIb-IX-V complex also binds thrombin with high affinity. Glycocalicin is the soluble form of the extracellular portion of GPIbα, which contains the NH2-terminal globular domain as well as the macroglycopeptide region. GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIbIX, and GPIbV each contain an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and a short cytoplasmic trail. The binding sites within the complex for both vWF and thrombin reside within the first 300 amino acids of GPIbα (15De Marco L. Mazzucato M. Masotti A. Fenton J.W.D. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

This modification is essential for GPIbα binding to thrombin and may contribute to the interaction with vWF (26Dong J. Ye P. Schade A.J. Gao S. Romo G.M. Turner N.T. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol.

Thus, the biological relevance and structural determinants of GPIbα interactions with thrombin and the A1 domain of vWF are relatively well understood. In contrast, although GPIbα appears to comprise the platelet receptor and physiological locus for the FXI colocalization with thrombin leading to initiation of the consolidation pathway of blood coagulation (8Baglia F.A.

The present studies demonstrate that FXI and thrombin bind GPIbα at distinct sites, which suggest that GPIbα may allow the colocalization of FXI and thrombin for efficient activation of FXI on the platelet surface.

In competition binding experiments, the concentration of the competitor that displaced 50% of the bound 125I-FXI (IC50) was determined by plotting the amount of 125I-FXI bound to platelets versus the amount of competitor ligand added. The Ki was calculated using the equation IC50 = (1 ± [s]/Kd)Ki, where [s] is the concentration of 125I-FXI used in these experiments (held constant at 22 nm) and the Kd was the value (∼10 nm) determined from direct binding experiments.Fig. 5The effect of A1 domain vWF (wild-type) and vWF-A1 2B mutant I546V on the binding of FXI to activated platelets. The effects of vWF-A1 domains were examined, including wild-type A1 domain vWF (⋄), wild-type A1 domain vWF and ristocetin (1.5 μg/ml) (X), the vWF-A1 2B mutant I546V (♦), and the vWF-A1 2B mutant I546V and ristocetin (1.5 μg/ml) (). 125I-FXI (22 nm), gel-filtered platelets (1 × 108 platelets/ml), ZnCl2 (25 μm), CaCl2 (2 mm), the thrombin receptor activation peptide (25 μm), and HK (42 nm) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C either with the designated peptide at the indicated concentration or with buffer solution. Aliquots were removed and centrifuged as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each point is the average of triplicate determinations. When 125I-FXI was incubated with platelets at time 0 (at the start of the incubation), the amount of 125I-FXI bound was <1% of the control value, and the maximum variation of counts per minute bound for each experimental observation was <2% of the total counts per minute bound. One hundred percent binding of FXI represents an average of 98,910 cpm bound, whereas 0% binding to FXI represents 0% bound after subtracting 150 cpm, representing the control in which 125I-FXI was incubated with platelets at time 0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6The effect of LRR synthetic peptides on the binding of 125I-FXI to platelets.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13268-13273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to examine the binding of 125I-FXI to platelet-bound glycocalicin. Wheat germ lectin (10 μg/ml) was coated on the wells of a solid phase plate (96-well polystyrene trays; Immulon high protein capacity binding) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 50-mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.50. The remaining binding capacity of the sample wells was blocked by incubation for 2 h with 1% BSA in Hepes-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl and 3.5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2). After aspiration of the BSA solution, purified glycocalicin was added to the wells at a concentration of 20 μg/ml and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. After aspiration, the 125I-FXI or 125I-PPACK thrombin was applied to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Each sample and blank well were washed with Hepes-buffered saline seven times for 1 min each, dried, and counted in a 1470 Wallac Wizard gamma counter. Sulfated Tyrosine-containing Peptides—Solid phase synthesis of sulfated-tyrosines in peptides Thr266–Asp287 and Asp269–Pro280 (Table I) was accomplished by the method of Kitagawa et al.

The Effect of Glycocalicin and Mocarhagin Fragments on the Binding of FXI to Activated Platelets—Previous studies have determined that the FXI binding site on platelets is in the GPIbα subunit of the GPIb-IX-V complex for the following reasons: 1) because two GPIbα ligands, SZ2 (a monoclonal antibody agonist the-NH2 terminal of GPIbα) and bovine vWF, inhibit FXI binding to platelets; 2) because FXI was shown by surface plasmon resonance to bind specifically to glycocalicin in a Zn2+-dependent fashion; and 3) because glycocalicin could promote FXI activation by thrombin, another GPIbα ligand (12Baglia F.A.

To determine the binding site for FXI in GPIbα, we utilized mocarhagin, a cobra venom metalloproteinase, that cleaves GPIbα at Glu282–Asp283 to generate a fragment, His1–Glu282, which contains the LRRs and the sulfated tyrosine/anionic sequences Tyr276–Glu282 and excludes the carbohydrate-rich macroglycopeptide. We examined the effect of glycocalicin and the His1–Glu282 fragment on the binding of FXI to activated platelets. Fig. 1 shows that the His1–Glu282 fragment competed for binding sites on FXI-activated platelets with an IC50 similar to that for glycocalicin (10 nm ± 0.65), suggesting that FXI binds to the NH2-terminal portion of glycocalicin. Also, neither of the two synthetic peptides with sulfated tyrosines (Thr266–Asp287 and Asp269–Pro280) had any effect on the binding of FXI to activated platelets, suggesting that FXI does not bind to the anionic domain containing sulfated tyrosines that is utilized for binding thrombin and vWF. FXI Binding to Glycocalicin or the Mocarhagin Fragment in the Presence of ZnCl2—To confirm the notion that FXI is binding to the NH2-terminal region of GPIbα, we performed direct binding experiments in a solid phase assay. Fig. 2 shows that FXI binds to the fragment His 1-Glu 282 with the same Kd app (∼10 nm ± 0.9) as intact glycocalicin in the presence of ZnCl2, whereas in the absence of ZnCl2 no FXI-binding to either glycocalicin or the His1–Glu282 fragment was observed. This confirms the conclusion that the NH2-terminal globular domain of GPIb mediates the binding of FXI to GPIb-IX-Vα. The Effect of the His1–Glu282 Fragment and Sulfated Peptides on the Binding of FXI to Glycocalicin—To further confirm our findings on the effect of the His1–Glu282 fragment and sulfated peptides on FXI binding to activated platelets, we examined their effect on the binding of FXI to glycocalicin in a solid phase assay. Fig. 3 shows that the His1–Glu282 fragment inhibited the binding of FXI to glycocalicin with an IC50 of 20 nm ± 1.8, whereas the sulfated peptides Thr266–Asp287 and Asp269–Pro280 had no effect. The Effect of FXI on the Binding of Thrombin to Glycocalicin—Because both FXI and thrombin bind to the NH2-terminal globular domain of GPIbα and because FXI interacts with thrombin through anion-binding exosite I (35Yun T.H.

The degradation of cytosolic polypeptides is mainly carried out by the proteasome, resulting in 7–9-amino acid long peptides. Further degradation is usually carried out by energy-independent proteases like the tricorn protease from Thermoplasma acidophilum. Recently, a novel tetrahedral-shaped dodecameric 480-kDa aminopeptidase complex (TET) has been described in Haloarcula marismortui that differs from the known ring- or barrel-shaped self-compartmentalizing proteases. This complex is capable of degrading most peptides down to amino acids. We present here the crystal structure of the tetrahedral aminopeptidase homolog FrvX from Pyrococcus horikoshii. The monomer has a typical clan MH fold, as found for example in Aeromonas proteolytica aminopeptidase, containing a dinuclear zinc active center. The quaternary structure is built by dimers with a length of 100 Å that form the edges of the tetrahedron. All 12 active sites are located on the inside of the tetrahedron. Substrate access is granted by pores with a maximal diameter of 10 Å, allowing only small peptides and unfolded proteins access to the active site.

The protein content of all living cells is constantly renewed through synthesis of new proteins and degradation of unneeded or misfolded proteins. This catabolism of proteins is a key cellular function and must be under spatial and temporal control to avert damage to the cell. Because prokaryotes lack membrane-bound compartments, degradation mostly takes place in large macromolecular self-compartmentalizing assemblies whose active sites are arranged in an inner cavity in order to only allow proteolysis of unfolded substrates.In all three kingdoms the degradation of cytosolic proteins is carried out predominantly by the ATP-dependent proteasome or similar energy-dependent proteases that generate oligopeptides 7–9 amino acids long (1Wenzel T.

Electron microscopy analysis of TET at 17 Å resolution showed that it is a 0.4-MDa homododecameric complex with a novel tetrahedral shape that is made up by association of six antiparallel dimers. Contrary to all other self-compartmentalizing proteases described before, the central cavity of this complex is accessible through four narrow channels and through four wider channels. By spectrophoto-metric assays TET was shown to have aminopeptidase activity of broad specificity with a preference for neutral and basic amino acids (10Franzetti B. Schoehn G. Hernandez J.F.

Longer peptides were digested slowly, and cleavage was completely absent for peptides 40 residues long. Furthermore, TET was shown to share significant sequence homology with assigned dinuclear zinc aminopeptidases from bacterial and Archaeal species. Among them is FrvX from the hyperthermophilic Archaea P. horikoshii, which shares 27% sequence identity with TET.FrvX is a polypeptide chain of 353 amino acids with a molecular mass of 39 kDa and a theoretical pI of 5.69. The protein mainly consists of a peptidase domain that belongs to the clan MH, family M42, according to the MEROPS data base (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This domain contains conserved binding sites for two catalytic zinc ions in the active site, bound by His, Asp, Glu, Asp, and His. Such dinuclear metal clusters promote catalysis by providing a site for substrate binding, polarizing the carbonyl group for nucleophilic attack, and stabilizing the transition state of the reaction (12Maher M.J. Ghosh M. Grunden A.M. Menon A.L. Adams M.W. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2771-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Most of the aminopeptidases with such a co-catalytic active site are thought to be zinc enzymes, but typically activity can also be partially or fully observed with other divalent metal ions like Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+. Furthermore, activity can also be present with only one metal ion bound in the active site.For a number of dinuclear aminopeptidases there is structural information available, e.g. for bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (13Burley S.K. David P.R. Taylor A. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), Escherichia coli methionine aminopeptidase (14Roderick S.L. Matthews B.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and A. proteolytica aminopeptidase (ApAp) (15Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure. 1994; 2: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), which define three subfamilies of dinuclear aminopeptidases (16Lowther W.T. Matthews B.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4581-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). All of them share similar folds of the catalytic domain but employ different active site geometries and/or metal ligands. Sequence similarity suggests that FrvX together with all proteases containing a peptidase M42 domain belongs to the ApAp subfamily.Here we have presented the crystal structure of the energy-independent tetrahedral-shaped aminopeptidase complex FrvX from P. horikoshii. This dodecameric protein has the same macromolecular shape as the previously described TET from H. marismortui. The structure of the monomers and the active site strongly resembles the A. proteolytica aminopeptidase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—The gene encoding FrvX was amplified by PCR (17Mullis K. Faloona F. Scharf S. Saiki R. Horn G. Erlich H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51 (Pt. 1): 263-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from P. horikoshii genomic DNA and cloned into a pET-28a vector (Novagen) introducing a N-terminal His6 tag. The protein was expressed in E. coli Rosetta™ (DE3) cells (Novagen). Cells were cultured in Luria Bertani medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 before expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 14 h of induction, cells were harvested, resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02% sodium azide, and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation at 41,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was heat-treated at 88–90 °C for 3 min and centrifuged again at 41,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient from 0–1 M NaCl. The fractions containing FrvX were pooled, concentrated using a Centriprep-30 device (Millipore), and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The protein solution was then loaded on a MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted by a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient. FrvX was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% sodium azide. The purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). It was found to be essential for the quality of the crystals that the first purification step was an ion exchange column. Protein initially purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography only yielded poorly diffracting crystals. Cleavage of the His6 tag using thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) also yielded crystals of much inferior quality. Typical yields were 15 mg/liter pure protein as measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).Crystallization—Hexagonal crystals of FrvX were obtained after 2 days by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Drops were set up by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (8 mg/ml) with 1 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m sodium-citrate, pH 6.1, 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1 m NaCl) and equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution at 18 °C. Typical crystals have an average size of 200 × 50 × 50 μm3. The spacegroup was determined as P63 with cell constants of a = b = 157.9 Å, c = 114.2 Å, with four monomers in the asymmetric unit.Trigonal crystals of lower quality were obtained from protein batches purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as the first purification step and subsequent cleavage of the His6 tag. 2 μl of protein solution (8 mg/ml) were mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (50 mm glycine, pH 3.1, 2% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 1.0 m lithium sulfate) and equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution at 18 °C. Crystals were observed after 3 days and grew to an average size of 200 × 100 × 100 μm3. They belong to spacegroup P31/221 with cell constants of a = b = 160.0 Å, c = 418.2 Å. Only the hexagonal crystals were suitable for structure solution.Data Collection—Prior to data collection, crystals were cryoprotected by raising the polyethylene glycol 400 concentration to 35% (v/v) and flash-cooled in a nitrogen stream at 110 K. High resolution (2.25 Å) native data were collected on beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source in Villigen using a MAR-165 CCD detector (Marresearch, Hamburg, Germany). A single wavelength anomalous dispersion experiment employing the zinc absorption edge was carried out at beamline BW7A at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg Outstation at the Deutsches Elektron Synchrotron in Hamburg using a MAR-165 CCD detector (Marresearch, Hamburg, Germany). Exposure times varied from about 30 s (Deutsches Elektron Synchrotron) to 1 s (Swiss Light Source) for 0.2-degree oscillations. All datasets were integrated and scaled with XDS (19Kabsch W. J. Appl.

However, the resulting crystals were of much inferior quality, exhibiting split Bragg reflections and signs of twinning. During the efforts to improve those crystals, the structures of the Thermotoga maritima (PDB code 1VHO) and B. subtilis (PDB code 1VHE) orthologs became available. Initial phases were then determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (22Vagin A. Teplayakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4120) Google Scholar) employing chain A of aminopeptidase 1VHE from B. subtilis as a search model. Rigid body refinement was followed by NCS averaging and phase extension using CNS software (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54 (Pt. 5): 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar). Automated model building was done by ArpWarp (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). The resulting model was completed using O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47 (Pt. 2): 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out by REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13779) Google Scholar). The data in the outmost resolution shell (2.21–2.09 Å) showed large deviations in a Wilson plot and were excluded from refinement. At this point the model contained one Zn+2 ion/monomer, such as in the original search probe. An anomalous difference Fourier map using the zinc peak dataset revealed a more weakly occupied position of a second Zn2+ ion in the active site of three monomers; these zinc ions were subsequently included in all four subunits. Refinement statistics are given in Table I.The quality of the structure was checked with PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Comparison of three-dimensional structures was effected using DALI. Structure figures were created using the program PYMOL (www.pymol.org).Activity Assay—The aminopeptidase activity of FrvX was examined using aminoacyl-para-nitroanilides as substrates. The reactions were carried out at 90 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnCl2 with 0.5 mm substrate and 2 or 10 μg/ml enzyme. The concentration of product formed was determined by measuring the absorption of released para-nitroaniline at 405 nm (ϵ405 = 10,400 m-1 cm-1) every 5 min up to 30 min.RESULTSStructure Refinement—The four monomers present in the hexagonal asymmetric unit of FrvX comprise residues 6–121 and 133–353 (polypeptide chains B, C, and D) and residues 1–121 and 133–353, as well as four additional residues of the N-terminal His tag (chain A). In all four monomers, residues 122–132, which are part of a solvent-exposed loop, were not visible in the electron density. Altogether, the final model consists of 1357 amino acid residues, 601 water molecules, and 8 zinc cations. Refinement statistics are given in Table I. A Ramachandran plot as defined by Kleywegt and Jones (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1395-1400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) shows 1.5% outliers.Monomer Structure—The monomer fold resembles those found in other MH clan aminopeptidases, e.g. from A. proteolytica (PDB code 1AMP, (29Chevrier B. D'Orchymont H. Schalk C. Tarnus C. Moras D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar)), but is also similar to the related clan MF leucine aminopeptidase from Bos taurus (PDB code 1BPM, (13Burley S.K. David P.R. Taylor A. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)). These two structures have a DALI (30Sander C. Schneider R. Proteins. 1991; 9: 56-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1463) Google Scholar) Z-score/Cα r.m.s. deviations of 23.4/2.6 and 13.2/3.3 Å. The sequence identities are only 17 and 9%, respectively. Much more similar are the deposited but hitherto unpublished structures from B. subtilis (PDB code 1VHO) and T. maritima (PDB code 1VHE), which exhibit Cα-r.m.s. deviations of about 1 Å.The FrvX monomer is composed of two globular α/β domains and has approximate dimensions of 62 × 60 × 47 Å (Fig. 1). The bigger domain (domain I) contains the N-terminal residues 1–72 and the C-terminal amino acids 165–353. The second domain (domain II) is smaller (amino acids 74–164) and less structured. The main feature of domain I is a central eight-stranded β-sheet that is surrounded by α-helices. The concluding two strands on each side of the sheet are antiparallel and rather short, whereas the central four strands are parallel and much longer. The sheet is sandwiched between two groups of α-helices. The first group consists of five helices, including the N-terminal two; the second group is located on the other side of the β-sheet and comprises two short α-helices. In addition, a smaller, three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet is located at the surface of the molecule.Domain two is built of a tilted, six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two very short α-helices. The two domains are connected by two loop regions. Of these, the first extends from a central β-strand of domain I to the second strand of the β-sheet of domain II; the second domain extends from the third strand of the sheet of domain II to the small surface-located β-sheet of domain I. The first link comprises two ligands of one active site zinc ion.The active site is located in the cleft between the two domains that is mainly generated by a large, solvent-exposed loop stabilized by crystal contacts. All catalytic residues are part of domain I.Dinuclear Active Site—Contrary to the search probe 1VHE, the active site contains in the refined FrvX model a second zinc ion (denoted as Zn1) identified by imaginary Fourier maps using reflection data measured at the zinc edge. The catalytic water molecule was identified in the 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc electron density maps in one subunit and subsequently added to all four crystallographically independent monomers. A close-up view of the active site of FrvX is shown in Fig. 2. Both zinc ions are tetrahedrally coordinated and are bridged by Asp-182 and a water molecule. The ion denoted as Zn1 is additionally coordinated by His-323 and Glu-213 and Zn2 by His-68 and Asp-235. It is possible that the two terminal acidic residues Glu-213 and Asp-235 provide a fifth ligand to both zinc ions. Glu-212 forms a hydrogen bond with the water molecule. The distance between the two metal ions is about 3.4 Å. Overall, the active site of FrvX is very similar to the one of the ApAp. The dinuclear metal center has the same symmetric geometry and the same amino acid ligands. An overlay of the metal clusters of FrvX and Aeromonas enzyme reveals only very little change in the position of the ligands and metal ions.Fig. 2Close-up view of the active site. Amino acid side chains are shown as sticks. Atomic colors are as follows: oxygen, red; nitrogen, blue; carbon, gray. Zinc ions and the water molecule are shown as black or red spheres, respectively. The imaginary Fourier map depicted in chicken wire representation is contoured at 18 (blue)and9(orange) S.D. above the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because of the similarity of the active sites of FrvX and ApAp, we suggest that the reaction mechanism of FrvX is similar to the one proposed for ApAp (31Stamper C. Bennett B. Edwards T. Holz R.C. Ringe D. Petsko G. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7035-7046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is mainly based on electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic and crystallographic data (15Chevrier B. Schalk C. D'Orchymont H. Rondeau J.M. Moras D. Tarnus C. Structure. 1994; 2: 283-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 32Bennett B. Holz R.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9837-9846Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33De Paola C.C. Bennett B. Holz R.C. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9048-9053Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond first binds to Zn1, followed by binding of the N-terminal amine group to Zn2. This coordination of the nitrogen atom to Zn2 putatively leads to the break of the interaction between Zn2 and the catalytic water molecule and, hence, transfer of the latter to Zn1. Glu-212 (Glu-151 in ApAp) is thought to act as general base, inducing the formation of the nucleophilic hydroxide ion, which attacks the carbonyl group leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. The last and rate-limiting step is consequently the break of the peptide bond involving a proton transfer from Glu-212 to the new N-terminal amine group of the leaving peptide.It is well known and accepted that some dinuclear peptidases are at least partially active with only one metal bound in the active site. For the Aeromonas enzyme it was shown that the two zinc ions possess different affinities for their binding site and also a different effect on enzymatic activity (34Bennett B. Holz R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1923-1933Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 35Prescott J.M. Wagner F.W. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If only the high affinity site (Zn1) is occupied, the protein still retains about 80% of its activity. It has been proposed that in the absence of a metal ion bound in the low affinity site (Zn2), the N-terminal amine group is bound by Asp-179 (Asp-235 in FrvX).For FrvX, an anomalous difference Fourier calculation of data measured at the zinc absorption edge provides insight into the occupancy level of both metal ions (Fig. 2). Interestingly, in all four monomers embodied in the asymmetric unit the Zn2 site possesses the higher occupancy. This indicates that contrary to ApAp, in FrvX the Zn2 site exhibits higher affinity toward a zinc ion and consequently is more important for enzyme activity than the Zn1 site. This finding may suggest that the roles of Zn1 and Zn2 in FrvX are inverted. Whether FrvX is active with only one metal ion bound and, if this is the case, which zinc binding site is vital for the reaction to occur needs further investigation.Dodecamer Structure—Gel filtration experiments indicated that FrvX is a dodecamer in solution. Similar experiments (data not shown) employing homologs from Lactococcus lactis (Swiss-Prot accession number Q48677) and Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Swiss-Prot accession number Q8RCI7) hinted at dimeric and monomeric quaternary structures, respectively. The self rotation function of FrvX in the trigonal and hexagonal crystal forms revealed the presence of tetrahedral particles, which was confirmed by the high resolution structure of the hexagonal space group on which we will focus in the following.The four subunits embodied in the asymmetric unit build up the physiological tetrahedral-shaped dodecamer by application of the crystallographic 3-fold axis located at (x = 1/3, y = 2/3, z). Each edge of the tetrahedron has a length of about 100 Å and is built by a dimer (chains A and D in the asymmetric unit). Chains B and C each form half of an edge; these edges are then completed by the symmetry-equivalent subunits generated by the crystallographic 3-fold axis (Fig. 3). The intersubunit contacts involve rather extended surfaces: formation of the “edge dimer” from monomers buries 3300 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface, and the AC and AB interfaces measure about 2300 Å2 each. Contact residues are indicated in Fig. 4. The contacts are of polar and non-polar nature.Fig. 3The dodecameric tetrahedron. Schematic representation, zinc ions are shown as black spheres. A, top stereo view down the crystallographic 3-fold axis. B, side stereo view, approximately along a non-crystallographic 3-fold axis.

https://openalex.org/W1980440549,"Recent reports indicate that NAD(P)H oxidase 1 (Nox1) mRNA undergoes alternative splicing, producing a short transcript (NOH-1S) encoding a novel H+ channel. Although the H+ transport properties of NOH-1S-transfected cells resemble those of many cells, the production of a NOH-1S protein was never documented. We characterized Nox1 transcripts in colon-derived cells and present evidence that mRNA splicing does not produce NOH-1S; rather, NOH-1S appears to be an artifact of template switching during cDNA synthesis. The NOH-1S transcript was not observed by Northern blotting, despite claims of its abundance based on RNase protection assays. The shortened cDNA was generated by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, but not by thermally stable reverse transcriptase under conditions that produce full-length Nox1. Analysis of shortened cDNAs detected NOH-1S sequence and other variants that differ at the alleged splice junction site. Although no appropriate RNA splicing sites were found within Nox1 to account for NOH-1S formation, we found repetitive sequence elements bordering the deleted region, which could promote intramolecular template switching during cDNA synthesis. Template switching was confirmed in vitro, where the deleted cDNA was generated by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase from a synthetic, full-length Nox1 RNA template. A survey of the expressed sequence tags database suggests that similar switching phenomena occur between repetitive elements in other Nox family transcripts, indicating such cloning artifacts are common. In contrast, genuine RNA splicing does account for another Nox1 transcript lacking the entire exon 11, which is abundant in colon cells but encodes a protein incapable of supporting superoxide production.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 769-787Google Scholar). The phagocytic NADPH oxidase (phox) consists of the membrane-bound cytochrome b558, several cytosolic factors (p47phox, p67phox, p40phox), and the small GTPase Rac2. Cytochrome b558 is a complex of two proteins: the flavin and heme-binding glycoprotein gp91phox and p22phox. Recently, several novel gp91phox homologs have been discovered (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S.

Although several studies have demonstrated ROS production by these Nox family gp91phox homologs, their exact physiological functions remain unknown. Superoxide production is accompanied by a robust intracellular H+ production resulting from oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ and H+ and from the activation of the NADPH-regenerating hexose monophosphate shunt. Phagocytic cells have at least three mechanisms for removal of H+: Na+-H+ exchange, H+-ATPase, and electrogenic H+ transport (10Lukács G.L. Kapus A. Nanda A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C3-C14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of electrogenic H+ transport in phagocytes is still debated; some evidence suggests that gp91phox could act as a proton translocator (11Henderson L.M. Banting G. Chappell J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5909-5916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Bánfi B. Schrenzel J. Nusse O. Lew D.P. Ligeti E. Krause K.H. J. Exp.

J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) demonstrated that cells transfected with gp91phox or the N-terminal portion of this protein acquire arachidonate-dependent H+ transport activity. This arachidonate-dependent activity appears to involve three histidine residues within the third transmembrane domain of gp91phox; these features are conserved in other Nox family homologs. The notion that gp91phox functions as a proton channel was supported further by studies on the gp91phox homolog Nox1, where a putative alternatively spliced product (NOH-1S; NADPH oxidase homolog-1 short; GenBank accession no. NM013954) was shown to have H+ channel activity (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). That work, representing the first report of cloning of a mammalian H+ channel, suggested the H+ transport function could be dissociated from NADPH oxidase activity as a distinct molecular entity. The sequence encoding NOH-1S, originally derived from the database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST), was proposed to result from an unusual intra-exonic splicing event, involving only a portion of exon 5 spliced to the exon 14 sequence. The putative product, which was not detected at the protein level, consists of four transmembrane domains and a short cytoplasmic tail; the recombinant protein, when expressed ectopically in HEK 293 cells, exhibited the properties of voltage-gated H+ channels. These results agreed with previous observations on the truncated, N-terminal fragment of gp91phox (17Henderson L.M. Thomas S. Banting G. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this study, we characterized Nox1 mRNA transcripts in normal colon and cancerous colon epithelial cells, where the Nox1 gene is expressed abundantly. We show that the mRNA transcript for NOH-1S is not synthesized from the Nox1 gene but is instead an artifactual product of cDNA synthesis. We attribute this result to the phenomenon of intramolecular template switching between repetitive sequence elements during cDNA synthesis. Our observations indicate that although the dbEST represents a rich source of novel transcript variants, these data should be viewed cautiously because of the frequent occurrence of such cloning artifacts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Nox1 gene encodes another genuine spliced variant of Nox1 that is abundant in colon cells but is not functional because of the absence of exon 11-encoded sequence. Cell Culture—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, unless indicated otherwise. Caco2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. HT29 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm, sodium pyruvate, and 100 μm nonessential amino acids. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from Caco2 and HT29 cells (15 μg), separated electrophoretically on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were probed at 65 °C with a radiolabeled human Nox1 cDNA fragment (Amersham Biosciences) in Quickhyb hybridization solution (Stratagene) following standard hybridization protocols. The 32P-radiolabeled probe was prepared with a Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). In other experiments, pre-made human gastrointestinal Northern blots (Clontech) were probed under the same conditions as detailed above. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For RT-PCR experiments, 1 μg of mRNA from Caco2 cells, HT29 cells, or normal human colon (Invitrogen) was transcribed into cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer and the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase-based cDNA cycle™ kit (1 h at 42 °C) or using the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR kit (1 h at 60 °C; Invitrogen). PCRs were performed with a High Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) using the following Nox1-specific primers: primer 1, 5′-ATGGGAAACTGGGTGGTTAAC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CACTGTTGGTGTTATATGGGGA-3′; primer 3, 5′-GCTGTTCACACTGGATAAGACC-3′; primer 4, 5′-TCAAAAATTTTCTTTGTTGA-3′. The cDNA templates were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 50 s, 55 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 2 min). The PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO or pCR4-TOPO TA-cloning vectors (Invitrogen), and randomly selected clones were sequenced with vector specific primers. In Vitro Transcription—A 2267-bp-long fragment of the human Nox1 (colon) cDNA was amplified with primers 1 and 3 and cloned into pCR4-TOPO TA-cloning vector. RNA was transcribed with 30 units T7 RNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) using 1 μg of linearized template DNA from this construct. After 1 h at 37 °C, the template DNA was digested by DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and the RNA was purified by the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed as detailed above, using the cDNA cycle™ kit (Invitrogen) for cDNA synthesis at 42 °C and primers 1 and 2 for the PCR. RNase Protection Assays—RNase protection assays were performed as described by Bánfi et al. (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A radiolabeled 3′-terminal NOH-1S antisense probe was synthesized from a BanI-digested NOH-1S cDNA (I.M.A.G.E. clone 900560, Research Genetics) using T3 RNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) and [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting transcript produces a 407-base probe, of which 374 bases correspond to the 3′-portion of NOH-1S (starting at nucleotide 241 relative to the start codon). Synthetic, full-length Nox1 RNA was transcribed and purified as above and used to anneal to the NOH-1S probe at 42 °C for 16 h. The resulting hybrids were treated with RNase A and T1 mixtures for 30 min at 37 °C using the RPA III™ RNase protection assay kit (Ambion). The protected products were analyzed by autoradiography after electrophoresis on 6% acrylamide/urea/TBE gels (Invitrogen). Database Searches—Database searches were performed in the dbEST and the unfinished high throughput genomic sequences using the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST). Cell Transfections and Superoxide Production Assays—For transfection studies, the complete coding sequence of human Nox1, Nox1v, p51nox1/Noxa1 (19Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and p41nox1/Noxo1-α (19Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and p22phox were cloned into pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at 400,000 cells/well (HEK 293 cells) or 120,000 cells/well (COS-7 cells) in 6-well dishes 24 h prior to transfection. HEK 293 cell transfections were performed in serum-free medium using 9 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) prepared in complexes with plasmid DNAs (0.8 μg of Nox1, Nox1v, or pcDNA3.1 (control) plasmid, plus 0.8 μg each of p41nox1/Noxo1-α and p51nox1/Noxa1 plasmids), using the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The cells were fed at 5 h post-transfection, followed by harvesting 72 h post-transfection. COS-7 cell transfections were as above, but also included p22phox pCDNA3.1 plasmid DNA, using 0.6 μg of each plasmid. These cells were assayed 48 h after transfection. Trypsinized cells were assayed for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated superoxide release by chemiluminescence methods using the Diogenes reagent, as described previously (19Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Witta J. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20006-20010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). For Nox protein detection by Western blotting, the Nox1 or Nox1v cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 V5 His TOPO plasmid vector (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were transfected with 1 μg of Nox1, Nox1v, or pcDNA3.1 (control) plasmid, along with 1 μg of p22phox plasmid. The cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection using cell scrapers and the membrane fractions were probed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal anti-V5 peptide antibody (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer's protocols. Exonic Organization of the Nox1 gene—Based on a genomic DNA database search, Bánfi et al. (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) concluded that the NOH-1/Nox1 gene was located on Xq22 and consisted of 14 exons. They indicated that the first 13 exons are of comparable size and are homologous to the 13 exons of gp91phox and that the 14th exon, containing 99 nucleotides, was unique to the Nox1 gene. They suggested that the generation of NOH-1S involved splicing of an intra-exonic site in exon 5 with the sequence in exon 14, which would encode a unique C-terminal portion of NOH-1S. Our reevaluation of genomic and corresponding cDNA sequences deposited in the human genomic database indicates that the Nox1 gene encompasses only 13 exons. Fig. 1a provides a revised exon map of Nox1, which was deduced from a BLAST-based alignment of the full-length cDNA sequence with a contiguous genomic Nox1 DNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number HsX_11808). In this revised genomic map, the last exon, exon 13, consists of 741 nucleotides and includes a 3′-terminal 99 nucleotides that previously represented exon 14 (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the putative NOH-1S transcript would involve the use of intra-exonic splice donor and splice acceptor sites within exon 5 and exon 13, respectively. RNA splicing is a precisely regulated process involving strict adherence to the “GT-AG” rule (20Lewin B. Genes VI. Oxford University Press, New York1997: 885-920Google Scholar, 21Burset M. Seledtsov I.A. Solovyev V.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), even in those relatively rare examples where intra-exonic splicing occurs (22Vibe-Pedersen K. Magnusson S. Baralle F.E. FEBS Lett. 1986; 207: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Chang M.S. McNinch J. Basu R. Shutter J. Hsu R.Y. Perkins C. Mar V. Suggs S. Welcher A. Li L. Lu H. Bartley T. Hunt P. Martin F. Samal B. Bogenberger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 511-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We screened exon 5 and exon 13 of the Nox1 gene for suitable intra-exonic splice donor and acceptor sites corresponding to the proposed splice sites in NOH-1S. Using splice site predictions by neural network analysis (www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools) with low donor and acceptor site cutoff scores (0.40), we were unable to locate any appropriate splice sites corresponding to the proposed regions of NOH-1S. Demonstration of Nox1 Expression by Northern Blot Analysis—The Nox1 gene is expressed abundantly in the colon and to a lesser extent in the uterus, the prostate, and proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells (3Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). To characterize the transcripts originating from the Nox1 gene, we studied Nox1 mRNA expression by Northern blot analysis on a gastrointestinal mRNA panel; various isolated portions of the colon were represented, as well as RNAs from two colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Caco2 and HT29). The cDNA probe encompassed a major 5′-fragment (409 nucleotides) of the Nox1 mRNA and included most of the NOH-1S sequence (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that one major band of ∼2.5 kb, corresponding to the full-length Nox1 mRNA transcript, was recognized in all lanes, although no signal was detected at the expected size for NOH-1S (∼0.50 kb). We observed that Nox1 expression could be significantly induced by treating Caco2 cells with 1 α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or interferon-γ (24Geiszt M. Lekstrom K. Brenner S. Hewitt S.M. Dana R. Malech H.L. Leto T.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); however, the NOH-1S messenger RNA was still not detected in induced Caco2 cells. These results indicate that the NOH-1S mRNA species was either absent or was below the detection limits of the Northern blot method, although the RNase protection experiments by Bánfi et al. (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) suggested that NOH-1S and NOH-1L are expressed in comparable amounts in normal colon and colon carcinoma lines. Detection of NOH-1S by RT-PCR—To examine the possibility of low level NOH-1S expression (i.e. below Northern analysis detection limits), we used RT-PCR to amplify NOH-1S transcripts from colon RNA. Using AMV reverse transcriptase and primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-region of the NOH-1S cDNA (primers 1 and 3), as described previously (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we were able to amplify products corresponding to the expected size of NOH-1S mRNA (Fig. 2A). We also amplified similar sized products from Caco2 and HT29 cells (data not shown). After randomly sequencing selected clones derived from these PCR products, we discovered several novel sequences with extensive variations within the alleged intra-exonic spliced region of NOH-1S (Fig. 2B), whereas the sequences flanking the alleged splice site were virtually identical. Specifically, we identified five unique sequence variations (Fig. 2B), including several clones that matched the EST clone AA493362 (originally described as NOH-1S). Repeated sequencing of both DNA strands excluded the possibility that the sequence variations were caused by sequencing errors. Interestingly, a nucleotide BLAST search in dbEST using NOH-1S as a query sequence identified an additional sequence variant (AW450431; Fig. 2B, sequence 6) that was identical to NOH-1S except for the region indicated in Fig. 2B. Note that several of these sequences (sequences 2-4) contain longer stretches of exon 5 sequence than was observed in the NOH-1S transcript (sequence 1), indicating that these sequence variations were not caused by low fidelity transcriptional errors during amplification of the NOH-1S cDNA. These data, together with the negative Northern blot result, strongly suggest that NOH-1S is not a novel splice variant of Nox1 but represents an artifact of the cDNA cloning process. In these experiments, we performed the cDNA synthesis at 42 °C using the AMV reverse transcriptase enzyme, as originally described (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that NOH-1S is a product of inaccurate cDNA synthesis, we used a different reverse transcriptase for cDNA synthesis which performs at higher temperatures. Using the heat-stable ThermoScript™ reverse transcriptase system for cDNA synthesis at 60 °C, we could not amplify the NOH-1S from colon RNA preparations, although the full-length, 2.3-kb-long Nox1 cDNA was obtained (using two different primer pairs) in good yield despite its considerably larger size (Fig. 2C). Thus, NOH-1S cDNA appears to be a unique product of AMV reverse transcriptase. These experiments also establish that errors in the PCR amplification were not responsible for the generation of the NOH-1S product. Repetitive Sequence Elements and Their Role in NOH-1S cDNA Synthesis—Although exons 5 and 13 do not contain suitable splice sites that account for NOH-1S formation by RNA splicing, we observed more than one repetitive sequence element at the boundaries of the deleted region, which would promote intramolecular template switching during cDNA synthesis (25Mader R.M. Schmidt W.M. Sedivy R. Rizovski B. Braun J. Kalipciyan M. Exner M. Steger G.G. Mueller M.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 2001; 137: 422-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and can account for the heterogeneity of the Nox1-derived short forms shown in Fig. 2B. The basis for such a template switching mechanism is illustrated in the cases of two deleted Nox1 transcripts that were already deposited in dbEST (Fig. 3A). To explore directly the possibility of intramolecular template switching, we cloned a 2.2-kb portion of the full-length Nox1 cDNA, produced a synthetic mRNA template in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase, and then synthesized the cDNA at 42 °C using AMV reverse transcriptase. After PCR amplification, we identified two high yield products (Fig. 3B): the original full-length Nox1 cDNA copy and a product that corresponds to the size of NOH-1S. Sequencing of the short PCR product revealed a NOH-1S sequence variant corresponding to sequence 2 (Fig. 2B). This experiment shows that NOH-1S can be derived spontaneously from the full-length Nox1 transcript in the absence of any splicing machinery and proves that NOH-1S cDNA formation involves intramolecular template switching between repetitive sequence elements within the RNA template. GenBank™ searches of the dbEST revealed that internally deleted forms of other gp91phox homologs were also deposited in this database. Using the cDNAs of mouse NADP(H) oxidase 4/renal oxidase (Nox4/Renox) and the rat dual oxidase 2/thyroid oxidase 2 (Duox2/Thox2) as query sequences, we identified internally deleted forms of both sequences (AW107048, AW012126, and AW259939 for NOX4 and AW920088 for Duox2). Because a partial sequence of the mouse Renox (Nox4) gene was already deposited in the high throughput genomic sequences database, we confirmed that these deletions in the Nox4 cDNA also occurred within exons and in the absence of appropriate splice signals, arguing against an alternative RNA splicing mechanism. We examined the specific deleted regions in full-length Nox4 and Duox2 cDNA sequences, and, interestingly, both sequences also contain repetitive elements within the boundaries of the deleted regions (Fig. 3C, boxed sequences). RNase Protection Assays Using Synthetic RNA—RNase protection was the only other experimental approach used besides RT-PCR to support the model of RNA splicing as the basis for NOH-1S synthesis (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Because we showed that cDNA synthesis by AMV reverse transcriptase spontaneously generates deleted Nox1 products from full-length templates (Fig. 3B), we reevaluated the RNase protection assay described by Bánfi et al. (18Bánfi B. Maturana A. Jaconi S. Arnaudeau S. Laforge T. Sinha B. Ligeti E. Demaurex N. Krause K.H. Science. 2000; 287: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In these experiments, we prepared a radiolabeled riboprobe from the 3′-end of NOH-1S, similar to this previous study, and examined the RNase protection patterns resulting from hybridization to the synthetic, full-length RNA transcribed in vitro from Nox1 cDNA. Fig. 4 shows that hybridization of this single, undeleted transcript provides RNase protection resulting in a mixture of two major fragments: one that corresponded to hybridization of the probe up to the boundary of the deletion site (235 nucleotides), which was predicted for detection of the full-length transcript, and another larger fragment (30"
https://openalex.org/W2042958257,"Cell survival signaling of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway was influenced by a change in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) for over 2 h via the regulation of a Ser/Thr phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2Ac (PP2Ac), in rat myocardiac H9c2 cells. Akt was down-regulated when [Ca2+]i was elevated by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, but was up-regulated when it was suppressed by 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA-AM), a cell permeable Ca2+ chelator. The inactivation of Akt was well correlated with the susceptibility to oxidant-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. To investigate the mechanism of the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Akt via the regulation of PP2A, we examined the transcriptional regulation of PP2Acα in H9c2 cells with Ca2+ modulators. Transcription of the PP2Acα gene was increased by thapsigargin but decreased by BAPTA-AM. The promoter activity was examined and the cAMP response element (CRE) was found responsible for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of PP2Acα. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein increased with thapsigargin but decreased with BAPTA-AM. A long term change of [Ca2+]i regulates PP2Acα gene transcription via CRE, resulting in a change in the activation status of Akt leading to an altered susceptibility to apoptosis. Cell survival signaling of the Akt/protein kinase B pathway was influenced by a change in the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) for over 2 h via the regulation of a Ser/Thr phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2Ac (PP2Ac), in rat myocardiac H9c2 cells. Akt was down-regulated when [Ca2+]i was elevated by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, but was up-regulated when it was suppressed by 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester (BAPTA-AM), a cell permeable Ca2+ chelator. The inactivation of Akt was well correlated with the susceptibility to oxidant-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells. To investigate the mechanism of the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Akt via the regulation of PP2A, we examined the transcriptional regulation of PP2Acα in H9c2 cells with Ca2+ modulators. Transcription of the PP2Acα gene was increased by thapsigargin but decreased by BAPTA-AM. The promoter activity was examined and the cAMP response element (CRE) was found responsible for the Ca2+-dependent regulation of PP2Acα. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein increased with thapsigargin but decreased with BAPTA-AM. A long term change of [Ca2+]i regulates PP2Acα gene transcription via CRE, resulting in a change in the activation status of Akt leading to an altered susceptibility to apoptosis. Calcium (Ca2+) plays a signaling role in many important cellular functions, such as fertilization, embryonic pattern formation, differentiation, proliferation, contraction, secretion, and metabolism (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). The versatility of the Ca2+-signaling mechanism in terms of speed, amplitude and spatio-temporal patterning enables elevations of Ca2+ to regulate many processes of cell activity. Ca2+ exhibits cross-talk between a variety of signaling pathways (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Ca2+ affects the protein kinase A pathway by regulating the metabolism of cAMP. It also activates nitric-oxide (NO) synthase to generate NO, which in turn activates the cGMP pathway through the activation of guanylyl cyclase. The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis (o-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra (acetoxymethyl) ester; CRE, cAMP response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; CaMK, calmodulin kinase; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. and Ca2+/calmodulin/calmodulin kinase (CaMK) pathways are also controlled by Ca2+ (1Berridge M.J.

Signal. 2002; 14: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a cellular Ca2+ overload or the perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization can cause cytotoxicity and trigger apoptosis or necrosis (3Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. 2003; 5: 552-565Crossref Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 4Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Ferrari D. Chami M. Szabadkai G. Magalhaes P.J. Virgilio F. Pozzan T. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8619-8627Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Under such circumstances, various Ca2+-dependent signaling cascades with kinases and phosphatases directly or indirectly influence cellular signaling. Protein kinase C family has been proposed to play an important role in the Ca2+-mediated signaling of apoptosis (5Murriel C.L. Mochly-Rosen D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 420: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Calcineurin/PP2B, a Ca2+-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatase (6Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), also appears to be involved in apoptosis (7Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Together, these findings show that Ca2+ has a pivotal role in the regulatory mechanism of signaling pathways in cell survival and death, although the precise mechanism of Ca2+-dependent cross-talk has not been fully clarified. Akt/protein kinase B is a pleckstrin homology domain-containing Ser/Thr kinase (8Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Akt is presently recognized as a cell survival or an antiapoptotic cellular signaling mediator. Akt is activated through a growth factor receptor-mediated activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). With growth factor signals, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane and is activated through phosphorylation at Ser-473 and Thr-308 by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) or integrin-linked kinase (9Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Akt can phosphorylate Bad, caspase-9, and forkhead-related transcription factors, leading to their inactivation and to enhanced cell survival (8Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 9Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Inhibitor of nuclear factor κB (IκB) kinase is also phosphorylated by Akt leading to an up-regulation of its activity and resulting in a promotion of the nuclear factor κB (NFκB)-mediated inhibition of apoptosis (8Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 11Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfefer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B.

Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) Akt has been found to be involved in cell death following the withdrawal of extracellular signaling factors, oxidative and osmotic stress, irradiation, treatment with drugs and ischemic stress (10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). However, in spite that a variety of cellular stressors influence cells through Ca2+ signaling, the number of studies on Akt signaling and Ca2+ is limited. As for Akt, Ca2+-dependent activation was reported in several studies (13Yano S. Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. Nature. 1998; 396: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 14Huber M. Hughes M.R. Krystal G. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there was a report that the activation of Akt is independent of Ca2+ (15Conus N.M. Hemmings B.A. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that Akt was suppressed by an elevation of [Ca2+]i in myocardiac H9c2 cells overexpressing the calreticulin gene (16Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the cells overexpressing calreticulin, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was up-regulated by Ca2+ to decrease the phosphorylation level of Akt, and the inactivated status of Akt was well correlated with the susceptibility to apoptosis in H9c2 cells under conditions for differentiation induced by retinoic acid. Collectively, these results suggest that the Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism of Akt signaling may be important to a variety of apoptotic signaling mechanisms, although how has not been fully clarified. In the present study, to investigate the mechanism of the Ca2+-dependent regulation of Akt signaling, we examined the influence of a change of [Ca2+]i on susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell injury and on the Akt signaling pathway in myocardiac H9c2 cells. We show that the Ca2+-dependent regulation of PP2Acα gene transcription is controlled through the cAMP responsive element (CRE), resulting in a change in the activation status of Akt leading to an altered susceptibility to apoptosis. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and phospho-Akt (Thr-308), CRE-binding protein (CREB), and phospho-CREB (Ser-133) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibody against Sp1 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The reagents used in the study were all of high grade and from Sigma or Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Cell Culture—H9c2 cells from embryonic rat heart (16Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 17Hescheler J. Meyer R. Plant S. Krautwurst D. Rosenthal W. Schultz G. Circ. Res. 1991; 69: 1476-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1446). H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Before reaching confluence, the cells were split, and plated at low density in culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Measurement of Cytoplasmic Free Ca2+—The cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, was measured using Fura-2-AM essentially as described previously (16Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2-AM (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 20 min in Earle's balanced salt solution (EBSS) in the presence of 0.01% pluronic acid F-127. After four washes with EBSS, the cover glass was positioned in a quartz cuvette containing 3.5 ml of fresh EBSS at a 45° angle to both excitation and emission light paths. The fura-2 fluorescence was determined at 37 °C using a spectrofluorophotometer operating at an emission wavelength of 505 nm with an excitation wavelength of 340 and 380 nm. The maximal signal (Rmax) was obtained by adding ionomycin at a final concentration of 4 μm. Then the minimal signal (Rmin) was obtained by adding EGTA at a final concentration of 7.5 mm, followed by Tris-free base to a final concentration of 30 mm, to increase the pH to 8.3. R is the ratio (F1/F2) of the fluorescence of Ex 340 nm, Em 505 nm (F1) to that of Ex 380 nm, Em 505 nm (F2). The actual Ca2+ concentration was calculated as Kd X (R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R) with the Kd equal to 224 nm (18Grynkiewcz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release Assay—After 4 h of treatment with 5 μm thapsigargin or 10 μm BAPTA-AM or not, cells were incubated with 75 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 0–120 min. The LDH activity was assayed by using a MTX LDH kit (Kyokuto Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50 μl of supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate, then 50 μl of coloring reagent was added and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After 100 μl of stop solution was added, absorbance was measured at 560 nm with a microplate reader. The LDH release was shown as a rate of LDH released in the medium to total cellular LDH. TUNEL Assay—Apoptosis was detected flow cytometrically by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method (19Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Benn-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9167) Google Scholar) using an ApopTag Plus Fluorescein in situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Serologicals, Norcross, GA). Briefly, cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol, treated with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 1 h, and then with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antidigoxigenin for 1 h at room temperature, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The fluorescence intensity was measured at 530 nm using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Northern Blot Analysis—The full-length rat PP1α catalytic subunit and PP2A catalytic α cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. Kunimi Kikuchi (Hokkaido University, Japan) (20Kitamura K. Mizuno Y. Sasaki A. Yasui A. Tsuiki S. Kikuchi K. J. Biochem. 1991; 109: 307-310PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kitagawa Y. Tahira T. Ikeda I. Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 951: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A PstI-SmaI fragment of 600 bp and EcoRI-PvuII fragment of 680 bp were prepared from the cDNAs of PP1αc and PP2Acα, respectively, and used as cDNA probes. The probes were labeled with 32P using a Random Primer Labeling kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan). The isolation of cytoplasmic RNA and Northern blotting were essentially performed as described before (16Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Isolated RNAs (10 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.6 m formaldehyde, transferred to a nylon membrane, and then hybridized with 32P-labeled probes. Autoradiographed membranes were analyzed using a BAS5000 bioimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured cells were harvested and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol including protease inhibitors (20 μm amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm pepstatin, and 50 μm leupeptin)). The supernatants obtained on centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min were used in subsequent experiments. Protein samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described (22Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Mihara M. Shimizu K. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9629-9634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20. The blots were coupled with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed, and then developed using the ECL chemiluminescence delection kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Akt Activity Assay—Akt acitivity was assayed using an Akt assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Akt was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using the anti-Akt antibody, and then the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in an assay mixture containing an Akt substrate, GSK-3α/β fusion protein. Phosphorylated proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane to detect phosphorylated GSK-3α/β using an anti-phosphorylated GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/9) antibody. Protein Phosphatase Assay—Protein Ser/Thr phosphatase activity was assayed photometrically using Ser/Thr phosphatase assay kit 1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), according to the manufacturer's directions. The activity was assayed in the presence or absence of 10 nm okadaic acid, and the okadaic acid-sensitive activity was estimated as PP2A-specific activity. The phosphopeptide (RK(pT)IRR) was used as a phosphatase substrate. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Pierce). Generation of Luciferase Reporter Constructs—A ∼1.6-kb fragment of rat PP2Acα gene promoter (-1350 to +258) (23Kitagawa Y. Shima H. Sasaki K. Nagao M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was amplified with rat genome by PCR using Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The primers used are as follows; a forward primer (5′-GATCTCAGGTACTTTCTTCCGGAACACTAG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GTCCAGCTCCTTGGTGAACAACTTC-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pUC18 to obtain pUC18-pro-PP2Ac. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by sequencing with an ALFexpress II system (Amersham Biosciences). pUC18-pro-PP2Ac was digested with HindIII, and the resulting fragment containing the promoter region from -1209 to +258 was inserted into the HindIII site of the reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Stratagene) to give pGL3-pro-PP2Ac. To generate deleted mutants of the luciferase reporter construct, pGL3-pro-PP2Ac was digested with SacI and XhoI, and deletion mutants were made using a deletion kit for kilo sequence (Takara Biomedicals). Site-directed Mutagenesis for Luciferase Vectors—In vitro mutagenesis was performed with pGL3-pro-PP2Ac-del (-279 to +258) and del (-145 to +258) as templates by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides used are as follows: GC box (-155), 5′-CCCTCCCCGCGGGAGGACCACAACCCAAAAGCGAAGCCACTTCC-3′; CRE (-26), 5′-CCTGACGCCGGCGTGTGGTCACCACGCCGGGCGGCCGCCATTAC-3′. The nucleotide sequences were confirmed by sequencing with an ALFexpress II system (Amersham Biosciences). Luciferase Activity Assay—Each vector was transfected into H9c2 cells by using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with thapsigargin (5 μm) or BAPTA-AM (10 μm), or left untreated for the periods indicated in the text. Then luciferase activity was assayed with cellular extracts by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) for the GC box and CRE was performed as described previously (24Muroya T. Ihara Y. Ikeda S. Yasuoka C. Miyahara Y. Urata Y. Kondo T. Kohno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 309: 905-910Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then annealed to double-strand oligonucleotides. Specific oligonucleotides for the GC box and CRE were prepared according to the nucleotide sequences of the rat PP2Acα promoter region. Oligonucleotides used are as follows: GC box (-155), 5′-CGGGAGGACCACGCCCCAAAAGCGAAGC-3′; GC box (-155)-Mt, 5′-CGGGAGGACCACAACCCAAAAGCGAAGC-3′; CRE (-26), 5′-GACGCCGGCCTGACGTCACCACGCC-3′; CRE (-26)-Mt, 5′-GACGCCGGCCTGTGGTCACCACGCC -3′. Binding reactions were carried out in 15 μl of reaction mixture (25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol) containing 10 μg of nuclear extract, and 25 ng of labeled oligonucleotide. For the supershift assay, specific antibodies were added to the reaction mixture during the 30-min binding reaction. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—After treatment with 5 μm thapsigargin or 10 μm BAPTA-AM for 2 h, cells incubated on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc) were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. Cells were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. They were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with antiphospho-CREB (Ser-133) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS four times and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 30 min in a dark room. The immunoreactive signals were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Elevation of [Ca2+]i Gradually Accelerates Cell Damage and Apoptosis in H9c2 Cells—To modify the level of [Ca2+]i in H9c2 cells, the cells were treated with 5 μm thapsigargin (25Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar), an inhibitor for sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase to increase [Ca2+]i, or with 10 μm BAPTA-AM (26Pan Z. Bhat M.B. Nieminen A.-L. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32257-32263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), a cell permeable Ca2+ chelator to decrease [Ca2+]i, for 0–4 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, with thapsigargin, [Ca2+]i shows a transient increase within the first 10 min. It then decreases to the basal level till 30 min, but again increases and retains elevated until 120 min, before gradually decreasing to the initial level. In contrast, with BAPTA-AM, [Ca2+]i shows a continuous lowering during the treatment. To investigate the influence of the long term change of [Ca2+]i on susceptibility to oxidative stress-induced cell injury, cells were treated with Ca2+ modulators (i.e. thapsigargin and BAPTA-AM) for 4 h then exposed to 75 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 0–120 min, and cell damage was examined at predetermined times using the LDH release assay as described in the methods. In Fig. 1B, the release of LDH by H2O2 was observed only at 120 min in the medium of untreated cells. However, the release by H2O2 was initially observed at 60 min and increased at 120 min in the cells treated with thapsigargin. In contrast, BAPTA-AM treatment completely suppressed the release of LDH by H2O2 throughout the 120 min. Next, to investigate whether apoptosis is involved in the mechanism of thapsigargin-induced cell damage, cells were treated with Ca2+ modulators for 4 h then exposed to H2O2 (75 μm) for 2 h, and apoptosis was examined. Fig. 1C shows that TUNEL-positive fluorescence intensity was increased slightly by H2O2 (upper), but was significantly enhanced after the pretreatment with thapsigargin (middle). In contrast, no change was observed in the fluorescent intensity of the BAPTA-AM-treated cells with or without H2O2 (lower). Collectively, these results indicate that the susceptibility to apoptosis was enhanced with a long term elevation of [Ca2+]i, but was suppressed with the lowering of [Ca2+]i in the cells under oxidative stress with H2O2, suggesting that the continuous change of [Ca2+]i influences the susceptibility to apoptosis. The Long Term Change of [Ca2+]i Influences Akt Signaling in H9c2 Cells—To know the role of [Ca2+]i in cell survival signaling, we focused on the effect of Ca2+ modulators on Akt signaling. Previously, we found that the Akt signaling pathway is responsible for the cytoprotective mechanism in H9c2 cells under conditions of stress such as serum starvation with retinoic acid (16Kageyama K. Ihara Y. Goto S. Urata Y. Toda G. Yano K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19255-19264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide (27Murata H. Ihara Y. Nakamura H. Yodoi J. Sumikawa K. Kondo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50226-50233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Although elevations in Ca2+ act as a signal, a prolonged increase in the concentration of Ca2+ can be lethal (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Moreover, cell signaling molecules including transcription factors are activated differentially by the amplitude and duration of the response to Ca2+ (28Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). In the present study, H9c2 cells were treated with Ca2+ modulators such as thapsigargin (5 μm) and BAPTA-AM (10 μm) for over 2 h to induce a long term change of [Ca2+]i. After the treatments, the phosphorylation levels of Ser-473 and Thr-308 of Akt were examined. The phosphorylation of Thr-308 located in the kinase catalytic domain of Akt is necessary for the activation, and the phosphorylation of Ser-473 located in the regulatory domain of Akt supports the activation. As shown in Fig. 2, A (right) and B, the treatment with BAPTA-AM increased the phosphorylation of Akt both at Ser-473 and Thr-308, and the phosphorylation level increased to a maximum at 2 h, and was sustained thereafter till 4 h. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Akt decreased in a time-dependent manner with thapsigargin (Fig. 2, A (left) and B). Next we examined whether Ca2+ modulators also have an effect on the kinase activity of Akt. Fig. 2C shows that Akt activity is suppressed after the treatment with thapsigargin, but increased with BAPTA-AM. These results were consistent with the change in the phosphorylation status of Akt on treatment with Ca2+ modulators such as thapsigargin and BAPTA-AM. Together, Akt signaling was suppressed by the long term elevation of [Ca2+]i with thapsigargin, but was enhanced by the long term lowering of [Ca2+]i with BAPTA-AM. This suggests a Ca2+-dependent regulation of Akt signaling in H9c2 cells. Furthermore, the Ca2+-induced suppression of Akt signaling was compatible with the enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis in H9c2 cells treated with H2O2 (Fig. 1, B and C). The Expression of PP2Acα Is Transcriptionally Regulated by Ca2+Modulators—3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1) is known to be responsible for phosphorylating Akt at Thr-308, and is activated by both phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,)-bisphosphate, products of PI3K (9Scheid M.P. Woodgett J.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 10Franke T.F. Hornik C.P. Segev L. Shostak G.A. Sugimoto C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8983-8998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the upstream kinases are involved in the regulation of Akt by the change of [Ca2+]i, the activities for PI3K and PDK1 were measured in the cells treated with Ca2+ modulators. However, neither activities showed any significant change even if the cells were treated with thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM for 0–4 h (data not shown). Therefore, we focused on Ser/Thr protein phosphatases that could dephosphorylate and inactivate Akt to regulate the Akt signaling pathway (7Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 458-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To investigate whether [Ca2+]i levels affect the expression of protein Ser/Thr phosphatases, the cells were treated with 5 μm thapsigargin or 10 μm BAPTA-AM for 0–4 h, and transcriptional levels were estimated by Northern blot analysis for protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunit α (PP2Acα) and protein phosphatase 1α catalytic subunit (PP1αc). In Fig. 3A, the level of PP2Acα mRNA was increased by thapsigargin but decreased by BAPTA-AM. In contrast, the mRNA level of PP1αc was not significantly changed by the Ca2+ modulators. In the immunoblot analysis, the protein level of PP2Acα was increased by thapsigargin but decreased by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 3B). However, the protein level of PP1αc was not influenced by thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM. The protein level of calcineurin/PP2B was not influenced by thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM either (data not shown). These results were consistent with results of the change of transcriptional levels for the phosphatases in the cells treated with each Ca2+ modulator. The enzymatic activity of PP2A was also assayed in the cells treated with thapsigargin or BAPTA-AM for 0–4 h. As shown in Fig. 3C, the activity of PP2A increased with thapsigargin by ∼2-fold compared with that of untreated cells. In contrast, the activity was slightly suppressed after 2 h treatment with BAPTA-AM. Collectively, these results indicate that PP2Acα expression is transcriptionally regulated by the long term change of [Ca2+]i to control the phosphorylation status of target molecules including Akt.

Here, we show that 5-LO expression and activity were induced by genotoxic agents in a p53-independent manner and antagonized p53- or genotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. 5-LO inhibited p53-governed transactivation of the pro-apoptotic genes bax and pig3 but not of p21(WAF1/CIP1) or mdm2. This may be explained by 5-LO capability to inhibit the binding of p53 to promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and p53 subnuclear relocalization into PML-nuclear bodies in response to genotoxic stress. Interestingly, 5-LO activity appears to be involved in nuclear retention and inactivation of wild-type p53 in malignant mesothelioma cells. In these cells, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of 5-LO enabled suppression of in vitro tumorigenicity by low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs. Together, these results uncover novel functions of 5-LO and contribute to the understanding of 5-LO involvement in tumor progression. Moreover, they provide a rationale to the therapeutic use of 5-LO inhibitors to enhance cancer chemosensitivity in selected tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1986784635,"Mast cells generate eicosanoids that are linked to asthma and other inflammatory diseases. A basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factor termed MITF is essential for the development of mast cells. Although other substances also linked to inflammatory reactions (such as various proteases and serotonin) require MITF for their expression, the role of MITF in eicosanoid generation has not been studied. We examined eicosanoid generation in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) of <i>tg/tg</i> mice that lack MITF. Most eicosanoids generated by BMMCs are either prostaglandin (PG) D<sub>2</sub> or leukotriene C<sub>4</sub>. The former is synthesized via the cyclooxygenase pathway, whereas the latter is synthesized via the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. In response to stimulation with IgE and antigens, BMMCs of <i>tg/tg</i> mice synthesized leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> normally. However, neither immediate nor delayed PGD<sub>2</sub> production was detected in these BMMCs. This indicates that MITF is a transcription factor that specifically activates the cyclooxygenase pathway, but not the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Significant decreases in expression of hematopoietic PGD<sub>2</sub> synthase (hPGDS, a terminal synthase for PGD<sub>2</sub>) were observed at both mRNA and protein levels in <i>tg/tg</i> BMMCs. MITF transactivated the hPGDS gene via a CACCTG motif located in the promoter region. MITF appeared to be essential for generation of PGD<sub>2</sub> by enhancing expression of the hPGDS gene in BMMCs."

The MAPK cascades transmit extracellular activating signals through sequential phosphorylation and activation of MKK kinase (MAP3K), MKK, and MAPK. At non-physiological concentrations in vitro, a purified MAP3K or MKK can directly bind and phosphorylate a particular MKK or MAPK, respectively, without a need for an additional regulatory molecule. However, it remains less clear in vivo how an activated upstream kinase finds and interacts with a specific inactive downstream kinase (among thousands of other cellular proteins). One can envision the involvement of either scaffold molecules or molecular motors that may bring MAP3K, MKK, and MAPK to close physical proximity in cells. Indeed, several scaffolding molecules have been found which specifically group some or all components in a particular MAPK cascade to ensure signaling specificity and efficiency (4Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). In addition, certain MAPK components have also been found to bind cellular motors (5Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Verhey K.J. Rapoport T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent minus-end moving motor. In complex and cooperation with the dynactin complex, which includes p150Glued, p50 dynamitin, actin-related protein-1, and several other polypeptides, dynein hydrolyzes ATP and drives movement of various cellular cargos especially those membranous vesicles (e.g. Golgi apparatus) (7Allan V.

To look for potential regulators of MKK6, an MKK acting specifically upstream of the p38 MAPKs (9Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen. Unexpectedly, p150Glued, a key component of the dynein-dynactin complex (7Allan V. Curr.

Furthermore, we show that p150Glued, dynein, and functional microtubules are indispensable for activation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPKs in vivo. Cell Culture and Reagents—HeLa and HEK 293T cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Nocodazole was purchased from Calbiochem; colchicine, paclitaxel (Taxol), and erythro-9-[3-(2-hydroxynonyl)]adenine (EHNA) were from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The yeast strain AH109 (Mat a) expressing the bait protein GAL4-DBD-human MKK6(KM) was mated with Y187 (Mat α) containing the MATCHMAKER human skeletal muscle cDNA library following manufacturer's instruction (BD Biosciences). Antibodies—Anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38, and anti-phospho-MKK3/6 were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-p150Glued was from BD Biosciences; anti-β-tublin, anti-dynein intermediate chain, and anti-FLAG were from Sigma; anti-MKK3/6 was from Up-state; anti-HA, anti-GFP, anti-His-tag, anti-Akt, and anti-ERK1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-GST was from Amersham Biosciences; and anti-giantin was from Dr. H. P. Hauri. Cell lysis, kinase assays, and Western blot were carried out as described by Xu et al. (10Xu Q. Yu L. Liu L. Cheung C.F. Li X. Yee S.P. Yang X.J. Wu Z. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1940-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Microtubule Preparation—Five grams of rat brain were homogenized in the PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). Homogenates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was then clarified further by centrifugation at 180,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was treated with 1 mm GTP and 20 μm Taxol at 37 °C for 15 min to polymerize microtubules. The polymerized microtubules were pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were washed once with the PEM buffer and resuspended in 250–400 μl of PEM buffer containing 1 mm GTP and 20 μm Taxol. siRNA Transfection—Human p150Glued siRNA (sense: 5′ uga ugg aac ugu uca agg c) was purchased from Dharmacon Inc. (Lafayette, CO). HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA at a final concentration of 100 nm per sample using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. p150Glued Specifically Interacts with MKK3/6—Using MKK6 as bait to screen a human skeletal muscle cDNA library, we found several clones displaying specific interaction with MKK6(KM), a kinase-dead form of MKK6, but not the control bait. Among them, there were two clones encoding different but overlapping regions of the carboxyl terminus of p150Glued (Fig. 1A). To further confirm the specific interaction between p150Glued and MKK6, we studied their interaction in mammalian cells. 293T cells were transfected with either HA-MKK6 or HA-JNK2 (control). The endogenous p150Glued was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-MKK6 but not HA-JNK2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 6). Conversely, HA-MKK6 but not HA-JNK2 was co-immuoprecipitated with the endogenous p150Glued dynactin (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 7). To delineate the MKK6-interacting regions on p150Glued, clone 14 (Fig. 1A) was first divided into two fragments (i.e. amino acids (aa) 893-1025 and aa 1026–1292), each fused in-frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In a GST-pull-down assay, only the extreme carboxyl terminus of p150Glued (i.e. aa 1026–1292) could bind MKK6. 2P.-Y. Cheung and Z. Wu, unpublished data. To fine map the MKK6-interacting domain, this 266-aa carboxyl terminus of p150Glued was further divided into three smaller fragments (Fig. 1C, left). Only CT3 (i.e. aa 1198–1292) could bind MKK6 in the GST-pull-down assays (Fig. 1C, right). To map the p150Glued-interacting domain on MKK6, the amino terminus (NT: aa 1–59) and the kinase domain (KD: aa 60–257) of MKK6 were independently fused with the yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (aa 1–147), and the fusion proteins were tested for their interaction with both clones 26 and 14 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Only the kinase domain of MKK6 displayed specific interaction with both clone 26 and 14 (Fig. 1D). As MKK3 is a close homologue of MKK6 with a nearly identical kinase domain, we tested whether MKK3 could interact with p150Glued. Yeast vectors encoding either MKK3 or two other related stress-activated MKKs, JNKK1 (or MKK4) and JNKK2 (or MKK7) (1Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar), were tested for their interaction with clones 26 and 14 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Indeed, only MKK3, but not JNKK1 and JNKK2, specifically interacted with p150Glued (Fig. 1E). MKK6 Directly Associates with Tubulin—As p150Glued is a microtubule-binding protein (8Allan V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 630-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we then tested whether MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK also associate with microtubules. Native microtubules were first polymerized and purified from rat brain (Fig. 2A), and the associated proteins were identified by Western blot. Like p150Glued and dynein intermediate chain, a fraction of the endogenous MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK were also found to associate with microtubules (Fig. 2B). As a control, Akt was not present in our microtubule preparation (Fig. 2B). Using microtubules polymerized in vitro with the purified tubulins, we found that only the recombinant MKK6, but not the p38 MAPK or ATF2, co-sedimented with microtubules (Fig. 2C). This suggested that MKK6, but not the p38 MAPK, directly binds to microtubules. To find out whether MKK6 also interacts with soluble tubulins, we carried out both in vivo and in vitro binding assays. In vivo, under conditions that tubulins did not polymerize, the endogenous MKK3/6 were specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the soluble tubulins as was p150Glued dynactin (Fig. 2D). In vitro, when mixed with the purified tubulins, only the recombinant MKK6, but not the p38 MAPK or ATF2, interacted with tubulins in the GST-pull-down assays (Fig. 2E). p150Glued and Dynein Motor Are Involved in Signal-induced Phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPKs—To understand the cellular function of the interaction between MKK6 and p150Glued, we first knocked down the expression of the endogenous p150Glued with siRNA before cells were stimulated by sorbitol. We found that the sorbitol-induced phosphorylation of both MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK were specifically reduced by the p150Glued-specific siRNA but not by a control siRNA (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). Similarly, the p150Glued siRNA could also specifically reduce the tumor necrosis factor α-induced phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPK. 2P.-Y. Cheung and Z. Wu, unpublished data. The decrease in the level of both phospho-MKK3/6 and phospho-p38 MAPK correlated with that of p150Glued expression (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 6). Interestingly, the p150Glued-siRNA had no obvious effect on the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of ERKs, the prototypic members of the MAPK family. 2P.-Y. Cheung and Z. Wu, unpublished data. As p150Glued is a key component of the dynein-dynactin complex, the reduction in p150Glued level would be expected to adversely affect the dynein motor function. To find out whether the dynein motor was involved, we first resorted to EHNA, a known inhibitor of the dynein ATPase activity (11Penningroth S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 12Dhani S.U. Mohammad-Panah R. Ahmed N. Ackerley C. Ramjeesingh M. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16262-16270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As a control, we first confirmed that EHNA caused dispersal of giantin in the Golgi apparatus, 2P.-Y. Cheung and Z. Wu, unpublished data. the aggregation of which being a known dynein-dependent process (13Presley J.F. Cole N.B. Schroer T.A. Hirschberg K. Zaal K.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Nature. 1997; 389: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 14Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Importantly, in cells pretreated with EHNA, the sorbitol-induced phosphorylation of both MKK3/6 and p38 MAPKs was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs was not affected by similar EHNA treatment (Fig. 3C). To further implicate a role for dynein in MKK3/6-p38 MAPK activation, we overexpressed p50 dynamitin, which is known to disrupt the dynein-dynactin complex and interferes with the dynein function (7Allan V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Allan V. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 630-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sorbitol-induced phosphorylation of the endogenous p38 MAPK was reduced in cells overexpressing p50 dynamitin but not the empty vector (Fig. 3D). Functional Microtubules Are Required for Signal-induced Phosphorylation of MKK3/6 and p38 MAPKs—As dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor and a fraction of MKK6, the p38 MAPK, and 150Glued were all found to associate with microtubules (Fig. 2), we next examined the involvement of microtubules. Before stimulating cells with sorbitol, we first pretreated cells separately with nocodazole, colchicine, and Taxol, all being microtubule-interfering drugs that specifically disrupt the normal function of microtubules via different mechanisms (15Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 252-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sorbitol-induced phosphorylation of both MKK3/6 and the p38 MAPK was significantly reduced in cells pretreated with the drugs (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the tumor necrosis factor α-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK could also be inhibited by these microtubule-interfering drugs.2 Consistent with our previous data (Fig. 3C), the EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity were not affected by any of the three microtubule-interfering drugs (Fig. 4B). Associations between MAPK components and microtubules have long been observed. Both ERKs and JNKs were found to associate with microtubules in different cell types (16Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of such interactions remains poorly understood. Interestingly, links between MAPK components and microtubule-associated motors started to emerge in recent years. Mixed-lineage kinase 2, a member of the MAP3K superfamily, was found to interact with several members of the KIF3 kinesin motor complex (5Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In addition, JNK-interacting proteins, the scaffold proteins involved in organizing the JNK signaling complex (4Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), were found to be cargos for kinesin by interacting with the kinesin light chain (6Verhey K.J. Rapoport T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma cells, JNK-interacting proteins, together with other components of the JNK pathway, were transported to the neurite tips in a kinesin-dependent manner. In both cases above, however, it has not been addressed whether disruption of these interactions affects subsequent MAPK activation. Similar to the role of kinesin light chain for kinesin motors, several components of the dynein-dynactin complex have been implicated in cargo binding. For example, actin-related protein-1 of the dynactin complex interacts with the Golgi-associated βIII spectrin (17Horenstein M.G. Nador R.G. Chadburn A. Hyjek E.M. Inghirami G. Knowles D.M. Cesarman E. Blood. 1997; 90: 1186-1191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dynein light chain Tctex-1 interacts with the cytoplasmic portion of rhodopsin and the rhodopsin-containing vesicles can be moved in vitro on microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner (18Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). As to p150Glued, while its amino terminus binds microtubules, its carboxyl terminus is thought to participate in cargo-binding (7Allan V. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Huntingtin-associated protein 1 was the first protein known to directly interact with the cargo-binding end of p150Glued and was recently confirmed to be a bona fide cargo of dynein (19Engelender S. Sharp A.H. Colomer V. Tokito M.K. Lanahan A. Worley P. Holzbaur E.L. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 20Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M.

Humbert S. Saudou F. Cell. 2004; 118: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding site for Huntingtin-associated protein 1 on p150Glued overlaps with that for MKK3/6. As p150Glued, dynein, and functional microtubules are all required for activation of MKK3/6 and the p38 MAPKs, we suggest that MKK3/6 may also serve as cargos for the dynein motor. In contrast to the p38 MAPKs, we find that the activation of ERKs by EGF is not dependent on p150Glued, dynein, or functional microtubules. As ERKs can be activated by diverse stimuli in addition to EGF, it remains to be determined whether activation of ERKs under those conditions requires molecular motors and microtubules. To our knowledge, the current study represents the first report of a functional link between MAPK components and dynein motors. Our data also suggest that the cellular motors can not only carry signaling complexes to different subcellular compartments but also play a more direct role in the process of signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W2079380500,"PMR1 is an endonuclease that is activated by estrogen to degrade Xenopus albumin mRNA. A previous report showed that the functional unit of endonuclease-mediated mRNA decay is a ∼680-kDa polysome-bound complex that contains both PMR1 and substrate mRNA. PMR1 contains two domains involved in endonuclease targeting to polysomes, an N-terminal domain that lies between residues 200 and 250, and a C-terminal domain that lies within the last 100 residues. Loss of either domain inactivated PMR1 targeting to polysomes and stabilized albumin mRNA. The current study identified a phosphorylated tyrosine residue within the C-terminal polysome-targeting domain and showed that this modification is required for PMR1-mediated mRNA decay. Changing this tyrosine to phenylalanine inactivated the targeting of PMR1 to polysomes, blocked binding of PMR1 to the functional complex containing its substrate mRNA, prevented the targeting of a green fluorescent protein fusion protein to this complex, and stabilized albumin mRNA to degradation by PMR1 in vivo. A general tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibited the phosphorylation of PMR1, which in turn inhibited PMR1-catalyzed degradation of albumin mRNA.

This disrupts the structure of the translating mRNP, 1The abbreviations used are: mRNP, messenger ribonucleoprotein particle; PMR1, polysomal ribonuclease 1; PMR60, catalytically active 60-kDa processed form of PMR1; PMR60°, catalytically inactive form of PMR60; TAP, tandem affinity tag; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription. and mRNA targeted for degradation becomes associated with a different set of proteins than those of the actively translating complex (2Tharun S. Parker R. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1075-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In both yeast and mammalian cells, proteins involved in decapping and 5′-3′ mRNA degradation are concentrated in discrete cytoplasmic foci, termed P-bodies (3Sheth U. Parker R. Science. 2003; 300: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar), or GW bodies (4Eystathioy T. Jakyymiw A Chan E.K.L. Seraphin B. Cougot N. Fritzler M.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1171-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) for the presence of a protein rich in glycine and tryptophan residues. Deadenylated yeast mRNAs relocate from actively translating polysomes to these foci before degradation of the mRNA body. The same biochemical process has yet to be shown for mammalian cells, but the similarities between the constituents of these complexes suggest this will also be the case. Exosome-catalyzed 3′-5′ decay is the other principal pathway seen in yeast (5van Hoof A. Staples R.R. Baker R.E. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8230-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although earlier work suggested that this process was secondary to 5′-3′ decay, the finding that a subset of mRNAs are up-regulated in cells deleted for Xrn1 or Dcp1 raises the possibility that exosome-catalyzed 3′-5′ decay may play a greater role in yeast mRNA decay than previously appreciated (6He F. Li X. Spatrick P. Casillo R. Dong S. Jacobson A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1439-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that most vertebrate mRNAs are degraded by the exosome in a 3′-5′ manner; however, data supporting this come primarily from in vitro experiments (7Chen C.Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Pruijn G.J. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar) and a convincing in vivo demonstration yet to be presented. In addition to exonuclease-mediated mRNA decay pathways there are numerous examples of endonuclease-mediated mRNA decay in vertebrate cells. Examples include avian apovery low density lipoprotein II mRNA (8Binder R. Hwang S.P. Ratnasabapathy R. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16910-16918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), vitellogenin (9Cunningham K.S. Dodson R.E. Nagel M.A. Shapiro D.J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6108-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). On a functional level endonuclease cleavage within the mRNA body has the same effect as deadenylation in that it disrupts the physical relationship between the cap and the poly(A) tail. The best characterized mRNA endonuclease is polysomal ribonuclease 1, or PMR1. PMR1 was identified in Xenopus liver as a polysome-associated endonuclease whose activation after estrogen stimulation resulted in the selective degradation of serum protein mRNAs (15Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Schoenberg D.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10490-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Pastori R.L. Moskaitis J.E. Buzek S.W. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, this protein is a member of the peroxidase gene family (17Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previous work showed that liver PMR1 is associated with polysomes and was released by EDTA as part of a ∼680-kDa complex that could be recovered on oligo(dT) cellulose (18Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Schoenberg D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1156-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this tissue albumin mRNA decay results from estrogen stimulating a 20-fold increase in unit activity of the polysome-bound enzyme. These data indicated that two critical events are involved in estrogen regulation of endonuclease-mediated mRNA decay. The first is the targeting of the endonuclease to polysomes, and the second is the activation of the polysome-bound enzyme. To characterize the targeting of PMR1 to polysomes we developed a form of the full-length protein that does not degrade substrate mRNA but shows the same sedimentation pattern in transfected Cos-1 cells as seen for PMR1 in Xenopus liver (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Treating transfected cells with puromycin or adding EDTA to cell extracts released PMR1 in a ∼680-kDa complex, and deletion mapping experiments identified 2 domains that mediate its targeting both to polysomes and to the ∼680-kDa complex. The ∼680-kDa complex also contains albumin mRNA, and deletions that disrupted the targeting of PMR1 to polysomes or to this complex interfered with the recovery of albumin mRNA by PMR1 bearing a C-terminal tandem affinity (TAP) tag. Intriguingly, PMR1-TAP selectively recovered its substrate albumin mRNA on IgG-Sepharose but did not recover luciferase mRNA. Experiments with the catalytically active form of the enzyme showed that PMR1 selectively degraded albumin but not luciferase mRNA. Albumin mRNA was stabilized if its translation was blocked by inserting a stable stem-loop into the 5′-untranslated region, indicating that it must be actively translated to be targeted for degradation by PMR1. PMR1 has 2 domains that function in its targeting to polysomes (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One domain lies between the first 200 and 250 amino acids, and a second domain lies somewhere between 50 and 100 amino acids upstream from the C terminus. Identifying the precise location of the C-terminal targeting domain proved problematic. Loss of the C-terminal 50 amino acids (Δ50C) produced a protein that could no longer bind to polysomes or form an mRNP complex with albumin mRNA. However, this sequence was not sufficient to target a GFP fusion protein to either polysomes or the mRNP complex. This required an additional upstream 50 amino acids, a result suggesting that the 50-amino acid deletion disrupted the C-terminal targeting domain. A scan of sequence motifs identified a possible tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 650, 19 amino acids upstream of the Δ50C deletion site. Data presented here show that PMR1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated both in Xenopus liver and in transfected Cos-1 cells. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of PMR1 is required for its targeting to polysomes, for formation of the ∼680-kDa polysome-bound complex with substrate mRNA, and for endonuclease-mediated mRNA decay. Plasmid Constructs—The preparation of plasmids expressing catalytically active PMR1, catalytically inactive PMR1, and C-terminal deletions with or without a TAP tag on the C terminus were described previously (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The nomenclature used both there and in the present paper reflects the size of the mature PMR1 peptide, with PMR60 corresponding to the full-length, catalytically active form of the protein, and PMR60° corresponding to a catalytically inactive form of the protein having histidine residues at 393 and 479 changed to alanine. Deletions that remove 50, 100, or 150 amino acids from the C terminus are indicated as Δ50C, Δ100C, and Δ150C, respectively. All of the constructs have an Myc epitope tag on the N terminus and were detected using a monoclonal antibody to this tag. The mutations Y649F, Y650F, and the double mutant Y649,650F were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the tyrosines at positions 649 or 650 using the GeneEditor mutagenesis kit (Promega). The preparation of Y649F PMR1 used the primer 5′-GACCGGTTTTTCTATGAGCAG, the preparation of Y650F PMR1 used the primer 5′-CGGTTTTACTTTGAGCAGCCT, and the preparation of Y649,650F PMR1 used the primer 5′-GGAGACCGGTTTTTCTTTGAGCAGCCTTCAG. The Y650D mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the forward primer 5′-GACCGGTTTTACGATGAGCAGCC and the reverse primer 5′-GGCTGCTCATCGTAAAACCGGTC. To prepare a tetracycline-regulated plasmid expressing PMR60, the sequence encoding the full-length protein was PCR-amplified from the pcDNA3-containing plasmid using the primers 5′-TGACAAGCTTCCGCCATTACAGGACAGTGC and 5′-GATCGCGGCCGCTTAAGCCACTTTCCAAGGAT, which contain restriction sites for NotI and HindIII, respectively. The amplified product was then digested with HindIII and NotI and ligated into the corresponding sites in pTRE-myc (Clontech). The sequences of all plasmids were confirmed before use in transfection experiments. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Cos-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. For most experiments 2.5 × 106 cells in log phase growth were transfected with 10 μg (total) of plasmid DNA by using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Unless otherwise indicated cells were collected 40 h after transfection. In experiments using puromycin to disrupt ribosomes, 200 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium for 30 min before harvest. Cos-1 (tTA) cells were prepared by stable transfection of Cos-1 cells with pCMVtetRVP16-hygro (kindly provided by Jose Garcia-Sanz) and selection in hygromycin-containing medium. For the experiment in Fig. 8A, 1.6 × 106 cells were first plated in a 100-mm dish in medium containing 1 μg/ml doxycycline. Twenty-four hours later they were transfected in doxycycline-containing medium with 10 μg of pTRE-myc-PMR60-TAP and kept for an additional 15 h in doxycycline-containing medium. Expression of myc-PMR60-TAP was induced by removing doxycycline from the medium and washing the cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline. AG9 or AG18 (100 μm) were added at the time of induction, and cells were harvested 3 and 6 h later for analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated PMR60 recovered on IgG-Sepharose. The experiment in Fig. 7B used the same approach except that cells were transfected with 8 μg of pTRE-myc-PMR60 or empty vector plus 1 μg each of the albumin and luciferase expression plasmids. Doxycycline was removed from the medium 15 h later, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated for 6 h in fresh medium containing either no added drug or 100 μm AG9 or AG18. Total RNA recovered from each culture was analyzed as described below by ribonuclease protection assay for albumin and luciferase mRNA.Fig. 7The Y650F mutation stabilizes albumin mRNA to degradation by PMR1. A, Cos-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA expressing catalytically active PMR60, or pcDNA3 expressing PMR60 with the Y650F mutation together with plasmids expressing albumin and luciferase mRNA. The relative expression each protein was determined by Western blot (left panel), and their impact on steady-state levels of albumin and luciferase mRNA was determined by RNase protection (right panel). The relative amount of albumin mRNA normalized to luciferase mRNA determined by phosphorimaging analysis is shown beneath the autoradiogram. B, the catalytic activity of PMR60 and PMR60 with the Y650F mutation was determined by assaying the degradation of 5′ 32P-labeled albumin mRNA by PMR60-TAP, PMR60-TAP with the Y650F mutation, or GFP-TAP that were expressed in transfected cells and recovered on IgG-Sepharose. The upper panel is a Western blot of input protein and protein recovered from IgG-Sepharose Tev protease cleavage, and the lower panel is a time course of 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min of incubation with substrate RNA.

Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then suspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 10 μl/ml phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma), and 10 μl/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen)). After incubation for 15 min on ice, the cells were homogenized with 30 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (A pestle), and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. To disassociate polysomes, post-mitochondrial supernatant was adjusted to 50 mm EDTA. Linear gradients of 10–40% (w/v) sucrose were prepared in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol containing either 5 mm MgCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. Post-mitochondrial extracts were gently layered on top of the gradient followed by centrifugation for 3.5 h at 228,000 × g in a Sorvall TH641 rotor. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. Linear gradients of 10–40% (v/v) glycerol were prepared in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Post-mitochondrial extracts were separated by centrifugation for 20 h at 83,000 × g in a Sorvall TH641 rotor. Molecular size markers containing a mixture of thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000), ferritin (Mr 440,000), catalase (Mr 232,000), lactate dehydrogenase (Mr 140,000), and bovine serum albumin (Mr 67,000) were fractionated on a parallel gradient. Fractions containing GFP and fusion proteins were transferred to 96-well plate and measured with a Tecan GENios fluorescence plate reader at 470 nm. Antibodies—Antibodies to the c-Myc epitope tag (9E10), GFP (B2), and ribosomal protein S6 (E13) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibodies to PMR1 were described previously (14Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol.

The phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, and PY20 and RC20:biotin were purchased from BD Biosciences. Western blots were quantified by scanning densitometry of x-ray films using a calibrated scanner and ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of Xenopus Liver PMR1—Male Xenopus were injected 9 h before death with 1 mg of 17β-estradiol. Polysomes isolated from the excised livers were extracted with 0.4 m KCl to obtain a crude preparation of PMR1-containing protein (20Schoenberg D.R. Cunningham K.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 60-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One mg of dialyzed extract was incubated with protein A-Sepharose to which was bound a polyclonal antibody to Xenopus PMR1 (14Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6108-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) or 4G10. After washing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, bound protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein recovered with PMR1 antibody was analyzed by Western blot using the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies PY20 or RC20 or the epitope-specific PMR1 antibody 1277 (17Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Protein recovered using 4G10 was analyzed by Western blot using antibody 1277. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled rabbit anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody for PY20, horseradish peroxidase-coupled mouse anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody for PMR1 antibody 1277, and horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin was used to identify the biotin tag on RC20. Immunoprecipitation of Tyrosine-phosphorylated PMR1—20 μg of cytoplasmic extract prepared from cells transfected with PMR60°-TAP was incubated with gentle rocking for 2 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of RC20: biotin (BD Biosciences) or 5 μl of non-immune IgG. This was added to 20 μl of drained SoftLink avidin resin (Promega) that was blocked by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 200 μl of Cos-1 cytoplasmic extract and washed 3 times with washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). Each mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed with washing buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Input, unbound, and bound fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with PY20 or antibody to the Myc epitope. The resulting film was quantified by scanning densitometry and analyzed using ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). IgG-Sepharose Selection of PMR1-TAP Complexes—Cells were transiently transfected with 6 μg of vector (pcDNA3), plasmid myc-PMR60°-TAP, or myc-PMR60°-TAP with the Y650F mutation plus 2 μg each of plasmids expressing full-length albumin (21Das Gupta J. Gu H. Chernokalskaya E. Gao X. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 766-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and luciferase mRNA. 250 μl of post-mitochondrial extract in lysis buffer containing 10 mm EDTA was mixed with 50 μl of drained IgG-Sepharose™ 6 beads (Amersham Biosciences) that was pre-blocked with lysate from non-transfected cells. This was incubated by end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with 0.5 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and once with Tev buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1%Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C. Bound complexes were eluted by cleavage with 50 units of Tev protease (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of Tev buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein and RNA released from the resin were extracted using Trizol reagent, PMR1 was analyzed by Western blot using the monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope tag or PY20, and RNA samples were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. For the assay of endonuclease activity, protein recovered from IgG-Sepharose by Tev cleavage was incubated with 250 fmol of a 5′ 32P-labeled 160-nucleotide transcript derived from the portion of albumin mRNA bearing the mapped PMR1 cleavage sites. The reaction mixtures were separated on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel and analyzed by phosphorimaging. RT-PCR Analysis of Albumin and Luciferase mRNA—Albumin and luciferase mRNA recovered by IgG-Sepharose beads were analyzed by RT-PCR as described previously (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was performed with oligo(dT)15 as primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Albumin mRNA was amplified using 5′-CAAAGACCAGCCTTCAAACTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CACAGTTGAATGCTCTAAGCA-3′ (antisense). Luciferase mRNA was amplified using 5′-AGATCCACAACCTTCGCTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGAGGAGCCTTCAGGATTAC-3′ (antisense). In each set the sense primer was 5′ 32P-labeled. PCR amplification was performed for 18 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 61 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, conditions that were empirically determined to lie in the linear range. Serial dilutions of albumin and luciferase mRNA were analyzed in parallel, the products from each reaction were separated on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel, and the results were quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. Ribonuclease Protection Assay—2 × 106 cells were transfected as above with plasmids expressing albumin and luciferase mRNA and co-transfected with plasmids expressing catalytically active myc-PMR60 (12Bremer K.A. Stevens A. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 1157-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or protein bearing the Y650F mutation. Total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent. The antisense albumin riboprobe was synthesized by in vitro transcription (Ambion) using T7 promoter from a pcRII-Topo plasmid containing exons 14 and 15 of albumin cDNA. The antisense firefly luciferase riboprobe was synthesized with T3 promoter from a pBluescript(SK) plasmid containing the first 153 nucleotides of firefly luciferase cDNA. Ribonuclease protection assay was carried out with 5 μg of total RNA hybridized to 40 pg of each riboprobe using the ribonuclease protection assay III kit (Ambion), and protected probe was separated on a denaturing 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. PMR1 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated in Xenopus Liver and Transfected Cos-1 Cells—Signature motifs within the sequence of PMR1 are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. PMR1 is translated as an 80-kDa precursor that is processed to the catalytically active ∼60-kDa form (17Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The large open box shows the region of similarity to the peroxidases, with the polysome-targeting domains bracketed beneath. Notable in this analysis were three proline-rich domains identified as potential SH3 ligands and a single predicted site for tyrosine phosphorylation (black rectangle). The C-terminal targeting domain lies within the last 100 amino acids of PMR1, and previous results indicated this domain was interrupted by a deletion that removed the terminal 50 amino acids (Δ50C (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The location of the putative tyrosine phosphorylation site at position 650 was, therefore, consistent with a possible role in the C-terminal targeting domain of PMR1. Before embarking on a study of PMR1 phosphorylation in transfected Cos-1 cells we first asked whether the endogenous protein in Xenopus liver is tyrosine-phosphorylated. In the experiment in Fig. 1BXenopus liver polysomes were extracted with 0.4 m KCl to solubilize polysome-bound proteins (14Dompenciel R.E. Garnepudi V.R. Schoenberg D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6108-6118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the three left panels the dialyzed extract recovered by immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal antibody to PMR1 was analyzed by Western blot with two phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (PY20, RC20:biotin) or an epitope-specific antibody to PMR1 (1277 (17Chernokalskaya E. DuBell A.N. Cunningham K.S. Hanson M.N. Dompenciel R.E. Schoenberg D.R. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1537-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Each of these identified the 62-kDa PMR1 peptide. The same polysome extract was immunoprecipitated using the phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, and the Western blot of recovered proteins was probed with the PMR1 epitope-specific antibody 1277 (right panel). This too identified a single 62-kDa protein, indicating that PMR1 in Xenopus liver is tyrosine-phosphorylated. The sample evaluated here came from frogs that received estrogen 9 h before death, a time that just precedes the major drop in albumin mRNA (22Schoenberg D.R. Moskaitis J.E. Smith Jr., J.H. Pastori R.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 805-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similar results were seen with frogs that did not receive estrogen, suggesting that the hormone does not induce major changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of PMR1. Previous work used sequential deletions of a catalytically inactive form of PMR1 (PMR60°) bearing a an N-terminal Myc epitope tag to map the general locations of N- and C-terminal domains involved in endonuclease targeting to polysomes (19Yang F. Schoenberg D.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 435-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The use of proteins bearing a C-terminal tandem affinity (TAP) tag facilitated the recovery of PMR1-containing complexes on IgG-Sepharose. To test whether PMR1 expressed in Cos-1 cells is tyrosine-phosphorylated within the C-terminal 100 amino acids, Cos-1 cells were transfected with TAP fusions of the full-length protein (PMR60°) or deletions that removed 50 (Δ50C) or 100 (Δ100C) amino acids from the C terminus. Polysome-bound complexes were dissociated by treating cells with puromycin for 30 min before harvest, and the PMR1-TAP fusion proteins were recovered on IgG-Sepharose. Western blot with antibody to the Myc tag showed that all three forms of PMR1 were recovered with equal efficiency (Fig. 1C, left panel). In contrast, only full-length PMR60° and the Δ50C deletion showed appreciable tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, right panel). Therefore, PMR1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in Xenopus liver and in transfected Cos-1 cells, and as predicted, the tyrosine phosphorylation site lies within the last 100 amino acids. The sequence RDGDRFYY located between amino acids 643 and 650 matches a consensus tyrosine phosphorylation sequence (R/K)XX(D/G)XXXY. The presence of adjacent tyrosines within this site raised the possibility that PMR1 might be phosphorylated on either or both of these residues. To pinpoint the residue that was phosphorylated, each tyrosine was changed to phenylalanine (Y649F, Y650F) or both were change"

In this report, we further investigated whether the CC of other GRKs had the same functions and defined the specific sequences in CC that are required for the functions. The CC regions of GRK-1, GRK-2, and GRK-5, representatives of the three subfamilies of GRKs, could bind rhodopsin in vitro and inhibit GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin, but not a peptide GRK substrate. Through a series of mutagenesis analyses, a proline-rich motif in the CC was identified as the key element involved in the interaction between the CC region and rhodopsin. Point mutations of this motif not only disrupted the interaction of GRK-2 with rhodopsin but also abolished the ability of GRK-2 to phosphorylate rhodopsin. The findings that the CC region of GRKs interact only with the light-activated but not the non-activated rhodopsin and that the N-terminal domain of GRK-2 interacts with rhodopsin in a light-independent manner suggest that the CC region is responsible for the recognition of activated GPCRs in the canonical model. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are a family of serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate many activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and play an important role in GPCR desensitization.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation is one of the very well characterized mechanisms for GPCR desensitization. Receptor phosphorylation rapidly initiates the binding of arrestins, which blocks the activation of G proteins, leading to rapid homologous desensitization (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions are thought to be important for regulating the localization and enzymatic activity of GRKs. In the canonical model, GRKs rapidly recognize and phosphorylate activated GPCRs, leading to their homologous desensitization. In this process, GRKs exhibit two major characteristics: 1) they preferentially phosphorylate the activated (agonist-bound) rather than the non-activated GPCRs; 2) interaction of GRKs with their activated receptor substrates potently activates the kinase activity of GRKs. GPCRs are a family of thousands of seven-transmembrane proteins that share very low homology in their amino acid sequences. Palczewski et al. showed previously that a truncated rhodopsin with endopeptidase cleavage of all phosphorylation sites on the C terminus could still bind GRK-1 and stimulate phosphorylation of a synthesized peptide, suggesting that interaction beyond the phosphorylation site of rhodopsin with GRK-1 is important for GRK activity (25Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been also reported that the cytoplasmic loop III and a few sites in the other cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin are involved in interaction with GRK-1 (26Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, the domain or region of GRKs responsible for receptor recognition remains unclear. Based on the primary sequence analysis, GRKs contain a centrally located catalytic domain flanked by a large N- and a C-terminal regulatory domain, and the C-terminal domain of GRKs can be divided into two subdomains: a conserved region and a variable region (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 27Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of GRK-2 in complex with G protein β1γ2 subunits has been solved, which provides a structural basis to understand the biological functions of GRK-2 and the specific recognition and interaction of GRK-2 with its receptor substrates (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). According to this structure, the enzyme consists of three structural domains: a predominantly N-terminal regulator of G protein signaling homology domain, a central kinase catalytic domain, and a pleckstrin homology domain at the C terminus. The C-terminal conserved region (abbreviated as CC; residues 457–546) comprises the C-terminal part (residues 457–513) of the kinase domain and the second half of the regulator of G protein signaling homology domain (residues 514–546) (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). We have reported previously that the CC region of GRK-2 can inhibit GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin in vitro through direct binding of this region to rhodopsin and that a mutant of GRK-2 with CC deletion resulted in a complete loss of its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin, demonstrating that interaction of the CC region with rhodopsin is required for GRK-2 to phosphorylate the receptor (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The present work reveals a common role of this conserved region of GRKs in substrate recognition and defines a proline-rich motif within this region required for this interaction. Materials—Bovine GRK-2 was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Urea-treated rod outer segments were prepared from bovine retina as described previously (30Papermaster D.S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). All the operation was carried out under weak red light. The prepared rod outer segment was suspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. It showed negligible endogenous kinase activity and consisted of >80% rhodopsin. A truncated form of rhodopsin with a 19 amino acid residue deletion from the C terminus (329G-Rho) was made using endopeptidase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) cleavage as described previously (25Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Various Mutant Forms of GRKs—cDNAs corresponding to fragments of the C-terminal conserved region and the N-terminal domain of GRKs were amplified by PCR using 5′- and 3′-primers designed from each corresponding cDNA fragments. Point mutations were generated by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The vectors pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) and pTXB1 (Biolab Inc.) were used to construct the GST-fusion and intein-fusion fragments, respectively. Expression in E. coli and Purification of Various Mutant Forms of GRKs—The GST-fused CC fragment constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 22 °C for 16 h. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity absorption on GSH-Sepharose 4B and eluted with 5 mm GSH as described previously (31Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene. 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The intein-fused N-terminal domain (Met1–Asn189) of GRK-2 was expressed in E. coli ER2566 by induction with 10 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at 22 °C for 24 h in Tryptone-phosphate medium and was purified by chitin beads (Biolab Inc.) and used for the binding experiment. The mutant GRK-2 containing P467A, P468A, P469A, and P471A quadruple mutations (4PA mutant) was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and extracted as described previously (32Yang Q.H. Wu C.L. Lin K. Li L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 4PA mutant protein was partially purified by the procedure of chromatography on Q-Sepharose FF (Pharmacia) and Blue-Sepharose 4B as described for the wild-type enzyme (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and finally purified to homogeneity by chromatography on an fast performance liquid chromatography Hiload 16/60 Superdex 200 prep grade. The peak fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing pure mutant GRK-2 protein were pooled and stored at –20 °C in 50% glycerol. Assay of GRK-2-mediated Rhodopsin Phosphorylation—Phosphorylation reaction solution contained urea-treated rod outer segments (3 μm), and the purified wild-type GRK-2 (0–200 ng) in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.5 cpm/fmol) in a total volume of 20 μl. Reactions were bleached with light at 30 °C for 5 min, stopped with 20 μl of 2× SDS-sample buffer, and then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The 32P-labeled receptor bands were quantified using filmless autoradiographic analysis and excised and counted to determine the quantity of phosphate incorporation (picomoles). Assay of Phosphorylation of a Synthetic Peptide by GRK-2—A peptide GRK substrate (RRREEEEESAAA) was synthesized by CyberSyn (Aston, PA). A stock solution of the peptide was prepared and adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. Various concentrations of the peptide (0–1 mm) were incubated with wild-type GRK-2 or the 4PA mutant (100–400 ng), 329G-Rho* (0–3 μm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1 cpm/fmol; Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 20 μl at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 60% trichloroacetic acid. The quenched reactions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were transferred to a 2 × 2-cm2 P81 paper (Whatman) followed by five washes in 75 mm ice-cold phosphoric acid as described previously (33Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr, R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The GRK-2 activity was defined as the difference of phosphate incorporation in the presence and absence of the peptide. Detection of Rhodopsin Binding to GST- and Intein-fused GRK Fragments—Rhodopsin was pretreated with 1% Triton X-100. The 50 μl of 50% slurry of beads, which contained GST-fused GRK CC fragments or the intein-fused N-terminal domain of GRK-2 (1 μg each), respectively, was mixed with rhodopsin (1 μg) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Triton X-100, in a total volume of 200 μl. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for another 1 h. After washing three times with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100 (all the above operations were carried out under the condition of illumination noted above or in dark), the beads were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-rhodopsin antibody (Leinco Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO) and SDS-PAGE, respectively, to detect the retention of rhodopsin on the beads and the amount of the GRK proteins. The C-terminal Conserved Region of GRKs Specifically Interacts with Rhodopsin—It has long been known that the C-terminal domain of GRKs is involved in membrane localization. Our previous work found that the conserved region within the C-terminal domain of GRK-2 interacts with rhodopsin, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of GRKs has an additional role (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The seven known GRK molecules can be divided into three subfamilies based on their sequence homology and functional similarity: 1) the GRK-1/7 subfamily; 2) the GRK-2 (also known as β-adrenergic receptor kinase or βARK) subfamily including GRK-2 and GRK-3; and 3) the GRK-4 subfamily, consisting of GRK-4, GRK-5, and GRK-6 (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). We wanted to know whether the interaction between the CC and rhodopsin is unique to GRK-2 and tested whether the CCs of GRK-1 and GRK-5, representatives of the other two subfamilies, also interacted with rhodopsin. Fig. 1 shows the alignment and comparison of the amino acid sequence of CC from GRK-1, GRK-2, and GRK-5. Three GST fusion proteins, corresponding to the CC of GRK-1 (residues 456∼544), GRK-2 (residues 457∼546), and GRK-5 (residues 452∼541), respectively, were expressed and purified by GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Effects of these three CC fragments on GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation were determined. As shown in Fig. 2A, the three fusion proteins significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK-2 in a dose-dependent manner. These proteins started to show inhibition at 2 μm and inhibited GRK-2 activity by 65% at 6 μm. The results demonstrated that the CC of both GRK-1 and GRK-5, like CC of GRK-2, could inhibit the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK-2. However, none of the three CC fragments affect the phosphorylation of a synthesized peptide substrate by GRK-2 (data not shown).Fig. 2Interaction of GRKs-CC with rhodopsin.A, effects of CC of GRKs on GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin. GST-fused GRK1-CC, GRK2-CC, and GRK5-CC were purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” 2 and 6 μm concentrations of three proteins were mixed, respectively, with 3 μm rhodopsin in a total volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.5 cpm/fmol), 7.5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm EDTA. The reaction was started by addition of 100 ng of purified GRK-2 and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The results were quantified using filmless autoradiographic analysis. The data showed the percentage using GST as a control. Data shown were the mean ± range from two separate experiments done in duplicate. B, direct binding of GRK1-CC, GRK2-CC, and GRK5-CC with rhodopsin. 1–2 μg of GST-fused GRK1-CC, GRK2-CC, and GRK5-CC were bound to 20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads, and then 1 μg of light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) was added. After mixing for 1 h and washing three times, retention of rhodopsin were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-rhodopsin antibody (top), and the amount of GST fusion protein were detected by SDS-PAGE (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the inhibitory effect of the CC fragments on GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin is caused by the competition between these fragments and GRK-2 for the binding to rhodopsin, an in vitro binding assay was carried out. Each of the fusion proteins or GST (as a control) was bound to GSH-Sepharose beads and then incubated with rhodopsin under illumination for an hour at 4 °C. After extensively washing, the beads were treated with the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and rhodopsin retained by the beads was detected by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the CC fragments of GRK-1, GRK-2, and GRK-5 could interact with rhodopsin. Thus, we conclude that the CC of GRKs may harbor a conserved sequence that is required for binding rhodopsin. A Conserved Proline-rich Motif Is a Key Site Involved in the Interaction between CC and Rhodopsin—To further delineate the sequences that are pivotal for the interaction of CC with rhodopsin, a series of truncated CC fragments of GRK-2 were constructed and purified as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 3A). The ability of these fragments to bind rhodopsin was examined by incubation of activated rhodopsin with these GST fusion proteins bound to GSH-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing of the beads, retention of rhodopsin was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 3B, CC-Asn-466 and CC-Cys-531, but not CC-Asn-479 and CC-Cys-516, interacted with rhodopsin as GRK2-CC did. Based on these results, it was reasonable to postulate that regions of residues 466–479 and 516–531 might contain structural elements that are necessary for the interaction with rhodopsin. To further narrow the sequences, we introduced point mutations into GRK2-CC at residues that are conserved among GRKs. A conserved proline-rich motif within 468–479 was found indispensable (Fig. 3C). When the four proline residues (Pro-467/Pro-468/Pro-469/Pro-472) were mutated to alanines, this mutant (4PA) lost the ability to interact with rhodopsin (Fig. 3D). The other mutations had little effect (listed in Fig. 3C). Because point mutations within the sequence between 516 and 531 are not effective, the effect seen with the deletion of residues 516–531 may be caused by structural alteration of GRK2-CC. To investigate whether the proline-rich region of other GRKs is also involved in their interactions with rhodopsin, a GRK1-CC mutant (3PA) containing mutations for the three corresponding Pro residues (P467A/P468A/P471A) and a GRK5-CC mutant (3PA) containing substitution of Ala for Pro-463/Pro-464/Pro-467 were constructed and expressed as GST fusion proteins (The position of the proline residues is underlined in Fig. 1). Interactions of these fusion proteins with rhodopsin were then examined. As shown in Fig. 3E, both GRK1-CC-3PA and GRK5-CC-3PA cannot bind the light-activated rhodopsin, demonstrating that the conserved proline-rich motif of GRKs plays a key role in the interaction between CC and rhodopsin. Effects of the Point Mutation of the Four Proline Residues in GRK-2 on the Kinase Activity—Our previous work has demonstrated that GRK2-CC is required for GRK-2 to phosphorylate rhodopsin (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is interesting to determine the role of the proline-rich motif in GRK-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin. We generated a GRK-2 mutant (GRK2–4PA) in which the four proline residues were mutated to alanines. GRK2–4PA was expressed in E. coli, purified to homogeneity (data not shown), and tested for its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin and the peptide substrate. As shown in Fig. 4A, GRK2–4PA completely lost the ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin, whereas it can phosphorylate the peptide substrate as the wild-type GRK-2 does (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the mutations have no significant effect on the activity and the conformation of the kinase catalytic domain of the enzyme. In addition, 329G-Rho*, a truncated form of rhodopsin in which the GRK phosphorylation site is removed, can still markedly activate GRKs' catalytic activity for a peptide substrate (25Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncated Rho* can also activate GRK2–4PA, although the activation is weaker than that of the wild-type GRK-2 (Fig. 4C). All these characteristics are similar to those observed with GRK2-ΔCC (deletion of the residues 457–545) as described previously (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based on these results, we conclude that the proline-rich motif in CC is critically involved in the interaction between CC and rhodopsin and that this motif is necessary for GRKs to phosphorylate its protein substrate rhodopsin. CC of GRKs Interacts Only with the Light-activated Rhodopsin—Knowing that GRKs preferentially recognize and phosphorylate the activated (agonist bound) but not the non-activated GPCRs (1Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether CC specifically interacts with the activated rhodopsin. As shown in Fig. 5A, CC of GRK-1, GRK-2 and GRK-5 all bound to only the light-activated but not the non-activated, rhodopsin. We also examined the interaction between the N-terminal domain (1∼189 amino acids) of GRK-2 and rhodopsin. When rhodopsin was pretreated with 1% Triton X-100, the interaction between the N-terminal domain of GRK-2 and rhodopsin could be detected in a light-independent manner (Fig. 5B). We have demonstrated previously that the C-terminal conserved region (CC) of GRK-2 participates in the interaction with rhodopsin and that this interaction is necessary for GRK-2-mediated receptor phosphorylation (27Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we further demonstrated that the CC of all GRKs can interact with rhodopsin as a substrate and that this region seems to specifically recognize the light-activated but not the non-activated rhodopsin. The recently solved crystal structure of GRK-2 in complex with G protein β1γ2 subunits has provided a basis to look at our results in a structural context. The CC region (residues 457–546) comprises the C-terminal part (residues 457–513; from the αJ helix to the C-terminal end) of the kinase domain and the second half of the regulator of G protein signaling homology domain (residues 514–546) in the structure of GRK-2 (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The C-terminal portion of the kinase domain contains the functionally important nucleotide gate (residues 476–495), which was disordered in the GRK-2 structure. The nucleotide gate is located on the membrane-proximal side of the GRK2-Gβγ complex and is one of the three primary regions in GRK-2 that is responsible for discrimination of the non-active and the stimulated receptors and/or membrane targeting (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In this work, the proline-rich motif in the CC region of GRKs was found to be critical for the recognition and interaction of GRKs with rhodopsin. Proline-rich motif in proteins has been known to function as a ligand sequence that binds protein modules such as SH3, WW, and several other protein-interacting domains, and these proline-rich motif-mediated protein-protein interactions are important in many signaling pathways (35Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar, 36Oneyama C. Agatsuma T. Kanda Y. Nakano H. Sharma S.V. Nakano S. Narazaki F. Tatsuta K. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the GRK-2 structure, the conserved proline residues form a hydrophobic patch on the surface and their backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms have the potential to form hydrogen-bonding interactions (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In other words, the proline-rich motif of GRK-2 presents an easily accessible hydrophobic surface as well as a good hydrogen-bonding site for protein-protein interaction. Therefore, it is possible that the proline-rich motif of GRKs recognize and interact directly with rhodopsin. On the other hand, because the proline-rich motif forms a loop connecting the αJ helix (residues 458–464) and the disordered nucleotide gate (residues 476–495) of the kinase domain (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and proline has a rigid stereochemical conformation with less flexibility, it is also possible that the rigidity of the proline-rich motif might be needed to constrain and/or modulate the conformation and/or position of αJ helix and the nucleotide gate (and the overall conformation of the CC region and the kinase domain in the enzyme). Mutations of prolines to alanines in this motif would apparently alter this constraint and allow more flexibility, which would conceivably disrupt the interaction of the CC region with rhodopsin and abolish the ability of GRK-2 to catalyze rhodopsin phosphorylation. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive; rather, they probably work in a concerted way. The finding that neither the N-terminal nor the CC deletion mutant of GRK-2 affects its ability to phosphorylate the peptide substrate (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Yu Q.M. Pei G. Li L. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue. Bao. (Shanghai). 1999; 31: 648-652PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that neither of these regions is required for the intrinsic catalytic activity. On the other hand, the failure of these deletion mutants to phosphorylate rhodopsin indicates that both regions have a role in phosphorylating GPCR substrates. The N-terminal domain of GRKs has been thought to recognize activated receptors (2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). However, our results from this work strongly suggest that CC within the C-terminal domain of GRKs has this function, because CC binds only the activated rhodopsin, whereas the N-terminal domain of GRK-2 binds rhodopsin independent of its activation state. In addition, the interaction of the N-terminal domain, but not CC, with rhodopsin in the membrane preparation depends on Triton X-100 pretreatment, suggesting that the N-terminal domain might not have access to intact rhodopsin. Thus, the interaction between the N-terminal domain and rhodopsin is likely to be secondary to that between CC and rhodopsin. In other words, the interaction of CC with rhodopsin may induce a conformational change in rhodopsin that may be recapitulated by the Triton treatment, and this change may thus allow the binding of the N-terminal domain to rhodopsin. This idea is further supported by the observation that CC, but not the N-terminal domain (data not shown), of GRK-2 inhibits GRK-2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin. The finding that G329-Rho* can weakly activate the CC deletion mutant but not the N-terminal domain deletion mutant (29Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Li Z. Liu F. Pei G. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 37Gan X.Q. Wang J.Y. Yang Q.H. Yu Q.M. Pei G. Li L. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue. Bao. (Shanghai). 1999; 31: 648-652PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that the interaction of rhodopsin with the N-terminal GRK domain may have a role in GRK activation by its substrate. According to the recently solved crystal structure of GRK-2, the kinase domain is in an inactive conformation, and conformational changes of both rhodopsin and GRKs are expected to occur during the recognition and the phosphorylation of the receptor (26Shi W. Osawa S. Dickerson C.D. Weiss E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2112-2119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the α4-α5 loop of the regulator of G protein signaling homology domain bundle subdomain that forms an interface with the αJ helix of the kinase large lobe. Interaction of the N-terminal domain with the activated receptor may affect this interface and modulate GRK-2 activity by influencing the relative orientation of the kinase small and large lobes (28Lodowski D.T. Pitcher J.A. Capel W.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1256-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that the N-terminal domain may contribute to regulate the intrinsic activity of the kinase domain. In summary, our results have demonstrated that the conserved C-terminal region of all GRKs may interact with their GPCR substrates and that this region seems to specifically recognize the light-activated but not the non-activated rhodopsin. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have further identified a proline-rich motif within the CC as the key structural element required for the interaction. GRKs and G proteins are the only known protein families that interact with the activated forms of GPCRs. Structural studies of these proteins could therefore provide insights into the common structural characteristics of activated GPCRs. Our finding that a conserved fragment of GRK-2 (residues 466–531), especially a proline-rich motif within the CC of GRKs, is required for the interaction of GRKs with activated GPCRs may help to identify possible consensus structural features of the activated GPCRs via structural studies.

Here, in experiments on control oocytes and oocytes overexpressing a cloned NCX1 cardiac protein, confocal microscopy combined with electrophysiological techniques reveal that these cells express an endogenous NCX protein forming a functional microdomain with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) that controls intracellular Ca2+ in a restricted subplasmalemmal space. The following data obtained in control denuded oocytes are consistent with this view: (i) reverse transcription-PCR revealed that the oocyte expresses two transcripts for the NCX1 and NCX3 isoforms; (ii) immunofluorescence experiments showed that native NCX1 and InsP3Rs are largely codistributed in discrete areas of the plasma membrane in close apposition to the cortical endoplasmic reticulum shell; (iii) when stimulated by rabbit serum, which elevates intracellular Ca2+ mediated by InsP3, voltage-clamped oocytes display a large and transient inward Ca2+-activated chloride current, ICl(Ca), as a result of the Ca2+ rise at the inner surface membrane; (iv) this current is significantly enhanced by KB-R7943 and by an extracellular sodium-depleted medium, two maneuvers that prevent “Ca2+ extrusion” via NCX; and (v) blocking NCX enhanced the ICl(Ca) elicited by InsP3 but not by Ca2+ photolysis in oocytes injected with the respective caged compounds. Moreover, overexpression of cardiac NCX1, confirmed by confocal microscopy, has functional consequences for the “Ca2+ influx” but not for the serum-elicited “Ca2+ efflux” mode of basal exchange activity and does not alter the number of endogenous NCX/InsP3Rs colocalization sites. Our results suggest that native NCX, because of its strategic position, may regulate InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling during the early phases of oocyte maturation and/or fertilization, and furthermore foreign cardiac protein is excluded from the Ca2+ microdomains surrounding the native NCX/InsP3Rs complex in the oocyte.

The transient nature of [Ca2+]i is essential to the progression of the meiotic cell cycle and to fertilization in oocytes from Xenopus laevis frogs and other animal species (1Busa W.B. Nuccitelli R.

One of the most efficient systems in bringing the [Ca2+]i to resting level in many excitable and non-excitable cells is the plasmalemmal Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX); however, its contribution (if any) to [Ca2+]i homeostasis in other cell types including Xenopus oocytes seems to be very scarce. This conclusion is derived from previous immunocytochemical and functional studies suggesting that NCX is not localized in the plasma membrane of the oocyte but is found in the surrounding follicular cells (10Longoni S. Coady M.J. Ikeda T. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C870-C873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hilgemann D.W. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D.

Biol. 1991; 145: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, the belief that frog oocytes lack an endogenous exchanger mechanism has been one of the main arguments for their extensive use as a model for heterologous expression and study of foreign NCX genes cloned from different tissues (12Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 13Nicoll D.A. Hryshko L.V. Matsuoka S. Frank J.S. Philipson K.D. J. Biol.

However, based on new evidence, the proposal of an endogenous NCX mechanism in frog oocytes cannot be entirely rejected. Thus, the existence of a “reverse” mode of NCX activity in these cells has been reported (17Schlief T. Heinemann H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 486: 123-130Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar); the study shows that H2O2 induces the Ca2+ influx mediated by a Na+-Ca2+ exchange. The major drawback to this study is that H2O2 is far from being a physiological stimulus for the oocyte. Their preliminary data, besides the discovery of an active plasmalemmal NCX in hamster, mouse, and porcine oocytes (18Igusa Y. Miyazaki S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1983; 340: 611-632Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 19Pepperell J.R. Kommineni K. Buradagunta S. Smith P.J. Keefe D.L. Biol.

Reprod. 2002; 67: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), moved us to reevaluate if the same is actually true in Xenopus oocytes. Three circumstances may have hampered the identification of a native NCX in frog oocytes: 1) the low density of the protein at the plasma membrane, 2) the lack of specific inhibitors for the exchanger, and 3) the use of inappropriate stimuli to assay this exchange mechanism in this particular cell type. Regarding the latter circumstance, it is important to understand how the native protein would preferably work under physiological conditions. In fact, the possibility exists that the exchanger, which requires the energy of the Na+ gradient created by the Na+ pump, can move Ca2+ either into or out of the cell depending on the net electrochemical driving force. If during development and meiotic maturation oocytes are in a Na+-rich medium at negative plasma membrane potentials, the extrusion of Ca2+ in exchange for the entry movement of Na+ would be favored. Nevertheless, it should be noted that under special circumstances and in some types of cells, including oocytes, the transporter might operate in the “Ca2+ entry” mode and play a critical role in mediating Ca2+ influx rather than efflux (21Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Numerous observations suggest that the bulk of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and [Ca2+]i elevation in response to Xenopus oocyte activation occurs via the InsP3Rs preferentially located on the ER periphery (8Han J.K. Nucitelli R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1103-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 22Nuccitelli R. Yim D.L. Smart T. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 200-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 23Parys J.B. Sernett S.W. Delisle S. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Campbell K.B. J. Biol.

Therefore, it can be inferred that if oocytes possess an active plasmalemmal NCX mechanism, the stimuli that promote Ca2+ mobilization from InsP3-sensitive internal stores and the consequent [Ca2+]i rise at the inner oocyte surface membrane in the vicinity of the exchanger would activate Ca2+ extrusion via NCX. If this hypothesis is true, rabbit serum, which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ by activating the phosphatidylinositol phosphate signaling pathway in these cells (26Tigyi G. Dyer D. Matute C. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), would be an excellent candidate to explore the “Ca2+ efflux” mode activity of a putative NCX endogenously expressed by the oocytes. In this framework we have planned the present study to investigate whether such an exchange mechanism actually exists in fully grown Xenopus oocytes and its possible interaction with the InsP3-sensitive internal Ca2+ stores in the control of [Ca2+]i homeostasis. We have employed new experimental approaches to resolve this old problem. Thus, we selected a stimulus like rabbit serum, which faithfully reproduces the physiological cycle of the calcium signal in the oocyte; we also employed the thiourea derivative KB-R7943 for its well recognized efficacy and potency in blocking different NCX subtypes (16Iwamoto T. Shigekawa M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C423-C430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iwamoto T. Watano T. Shigekawa M. J. Biol.

Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) for comparisons with control oocytes. Our study of both groups of oocytes has combined molecular biology with confocal microscopic, electrophysiological, and biochemical techniques. Finally, by performing photolysis of caged Ca2+ or caged InsP3 in control oocytes, we studied how the source of the internal Ca2+ release may affect the activity of the native exchanger.

Philipson from the University of California, Los Angeles) was linearized with HindIII and transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase using the mCAP RNA capping Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mature female X. laevis frogs were obtained from CRBM du CNRS (Montpellier, France) and anesthetized with 0.125% tricaine solution; frogs were allowed to recover after surgical removal of small pieces of ovary. Follicle-enclosed oocytes were manually isolated and incubated overnight at 16 °C in a modified Barth's solution with gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml) and sodium pyruvate (5 mm). The next day, healthy stage V and VI oocytes (33Dumont J.N. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar) were injected with 50 nl of cRNA (1 μg/μl). 24 h later injected and non-injected oocytes were defolliculated by collagenase treatment and manually. To guarantee that oocytes used for the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR or immunocytochemistry experiments were fully defolliculated, they were additionally rolled over poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (34Miledi R. Woodward R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 416: 601-621Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Oocytes were maintained at 16 °C in modified Barth's solution for 3–5 days and then visualized under the confocal microscope or used for electrophysiological recordings and/or assayed for Ca2+ influx traffic in exchange for efflux of intracellular Na+, [Na+]i. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from denuded oocytes or from manually peeled oocyte follicular layers using the Ultraspec RNA isolation kit (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl of reaction sample using random primers and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was initiated (40 cycles, 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min) using 4 μl of the RT reaction and the Taq polymerase (Qiagen, Inc.). Two pairs of primers (from 5′ to 3′) were used to amplify products corresponding to the NCX1 and NCX2 isoforms from Xenopus laevis oocytes or from the follicular cells. The first pair of primers was designed based on the nucleotide sequence of a region highly conserved in the two NCX1 clones identified in the frog heart (35Iwata T. Kraev A. Gurini D. Carafoli E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 15: 37-45Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A region of high homology between the two NCX2 isoforms of rat and human brain was used to design the second pair of primers (36Li Z. Matsuoka S. Hryshko L.V. Nicoll D.A. Bersohn M.M. Burke E.P.

Numbers in brackets indicate the GenBank™ accession number [before] and initial position of the primer (after) the sequence: NCX1 [Q91850] sense 5′-TTT GAA GAA GAT GAG AAT TT (1396) and antisense 5′-TCA AAG TCT TCT CCT CCA C (1706). NCX2 [Q9UPR5] sense 5′-GCA CCA GCA GAA GAG CCG (1125) and antisense 5′-GCC CAT GCA CTC GCT CCA (1710). PCR samples were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel using a 100-bp DNA ladder as molecular weight marker (Biotools B&M Labs). The above primers were expected to amplify two DNA fragments of 311 bp (corresponding to the NCX1 isoform) and 586 bp (NCX2 isoform). PCR products were extracted using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.) and sequenced by the big dye method and the automatic sequencer ABI PRISM 377 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Imaging of Follicular Cells—Immunodetection of NCX in follicular cells was performed in sections of non-injected follicle-enclosed oocytes from donors whose denuded oocytes lack native NCX activity (this activity is assayed in the corresponding electrophysiological section of “Results”). Oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4), dehydrated in a graded alcohol series, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm-thick sections. Deparaffinized sections were incubated for 1 h with 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 4% normal goat serum, and 0.02% sodium azide in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against the canine cardiac NCX1 (diluted 1:500). Samples were washed in PBS three times for 10 min each wash and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200), washed in PBS buffer, and mounted in Glycergel medium (DAKO Corporation). Samples treated as described above (except for incubation with the primary antibody) were used for negative controls. Sections were examined with the Leica TCS SP2 Spectral confocal laser scanning microscope as described below. Immunolabeling of Oocytes, Colocalization Analysis, and Confocal Laser-scanning Microscopy—Intact defolliculated oocytes were used for immunodetection of InsP3R and/or NCX. Double immunolabeling of both proteins was carried out in non-injected oocytes (control) or in oocytes previously injected (3–5 days before) with the cardiac NCX1 cRNA. Oocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4), extensively washed with 3% bovine serum albumin in the same buffer, and permeabilized and blocked for 1 h with 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After overnight incubation with the goat polyclonal anti-InsP3R-I antibody (1:50) at 4 °C, followed by the AlexaFluor 546 donkey anti-goat IgG (1:200) for 3 h at room temperature, oocytes were extensively washed. Subsequently, oocytes were incubated with the primary and secondary antibodies against the cardiac NCX1 following the protocol described above for follicular cells. Oocytes treated as above but not incubated with primary antibodies were simultaneously used as negative controls. In some experiments, intact oocytes were immunolabeled with anti-NCX1 but not with anti-InsP3R antibodies. Oocytes were mounted in glycerol/buffer (70:30) under a glass coverslip on a glass dual-well slide. The slide was fastened upside down on the stage of the Leica confocal laser scanning microscope and visualized with a ×20 or ×40 lens. Fluorophores AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 546 were excited at 488 nm and 543 nm using an argon ion and He-Ne laser, respectively, whereas fluorescence was detected at 530 nm and 590 nm. All images were captured using the Leica Confocal software at the same adjustments of laser intensity and photomultiplier sensitivity and were later processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software using identical contrast and brightness values for both control and injected oocytes. The colocalization analysis was performed using the “colocalization function” of the Leica TCS SP2 Spectral system described elsewhere (38Demandolx D. Davoust J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1997; 185: 21-36Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Focal series of horizontal planes (Z-scan) from the top of the oocyte surface spaced at 2 μm were monitored simultaneously for both fluorescent probes. The images registered from the same confocal plane for both the green and the red signals were saved and superimposed. For every pixel in the original image, the system plots a corresponding point related to the intensities of the green and red channels. On the resulting cytofluorogram, the x axis represents the intensity of pixels in the green channel, and the y axis represents the intensity of pixels in the red channel. If a pixel has equal intensity in both channels, then that pixel point will fall on the diagonal of the graph. The farther away the points are from the diagonal line, the higher the intensity is for one channel compared with the other. By selecting a constant elliptical area on the cytofluorogram around the 45° line it is possible exclude the background signals; pixels with high intensities in both channels were captured and visualized as white. Data were collected as the number of double-labeled white pixels per region of interest (ROI). Electrophysiology in Xenopus Oocytes—Oocytes were impaled by two microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl and voltage-clamped at -60 mV using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725-B Warner Instrument Corporation, Hamden, CT) as described previously (30Herrero C.J.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 377-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oocyte was held in a 0.3-ml-volume chamber and constantly superfused by gravity (4 ml/min) with Ringer's solution. This technique allows us to determine the [Ca2+]i rise at the inner surface membrane of oocytes by recording the Ca2+-dependent chloride current (ICl(Ca)), and indirectly the resulting “Ca2+ efflux” mode of NCX activity. Pulses of diluted rabbit serum or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the absence or presence of KB-R7943 was applied using a set of 2-mm-diameter glass tubes located close to the surface of the oocytes. Experiments replacing external Na+ with N-methyl-d-glucamine used a chamber with agar bridges. Pulses and data acquisition was controlled using a Digidata 1200 Interface and CLAMPEX software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Light-flash Photolysis of Caged Ca2+ or Caged InsP3 in Oocytes—The technique for photolysis of caged Ca2+ or InsP3 in oocytes and the consequent activation of the Ca2+-dependent chloride current, ICl(Ca), has been described elsewhere (31Pintado A.J. Herrero C.J. García A.G. Montiel C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Herrero C.J. Alés E. Pintado A.J. López M.G. García-Palomero E. Mahata S.K.

Pharmacol. 1997; 332: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, to maximize ICl(Ca) the animal hemisphere at latitude 20–40° of the oocyte was injected with 41 nl of caged Ca2+ (45 mm CaCl2) or caged InsP3 (1 mm InsP3) compounds prepared in a medium containing 50 mm DM-nitrophen and 5 mm HEPES at pH 7 (40Miledi R. Parker I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 357: 173-183Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). After 30 min of equilibrium in the dark, voltage-clamped oocytes were stimulated with repetitive flashes of UV light using a high intensity Xenon flash lamp (Cairn Research, Ltd., Faversham, Kent, UK). The capacitance value was 2000 μF charged to 200 V. Light was focused onto the vegetal oocyte surface using a light guide. Repetitive flashes of constant intensity and duration were given to the oocyte every 4 min; flashes were controlled by a PC computer using the CLAMPEX software. Calcium Flux Experiments—The “Ca2+ influx” mode of NCX activity was determined measuring the [Na+]i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake in Na+-loaded oocytes as described previously (10Longoni S. Coady M.J. Ikeda T. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C870-C873Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nicoll D.A. Longoni S. Philipson K.D. Science. 1990; 250: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Briefly, [Na+]i rose upon incubating oocytes during 40 min at 4 °C in a Ca2+-free modified Barth's solution containing 30 μm nystatin. After extensively rinsing the drug away with saline medium, the [Na+]i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was initiated by exposure of the oocytes during 10 min at 37 °C to a medium containing 90 mm KCl (total [Na+]i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake) or 90 mm NaCl (basal [Na+]i-independent 45Ca2+ uptake) plus 20 mm HEPES and 10 μm CaCl2 (2.5 μCi/ml of 45CaCl2) at pH 7.4. The reaction was stopped with a solution containing 90 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, at pH 7.4. The 45Ca2+ content in single oocytes was determined in scintillation vials containing 500 μl NaOH (1 m); vials had been heated at 120 °C for 20 min prior to the 45Ca2+ determination. Net [Na+]i-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was obtained upon subtracting basal from total uptake values. Materials and Solutions—All products not specified were purchased from Sigma. The anti-cardiac NCX1 antibody was obtained from Swant; the anti-InsP3R-I antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and AlexaFluor 546 donkey anti-goat IgG were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). KB-R7943 was kindly provided by Pharmaceutical Research Laboratories, Kanebo Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). 45Ca2+ was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and liquid scintillation Optiphase Hisafe 2 is from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The caged compounds were purchased from Calbiochem. KB-R7943 was stored at -20 °C as a stock solution (10-2m) diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Also stock water solutions (10-4m) of LPA and rabbit serum were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. A final concentration of all compounds was prepared in Ringer's solution. Nystatin solution was prepared from a fresh stock solution (10 mm) in Me2SO. The sodium-free Ringer's solution was prepared by substituting sodium with an equimolar concentration of N-methyl-d-glucamine. Statistical Analysis—Statistics of the average fluorescence intensity, number of pixels containing both maximal fluorescence for both proteins in a determined area (ROI), or the concentration of KB-R7943 eliciting 50% blockade (IC50) of the maximal Na+-gradient-dependent 45Ca2+ uptake was estimated through non-linear regression analysis using the four-parameter logistic equation of the GraphPad Prism software on a personal computer. Pooled results were expressed as means ± S.E. The criterion for significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Different NCX Isoforms Are Expressed in the Oocyte and in the Follicular Cells—Using NCX2 primers, RT-PCR of RNA isolated from denuded Xenopus laevis oocytes or from surrounding follicular cells failed to detect any transcript for this isoform of the protein (data not shown). In contrast, an expected 311-bp band was amplified in both types of cells using specific primers for the NCX1 isoform (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, the same primers amplified a second unexpected 499-bp product in the oocyte but not in the follicular cells (Fig. 1A). In all cases, potential contamination of genomic DNA was ruled out by performing the RT-PCR in the absence of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1, A and B, right lines). Sequence analysis of the 311-bp product amplified in both types of cells was indistinguishable; moreover, the product displays an amino acid identity of 100 and 91%, respectively, to the two partial NCX1 clones (Q91850 and Q91849) identified previously in Xenopus heart. Because of its small size and its identification in oocytes we have named it “NCX-so.” Amplification of a second 499-bp band in denuded oocytes was a surprise; we called it “NCX-lo” because of its size, larger than expected, and its being first identified in oocytes (GenBank™ accession number AY753310). 2The PCR product NCX-lo (GenBank™ accessio"

Efficient cleavage of DNA only in the presence of Ca2+ ions, comparable with that of Mg2+, is previously not described. Most intriguingly, KpnI REase exhibits Ca2+-dependent specific DNA cleavage. Moreover, the enzyme is highly promiscuous in its cleavage pattern on plasmid DNAs in the presence of Mn2+ or Mg2+, with the complete suppression of promiscuous activity in the presence of Ca2+. KpnI methyltransferase does not exhibit promiscuous activity unlike its cognate REase. The REase binds to oligonucleotides containing canonical and mapped noncanonical sites with comparable affinities. However, the extent of cleavage is varied depending on the metal ion and the sequence. The ability of the enzyme to be promiscuous or specific may reflect an evolutionary design. Based on the results, we suggest that the enzyme KpnI represents an REase evolving to attain higher sequence specificity from an ancient nonspecific nuclease.

Based on the results, we suggest that the enzyme KpnI represents an REase evolving to attain higher sequence specificity from an ancient nonspecific nuclease. Type II REases recognize specific DNA sequences, which vary from 4 to 8 bp and cleave both the strands in Mg2+-dependent reaction. They exhibit remarkable features in discriminating between specific and nonspecific DNA, not only in DNA binding but also during DNA cleavage (1Roberts R.J. Halford S.E. Linn S.M. Lloyd R.S. Roberts R.J. Nucleases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 35-88Google Scholar). Based on the divalent metal ion requirement for DNA binding, REases have been classified into two groups (2Gormley N.A. Bath A.J. Halford S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6928-6936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, EcoRI, BamHI, RsrI, and a few other enzymes bind to DNA preferentially at their recognition sites in the absence of divalent metal ions (3Lesser D.R. Kurpiewski M.R. Waters T.

In contrast, EcoRV, PvuII, TaqI, and a few other enzymes bind to cognate sequences in a divalent metal ion-dependent manner (6, Taylor, J. D., Badcoe, I. G., Clarke, A. R., and Halford, S. E. (1991) 30, 8743–8753Google Scholar, 7Zebala J.A. Choi J. Barany F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8097-8105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lagunavicius A. Grazulis S. Balciunaite E. Vainius D. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11093-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, both the groups of enzymes need Mg2+ for catalysis. The role of metal ions in DNA binding and the subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond at the recognition site have been studied in detail for several REases. 1The abbreviations used are: REase, restriction endonuclease; MTase, methyltransferase. Although the natural cofactor for all type II REases is Mg2+, Ca2+ can replace Mg2+ for specific DNA binding, without leading to the formation of productive complex (9Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Some type II REases form stable protein-DNA complexes in the presence of Ca2+ but do not support the DNA cleavage even though Ca2+ is a nearly perfect analogue for Mg2+ (10Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Ca2+ also increases the binding specificity of several REases such as MunI, TaqI, and Cfr10I toward their cognate sites (9Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Skirgaila R. Siksnys V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 595-598PubMed Google Scholar). Several type II REases show reduced sequence specificity at suboptimal reaction conditions such as low ionic strength, elevated pH, in the presence of water-miscible solvents, and when Mg2+ is substituted with Mn2+. This relaxed specificity was first observed for EcoRI REase and termed as star activity (12Polisky B. Greene P. Garfin D.E. McCarthy B.J. Goodman H.M. Boyer H.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3310-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Subsequently, relaxed specificity has been characterized for several REases such as BamHI (13Xu S.Y. Schildkraut I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4425-4429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), DdeI (14Makula R.A. Meagher R.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3125-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), EcoRV (15Halford S.E. Lovelady B.M. McCallum S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 41: 173-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), PvuII (16Nasri M. Thomas D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7677-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and RsrI (17Aiken C. Gumport R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7901-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). KpnI REase isolated from Klebsiella pneumoniae recognizes the palindromic double-stranded DNA sequence 5′-GGTAC↓C-3′ and cleaves DNA by generating a 3′, 4-base overhang (18Tomassini J. Roychoudhury R. Wu R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4055-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme binds to specific DNA in the absence of divalent metal ions (19Chandrashekaran S. Babu P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. (Bangalore). 1999; 24: 269-277Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe the highly promiscuous cleavage of DNA in the presence of Mg2+ and Mn2+. The promiscuous activity is completely suppressed in the presence of Ca2+, which induces site-specific DNA cleavage. Enzymes and DNA—KpnI REase was purified as described previously (18Tomassini J. Roychoudhury R. Wu R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4055-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The enzyme was diluted in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for all the studies. The concentration of the enzyme was estimated by the method of Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). One unit of KpnI REase is defined as the amount of enzyme required for complete digestion of 1 μgof λDNA at 37 °C for 1 h by using assay buffer containing 5 mm Mg2+. T4 polynucleotide kinase and Klenow polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were from Microsynth Inc., Switzerland, and purified on 18% urea-polyacrylamide gel (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 35-88Google Scholar). The purified oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol). Pfu and Taq DNA polymerases, pUC18 and pBR322, were obtained from Bangalore Genei Pvt. Ltd., India. The plasmid clones used for primer extension studies were from the laboratory collections. REase Digestion—Standard assay conditions involved lower enzyme units to DNA ratio (up to 10 units of enzyme), whereas in relaxed assay conditions more than 15 units of enzyme were used. Digestions were carried out by incubating different units of KpnI REase with plasmid DNA or 0.2 pmol of labeled oligonucleotides in assay buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and appropriate concentrations of divalent metal ions at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were terminated by adding stop dye containing 0.6% SDS and 25 mm EDTA. The cleavage products of plasmid DNA and oligonucleotides were analyzed on 1% agarose or 12% urea-polyacrylamide gel, respectively. The Ca2+ chase reactions were carried out at a fixed concentration of Mg2+ (2 mm) or Mn2+ (0.5 mm) by using increasing concentrations of Ca2+. Primer Extension Analysis—The different plasmids (2 μg) were incubated with 20 units of KpnI REase in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mm Mn2+ at 37 °C for 1 h. The digested plasmids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, and end-labeled primers were used for primer extension reaction as described by Balke et al. (22Balke V. Nagaraja V. Gindlesperger T. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The cleavage sites were mapped by standard dideoxy sequencing reactions using TaqDNA polymerase (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). DNA Binding Assay—Different concentrations of KpnI REase (12–1200 nm for noncanonical sites; 3–500 nm KpnI for cognate sites) were incubated with 3.75 nm of end-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing cognate and noncognate sites in the buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) on ice for 15 min. The free DNA and enzyme-bound complexes were separated on 8% native polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. The amounts of DNA in free and bound form were quantitated using PhosphorImager, and the results were analyzed by Scatchard plot. Metal Ion-dependent Cleavage Reactions—The effect of divalent metal ions on the activity of KpnI REase was studied by using plasmid DNA as substrates. KpnI REase exhibits relaxed specificity at high enzyme to substrate ratios. A high degree of promiscuous activity was observed when more than 15 units of the enzyme was used in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1A). The promiscuous activity was further enhanced in the presence of Mn2+ as compared with Mg2+ under similar reaction conditions (Fig. 1B). This activity of the enzyme was observed at a range of Mg2+ (1–5 mm) or Mn2+ (0.5–5 mm) concentrations and was more pronounced than the conventional star activity exhibited by several type II REases. Most surprisingly, unlike other type II REases, KpnI REase exhibits specific DNA cleavage in presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1C) showing greater specificity even at high enzyme to substrate ratios in contrast to the cleavage pattern with Mg2+ and Mn2+. The Ca2+-mediated high fidelity, efficient DNA cleavage is a unique property of KpnI REase. In the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, the enzyme exhibited promiscuous cleavage with pBR322 that lacks the specific KpnI recognition sequence (supplemental Fig. 1). KpnI MTase Does Not Exhibit Promiscuous Behavior—In order to assess the promiscuous activity of KpnI on methylated DNA and to evaluate whether the MTase exhibits promiscuous behavior, both pUC18 and pUCΔK (pUCΔK was generated by deleting the KpnI site from pUC18 by digesting with EcoRI and HindIII) were isolated from Escherichia coli DH10B harboring KpnI MTase expressing plasmid, pACMK (18Tomassini J. Roychoudhury R. Wu R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 4055-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The methylated pUC18 DNA was not cleaved at a canonical site by the KpnI REase under standard assay conditions (1–10 units of enzyme). However, under relaxed conditions both pUC18 and pUCΔK DNA isolated from KpnI MTase expressing cells exhibited promiscuous cleavage patterns by KpnI REase in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 1, D and E). From these results, we infer that the MTase does not exhibit promiscuous activity as only the cognate site was methylated. Furthermore, the modification of the cognate site has no influence on the promiscuous activity of the REase. Relaxed cleavage specificity was observed only in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+, and the modified DNA substrates were refractile to cleavage by KpnI REase in the presence of Ca2+. Suppression of Promiscuous Activity—It has been shown by a large number of biochemical and structural studies with several type II REases that Mg2+ and Ca2+ occupy the same pocket in the active site (24Horton J.R. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G. Greci J. Schildkraut I. Phillips S.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5466-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Lukacs C.M. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct.

High fidelity cleavage in the presence of Ca2+, irrespective of the enzyme concentrations and robust promiscuity at low concentrations of the enzyme in the presence of low amounts of Mg2+ (2 mm) and Mn2+ (0.5 mm), prompted us to carry out competition experiments between the different metal ions. In order to assess the effect of Ca2+ on Mg2+- and Mn2+-dependent promiscuous activity of KpnI REase, Ca2+ chase experiments were carried on Mg2+-or Mn2+-bound enzyme-DNA complex under relaxed conditions. The Mg2+- or Mn2+-mediated promiscuous activity was completely suppressed by an increase in Ca2+ ion concentrations (Fig. 2, A and B). In a converse experiment with fixed amounts of Ca2+ (2 mm) and increasing concentrations of Mg2+ or Mn2+, the promiscuous activity of the enzyme was restored (data not shown). These observations indicate that Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+ compete with each other to occupy the active site of the enzyme. Binding and Cleavage Analysis of KpnI REase with Oligonucleotide Containing Noncanonical Sites—Primer extension strategy was used to map the noncanonical sites, and the representative data are shown in the supplemental Fig. 2. Analysis of the data obtained from primer extension products of different plasmid substrates revealed that many hexameric sequences with one nucleotide change from the canonical sequence are efficient cleavage sites. The sequences that have been mapped include tGTACC, GtTACC, GaTACC, GGaACC, GGTcCC, GGTAtC, GGTACg, and GGTACt, where the lowercase letter indicates noncanonical nucleotide. The cleavage position within each of these noncanonical recognition sequences was identical to that observed with the canonical sequence. The relaxation in the specificity of KpnI occurred at every nucleotide position within the hexameric recognition sequence. To study the DNA binding properties of KpnI at noncanonical sites, several oligonucleotides were designed based on the results from the primer extension data (Table I). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing different mapped sites with one of the strands labeled at the 5′ end were used as substrates for binding studies. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out in the absence of divalent metal ions, and the representative results are shown in Fig. 3. KpnI REase formed a single protein-DNA complex with oligonucleotide containing GGTACC (canonical site) and GGaACC and GGatCC (noncanonical sites) sequences (Fig. 3, A, C and D). All other noncanonical sequence containing oligonucleotides described above also formed similar complexes (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that the affinity of the enzyme to the various oligonucleotides varied from 8 to 34 nm (Table II). KpnI REase failed to show a stable complex with a completely nonspecific oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B) as observed earlier (19Chandrashekaran S. Babu P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. (Bangalore). 1999; 24: 269-277Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Table IThe list of oligonucleotides used for binding and cleavage studies of KpnICanonical oligonucleotide5′-ATTGCGTGGTACCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGTACCACGCAAT-3′Noncanonical oligonucleotides5′-ATTGCGTGaTACCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGTAtCACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTGGaACCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGTtCCACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTGtTACCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGTAaCACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTGGTcCCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGgACCACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTGGTACgCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGcGTACCACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTtGTACCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGTACaACGCAAT-3′5′-ATTGCGTGGatCCCGCTCTT-3′5′-AAGAGCGGGatCCACGCAAT-3′Nonspecific oligonucleotide5′-GAGAGGCGGTTTGCGTATTGGGCGCTCTTCCGCTTCCT-35′-AGGAAGCGGAAGACGCCCAATACGCAAACCGCCTCTC-3′ Open table in a new tab Table IIDNA binding affinities of KpnI REase for different oligonucleotidesRecognition sequenceKdnm-GGTACC-8-GaTACC-13-GtTACC-13-GGTcCC-18-tGTACC-18-GGaACC-28-GGTACg-31-GGatCC-34 Open table in a new tab Cleavage reactions were carried out using double-stranded oligonucleotides in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ as a cofactor. KpnI REase cleaves oligonucleotides containing various noncanonical sites having single nucleotide substitution, albeit less efficiently when compared with the cleavage with oligonucleotides containing canonical sequence (Fig. 4A). Noncanonical sites GtTACC, GaTACC, and GGTcCC were preferred over GGaACC, tGTACC, and GGTACg (Fig. 4A). No DNA cleavage was detected at the noncanonical sites in the presence of Ca2+ even at a high enzyme to substrate ratio (Fig. 4B). The Ca2+-mediated DNA cleavage is confined to the canonical site irrespective of plasmid or oligonucleotide substrates. DNA-binding enzymes involved in phosphoryl transfer reactions generally require divalent metal ions to promote their activity. In most cases Mg2+ is used as a cofactor. The preference for Mg2+ over other metal ions is probably due to its favorable physical and chemical properties, such as a small ionic radius with extensive hydration, high charge density, high transport numbers, and its abundance in the cell (27Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA cleavage, Mg2+ is also required for specific binding of several type II REases to their recognition sequences. Divalent metal ion Ca2+ can substitute Mg2+ for DNA binding (9Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The comparative DNA binding studies revealed that EcoRV exhibits a greater degree of specificity in the presence of Ca2+ for the canonical site (28Martin A.M. Horton N.C. Lusetti S. Reich N.O. Perona J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8430-8439Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Binding of several other REases to their recognition sites is enhanced in the presence of Ca2+ (8Lagunavicius A. Grazulis S. Balciunaite E. Vainius D. Siksnys V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11093-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 11Skirgaila R. Siksnys V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1998; 379: 595-598PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, substitution of Ca2+ to Mg2+ in DNA binding studies indicates that these two metal ions occupy the same DNA-binding pocket. Tertiary structures of several REases reveal that Ca2+ indeed occupies the same position as that of Mg2+ in the active site (10Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Horton J.R. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Newman M. Lunnen K. Wilson G.

Sam M.D. Reich N.O. Perona J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). KpnI REase binds to cognate DNA sequence in the absence of metal ion cofactor (19Chandrashekaran S. Babu P. Nagaraja V. J. Biosci. (Bangalore). 1999; 24: 269-277Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The exquisite cleavage specificity in the presence of Ca2+ and suppression of Mg2+/Mn2+-mediated promiscuous activity by Ca2+ are unique characteristics of KpnI REase. This suppression could probably be due to conformational changes at the active site of the protein leading to the formation of inactive or unstable complex at the noncanonical site ceasing DNA cleavage in the presence of Ca2+. The metal ion competition experiments of EcoRI and EcoRV showed that the Mg2+-dependent endonuclease activity was inhibited in the presence of Ca2+. However, in a Mn2+-dependent reaction, EcoRV showed enhanced activity by Ca2+ (9Vipond I.B. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1113-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In these two well studied enzymes, Ca2+ by itself does not induce DNA cleavage. The ionic radius of Ca2+ is larger compared with Mg2+ and Mn2+ which favors different coordination geometry. The bulk effect and different coordination chemistry of Ca2+ may cause steric interference and destabilize the bound oxygens that could perturb the transition state rather than the initial binding to the active site. The change in solvation at the interface of the enzyme-DNA complex is also known to play an important role in site-specific recognition. Influence of bound water molecules on site-specific recognition and cleavage of DNA was studied for several REases (31Robinson C.R. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2186-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32Robinson C.R. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3444-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the case of Mg2+-mediated phosphodiester hydrolysis, an outer-sphere pathway that requires a solvated metal cofactor is favored as Mg2+ maintains a moderate to high hydration state. According to this mechanism the metal cofactor is involved in stabilizing the transition state, either electrostatically and/or through hydrogen bonding from the metal-bound water molecules. The solvation state of the metal cofactor is of critical importance in site-specific DNA recognition by these enzymes. Ca2+-bound KpnI REase with fewer bound water molecules at the active site could be responsible for higher specificity in DNA recognition and cleavage than the Mg2+/Mn2+-bound enzyme. The Ca2+-dependent cleavage specificity of KpnI REase could probably be due to the involvement of additional residues neighboring or distal to the active site influencing the stabilization of the KpnI-Ca2+-DNA transition state. Delineation of the KpnI active site architecture may open up the possibilities to engineer other type II REases for specific cleavage, resulting in high fidelity REases devoid of any promiscuous activity. The ability of REases to recognize a wide range of sequences having one or two nucleotide changes in the recognition sequence is of evolutionary significance. The R-M systems appear to have evolved from two totally unrelated genes such as a nonspecific nuclease and a possible repair protein, which acquired an MTase activity (33Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. Virus Genes. 2001; 22: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). While evolving to recognize the specific sequence, some of the REases would have been evolutionarily stuck at an earlier step to retain broader cleavage specificity. KpnI REase seems to represent one such system. Under most physiological conditions, the enzyme is unlikely to express the promiscuous behavior as it exhibits remarkable specificity in the presence of Ca2+. However, the promiscuity of the enzyme could be advantageous to the bacteria if allowed to be expressed under certain circumstances especially when encountering the invasion by foreign genomes.

https://openalex.org/W2119945866,"In response to brief synaptic stimulation that activates protein kinase A (PKA), the bag cell neurons of Aplysia trigger the onset of reproductive behaviors by generating a prolonged afterdischarge. In juvenile animals, such afterdischarges are inhibited by a high density of Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels, encoded by the slo gene. An increase in this current also follows an afterdischarge in mature animals, contributing to a subsequent refractory state that limits reproductive behaviors. Using a bag cell cDNA library, we have isolated two alternative transcripts of the slo gene, differing in the presence (slo-a) or absence (slo-b) of a consensus phosphorylation site for PKA. Expression of either isoform in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced Ca2+- and voltage-dependent channels with macroscopic and unitary properties matching those in bag cell neurons. The isoforms differed, however, in their response to application of the catalytic subunit of PKA, which reduced the open probability of Slo-a, an effect that was reversed by a PKA inhibitor. In contrast, PKA had no effect on Slo-b. By immunocytochemistry, we determined that the PKA-regulated Slo-a subunit is present in adult, but not juvenile, bag cell neurons. Patch clamp recordings from adult and juvenile bag cell neurons confirmed that PKA decreases BK channel activity only in adults. Our findings suggest that a change in the identity of Slo isoforms expressed during development allows mature neurons to generate afterdischarges that are required for reproduction.

Our findings suggest that a change in the identity of Slo isoforms expressed during development allows mature neurons to generate afterdischarges that are required for reproduction. During development of the nervous system, the pathways that underlie reproductive behaviors are the last to mature (1Kandel E.R. Behavioral Biology of Aplysia: a Contribution to the Comparative Study of Opisthobranch Molluscs. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1979Google Scholar, 2Wallen K. Baum M. Pfaff D.W. Arnold A.P. Hormones, Brain, and Behavior. 4. Academic Press, New York2002: 385-423Google Scholar). In adult Aplysia, a series of reproductive behaviors is controlled by the bag cell neurons within the abdominal ganglion. Brief stimulation of the bag cell neurons triggers a period of repetitive firing termed an afterdischarge (3Kupfermann I. Kandel E.R. J. Neurophysiol. 1970; 33: 865-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Conn P.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 237-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Secretion of neuropeptides during the afterdischarge initiates a sequence of reproductive behaviors culminating in egg laying behavior. Although juvenile animals synthesize the same neuropeptides as adults and can be induced to secrete them by pharmacological manipulations, electrical stimulation of the neurons in juvenile animals fails to trigger the normal afterdischarge characteristic of adults (5Nick T.A.

PKA suppresses several species of K+ currents, which enhances excitability and increases action potential broadening (8Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F. Nairn A.C. Walter U. Wilson F.D. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7487-7491Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 9Kaczmarek L.K. Strumwasser F. J. Neurophysiol. 1984; 52: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Activation of PKA also indirectly shifts the gating mode of non-selective cation channels through the activation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase, such that a long lasting closed state of the channel is eliminated, resulting in the sustained depolarization underlying the afterdischarge (10Wilson G.F. Kaczmarek L.K. Nature. 1993; 366: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Magoski N.S. Knox R.J. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 522: 271-283Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Previous electrophysiological work has shown that the density of a Ca2+- and voltage-dependent K+ current in juvenile neurons is 3-fold greater than that in adults (12Nick T.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Carew T.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7583-7598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that it falls during maturation. The properties of this current in the bag cell neurons have been shown to match those of the large conductance BK channels that are encoded by the slo gene (13Zhang Y. Magoski N.S. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10134-10141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have now isolated two isoforms of the slo gene, encoding BK Ca2+-activated K+ channels, from the bag cell neurons. The channel encoded by one of the isoforms is inhibited by PKA, whereas the other is unaffected by this kinase. The PKA-sensitive isoform appears in development during the transition from juvenile to mature neurons. The selective presence of this isoform in adults may allow PKA to decrease current in response to stimulation and permit afterdischarges to occur. Cloning—Aplysia Slo cDNAs were first isolated from a whole central nervous system λ Zap II cDNA library that was screened at low stringency using DNA probes corresponding to the amino and carboxyl cytoplasmic coding regions of the Drosophila Slo channel. Five independent clones were isolated. Two of these, F7 and F11, encoded the fifth transmembrane domain of Slo up to the stop codon and appear to represent alternatively spliced cDNAs. When compared with F11, F7 lacks two exons in the region encoding the carboxyl terminus and has an alternative 3′-end coding region. Another clone, F6, encodes the 5′-end of the mRNA and has partial overlap with F7 and F11. F7 and F11 full-length cDNAs were constructed by joining F6 to either F7 or F11 at a common restriction site. To isolate Slo isoforms that are expressed in the bag cell neurons, we designed eight pairs of PCR primers, four forward and four reverse, based on the F7 and F11 sequences expressed in the total central nervous system. These were used for PCR or nested PCR on a bag cell neuron λ Zap II cDNA library. PCR products were purified and cloned into the T/A cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The products were directly sequenced by the HHMI Biopolymer-Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Both coding and untranslated regions were identified for two distinct Slo isoforms. New PCR primers based on the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions were then used for nested PCR to obtain full-length Slo-a and Slo-b fragments, which were subcloned into the pCDNA3 vector and sequenced in their entirety. Slo-a is identical to the AsloF11 cDNA isolated from the whole central nervous system. Electrophysiological Recordings—CHO cells were cultured in Iscoves modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Before transient transfection of CHO cells with Aplysia Slo cDNA, cells were grown to ∼60–70% confluence on 35-mm dishes or coverslips. Cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with 1 μgof Aplysia Slo cDNA. Recordings were made from fluorescent cells 1–2 days later. Electrodes had a resistance of 3–5 MΩ for whole cell recordings and 5–10 MΩ for single channel recordings. For whole cell recordings, the bath solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 29 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The pipette (intracellular) solution contained 32.5 mm KCl, 97.5 mm K+ gluconate, 5 mm EGTA, 4.27 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). For single channel patch recordings, pipettes were filled with an extracellular solution and the cytoplasmic side of the membrane was perfused with intracellular solution buffered to 1, 10, or 100 μm free Ca2+ (as determined by the computer program CaBuffer, courtesy of Dr. L. Schlichter, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada). Data were acquired with an EPC-8 amplifier (HEKA Electronics, Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada), a Digidata 1200 analog-to-digital converter (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), and the clampex acquisition program of pClamp (version 6.02; Axon Instruments). Current was sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz with a Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MS). Data were gathered in 1–3 min intervals while holding the patch at +30 mV. Single BK channel current in bag cell neurons was measured as for CHO cells using the excised, inside-out patch clamp method. Pipettes had resistances of 5–10 MΩ when filled with normal artificial sea water; see below for composition but lacking glucose, penicillin, and streptomycin). After excision, the cytoplasmic face was bathed with artificial intracellular saline composed of (in mm): 470.4 KCl, 66 MgCl2, 15 HEPES, 5 EGTA, pH 7.3, with a calculated free [Ca2+] of ∼1 μm. The catalytic subunit of PKA and the peptide inhibitor PKA6–22 were obtained from Calbiochem. For single channel analysis, pClamp 9.0 (Axon Instruments) was used. Data are presented as the mean and S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using Instat (version 2.01; Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Student's t test was used to test for differences between two means. Data were considered significantly different at p < 0.05. Dose-response curves for Ca2+ were fit with the equation: I = Imin + (Imax–Imin)/(1 + 10 ^ (log EC50-C)*n, where I is the measured channel open probability (NPo), Imin is the minimal channel open probability, Imax is the peak channel open probability, C is the concentration of agonist used, C50 is the concentration of agonist required to achieve half-maximal activation (i.e. EC50), and n is the degree of cooperativity. Animals and Bag Cell Neuron Culture—Adult Aplysia Californica weighing 100–200 g were obtained from Marinus Inc. (Long Beach, CA). Juvenile Aplysia weighing between 5–10 g were obtained from the Aplysia Resource Facility (University of Miami). Primary cultures of isolated bag cell neurons were prepared as described previously (13Zhang Y. Magoski N.S. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10134-10141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and maintained in normal artificial sea water (in mm: 460 NaCl, 10.4 KCl, 11 CaCl2, 55 MgCl2, 15 HEPES, 1 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.8) for 1–3 days in a 14 °C incubator. Antibody Production and Purification—Two peptides were synthesized to generate antibodies against the amino acid sequences encoded by the cloned Slo-a and Slo-b cDNAs. Peptide 1 (CXRFRDTNESVRSPSSKR) included the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of both identified bag cell Slo isoforms. Peptide 2 (CXPEKRKPQSRRKPSTTLK) was selective for the Slo-a isoform and coincided with the consensus PKA phosphorylation site. Both were synthesized at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center, Yale University. The X in each sequence represents aminocaproic acid, which acted as a spacer molecule between the specific sequence and a nonspecific amino-terminal cysteine, which allowed conjugation of peptides to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) peptide. KLH, in turn, acted as a carrier for antigenic peptide in the generation of chicken polyclonal IgY, which was carried out by Aves Labs, Inc. (Tigard, OR). For affinity purification of IgYs, the synthetic peptides were conjugated to Sulfolink coupling gel (Pierce) by the amino-terminal cysteine. Each of the two prepared columns was incubated with IgYs for 1 h at room temperature, and then the columns were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Specific antibodies were eluted with 100 mm glycine buffer, pH 2.5, and then immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.5. Fractions containing proteins (measured by the optical density at 280 nm) were pooled and dialyzed against PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce) and concentrated using a spin column. Immunocytochemistry—Staining of 1–2-day-cultured bag cell neurons was performed on coverslips coated with 1 μg/ml poly(d)lysine. Fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in 400 mm sucrose/artificial sea water and preparation were carried out as described by (14Azhderian E.M. Hefner D. Lin C.H. Kaczmarek L.K. Forscher P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1223-1233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Coverslips were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 5% goat serum/PBS before incubation with primary antibodies. They were inverted on 100 μl of primary antibody solution (0.75 μg/ml (Slo-a) or 0.5 μg/ml (Slo-b) in 5% goat serum/PBS) and placed in a humidified chamber at 4 °C overnight, washed extensively with PBS, and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with either fluorescein- or Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG secondary antibodies (Texas Red-GαCIgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-GαCIgG). CHO cells transiently transfected with Aplysia Slo were grown on glass coverslips to ∼60–70% confluence and fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. This buffer was used for all subsequent incubations. Primary affinity-purified anti-Aplysia Slo was added to the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-GαCIgG (1/1,000; Molecular Probes) for 30 min, washed again, and mounted on glass slides with Citifluor mounting medium (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) for fluorescence microscopy. Cloning of Slo Isoforms in Bag Cell Neurons—Using a bag cell neuron cDNA library as described under “Materials and Methods,” we isolated two full-length cDNAs encoding Slo channels with open reading frames encoding proteins of 1070 and 1060 amino acids (Fig. 1A). We termed these isoforms Slo-a and Slo-b, respectively. Both isoforms have characteristics of Slo channels in other species, including seven transmembrane domains (S0-S6), RCK domains, and long cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domains (15Jiang Y. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 16Shi J. Krishnamoorthy G. Yang Y. Hu L. Chaturvedi N. Harilal D.

Zeng X. Lingle C.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the Aplysia Slo channels are 56 and 62% identical to hSlo and dSlo, the human and Drosophila orthologs. The sequences of both Slo-a and Slo-b contain multiple consensus sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C. In contrast, there are no consensus sites for PKA on Slo-b, whereas Slo-a has a single consensus PKA site that is located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the 10-amino acid insert that is unique to this isoform (Fig. 1B). The Aplysia Slo-a sequence has been submitted to GenBank™ with the accession number AY359443. Properties of Slo-a and Slo-b Channels in Transfected Cells—To examine the properties of the Aplysia Slo channels, we expressed both isoforms in CHO cells and carried out whole cell voltage clamp recordings on the second day after transfection. When intracellular Ca2+ was set at 1 μm, currents that activated at potentials >0 mV and did not inactivate over several hundred milliseconds were detected (Fig. 2A). No currents were found in CHO cells transfected with vector alone. The mean current-voltage (I-V) relationships for Slo-a-transfected CHO cells is shown in Fig. 2B. The kinetics and I-V relation of Slo-b expressed in CHO cells were similar to those of Slo-a (data not shown). We also examined the unitary properties of the Aplysia Slo channels in excised inside-out patches with symmetrical K+ (Fig. 2C). The amplitudes of unitary currents were determined from Gaussian fits of amplitude histograms at different voltages and were used to construct a single channel I-V relationship for Slo-a (Fig. 2D). The slope of the I-V relationship gave a single channel conductance of 117 ± 16 pS (range 101–133 pS, n = 5). We also determined the unitary conductance for the Slo-b isoform, which was 114 ± 15 pS, (range 99–129 pS, n = 5). The conductances were not statistically different (unpaired Student's t test, p > 0.05), indicating that the splice insert in Slo-a does not affect unitary conductance. To measure the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Aplysia Slo channels, we carried out excised inside-out patch clamp recordings from Slo-a- and Slo-b-transfected CHO cells using different Ca2+ concentrations at the cytoplasmic face of the patch. As expected for BK channels, raising the intracellular Ca2+ concentration from 1 μm up to 100 μm resulted in a pronounced increase in the open probability of these channels (Fig. 2, E and F). There was no significant difference between the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Slo-a and Slo-b isoforms (data not shown). Modulation of Slo Isoforms by PKA in CHO Cells—Channels encoded by the Slo-a and Slo-b isoforms differed in their response to the catalytic subunit of PKA. When the cytoplasmic face of inside-out patches from CHO cells expressing Slo-b was exposed to the PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of 1 mm Mg-ATP and 1 μm free Ca2+, no significant effect on open probability was observed (Fig. 3, B and E). In contrast, application of the catalytic subunit to patches from Slo-a-expressing CHO cells under the same conditions produced a significant reduction in open probability (Fig. 3, A and E). In patches containing only one channel, the mean open time under control conditions at +30 mV was 2.5 ± 0.4 ms and was unaltered by treatment with the PKA catalytic subunit (2.3 ± 0.5, n = 5, p > 0.05), but the mean closed time changed significantly from 4.4 ± 0.2 ms to 6.7 ± 0.5 ms (n = 5, p < 0.001). By grouping true single channel recordings with those containing more than one channel, we found that the mean reduction of NPo (number of channels multiplied by probability of opening) by the PKA catalytic subunit was 31 ± 2%, (n = 10, p < 0.001). The effect of the catalytic subunit could be blocked fully by co-application of PKA6–22, a specific peptide antagonist of PKA (55Glass D.B. Lundquist L.J. Katz B.M. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14579-14584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, C and E). We also tested the effect of PKA on cells transfected with both Slo-a and Slo-b. When the cytoplasmic face of insideout patches from CHO cells expressing Slo-a and Slo-b was exposed to the PKA catalytic subunit in the presence of 1 mm Mg-ATP and 1 μm free Ca2+, the NPo was reduced by 30 ± 2.4% (n = 5, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3, D and E), a degree of suppression similar to that observed for Slo-a alone. This suggests that, if heteromers of Slo-a and Slo-b form in such transfected cells, the heteromers remain sensitive to PKA. Effect of PKA on BK Channels in Adult and Juvenile Bag Cell Neurons—To compare the properties of Aplysia Slo channel isoforms expressed in CHO cells with BK channels in native bag cell neurons of adult and juvenile animals, we carried out single channel recordings on isolated cultured bag cell neurons. Inside-out patch clamp recordings from these neurons, using symmetrical K+ solutions, typically exhibited little channel activity at +30 mV in a Ca2+-free medium at the cytoplasmic face. When the Ca2+ concentration at the cytoplasmic face of the patch was raised to 1 μm, channel activity increased markedly and reverted to control upon return of the patch to a Ca2+-free medium (Fig. 4A). Further raising the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration from 1 μm to 100 μm resulted in a further increase in open probability of the channels (Fig. 4F). The unitary conductance of endogenous BK channels was 98 + 10 pS (range 88–108 pS, n = 5, Fig. 4B), which is consistent with that of Aplysia Slo in CHO cells (see Fig. 2D). To examine PKA-dependent regulation of native BK channels, the catalytic subunit of PKA was applied to the cytoplasmic face of inside-out patches that contained BK channels excised from adult bag cell neurons. In all cases (n = 5), application of the catalytic subunit in the presence of 1 mm ATP (MgATP) produced a significant reduction in NPo (Fig. 4, C and E). The calcium dependence of channel opening was also examined after application of the PKA catalytic subunit. The normalized Ca2+ dependence of channel opening was not different from that prior to application of the catalytic subunit (Fig. 4F). In contrast to adults, application of the PKA catalytic subunit to patches excised from bag cell neurons prepared from juvenile bag cell neurons failed to produce any change in open probability (Fig. 4, D and E). Expression of the Two Splice Variants Is Differentially Regulated during Bag Cell Neuron Development—To examine the localization and development of Slo subunits in bag cell neurons, two antibodies against the Aplysia Slo isoforms were raised in chickens. The first (α-Slo-ab) was generated against 15 amino acids that are conserved in the carboxyl-terminal region of both Slo-a and Slo-b (Fig. 1). The second (α-Slo-a) was generated against a 15-amino acid peptide corresponding to the insert that is specific to the Slo-a isoform and contains the single consensus site for phosphorylation by PKA. Characterization of the antibodies was performed using immunofluorescence. CHO cells transfected with either the Slo-a or Slo-b isoforms were strongly labeled with the α-Slo-ab antibody directed against the conserved region (Fig. 5, A and C). In contrast, the α-Slo-a antibody selectively stained Slo-a, but not Slo-b-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5, B and D). No staining was detected with preimmune serum, and staining with each antibody was eliminated by preabsorption with its corresponding immunogen peptide (data not shown). To examine the localization of the Slo isoforms in bag cell neurons, we prepared isolated bag cell neurons from adult and juvenile animals. Using either the α-Slo-ab or the α-Slo-a antibodies, intense staining was detected in the membranes of the somata and in the growth cones of adult neurons (Fig. 5, E and F). The staining pattern with both antibodies appeared very similar, and we could find no significant differences in apparent localization of channels. This indicates that the Slo-a isoform, which contains the PKA consensus phosphorylation site, is expressed in adult bag cell neurons. In contrast to adults, juvenile neurons were stained only very faintly with the α-Slo-a antibody (Fig. 5H), whereas robust staining was obtained using α-Slo-ab directed against the carboxyl-terminal region conserved in both isoforms (Fig. 5G). These findings indicate that the Slo-a isoform is expressed in bag cell neurons only late in development. Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) are ubiquitous in neurons (19Latorre R. Oberhauser A. Labarca P. Alvarez O. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) and play a critical role in regulating neuronal firing patterns and neurotransmitter release (20Gho M. Ganetzky B. J. Exp.

Although there is only one gene, slo, that encodes these channels, diversity in the properties of BK channels is generated by the association of the Slo subunit with ancillary proteins (21Robitaille R.

RNA splicing at several different sites can give rise to multiple distinct ion channels from the slo gene (26Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 27Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D. Krause J.D. Mertz R. Godinot N. DiChiara T.J. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1315-1330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Some of the splice variants differ from each other in their biophysical properties (27Tseng-Crank J. Foster C.D.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20347-20351Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby allowing fine-tuning of BK currents to the needs of a particular cell. For example, alternative splicing seems to play a particularly critical role in the tonotopic organization of the cochlea (29Jones E.M.C. Gray-Keller M. Fettiplace R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 518: 653-665Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Ramanathan K. Michael T.H. Jiang G.-J. Hiel H. Fuchs P.A. Science. 1999; 283: 215-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have isolated the slo gene from the bag cell neurons of Aplysia and determined that two specific splice isoforms, Slo-a and Slo-b, are found in these cells. They differ only in the presence or absence of a unique consensus phosphorylation site for PKA, located in the large carboxyl tail domain that plays a role in Ca2+ sensing and acts as a partner for protein-protein interactions (31Schreiber M.

Previous work has shown that Slo channels in other species are modulated by a number of different protein kinases (35Chung S.K. Reinhart P.H. Martin B.L. Brautigan D. Levitan I.B.

Physiol. 1994; 56: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and the nature of this modulation can differ between tissues. For example, PKA activates BK channels in smooth muscle as well as in neurons but inhibits channel activity in endocrine cells of the anterior pituitary (43Lee K. Rowe I.C. Ashford M.L. J. Physiol. 1995; 488 (Pt. 2): 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 44Perez G. Toro L. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1459-C1463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Shipston M.J. Kelly J.S.

Physiol. 2000; 524 (Pt. 2): 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Regulation of the channels can occur either by phosphorylation of the ion channel protein itself or by influencing regulatory components intimately associated with channel subunits (40Reinhart P. Chung S. Martin B. Brautigan D. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ewald D.A. Williams A. Levitan I.B. Nature. 1985; 315: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some cases, BK channel modulation occurs through dephosphorylation by phosphoprotein phosphatases (37Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Physiol. 1996; 493 (Pt. 3): 665-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41White R.E. Schonbrunn A. Armstrong D.L.

The afterdischarge of adult bag cell neurons is evoked by brief stimulation of an afferent input from the head ganglia and endures for ∼30 min. Onset of the afterdischarge is associated with the activation of both PKA and protein kinase C (4Conn P.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 237-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 50Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K.R. Strumwasser F. Brain Res. 1982; 238: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP levels increase rapidly during the first few minutes of afterdischarge and thereafter decline to control values (6Kaczmarek L.K. Jennings K. Strumwasser F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5200-5204Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In isolated cells, elevations of cyclic AMP or direct injection of the catalytic subunit of PKA produces broadening of action potentials that mimics the action potential broadening that occurs during the first 2 min of the afterdischarge. This spike broadening is associated with a decrease in the amplitude of K+ currents (4Conn P.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Mol. Neurobiol. 1989; 3: 237-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 51Loechner K.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Brain Res. 1990; 532: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Our findings that the PKA-sensitive Slo-a isoform is expressed in adult bag cell neurons and that BK channel activity in adult neurons is attenuated by PKA suggest that decreases in BK current may contribute to the early increase in excitability and/or spike broadening that occurs in the first few minutes of the afterdischarge. The Slo-a isoform appears to be absent, or expressed at very low levels, in bag cell neurons of juvenile animals. Although neurons from juvenile animals synthesize the neuroactive peptides that trigger reproductive behaviors and can be induced to release these peptides by pharmacological manipulations (12Nick T.A. Kaczmarek L.K. Carew T.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7583-7598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their electrical properties differ from those of adults. In particular, although juvenile neurons fire normal action potentials, repetitive stimulation of these neurons fails to increase their excitability and trigger the afterdischarge that normally evokes neuropeptide release (5Nick T.A. Moreira J.E. Kaczmarek L.K. Carew T.J. Wayne N.L. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 76: 3351-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The inhibition of the Slo-a isoform in adult neurons by elevated cyclic AMP and PKA will promote the increased excitability necessary for afterdischarge generation. Furthermore, the absence of Slo-a from juvenile neurons is consistent with this difference in excitability between the two neuronal types. Although the mechanism for the change in expression of slo splice variants during development is not known, it has been shown in Drosophila that there are four promoter regions for the slo gene and their recruitment appears to be tissue- and development stage-specific (52Brenner R. Atkinson N. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 536-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 53Brenner R. Thomas T. Becker M. Atkinson N. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1827-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in promoter activity may therefore also be coupled to alterations in the pattern of splicing of Slo channel RNA, both during development and in response to external stimuli, providing a general mechanism for modulation of cellular excitability (54Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond M.S.L. Coghill L.S. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol.

In the present study, we report a systematic analysis of the effect of metal ion binding on the structural stability of the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase. Chemical and thermal denaturation assays revealed that the stability of the protein is increased significantly in the presence of metal ions. Structural analyses clearly established that metal ion binding increases hydrophobic exposure on the RNA polymerase surface. Furthermore, our denaturation studies, coupled with polymerization assays, demonstrate that the active site region of the polymerase is more sensitive to chemical denaturant than other structural scaffolds. We also report the first detailed study of the thermodynamic parameters involved in the interaction between the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase and metal ions. Finally, a mutational analysis was also performed to investigate the importance of Asp220, Asp318, and Asp319 for metal ion binding. This mutational study underscores a strict requirement for each of the residues for metal binding, indicating that the active center of the HCV RNA polymerase is intolerant to virtually any perturbations of the metal coordination sphere, thereby highlighting the critical role of the enzyme-bound metal ions. Overall, our results indicate that metal ions play a dual modulatory role in the RNA polymerase reaction by promoting both a favorable geometry of the active site for catalysis and by increasing the structural stability of the enzyme.

It is estimated that about 80% of patients with acute HCV infection will progress to chronic hepatitis. Of these, 20% will develop cirrhosis, and 1–5% will develop hepatocellular carcinoma (2Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M.

This lack of specificity for HCV RNA supports the notion that additional viral or cellular factors are required for specific recognition of the viral replication signal. The HCV RNA polymerase activity has been shown to be supported by both magnesium and manganese ions (7Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R.

However, the recent characterization of the affinity of the enzyme for metal ions suggests that magnesium is the cation that is used in vivo during polymerization (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Analysis of the crystal structure of NS5B revealed that the protein is folded into characteristic fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains (28Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Roussel A. Incitti I. Vitale R.L.

Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The particular fold adopted by the palm subdomain is shared by many proteins that bind nucleotides and/or nucleic acids (30Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the HCV RNA polymerase showed that it contains two absolutely conserved aspartic acid residues that coordinate two metal ions in the active site of the protein (31Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These two metal ions are in contact with both the phosphate of the nucleotide and several acidic amino acids residues (31Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). A catalytic mechanism has been proposed for polymerases in which one metal ion is involved in both positioning the substrate and in the activation of an incoming nucleophile (32Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Nucleophilic attack would then generate a trigonal bipyramidal transition state that would be stabilized by both metal ions. The second metal ion also stabilizes the negative charge that appears on the leaving 3′-oxygen, thus facilitating its departure from the phosphate. Analysis of the NS5B protein crystal structure indicated that the two metal ions are about 3.6 Å apart in the active site of the protein (31Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Crystallographic and fluorescence spectroscopy data indicate that metal ion binding seems to be limited to the active site region and does not involve other subdomains of the protein (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Finally, we and others recently demonstrated that the enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon binding of metal ions (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 33Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Kim Y.C. Gutshall L. Silverman C. Khandekar S. Sarisky R.T. Kao C.C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, this process does not significantly stimulate the binding of the enzyme to the RNA or NTP substrates (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report a systematic analysis of the effect of metal ion binding on the structural stability of the HCV RNA polymerase. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and denaturation assays, we demonstrate that the binding of metal ions to the enzyme is critical for both structural stabilization and catalysis. Mutational analysis also revealed the importance of specific aspartate residues for metal binding. Our data provide insights on the precise role of metal ions in the NS5B-mediated RNA polymerase reaction. HCV NS5B Expression and Purification—The expression and purification of a truncated form of HCV NS5B protein (NS5BΔ21) lacking the last 21 amino acids of the protein were performed as described previously (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alanine substitutions were introduced into the NS5B gene by using the two-stage overlap extension method (34Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence was measured using a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Background emission was eliminated by subtracting the signal from either buffer alone or buffer containing the appropriate quantity of substrate. The extent to which ligands bind to the NS5B protein was determined by monitoring the fluorescence emission of a fixed concentration of proteins and titrating with a given ligand. The binding can be described by Equation 1,Kd=[NS5B][ligand][NS5B·ligand](Eq.1) where Kd is the apparent dissociation constant, [NS5B] is the concentration of the protein, [NS5B·ligand] is the concentration of complexed protein, and [ligand] is the concentration of unbound ligand. The proportion of ligand-bound protein as described by Equation 1 is related to measured fluorescence emission intensity by Equation 2,ΔF/ΔFmax=[NS5B·ligand]/[NS5B]tot(Eq.2) where ΔF is the magnitude of the difference between the observed fluorescence intensity at a given concentration of ligand and the fluorescence intensity in the absence of ligand, ΔFmax is the difference at infinite [ligand], and [NS5B]tot is the total protein concentration. If the total ligand concentration, [ligand]tot, is in large molar excess relative to [NS5B]tot, then it can be assumed that [ligand] is approximately equal to [ligand]tot. Equations 1 and 2 can then be combined to give Equation 3.ΔF/ΔFmax=[ligand]tot/(Kd+[ligand]tot)(Eq.3) The Kd values were determined from a nonlinear least squares regression analysis of titration data using Equation 3. Thermodynamics of Binding—The temperature dependence of the association constants (Ka) for ligand binding was analyzed according to the van't Hoff isobaric equation, assuming that the entropy change (ΔSo) and the enthalpy change (ΔHo) remained constant over the whole range of temperatures (Equation 4).ln Ka=ΔSoR−ΔHoRT(Eq.4) Equilibrium Unfolding Experiments—A 100 nm solution of NS5B was adjusted to the desired final concentration of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) and incubated for 60 min at 22 °C. The parameters ΔG°u (free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant), m (cooperativity of unfolding), and Cm (midpoint concentration of denaturant required to unfold half of the protein) were obtained as previously outlined using Equation 5ΔGu=−RT ln Ku(Eq.5) and Equation 6.ΔGu=ΔGuo−m[GdmHCl](Eq.6) In Vitro Enzymatic Assay—The incorporation of [α-32P]UTP was measured as described previously (7Behrens S.E. Tomei L. De Francesco R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 12-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). The standard reaction (50 μl) was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm MgCl2, 10 units of RNAguard (Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm NaCl, with 0.2 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, 10 μg/ml poly(A)/(oligo)dT, and 1 mm cold UTP. The reactions were incubated at 18 °C for 2 h followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The precipitable radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. CD Spectroscopy Measurements—CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The samples were analyzed in quartz cells with path lengths of 1 mm. Thermal transitions were monitored by following the change in ellipticity at 222 nm. The samples were heated from 20 to 95 °C, at a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The ellipticity results were expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [θ], in degrees·cm2·dmol–1. The fraction of unfolded protein at each temperature was determined by calculating the ratio [θ222]/[θ222]d, where [θ222]d is the molar ellipticity for the completely unfolded enzyme. ANS Binding Measurements—Binding of ANS (1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate) was evaluated by measuring the fluorescence enhancement of ANS (50 μm) upon excitation at a wavelength of 380 nm. The emission spectra were integrated from 400 to 600 nm. Quenching of HCV RNA Polymerase by Acrylamide—Quenching experiments were performed at 22 °C by adding increasing concentrations of acrylamide. The excitation wavelength was set at 290 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were scanned from 300 to 400 nm. The integration area between 330 and 360 nm was used for data analysis. The fluorescence quenching data in the presence of acrylamide were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation (35Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar),Fo/F=1+Ksv[Q] where Fo and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of the quencher, respectively. Ksv is the dynamic Stern-Volmer quenching constant, and [Q] is the quencher concentration. When the Stern-Volmer displayed an upward curvature, the static quenching concept was used, and the experimental data were fitted to a revised Stern-Volmer equation,Fo/F=1+Ksv[Q]exp(V)[Q]) where V is the static quenching constant measuring the complex formation between acrylamide and the enzyme. Expression, Purification, and Intrinsic Fluorescence Properties of the HCV RNA Polymerase—To evaluate the role of metal ions in the NS5B-mediated RNA polymerase activity, the enzyme was expressed as described previously (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the 65-kDa NS5B protein was the predominant polypeptide in the purified fraction (Fig. 1A). The identity of the protein was also confirmed by immunoblotting analysis, using a monospecific antibody (data not shown). The fluorescence properties of the purified NS5B protein in standard buffer at 22 °C are shown in Fig. 1B. Analysis of the background corrected fluorescence emission spectrum of the NS5B protein revealed an emission maximum (λmax = 335 nm) that is blue shifted relative to that of free l-tryptophan, which under the same conditions is observed to be at 350 nm. Blue shifts of protein emission spectra have been ascribed to shielding of the tryptophan residues from the aqueous phase, a result of the three-dimensional structure of the protein. Accordingly, denaturation of NS5B with 8 m urea results in a red shift of λmax toward 350 nm (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the molar intensity of the fluorescence emission spectrum of NS5B revealed a linear change of 0.16 fluorescence intensity units/nm protein concentration (Fig. 1B). This relatively small change can probably be attributed to small losses of proteins from solution through adhesion. All subsequent binding experiments were therefore performed at a protein concentration of 100 nm, with the assumption that the binding equilibrium was not complicated by the presence of an aggregation equilibrium. Denaturation Studies—In a recent study, we demonstrated that the HCV RNA polymerase undergoes subtle conformational changes upon the binding of metal ions, but this process does not significantly stimulate the binding of RNA or NTP substrates (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because metal ions have the potential to play both catalytic and structural roles in protein chemistry, we analyzed the effect of magnesium ions on the structural stability of the HCV RNA polymerase. The effect of metal ion binding on the NS5B structural stability was initially assessed by GdmHCl denaturation assays performed at 22 °C. Upon an increase of the GdmHCl concentration, the fluorescence emission maximum of the unliganded NS5B protein shifted to 350 nm (data not shown), reflecting the transfer of tryptophan residues to a more polar environment. The unliganded protein structure reacted very sensitively to the slightest concentration changes in the lower concentration range between 0.5 and 3.0 m where the strongest effects on emission changes are observed (Fig. 2A). No changes could be observed at GdmHCl concentrations higher than 3.5 m. The Cm value (midpoint concentration of denaturant required to unfold half of the protein) was reached at 1.05 m GdmHCl. Protein denaturation assays were then performed in the presence of saturating concentrations of Mg2+ ions. The complete thermodynamic unfolding parameters were determined, and the values are presented in Table I. A significant stabilization of the NS5B structure was observed in the presence of magnesium ions, as reflected by the shift in the Cm value that was now reached at 1.91 m GdmHCl (Fig. 2A). The informative finding is that the stability of the enzyme is increased by 2.22 kJ·mol–1 in the presence of Mg2+ ions.Table IThermodynamic unfolding parameters measured by equilibrium GdmHCl denaturationProteinCmΔCmmΔGDuoΔΔGDuommkJ·mol-1m-1kJ·mol-1kJ·mol-1NS5B1.050.002.845.590.00NS5B·Mg1.910.863.257.812.22 Open table in a new tab The chemical denaturation assays were also analyzed in terms of catalytic activity. Two distinct approaches were undertaken to study the effect of denaturation on the catalytic activity of the protein. In the first approach, the HCV RNA polymerase was initially denatured with increasing concentrations of GdmHCl. The RNA polymerase activity of the protein was then monitored by incubating the denatured protein with magnesium and a proper combination of template/primer/nucleotide. The data indicated that the RNA polymerase activity of the enzyme was reduced by 50% at a concentration of 0.81 m GdmHCl (Fig. 2B). In the second approach, the NS5B protein was initially incubated with magnesium. The protein-ion complex was then denatured with GdmHCl and subsequently assayed for RNA polymerase activity. Using this second approach, a concentration of 1.32 m GdmHCl was necessary to reduce the NS5B-mediated RNA polymerase activity by half (Fig. 2B). Overall these data indicate that the binding of metal ions to the HCV RNA polymerase protects the enzyme against chemical denaturation. By comparison with the structural stability assay (Fig. 2A), these data suggest that the active site region of the enzyme is more sensitive to chemical denaturant than other structural scaffolds. The effects of metal binding on the structural stability of the HCV RNA polymerase were also assessed by CD spectroscopy. Thermal denaturation assays were performed in both the presence and absence of Mg2+ ions, and unfolding of the enzyme was evaluated by monitoring the changes in the α-helix content of the protein (222 nm). Thermal denaturation of the unliganded NS5B protein initially revealed a midpoint of thermal transition (Tm) of 40.2 °C (Fig. 3A). The addition of saturating concentrations of Mg2+ ions resulted in a shift of the Tm value to 45.7 °C. These results demonstrate that the binding of Mg2+ ions to the NS5B protein significantly increases the structural stability of the enzyme. Thermal stability was also monitored in terms of catalytic activity. This was done by preincubating either the unliganded NS5B protein or the protein saturated with magnesium ions for 15 min at various temperatures, followed by quenching on ice. The protein samples were then assayed for RNA polymerase activity at 18 °C in the standard RNA polymerase buffer. The thermal inactivation curves are shown in Fig. 3B. The results indicate that preincubation of the HCV RNA polymerase with Mg2+ ions protects the enzyme against thermal denaturation. The inactivation curve of the protein preincubated with magnesium ions is shifted 15 °C to the right relative to the enzyme that had not been preincubated with metal ions (Fig. 3B). Note that all of the denaturation assays, performed either with increasing GdmHCl concentrations or by thermal denaturation, revealed monophasic unfolding curves, suggestive of a two-state unfolding model. No intermediate form could be detected during the unfolding process. Thermodynamic Analysis—Using a combination of crystallography, fluorescence, and CD, the HCV RNA polymerase has previously been shown to interact with metal ions (27Bougie I. Charpentier S. Bisaillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3868-3875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 12513-12525Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the present study, a thermodynamic investigation of the metal ion binding process was initiated to provide additional insight into the energetic and entropic characteristics of the binding reaction. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, the thermodynamic parameters of the binding reaction were evaluated by determining the temperature dependence of the association constant (Kas) for Mg2+ ions. Analysis of the van't Hoff plot for the initial interaction between Mg2+ and the HCV RNA polymerase reveals that the interaction is connected with a high enthalpy of association, ΔHo = –33.4 kJ/mol (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the binding reaction is clearly enthalpy-driven with the resultant ΔSo = –88.7 J/mol·K. These data indicate that the reaction is spontaneous at low temperatures but tends to reverse at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the binding of metal ions could not be observed repeatedly at temperatures higher than 50 °C (data not shown). This can most probably be attributed to the denaturation of the protein that occurs at higher temperatures and the concomitant destabilization of the active site. Metal Ion Binding Increases Hydrophobic Exposure at Low Urea Concentrations—To gain additional insights into the structural modifications that occur upon metal ion binding, we investigated the binding of structural fluorescent reporters to the enzyme. The exposure of the hydrophobic area of the HCV RNA polymerase was evaluated by measuring the binding of ANS to the protein. ANS is a reporter of exposed hydrophobic surfaces on proteins which binds with high affinity to hydrophobic patches, which results in an enhancement of ANS intrinsic fluorescence (36Labowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 237-266Crossref Google Scholar). Our data revealed that the unliganded NS5B protein binds very weakly to ANS, probably reflecting limited hydrophobic regions at the surface of the protein (Fig. 5). However, a significant increase of the ANS fluorescence is observed when the protein is incubated in the presence of saturating concentrations of magnesium ions (Fig. 5). As expected, increasing the urea concentrations resulted in a drastic decrease of the emission intensity, as the protein with bound Mg2+ became unfolded by the denaturant. Overall, these data indicate that magnesium ion binding increases hydrophobic exposure on the HCV RNA polymerase surface. To understand better the conformational changes that occur after the binding of magnesium ions to the HCV RNA polymerase, quenching experiments were performed in the presence of acrylamide. Acrylamide is a nonselective quencher of proteins which can penetrate into the interior of the protein matrix (37Calhoun D.B. Vanderkoii J.M. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the absence of denaturant, acrylamide displayed greater accessibility for the NS5B protein bound to magnesium ions, reflecting the structural difference between the unliganded NS5B protein and the protein bound to Mg2+ ions (Fig. 6). As observed in our ANS binding assays, acrylamide has increased access to the interior of th"

PRK1/PKN is a member of the protein kinase C superfamily of serine/threonine kinases and is one of the first identified effectors for RhoA GTPase. However, the role of PRK1 in mediating signaling downstream of activated RhoA is largely unknown. Here, we present evidence that identifies a novel plasma membrane pool of PRK1. This integral membrane form of PRK1 is catalytically active. The phosphorylation of serine377 of PRK1 is required for its integration into membranes. This integration is essential for PRK1 to function as a Rho effector as only the integral plasma membrane PRK1 is able to initiate RhoA-mediated and ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of the androgen receptor in human epithelial cells and to mediate RhoA-induced neurite retraction in mouse neuronal cells. These results indicate that RhoA signals via the integral membrane pool of its effectors in its immediate vicinity at the plasma membrane, thus establishing a new paradigm in mammalian cell signaling."

The classical pathway of complement is activated when C1 (the first component of complement) binds to immune complexes, certain microbial antigens, or self-neoepitopes. C1 and the classical pathway of complement is thus an important component of both innate and adaptive immunity (12Sim R.B. Tsiftsoglou S.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13Morgan B.P. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 19: 173-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liszewski M.K. Farries T.C. Lublin D.M.

C1q is a 460-kDa protein that serves as a recognition molecule (15Kishore U. Reid K.B. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 16Arlaud G.J. Gaboriaud C.

Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The overall shape of C1q resembles a bouquet of flowers with six N-terminal collagen-like triple helix stalks and the C-terminal globular heterotrimeric “head” domains that comprise A, B, and C subunits (18Gregory L.A.

Upon binding to immunoglobulin-coated targets, C1q undergoes a conformational change that initiates a highly specific intramolecular proteolytic activation of the C1r(2)-C1s(2) tetramer. These events are followed by complement propagation, which includes the deposition of opsonins on the activating cell surface, the release of anaphylatoxins, and the formation of the terminal cytolytic membrane attack complex, which eventually leads to cell death (10Cole D.S. Morgan B.P. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2003; 104: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Sim R.B. Tsiftsoglou S.A. Biochem. Soc.

Another important, but less well understood, function of C1q is the induction of cell-specific functional responses mediated by its binding to receptors present on endothelial cells, dendritic cells, platelets, monocytes, lymphocytes, and leukocytes (15Kishore U. Reid K.B. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 49: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 21Ghebrehiwet B. Peerschke E.I. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 41: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). So far, a few putative C1q-binding receptors have been identified. These receptors, which are likely to mediate C1q functions, are calreticulin/cC1q-R, CD35/CR1, gC1q-R/p33, and CD93/C1q-Rp, although there is some controversy with the latter (22McGreal E. Gasque P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1010-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).We found, in the in vitro and in the cell-based assays, that MT1-MMP, in either its proteolytically active or inactive form, efficiently binds C1q in in vitro and cell-based assays. The catalytic domain of MT1-MMP and the C1q globular domain are involved in these receptor/ligand-like associations. The specificity of the MT1-MMP/C1q interactions was confirmed by MT1-MMP mutagenesis and by the identification of the interaction-deficient mutants. The binding of C1q to MT1-MMP does not activate complement and does not affect the proteolytic or TIMP-2 binding properties of MT1-MMP. We infer from our findings that the MT1-MMP·C1q complexes, rather than the individual MT1-MMP molecules, are predominantly exposed on the surface of either normal or neoplastic cells in the bloodstream.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. C1q, normal human serum, and C4-depleted guinea pig serum were purchased from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA). Human IgM was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Rabbit antibody AB815 against the hinge region of MT1-MMP, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, the TMB/M and TMB/E substrates, and GM6001 (a broad range hydroxamate inhibitor of MMPs) were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit anti-human C1q was procured from Cedarlane (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). The recombinant catalytic domain of human MT1-MMP (MT1-CAT) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from the inclusion bodies, refolded to restore its native conformation as previously described (23Ratnikov B. Deryugina E. Leng J. Marchenko G. Dembrow D. Strongin A. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and used in our cleavage experiments. Soluble MT1-CAT from Pichia (but not the E. coli-derived refolded MT1-CAT) was used in the C1q binding studies. Rabbit antibody to the MT1-CAT was generated in our laboratory (24Rozanov D. Ghebrehiwet B. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Deryugina E. Strongin A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The TIMP-2-free MMP-2 proenzyme was purified from the MMP-2-overexpressing stably transfected fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (25Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J.

To avoid the undesirable effects of complement in our assays, only heat-inactivated, complement-free sera were used in our experiments, unless otherwise indicated.Cell Lines—Human breast carcinoma MCF7 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, Virginia) stably transfected with the empty pcDNA3-zeo vector (Invitrogen) (control zeo cells), and with the full-length wild-type MT1-MMP (MT-WT cells), were extensively characterized in our previous works (7Rozanov D.V.

Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, which synthesize MT1-MMP naturally, were obtained from ATCC. Transfected cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Tissue Culture Biologicals, Tulare, CA) and 0.2 mg/ml zeocin.Protein Modeling—The protein modeling of the C1q A, B, and C subunits was performed using Modeler software (version 6v2, University of California, San Francisco). The 2.1-Å structure of the murine AdipoQ (Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 1C28), an abundant serum protein and a close homologue of the complement protein C1q protein (28Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template for building the models of human C1q. The high similarity of fold of human C1q A, B, and C subunits and murine AdipoQ was identified using the fold and function assignment system (FFAS) (ffas.ljcrf.edu). The modeled structures of the C1q subunits were validated using ProCheck (European Bioinformatics Institute, Cambridge, UK). The topology of the sterically unfavorable amino acid side chains of each of the subunits was corrected using an exhaustive search method (29Sikora S. Godzik A. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The recently published crystal structure of human C1q at 1.9 Å resolution (19Gaboriaud C. Juanhuix J. Gruez A. Lacroix M.

The docking parameters were: helix mode, grid step 1.7, repulsion 10, angle of rotation -100. The energy score distribution for docking of each subunit of C1q with MT1-CAT was analyzed. The most plausible score distribution was identified for docking between the A subunit and MT1-CAT. The energy score of the top-scoring model of the A subunit·MT1-CAT complex was -532. Similar scores are characteristic of the strongly interacting proteins (30Katchalski-Katzir E. Shariv I. Eisenstein M. Friesem A.A. Aflalo C. Vakser I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2195-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 31Vakser I.A. Proteins. 1997; : 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For comparison, the energy score for the top-scoring model of the C subunit and MT1-CAT interactions was -440. The five most probable models of C1q·MT1-MMP have been analyzed and validated. The final model of the C1q·MT1-CAT complex was built using the Swiss PDB viewer. Hydrogen bonds between the MT1-CAT and C1q subunit were also computed using the Swiss PDB viewer.Cell-free Transcription/Translation—The cDNA fragments encoding the peptide sequence of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (MT1-CAT Tyr112-Gly284), MT2-MMP (MT2-CAT Tyr132-Gly304), MT3-MMP (MT3-CAT Tyr120-Gly291), and MT4-MMP (MT4-CAT Gln129-Gly298) were each cloned into the pTNT plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The resulting recombinant pTNT plasmids were used as templates in the cell-free double transcription/translation system (Promega). Each transcription/translation reaction included 20 μl of the TNT T7 Quick Master mix, 1 μl of [35S]Met (10 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) and 1 μl of the respective recombinant pTNT plasmid (0.5 μg/ml). The reactions were incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. Aliquots were then withdrawn from each reaction, diluted 10-fold, and the 1-μl samples of the diluted aliquots were each analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by radioautography.In addition, the sequence of MT1-CAT was modified by converting the residues of the 133–136, 134–136, 171–174, 171–176, and 223–225 peptide sequence regions into the alanine residues. Mutations were inserted by using the QuikChange system (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and the oligonucleotide primers, which carry the required mutations. The following direct and reverse (respectively) mutagenic primers were used: Ala133–136 mutant, 5′-CTGCATCCAGAATTACACCGCCGCGGCGGCCGAGTATGCCACATACGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGTATGTGGCATACTCGGCCGCCGCGGCGGTGTAATTCTGGATGCAG-3′; Ala134–136 mutant, 5′-CATCCAGAATTACACCCCCGCGGCGGCCGAGTATGCCACATACGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGTATGTGGCATACTCGGCCGCCGCGGGGGTGTAATTCTGGATG-3′; Ala171–174 mutant, 5′-GCCTACATCCGTGAGGGCGCTGCGGCGGCGGCCGACATCATGATCTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATCATGATGTCGGCCGCCGCCGCAGCGCCCTCACGGGATGTAGGC-3′; Ala171–176 mutant, 5′-GCCTACATCCGTGAGGGCGCTGCGGCGGCGGCCGCCATCATGATCTTCTTTGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCAAAGAAGATCATGATGGCGGCCGCCGCCGCAGCGCCCTCACGGATGTAGGC-3′; and A223–225 mutant, 5′-CTCTGCCGAGCCTTGGACTGCCGCGGCTGAGGATCTGAATGGAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTCCATTCAGATCCTCAGCCGCGGCAGTCCAAGGCTCGGCAGAG-3′; nucleotides shown underlined bold indicate the altered codons). Following mutagenesis, the MT1-CAT mutants were recloned into the pTNT plasmid, and their structure was confirmed by sequencing.To evaluate the ability of the expressed constructs to bind with C1q, the wells of a 96-well plate were coated overnight at 4 °C with C1q (1 μg/ml) in 50 mm sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA. Aliquots (4 μl) of the transcription/translation reactions were mixed with PBS (100 μl) containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5% Triton X-100/1% BSA, and the samples were allowed to bind the wells for 1 h at 37 °C. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were solubilized in a 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by radioautography.Expression of the MT1-MMP Constructs in Yeast—The cloning, expression, and purification of the individual hemopexin domain (MT1-PEX) of MT1-MMP and the soluble C-end-truncated MT1-MMP, lacking both the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail (MT1-ΔTM/ΔCT), have been described in our previous publications (27Rozanov D.V.

The cDNA fragment coding for the Ala21-Gly284 peptide sequence of the prodomain, followed by the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP, was cloned in the pPIC9 plasmid (Invitrogen) under the control of the alcohol oxidase promoter and the α-mating factor signal peptide. Following the transformation of Pichia pastoris GS115 spheroplasts with the recombinant plasmid, the clones were grown and selected according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The expression levels of the construct were ∼2 mg/l in the most efficient clones, as assessed by Western blotting of the medium samples. To generate preparative amounts of MT1-CAT, the clones were grown for 48 h in 1 liter of BMGY medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter bactopeptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, 1% glycerol) and then for 24 h in BMMY medium (200 ml) (10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter bactopeptone, 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 0.4 mg/liter biotin, 0.5% methanol). MT1-CAT was purified from the medium by ammonium sulfate precipitation (70% saturation) followed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. MT1-CAT was eluted from the column with a 0–0.8 m NaCl gradient and detected in the eluted fractions by SDS-PAGE.Immunoprecipitation of Cell-deposited C1q—Following the incubation of the cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm plate) for 5 h with C1q (5 μg/ml), the cells were washed with PBS, surface biotinylated for 1 h at 4 °C with sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide long chain biotin (0.1 mg/ml) (Pierce), and lysed in 50 mmN-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Amresco, Solon, OH) in PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and a protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) and aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (1 μg/ml each)). The lysate samples were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Calbiochem). The precleared aliquots (1 mg total protein each) were immunoprecipitated with the C1q antibody (1 μg) and protein G-agarose beads. The precipitated material was analyzed by Western blotting with HRP-ExtrAvidin and a TMB/M substrate. Where indicated, GM6001 (50 μm) was co-incubated with the cells for 24 h prior to analyses and then included in all incubation buffers to block the proteolysis of cellular MT1-MMP.MT1-MMP Proteolysis C1q and α1-Antitrypsin (AAT)—C1q and AAT (1 μg each) were co-incubated with either MT1-CAT (15–50 ng) or MT1-MMP-ΔTM/ΔCT (100 ng) for 2 h at 37 °C in 15 μl of 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ZnCl2, 0.01% Brij-35, pH 6.8. The cleavage samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining.C4 Consumption Assay—Normal human serum was 100-fold diluted with GVB (veronal(barbital)-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (145 mm NaCl/5 mm sodium veronal), containing 0.1% gelatin, 0.15 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2). Aliquots of the diluted serum (20 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with equimolar amounts of human IgM (88 μg), MT1-CAT (2.7 μg), and BSA (5.4 mg) (each dissolved in PBS) or with PBS alone (total sample volume 40 μl). The samples (6 μl each) were next added to the mixture that included the antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (50 μl), C4-depleted guinea pig serum (10 μl), and GVB (450 μl). Following incubation for 1 h at 37 °C,the remaining erythrocytes were removed by centrifugation, and the A412 value of the supernatant was measured on a microplate reader. The efficiency of the observed hemolysis in the experimental samples was expressed as a percentage in comparison with the total hemolysis of the erythrocytes lysed in water.RESULTSModeling of MT1-MMP Interactions with C1q—Our previous studies suggested the existence of a link of MT1-MMP to the complement system and tumor immunity and demonstrated the ability of MT1-MMP to bind gC1q-R (p33), a protein that is capable of associating with C1q (24Rozanov D. Ghebrehiwet B. Ratnikov B. Monosov E. Deryugina E. Strongin A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 34Rozanov D.V. Ghebrehiwet B. Postnova T.I. Eichinger A. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9318-9325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, we tested whether MT1-MMP is capable of binding with C1q directly. First, we employed in silico modeling and protein-protein docking to determine a likely mode of the MT1-MMP/C1q interactions. According to our in silico studies, the catalytic domain of the MT1-MMP was capable of binding C1q, especially the A subunit. The top-scored MT1-MMP/C1q docking model (Fig. 1, top panel) has an energy score that is comparable with that of efficiently interacting heterodimer proteins. According to our in silico modeling, the 133PKVG136, 171HEKQAD176, and 223VRN225 sequence regions of the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP are probably involved in an association with C1q. Close-up of the 171HEKQAD176 region and the interacting amino acid residues involved in the MT1-MMP·C1q complex formation are shown in Fig. 1, bottom panel. The active site of MT1-MMP appears distant from the putative C1q binding site, suggesting that C1q is not a target of MT1-MMP proteolysis and that C1q will not interfere with MT1-MMP activity. These predictions were confirmed experimentally in our studies described below.Thus, in silico modeling suggested the likely mode of the MT1-MMP/C1q interactions and directed us to the sequence regions of MT1-MMP, where mutagenesis might affect the interactions between these two proteins. To corroborate these suggestions and to demonstrate, in an expedient manner, the capability of MT1-MMP to bind C1q, we employed a cell-free double transcription/translation system.Synthesis of MMPs in the Cell-free System and C1q Binding—To accomplish our studies, we expressed and purified the truncated soluble forms of MT1-MMP, including MT1-ΔTM/ΔCT, which lacks the trans-membrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail, the proMT1-CAT species that represents the prodomain followed by the catalytic domain, and finally, the individual hemopexin-like domain (MT1-PEX). In addition, we recloned, in the pTNT plasmid vector, the cDNA sequences that represented the unmodified individual catalytic domain of MT1-MMP (MT1-CAT) as well as the mutant MT1-CAT. In these mutants, the amino acid residues of the 133PKVG136, 171HEKQAD176, and 223VRN225 sequence regions were replaced with the alanine residues to generate the sequences 133AAAA136 (the Ala133–136 mutant), 134AAA136 (the Ala134–136 mutant), 171AAAAAD176 (the Ala171–174 mutant), 171AAAAAA176 (the Ala171–176 mutant), and 223AAA225 (the Ala223–225 mutant). The structure of the MT1-MMP forms used in the current study is schematically shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Schematic representation of the MT1-MMP constructs. Amino acid residues 108RRKR and HEL240 of the furin cleavage motif and the active site, respectively, are shown. Relative positions of the peptide sequence regions (underlined) modified by alanine mutagenesis are also shown at the bottom part of the figure.

Each of the individual templates was efficiently transcribed and translated in vitro and generated comparable amounts of the 35S-labeled MT1-CAT species of the expected size (Fig. 3A). Aliquots of the synthesized material were next allowed to bind C1q coated on plastic. After the removal of the unbound material by extensive washing, the bound MT1-CAT was eluted and evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by radioautography. All of the constructs, except the mutants Ala171–174, Ala171–176, and Ala223–225, were capable of binding with C1q (Fig. 3A). Luciferase, a product of the Renilla luciferase gene cloned in the pTNT vector and used as a negative control in our experiments, did not associate C1q (data not shown). An excess of unlabeled MT1-CAT and C1q, when added to the binding reactions, blocked the association of 35S-labeled MT1-CAT with C1q coated on plastic (data not shown). These findings agreed closely enough with our in silico modeling findings to confirm that the catalytic domain of MT1-MMP is capable of direct interaction with C1q and that the sequence regions 171HEKQAD176 and 223VRN225 (but not the 133PKVG136 peptide sequence) of the MT1-MMP molecule are essential for these interactions.Fig. 3The cell-free transcription/translation system. The wild-type MT1-CAT and mutant MT1-CAT with the modified sequence regions 133–136 (Ala133–136), 134–136 (Ala134–136), 171–174 (Ala171–174), 171–176 (Ala171–176), and 223–225 (Ala223–225), as well as the wild-type MT2-CAT, MT3-CAT, and MT4-CAT were each synthesized and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]Met using the cell-free system. Aliquots of the reactions were evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by radioautography (upper panels). Aliquots of the synthesized material were next allowed to bind C1q coated on plastic.

https://openalex.org/W2032406332,"We analyzed pre-steady state and single turnover kinetics of bacteriophage T4Dam DNA-(adenine-N6)-methyltransferase-mediated methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to 40-mer duplexes containing native recognition sites (5′-GATC/5′-GATC) or some modified variant(s). The results extend a model from studies with single-site 20-mer duplexes. Under pre-steady state conditions, monomeric T4Dam methyltransferase-AdoMet complexes were capable of rapid methylation of adenine residues in 40-mer duplexes containing two sites. During processive movement of T4Dam to the next site, the rate-limiting step was the exchange of the product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) for AdoMet without T4Dam dissociating from the duplex. Consequently, instead of a single exponential rate dependence, complex methylation curves were obtained with at least two pre-steady state steps. With 40-mer duplexes containing a single target site, the kinetics were simpler, fitting a single exponential followed by a linear steady state phase. Single turnover methylation of 40-mer duplexes also proceeded in two stages. First, two dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet molecules bound, and each catalyzed a two-step methylation. Instead of processive movement of T4Dam, a conformational adaptation occurred. We propose that following methyl transfer to one strand, dimeric (T4Dam-AdoMet)-(T4Dam-AdoHcy) was capable of rapidly reorienting itself and catalyzing methyl transfer to the target adenine on the complementary, unmethylated strand. This second stage methyl transfer occurred at a rate about 25-fold slower than in the first step; it was rate-limited by Dam-AdoHcy dissociation or its clearance from the methylated complementary strand. Under single turnover conditions, there was complete methylation of all target adenine residues with each of the two-site 40-mer duplexes. We analyzed pre-steady state and single turnover kinetics of bacteriophage T4Dam DNA-(adenine-N6)-methyltransferase-mediated methyl group transfer from S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) to 40-mer duplexes containing native recognition sites (5′-GATC/5′-GATC) or some modified variant(s).

We propose that following methyl transfer to one strand, dimeric (T4Dam-AdoMet)-(T4Dam-AdoHcy) was capable of rapidly reorienting itself and catalyzing methyl transfer to the target adenine on the complementary, unmethylated strand. This second stage methyl transfer occurred at a rate about 25-fold slower than in the first step; it was rate-limited by Dam-AdoHcy dissociation or its clearance from the methylated complementary strand. Under single turnover conditions, there was complete methylation of all target adenine residues with each of the two-site 40-mer duplexes. DNA methylation is extremely important for the control of such processes as transcription, genomic imprinting, regulation of development, restoration of the correct structure of DNA, and chromatin organization (1Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to most prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases (MTases), 1The abbreviations used are: MTase, methyltransferase; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; AdoHcy, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; hmCyt, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. the Dam MTase is not a component of a restriction-modification system; rather, Dam methylation has other important cellular functions such as methyl-directed mismatch repair (reviewed in Ref. 2Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6597-6600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and bacterial virulence (3Heithoff D.M. Sinsheimer R.L. Low D.A. Mahan M.J. Science. 1999; 284: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In the latter instance, despite the presence of a large number of virulence factors for intestinal bacteria (>20), it was sufficient to switch off the gene for the Dam DNA MTase to obtain avirulent live vaccine. Like all natural MTases, Dam MTases use the universal donor, S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), transferring methyl groups to the Ade residues in the palindromic sequence 5′-GATC-3′ (1Jeltsch A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, we carried out kinetic analyses of T4Dam-mediated methyl group transfer to oligodeoxynucleotide duplexes containing one or two specific GATC sites with different combinations of (un)methylated targets (reviewed in Ref. 4Hattman S. Malygin E.G. Moldave K. Progess in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology. 77. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam2004: 67-126Google Scholar). The results for ligated 40-mer duplexes with those of the mixtures of the two unligated duplexes used to generate the 40-mer were compared (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The salient results are summarized as follows: (i) T4Dam MTase modifies the 40-mer duplexes in a processive fashion. (ii) During processive movement on DNA from one site to the next, T4Dam was capable of rapidly exchanging product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) in the ternary complex for substrate AdoMet. (iii) The processive steps of T4Dam action were consistent with an ordered bi-bi mechanism AdoMet↓DNA↓ DNAMe↑AdoHcy↑. However, in contrast to the steady state, here DNAMe↑ signifies the departure of T4Dam from a methylated site GMTC↑ without physically dissociating from the DNA molecule (M denotes N6-methyladenine, m6Ade). (iv) Following methyl transfer at one site and linear diffusion to a hemimethylated site, T4Dam was capable of rapidly reorienting itself to the (productive) unmethylated strand. (v) The inhibition potential of fully methylated sites 5′-GMTC/5′-GMTC was much lower in a long DNA molecule as compared with short single-site duplexes. (vi) The T4Dam structural state depended on the molar ratio of the enzyme/duplex (6Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If [T4Dam] « [DNA] ((pre)-steady state conditions), then the enzyme was monomeric. In contrast, if [T4Dam] > [DNA] (single turnover conditions), then the enzyme was mainly dimeric; however, both enzymatic forms were catalytically active (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M.

Since the results summarized above were based primarily on steady state and single turnover methylation studies (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the present work was undertaken to determine whether methylation under pre-steady state conditions would yield results consistent with the kinetic model we proposed previously (8Evdokimov A.A.

Enzymes and Chemicals—[3H-CH3]-AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol; 1 mCi/ml) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma) was purified further by chromatography on a C18-reversedphase column as described previously (9Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides (see Table I) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA), and their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. Duplexes were obtained by heating and annealing complementary oligodeoxynucleotide chains from 90 to 20 °C over 7–12 h. The 40-mer duplexes were constructed from shorter component duplexes using T4 polynucleotide kinase and T4 DNA ligase (SibEnzyme). All 40-mer duplexes had the same general structure except for the combinations of unmodified/modified Ade residues in the four 5′-GATC-3′ sites. For example, in the ligated 40-mer duplex shown below, the numbers in quotation marks (odd for upper strand and even for the bottom strand) mark the four potential methylation targets.

Open table in a new tab DNA MTase Assay—DNA MTase assays were similar to that reported previously (12Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). T4Dam reactions were carried out at 25 °C in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (9Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Methyl transfer assays were carried out at 25 °C as described (13Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 100 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, 10 μm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The microvolume rapid quench instrument RQF-3′ (KinTek Corp.) was used for pre-steady state assays. Syringes, mixers, and age loops were equilibrated to 25 °C. The feeding syringe containing the enzyme preparation was kept at 0 °C to avoid inactivation of the T4Dam MTase during the experiment. SDS (0.15% (w/v)) in 25 mm Tris-glycine (pH 8.3) was used as the quench solution. The concentrations of reagents for burst and single turnover measurements were as follows: burst, 50 nm T4Dam, 500 nm 40-mer duplex (total concentration of specific sites is indicated), 5 μm AdoMet; single turnover, 500 nm T4Dam, 50 nm 40-mer duplex (total concentration of specific sites is indicated), 5 μm AdoMet. The quenched samples were collected in Eppendorf tubes and evaporated to a volume of 100 μl using an Eppendorf vacuum concentrator. Duplicate 50-μl aliquots were spotted onto DE81 anion-exchange filter paper (Whatman, 2.5 cm) for counting 3H cpm. The molar concentration of 3H-CH3-labeled groups incorporated into DNA was quantified as described earlier (14Thielking V. Dubois S. Eritja R. Guschlbauer W. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 407-415PubMed Google Scholar, 15, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Kinetic parameters were obtained by using the computer program Scientist (MicroMath Inc.) for regression analysis to fit the experimental data. Pre-steady State Methylation of the 40-mer Duplexes—The results of measurements of pre-steady state methylation of 40-mer duplexes are presented in Fig. 1 and Table I. It is clear that among all the curves, only those for duplexes 40E and 40F have a classical form with a fast exponential phase accompanied by linear part of the curve, which can be described by an empirical equation.[3H-DNA]/[enzyme]=P(1−e−kmeth⋅t)+kcatt(Eq.1) Here P is the burst of product normalized to [enzyme], kmeth is the rate of methyl transfer, and kcat is the steady state reaction rate constant. The curves for 40-mer duplexes 40A–40D are more curvilinear and are best described by a more complex kinetic equation, which includes at least two exponential phases. We tried fitting the experimental data to an equation that describes a two-step burst reaction (13Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that then continues into a steady state phase.[3H-DNA]/[enzyme]=P2−(P1⋅kmeth1−P2⋅kmeth2)⋅e−kmeth1⋅t/(kmeth1−kmeth2)−(P2−P1)⋅e−kmeth2⋅t⋅kmeth1/(kmeth1−kmeth2)+kcatt(Eq.2) Here kmeth1 is the rate constant for methylation of the first target Ade residue, and kmeth2 is the methylation rate constant for methylation of the second Ade residue. P1 is the methylation level/bound duplex attained after the first step of the burst reaction (resulting from enzyme molecules initially bound to the productive strand). P2 is the total methylation level/bound duplex after both steps of the burst reaction have taken place, and kcat is the rate constant of the steady state phase. As seen in Table I, according to the two-step model, during the burst, the first Ade residue was methylated at a relatively rapid rate as compared with that for the second Ade residue. For example, with duplex 40A having all four unmodified target Ade residues, modification of the first Ade residue proceeded rapidly (kmeth1 = 1.49 s–1), whereas the rate constant for methylation of a second Ade was 10-fold lower (kmeth2 = 0.15 s–1). In the first step of the burst, there was methylation of one Ade residue/bound 40-mer duplex (P1 = 1.05), and almost two Ade residues were methylated (P1 = 1.83) upon completion of the burst. As postulated earlier (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the second step of the burst reaction reflects a movement of T4Dam-AdoHcy from the methylated site to a nonspecific sequence, exchange of AdoHcy by AdoMet, movement of the T4Dam-AdoMet complex to a next specific site, and then methyl transfer. The rate of this combined process (kmeth2 = 0.15 s–1) was 10-fold lower than that of the first burst phase but 10-fold higher than steady state rate (kcat = 0.01 s–1). Methylation of duplex 40B, containing one unmodified (A/A) and one hemimethylated (M/A) site, proceeded somewhat differently. The rate constant of the first burst (kmeth1) was approximately the same as for duplex 40A, and the methylation level (P1) was 0.66. However, the yield of the entire burst (P2) was the same as that for duplex 40A, although the rate constant of the second methylation phase (kmeth2) was 30-fold lower. Duplexes 40C and 40D contain two (un)methylated Ade residues located in cis or trans with respect to one another. These duplexes also showed a slight reduction in methylation level in the first reaction step (P1 = 0.64–0.65), and the rate constant for the second methyl transfer was lower by about 25-fold. Surprisingly, methylation of duplex 40D (two target Ade residues on opposite chains in trans configuration) was about 2-fold faster in both burst steps as compared with duplex 40C, in which the two target Ade residues were in cis. The reduction in rate constant for the second methylation step with 40-mer duplexes A–D may reflect the process of enzyme release/shift from the first site, exchange of AdoHcy for AdoMet, and methylation of the second Ade residue. In contrast, the pre-steady state methylation kinetics of duplexes 40E (containing one fully methylated (M/M) site and one unmethylated (A/A) site) and 40F (containing one fully methylated (M/M) site and one hemimethylated (M/A) site) were relatively simpler than for duplexes 40A–D. In fact, it was quite similar to methylation of a 20-mer duplex containing a single methylation site (13Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4207-4211Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, methylation kinetics for duplexes 40E and 40F fit a curve corresponding to Equation 1, which describes the first step as a rapid, irreversible substrate conversion followed by a steady state phase. In both cases, the presence of an adjacent, completely methylated (M/M) site did not negatively affect methylation of the adjacent target Ade. Therefore, we can suppose that a T4Dam-AdoMet complex efficiently searches for the unmodified target Ade residue without binding the adjacent GMTC/GMTC sequence. Although the two duplexes gave burst values of about 0.9, the kmeth1 value was ∼2-fold greater for duplex 40F. Further studies are necessary to determine whether T4Dam prefers hemimethylated sites. Single Turnover Methylation of the 40-mer Duplexes—The experimental curves and kinetic parameters for single turnover methylation of the 40-mer duplexes are presented in Fig. 2 and Table I. As for 20-mer duplexes containing one specific site (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the single turnover curves could not be fitted to a single exponential equation. Rather, they were fitted to the two-exponential equation,[3H-DNA]/[duplex]=P2−(P1⋅kmeth1−P2⋅kmeth2)⋅e−kmeth1⋅t/(kmeth1−kmeth2)−(P2−P1)⋅e−kmeth2⋅t⋅kmeth1/(kmeth1−kmeth2)(Eq.3) The two-exponential fit, which encompasses the whole curve, provides similar values of methylation levels, P1 for the first exponential, and (P2–P1) value for the second exponential (except for duplex 40E) but different values for the kmeth constants were obtained. It is clear that unmodified duplex 40A was half-methylated after the first exponential step of the reaction. Thus, in the presence of saturating concentrations of AdoMet, dimeric T4Dam was capable of rapidly modifying two Ade residues when the substrate duplex contained two specific unmodified sites. This is in contrast to a 20-mer substrate duplex with one specific site, where under conditions of single turnover, only one Ade residue was rapidly methylated (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One can suppose that two dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet complexes bind a 40-mer duplex containing two unmodified sites and rapidly methylate single Ade residues. However, the rate of the second Ade methylation on the complementary strand is 25-fold lower than in the first step. The kinetic characteristics of duplex 40B methylation were comparable with that of duplex 40A, although the P1 and P2 values were lower proportionally according to the content of unmodified Ade residues. Duplexes 40C, 40D, and 40E each contain two target Ade residues, but they are distributed differently in the two specific sites. Nevertheless, the methylation levels of the two reaction steps had similar P1 and P2 values. One difference is that values for the rate constants kmeth1 and kmeth2 with duplex 40C were ∼2-fold higher. Thus, the combination of two target Ade residues on one strand may facilitate more rapid (and processive) methylation than with the other target combinations. In this regard, the target site configuration on duplex 40C mimics hemimethylated polymeric DNA produced by semiconservative replication. Duplex 40F contains a single unmodified target Ade residue in a hemimethylated (M/A) site that is adjacent to a fully methylated site. Unexpectedly, the rate constant (kmeth1 = 2.14) for the first methylation step was the highest of all the duplexes while exhibiting the lowest level of methylation (P1 = 0.25) of all the duplexes. However, complete methylation was attained (P2 = 1.32). The occurrence of two-step single turnover kinetics with duplexes containing one unmodified target Ade residue has been discussed previously (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to compare the single turnover methylation parameters of duplexes 40E and 40F (Table II) with their component 20-mer duplexes (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). There was good agreement between the kmeth2 values for the two 40-mer duplexes and their component 20-mer duplexes. As suggested previously (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), these values characterize methylation of the second strand, which is rate-limited either by Dam-(AdoHcy/AdoMet) dissociation or by its clearance from the methylated complementary strand. In contrast, the kmeth1 values are 4–5-fold higher for the 40-mer duplexes. This may indicate a more rapid adaptation of the two T4Dam dimers to the longer duplexes to form a productive complex. Finally, in all cases, P2 values were somewhat higher than the theoretical limits of methylation of the studied duplexes. It is possible that some methylation of Ade residues takes place in the sequence 5′-GATG-3′ located in the middle of 40-mer duplexes. Recently, it was shown that such a sequence can be methylated by T4Dam, albeit at a reduced rate (16Minko I. Hattman S. Lloyd R.S. Kossykh V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The main objective of the present work was to compare T4Dam MTase pre-steady state ([E] « [D]) versus single turnover ([E] > [D]) methylation in vitro of various 40-mer duplexes having two target sites. The distinction between the single turnover versus (pre)steady state reaction is that T4Dam functions as a dimer under single turnover conditions, whereas monomeric T4Dam functions under (pre)steady state conditions (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Since our prior studies focused mainly on steady state and single turnover methylation, the present work was undertaken to determine whether the results under pre-steady state conditions would be consistent with our kinetic model (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Pre-steady State Methylation Catalyzed by Monomeric T4Dam—The curvilinearity of the plots for pre-steady state methylation of duplexes 40A–D dictates a kinetic model in which there is more than one exponential step. A fitting of the experimental curves for these substrates by the Scientist and DinaFit programs showed that the model selection criterion values were comparable for reaction schemes with two or three exponential steps in the methylation burst. Calculations of the two-step and three-step model probabilities by means of Dina-Fit showed in all cases close to a 100% advantage of the two-exponential model. Thus, the principle of “Occam's razor” (included in the program) chose the simplest model described by the experimental data. Table I shows that the total burst value (P2) for duplexes 40A–D was almost 2. This agrees well with the results for methylation under steady state conditions, and it supports the kinetic model proposed earlier (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This model proposed that following the first methyl transfer, T4Dam-product AdoHcy moves preferentially in the 5′ → 3′ direction along the DNA strand until AdoHcy exchanges for substrate AdoMet and that T4Dam-AdoMet can reorient at a hemimethylated site, where the target Ade is on the opposite strand. However, T4Dam-AdoHcy cannot reorient and diffuses away from such a site. It should be noted the kmeth2 value with duplex 40A is similar to the kcat = 0.14 s–1 for steady state methylation of highly polymeric native T4 phage DNA (9Kossykh V.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14389-14393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be supposed that kmeth2 reflects the rate-limiting step during steady state (processive) methylation of polymeric DNA; this is 10-fold faster than steady state methylation of short DNA duplexes, in which the kcat is ∼0.015 s–1 (12Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Gorbunov Yu A. Malygin E.G. Kossykh V.G. Hattman S. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the structural dynamics of hemimethylated GATC sites revealed that hemimethylated DNA has an unusual backbone structure and a narrower major groove (17Bae S.-H. Cheong H.-K. Cheong C. Hwang D.S. Choi B.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45987-45993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Perhaps different combinations of (un)modified targets and/or their relative positions in the 40-mer duplex affect their interaction with T4Dam. More detailed analyses are needed, in particular, measurements of pre-steady state methylation kinetics of individual strand/targets. Single Turnover Methylation Catalyzed by Dimeric T4Dam— T4Dam is monomeric in solution (6Malygin E.G. Evdokimov A.A. Zinoviev V.V. Ovechkina L.G. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2361-2369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but at (sub)stoichiometric ratios of specific sites/enzyme, functionally active dimer-oligomers are formed (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the x-ray analysis of a crystal structure of the triple complex, T4Dam-AdoHcy-DNA, in which the ratio of [enzyme]/[DNA] (a 12-mer duplex) was 2 (18Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results permit the inclusion of T4Dam in the group of dissociating enzyme systems (19Kurganov B.I. Allosteric Enzymes: Kinetic Behavior. John Wiley and Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1982: 151-218Google Scholar), for which it is suggested that dissociation/association processes play an important role in regulating in vivo activity. Thus, a fundamental distinction of the single turnover versus presteady state reaction is that dimeric (not monomeric) T4Dam is functioning under the conditions in which [E] > [D]. Under these conditions, methylation of 20-mer duplexes containing one target site proceeded via two steps, as described by Equation 3 (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This was explained as follows. First, two preformed T4Dam-AdoMet complexes bind opposite strands of the unmodified target site, and one enzyme molecule catalyzes the rapid transfer of the AdoMet-methyl group. In the second stage, methyl transfer to Ade in GATC on the complementary strand occurs at a rate that is an order of magnitude slower. It was postulated that under single turnover conditions, methylation of the second strand is rate-limited by Dam-(AdoHcy/AdoMet) dissociation and/or by its clearance from the methylated complementary strand. Thus, we propose that two dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet complexes bind the 40-mer duplex and each catalyzes a two-step methylation. Hence, under single turnover conditions, processive movement of enzyme is likely to be precluded; rather, a conformational adaptation is required (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet complexes on duplexes containing two specific sites may not be independent since there were variations in the kinetic constants depending on the methylation status of the adjacent sites (Table I). Interestingly, higher values of kmeth1 and kmeth2 were observed for duplex 40C, which represents an analog of hemimethylated DNA. Another distinction between the single turnover versus presteady state reaction is the question of structural symmetry. In the pre-steady state reaction catalyzed by monomeric T4Dam, the experimental data were satisfactorily explained assuming that enzyme movement is unidirectional (5′ → 3′) from one site to other for methylation (5Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Malygin E.G. Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7829-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In single turnover, dimeric T4Dam-AdoMet complexed with duplex DNA initially forms a topologically symmetrical figure. Hence, a dimeric enzyme does not “know where to go” and its linear diffusion is chaotic, or there must be some additional structural details that determine the direction of movement along the DNA. However, after the first methyl group transfer, the complex becomes asymmetric in that (T4Dam-AdoMet)-(T4Dam-AdoMet) is bound on one strand and (T4Dam-AdoMet)-(T4Dam-AdoHcy) is on the other strand. In this regard, it is surprising that the three-dimensional x-ray structure of T4Dam-AdoHcy complexed with a self-complementary 12-mer DNA duplex revealed a complex of two T4Dam-AdoHcy molecules/12-mer duplex with two different space structures (18Yang Z. Horton J.R. Zhou L. Zhang X.J. Dong A. Zhang X. Schlagman S.L. Kossykh V. Hattman S. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). How these initially symmetric molecules form an asymmetric complex structure is not understood, although the cases in which identical subunits adopt similar but different positions (this is termed quasi-symmetry) are known for viral capsid proteins (20Goodsell D.S. Olson A.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 105-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). It was suggested that because of its asymmetric nature, hemimethylated DNA resulting from replication is the in vivo substrate for monomeric DNA MTases (21Dubey A.K. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 31657-317329Google Scholar). However, this might simply result from an in vivo stoichiometry of [enzyme]/[sites] « 1.0. In this regard, most DNA-(adenine-N6)-MTases appear to be functionally active monomers in vitro (22Modrich P. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 13: 287-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, RsrI DNA MTase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (23Kaszubska W. Webb H.K. Gumport R.I. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and two MTases from Streptococcus pneumoniae (24de la Campa A.G. Kale P. Springhorn S.S. Lacks S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) exist as dimers in solution. The Caulobacter crescentus DNA-(adenine-N6)-MTase (CcrM) is dimeric at physiological concentrations but is active as a monomer; a possible in vivo role for dimerization as a means to stabilize CcrM from premature catabolism was proposed (25Shier V.K. Hancey C.J. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14744-14751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that KpnI DNA-(adenine-N6)-MTase from Klebsiella pneumoniae is a dimer in solution (26Bheemanaik S. Chandrachekaran S. Nagaraja V. Rao D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7863-7874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as suggested by the nonlinear dependence of methylation activity on enzyme concentration. Although MspI DNA-(cytosine-C5)-MTase is dimeric at high protein concentrations, this appears to reflect enzyme aggregation rather than functional activity (27Dubey A.K. Mollet B. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1579-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human placental DNA-(cytosine-C5)-MTase forms a dimer in solution that is active in methylating dI-dC-containing polynucleotides (28Yoo H.Y. Noshari J. Lapeyre J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8066-8070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional insight into protein-protein interactions follows from the structural study of a mutant of HhaI DNA MTase, in which the dimeric state in crystal lattices and solution was shown (29Dong A. Zhou L Zhang X Stickel S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, comparison with other structurally characterized DNA MTases (HaeIII, human Dnmt2, PvuII, TaqI, RsrI, MboII, and T4Dam) demonstrated that they also can be found as a 2-fold related dimer, although a general dimer configuration is individual and different in each case (29Dong A. Zhou L Zhang X Stickel S. Roberts R.J. Cheng X. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, the old postulate that DNA MTases are active as monomers is not so strict, and dimeric MTases as potential natural catalysts have to be studied in more detail. We conclude that T4Dam MTase activity and function in vitro are affected by its oligomeric state. In the monomeric form, the reaction occurs under pre-steady state conditions in which the T4Dam MTase-AdoMet complexes rapidly methylate target Ade residues in the 40-mer duplexes containing two sites, even when one of the sites is fully methylated. As the T4Dam MTase processively moves to adjacent sites without dissociating from the DNA duplex, the exchange of AdoHcy product for the AdoMet substrate in the ternary complex becomes rate-limiting. This explains the multiple exponential rate dependence due to the presence of at least two pre-steady state steps in the methylation reaction. In complexes containing a single target site, the linear steady state phase followed a single exponential step. In the dimeric form, in which the reaction takes place under single turnover conditions, two T4Dam molecules bind a 40-mer duplex and catalyze a two-step methylation at each site. There is clearly no processive movement of the enzyme but rather a conformational change, as described for the single turnover methylation of the 20-merspecific complexes (7Malygin E.G. Lindstrom Jr., W.M. Zinoviev V.V. Evdokimov A.A. Schlagman S.L. Reich N.O. Hattman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41749-41755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Complete methylation of all target Ade residues in the 40-mer target site duplexes occurs during single turnover reactions and following methyl transfer on one strand; the dimeric form of the enzyme is capable of rapidly reorienting itself to methylate the unmethylated strand. T4Dam DNA Methylation in Vivo—It should be noted that the DNAs of phages T2, T4, and T6 are unusual in that they contain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hmCyt) in place of cytosine (30Wyatt G.R. Cohen S.S. Nature. 1952; 170: 1072-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and these hmCyt residues are modified further by glucosylation in a phage-specific pattern (31Lehman I.R. Pratt E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 3254-3259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although T2 and T4 DNAs have m6Ade, T6 lacks any detectable DNA-adenine methylation (32Hattman S. Virology. 1970; 42: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) due to the fact that it appears to have no dam gene encoding the MTase (33Miner Z. Hattman S. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5177-5184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together with the fact that null dam mutants of T2 and T4 lack detectable m6Ade (34Revel H.R. Hattman S. Virology. 1971; 45: 484-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), these results show that DNA-adenine methylation is not essential for phage viability and that the host Dam MTase is unable to methylate phage hmCyt-DNA. The latter is true whether or not the hmCyt residues are glucosylated (32Hattman S. Virology. 1970; 42: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The natural in vivo substrate for phage Dam MTase methylation is the polymeric hemimethylated, hemiglucosylated region trailing the replication fork generated by semiconservative replication. However, glucosylation reduces the T2 and T4 m6Ade levels (32Hattman S. Virology. 1970; 42: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), suggesting that G-A-T-Glu∼hmC (where Glu∼hmC represents glucosylated hmCyt) is a poorer substrate than G-A-T-hmC; in addition, binding/movement of glucosyl transferase molecules on the DNA might compete with the action of the MTase. In this regard, glucosylation-defective T4gt mutants fully methylate all G-A-T-hmC sites prior to phage DNA maturation into virion particles (35Schlagman S.L. Hattman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9101-9112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, T4 Dam MTase is not limiting during infection of a permissive host, although we do not know whether single turnover or steady state (or both) conditions prevail in vivo. Since Dam methylation is not essential for phage viability, then what (if any) is its biological function? Contrary to the role of the Dam MTase of the host cell, there is no evidence that T4Dam functions in a methyl-directed mismatch repair system. This follows from the observation that the rate of spontaneous T4 mutation is unaffected in host mutH, mutL, mutS, and mutU (uvrD) mutants (36Santos M.E. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1994; 138: 553-564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli Dam methylation also plays a role in positive and negative regulation of cell gene transcription (37Oshima T. Wada C. Kawagoe Y. Ara T. Maeda M. Masuda Y. Hiraga S. Mori H. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 673-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 38Løbner-Oleson A. Marinus M.G. Hansen F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4672-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, phage Dam methylation might modulate viral gene(s) expression. Although not essential for transcription, the ability to fine-tune the levels of mRNA could offer a slightly greater “fitness” to dam+versus dam– phages. This might not be an issue in defined laboratory host strains, but in the wild, it might provide a selective growth advantage. To our knowledge, this question has not been addressed experimentally."
