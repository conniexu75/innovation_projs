Previously, we identified a large family of mammalian taste receptors involved in bitter taste perception (the T2Rs). We now report the characterization of mammalian sweet taste receptors. First, transgenic rescue experiments prove that the Sac locus encodes T1R3, a member of the T1R family of candidate taste receptors. Second, using a heterologous expression system, we demonstrate that T1R2 and T1R3 combine to function as a sweet receptor, recognizing sweet-tasting molecules as diverse as sucrose, saccharin, dulcin, and acesulfame-K. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of the patterns of expression of T1Rs and T2Rs, thus providing a view of the representation of sweet and bitter taste at the periphery."
https://openalex.org/W2012751406,"The B cell activating factor BAFF (BlyS/TALL-1/zTNF4) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related ligand that promotes B cell survival and binds to three receptors (BCMA, TACI, and the recently described BAFF-R). Here we report an absolute requirement for BAFF in normal B cell development. Examination of secondary lymphoid organs from BAFF-deficient mice revealed an almost complete loss of follicular and marginal zone B lymphocytes. In contrast, mice lacking BCMA had normal-appearing B lymphocyte compartments. BAFF therefore plays a crucial role in B cell development and can function through receptors other than BCMA."
https://openalex.org/W2135668656,"B cell homeostasis has been shown to critically depend on BAFF, the B cell activation factor from the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. Although BAFF is already known to bind two receptors, BCMA and TACI, we have identified a third receptor for BAFF that we have termed BAFF-R. BAFF-R binding appears to be highly specific for BAFF, suggesting a unique role for this ligand-receptor interaction. Consistent with this, the BAFF-R locus is disrupted in A/WySnJ mice, which display a B cell phenotype qualitatively similar to that of the BAFF-deficient mice. Thus, BAFF-R appears to be the principal receptor for BAFF-mediated mature B cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W1991487604,"Alternative splicing of Wt1 results in the insertion or omission of the three amino acids KTS between zinc fingers 3 and 4. In vitro experiments suggest distinct molecular functions for + and -KTS isoforms. We have generated mouse strains in which specific isoforms have been removed. Heterozygous mice with a reduction of +KTS levels develop glomerulosclerosis and represent a model for Frasier syndrome. Homozygous mutants of both strains die after birth due to kidney defects. Strikingly, mice lacking +KTS isoforms show a complete XY sex reversal due to a dramatic reduction of Sry expression levels. Our data demonstrate distinct functions for the two splice variants and place the +KTS variants as important regulators for Sry in the sex determination pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2006153112,"Arabidopsis seedling photomorphogenesis involves two antagonistically acting components, COP1 and HY5. COP1 specifically targets HY5 for degradation via the 26S proteasome in the dark through their direct physical interaction. Little is known regarding how light signals perceived by photoreceptors are transduced to regulate COP1. Arabidopsis has two related cryptochromes (cry1 and cry2) mediating various blue/ultraviolet-A light responses. Here we show that both photoactivated cryptochromes repress COP1 activity through a direct protein-protein contact and that this direct regulation is primarily responsible for the cryptochrome-mediated blue light regulation of seedling photomorphogenic development and genome expression profile."
https://openalex.org/W1964414141,"The crystal structure of a novel aluminium fluoride inhibited form of bovine mitochondrial F(1)-ATPase has been determined at 2 A resolution. In contrast to all previously determined structures of the bovine enzyme, all three catalytic sites are occupied by nucleotide. The subunit that did not bind nucleotide in previous structures binds ADP and sulfate (mimicking phosphate), and adopts a ""half-closed"" conformation. This structure probably represents the posthydrolysis, pre-product release step on the catalytic pathway. A catalytic scheme for hydrolysis (and synthesis) at physiological rates and a mechanism for the ATP-driven rotation of the gamma subunit are proposed based on the crystal structures of the bovine enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2036155956,"Sister of P-glycoprotein (SPGP) is the major hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP). BSEP/SPGP expression varies dramatically among human livers. The potency and hierarchy of bile acids as ligands for the farnesyl/bile acid receptor (FXR/BAR) paralleled their ability to induce BSEP in human hepatocyte cultures. FXR:RXR heterodimers bound to IR1 elements and enhanced bile acid transcriptional activation of the mouse and human BSEP/SPGP promoters. In FXR/BAR nullizygous mice, which have dramatically reduced BSEP/SPGP levels, hepatic CYP3A11 and CYP2B10 were strongly but unexpectedly induced. Notably, the rank order of bile acids as CYP3A4 inducers and activators of pregnane X receptor/steroid and xenobiotic receptor (PXR/SXR) closely paralleled each other but was markedly different from their hierarchy and potency as inducers of BSEP in human hepatocytes. Moreover, the hepatoprotective bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, which reverses hydrophobic bile acid hepatotoxicity, activates PXR and efficaciously induces CYP3A4 (a bile-metabolizing enzyme) in primary human hepatocytes thus providing one mechanism for its hepatoprotection. Because serum and urinary bile acids increased in FXR/BAR −/− mice, we evaluated hepatic transporters for compensatory changes that might circumvent the profound decrease in BSEP/SPGP. We found weak MRP3 up-regulation. In contrast, MRP4 was substantially increased in the FXR/BAR nullizygous mice and was further elevated by cholic acid. Thus, enhanced hepatocellular concentrations of bile acids, due to the down-regulation of BSEP/SPGP-mediated efflux in FXR nullizygous mice, result in an alternate but apparent compensatory up-regulation of CYP3A, CYP2B, and some ABC transporters that is consistent with activation of PXR/SXR by bile acids."
https://openalex.org/W2171393588,"The increased tumor incidence in telomerase null mice suggests that telomere dysfunction induces genetic instability. To test this directly, we examined mutation rate in the absence of telomerase in S. cerevisiae. The mutation rate in the CAN1 gene increased 10- to 100-fold in est1Δ strains as telomeres became dysfunctional. This increased mutation rate resulted from an increased frequency of terminal deletions. Chromosome fusions were recovered from est1Δ strains, suggesting that the terminal deletions may occur by a breakage-fusion-bridge type mechanism. At one locus, chromosomes with terminal deletions gained a new telomere through a Rad52p-dependent, Rad51p-independent process consistent with break-induced replication. At a second locus, more complicated rearrangements involving multiple chromosomes were seen. These data suggest that telomerase can inhibit chromosomal instability."

https://openalex.org/W2038498610,"Cyanobacteria are abundant throughout most of the world's water bodies and contribute significantly to global primary productivity through oxygenic photosynthesis. This reaction is catalysed by two membrane-bound protein complexes, photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII), which both contain chlorophyll-binding subunits functioning as an internal antenna1. In addition, phycobilisomes act as peripheral antenna systems, but no additional light-harvesting systems have been found under normal growth conditions. Iron deficiency, which is often the limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth in aquatic ecosystems2, leads to the induction of additional proteins such as IsiA (ref. 3). Although IsiA has been implicated in chlorophyll storage, energy absorption and protection against excessive light, its precise molecular function and association to other proteins is unknown. Here we report the purification of a specific PSI–IsiA supercomplex, which is abundant under conditions of iron limitation. Electron microscopy shows that this supercomplex consists of trimeric PSI surrounded by a closed ring of 18 IsiA proteins binding around 180 chlorophyll molecules. We provide a structural characterization of an additional chlorophyll-containing, membrane-integral antenna in a cyanobacterial photosystem."

https://openalex.org/W2054244366,"The mammalian BAF complex regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. In this report, we identify 80 genes activated and 2 genes repressed by the BAF complex in SW-13 cells. We find that prior binding of NFI/CTF to the NFI/CTF binding site in CSF1 promoter is required for the recruitment of the BAF complex and the BAF-dependent activation of the promoter. Furthermore, the activation of the CSF1 promoter requires Z-DNA-forming sequences that are converted to Z-DNA structure upon activation by the BAF complex. The BAF complex facilitates Z-DNA formation in a nucleosomal template in vitro. We propose a model in which the BAF complex promotes Z-DNA formation which, in turn, stabilizes the open chromatin structure at the CSF1 promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2144706906,"Here, we report the identification of a new E1A binding protein complex that is essential for E1A-mediated transformation. Its core component is a SWI2/SNF2-related, 400 kDa protein (p400). Other components include the myc- and p/CAF-associated cofactor, TRRAP/PAF400, the DNA helicases TAP54alpha/beta, actin-like proteins, and the human homolog of the Drosophila Enhancer of Polycomb protein. An E1A mutant, defective in p400 binding, is also defective in transformation. Certain p400 fragments partially rescued this phenotype, underscoring the role of E1A-p400 complex formation in the E1A transforming process. Furthermore, E1A and c-myc each alter the subunit composition of p400 complexes, implying that physiological p400 complex formation contributes to transformation suppression."

https://openalex.org/W2142611898,"A hypomorphic mutation made in the ORC2 gene of a human cancer cell line through homologous recombination decreased Orc2 protein levels by 90%. The G1 phase of the cell cycle was prolonged, but there was no effect on the utilization of either the c-Myc or beta-globin cellular origins of replication. Cells carrying this mutation failed to support the replication of a plasmid bearing the oriP replicator of Epstein Barr virus (EBV), and this defect was rescued by reintroduction of Orc2. Orc2 specifically associates with oriP in cells, most likely through its interaction with EBNA1. Geminin, an inhibitor of the mammalian replication initiation complex, inhibits replication from oriP. Therefore, ORC and the human replication initiation apparatus is required for replication from a viral origin of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2039096622,"The prostaglandin H synthases (PGHS) catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, the committed step in prostanoid synthesis. Two forms of PGHS exist, PGHS-1 (COX-1) and PGHS-2 (COX-2). The gene encoding the latter form is known to be inducible by a number of stimuli including several inflammatory mediators. Recent evidence indicates that the inducible cyclooxygenase may have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties through the generation of different prostaglandins. Previous reports indicate that the transcription factor NF-κB can function upstream ofCOX-2to control transcription of this gene and that the cyclopentenone prostaglandins can inhibit NF-κB activation via the inhibition of the IκB kinase. Thus, it is suggested that cyclopentenones feed back to inhibit continued nuclear accumulation of NF-κB. In this report we demonstrate COX-2 expression inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and we confirm that the cyclopentenone prostaglandins inhibit NF-κB. In addition, we show that prostaglandin E2 and its analogs promote the inherent transcriptional activity of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB in a manner independent of induced nuclear accumulation. Consistent with this evidence, prostaglandin E2 strongly synergizes with the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α to promote NF-κB-dependent transcription and gene expression. The data provide a molecular rationale to explain both the pro- and anti-inflammatory nature of COX-2.

PGHS-1 and -2 catalyze both a cyclooxygenase reaction in which arachidonate is converted to PGG2 and a peroxidase reaction in which PGG2 is reduced to prostaglandin H (PGH2). Subsequently, PGH2 is converted to the key prostanoids PGE2, PGF2, PGI2, PGD2, and thromboxane A2. PGD2 can also be converted into cyclopentenone prostaglandins, namely PGJ2 (1Davies P. Bailey P.J. Goldenberg M.M. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 335-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These prostanoids have a diverse array of effects on cellular processes, such as affecting vascular permeability, inducing hyperalgesia, and driving T helper and B cell differentiation (1Davies P. Bailey P.J. Goldenberg M.M. Ford-Hutchinson A.W. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 335-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However prostaglandins do not always act in a similar or coordinate manner. For example PGI2 inhibits platelet aggregation, whereas thromboxane A2 increases it (3Wu K.K. Thiagarajan P. Annu. Rev. Med. 1996; 47: 315-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Therefore, the net effect of PGs may depend on their balance or timing within a tissue or during a physiological response. Whereas PGHS-1 is constitutively expressed, PGHS-2 is inducibly expressed in most mammalian cells. This expression occurs rapidly following stimulation by cytokines, growth factors, and bacterial endotoxin (4Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar, 5Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). PGHS-2 plays a major role in inflammatory processes, and its expression has been correlated with several diseases associated with inflammation and with colon cancer (6Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J.

FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). In addition to its pro-inflammatory aspects, PGHS-2 has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, Gilroy, et al. (12Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) showed in a carrageenin-induced pleurisy model in rats that PGHS-2 protein peaked at 2 h which was associated with maximal PGE2 synthesis and increasing inflammation. However, at a later time point, PGHS-2 exhibited a second increase that was associated with reduced PGE2 synthesis but with increased levels of PGD2 and PGJ2 and with decreased inflammation. PGHS inhibitors reversed this trend, inhibiting inflammation at the early time point but enhancing inflammation later. These data indicate that the PGE2 type prostaglandins are associated with pro-inflammatory mechanisms, whereas the PGD2 and PGJ2 forms are associated with suppression of inflammation. The transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to be important in inflammation, suppression of apoptosis, and in cell proliferation (13Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar,14Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). In addition, NF-κB has been shown to control the induced transcription of the PGHS-2 gene (15Schmedtje Jr., J.F. Ji Y.S. Liu W.L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 16Jobin C. Morteau O. Han D.S. Balfour Sartor R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The prototypical member of the NF-κB family is a heterodimer consisting of p65/RelA and p50/NF-κB1. Both subunits contribute to DNA binding, but only the p65 subunit has transactivation domains capable of initiating transcription. The NF-κB heterodimer is typically localized to the cytoplasm by the inhibitory protein, IκB. Upon stimulation of the cell, such as with TNF-α, IκB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded. This allows the free NF-κB to accumulate in the nucleus where it can activate transcription. In the nucleus NF-κB can regulate the expression of many genes involved in inflammation such as ICAM-1, IL-2, IL-8, and complement factors (13Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5579) Google Scholar). In fact, strong evidence indicates that chronic dysregulation of NF-κB may underlie most inflammatory diseases and contribute to oncogenesis (17Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar, 18Baldwin A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Although most research has focused on the induction in NF-κB activity caused by increased nuclear levels of NF-κB, there is evidence that the transcription function of NF-κB can be enhanced without increasing nuclear levels of the NF-κB subunits. For example, an early report indicated that protein kinase C could stimulate the function of the transactivation domain of p65, leading to enhanced NF-κB function (19Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, phosphorylation of p65 has been shown to increase transcriptional activity of NF-κB (20Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol.

Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, some inhibitors of NF-κB activity function without affecting induced nuclear accumulation (24Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). These data indicate that dual controls exist for NF-κB, with one pathway functioning to increase nuclear levels of NF-κB while another controls inherent transactivation potential. As mentioned previously (25Dumais N. Barbeau B. Olivier M. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27306-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Castrillo A.

Additionally, recent evidence indicates that PGHS-2 activity may also affect NF-κB. This could lead to a positive or negative feedback control mechanism dependent on whether PGHS-2 has a positive or negative effect on NF-κB activity. Since PGHS-2 has anti- and pro-inflammatory functions, we were interested in testing whether these distinct processes could be due to the opposing actions of PGHS-2 and its effectors on NF-κB activation. By controlling NF-κB activity, PGHS-2 and prostaglandins could self-regulate PGHS-2 expression and ultimately control other NF-κB-dependent inflammatory genes. In the current study, we used the immortalized colorectal cell lines, Caco-2 and HT-29, in order to determine if the expression of PGHS-2 and the action of prostaglandins could regulate NF-κB activity. We have found that PGHS-2 and its different effector prostaglandins can up-regulate or down-regulate NF-κB function through distinct regulatory mechanisms. HT-29 human colon epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC HTB 38)) were grown in McCoy's 5A growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells (ATCC HTB 37) were grown in minimal essential medium-α mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Both Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were used during an early passage (<10 passages). Prostaglandins were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). 16,16-Dimethylprostaglandins were utilized for their enhanced stability as recommended by the supplier. 16,16-Dimethyl-PGE2 binds EP receptors similarly to PGE2 (29Kiriyama M.

A mammalian expression vector for human cyclooxygenase-2 under control of the CMV promoter was kindly provided by Timothy Hla (Center for Vascular Biology, University of Connecticut). An expression vector encoding the NF-κB p65 subunit has been described previously (30Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

For the analyses pcDNA 3.1 from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) was used as vector control. Recombinant adenovirus (either control or encoding the “super-repressor” form of IκB) was prepared by the University of North Carolina Gene Therapy Center. The NF-κB-responsive luciferase construct contains three tandem repeats of the κB site from the class I MHC enhancer cloned into a luciferase expression vector (32Cheshire J.L. Williams B.R.

If required, cells were transfected the next day as described below. Cells were then treated as described with TNF-α (10 ng/ml)(Promega, Madison, WI), diclofenac (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan), or prostaglandins for 24 h or as described. After treatment, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped from the plates, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and lysed on ice in 1 pellet volume of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.3 µg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Nuclei were pelleted, and cytoplasmic supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes. Nuclei were washed once in cytoplasmic extraction buffer lacking Nonidet P-40 and then repelleted. Nuclear pellets were resuspended by vortexing in 1 pellet volume of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.3 µg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). All cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were spun and transferred to fresh tubes. Glycerol was added to cytoplasmic extracts to a final concentration of 20%. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad catalog number 500-0006), and extracts were stored at −70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (32Cheshire J.L. Williams B.R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4801-4806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of nuclear extract protein were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled NF-κB probe containing a κB site from a murine MHC I promoter. Reactions were carried out in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.7, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 2 µg of poly(dI·dC)(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Complexes were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in Tris glycine/EDTA buffer (25 mm Tris, 190 mmglycine, and 1 mm EDTA). After completion of the run gels were dried and autoradiographed. Caco-2 cells were transiently transfected using Fugene transfection reagent from Roche Molecular Biochemicals as described by the manufacturer. Cells were transfected 24 h after being plated. Transfections for EMSAs were carried out in 100-mm tissue culture plates, whereas transfections of luciferase assays were carried out in either 6- or 12-well dishes. For cultures prepared in 100-mm, 6-well, and 12-well dishes, 12, 1, and 0.25 µg of DNA were transfected, respectively. Caco-2 cells were also transfected with a peGFP-C1 expression vector from CLONTECH in order to evaluate the transfection efficiency. Over 80% of transfected cells expressed GFP by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were transfected using Fugene as described above. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and treated with various prostaglandins, TNF-α, diclofenac, or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). 16 h after treatment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed at room temperature for 10 min with shaking using M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent from Pierce. Cell were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and spun at maximum speed for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined as described above. 100 µg of protein was analyzed using a luminometer as described previously (34Cogswell P.C. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells were plated on 100-mm dishes. The next day cells were washed with PBS and treated with media containing 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, both or neither for various time points. mRNA was obtained using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) RNeasy mRNA preparation kit. IL-8 cDNA was used with Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) Quikhyb hybridization solution. Gene Hunter (Nashville, TN) loading dye containing ethidium bromide allowed us to verify efficient osmotic transfer from gel to blot. Adenoviral infections were performed with Ad-LacZ or Ad-IκB-Super-repressor as described previously (35Wang C.Y. Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Based on earlier reports of the effects of different prostaglandins on NF-κB nuclear levels (i.e. inhibition by cyclopentenones and accumulation of nuclear NF-κB by PGE2; see Refs. 24Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar and 26Castrillo A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. Hortelano S. Martin-Sanz P. Bosca L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1692-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), we examined whether PGHS-2 activity could affect NF-κB activity. The transformed colorectal cell line HT-29 constitutively expresses an active prostaglandin H synthase 2 (36Parker J. Kaplon M.K. Alvarez C.J. Krishnaswamy G. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we determined whether NF-κB signaling could be altered by inhibiting PGHS-2 activity in HT-29 cells. We performed an EMSA on nuclear extracts of HT-29 cells (Fig.1), which had been treated with either TNF-α (2nd to 5th lanes), or a PGHS inhibitor diclofenac (7th to 10th lanes), or both reagents (12th to 15th lanes). As expected TNF-α was able to stimulate nuclear translocation of NF-κB in HT-29 cells. The PGHS inhibitor diclofenac alone did not have any significant effect on the nuclear localization of NF-κB (Fig. 1). In contrast, when diclofenac and TNF-α were simultaneously added to the HT-29 cells, increased levels of NF-κB nuclear translocation were observed from 4 h onward relative to TNF-α treatment alone. This result indicates that the ability of TNF-α to induce NF-κB activation can be enhanced when the function of the two PGHS isoenzymes is inhibited and that PGHS functions to feed back and limit NF-κB activation. It is known that TNF-α can up-regulate COX-2 expression in HT-29 cells by activating NF-κB activity (16Jobin C. Morteau O. Han D.S. Balfour Sartor R. Immunology. 1998; 95: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that the induction of COX-2 in response to TNF-α signaling leads to a negative feedback response to block NF-κB nuclear accumulation. In order to understand further the role of PGHS-2 in the regulation of NF-κB activation, we next performed transient transfection experiments using a PGHS-2 expression vector. The colorectal cell line Caco-2 expresses PGHS-2 at relatively low levels and can be transfected at high efficiency (37Tsujii M. Kawano S. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity has not been studied previously in cells overexpressing COX-2. Therefore, we studied the effect of overexpressing PGHS-2 on the induction of NF-κB activity in this cell line. As expected, TNF-α was able to induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB in cells transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 1). Cells transfected with increasing levels of a PGHS-2 expression vector exhibited decreased nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). The result described above indicated that the constitutive expression of PGHS-2 could negatively regulate NF-κB activation. This response could occur through several mechanisms. Reports indicating that PGHS-2 contains perinuclear localization and integral membrane domains provide speculation regarding prostaglandin-independent mechanisms of PGHS-2 function (38Spencer A.G. Woods J.W. Arakawa T. Singer I.I. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9886-9893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 39Morita I. Schindler M. Regier M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10902-10908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). However, we focused our attention on the products of the PGHS-2 enzyme, namely prostaglandins. Prostaglandins are essential to inflammation and have also been implicated in altered cell growth in some cancer models (40Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although there are three classes of prostanoids, namely prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins, we focused on the role of prostaglandins in our analysis. Various prostaglandins were assessed for their ability to activate or repress an NF-κB-dependent promoter. A luciferase reporter construct containing three tandem repeats of the κB site from the class I MHC enhancer cloned into a luciferase expression vector was transiently transfected into Caco-2 cells. After 24 h, cells were treated with complete medium containing various prostaglandins. TNF-α was used as a positive control for NF-κB activation. 16 h after treatment a luciferase assay was performed. We observed a 3–5-fold increase in promoter activity after TNF-α treatment (Fig. 2). Me2SO alone, which was the solvent used to dissolve prostaglandins, gave no significant change in reporter activity (Fig. 2). In order to draw comparisons between experiments, prostaglandin activity is represented relative to TNF-α-induced activation. Different prostaglandins were able to both enhance or inhibit NF-κB activity. Prostaglandin E2 and its analogs, which bind the EP receptor family, were able to activate NF-κB (Fig.2). The most effective NF-κB activators were 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 and sulprostone, both of which are PGE2 analogs. 16,16-Dimethyl-PGE2 and sulprostone increased promoter activity 2- and 3-fold, respectively, which represents a 70 and 127% increase relative to TNF-α stimulation. Even at the lowest concentrations (1 µm) of 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 tested, we continued to observe increased promoter activity (data not shown). Since increases in luciferase indicate enhanced transcriptional activity of NF-κB, this result indicates that PGE2 and its analogs can up-regulate the ability of NF-κB to stimulate gene expression. Although the EP receptor agonists were able to up-regulate NF-κB promoter activity, we also found several prostaglandins that down-regulated promoter activity. Since Caco-2 cells have a high basal level of NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity, prostaglandins could also be assessed for their ability to suppress NF-κB activity. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, 16,16-dimethyl-PGA1, and 16,16-dimethyl-PGA2all inhibited promoter activity (Fig. 2). The PGA analogs inhibited basal promoter activity by greater than 10-fold, whereas a 2-fold decrease was observed after 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 treatment. This represents a decrease of 47 and 95% over basal activity by 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 and PGA, respectively. Therefore, our results indicate that there are both stimulatory and inhibitory prostaglandins with respect to NF-κB activity. In order to examine the mechanism whereby PGE2 up-regulates NF-κB activity, we performed an EMSA of nuclear extracts from Caco-2 cells treated with PGE2. Another study had reported that PGE2 can lead to the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus of T cells (25Dumais N. Barbeau B. Olivier M. Tremblay M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27306-27314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); however, stimulation with PGE2 did not induce nuclear translocation of NF-κB in Caco-2 cells, whereas TNF-α did (Fig.3A). We also performed a Western blot of PGE2-treated Caco-2 cells in order to examine the levels of cellular inhibitor of NF-κB, IκBα. Although the expected degradation of IκBα after TNF-α treatment was clearly observed, PGE2 treatment did not lead to such degradation (data not shown). These data are consistent with a lack of induction of nuclear accumulation of NF-κB after PGE2treatment. Although increases in NF-κB transcriptional activation are typically associated with increasing nuclear levels, recent reports suggest that alternative pathways exist by which NF-κB transcriptional function can be enhanced. For example, the phosphorylation of the p65 transactivation domain at serine 529 has been shown to be important for TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (20Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Additionally, coactivators, which are important for some of the functions of NF-κB, have been shown to be dependent on the phosphorylation of NF-κB (21Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used a Gal4 DNA-dependent reporter assay to examine the transcriptional activation of NF-κB independent of nuclear translocation. The Gal4-p65 construct contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain fused to the first transcriptional activation domain (TAD-1) of p65 (residues 521–551). Consequently, when the transcriptional activation mediated by p65 TAD-1 is increased, transcription of the luciferase gene driven by a promoter containing Gal4 DNA binding domains will be increased. Cells transiently cotransfected with the Gal4-Luciferase and Gal4-p65 (TAD) constructs were treated with either Me2SO or 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2. We observed a consistent 30% increase in fold activation after PGE2 treatment. Although the increase reflected a high luciferase response, the lack of a high fold activation is likely due to high basal levels of Gal4-p65(TAD) in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3B). Therefore, since it is known that Caco-2 cells express detectable levels of PGHS-2, we tested whether inhibiting PGHS-2 with diclofenac could decrease the basal Gal4-p65(TAD) activity (42Kamitani H. Geller M. Eling T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21569-21577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment with diclofenac decreased the high basal levels of Gal4-p65 (TAD) by over 50% but had no effect on a Gal4-VP16 construct (Fig. 3C). Consistent with these results, PGE2 stimulated expression of the Gal4-p65 reporter severalfold in WiDr cells, another colorectal cell line, which have lower basal levels of Gal4-p65 luciferase activity (data not shown). Since no increase in nuclear translocation of NF-κB after PGE2 treatment was observed despite an increase in transcriptional activation of p65, we tested whether prostaglandins could synergize with TNF-α to stimulate NF-κB activity. It was hypothesized that PGE2 could utilize enhanced levels of NF-κB to stimulate gene expression. Sulprostone treatment synergized with TNF-α to activate NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity in transfected Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4). Sulprostone and TNF-α together lead to a 2-fold activation compared with Me2SO and TNF-α. Because TNF-α/Me2SO leads to a 5-fold activation, this indicates that TNF-α/sulprostone caused a 10-fold activation over untreated cells. As expected from previo"

In Drosophila, Fz orients the asymmetric division of the sensory organ precursor cell (pI) along the antero-posterior axis of the notum. Planar polarization involves a remodeling of the apical-basal polarity of the pI cell. The Discs-large (Dlg) and Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) proteins accumulate at the anterior cortex, while Bazooka (Baz) relocalizes to the posterior cortex. Dlg interacts directly with Pins and regulates the localization of Pins and Baz. Pins acts with Fz to localize Baz posteriorly, but Baz is not required to localize Pins anteriorly. Finally, Baz and the Dlg/Pins complex are required for the asymmetric localization of Numb. Thus, the Dlg/Pins complex responds to Fz signaling to establish planar asymmetry in the pI cell."

Mosaicism, different forms of DUP25 within the same family, and absence of segregation of 15q24-26 markers with DUP25 and the psychiatric phenotypes suggest a non-Mendelian mechanism of disease-causing mutation.

We have isolated PHOR1 (photoperiod-responsive 1), which shows upregulated expression in induced leaves (SD). PHOR1 encodes an arm repeat protein with homology to the Drosophila segment polarity protein armadillo. Antisense inhibition of PHOR1 produces a semidwarf phenotype similar to that of GA-deficient plants, and the antisense lines show reduced GA responsiveness combined with a higher endogenous GA content than wild-type plants. Feedback regulation of GA biosynthetic genes is also altered in these lines. Conversely, transgenic lines overexpressing PHOR1 show an enhanced response to GA. GA application induces rapid migration of PHOR1-GFP protein to the nucleus. Thus, PHOR1 appears to be a general component of GA signaling pathways that relocalizes to the nucleus in the presence of GA."

We have demonstrated that SMN also interacts with fibrillarin, a highly conserved nucleolar protein that is associated with all Box C/D small nucleolar RNAs and functions in processing and modification of rRNA.

We show that the glycine/arginine-rich domain of fibrillarin is necessary and sufficient for SMN binding and that the region of SMN encoded by exon 3, including the Tudor domain, mediates the binding of fibrillarin. Tudor domain missense mutations, including one found in an SMA patient, impair the interaction between SMN and fibrillarin (as well as the common snRNP protein SmB).

Approximately two confluent, 10-cm HeLa cultures were used for each immunoprecipitation. Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) was added to nucleolar extract to a final concentration of 0.65%. IgG from the hybridoma cell line SP2/0 (courtesy of Serafin Pinol-Roma, Mount Sinai School of Medicine) and the monoclonal anti-fibrillarin antibody 72B9 (40Reimer G. Pollard K.M. Penning C.A. Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Busch H. Tan E.M. Arthritis & Rheum. 1987; 30: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were coupled to protein-A-Sepharose (Sigma) equilibrated in IP buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.65% Nonidet P-40). The coupled protein A-Sepharose was incubated with nucleolar extracts (or an equivalent amount of IP buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed 5 times for 5 min with 1 ml of cold IP buffer. Immunoblotting was carried out with the anti-SMN monoclonal antibody 7B10 (27Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) at 1:1000. Detection was by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length cDNA clones encoding Xenopusfibrillarin (37Lapeyre B.

Biol. 1990; 10: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and SMN (obtained in our two-hybrid screens) as well as human U1A (generously provided by Walther van Venrooij, University of Nijmegen) were subcloned into the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion expression vector, pZEX, in which the multiple cloning site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was modified to shift the reading frame. 2Z. Paroush, unpublished data. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (room temperature induction, 5 h, 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) and purified using glutathione-agarose (Pierce). His6-, GST-, and zz (two IgG-binding domains)-tagged human SMN constructs were prepared as described previously (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). His- and zz-tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+ chelation (Qiagen) and IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity chromatography, respectively. The SMN-Tudor construct 83/173 was a kind gift of Dr. Michael Sattler (see Ref. 41Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). SMN-Tudor 83/173 constructs with single amino acid replacements were generated by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned via NcoI/KpnI into a modified pET24d expression vector (Novagen) containing an N-terminal His6-GST tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (48Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Expression and purification was carried out as described (25Meister G. Buhler D. Laggerbauer B. Zobawa M. Lottspeich F. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 48Samarsky D.A. Fournier M.J. Singer R.H. Bertrand E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3747-3757Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In vitro translation was carried out using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, coupled in vitro transcription and translation kit (Promega), and [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Xenopus fibrillarin and SMN and human U1A were translated from an SP64TEN vector (42Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Science. 1994; 265: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that we re-engineered to include a His6, N-terminal fusion tag and a Kozak sequence. SmB and Sip1 were translated from pET vectors as described previously (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For binding assays involving two tagged recombinant proteins, E. coli cell pellets were resuspended in Ipp-250T (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), mixed, and sonicated. Extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 200 µl of glutathione-agarose (Pierce), 1–2 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed 5 times with 1 ml of Ipp-250T and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Adjustments based on Coomassie staining were made to obtain equivalent loading of tagged proteins. Co-purified proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SMN monoclonal antibody 7B10. For binding assays with in vitro translated proteins, similar amounts (based on Coomassie staining) of GST (or zz-)-tagged proteins were coupled to the appropriate resin equilibrated in Ipp-250T. In vitro translated proteins were added (1–3 µl) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in a final volume of 500 µl. Following five 1-ml washes with Ipp-250T, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and analyzed by fluorography. The data shown in Fig. 6 were quantitated by densitometric scanning of three separate experiments using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S multi-imager with Quantity 1 software. Yeast two-hybrid screens were performed to identify proteins that interact with the core Box C/D snoRNP protein fibrillarin. Separate screens were performed with full-lengthXenopus fibrillarin against a Xenopus laevis and a human (HeLa) cDNA. The screen of the Xenopus library resulted in isolation of 7 SMN clones from a bank of 4.8 × 106 transformants. These clones all coded for either full-length Xenopus SMN or a protein lacking only the first 10 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of Xenopus SMN isolated in our screen is shown in Fig.1B. When Xenopusfibrillarin was used to screen a human (HeLa cell) cDNA library, the human SMN gene was isolated 21 times among the 1.49 × 107 transformants screened. Reporter gene activation was only observed for strains containing both the fibrillarin (XFib-BD) and SMN (Xenopus XSMN-AD or human HSMN-AD) constructs (Fig.1A); the fibrillarin or SMN constructs alone did not activate reporter gene expression (Fig. 1A). The reciprocal two-hybrid interaction has also been detected using full-length human SMN in a two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library (34Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The interaction of fibrillarin and SMN in the yeast two-hybrid system suggested the possibility that the proteins interact directly or indirectly in vivo. We have investigated whether fibrillarin interacts with SMN in vivoin co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HeLa cell extracts. Nuclear extracts enriched in nucleolar material were prepared from HeLa cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that essentially 100% of cellular fibrillarin and ∼5% of cellular SMN were present in the nucleolar-enriched extracts (data not shown). The antibody 72B9 (40Reimer G. Pollard K.M. Penning C.A. Ochs R.L. Lischwe M.A. Busch H. Tan E.M. Arthritis & Rheum. 1987; 30: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) was used to immunoprecipitate fibrillarin from HeLa cell extracts. Co-precipitation of SMN was assessed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 7B10 against SMN (27Hannus S. Buhler D. Romano M. Seraphin B. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SMN was co-immunoprecipitated from the HeLa extracts by the anti-fibrillarin antibody (Fig.2A) showing that fibrillarin and SMN exist together in a complex in vivo. A mock immunoprecipitation performed without HeLa extract reveals that the other bands are contributed by the antibody (Fig. 2A). Non-immune IgG (SP2/0) failed to co-immunoprecipitate SMN (Fig.2A). These results demonstrate that fibrillarin and SMN are associated in vivo in HeLa cells. To determine whether fibrillarin and SMN interact directly or indirectly (i.e. as parts of a complex bridged by other components), the interaction of recombinant fibrillarin and SMN was tested in vitro. Recombinant proteins were expressed inE. coli; extracts were mixed; GST-tagged fibrillarin was purified; and co-purification of recombinant SMN was analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody 7B10. SMN specifically co-purified with GST-tagged fibrillarin but not with glutathione-agarose, GST tag alone, or GST-U1A (U1 snRNA-binding protein) (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the interaction between fibrillarin and SMN is direct and is not mediated by other eukaryotic protein components. The strength and specificity of the interaction between SMN and fibrillarin were further characterized using tagged recombinant proteins andin vitro translated 35S-labeled proteins. GST-tagged SMN (either Xenopus or human SMN, results were not distinguishable) or GST-tagged fibrillarin were expressed inE. coli and coupled to glutathione-agarose. The protein-coupled beads were incubated with in vitrotranslated 35S-labeled proteins and washed extensively. Bound labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The fibrillarin/SMN interaction occurred in a reciprocal manner, with GST-tagged SMN specifically binding fibrillarin, and GST-tagged fibrillarin specifically binding SMN (Fig. 3A). GST-tagged SMN interacted with itself, the snRNP-protein SmB, and SIP1/Gemin2, as demonstrated previously (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 34Liu Q. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3555-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 35Liu Q. Fischer U. Wang F.

Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), but not with GST tag alone or the U1-binding protein U1A (Fig. 3A and data not shown). We show here that fibrillarin also self-associates (as suggested previously (16Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar)) but did not interact with GST tag alone, SmB, SIP1/Gemin2, or the U1A protein (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Approximately equivalent amounts of GST-tagged proteins were used in these assays, as judged by Coomassie-stained gels (Fig.3A). To characterize further the interaction between SMN and fibrillarin, the assay was carried out in the presence of increasing salt concentrations (Fig. 3B). The interaction between tagged SMN and in vitro translated fibrillarin was observed in the presence of up to 1 m NaCl. Similarly, the interaction between GST-tagged fibrillarin and in vitro translated SMN was stable to 1 m NaCl washes (data not shown). These results indicate that hydrophobic interactions are important for the association of fibrillarin and SMN. Eukaryotic fibrillarin consists of two major domains (Fig.4A). The glycine/arginine-rich (GAR) domain consists of ∼83 amino acids at the N terminus ofXenopus fibrillarin. Based on x-ray structural data and sequence conservation, the rest of the protein (amino acids 83–323) is similar to known SAM-dependent methyltransferases (15Niewmierzycka A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 814-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 16Wang H. Boisvert D. Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine the domains of fibrillarin that mediate its interaction with SMN, four GST-tagged fibrillarin truncation mutants (Fig.4A) were expressed in E. coli, coupled to glutathione-agarose, and incubated with full-length, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled SMN. Binding was assessed following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Deletion of the GAR domain of fibrillarin resulted in a loss of SMN binding (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the GAR domain alone interacted with SMN to an extent similar to full-length fibrillarin (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the GAR domain of fibrillarin is both necessary and sufficient for association with SMN in vitro. To elucidate the domain of SMN responsible for its interaction with fibrillarin, we tested eight truncation mutants of SMN (Fig.5A). Full-length, in vitro translated fibrillarin was incubated with each of the tagged SMN truncation mutants. It was recently shown that the conserved YG box of SMN (encoded by exons VI and VII) mediates the interaction of SMN with other proteins rich in glycine and arginine (Sm and Lsm proteins) and that the interaction is disrupted by a point mutation found in some SMA patients, Y272C (36Pellizzoni L. Charroux B. Dreyfuss G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11167-11172Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 44Friesen W.J. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26370-26375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal half of SMN including the YG box (159/294) failed to interact with fibrillarin (as did this same region containing the Y272C point mutation) (Fig.5B). On the other hand, the N-terminal half of SMN (1/160) supported interaction with fibrillarin comparable to that observed with full-length SMN (Fig. 5B). Fibrillarin failed to associate with fragments consisting of only the first 30 or 60 amino acids of SMN (1/30 and 1/60), but some binding of fibrillarin was observed with amino acids 1–90 of SMN (1/90, Fig. 5B). Fibrillarin binding comparable to that observed with full-length SMN was found with amino acids 90–294 or 90–160 of SMN (90/294and 90/160, Fig. 5B). Comparable amounts of the SMN truncation mutants were used in the binding assays (Fig.5B). Our results indicate that fibrillarin binding is mediated by amino acids 60–160 of SMN (encoded by exons IIb and III), with amino acids 90–160, comprising the Tudor domain (45Mushegian A.R. Bassett Jr., D.E. Boguski M.S. Bork P. Koonin E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 46Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 51-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), being of primary importance for the interaction. The Tudor domain of SMN has also been found to interact with specific Sm proteins (common components of snRNPs) (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Recently, the NMR structure of the Tudor domain of SMN and its association with Sm proteins have been characterized (41Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Based upon the NMR structural analysis, we generated 9 missense mutations in the Tudor domain of SMN (amino acids 83–173, Fig. 1B), and we tested their effect on association with fibrillarin. We found that amino acids Glu-104, Asp-105, Gln-136, and Leu-142 are important for fibrillarin association with the Tudor domain of SMN (Fig.6A). Mutation of these residues (E104K, D105K, Q136A, and L142A) reduced binding by 70–80%. Alteration of other amino acids within or near the Tudor domain binding pocket (Lys-97, Arg-133, Glu-135, Asn-137, and Ser-143) did not significantly alter fibrillarin binding (Fig. 6A). The same pattern of sensitivity to the mutations was observed for interaction of the Tudor domain with the core snRNP protein SmB, although the degree of the effects was greater for SmB binding than for fibrillarin (Fig.6A). Our results indicate that SMN interacts with core components of snoRNPs and snRNPs via similar mechanisms involving the Tudor domain. Spinal muscular atrophy is correlated with deletions and/or mutations within the SMN1 gene (22Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P.

One point mutation found in SMA patients, E134K, maps to the Tudor domain of SMN and was shown to abolish binding to Sm proteins in vitro (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2351-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Selenko P. Sprangers R. Stier G. Buhler D. Fischer U. Sattler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of E134K on the interaction of the N-terminal half of SMN (1/160) with fibrillarin, and we found that the mutation decreased binding by ∼50% (Fig. 6B). As expected, the SmB protein also failed to interact efficiently with the E134K mutant (Fig.6B). The effect of the SMA-associated E134K point mutation on interaction with fibrillarin reveals a potential link between snoRNP biogenesis or function and spinal muscular atrophy. In this work, we have identified and characterized an interaction between the core Box C/D snoRNP protein fibrillarin and the spinal muscular atrophy-linked protein SMN. This finding is of potential importance to our understanding of snoRNP biogenesis as well as the etiology of spinal muscular atrophy. SMN interacts with fundamental components of multiple nuclear RNA-protein complexes as follows: spliceosomal snRNPs (23Buhler D. Raker V. Luhrmann R. Fischer U. Hum. Mol.

We studied the mechanism of 15-LOX-1 induction in A549 lung epithelial cells and found that genistein, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, prevented phopsphorylation of STAT6, its binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter, and the expression of catalytically active enzyme. In contrast, cycloheximide did not prevent 15-LOX-1 induction. Surprisingly, we found that IL-4 up-regulated the histone acetyltransferase activity of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, which is responsible for acetylation of nuclear histones and STAT6. The acetylation of both proteins appears to be essential for the IL-4-induced signal transduction cascade, because inhibition of CBP/p300 by the viral wild-type E1A oncoprotein abrogated acetylation of both histones and STAT6 and strongly suppressed transcriptional activation of the 15-LOX-1 gene. Moreover, we found that the inhibition by sodium butyrate of histone deacetylases, which apparently suppress 15-LOX-1 gene transcription, synergistically enhanced the IL-4-stimulated 15-LOX-1 expression. These data suggest that both phosphorylation and acetylation of STAT6 as well as acetylation of nuclear histones are involved in transcriptional activation of the 15-LOX-1 gene, although these reactions follow differential kinetics. STAT6 phosphorylation proceeds within the first hour of IL-4 stimulation. In contrast, CBP/p300-mediated acetylation requires 9–11 h, and similar kinetics were observed for the expression of the active enzyme. Thus, our results suggest that in the absence of IL-4, nuclear histones may be bound to regulatory elements of the 15-LOX-1 gene, preventing its transcription. IL-4 stimulation causes rapid phosphorylation of STAT6, but its binding to the promoter appears to be prevented by nonacetylated histones. After 9–11 h, when histones become acetylated, STAT6 binding sites may be demasked so that the phosphorylated and acetylated transcription factor can bind to activate gene transcription.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that IL-4 also induces the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and transcription of theCD36 gene (18Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). IL-4 binding to its cell surface receptor leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular part of the IL-4 receptor and to an activation of Janus kinases 1 and 3 (19Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). These kinases may be involved in phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) (19Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation, STAT6 dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, where it may bind to a particular sequence elements (20Mikita T. Campbell D. Wu P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) in the promoter of IL-4-responsible genes. The involvement of STAT6 in IL-4-induced 15-LOX-1 expression was underlined by the fact that no induction of 12/15-LOX-1 activity was observed in macrophages from homozygous STAT6-deficient mice (21Heydeck D. Thomas L. Schnurr K. Trebus F. Thierfelder W.E. Ihle J.N. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the detailed mechanism by which STAT6 acts as a transcriptional activator is far from clear. Mutagenesis studies suggested that the biological activity of the transcription factor requires an intact carboxyl terminus (22Lu B. Reichel M. Fisher D.A. Smith J.F. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1255-1264PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several STAT proteins are known to recruit coactivators possessing histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity for the stimulation of gene expression (23Imhof A. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nakatani Y. Wolffe A.P. Ge H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 689-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 24Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). For instance, STAT6 was shown to interact with the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and an associated protein, named p300, which exhibit HAT activity (25McDonald C. Reich N.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This interaction required an intact carboxyl-terminal region of STAT6 (26Gingras S. Simard J. Groner B. Pfitzner E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2722-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the mechanism of IL-4-induced expression of the 15-LOX-1 gene in A549 cells and found that acetylation of histone proteins and STAT6 is required for transcriptional activation of this particular gene. From our data, it may be concluded that the acetylation of histones, which block STAT6 binding at the 15-LOX-1 promoter if they are present as nonacetylated proteins, enables promoter binding of phosphorylated and acetylated STAT6, which in turn may lead to transcriptional activation of the 15-LOX gene. A549 cells (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Recombinant IL-4 (human) was purchased from Biomol Research Laboratory (Hamburg, Germany). Anti-STAT6 and anti-acetyl antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-histone H3 and anti-acetylhistone H3 were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-15-LOX-1 antibody was purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Genistein, cycloheximide, and sodium butyrate were supplied by Sigma. Immunoprecipitations were performed by incubating the nuclear extracts with 2 μg of the primary antibody for 1 h, and the immune complexes were bound to protein A-agarose. The beads were then washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) along with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and pepstatin as protease inhibitors), and the immune complex was released by SDS sample buffer. After separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), they were transferred onto Immobilon nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore) by semi-dry blotting. The membranes were then probed with various antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the detection of acetyl-STAT6 among abundantly present acetylhistone proteins a double immunoprecipitation strategy was used. The first immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-acetylhistone H3 antibody. Subsequently, proteins were extracted with elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3) from the immunoprecipitate and subjected to a second immunoprecipitation in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer using anti-STAT6 antibody. The so obtained immunoprecipitate was electrophoresed, blotted on a nylon membrane, and probed with an antibody raised against acetylated proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). This anti-acetyl antibody apparently exhibits higher affinity for acetyl-STAT6 than for acetylhistone H3, giving a more intense band of acetyl-STAT6 than that of acetylhistone H3. Formaldehyde was added to the IL-4-treated cells at a final concentration of 1% and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested. The soluble chromatin was prepared according to the method of Dignam et al. (27Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar) and sonicated at maximal power for 30 s twice to shear the genomic DNA. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-histone, anti-acetylhistone, and anti-STAT6 antibodies. Cross-linking was reversed in the immunoprecipitate complexes by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 200 mm and incubation at 65 °C for 6 h. The DNA was purified by proteinase K treatment (150 μg/ml) for 1 h, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitation by ethanol. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was performed for the presence of the 15-LOX-1 promoter using specific primers. The extract aliquoted before the immunoprecipitations was used to prepare control input genomic DNA, which was also used for PCR analysis. For Western blotting, protein was directly denatured by electrophoresis sample buffer and applied to SDS-PAGE. Double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the STAT6 binding element, present at −963 base pairs counted from the start of transcription of the human 15-LOX-1 gene, was used as probe in the gel shift assays. The assays were performed with nuclear extracts from IL-4-treated cells as described previously (25McDonald C. Reich N.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 711-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was electrophoresed on 6% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Transfections were performed using Transfectase reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1.5 μg of each mammalian expression plasmid containing wild-type E1A oncoprotein (wtE1A) and a mutant for the CBP binding domain (E1AmCBP), which were kind gifts from Dr. A. Hecht, Freiburg, Germany, were cotransfected together with 0.1 μg of control plasmid PRSVLACZ to normalize for transfection efficiency. A titration was performed with varying amounts of wtE1A plasmid to determine the quantity of DNA required for maximal transfection efficiency. A 1-kilobase fragment of the 15-LOX-1 promoter proximal to the coding sequence was amplified by PCR. 100 pmol of this DNA were end-labeled with biotin 16-dUTP. The end-labeled DNA was purified and bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The beads were washed with PBS and incubated with the nuclear protein extracts and 10 μg of poly(dI-dC), a nonspecific competitor of DNA, in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with PBS, and proteins were eluted with buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The eluted protein was desalted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Silver staining was performed to visualize the proteins. Filter binding assays were performed as described (28Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Core histones were isolated from acid-solubilized nuclear proteins after trichloroacetic acid-acetone precipitation. 3.3 mg/ml histones were acetylated in a reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm proteinase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. [3H]Acetyl-CoA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 6 μg of protein extract for 30–60 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper (Upstate Biotechnology) and washed for 30 min with 0.2 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.2. The filter paper was dried and used for liquid scintillation counting. Similar experiments were performed using nonradioactive acetyl-CoA. The reaction mixture was denatured and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. The Western blot was probed with anti-acetylhistone H3 antibodies and developed using the ECL detection system. A549 cells were cocultured in the presence of 670 pm of IL-4 for 24 h. The cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. After addition of arachidonic acid (100 μm), the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 20 min. Reduction of hydroperoxy fatty acids to their corresponding hydroxy derivatives was achieved by the addition of a molar excess of sodium borohydride. The reaction mixture was acidified to pH 3.0, and lipids were extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. A defined amount of 13-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acid, which is absent in cells, was added as an internal standard before extraction. High performance liquid chromatography analysis was performed on a Supelco-SIL column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) using n-hexane/2-propanol/acetic acid (100:2:0.1 v/v/v) as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 13-hydroxyoctadecaenoic acid were detected and quantified at 235 nm. Similar experiments were performed with A549 cells transfected with wtE1A and E1AmCBP oncoproteins. A549 cells were cultured for various periods in the presence of 670 pm IL-4. The cells were harvested, and the lysates were analyzed for the expression of 15-LOX-1 mRNA by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using 15-LOX-1-specific primers. The highest mRNA concentration was detected after a 12-h incubation period (Fig. 1 A). After longer incubation periods, the mRNA levels dropped perceptibly. Similar kinetics were observed when the expression of the 15-LOX-1 protein was followed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). To find out whether IL-4 has to be present during the entire incubation period or whether a single cytokine stimulus may be sufficient to induce 15-LOX-1 expression, the following experiment was carried out. A549 cells were exposed to IL-4 for various periods, the cytokine was washed away, and incubation was resumed for a total of 24 h. Finally, the expression of 15-LOX-1 mRNA was analyzed by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1 B, 15-LOX-1 expression in A549 cells required a minimum of 11 h of continuous exposure to IL-4. These data indicate that a single IL-4 stimulus is not sufficient to up-regulate expression of the 15-LOX-1 mRNA. Moreover, it was concluded that the IL-4-induced intracellular signal transduction cascade leading to 15-LOX-1 expression is a time-requiring process and may involve yet unidentified regulatory elements (21Heydeck D. Thomas L. Schnurr K. Trebus F. Thierfelder W.E. Ihle J.N. Kuhn H. Blood. 1998; 92: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Roy B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To find out whether IL-4-induced 15-LOX-1 expression involves de novo synthesis of STAT6-dependent regulatory proteins, additional transcription factors, or both, experiments were carried out in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. As shown in Fig. 1 C, cycloheximide did not affect the activation of 15-LOX-1. Activation of cellular acetyltransferases may constitute an additional regulatory element in the intracellular signal transduction cascade (24Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Acetylation of histones causes conformational changes of nuclear proteins, leading to demasking of potential transcription factor binding sites, so that the transcription factor may bind to the promoter of target genes. Because histone acetylation has recently been implicated in the induction of 15-LOX-1 expression in CaCo-2 cells (31Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of IL-4 on HAT activity in our cellular model. For this purpose, cells were exposed to IL-4 (670 pm final concentration) for 3 h, and the cell lysates were assayed for HAT activity. We found that IL-4 significantly up-regulated HAT activity even after a relatively short incubation periods (Fig. 2). The HAT activity is the sum of several catalytic processes and involves the activity of various proteins. One of these enzymes is the transactivating protein CBP/p300, which exhibits strong HAT activity. To find out whether CBP/p300 is involved in IL-4-induced up-regulation of acetyltransferase activity in A549 cells, we transfected the cells with the viral oncoprotein wtE1A, which has been identified as an endogenous inhibitor of CBP/p300. After IL-4 treatment, the transfected cells exhibited significantly reduced HAT activity (Fig. 2). When different amounts of cDNA were transfected, the suppression was found to be dose-dependent (Fig. 2 B). However, this suppression of IL-4-induced HAT activity could be reversed by transfecting the cells with E1AmCBP, a mutant of E1A protein incapable of binding to CBP/p300. These data indicate that the augmented acetyltransferase activity is mainly due to activation of CBP/p300. The acetylation degree of nuclear histones depends on cellular HAT activity but also on the activity state of histone deacetylases (HDACs). In resting cells, there appears to be a steady state of acetylating and deacetylating events and inhibitors, or activators of either process may shift the equilibrium in either direction. Recently, it has been reported that activation of HDAC may cause alterations in the chromatin state and may inhibit gene transcription (30Kao H.-Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). If our working hypothesis (CBP/p300-catalyzed histone acetylation is important for IL-4 induced 15-LOX-1 expression) is true, inhibitors of cellular HDAC are likely to act synergistically to IL-4 or may even be capable of inducing 15-LOX-1 expression in the absence of IL-4. To test this conclusion, A549 cells were incubated with suboptimal doses (335 pm) of IL-4 in the presence of sodium butyrate, and the expression of 15-LOX was assayed by Western blotting. From Fig.3 it can be seen that IL-4 at suboptimal concentrations did not induce 15-LOX-1 expression. However, in the presence of sodium butyrate, a strong LOX signal was observed. Interestingly, sodium butyrate did also induce 15-LOX-1 expression in the absence of IL-4. Similar results have recently been reported for other cellular systems (31Kamitani H. Taniura S. Ikawa H. Watanabe T. Kelavkar U.P. Eling T.E. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Because histone acetylation may be important for binding of transcription factors to the promoter of the 15-LOX-1 gene, we carried out transcription factor binding assays in vitro. A549 cells were incubated with IL-4 for different periods; then nuclear extracts were prepared, and binding studies of nuclear proteins to the 15-LOX-1 promoter were performed. In cells that were cultured in the absence of IL-4, we did not detect any promoter-binding proteins (Fig. 4 A, first lane). In contrast, a variety of 15-LOX-1 promoter-binding proteins were present in the nucleus of IL-4-treated cells (Fig.4 A, second and third lanes). As expected, STAT6 was one of the major components, and its identity was confirmed by Western blots using commercially available anti-STAT6 antibodies and by EMSA (data not shown). Interestingly, the pattern of the binding proteins was very similar when cells were treated with IL-4 for 1 or 12 h (Fig. 4 A, second and third lanes). These data indicate that under in vitro conditions, the transcription factors including STAT6 are capable of binding to the immobilized 15-LOX-1 promoter and that 1 h incubation is sufficient for maximal in vitro binding. Combining these data (rapid in vitro binding) with the results shown in Fig.1 (delayed 15-LOX-1 expression), one may conclude that in vivo the binding of phosphorylated STAT6 may be prevented. Alternatively, coactivators exhibiting a prolonged time dependence may be required for transcriptional regulation of the 15-LOX-1 gene. It has been reported for other cell types that tyrosine phosphorylation is involved in IL-4- and IL-13-induced 15-LOX-1 expression (29Roy B. Cathcart M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32023-32029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the effect of genistein, a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor, on protein phosphorylation and on the binding activity of nuclear proteins to the 15-LOX-1 promoter. A549 cells were treated with genistein (25 μg/ml) for 30 min. After washing away the inhibitor, 670 pm IL-4 was added, and the cells were cultured for additional 12 h. Subsequently, the nuclear extracts were analyzed for the presence of 15-LOX-1 promoter-binding proteins. From Fig.4 A, fourth lane, it can be seen that genistein completely blocked the binding of proteins to the promoter. Surprisingly, genistein did also abrogate STAT6 acetylation (Fig. 4 B). These data suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation in A549 cells may be a prerequisite for STAT6 acetylation and STAT6 binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter. It is well known that IL-4-induced intracellular signal transduction cascade bifurcates in various cellular systems and may initiate the Janus kinase/STAT6 pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/protein kinase C route, or both (32Wery S. Letourneur M. Bertoglio J. Pierre J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8529-8532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 33Chuang L.M. Tai T.Y. Kahn R.C. Wu H.P. Lee S.C. Lin B.J. J. Biochem. 1996; 120: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 34Hirasawa N. Sato Y. Fujita Y. Ohuchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because we found that the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleamide and calphostin C failed to inhibit IL-4-induced 15-LOX-1 expression (data not shown), this pathway may not be relevant for the regulatory mechanism in A549 cells. These data confirm earlier observations in a different cellular model (35Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). From Fig. 4 it was concluded that under in vitro conditions, phosphorylated STAT6 is capable of binding to the 15-LOX-1 promoter. The next series of experiments were aimed at addressing the question of whether such a binding may actually occurin vivo. For this purpose, A549 cells were cultured in the presence of IL-4 for various periods, and DNA-binding proteins were cross-linked to the nucleic acid by formaldehyde treatment; then STAT6 was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and the cross-linked DNA was analyzed by PCR using 15-LOX-1 promoter-specific primers. We found that the earliest binding of STAT6 was detected after 11 h of IL-4 exposure (Fig. 5, upper row). These data were somewhat surprising, because both STAT6 phosphorylation and its in vitro binding were rapid processes. Thus, it was concluded that the binding of STAT6 to the 15-LOX-1 promoter in vivo was inhibited during early phases of the incubation period. Similar in vivo binding studies were performed using anti-histone H3 (Fig. 5, second row) and anti-acetylhistone H3 antibodies (Fig. 5, third row). Here we observed that nonacetylated histones are bound at the early phases of the induction process. In contrast, STAT6 and acetylated histones were bound exclusively at later stages. These data indicate an inverse correlation between the binding of nonacetylated histone and the activation of the 15-LOX-1 gene. At early time points when histones are bound to the promoter (Fig. 5), we did not observe any 15-LOX-1 expression (Fig. 1). In contrast, after long-term incubations (≥11 h), when we observed promoter binding of acetylated histones and STAT6, the 15-LOX-1 mRNA was also expressed. Immunoprecipitations were performed to obtain experimental evidence for a physical interaction between STAT6 and histones on IL-4 stimulation. To check for in vivo interaction, the cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde to cross-link the proteins, followed by immunoprecipitation in the protein extract, applying a dual immunoprecipitation strategy. After the first immunoprecipitation with the anti-acetylhistone H3 antibody, the protein"
https://openalex.org/W2046172352,"Fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (FGF-BP) 1 is a secreted protein that can bind fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) 1 and 2. These FGFs are typically stored on heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix in an inactive form, and it has been proposed that FGF-BP1 functions as a chaperone molecule that can mobilize locally stored FGF and present the growth factor to its tyrosine kinase receptor. FGF-BP1 is up-regulated in squamous cell, colon, and breast cancers and can act as an angiogenic switch during malignant progression of epithelial cells. For the present studies, we focused on FGF-1 and -2 and investigated interactions with recombinant human FGF-BP1 protein as well as effects on signal transduction, cell proliferation, and angiogenesis. We show that recombinant FGF-BP1 specifically binds FGF-2 and that this binding is inhibited by FGF-1, heparan sulfate, and heparinoids. Furthermore, FGF-BP1 enhances FGF-1- and FGF-2-dependent proliferation of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and FGF-2-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 phosphorylation. Finally, in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assay, FGF-BP1 synergizes with exogenously added FGF-2. We conclude that FGF-BP1 binds directly to FGF-1 and FGF-2 and positively modulates the biological activities of these growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1975431385,"Dendritic cells (DCs) have evolved to monitor the environment, detect pathogens, and trigger T cell activation, providing a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. In turn, many pathogens have evolved to exploit DC biology in their dissemination within the body, and/or to interfere with DC functions to block or delay their elimination by the host. In this review, we do not attempt to provide a detailed account of every aspect of the interaction between pathogens and DCs, but instead aim to highlight some of the recent developments and new themes emerging in this area. The mucosae of the airways and the gastrointestinal tract are continuously exposed to a myriad of antigens and microorganisms, only a limited number of which enter the body and cause disease. This is due in part to the fact that epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions, forming a barrier that impedes the paracellular movement of microbes and their metabolites. In the gut, entry of pathogenic microorganisms occurs mainly via M cells, which are concentrated in the follicle-associated epithelium overlying the Peyer's Patches (PPs). M cells are very selective and do not allow entry of all microorganisms. Thus, only pathogens and bacterial toxins that can exploit preexisting intracellular trafficking pathways or induce de novo mechanisms for their phagocytosis penetrate the gut epithelium via M cells (reviewed by Neutra 1999Neutra M.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 236: 17-32PubMed Google Scholar). DCs and macrophages are located in intraepithelial pockets below the M cells: incoming pathogens are thus delivered directly to DCs. An additional mechanism by which DCs can monitor the contents of the intestinal lumen was recently described (Rescigno et al. 2001Rescigno M. Urbano M. Valzasina B. Francolini M. Rotta G. Bonasio R. Granucci F. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). DCs send dendrites outside the epithelium, like periscopes. The integrity of the epithelial barrier is preserved, however, as the DCs express tight-junction proteins and form new tight-junction-like structures with neighboring epithelial cells (Figure 1). It is not clear whether this mechanism is constitutively active or induced in response to signals from epithelial cells that have been in contact with pathogens or high numbers of nonpathogenic bacteria in the lumen. An inducible mechanism is suggested by the observations that DCs are recruited to the lamina propria of the small intestine after bacterial infection, and the number of DCs recruited depends on the pathogenicity of the microorganisms encountered. In line with this, it has been shown that bacterial components such as flagellin can be transcytosed across the epithelium and can induce the release of proinflammatory mediators and chemotactic factors. Although both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria can release flagellin, only invasive pathogens allow its efficient transcytosis (Gewirtz et al. 2001Gewirtz A.T. Simon Jr., P.O. Schmitt C.K. Taylor L.J. Hagedorn C.H. O'Brien A.D. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This would suggest that pathogens could facilitate entrance of otherwise noninvasive microbes via this route. It is likely that some sexually transmitted pathogens may also enter the host in the absence of damage to the local epithelial cell barrier via one or another of the routes for antigen sampling at mucosal surfaces. For example, atraumatic application of simian immunodeficiency virus to the tonsils of macaques resulted in virus uptake and replication close to the antigen-transporting epithelium of the tonsillar crypts (Stahl-Hennig et al. 1999Stahl-Hennig C. Steinman R.M. Tenner-Racz K. Pope M. Stolote N. Matz-Rensing K. Grobschupff G. Raschdorff B. Hunsmann G. Racz P. Science. 1999; 285: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the virus accessed this site was not defined. However, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) can be captured and transported in an infectious form by DCs after binding to a DC C-type lectin highly expressed on DCs in mucosal tissues, DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), raising the possibility that virus may have been captured by DC processes outside the epithelium and carried across the epithelial barrier. Local tissue trauma could enhance infection, both by introducing breaches into the epithelial barrier and also because the associated inflammatory signals may promote local DC-mediated virus uptake. Transmission of some infections is known to involve breaching of the epithelium. For example, pathogens spread by arthropod vectors are delivered across this barrier. Recent studies of the initial events in infection with two unrelated mosquito-borne viruses, dengue virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEE), suggest that Langerhans cells are the first site of replication of both viruses. Thus, DCs are located at epithelial sites throughout the body, and contact pathogens during the very early stages of infection. In some cases, this may be exploited by pathogens to facilitate their entry and initial replication. Infection stimulates the release of a variety of soluble factors, including chemokines, which promote the recruitment of DC precursors, and cytokines that are powerful mediators of DC activation. DCs themselves are also important producers of type 1 interferons (IFNs), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), which can act in an autocrine fashion to promote DC activation. In humans, a small population of cells in the blood which produce particularly high levels of IFN-α during virus infections have been identified as plasmacytoid DCs. In addition, pathogens or their components can activate DCs directly. There is emerging evidence that two different classes of receptors are important for microorganism handling by DCs, one that is involved in microorganism internalization, and another that activates DCs. These may be differentially localized, with some of the DC activation receptors being retained in phagosomes where they can sample the contents and define the nature of the internalized microbes. Pathogen recognition is achieved by means of receptors specific for invariable structures of microorganisms. The best characterized of these are the Toll-like receptors (TLR), which are expressed on multiple cell types including DCs, macrophages, and epithelial cells. TLRs cooperate to transduce cellular activation and cytokine production by activating members of NF-κB transcription factor family (reviewed by Kaisho and Akira 2001Kaisho T. Akira S. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 78-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Examples include TLR9, which is triggered by CpG motifs characteristic of bacterial DNA, and TLR5 that mediates immune responses to flagellin from Gram-positive and -negative bacteria (Hayashi et al. 2001Hayashi F. Smith K.D. Ozinsky A. Hawn T.R. Yi E.C. Goodlett D.R. Eng J.K. Akira S. Underhill D.M. Aderem A. Nature. 2001; 410: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). Viruses and their components can also directly activate DCs. For example, addition of dsRNA to DCs in vitro promotes their activation, perhaps after binding to an as yet unidentified cellular receptor analogous to TLR9. Likewise, infection of immature human DCs with influenza virus induces DC activation and stimulates IL-12 production, driving T cell polarization toward the production of TH1-type cytokines (Cella et al. 1999Cella M. Salio M. Sakakibara Y. Langen H. Julkunen I. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Infection of DCs with recombinant adenoviruses also promotes initial DC activation, and synergizes with CD40 triggering to render DCs fully mature. The ability of certain viruses to stimulate DC activation and maturation directly likely accounts for the lack of requirement for CD4 help (via CD40-CD40L interactions) for the induction of virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses to these infections. DCs have the capacity to process exogenous antigens for presentation not only on MHC class II, but also on MHC class I molecules. Recent work has identified several mechanisms by which DCs can acquire and process exogenous microbial antigens for MHC class I presentation. For example, virions, including noninfectious viral particles, may bind to viral entry receptors on the DC surface and be internalized via a fusion-dependent mechanism, leading to direct presentation of virion antigens on MHC class I in the absence of viral replication/protein synthesis. Pathogens or their antigens can also reach the class I pathway after binding to DC surface receptors, including C-type lectins and, following antibody binding, Fc receptors. In addition to direct presentation of microbial antigens on MHC class I by microbe-laden DCs, DCs that are not themselves infected can present pathogen-derived antigens taken up from neighboring, pathogen-infected cells, either DCs or other cell types. This is termed indirect or cross-presentation. Immature DCs can acquire antigen from live cells via a contact-dependent mechanism that leads to transfer of plasma membrane plus intracellular proteins. DCs also readily capture viral and bacterial antigens from dead and dying cells by phagocytosing apoptotic cells or bodies, and by taking up heat shock proteins that may be loaded with antigenic peptides (reviewed by Larsson et al. 2001Larsson M. Fonteneau J.F. Bhardwaj N. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This cross presentation is essential to allow induction of CD8+ T cell responses to pathogens that do not infect DCs. It also provides a mechanism by which CD8+ T cell responses can be initiated to pathogens that trigger apoptotic death of DCs, inhibit DC maturation, or otherwise impair their function (discussed below). One of the important properties of DCs is their migratory capacity. However, during some infections, this may have a detrimental as well as a beneficial side: migration of pathogen-laden DCs from the periphery into lymph nodes not only serves to activate T cells, but may also contribute to the dissemination of infection within the host. For example, studies in a murine model of VEE infection have shown that Langerhans cells in the skin are the first cells infected with the virus and carry it into the draining lymph nodes, which plays an essential role in viral pathogenesis (MacDonald and Johnston 2000MacDonald G.H. Johnston R.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). HIV-1 uses a novel mechanism to exploit DC migration and interaction with T cells to further its replication and spread. As mentioned earlier, HIV-1 virions can bind to a DC-specific lectin, DC-SIGN. This does not lead to viral entry into DCs, but efficiently captures the virus and retains it in an infectious state, allowing transport of the virus to lymphoid tissues where it promotes infection in trans of CD4+ T cells (Geijtenbeek et al. 2000Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Kwon D.S. Torensma R. van Vliet S.J. van Duijnhoven G.C.F. Middel J. Cornelissen I.L.M.H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. KewalRamani V.N. Littman D.R. et al.Cell. 2000; 100: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). HIV-exposed DCs can thus transport HIV to lymph nodes and transmit a vigorous infection to CD4+ T cells in the absence of viral replication in the DCs themselves. The destiny of microbial-loaded DCs from mucosal surfaces remains an open question, but is one that is important to understand in terms of both immunity and pathogen spread. Microbes that have entered the body via M cells are delivered directly to DCs present in the subepithelial dome of the PPs. It is unclear whether PP-DCs migrate out of the PPs to the mesenteric lymph node or to the spleen, or if they migrate into interfollicular regions of PPs. PPs have a higher number of B cells compared to other organized lymphoid tissues, and may be responsible primarily for mucosal immune responses. By contrast, microbes that are unable to penetrate M cells, such as noninvasive Salmonella, have been shown to reach the spleen, presumably carried by the DCs that have captured them across mucosal surfaces. Different types of immune response are required to mediate control of different pathogens. For example, intracellular pathogens often require a cell-mediated or TH1-type response, whereas TH2-dominated responses are frequently necessary to eliminate extracellular pathogens. The nature of the DCs stimulating a T cell response plays an important role in directing the type of T cell response induced. In the mouse, the CD8α+ subset of DCs in lymphoid tissues is a major source of IL-12p70, a key cytokine for the development of TH1 cells, and mediates induction of CD8+ T cell responses via cross-priming. This DC subset has been described only in lymphoid organs. It may differentiate from a DC subset that migrates into lymphoid tissues after antigen capture, or may acquire microbial antigens directly in situ, either in a soluble form or as a package delivered by other DCs migrating from the periphery. However, isolated CD8α+ and CD8α− DCs are both good activators of T cell responses and CD8α− DCs have also been shown to induce TH1 responses, in the absence of IL-12; the specific roles of these DC subsets in immunity to intracellular pathogens thus remain unclear. The type of T cell response stimulated by DCs is, in turn, dictated by infection-associated signals that influence the activation and maturation of DCs. Pathogen components could act directly on DCs. In Drosophila, for instance, two members of the TLR family, Toll and 18-wheeler, induce the secretion of either antifungal or antibactericidal peptides, respectively. Likewise, Candida albicans yeasts but not hyphae activate DCs for IL-12 production and priming of TH1 cells. However, DCs are also indirectly affected by the impact that infection has on other cell types in the surrounding environment. In particular, the innate immune response is thought to have a major influence on DCs. In this way, DCs provide a link between the innate and adaptive immune systems. For example, type 1 IFNs, which are produced in response to virus infection, play an important role in the early inhibition of virus replication and enhance humoral immunity and switching to antibody isotypes associated with virus neutralization via a DC-dependent mechanism (Le Bon et al. 2001Le Bon A. Schiavoni G. D'Agostino G. Gresser I. Belardelli F. Tough D.F. Immunity. 2001; 14: 461-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Many pathogen immune evasion strategies are aimed at impairing recognition of infected cells or providing resistance to immune effector mechanisms (reviewed by Tortorella et al. 2000Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, Maksymowych and Kane 2000Maksymowych W.P. Kane K.P. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have revealed that pathogen evasion strategies may also be targeted at the induction/regulation of the immune response, via interfering with DC biology. As illustrated in Figure 2, many different steps in the DC “lifecycle,” from their initial generation to the productive interaction of mature DCs with T cells in lymphoid tissues, may be affected. Pathogens may reduce the number of immature DCs available to detect and trigger a response to infection by several means. They may reduce the number of DC precursors, or interfere with their differentiation into DCs. For example, human T cell leukaemia virus type 1 can infect monocytes and impair their differentiation into immature DCs. In addition, pathogens may impede the recruitment of DCs from the blood to sites of infection. As reviewed by Tortorella et al. 2000Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, a number of poxviruses and herpesviruses encode secreted chemokine receptor homologs which, by “mopping up” locally produced chemokines, may impair the influx of DC precursors into infected tissues. Alternatively, pathogens may induce destruction of DCs at the site of infection. Many viruses are able to infect immature DCs, and in some cases their replication within these cells may lead to apoptotic cell death. For example, canarypox infection results in a rapid apoptotic death of immature DCs, and vaccinia virus induces a more delayed apoptosis. Likewise, a number of bacteria can induce apoptotic cell death by interfering with intracellular pathways controlling apoptosis. For instance, Shigella and Salmonella spp. use the Type III protein secretion system to deliver effectors that activate proapoptotic proteins such as caspase 1 directly into the cell cytoplasm. Pathogens may also impair the acquisition and processing of antigens by DCs. Many pathogens have strategies for interfering with antigen processing and presentation within infected cells, including infected DCs. However, as uninfected DCs can cross-prime pathogen-specific immune responses, this may have little impact on the induction of the specific immune response. Perhaps a more effective mechanism by which pathogens may inhibit the functions of immature DCs is via interference with DC maturation. Some pathogens manage to avoid inducing DC activation/maturation. This is illustrated by the parasite Leishmania mexicana, which is ignored by DCs when it transforms into the noninfective amastigote form, contributing to persistence of the infection. Other pathogens possess mechanisms for inhibiting DC maturation. For example, in vitro infection of immature human DCs with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or vaccinia virus has been shown to inhibit their maturation (Salio et al. 1999Salio M. Cella M. Suter M. Lanzavecchia A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Engelmayer et al. 1999Engelmayer J. Marsson M. Subklewe M. Chahroudi A. Cox W.I. Steinman R.M. Bhardwaj N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6762-6768PubMed Google Scholar). HSV-1 may act intracellularly, targeting a signal transduction pathway involved in control of DC maturation. In contrast, vaccinia's inhibition of DC maturation is thought to be due at least in part to production of secreted proteins that bind to and inhibit the action of cytokines involved in DC maturation, such as type 1 IFNs and IL-1β. Similarly, parasites can interfere with DC maturation. For example, erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum modulate the maturation of DCs and their capacity to activate T cells (Urban et al. 1999Urban B.C. Ferguson D.J. Pain A. Willcox N. Plebanski M. Austyn J.M. Roberts D.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). By inhibiting the maturation of DCs, pathogens may also impair the ability of these cells to migrate from sites of antigen capture into the T cell areas of lymphoid tissues. Up-regulation of CCR7 is blocked in DCs infected with HSV-1, preventing the acquisition of responsiveness to chemokines that direct DC migration (Salio et al. 1999Salio M. Cella M. Suter M. Lanzavecchia A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Finally, pathogens may alter the interaction of DCs with T cells. Following infection with measles virus in vitro, human DCs mature, but they fail to support T cell stimulation. This may be attributed at least in part to a defect in CD40L-induced terminal DC differentiation and IL-12 release. However, the picture is more complicated, as interaction of measles virus glycoproteins with lymphocytes also delivers a dominant negative signal that leads to arrest of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, measles virus infection of DCs induces TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) expression, rendering the infected DCs cytotoxic for T cells with which they interact. Rauscher leukemia virus infection of murine bone marrow-derived DCs has also been shown to result in a failure of T cell activation associated with reduced IL-12 production together with an induction of IL-4 expression. This capacity to dysregulate cytokine production suggests the possibility that virus-induced abnormalities in the interaction between DCs and T cells may not just result in failure of induction of T cell activation, but might also lead to stimulation of an inappropriate type of T cell response. Similarly, the recent reports that immature DCs can prime regulatory T cells producing IL-10 raise the possibility that viral inhibition of DC maturation might lead to the induction of T cells that down-regulate the antiviral immune response, thus enhancing viral persistence. Many important features of DC biology have been revealed through study of their role in infections, such as the role of DCs in sampling the gut contents. Likewise, the study of DC biology has helped to elucidate some key aspects of microbial pathogenesis including the role of DC-SIGN in enhancing trans-infection of T cells by HIV-1, and to suggest strategies for induction of protective immune responses, e.g., novel mechanisms for delivery of antigens to DCs. Just as a reciprocal interaction between pathogens and DCs occurs during the course of an infection, the study of pathogen-DC interactions has been mutually beneficial for both immunologists and microbiologists."

Like other 4-aminofolate analogues, MTX exerts its toxicity by competitively inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, leading to intracellular depletion of tetrahydrofolate, impaired thymidylate, and de novo purine synthesis and inhibition of DNA replication (3Bertino J.R.

The major route for cellular uptake of MTX involves the reduced folate carrier (RFC), a bidirectional anion transporter with high affinity for reduced folates and antifolates but low affinity for folic acid (5Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Once inside the cell, MTX is modified by the addition of glutamyl groups in a process catalyzed by folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Polyglutamylation causes retention of MTX within the cell and increases the cytotoxicity of this drug by sustaining maximal inhibition of its target enzyme. Hydrolysis of MTX polyglutamates is catalyzed by the lysosomal enzyme, γ-glutamyl hydrolase (γ-GH), and favors drug efflux by one of several possible mechanisms (4Gorlick R. Goker E. Trippett T.

Young R. Olive M. Reeves Jr., W.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), suggesting that the mechanism causing MTX resistance may have occurred in vivo. We report that a CpG island in the promoter region of RFC is aberrantly methylated in MDA-MB-231 cells and enriched for deacetylated histones. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with the demethylating agent, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), induced re-expression of theRFC gene but did not in itself have a significant effect on MTX sensitivity, possibly due to the concomitant up-regulation of MTX-efflux mechanisms. Finally, we show that the effect of 5-aza-CdR on MTX uptake and MTX sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells can be modulated positively by dipyridamole (DPM) in a synergistic manner. Unlabeled MTX, 5-aza-CdR, DPM, and probenecid (PBCD) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. [3′,5′,7-3H]MTX (9 Ci/mmol; 97.3–99.6% purity (confirmed by thin-layer chromatography)) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Trichostatin A (TSA) was purchased from Wako. GeniticinTM (G418-Sulfate), LipofectAMINETM, and Opti-MEMTM were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The p5′ΔRFC and p5′ΔRFC-EGFP constructs (35Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. W. F. Flintoff (University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada). The p5′ΔRFC construct contains nucleotides +1 to +1937 of the human RFC cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). In the p5′ΔRFC-EGFP construct, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the RFC gene in p5′ΔRFC (35Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as monolayers in RPMI 1640 medium with Glutamax I (containing 2.3 µm folic acid; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (standard medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. MDA-MB-231 is an MTX-resistant cell line that does not express RFC mRNA (33Moscow J.A. Connolly T. Myers T.G. Cheng C.C. Paull K. Cowan K.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was established directly from the malignant pleural effusion of a patient who had received a single course of MTX-containing combination chemotherapy (34Cailleau R. Young R. Olive M. Reeves Jr., W.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1974; 53: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Cells (0.5 × 106) were seeded in T-25 tissue culture flasks (Nunc) in 5 ml of standard medium (day 0). At day 1, 5-aza-CdR was added at final concentrations from 0.05 to 1 µm. At day 3, TSA was added, where indicated, at a final concentration of 0.5 µm. At day 4, cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in standard medium, and used in further experiments. The effect of 5-aza-CdR treatment on gene expression is expected to last for at least 6 passages after termination of exposure (36Bender C.M. Pao M.M. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 95-101PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated using the Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra) and modified by sodium bisulfite under conditions that allowed the conversion of cytosine, but not 5-methylcytosine, to uracil (37Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA (2–3 µg) in a volume of 78 µl was denatured in 0.3n NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C followed by 5 min at 99 °C, and then cooled immediately on ice. One milliliter of a freshly prepared solution containing 4.2 m sodium metabisulfite (Sigma) and 0.5 mm hydroquinone (Sigma), pH 5.0, was added, and the samples were incubated under mineral oil at 55 °C for 16 h. Modified DNA was recovered using glassmilk from the Geneclean II Kit (BIO 101, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The reaction was completed by incubating the recovered DNA in 0.3 n NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was resuspended in DNA Hydration Solution (Gentra) and used immediately or stored at −80 °C until use. DNA treatedin vitro with SssI methyltransferase (New England Biolabs) was used as a positive control for methylated RFCalleles. The primer sequences and annealing temperatures are given in Table I. PCR amplifications were performed in 25-µl reactions containing standard PCR buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mmeach dNTP, 2 units of AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.2 mm cresol red, 12% (w/v) sucrose and bisulfite-modified DNA (∼50 ng). Reactions were initiated by “hot start,” followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, the appropriate annealing temperature for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 15 min. The products were resolved on 2% agarose gels.Table IOligonucleotides for methylation-specific PCR assaysGene (GenBank™ accession number)PositionSequence (5′–3′)Product sizeAnnealing temperaturebp°CRFC-U (U92868.1)1336CCAAATCACAAATACCAATAAAAAA111601446GGTTTTGTAAATTTTGGTTTGTRFC-M (U92868.1)1336CCGAATCGCAAATACCGATAAAAAACG111621446GGTTTTGTAAATTTCGGTTCGCFPGS-U (U24252.1)855AAACAAAACAATACTAATTAACAAAAAAAA14355997TAGGTGGTTTTGTGTTTGTFPGS-M (U24252.1)856AACGAAACGATACTAATTAACGAAAAAAA14160996AGGTGGTTTCGCGTTCGCMDR1-U (M29423.1)809ACTCTCTAAACCCACAAACAAT11758925GTTGGGGGTTTGGTAGTGTMDR1-M (M29423.1)810CTCTCTAAACCCGCGAACGAT11560924TTGGGGGTTTGGTAGCGCMRP3-U (AC004590)100997TTTTGTTTTATGGGTATATATTTGT17055101166AAAATCACATTCCTCTCCAAAAMRP3-M (AC004590)100997TTTCGTTTTACGGGTATATATTCGC17060101166AAAATCACGTTCCTCTCCGAAA Open table in a new tab Confluent cells in T-75 flasks were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C to cross-link DNA to chromatin-associated proteins, and then rinsed in ice-cold PBS, scraped, and collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-acetyl-H3 and anti-acetyl-H4 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology) was then carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The DNA-protein complexes were sonicated in a Branson Sonifier 250 under conditions that gave a range in DNA fragments from 200 to 1,000 base pairs, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used for G6PD promoter amplification were as described by Coffee et al. (38Coffee B. Zhang F. Warren S.T. Reines D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The primers used for RFC promoter amplification were 5′-AGCTTGCGCCAGGAATGCAG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCATCCTGGGGTGCCA-3′, which amplify a region from positions 832 to 1005, according to GenBankTM accession number U92868.1. For G6PDamplification using a block thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9600; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), reaction mixtures (25 µl) contained 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 1 unit of HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 1 × PCR buffer (Qiagen), 0.2 mm cresol red, 12% (w/v) sucrose, and immunoprecipitated DNA. Reactions were started by initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 37 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 67 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 15 min. For RFC amplification, the PCR conditions were as above, except that the reactions contained 1 × Q-solution (Qiagen), the number of cycles was 35, and the annealing temperature was 65 °C. PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels. For amplification on the LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), reaction mixtures (20 µl) contained 10 pmol of each primer, 4 mm (for G6PD) or 5 mm (forRFC) MgCl2, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (forG6PD), or 1 × Q-solution (Qiagen) (forRFC), and 1 × FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were started by initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 70 °C (for G6PD) or 72 °C (for RFC) for 15 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the Purescript RNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (2 µg) using random hexamers, oligo(dT) primers, and Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA concentrations were normalized for β-actin gene messages using the LightCycler system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers were 5′-TGAGATTGGCATGGCTTTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGTGCAATCAAAGTCCTCG-3′ (antisense), and the probes were 5′-AGGTGACAGCAGTCGGTTGGA-Fluorescein-3′ and 5′-LC-Red 640-CGAGCATCCCCCAAAGTTCA-phosphate-3′. Amplification was carried out in 20-µl volumes containing 10 pmol each primer, 4 pmol of each probe, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1 × FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Probes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 57 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. All other RT-PCRs were carried out using a block thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9600; PerkinElmer). The primer sequences, annealing temperatures, and numbers of PCR cycles are listed in Table II. The primer sequences for amplification of estrogen receptor α cDNA were as described (39Ferguson A.T. Lapidus R.G. Baylin S.B. Davidson N.E. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2279-2283PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA preparations were diluted 125-fold for amplification of GAPDH and 5-fold for amplification of γ-GH and dihydrofolate reductase. All reactions were performed in 25-µl mixtures containing 10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm each dNTP, 2 units of AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer), 1 × buffer (PerkinElmer), 0.2 mm cresol red, and 12% (w/v) sucrose. Hot start was performed after initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by the appropriate number of cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, the appropriate annealing temperature for 20 s, and 72 °C for 40 s, followed by incubation at 72 °C for 15 min.

G418-resistant transfectant clones isolated by limiting dilution were examined for RFC expression by RT-PCR and fluorescence microscopy (in the case of p5′ΔRFC-EGFP transfectants), for methylation status of the RFC gene by methylation-specific PCR, and for the presence of the Ki-ras codon 13 mutation (40Kozma S.C. Bogaard M.E. Buser K. Saurer S.M. Bos J.L. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (WAVE, Transgenomic), using previously described primers (41Nedergaard T. Guldberg P. Ralfkiaer E. Zeuthen J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells grown to semi-confluency in 24-well plates in standard medium were rinsed and left for 30 min in folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. This medium was then substituted with 0.5 ml of the same medium containing 1 µm[3H]MTX, and cells were kept at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. After varying intervals, the medium was removed and the monolayers were washed four times with ice-cold PBS. To determine MTX binding to the cells (42Flintoff W.F. Nagainis C.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), monolayers were incubated in the label-containing medium at 4 °C for 30 s and washed as above. For determination of initial influx rates in cell monolayers, cells were grown to semiconfluency on sterile 15-mm round coverslips (Thermanox) in 24-well plates. The coverslips were washed with folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium, incubated at 37 °C in medium containing 1 µm [3H]MTX for the indicated times (30 s to 10 min), and then washed four times by transferring the coverslips into ice-cold PBS. Samples were solubilized in 0.2 ml of a solution containing 2% Triton X-100 and 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature, and then neutralized by the addition of 0.2 ml of 0.1n HCl. Twenty microliters of each sample were withdrawn for protein determination, and the remainder was quantitatively transferred for measuring radioactivity by scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay, according to the procedure given by the manufacturer (Pierce). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. MTX uptake was determined as the difference between the radioactivity of samples incubated at 37 and 4 °C, and was expressed as picomole of MTX/mg of total cellular protein. Cells, grown to semi-confluency on coverslips in 24-well plates, were washed with folic acid-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in the same medium supplemented with 1 µm[3H]MTX. Then the coverslips were transferred into ice-cold PBS and washed by three successive changes of the buffer. Efflux was examined by placing MTX-loaded cell monolayers into preheated (37 °C) MTX-free medium. Efflux was terminated by transferring cells into ice-cold PBS. Values for nonspecific binding of [3H]MTX to coverslips preincubated in standard medium, incubated in MTX-loading medium and washed as above, were subtracted as background. When studying the effects of PBCD on efflux, PBCD (1 mm or 5 mm, with essentially the same result) was added to the MTX-loading medium during the last 10 min of the preloading period in order to provide access of PBCD in cisand trans orientation to the plasma membrane without compromising the loading procedure (7Sirotnak F.M. O'Leary D.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1412-1417PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux was measured as above in medium containing 1 mm PBCD. Protein concentrations were determined as described for MTX uptake. The initial MTX efflux rate was obtained as the slope from linear regression analysis of the efflux data and was expressed in femtomole of MTX/s/mg of protein. Quantitatively similar results were obtained when cells were plated directly in the wells of 24-well plates (not shown), but the use of coverslips resulted in a lower variation in the experimental data at short efflux intervals. For efflux rate constant determinations, the fraction of MTX remaining within the cells after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C was subtracted from the corresponding efflux data, and the logarithm of the percentage of the initial “free” MTX level was plotted as a function of time (43Zhao R.

Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 1000 cells/well in 0.1 ml of standard medium. Next day, serial dilutions of MTX (from 1 nm to 30 µm, final concentrations) were added to the wells in 0.1 ml of standard medium in the presence or absence of 10 µmDPM. After another 5 days, the amount of cells was evaluated by using the sulforhodamine-B (SRB) colorimetric cytotoxicity assay (44Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 150 µl of the medium were aspirated from each well, and plates were centrifuged for 3 min at 120 ×g. Then plates were placed on ice, and cells were fixed by adding 150 µl of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and incubating on ice for 1 h. The cells were then washed, dried, colored, and destained according to the original procedure (44Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). Bound SRB-dye was solubilized by shaking after the addition of 50 µl of 1m Tris base. The mixture was then further diluted by the addition of 100 µl of distilled water, the absorbance was measured at 490 and 550 nm, and data within the range of linearity, i.e.below absorbance 1.8 OD units (44Skehan P.

However, the molecular mechanism for HSC inactivation is not well understood. We investigated anN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC)-mediated signaling pathway involved in HSC inactivation. NAC, which acting through its reducing activity, induced cell arrest at G1 via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK)/MAPK pathway in a Ras-independent manner. The sustained activation of this extracellular signal-regulated kinase induced the expression of p21Cip1/WAF1, a cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor, and mediated cell growth arrest through the Sp1 transcription activator-dependent mechanism. These effects of NAC were all reversed by treatment of HSC with MEK inhibitor PD98059 followed by culturing HSC on type I collagen-coated flasks. The collagen-mediated suppression of NAC-induced arrest may be due to an overriding of the cell cycle arrest through an acceleration of integrin-induced cell growth. NAC action is actually dependent on modulating the redox states of cysteine residues of target proteins such as Raf-1, MEK, and ERK. In conclusion, an understanding of the NAC signaling pathway in HSC should provide the theoretical basis for clinical approaches using antioxidant therapies in liver fibrosis.

The activation of HSC is regulated by several factors including extracellular matrix, growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, oxidative stress, and other soluble factors (5Gressner A.M. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 6Pinzani M. Marra F. Carloni V. Liver. 1998; 18: 2-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recently, many reports have shown that the molecular mechanism for activation of HSC was involved in the intracellular signal cascade and transcriptional regulation of certain genes. For example, transforming growth factor-β1 induces activation of Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and MAPK in HSC (7Reimann T. Hempel U. Krautwald S. Axmann A. Scheibe R. Seidel D. Wenzel K.-W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mitogenic effect of platelet-derived growth factor in HSC requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (8Marra F. Gentilini A.

Laffi G. Gentilini P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition to these cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), and the products of lipid peroxidation have been shown to modulate gene expression and cell proliferation through involvement of c-myb and NF-κB and interaction of JNK in HSC (11Lee K.S. Buck M. Houglum K. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 12Parola M. Robino G. Marra F. Pinzani M. Bellomo G. Leonarduzzi G. Chiarugi P.

Furthermore, HSC activation by culture on plastic is associated with the activation of Sp1 and AP-1, which regulate the expression of collagen genes (13Rippe R.A. Almounajed G. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 1995; 22: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar, 14Armendariz-Borunda J. Simkevich C.P. Roy N. Raghow R. Kang A.H. Seyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some studies have focused on factors that may inhibit the proliferation of HSC and suppress activation of HSC. A nitric oxide-dependent increase in cellular cGMP levels has been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of lipopolysaccharides and interferon-γ on smooth muscle α-actin (SMA) expression in HSC (15Kawada N. Kuroki T. Uoya M. Inoue M. Kobayashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 238-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The proliferation of HSC is also inhibited by stimulation of cAMP-protein kinase and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase-II through the induction of CREB phosphorylation on Ser133 (16Houglum K. Lee K.S. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress has been implicated in hepatic fibrosis (6Pinzani M. Marra F. Carloni V.

In contrast, an antioxidant such as α-tocopherol blocks the activation of HSC induced by collagen type I matrix or transforming growth factor-α (11Lee K.S. Buck M. Houglum K. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2461-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and prevents iron-induced hepatic cirrhosis (20Pietrangel A. Gualdi R. Casalgrandi G. Montosi G. Ventura E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, effects of natural phenolic compounds such as resveratrol and quercetin on the functions of HSC were examined in a recently published study (21Kawada N. Seki S. Inoue M. Kuroki T. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that oxidative stress may enhance the activation of HSC, whereas antioxidants may suppress this process. However, the exact mechanism whereby antioxidants suppress the activation of HSC is still obscure. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an aminothiol and synthetic precursor of intracellular cysteine and GSH, has been used therapeutically in several disorders related to oxidative stress (22Cotgreave I.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 38: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The chemical properties of the cysteinyl thiol of NAC include its nucleophilicity and redox interactions, which provide antioxidant properties and thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. Recently, NAC has been found to have survival-promoting actions in PC12 cells (23Ferrari G. Yan C.Y.I. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2857-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other cell systems (24Mayer M. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7496-7500Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The NAC-promoted survival of PC12 cells has been reported to be independent of its antioxidant/radical scavenger property (25Yan C.Y.I. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, it has generally been assumed that the action of NAC is due to its antioxidant/radical scavenger properties or its thiol-disulfide exchange activity as a reductant. The present study was designed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of NAC action on the functions of cultured HSC. This report states that NAC acts as a reductant in cells due to its direct reducing activity, induces the sustained activation of ERK, up-regulates p21Cip1/WAF1 expression, and mediates cell cycle arrest through an Sp1-dependent mechanism. Collagen, collagenase H, Pronase, and trypsin were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nycodenz (5-(N-2,3-dihydroxypropyl-acetamido)-2,4,6-triido-N,N′-bis(2, 3-dihydroxypropyl)-isophthalamide) and anti-desmin, SMA, ERK, JNK, p38, and phosphoserine antibodies were from Sigma. Culture media and reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. [γ-32P]ATP and [methyl-3H]thymidine were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chromatography media were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies to phosphotyrosine, p21Cip1/WAF1, NF-κB p65, and c-Fos were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-CREB, Elk-1, Sp1, and phospho-ERK antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from commercial suppliers. HSC were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rats (400–500 g), which had free access to a standard laboratory chow diet. Nonparenchymal liver cells were isolated by the Pronase-collagenase method (26Alpini G. Phillips J.O. Vroman B. Larusso N.F. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 494-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and HSC were purified from the nonparenchymal cell suspension by a single step density gradient centrifugation with Nycodenz, as reported in detail by Schaferet al. (27Schafer S. Zerbe O. Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). HSC were identified by their typical light microscopy appearance and immunofluorescence staining for desmin (28Yokoi Y. Nahimisa T. Kuroda H. Komatsu I. Miyazaki A. Watanabe S. Usui K. Hepatology. 1984; 4: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The mean purity of freshly isolated cells as analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was 85 ± 5%, cell viability as checked with Trypan blue exclusion was 90 ± 5%, and the yield ranged from 12 to 20 × 106 cells/liver. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and maintained with DMEM containing 4 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml), and 5% fetal bovine serum, and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. The first change of the medium was made 16 h after seeding, after which the purity of the HSC was greater than 95%. The medium was changed every 24 h. Experimental manipulations were performed with cells at passages 5–12. Cultures were initiated at a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/ml, and NAC was added to the culture medium 24 h after starting the culture, unless otherwise mentioned. The concentration of intracellular GSH was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (BioxytechTM GSH-400; OXIS International, Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were homogenized in 500 µl of ice-cold 5% metaphosphoric acid and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 10 min. Supernatants were used to assay GSH using 4-chloro-1-methyl-7-trifluromethylquinolinium methylsulfate and 30% NaOH at 400 nm. Intracellular ROI production was measured by the method of Bae et al. (29Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Briefly, dishes treated with or without testing agents were washed with DMEM without phenol red and incubated in the dark for 5 min in the presence of 5 mmdichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). When dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate is oxidized within the cell, it becomes a highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein and can be detected (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm). Cell density in experimental cultures was measured by repeated counts with a hemacytometer. Viability was assessed by the exclusion of 0.2% trypan blue dye. A measurement of HSC activation was determined with the expression of SMA. At the end of cell culture, each plate was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with methanol. Specimens were incubated in PBS containing 1% albumin for 2 h, washed, and incubated with anti-SMA antibody in PBS containing 1% albumin at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 2 h. After being washed, samples were incubated with peroxidase substrate (o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride) and stopped with H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 490 nm. For cell cycle analysis, HSC were synchronized by serum starvation in a medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 h and induced to reenter the cell cycle by an exchange of 5% fetal bovine serum with/without 5 mm NAC. The distribution of cells in the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide-stained nuclei. A total of 1 × 106 cells were harvested at each indicated time and resuspended in 0.5 ml of propidium iodide solution (50 µg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml sodium citrate, 100 µg/ml RNase I, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Flow cytometric analysis was done with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Forward light scatter characteristics were used to exclude cell debris from the analysis. The G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase of the cell cycle were analyzed by diploid staining profiles and ModFit software programs (version 1.00 for Mac; ModFit Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). HSC grown in 100-mm plates were harvested at specified times after NAC treatment. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 µg/ml antipain). For immunoblotting, 20–50 µg of cell protein were separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (NOVEX) under reducing conditions, unless otherwise indicated, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the electroblotting technique. Membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine or ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies (3–5 µg) or preimmune serum for 12 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 µl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h on a roller system at 4 °C. Each bead was washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, with 1 ml of LiCl washing buffer (500 mmLiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT), and with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting using specific antibodies, and Raf-1, MEK, and ERK assay. Following the normalization of protein content, endogenous ERK or JNK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using monoclonal antibodies against ERK, JNK, or p38, as described previously (30Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 31Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase activity was assayed for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 µg of substrate, 50 µm ATP, and 3 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 40 µl of kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate). Myelin basic protein, glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun, and ATF-2 were used for assaying ERK, JNK, and p38 activity, respectively. After completion of kinase assays, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. For direct ERK kinase assay of Sp1 immunoprecipitates, Sp1 and ERK were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts using anti-Sp1 and ERK antibody, respectively, and then incubated with Protein A-Sepharose. After the beads were washed three times with washing buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mmNa2VO3, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmbenzamidine), Sp1 precipitates were mixed with ERK immunoprecipitates, and then a kinase reaction was carried out in the kinase buffer containing 5 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP of for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously but with modification (32Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). Extracts were prepared from 1–2 × 106 cells at specified times after an NAC treatment. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the plate with a cell lifter, and suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 2 µg/ml aprotinin, 2 µg/ml pepstatin, and 0.6% Nonidet P-40). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 20 min. Nuclei were sedimented at 1,200 × g for 5 min and washed once in buffer A. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then vigorously shaken. The soluble protein released by 30-min incubation on ice was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. The consensus sequences of transcription factors (AP-1, CREB, Elk-1, NF-κB, and Sp1) were as follows: AP-1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′/3′-GCGAACTACTCAGTCGGCCTT-5′; CREB, 5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′/3′-TCTCTAACGGACTGCAGTCTCTCGATC-5′; Elk-1, 5′-AGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′/3′-TCCTACAGGTATAATCCTGTAGA-5′; NF-κB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′/3′-TCAACTCCCCTGAAAGGGTCCG-5′; Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′/3′-TAAGCTAGCCCCGCCCCGCTCG-5′. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were annealed by heating to 95 °C and cooling to 25 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2 over a period of 1 h. Probes were end-labeled to 2–3 µCi/pmol of DNA with [γ-32P]ATP and 1 unit of T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 15 min. Nuclear extracts (5–10 µg of protein) were incubated in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.25 µg/ml poly(dI/dC)) at room temperature for 10 min and then supplemented with 5 × 104 cpm of32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe for 30 min. Nuclear protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA) and subjected to autoradiography. Tissue culture flasks were incubated with 20 µg/ml type I collagen (rat tail), type IV collagen (human placenta), fibronectin (human plasma), and laminin (mouse sarcoma) at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were incubated for 24 h and then treated with NAC for 24 h at 37 °C. Collagen-Sepharose conjugate was prepared from rat tail type I collagen and CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were treated with NAC for 6 h before solubilization by lysis buffer, and cell lysates were incubated with 50 µl of collagen-Sepharose conjugate and 20 µl of 1 mMgCl2 for 12 h at 4 °C The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and three times with 1 ml of PBS. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-integrin α1, α2, and β1antibodies and developed with ECL reagents. HSC grown in 100-mm plates were incubated with or without 5 mm NAC for 6 h. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and cell lysates were incubated with 50 µl of EZ-LinkTM PEO-iodoacetyl Biotin (10 mg/ml; Pierce) for 12 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 30 µl of UltraLinkTM Immobilized NeutrAvidinTM (Pierce) for 4 h on a roller system at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and three times with 1 ml of PBS. For Western blot analysis, proteins containing sulfhydryl groups were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Membranes were probed with anti-integrin α1/α2/β1, Ras, Raf-1, MEK, and ERK antibodies and developed with ECL reagents. First, we examined the role of antioxidants on the activation of HSC cultured in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum. HSC activation was assessed by SMA expression. As shown in Fig. 1A, NAC, GSH, DTT, β-mercaptoethanol, and diethyldithiocarbamic acid inhibited the activation of HSC in a dose-dependent manner, whereas other antioxidants such as Me2SO, mannitol, α-tocopherol, and trans-retinol did not affect the activation of HSC. Interestingly, most antioxidants suppressing the activation of HSC contain a sulfhydryl group. To assess whether the suppression of SMA expression in HSC by sulfhydryl antioxidants is due to growth inhibition or cell death, we performed a time course study of cell growth after treatment with each antioxidant. As shown in Fig.1B, the cell numbers of HSC cultured in NAC- and GSH-treated media are maintained at the level of an inoculated cell, whereas the cell numbers of HSC cultured in β-mercaptoethanol and diethyldithiocarbamic acid-treated media decrease below starting cell numbers. These data suggest that NAC and GSH induced cell arrest, whereas β-mercaptoethanol and diethyldithiocarbamic acid induced cell death. HSC grown in normal medium continued to proliferate until serum-starved, whereas cells grown in the presence of NAC underwent a dramatic and complete growth arrest up to 3 days. To determine whether the action of NAC in growth arrest is related to its antioxidant/radical scavenger properties via intracellular GSH or its reducing activity, we first treated HSC with buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO) in the presence of NAC, followed by GSH assay. BSO inhibits γ-glutamylcysteine synthase and causes the depletion of intracellular GSH (33Griffith O.W. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1205-1210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows that the NAC-mediated increase in intracellular levels of GSH was effectively inhibited by 1 mm BSO after 8 h of continuous exposure (Fig. 2A, inset). However, the proliferation analysis data in Fig. 2A show that, despite its inhibition of GSH accumulation, the BSO did not affect the capacity of NAC to arrest HSC. This result suggests that the action of NAC is independent of its effects on intracellular GSH. Furthermore, we show that the change in the intracellular level of ROI due to H2O2 did not affect the capacity of NAC to arrest cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, the treatment of the cells with NAC caused a decrease in fluorescence intensity as compared with the control treatment. When NAC-treated cells are added to H2O2 (250 µm), the fluorescence intensity of intracellular ROI in the cells is restored to the level of control, but the SMA expression of the cells is unchangeable. This suggests that the action of NAC is not dependent on its antioxidant/radical scavenger properties. Considering the fact that only antioxidants containing sulfhydryl group affect cell growth, NAC's reducing activity may be responsible for its action on cell arrest.Figure 2HSC-arresting action ofNACis independent of intracellular GSH and ROS levels.A, BSO inhibits the NAC-induced increase in GSH levels but has no effect on NAC-promoted cell arrest. HSC were incubated with BSO for 16 h prior to NAC treatment. Cells were treated with no additive (●), 1 mmBSO (○), 5 mm NAC (▾), and 1 mm BSO + 5 mm NAC (▿). At the indicated time after NAC treatments, cell lysates were prepared, and the levels of GSH were estimated (inset). Cell numbers represent the means ± S.E. of three separate experiments. B, despite a recovery of ROS production in NAC-treated cells by H2O2, NAC suppressed the SMA expression of HSC. Cells were cultured for 24 h with no additive (control), 5 mm NAC, or 5 mmNAC plus 0.25 mm H2O2. The cells were washed with DMEM without phenol red and incubated in the dark for 5 min in the presence of dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. ROS productions were determined with FL500 microplate fluorescence reader (Bio-Tek). The SMA expression of HSC was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further examine growth arrest, fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of DNA content was performed on proliferating and NAC-arrested cells. The cell cycle distribution of HSC was determined at various times after NAC treatment (0–36 h). In proliferating populations (control), the percentage of DNA content in S phase was 6.5% after 24 h. Following treatment with NAC for 24 h, this decreased to 0.4% (Table I). The data suggest that NAC prevents HSC entry into the S phase by arrest at the G1/S interphase.Table IInduction of growth arrest in HSC by NACTimeControlNACG0/G1SG2-MG0/G1SG2-Mh%%%%%%065.30.134.665.30.134.6662.12.535.465.41.033.61255.64.839.670.30.229.82446.46.552.972.40.427.23644.05.950.171.50.228.3Cells were synchronized by serum starvation in a medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 h and induced to reenter the cell cycle by an exchange of 5% FBS with/without 5 mm NAC. At the indicated time, the distribution of cells in the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide-stained nuclei. Open table in a new tab Cells were synchronized by serum starvation in a medium containing 0.1% serum for 24 h and induced to reenter the cell cycle by an exchange of 5% FBS with/without 5 mm NAC. At the indicated time, the distribution of cells in the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry using propidium iodide-stained nuclei. To investigate the role of the signal pathway in NAC-induced growth arrest, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin), protein kinase C (calphostin C), tyrosine kinase (herbimycin A), protein tyrosine phosphatase (Na2VO3), guanylate cyclase (LY83583), MEK (PD98059), and p38 (SB202190) on this process. Among various inhibitors, the addition of PD98059 to HSC cultured in the presence of NAC brought about a prominent reversal of NAC-induced suppression of SMA expression (Fig. 3). The data suggest that the MEK pathway plays a significant role in NAC-induced cell arrest. Marshall previously proposed that, when cells make a decision regarding proliferation versus differentiation, they do it by differences in the duration of ERK activation (34Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the kinase activity of ERK in NAC-treated HSC. Time course analyses showed that NAC affects ERK activity during the first 0.5 h, followed by a marked increase in ERK activity as measured at 3 h, and then a gradual decrease in the activity over a period of 24 h (Fig. 4A). Throughout, the level of ERK activation is maintained above control levels. In addition, activation of ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) requires the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues by MEK (35Rossomando A.J. Sanghera J.S. Marsden L.A. Weber M.J.

Therefore, we assessed the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in NAC-treated HSC by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with an anti-phosphorylated ER"

A recently identified family of multidomain proteins termed Src homology 3 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing (Shank), also known as proline-rich synapse-associated protein/somatostatin receptor-interacting protein, plays a central role in organizing the subsynaptic scaffold by interacting with several synaptic proteins including the glutamate receptors. We used the N-terminal ankyrin repeats of Shank1 and -3 to search for interacting proteins by yeast two-hybrid screening and by affinity chromatography. By cDNA sequencing and mass spectrometry the cytoskeletal protein α-fodrin was identified as an interacting molecule. The interaction was verified by pull-down assays and by coimmunoprecipitation experiments from transfected cells and brain extracts. Mapping of the interacting domains of α-fodrin revealed that the highly conserved spectrin repeat 21 is sufficient to bind to the ankyrin repeats. Both interacting partners are coexpressed widely in the rat brain and are colocalized in synapses of hippocampal cultures. Our data indicate that the Shank1 and -3 family members provide multiple independent connections between synaptic glutamate receptor complexes and the cytoskeleton.

The search for proteins that are localized at the PSD revealed a family of multidomain proteins termed proline-rich synapse-associated proteins 1 and 2 or somatostatin receptor-interacting protein.

Via synapse-associated protein-associated protein/guanylate kinase-associated protein, the PDZ domain of the Shank proteins is linked to the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-PSD-95 complex, whereas one of their proline-rich regions serves as a docking site for the metabotropic glutamate receptor-binding protein Homer (11Tu J.C. Xiao B. Naisbitt S. Yuan J.P. Petralia R.S. Brakeman P. Doan A. Aakalu V.K. Lanahan A.A. Sheng M. Worley P.F.

In addition, the SH3 domain has been proposed to interact indirectly with the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate-type glutamate receptor-interacting protein (14Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the Shank proteins act as a master scaffold for glutamate receptor complexes in postsynaptic specialization (14Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Firm contact of this scaffold with the cytoskeleton is then established via the interaction of another proline-rich region of Shanks and the SH3 domain of the F-actin-binding protein cortactin (8Du Y. Weed S.A. Wen-Cheng X. Marshall T.D. Parsons T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To date, little is known of potential protein candidates interacting with the N-terminally located ankyrin repeats of Shank1 and -3. First described by Breeden und Nasmyth (15Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1987; 329: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) in two yeast cell cycle regulator proteins (Swi6p and CDC10p), ankyrin repeats were named after repetitive units present in the ubiquitous adapter protein ankyrin (16Lux S.E. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and are known for their interaction with many diverse proteins (17Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Here we report on a novel interaction of the ankyrin repeats of Shank1 and -3 with a component of the membrane-associated cytoskeleton α-fodrin (also known as brain α-spectrin), another multidomain protein that contains 22 spectrin repeats, one SH3 domain, and two EF-hand motifs proximal to the C terminus of the protein (18Levine J.

Differentiation. 1987; 34: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the complexes consisting of α-fodrin and either Shank1 or Shank3 may represent a dynamic substructure of the synapse responsible for alterations of the functional architecture that occur during the organization and reorganization of spines and synapses in the central nervous system (21Engert F. Bonhoeffer T. Nature. 1999; 399: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 22Lüscher C. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Muller D. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). A cDNA fragment encompassing the ankyrin repeat region (six repeats) of human Shank1 was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which allows the expression of 6xHis-tagged fusion proteins. His6-Shank1189–399 was expressed inEscherichia coli strain TopF10′ and purified on Ni-chelating Sepharose (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA fragments coding for the C-terminal two spectrin repeats and the EF-hands of rat α-fodrin as well as the EF-hands alone were cloned into the pGEX4T-2 glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expression vector (AP Biotech, Freiburg, Germany); proteins were expressed in TopF10′ cells and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (AP Biotech). Affinity purification of His6-Shank1189–399-binding proteins followed a protocol essentially as described by Firestein and Bredt (23Firestein B.L. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10545-10550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After dialysis into 0.1 m NaHCO3and 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mg of purified protein were coupled to 5 ml of N-hydroxy-succinimidyl-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also coupled toN-hydroxy-succinimidyl-Sepharose (5 mg BSA/ml of Sepharose). Brains of 25 adult rats were homogenized in 200 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmEDTA, and four tablets of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the extract was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant fraction was applied to the BSA-Sepharose and incubated overnight. The BSA-resin was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was applied to either fresh BSA-Sepharose (10% of the sample) or His6-Shank1189–399-Sepharose (90% of the sample). After incubation for 3 h, unbound material was removed, and the Sepharose was washed extensively in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 only. Bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and 2.5 m urea, followed by a second elution step with 4 m urea in the same buffer. 20% trichloroacetic acid (0.66 volume) was added to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation, pellets were washed with ether/ethanol (1:1) and solubilized in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, including 1% SDS. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, bands of interest were excised, cut into small pieces, and rinsed exhaustively in water until the pH of the supernatant was neutral. The gel pieces were lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated with 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing trypsin (10% of the estimated protein content of the band). After digestion overnight at 37 °C, peptides were extracted with 10% trifluoroacetic acid, purified on Sep-Pak C-18 cartridges (Waters, Eschborn, Germany), and lyophilized. Samples were dissolved in water; 1 µl was applied on a fast evaporation nitrocellulose/α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid layer (24Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3281-3287Crossref Scopus (643) Google Scholar) and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Bruker Reflex mass spectrometer, reflector mode, pulsed-ion extraction). For protein identification, a data base search using the recorded peptide masses was performed with the program ProFound version 4.10.3 (www.proteometrics.com/). The following search parameters were used: data base NCBInr (2000/07/15), entries only from rat (Rattus norvegicus), full mass and pI range, maximum one missed cleavage, protease trypsin, monoisotopic masses M+H, and mass tolerance ±0.3 Da (external calibration only). A yeast-two-hybrid screen was performed using the Y190 yeast strain harboring the reporter genes HIS3 and β-galactosidase under the control of upstream GAL1-activating sequence. As a bait, the cDNA coding for the six ankyrin repeats of Shank3240–442 were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in vector pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). A rat brain cDNA library cloned into the pACT vector (GAL4 activation domain;CLONTECH) was screened. Putative protein-protein interactions in yeast were tested by the ability to activate both HIS3 and β-galactosidase gene transcription. To eliminate false-positive putative interaction partners, the library plasmids were cotransformed with various bait constructs, and afterward candidates were sequenced. To further determine the interaction domain of the initial α-fodrin prey clone, several partial cDNAs coding for one or a combination of different C-terminal α-fodrin domains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pACT2 vector. Protein-protein interactions in yeast were subsequently tested by the ability to activate both HIS3 and β-galactosidase gene transcription after retransformation in yeast expressing the Shank3240–442construct as a bait. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of α-fodrin fragments were expressed and purified; proteins were not eluted but left on the glutathione-Sepharose. 35 µg of His6-Shank1189–399 were added in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing in the same buffer, bound fusion proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting using an antiserum directed against the ankyrin repeat region of Shank1. COS cells were transfected with a Shank3 enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-SH3 domain (EGFP-Shank3536–610), an EGFP-ankyrin repeat construct (EGFP-Shank3240–442; pEGFP-vector;CLONTECH), C-terminal α-fodrin cDNA fragments carrying an N-terminal Flag epitope tag (pCMV2-vector; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and full-length α-fodrin carrying a C-terminal Flag epitope tag (kindly provided by Drs. J. Morrow and M. Stankewich, Yale University). Cells were grown on glass coverslips treated with poly-d-lysine, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and processed for immunofluorescence detection. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cotransfected with expression vectors containing a Shank1 fragment coding for the N-terminal Shank11–1288 (5Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the full-length α-fodrin vector. Cells were either processed for immunofluorescence analysis (using a rabbit anti-PDZ domain antibody for Shank1 and a mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody for the detection of α-fodrin, followed by Cy2-labeled anti-rabbit and Cy3-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibodies) or for immunoprecipitation. Membrane fractions from brain were solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by incubation on ice for 30 min (12Kreienkamp H.J.

Similarly, transfected HEK cells were solubilized in RIPA buffer (5Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Insoluble matter was removed by centrifugation at 20,800 ×g for 30 min, and the supernatant fractions were incubated with the anti-α-fodrin antibody (5 µg) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by incubation (overnight at 4 °C) with Protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For precipitation with a Shank3 antibody (directed against residues 980–1786 of rat Shank3), solubilization was performed with 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 50 mmEDTA. Extracts were incubated with 10 µl of antiserum overnight, followed by protein A/G-Sepharose treatment for 2 h. After washing the Sepharose beads extensively in lysis buffer, the immune complexes were eluted from the beads with Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 7% polyacrylamide gels, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The filters were probed with antibodies directed against the Shank1 PDZ domain (5Zitzer H. Hönck H.H. Bächner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Zitzer H. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18153-18156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the C-terminal 800 amino acids of Shank3 or α-fodrin. Bands were visualized by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (in the case of HEK cells) or by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (in the case of brain membranes). Hippocampal neuronal cultures from 18-day-old embryonic rats were prepared and grown on coverslips as described by Goslin and Banker (25Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 251-281Google Scholar), washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min, and blocked with 10% horse serum in PBS (0.01% Triton X-100) for 30 min. For double immunofluorescence, the primary cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-Shank3 (1:400) and mouse anti-α-fodrin antibodies (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA; 1:50) in 10% horse serum in PBS (0.91% Triton X-100). After three washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated for 3 h with goat anti-mouse Cy2 and goat anti-rabbit Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:150 in PBS. Photographs were taken using an Aristoplan photomicroscope (Leitz, Wetzlar, Germany) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS 4D; Leica, Bensheim, Germany). For immunohistochemistry (26Sternberger L.A. Hardy P.H. Cuculis J.J. Meyer H.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1970; 18: 315-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (4488) Google Scholar), rat brains were perfusion-fixed with Bouin's fluid and embedded in Paraplast (Sigma). Subsequently, 15-µm frontal and sagittal brain section were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and equilibrated in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, for 10 min. After preincubation with 5% normal swine serum in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min, the primary antibodies (Shank3, 1:1000; and α-fodrin, 1:100) were applied in preincubation buffer for 22 h at room temperature. Subsequently, sections were incubated with swine anti-rabbit (mouse) IgG (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) diluted 1:50 for 30 min and then with rabbit (mouse) peroxidase-antiperoxidase complex (Dako) diluted 1:100 for 30 min. Antibody binding was visualized by the application of 3,3-diaminobenzidine (0.05%) and H2O2 (0.001%; Sigma) for 6 min. After completion of the staining procedure, sections were dehydrated and mounted in DePeX (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). Rat brains from different developmental stages were frozen on dry ice in isopentan at −40 °C. The brains were cut with a cryostat in horizontal sections (18 µm), mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel, Braunschweig, Germany), and stored at −70 °C until used. Shank3 and α-fodrin mRNAs were detected with cDNA antisense oligonucleotides purchased from MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany): Shank3 (GenBankTMaccession number AJ133120), 5′-GTG-GCA-GGT-TCA-CAG-CGA-ATA-CCA-GCT-CTG-GCT-CCT-3′ (base pairs 4096–4060) and 5′-TCA-GGA-CTG-TGC-ACG-GGT-GTG-GGG-GAC-CGG-GAA-3′ (base pairs 3644–3612); and α-fodrin (GenBankTM accession number AF084186), 5′-GCG-GTG-GTA-CCG-ATC-CAG-AAC-CTG-CTG-TCG-TCT-3′ (base pairs 85–52). Hybridization was performed as previously described (7Boeckers T.M. Kreutz M.R. Winter C. Zuschratter W. Smalla K.H. Sanmarti-Vila L. Wex H. Langnaese K. Bockmann J. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6506-6518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a yeast-two-hybrid experiment, the ankyrin repeats of Shank3240–442 were used as bait to screen for potentially interacting proteins in a rat brain cDNA library. Of 1 × 106 clones, four positive candidates were obtained: three clones coded for rat amyloid precursor-like protein 1 and one clone for the C-terminal part of α-fodrin (amino acids 2019–2472; Fig. 1). The sequence starts in the middle of the 20th spectrin repeat, followed by spectrin repeats 21 and 22 and two EF-hand regions known to be common motifs of a superfamily of calcium-binding proteins; thus the clone lacks most of the spectrin repeats as well as the SH3 domain (20McMahon A.P. Giebelhaus D.H. Champion J.E. Bailes J.A. Lacey S. Carritt B. Henchman S.K. Moon R.T. Differentiation. 1987; 34: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To further map the region of α-fodrin interacting with the ankyrin repeats of Shank3, several α-fodrin prey constructs were designed, coding for one or a combination of the above-mentioned domains (named Fod1–Fod9; see Fig. 1). The yeast-two-hybrid assay revealed that spectrin repeat 21 alone (Fod1) displayed a strong interaction with the ankyrin repeats of Shank3, whereas the construct containing spectrin repeats 21 and 22 (Fod2) showed only a weak interaction, suggesting that the latter construct may not fold properly in the yeast. Alternatively, intramolecular interactions between different repeats may prevent accessibility of spectrin repeat 21 to the ankyrin repeats of Shank3. A strong interaction was also observed with Fod3 coding for spectrin 21 and 22 plus the first EF-hand motif (Fig. 1), whereas all other prey constructs lacked any interaction with the ankyrin repeats. In a parallel affinity chromatography experiment, a His6-tagged recombinant Shank1 protein containing the six N-terminally located ankyrin repeats (His6-Shank1189–399) was used as an affinity matrix to search for binding partners of the ankyrin domains of Shank1 in the rat brain (Fig. 2A, lane 1). After eluting the bound proteins from the His6-Shank1189–399-Sepharose beads, three major bands were visible on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A, lane 3). Two bands at 45 and 260 kDa were clearly enriched when compared with the supernatant fraction after preadsorption with BSA-Sepharose (lane 2); a third band at 50–55 kDa was also very abundant in the affinity-purified preparation but had about the same intensity as in the initial supernatant fraction (lane 2). These bands were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry using the mass fingerprinting technique as β-actin (45-kDa band), tubulin (50–55-kDa band), and α-fodrin (260-kDa band). A Western blot of the affinity-purified eluate incubated with an anti-α-fodrin antibody confirmed the presence of α-fodrin at 260 kDa and some of its major proteolytic breakdown products at 120 and 150 kDa (lane 5). To determine whether the binding between Shank1 and α-fodrin was direct or indirect via bound tubulin or actin, pull-down experiments were performed using recombinant fusion proteins of the interacting domains. When a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing spectrin repeats 21 and 22 including the EF-hand was coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, the His6-Shank1189–399 protein bound efficiently to these beads (Fig. 2 B), clearly demonstrating the direct interaction between the ankyrin repeats of Shank1 with α-fodrin. No binding was observed when only the EF-hands were used, which is in agreement with the mapping analysis in the yeast two-hybrid system with Shank3 (Fig. 1). In addition, a specific interaction of the α-fodrin (amino acids 2019–2472) cDNA clone with the Shank1189–399 cDNA construct was also observed in the yeast two-hybrid system (data not shown), indicating that both Shank1 and -3 are equivalent in their interactions with α-fodrin. Apparently the domains involved in the formation of the Shank1- or 3-α-fodrin complexes are different from those involved in the well characterized spectrin-ankyrin complex observed, for example, in red blood cells. In this case, the 15th spectrin repeat in the β-subunit of spectrin (27Kennedy S.P. Warren S.L. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 267-277Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar) interacts with a spectrin binding domain (which does not contain ankyrin repeats) of the ankyrin molecule (28Davis L.H. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10589-10596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify the interaction between Shank3 and α-fodrin in a mammalian system, COS7 cells were transfected either alone or in combination with cDNAs encoding the Flag-tagged α-fodrin2011–2472 and EGFP-tagged Shank3. Two Shank3 constructs were analyzed, one carrying the ankyrin repeats (Shank3240–442) and the other carrying the SH3 domain (Shank3536–610). As shown in Fig.3, in cells transfected only with Shank3240–442 carrying the ankyrin repeats, the tagged protein was specifically recruited to distinct structures within the cell nuclei (Fig. 3 A). This is presumably due to a cryptic nuclear localization signal in the construct (Lys-Arg-Arg-Arg, amino acids 429–432), because full-length Shank3 was not observed to appear in nuclei (data not shown). In contrast, when cells were transfected only with the Shank3536–610 construct that encodes the SH3 domain (Fig. 3 B) or with α-fodrin2011–2472, the tagged proteins were diffusely distributed in the cell cytoplasm (Fig. 3 C). Although it is unclear at present whether nuclear localization of the Shank3-ankyrin construct is of physiological relevance, it provided us with a unique opportunity to assay for strong protein interactions by looking for changes in the cellular localization of interacting proteins. Thus, when cotransfected in COS7 cells with the Shank3 construct carrying the ankyrin repeats, α-fodrin2011–2472 undergoes a dramatic redistribution into the same small punctae of the cell nuclei as seen for the tagged Shank3240–442 alone (Fig. 3, D–F). Similarly, a construct containing only spectrin repeat 21 (α-fodrin2091–2198) is targeted to the nucleus by interaction with the Shank3 ankyrin repeats (Fig. 3, G–I) underscoring the strong interaction of Shank3 and α-fodrin in mammalian cells.

To determine the intrinsic biochemical properties of the AtSERK1 protein, we have expressed the intracellular catalytic domain as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The AtSERK1-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein mainly autophosphorylates on threonine residues (Km for ATP, 4 × 10−6m), and the reaction is Mg2+dependent and inhibited by Mn2+. A K330E substitution in the kinase domain of AtSERK1 abolishes all kinase activity. The active AtSERK1kin can phosphorylate inactive AtSERK1K330E protein, suggesting an intermolecular mechanism of autophosphorylation. The AtSERK1 kinase protein was modeled using the insulin receptor kinase as a template. On the basis of this model, threonine residues in the AtSERK1 activation loop of catalytic subdomain VIII are potential targets for phosphorylation. AtSERK1 phosphorylation on myelin basic protein and casein showed tyrosine, serine, and threonine as targets, demonstrating that AtSERK1 is a dual specificity kinase. Replacing Thr-468 with either alanine or glutamic acid not only obliterated the ability of the AtSERK1 protein to be phosphorylated but also inhibited phosphorylation on myelin basic protein and casein, suggesting that Thr-468 is essential for AtSERK-mediated signaling.

Replacing Thr-468 with either alanine or glutamic acid not only obliterated the ability of the AtSERK1 protein to be phosphorylated but also inhibited phosphorylation on myelin basic protein and casein, suggesting that Thr-468 is essential for AtSERK-mediated signaling. receptor-like kinase leucin-rich repeat Arabidopsis thaliana somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase 1 glutathioneS-transferase insulin receptor kinase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis myelin basic protein Perception and transduction of external stimuli are essential for the growth and development of multicellular organisms. In many cases this involves membrane-associated receptor proteins of which the ligand binding domains perceive the extracellular signal molecule. Information is then transmitted through the kinase domains of the receptor that in turn lead to phosphorylation of target proteins (1Posada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 2Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). Most animal receptor kinases have tyrosine kinase activity, only a few are serine/threonine kinases (2Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

Tannock L. Ben-David Y. Pawson T. Bell J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that protein kinases also play important roles in cellular signaling and metabolic regulation in plants. Rapid and transient changes in the phosphorylation pattern of plant membrane-associated proteins have indicated the involvement of protein kinases in signaling events (5Raz V. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,6Reymond P. Short T.W. Briggs W.R. Poff K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4718-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Many plant genes encode receptor kinases sharing the same basic domain structures as shown in animal receptors and are called RLKs.1 Plant RLKs are involved in diverse processes such as hormone response (7Kieber J.J. Rothenberg M. Roman G. Feldmann K.A. Ecker J.R. Cell. 1993; 12: 427-441Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1463) Google Scholar), mitogenic induction (8Duerr B. Gawienowski M. Ropp T. Jacobs T.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), self-incompatibility (9Nassrallah J.B. Nassrallah M.E. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1325-1335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), shoot meristem development (10Clarke S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), and disease resistance (11Song W. Wang G. Chen L. Kim H. Pi L. Holsten T. Gardner J. Wang B. Zhai W. Zhu L. Fauquet C. Ronald P. Science. 1995; 270: 1804-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Expression studies have implicated RLKs to be involved in embryogenesis, pollen function, and light responses (12Lease K. Ingham E. Walker J.C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the basis of amino acid sequences of their extracellular domains, the RLKs reported so far have been categorized into six different types (13Torii K.U. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar): (a) the self-incompatibility domain type, with similarities to self-incompatibility locus glycoproteins in Brassica; (b) the epidermal growth factor receptor-like type; (c) the extracellular lectin domain type; (d) the tumor necrosis factor receptor domain type; (e) the pathogenesis-related protein domain type; and (f) the LRR type, with 3–26 leucine-rich repeats. The LRR motif occurs not only in receptor kinases but also in many other proteins as well and may be involved in protein-protein interactions (14Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Analysis based on mutant phenotypes has revealed that in particular the LRR type is involved in plant development (13Torii K.U. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Jin P. Guo T. Becraft P.W. Genesis. 2000; 27: 104-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The ERECTA gene was the first putative receptor containing extracellular LRRs to be cloned fromArabidopsis and is involved in organ elongation (16Torii K.U. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Matsuura Y. Yokoyama R. Whittier R.F. Komeda Y. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The best characterized of the plant LRR RLKs is the clavata 1 gene fromArabidopsis, which is similar in structure toERECTA. Clavata 1 is involved in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation and organ formation in shoot and the inflorescence meristems (10Clarke S.E. Williams R.W. Meyerowitz E.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Another example is the brassinosteroid receptor 1 gene (17Li J. Chory J. Cell. 1997; 90: 929-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Expression of plant RLKs in Escherichia coli or in insect cells yielded purified proteins suitable for biochemical studies. Plant RLKs were thus shown to autophosphorylate on serine or threonine residues or both. A possible exception is the Petuniapollen-expressed receptor-like kinase 1 gene, which autophosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues (18Mu J.H. Lee H.S. Kao T.H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation has been shown to occur predominantly by intermolecular mechanisms (trans), and it has been suggested that oligomerization may be involved in the regulation of the kinase activity (19Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The sites where phosphorylation occurs have so far only been identified in RLK1 from Catharanthus roseus. Site-directed mutagenesis has identified Thr-720 in the subdomain XI important both for auto- and transphosphorylation ofC. roseus RLK1 (20Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This report describes the biochemical characterization of an LRR RLK from Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSERK1. The encoding gene is expressed in ovules, zygotic embryos, and embryogenic suspension cultures ofArabidopsis. 2Hecht, V., Vielle-Calzada, J. P., Recklinghausen, I., Hartog, M. V., Zwartjes, C. G.

M., Schmidt, E. D. L., Boutilier, K., van Lammeren, A., and de Vries, S. C. (2001)Plant Physiol.,in press.During somatic embryogenesis, AtSERK1 expression continues up to early globular stage embryos and is absent in later stages of embryo development. This transient expression pattern is also observed during zygotic embryogenesis. DNA sequence analysis suggests that AtSERK1 consists of an extracellular domain that has a leucine zipper domain followed by five tandemly repeated leucine-rich motifs and a specific proline-rich region. The extracellular domain is linked via a transmembrane hydrophobic region to a protein kinase catalytic domain that is homologous to serine/threonine kinases. The catalytic kinase domain of the AtSERK1 protein was expressed as a recombinant fusion protein in E. coli. After assaying the activity of the AtSERK1 recombinant fusion protein, we found that AtSERK1 has an intrinsic protein kinase activity and autophosphorylates mainly on threonine, slightly on serine, but not on tyrosine residues. We report the identification of a threonine residue, Thr-468, that is involved in receptor autophosphorylation as well as in phosphorylation of substrate proteins. The kinetics of the autophosphorylation reaction suggest that it proceeds via an intermolecular mechanism. The cDNA sequence encoding the AtSERK1 (GenBankTM accession number A67827) kinase catalytic domain, corresponding to nucleotides 1000–2068 (Fig. 1), was amplified by PCR using the 2.1-kilobase pair cDNA cloned in vector pBluescriptII SK− as a template. PrimerSmaI1000 (5′-TCCCCCGGGTATTTTCTTCGATGTCCCTG-3′) and primerNotI2068 (5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCCTTGGACCAGATA-3′) amplified a PCR fragment of 1.1 kilobase pairs that was cloned into aSmaI- and NotI-cleaved pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in the AtSERK1kin construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of highly conserved lysine, Lys-330, essential for phosphotransfer in protein kinases, to glutamic acid was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene), resulting in the AtSERK1K330E construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of all three threonine residues, Thr-462, Thr-463, and Thr-468, to glutamic acid resulted in an AtSERK13T→Econstruct, whereas the single amino acid mutations were made, resulting in AtSERK1T459E, AtSERK1T462E, AtSERK1T463E, and AtSERK1T468E constructs. The same amino acids were also mutated to alanine residues, resulting in AtSERK1T459A, AtSERK1T462A, AtSERK1T463A, and AtSERK1T468A. All plasmids were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing before being transformed into the E. coli Bl21 strain for protein expression. A 2-ml overnight culture was transferred to 200 ml of LB medium, and the cells were grown at 37 °C to anA600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3–4 h at 30 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 6 ml of phosphate-buffered saline lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Mini; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), sonicated, and cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The soluble GST fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant by glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography according to the manufacturer's instructions. The x-ray structures of IRK (inactive IRK, determined at 1.9 Å resolution; Ref. 22Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and IRK3P (activated human IRK, refined to 2.1 Å resolution; Ref. 23Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) were used as templates for modeling the AtSERK1 kinase domain. These two templates produced the best E value when using BLAST against the Protein Data Bank data base. The sequence of the kinase domain of AtSERK1 was aligned with the sequence of the insulin receptor kinase using the advanced BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Models of the kinase domain of AtSERK1 in its activated and inactive form were built using the Modeler-5 program of Sali and Blundell (24Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10294) Google Scholar). Modeler is an excellent program for comparative structural modeling, because it results in a very accurate, detailed, and explicit model of protein structure (25Sanchez R. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26Francoijs C.J. Klomp J.P. Knegtel R.M Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The quality of the three-dimensional models was evaluated using PROCHECK and Prosa II version 3.0 (27Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar). The two programs can evaluate the quality of three-dimensional homology models very well (26Francoijs C.J. Klomp J.P. Knegtel R.M Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Improvement of the models could be obtained by an iterative sequence-structure alignment procedure, yielding finally the sequence alignment between the AtSERK1 kinase domain and IRK. This improvement in the sequence-structure alignment procedure was especially important for the loop (amino acids 498–515), which is present in the AtSERK1 kinase domain but not in the insulin receptor kinase. The kinase activity of the AtSERK1kin and the AtSERK1kin mutant GST fusion proteins was demonstrated by incubating 500 ng (100 µg/ml) of protein in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 µm unlabeled ATP, and 10 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 30 µl. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was quenched by adding Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue to verify equal loading and then dried. The radioactivity was quantified with a PhosphoImager using the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). To remove the GST tag from AtSERK1kin and AtSERK13T→E proteins, 50 µg of each was treated with 10 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at 16 °C for 4 h. Phosphorylation assays were performed in a similar way by incubating the cleaved AtSERK1kin or AtSERK13T→E proteins with AtSERK1K330E in concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 ng. For phosphorylation assays of AtSERK1 with artificial substrates, 1 µg of casein (Sigma) or MBP (Sigma) was incubated with 500 ng of AtSERK1kin or with AtSERK1kin mutant proteins. The reaction conditions were the same as described above. The Coomassie brilliant blue-stained phosphorylated bands of AtSERK1kin, casein, and MBP were excised from the gel, rehydrated in 50 mm(NH4)2CO3, 0.1% SDS, and 0.25% β-mercaptoethanol, ground with a small pestle, boiled for 5 min, and extracted by agitation for 90 min. The proteins were precipitated by adding 20 µg of bovine serum albumin and 20% (w/v) solid trichloroacetic acid and incubated overnight at −20 °C. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, and the trichloroacetic acid was removed by lyophilization for 30 min. The sample was hydrolyzed in 50 µl of 6 m HCl for 1 h at 120 °C. The HCl was evaporated, and the pellet was resuspended in the ascending solvent of ethanol, glacial acetic acid, and water (1:1:1 v/v/v) containing 20 nmol of each phosphoamino acid standard. The sample was applied to a 10 × 10 cellulose TLC plate (Merck) as described (28Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) using the ascending solvent for 90 min. The first dimension fractionation was followed by second dimension chromatography in a phosphopeptide buffer containing isobutyl alcohol, formic acid, and water (8:3:4 v/v/v) for 1 h. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized by spraying the plate with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone, and heating it at 65 °C for 30 min. The radiographic film was exposed to the TLC plate for 12 h, and the radioactivity was quantified with the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). The deduced protein sequence of AtSERK1 (Fig.1A) consists of 605 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 68,000. The predicted domain structure has the general structure of the RLK-type kinases (29Braun D.M. Walker J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 70-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar): it consists of a hydrophobic N-terminal putative signal peptide, an extracellular domain consisting of a leucine zipper domain, five leucine-rich repeats, and a proline-rich region unique for the AtSERK1 family (30Baudino S. Hansen S. Brettschneider R. Hecht V.F.G. Dresselhaus T. Lörz H. Dumas C. Rogowsky P.M. Planta. 2001; 213: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) followed by a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain of 24 amino acids and an intracellular C-terminal kinase catalytic domain. AtSERK1 has seven putative N-glycosylation sites, five of which are located in the extracellular LRR domain (Fig. 1). This distribution is characteristic for RLKs, and there is evidence that RLKs are indeed glycoproteins (31Schaller G.E. Bleecker A.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The AtSERK1 protein kinase catalytic domain has all of the 11 subdomains as described for protein kinases (32Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar) and is predicted to have a serine/threonine protein kinase activity based on conserved amino acids found in subdomains V1b and VIII. Fusion proteins were constructed in which GST was fused in frame to the N-terminal end of the AtSERK1 kinase domain. After expression inE. coli Bl21, GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose. In a standard assay with 10 mmdivalent cations, the autophosphorylation was complete after 25–35 min (Fig. 2A); therefore, 30-min incubations were used routinely. There was no autophosphorylation when MgCl2 was left out of the reaction mixture. The addition of MnCl2 considerably reduced the activity, whereas addition of CaCl2 had no influence on the autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 2B). Optimal autophosphorylation activity was achieved with 10 mm MgCl2 (data not shown). The AtSERK1kin protein exhibited standard Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to ATP, with a Km of 4 × 10−6m and a Vmax of 4.6 × 10−9.mg/min (data not shown). To further confirm the specific kinase activity of the AtSERK1kin protein, the AtSERK1K330E mutant protein in which the essential lysine required for the phosphotransfer was replaced by glutamic acid and was analyzed for kinase activity. Fig. 2C shows that the AtSERK1K330E mutant protein no longer autophosphorylates, confirming that AtSERK1 is a functional receptor kinase. To determine which amino acids are autophosphorylated, the 32P-labeled proteins were subjected to total hydrolysis. The subsequent analysis of the radioactive amino acids (Fig. 2D) showed that the autophosphorylation was mainly on threonines (∼80%), partly on serines (∼18%), and low on tyrosines (∼2%). To identify the precise residues on which AtSERK1 autophosphorylates, we compared the predicted three-dimensional models of the AtSERK1 kinase domain with the well-characterized structure of the kinase domain of human insulin receptor. The Z scores of the AtSERK1 models as determined by Prosa II were −7.1 and −7.0. These values imply that both AtSERK1 models according to the quality assessment criteria developed by Sanchez and Sali (25Sanchez R. Sali A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13597-13602Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) are very reliable (p(GOOD/Q-SCORE) = 0.99). The PROCHECK evaluation of the models showed that 98.9% of residues are in the φ/ψ most favored/additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. In addition the side chain parameters χ-1 and χ-2 determined by PROCHECK are better than a protein x-ray crystal structure model with 2.0-Å resolution. Comparing the x-ray structures of the active (IRK3P) and the inactive human IRK has revealed that major structural changes occur on phosphorylation (22Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar, 23Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In the inactive IRK structure, the activation A-loop (residues 1149–1170) traverses the cleft between the N- and C-terminal lobes so that the protein substrate-binding site is largely blocked. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-1158, Tyr-1162, and Tyr-1163 results in a dramatic change in the confirmation of the IRK A-loop. One of the tyrosines, Tyr-1158, is displaced ∼30 Å from its position in the unphosphorylated A-loop. The conformational change of the phosphorylated A-loop permits unrestricted access to the binding sites for ATP and protein substrates (23Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Although the homology between the predicted AtSERK1 kinase sequence and the IRK is no more than 26%, a comparison of the model of the AtSERK1 kinase domain and the inactive 1IRK shows that they superimpose very well except for an extra loop region in the AtSERK1 kinase (amino acids 498–515). Because it is known that the activation of the insulin receptor kinase occurs by autophosphorylation on residues present within the activation loop of subdomains VII and VIII (33Rosen O.M. Herrera R. Olowe Y. Petruzzelli L.M. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3237-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar), we designated the same region in the AtSERK1 kinase domain as the AtSERK1 A-loop (Fig.3, A and B). The AtSERK1 A-loop begins with an invariant asparagine in subdomain VII (Asp-447 in AtSERK1) and terminates with an invariant glutamic acid in subdomain VIII (Glu-475 in AtSERK1; Ref. 35Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). The AtSERK1 A-loop contains 4 threonine residues, Thr-459, Thr-462, Thr-463, and Thr-468, and the tyrosine, Tyr-456, that are potential phosphorylation sites. In the AtSERK1 kinase model, the major region of the AtSERK1 A-loop is quite identical to that of the A-loop of the inactive insulin receptor kinase. On the basis of the prediction of the presence of the threonines in the AtSERK1 A-loop and the predominantly serine/threonine autophosphorylation properties (Fig. 2D), we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the three threonines that might be involved in the autophosphorylation of AtSERK1. This led us to making a mutant construct, AtSERK13T→E, in which Thr-462, Thr-463, and Thr-468 in AtSERK1 A-loop were changed to glutamic acid. Assays with bacterially expressed affinity-purified AtSERK13T→Emutant protein showed an almost complete absence of phosphorylated residues (Fig. 4A, lane 2). Only a long exposure of the film revealed a radioactive band, but it was too weak to attempt to identify the phosphorylated amino acids. It may represent the weak phosphorylation of serine that was observed after total hydrolysis of AtSERK1kin (Fig.2D). To investigate the role of the individual threonine residues, Thr-462, Thr-463, and Thr-468 in AtSERK1 autophosphorylation, all 3 threonine residues were mutagenized separately to glutamic acid or to alanine. To ensure that the fourth threonine residue, Thr-459, in the AtSERK1 A-loop did not have any influence on the phosphorylation status of AtSERK1 kinase, we also mutagenized Thr-459 either to glutamic acid or to alanine. The threonine mutations either to glutamic acid or to alanine residues were performed to ensure that the substitution of threonines did not influence the protein structure and thus the kinase activity. The assays with purified proteins showed that there was a reduction in phosphorylation activity from 1.0 (a relative unit obtained after densitometric scanning of the gel containing the radiolabeled AtSERK1kin protein; Fig. 4A, lane 1) to 0.3 for the AtSERK1T462E mutant protein (Fig.4A, lane 4) and to 0.01 for the AtSERK1T468Emutant protein (Fig. 4A, lane 6). There was also a reduction in phosphorylation activity from 1.0 (AtSERK1kin protein; Fig. 4B, lane 1) to 0.35 for the AtSERK1T462Amutant protein (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and to 0.00 for the AtSERK1T468A mutant protein (Fig. 4B, lane 6). The effect on phosphorylation activity with both types of substitutions was similar, which reveals that the resulting kinase activity is due to the removal of threonine residues and not likely to be due to the identity of the newly introduced amino acid residues. The ability of AtSERK1 protein to phosphorylate other proteins was tested with common substrates such as casein and MBP (Fig.5). Both proteins were clearly phosphorylated by AtSERK1kin. The AtSERK1kinprotein phosphorylates casein (Fig. 5A, lane 1) less when compared with MBP (Fig. 5C, lane 1). Both casein and MBP phosphorylation were reduced when they were incubated either with mutant AtSERK13T→E or AtSERK1K330E proteins. There was a reduction in casein phosphorylation activity from 1.0 (casein phosphorylated by AtSERK1kin; Fig. 5A, lane 1) to 0.015 for casein phosphorylated by the AtSERK1K330E mutant (Fig. 5A, lane 2) and to 0.012 for the AtSERK13T→E mutant (Fig. 5A, lane 3). There was also a reduction in MBP phosphorylation activity from 1.0 (MBP phosphorylated by the AtSERK1kin protein; Fig. 5C, lane 1) to 0.00 for the AtSERK1K330Emutant protein (Fig. 5C, lane 2) and to 0.00 for the AtSERK13T→E mutant protein (Fig. 5C, lane 3). To further determine whether the individual threonines influenced the phosphorylation of casein or MBP, we incubated AtSERK1T459A, AtSERK1T462A, AtSERK1T463A, and AtSERK1T468A mutant proteins with casein (Fig. 5B) and MBP (Fig. 5D). Both casein and MBP were not phosphorylated by AtSERK1T462A and AtSERK1T468A (Fig. 5, B and D,lanes 2 and 4). To determine the identity of the phosphorylated amino acids in casein and MBP, the32P-labeled protein bands were excised from the gel and were subjected to total hydrolysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” The subsequent analysis of the radioactive amino acids showed that the transphosphorylation of casein was mostly on serine and threonine (Fig. 5E), whereas MBP was transphosphorylated predominantly on tyrosine residues (Fig. 5F). These results identified two threonine residues, Thr-462 and Thr-468, in the AtSERK1 kinase domain that are important for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of artificial substrates such as casein and MBP. Thr-468 appears to be indispensable for AtSERK1 activity, whereas Thr-462 may be predominantly involved in posphorylation of substrates. Furthermore, AtSERK1 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation on MBP and casein show tyrosine, serine, and threonine as targets, suggesting that AtSERK1 is a dual specificity kinase. The AtSERK1 reaction showed second order kinetics (Fig.6A), which suggests that AtSERK1 autophosphorylates by intermolecular phosphorylation (19Horn M.A. Walker J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1208: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To provide additional evidence for intermolecular phosphorylation of AtSERK1, we tested whether a thrombin-cleaved AtSERK1kin-GST fusion protein was able to phosphorylate the mutant AtSERK1K330E-GST fusion protein. The AtSERK1K330E protein was phosphorylated only in the presence of AtSERK1kin (Fig. 6B, lane 2). Although AtSERK1kin was able to phosphorylate AtSERK1K330E, The level of phosphorylation of the AtSERK1K330E-GST fusion protein was ∼3-fold less compared with the thrombin-cleaved AtSERK1kin protein. This was due to the presence of the GST protein rather then the K330E mutation, because a comparable reduction was observed when incubating an AtSERK1kin-GST fusion protein was a thrombin-cleaved AtSERK1kin protein (results not shown). The phosphorylation of AtSERK1K330E in the presence of AtSERK1kinprotein clearly demonstrates the intermolecular character of the AtSERK1 reaction. We also incubated the mix of AtSERK13T→E and AtSERK1K330E proteins together with or without casein or MBP in a phosphorylation assay. The results show that AtSERK13T→E protein is not able to phosphorylate the AtSERK1K330E protein (Fig. 6C, lane 1) regardless of the presence of a potentially active catalytic site in the AtSERK13T→E protein. Furthermore, this mutant protein mix is not able to phosphorylate casein or MBP (Fig.6C, lanes 2 and 3). These results suggest that under in vitro conditions, phosphorylation of Thr-468 and perhaps also Thr-462 requires the presence of another AtSERK1 oligomer and that the catalytic activity of AtSERK1 in turn depends on the presence of a phosphorylated threonine residue in the AtSERK1 A-loop. We suggest that the AtSERK1 A-loop phosphorylation is required both for autophosphorylation and for phosphorylation of substrate proteins. The general validity of this model for plant receptor-like kinases is supported by the observation that in a wide range of receptors, including the AtSERK family (30Baudino S. Hansen S. Brettschneider R. Hecht V.F.G. Dresselhaus T. Lörz H. Dumas C. Rogowsky P.M. Planta. 2001; 213: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), a threonine at a position 7 amino acids from the end of the A-loop is conserved (Fig. 7). The ArabidopsisAtSERK1 gene is a member of the diverse family of serine/threonine receptor kinases that have been identified in plants. In this study we have shown that the AtSERK1 catalytic domain indeed exhibits phosphorylation activity on serine and threonine. A single amino acid substitution of Lys-330 to Glu-330, an invariant lysine found in the catalytic site of all protein kinases, abolishes the AtSERK1 kinase activity completely. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Thr-462 and Thr-468 as the putative intermolecular targets of AtSERK1 kinase activity in vitro. Finally, we have shown that AtSERK1 is capable of phosphorylating artificial substrates such as casein and MBP on both serine and threonine as well as tyrosine, respectively. This classifies AtSERK1 as a dual specificity-type receptor kinase with respect to its autophosphorylation as well as its substrate phosphorylation activities. AtSERK1kin resembles C. roseus RLK1 (20Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), RLK4 (36Coello P. Sassen A. Haywood V. Davis K. Walker J.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 559-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) plant RLKs, which all have a preference for threonine autophosphorylation. To our knowledge, only two previous studies have identified a specific target site for autophosphorylation in plant RLKs. Using formic acid digests and site-directed mutagenesis, it was shown that Thr-720 was required for phosphorylation of C. roseus RLK1 (20Schulze-Muth P. Irmler S. Schroder G. Schroder J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26684-26689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry on the brassinosteroid receptor 1 kinase domain, the presence of five phosphorylation sites was shown, one each in subdomains 1 and VIa and three in subdomain VIII (40Oh M.H. Ray W.K. Huber S.C. Asara J.M. Gage D.A. Clouse S.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Using computer-assisted molecular modeling in combination with the functional studies of various kinase domains of transmembrane receptors has given an insight into the conformational changes that take place once the receptors are activated (41Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In our studies we used the x-ray crystal structure of the unphosphorylated (22Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) and phosphorylated (23Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) IRK as templates for the modeling experiments. The computer-modeled structure of the AtSERK1kin compared with the IRK structure showed a striking similarity except for the region that is present on subdomain IX of AtSERK1. This similarity is remarkable given the very low homology at the protein sequence level and the fact that the IRK protein has tyrosine kinase activity. Apparently structural conservation among kinases is much stronger than sequence conservation or biochemical properties. This notion is further strengthened when the A-loop in IRK that is formed from subdomains VII and VIII of the protein kinase catalytic core (34Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) is examined in more detail. In IRK, this loop contains 3 tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated and that are of importance for receptor kinase signaling activity (23Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In the AtSERK1 kinase model, the same kind of A-loop in the AtSERK1 kinase domain is observed. The major difference is the presence of threonines in the AtSERK1 A-loop instead of tyrosines in the IRK A-loop. On the basis of the prediction that the threonines in AtSERK1 might fulfill the same role as tyrosines in IRK, mutant proteins were constructed in which Thr-459, Thr-462, Thr-463, and Thr-468 were mutated individually to either alanine or to glutamic acid residues. After kinase activity measurements, it appeared that Thr-468 was the most likely single target for intermolecular AtSERK1 kinase activity. However, definite confirmation of the role of Thr-468 in vivo will require additional analysis using mass spectrometry of phosphorylated peptide fragments of AtSERK1 and site-specific antibodies directed against the A-loop region. Both of these experiments are currently in progress. Nevertheless, it is of interest to note that all three phosphorylation sites in subdomain VIII of brassinosteroid receptor 1 (40Oh M.H. Ray W.K. Huber S.C. Asara J.M. Gage D.A. Clouse S.D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 751-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) lie within the predicted A-loop region, given that the activation of many protein kinases occurs by autophosphorylation of 1–3 residues within the activation loop of subdomain VIII (35Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Like animal receptor kinases, the subdomains representing the AtSERK1 A-loop may also be important for the phosphorylation of plant RLKs in general. Not only do many RLKs have serine or threonine residues, some of which were shown to be phosphorylated in vitro, in the corresponding A-loop regions (Fig. 7), also genetic analysis points to the functional importance of this region. Numerous mutants affecting brassinosteroid signaling fall within the proposed A-loop region (12Lease K. Ingham E. Walker J.C. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), including brassinosteroid receptor 1-104 and brassinosteroid receptor 1-115 (17Li J. Chory J. Cell. 1997; 90: 929-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The importance of A-loop phosphorylation is supported by our finding that on mutation of Thr-468 (conserved in most of the plant RLKs; Fig. 7), all AtSERK1 phosphorylation activity is lost. In addition to the intermolecular autophosphorylation reaction, we were also interested in AtSERK1 phosphorylation on exogenous substrates. AtSERK1 can phosphorylate both serine/threonine- and tyrosine-containing substrates, which widens the spectrum of downstream proteins it might interact with. So far tyrosine kinase activity has not been widely encountered in plants, although the identification of the rolB protein as a tyrosine phosphatase (42Filippini F. Rossi V. Marin O. Trovato M. Costantino P. Downey P.M. Lo Schiavo F. Terzi M.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 499-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) suggests that it does occur. AtSERK1 is unable to phosphorylate substrates when the threonine mutants are used. It is known that the phosphorylation of the A-loop shifts the equilibrium toward a conformation that accommodates protein substrate binding. Point mutations in the A-loop of various receptor kinases are presumed to alter this equilibrium (41Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11987-11990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and thus influence protein substrate binding and subsequent phosphorylation of substrates. Indeed, in the AtSERK1 threonine mutant proteins, the AtSERK1 substrate phosphorylation activity was abolished, suggesting that the AtSERK1 A-loop may be involved in protein substrate binding. Autophosphorylation activity and activation of the transmembrane receptor protein kinases is generally mediated by ligand-induced dimerization (43Heldin C.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 213-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). The activation of autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain of the receptor is mediated by an intermolecular mechanism of phosphorylation. Dimerization and intermolecular autophosphorylation of a nuclear serine/threonine kinase from A. thaliana has been shown (21Roe J.L Durfee T. Zupan J.R. Repetti P.P. McLean B.G. Zambryski P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5838-5845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In our studies we also examined the mechanism of the autophosphorylation reaction of AtSERK1. The observation that the AtSERK1kin can phosphorylate the AtSERK1K330E protein suggests that the AtSERK1 protein catalyzes an intermolecular autophosphorylation in vitro. On the basis of the experiments reported here, we propose that, either by the presence of a minor population of catalytically active AtSERK1 molecules in vitro or by ligand-induced conformational changes in vivo, AtSERK1 activation requires intermolecular autophosphorylation. This results in movement of the AtSERK1 threonine-containing A-loop followed by improved accessibility of the catalytic domain to commence substrate phosphorylation activity and protein substrate binding. In this model, A-loop phosphorylation of one AtSERK1 monomer is also essential for intermolecular autophosphorylation activity of that monomer. We thank Joachim Goedhart for help with the phosphoaminoacid acid analysis, Ingrid Rienties for performing and quantifying control phosphorylation experiments, and Casper Vroemen and Kees Jan Francoijs for stimulating discussions during the preparation of the manuscript."

The superfamily members include TGF-β, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), all of which signal through heteromeric complexes of cell-surface type I and II protein serine/threonine kinase receptors. Upon ligand binding, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, thereby activating its kinase activity for phosphorylation of Smad proteins, the key intracellular mediators of TGF-β signaling pathways (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Smad proteins contain two highly conserved domains: MH1, which is located at the N terminus and mediates DNA binding, and MH2, which is located at the C terminus and is capable of transcriptional activation and complex formation among different Smad proteins. These are joined in the middle by a more variable proline-rich linker region. According to their functional characteristics, Smad proteins are divided into three classes: receptor-regulated Smad (R-Smad) proteins, which are direct substrates of activated type I receptors (including Smad1 and Smad5 of the BMP signaling pathway and Smad2 and Smad3 of the TGF-β/activin pathway); common Smad (Co-Smad) proteins, which are not direct substrates of receptor kinases, but form complexes with phosphorylated R-Smad proteins; and inhibitory or antagonistic Smad (I-Smad) proteins, which counteract the functions of R-Smad proteins (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the only member of the Co-Smad class is Smad4, which forms signaling complexes with Smad1 or Smad5 upon BMP stimulation or with Smad2 or Smad3 upon TGF-β/activin addition. Following complex formation, hetero-oligomers between R-Smad and Co-Smad proteins translocate into the nucleus to effect transcriptional regulation of target genes (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Signal-directed nuclear import and export are two ways to regulate the availability of transcription factors inside the nucleus and are widely used by cells to modulate signal transduction pathways. Nuclear import is usually conferred by a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a basic sequence sufficient and necessary for nuclear import of the protein. There are two major types of NLSs: (i) a single stretch of five to six basic amino acids, exemplified by the SV40 large T-antigen NLS; and (ii) a bipartite NLS composed of two basic amino acids, a spacer region of 10–12 amino acids, and a basic cluster in which three of five amino acids must be basic, typified by nucleoplasmin. In NLS-mediated nuclear import, the NLS first associates with the cytosolic import receptor proteins importin-α and -β, allowing docking at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore. Translocation then proceeds through the pore via an energy-driven process (3Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar, 4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The nuclear export signal (NES), a short leucine-rich motif, has been identified as a transport signal that is necessary and sufficient to mediate nuclear export of large proteins (4Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The consensus sequence is defined as a set of critically spaced hydrophobic residues, usually leucines (LXXLXXLXL, whereX indicates any residue) (5Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 8: 4207-4214Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar), although certain variations are allowed. Many proteins owe their extranuclear distributions to an NES, including human immunodeficiency virus Rev and Rex, protein kinase A inhibitor, Ran-binding protein 1, and MAPK kinase (3Gorlich D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). CRM1/exportin-1, which was first identified in fission yeast, is the cellular receptor for NES (7Fukuda M. Gotoh I. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Smad3 contains an N-terminal basic NLS motif that is required for ligand-induced nuclear translocation; this motif is required for the interaction between Smad3 and importin-β (9Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 10Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mutations in this motif abolish Smad3 nuclear import, but do not interfere with its other functions such as ligand-dependent complex formation with Smad4 and DNA binding. Smad4, unlike R-Smad proteins, is unable to translocate into nucleus by itself since it contains an NES that mediates constant nuclear exclusion. Only upon complex formation with R-Smad proteins is the NES masked, which enables Smad4 to accumulate inside the nucleus (11Liu F. Pouponnot C. Massague J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3157-3167Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The Smad3 NLS is conserved in Smad1 and other R-Smad proteins, suggesting that it is responsible for ligand-induced nuclear import of all R-Smad proteins. In contrast, the Smad4 NES is not conserved in R-Smad proteins; and therefore, we do not know whether the cytoplasmic distribution of R-Smad proteins in the resting state is due to active nuclear export. Here we demonstrate that leptomycin B (LMB) or BMP treatment induced rapid nuclear accumulation of endogenous Smad1 as well as transfected Smad1. Ligand-induced nuclear import is dependent on the N-terminal basic NLS motif since mutations or deletions of this segment, although unable to interfere with normal ligand-dependent DNA binding of Smad1 and its complex formation with Smad4, abrogated nuclear accumulation of Smad1 in response to BMP-4. Additionally, we show that Smad1 contains a C-terminal leucine-rich NES that mediates its constant nuclear export by interacting with CRM1. Furthermore, this NES motif directed nuclear exclusion of a fused heterologous protein, and disruption of the NES resulted in nuclear retention of Smad1 regardless of ligand stimulation. Finally, disruption of either the NLS or NES resulted in decreased reporter gene activities, indicating that both signals are required for optimal transcriptional activation by Smad1. We conclude that Smad1 is under constant nucleocytoplasmic shuttling conferred by its NLS and NES and that its accumulation in the nucleus after ligand-induced phosphorylation represents a change in the balance of activities between these opposing signals. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Smad1 was constructed with theCLONTECH pEGFP-C1 vector that allows an in-frame fusion of human Smad1 to the C terminus of enhanced GFP. COS-7, C2C12, and BOSC cells were transiently transfected with Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mutations of the Smad1 NLS and NES were created using the QuikChange mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). For Smad1 NLS mutant 1 (NLSmut1),K39K40LKKKK45was changed toN39Q40LKKKK45; for Smad1 NLS mutant 2 (NLSmut2), K39KLKKKK45was changed to K39K40L (deletion of K42KKK45); and for the Smad1 NES mutant (NESmut),L406TKM409CTIRM was changed toA406TKA409CTIRM (first two large hydrophobic residues changed to alanines). Peptides corresponding to WT or mutant Smad1 NES motif were fused in frame to the C terminus of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and expressed in BL21 cells. Various GST-NES fusion proteins were purified at 0.5–1.0 mg/ml in injection buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.4) and 200 mmKCl), combined 1:1 with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (15 mg/ml at 4 mol of FITC/mol of dextran (Mr70,000); Molecular Probes, Inc.), and injected into the nuclei of 35% confluent 3T3 fibroblast cells using an Eppendorf Injectman system at the Keck Microscope Facility of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, injected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. GST-NES fusion proteins were detected with goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc.). For endogenous Smad1 immunofluorescence, goat polyclonal anti-Smad1 antibody (N18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. This antibody also cross-reacts with Smad5 and Smad8, close homologs of Smad1. C2C12 or COS-7 cells were grown to 50% confluence on coverslips in six-well plates. Before or after BMP-4 or LMB treatment, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10–15 min, permeabilized with 0.15% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked with 4% normal donkey serum for 30 min, and then stained with a 1:75 dilution of the goat anti-Smad1 antibody (in 4% donkey normal serum) overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing, FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody was added at a 1:500 dilution for 1 h. To detect endogenous Smad3 in Mv1Lu cells, rabbit anti-Smad3 antibody (sc-8332, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:50 dilution. This antibody also recognizes Smad2. Immunofluorescence was performed essentially as described (14Liu X. Sun Y. Ehrlich M. Lu T. Kloog Y. Weinberg R.A. Lodish H.F. Henis Y.I. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5926-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GFP fluorescence in transfected or infected cells (live or fixed) and GST immunofluorescence were visualized with a Nikon TE300 inverted microscope equipped for epifluorescence using a 488-nm excitation filter and a 522/535-nm emission filter. Images were recorded with a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera and analyzed with OpenLab software at the Keck Microscope Facility of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research. Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described (15Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with an appropriate combination of Smad1 and Smad4 expression plasmids were used. Prior to cell lysis, cells were treated or not with 100 ng/ml BMP-4 for 1 h to achieve Smad1 activation. Probe 9xGCCG was purified and labeled as described previously (15Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). 3 µg of cell lysates were added to premix solution containing poly(dI-dC) and 5 × 104 cpm of the labeled probe. Supershifts were performed with anti-Smad1 or anti-Smad4 antibodies. Complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by autoradiography. 24 h before transfection, Mv1Lu cells were seeded in triplicate at 2 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate. 1 µg each of 3GC2-luciferase, constitutively active ALK3(Q204D), and the indicated Smad1 vectors were cotransfected per well using Fugene 6. 0.5 µg of pSVβ (CLONTECH), encoding β-galactosidase, were included in each sample to control for transfection efficiency. 24 h after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as described previously (9Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Smad1 contains an N-terminal basic NLS-like motif that is well conserved among all R-Smad proteins (Fig. 1). In Smad3, this motif acts as an NLS since mutations or deletions in this segment specifically disrupt ligand-induced nuclear import of Smad3 without affecting its ability to bind DNA or form complexes with Smad4 (9Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Smad1 and its close homologs Smad5 and Smad8, the NLS motif contains two more lysines than does Smad3 (KKLKKTGfor Smad3 and KKLKKKK for Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8), thus more closely mimicking the classical NLS of large T-antigen. Interestingly, most of the basic residues in this motif are also present in the I-Smad proteins Smad6 and Smad7, implying that this sequence may be responsible for the observed nuclear localization of Smad7 in the resting state (16Itoh S.

To achieve live cell imaging, we constructed a GFP-Smad1 fusion protein and transiently expressed it in BMP-responsive COS-7 cells. GFP fusion does not interfere with the normal functionality of Smad1 (see below). In resting (non-BMP-stimulated) COS-7 cells, Smad1 was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.2, panel 1). We do not know whether this partial nuclear localization is due to weak autocrine stimulation by endogenously produced BMP. To elucidate the role the NLS-like motif may play in Smad1 nuclear translocation, we created substitution or deletion mutants in this segment and studied their localization with or without BMP stimulation. After a 1-h treatment with BMP-4, the GFP-wild type (WT) Smad1 fusion protein completely accumulated inside the nucleus. In contrast, the substitution mutant (NLSmut1, K39N/K40Q) showed much weaker nuclear accumulation, and the deletion mutant (NLSmut2, ΔK42KKK45) failed to display any nuclear enrichment. This indicates that the N-terminal basic motif of Smad1 acts as its NLS and is essential for BMP-induced nuclear accumulation. Transient expression of these proteins in other BMP-responsive cell lines such as C2C12 yielded similar results (data not shown). We confirmed these observations using FLAG-tagged Smad1 constructs, which were visualized by immunofluorescence after cell fixation. Again, WT Smad1 showed rapid nuclear import after BMP-4 stimulation. In contrast, NLSmut1 and NLSmut2 both were defective in this response, and the latter was largely excluded from the nucleus both in the basal state and after BMP-4 stimulation (data not shown). Smad4 has previously been shown to contain an NES in the N-terminal part of its linker region that is unique to Co-Smad proteins and that is not conserved in R-Smad proteins (12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that R-Smad proteins may contain a hitherto undefined NES, we treated C2C12 cells transiently expressing GFP-Smad1 with LMB, a specific inhibitor of the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. Despite the fact that GFP-Smad1 is partially nuclear in the resting state, LMB induced significant nuclear accumulation within 1 h of treatment (Fig.3A), suggesting that in the basal state, Smad1 is subject to constant NES-mediated nuclear export. This was confirmed by a similar experiment in a different cell line (Fig. 3B). Similar to overexpression in COS-7 or C2C12 cells, in unstimulated BOSC cells, GFP-Smad1 was also dispersed throughout the cells. It underwent dramatic nuclear accumulation within 30 min of LMB treatment (Fig. 3B, panels 1and 2). We further confirmed that Smad1 contains an NES by overexpressing CRM1, the cellular export receptor for NESs. CRM1 overexpression can induce dramatic nuclear exclusions of NES-containing proteins, especially ones with a weak NES. This assay has been used to prove the existence of NES in various proteins (17Rodriguez J.A. Henderson B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38589-38596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of CRM1 forced Smad1 into an almost exclusive cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 3B,panel 3), proving that Smad1 contains a functional NES and that CRM1 is the physiological export receptor for Smad1. The previous experiments utilized living cells expressing a transfected GFP-Smad1 fusion protein. To confirm that our conclusions also apply to endogenous Smad1, we studied the subcellular distributions of native Smad1 in different BMP-responsive cell lines through immunostaining with a specific Smad1 antibody (Fig.4). Under resting conditions, endogenous Smad1 was distributed throughout C2C12 cells with a preferential cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 4A, left panel). BMP-4 treatment induced its rapid nuclear accumulation within 30 min (Fig. 4A, right panel), confirming the involvement of Smad1 in BMP signal transduction. Treatment of C2C12 cells with LMB for 1–2 h caused a dramatic accumulation of Smad1 within the nucleus (Fig. 4A, middle panel), indicating that it is normally subject to both nuclear import and nuclear export. In the resting state, nuclear export must be relatively stronger than the import to maintain the preferential cytoplasmic profile of Smad1. When export is suppressed by LMB, Smad1 accumulates inside the nucleus due to import signaled by the N-terminal NLS motif. However, since BMP-4-induced nuclear enrichment of Smad1 seems more complete than LMB-induced nuclear accumulation (Fig. 4A, compare middle and right panels), we speculate that BMP-4 suppresses nuclear export of Smad1 as well as enhances its nuclear import function. To our knowledge, this study represents the first analysis of the subcellular distribution of endogenous (i.e. untransfected) Smad1. A second study of endogenous Smad1 in COS-7 cells confirmed and extended the above results obtained with C2C12 cells (Fig.4B). Similar to C2C12 cells, in the resting state, Smad1 in COS-7 cells was more cytoplasmic than nuclear (Fig. 4B,panel 1) and became rapidly enriched in the nucleus within 30 min of BMP-4 treatment (panel 3). LMB addition also resulted in significant nuclear accumulation of Smad1 (Fig.4B, panel 7), indicating that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of endogenous Smad1 occurs in both cell lines. More interestingly, when the BMP treatment was allowed to proceed for 3–4 h, Smad1 re-localized back to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B,panel 5), suggesting that prolonged ligand treatment may lead to desensitization of the signaling pathway by cytoplasmic retention of Smad1. Since Smad1 undergoes constant nuclear export and since the export could be enhanced by increased CRM1 levels (Fig. 3B), we studied whether CRM1 overexpression could reverse the BMP-dependent nuclear accumulation of endogenous Smad1. CRM1 and GFP (as transfection marker) were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells, and the nuclear import of endogenous Smad1 was analyzed after 30 min of treatment with BMP-4 (Fig. 4C, part 1). Cells were stained for Smad1 and GFP (the latter used to mark the cells overexpressing CRM1). GFP-positive cells (arrowheads) showed essentially no nuclear accumulation of Smad1, whereas neighboring GFP-negative cells displayed normal Smad1 nuclear translocation. Transfection of GFP alone did not interfere with Smad1 nuclear translocation (data not shown).This experiment establishes that BMP-4 stimulates Smad1 nuclear enrichment mainly through suppression of its nuclear export. To ascertain whether TGF-β pathway R-Smad proteins such as Smad3 are also subject to CRM1-mediated nuclear export, we also overexpressed CRM1 in Mv1Lu cells in an attempt to inhibit the TGF-β-induced nuclear translocation of Smad3 (Fig. 4C, part 2). Again, GFP was cotransfected as a CRM1 expression marker. Without TGF-β, Smad3 was distributed throughout the cells, and this profile was not affected by CRM1 expression (upper panels,arrowheads). After TGF-β stimulation, Smad3 was completely localized inside the nucleus, and this nuclear accumulation was not disrupted by CRM1 overexpression either (lower panels,arrowheads). Additionally, we did not observe any LMB-induced Smad3 nuclear accumulation in Mv1Lu cells (data not shown). Since the anti-Smad3 antibody used for the immunostaining also recognizes Smad2, the above observations apply to Smad2. This suggests that, among the R-Smad proteins, only the BMP pathway Smad proteins are subject to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. To define the NES responsible for Smad1 nuclear export, we scanned the Smad1 sequence and noticed a leucine-rich NES-like motif near its C terminus:LTKMCTIRM (amino acids 406–414). In conformity to the classical Rev NES, this motif contains four properly spaced large hydrophobic residues (underlined). Sequence alignment showed that it is fairly conserved among R-Smad proteins as well as Co-Smad proteins (Fig.5A). Interestingly, this motif is poorly conserved in the I-Smad proteins such as Smad6 and Smad7, which is consistent with the preferential localization of Smad7 within the nucleus in the resting state (16Itoh S. Landstrom M. Hermansson A. Itoh F. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E ten Dijke P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29195-29201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To establish the nuclear export functions of this motif, we fused it to GST and microinjected the purified fusion protein into the nuclei of NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5B). As a control, we also injected GST-Rev NES (GST fused to the NES from the human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein). As expected, Rev NES induced complete nuclear exclusion of GST (Fig. 5B, panels 1 and 2). The putative Smad1 NES caused a similar nuclear exclusion of GST, indicating that in this assay, it was as functional as the Rev NES (Fig. 5B, panels 3 and 4). In contrast, mutations of the first two large hydrophobic residues to alanines (L406TKM409→ A406TKA409), shown previously to abrogate the export abilities of NESs (8Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), eliminated its ability to exclude GST from the nucleus (Fig. 5B, panels 5 and6). To prove that the identified NES is responsible for Smad1 nuclear export observed in vivo, we expressed the Smad1 NES mutant (L406TKM409 → A406TKA409) in BOSC cells and monitored its distribution (Fig. 5C). Impressively, the NES mutation converted Smad1 into a mostly nuclear protein even in the absence of ligand stimulation, confirming that the identified NES also mediates Smad1 nuclear exclusion in vivo. To investigate the roles of the NLS and NES in Smad1 transcriptional activation, we studied reporter gene activation profiles of the Smad1 NLS and NES mutants (Fig.6). We transfected various Smad1 constructs together with a Smad1/Smad5-specific 3GC2-luciferase reporter (18Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) into Mv1Lu cells. Consistent with previous results, expression of FLAG-WT Smad1 induced a 3-fold increase in reporter gene activity over the control without ligand and a 7-fold increase with BMP activation. GFP-Smad1 expression conferred similar increases, suggesting that a fusion of GFP with Smad1 does not grossly interfere with its normal functionality. Introduction of mutations into the NLS caused moderate (NLSmut1) to severe (NLSmut2) reductions in Smad1 transcriptional activation, consistent with the moderate to severe defects these mutants displayed in ligand-induced nuclear import (Fig.2). The deletion mutant (NLSmut2) showed essentially background levels of transcription. In comparison, disruption of the Smad1 NES (NESmut) lowered both basal and ligand-induced reporter activities by ∼40–60%. Thus, despite the fact that NESmut was largely localized in the nucleus in the absence of BMP stimulation (Fig. 5C) and that we could not detect additional nuclear translocation after BMP addition (data not shown), we infer that a small pool of NESmut must either pre-exist in the cytoplasm or move from the nucleus to the cytosol to respond to the BMP stimulation and become phosphorylated by activated BMP receptor. These results indicate that both the NLS and NES of Smad1 are required for optimal transcriptional activation, although mutating the NLS motif is apparently more disruptive. To ascertain whether the lowered transcriptional activities of the Smad1 NLS and NES mutants are due to defective complex formation with Smad4 or abnormal DNA-binding abilities, we carried out Smad1 gel mobility shift assays with the 9xGCCG probe (Fig.7), shown previously to be a direct DNA-binding target of the Smad1-Smad4 complex (15Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We used whole cell lysates from COS-7 cells cotransfected with Smad4 and Smad1 that were treated with BMP-4 prior to cell lysis. Smad1 alone (Fig. 7, lane 1) induced only background levels of the gel shifting Smad-DNA complex, similar to the control lysate from untransfected COS cells (data not shown), indicating that complex formation with Smad4 is necessary for efficient DNA binding. In combination with Smad4, both WT Smad1 and GFP-Smad1 generated similar gel shift profiles (Fig. 7,lanes 2 and 3), again demonstrating that GFP-Smad1 is functionally equivalent to WT Smad1. Supershifting with anti-Smad1 and anti-Smad4 antibodies caused retardation of the shifted bands, confirming the presence of both Smad1 and Smad4 in the complex (Fig. 7, lanes 4 and 5). Both the NLS deletion mutant (NLSmut2) and the NES mutant produced shifting and supershifting DNA binding profiles that were indistinguishable from those of WT Smad1 (Fig. 7, lanes 6–11), demonstrating that their lowered transcriptional activities are not due to an inability to form ligand-dependent DNA-binding complexes with Smad4. The major result of this study is that Smad1 contains an N-terminal NLS and a C-terminal NES. In the absence of ligand, Smad1 was found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus and rapidly accumulated in the nucleus after BMP stimulation. Addition of LMB, an inhibitor of nuclear export, induced nuclear accumulation of Smad1; and overexpression of CRM1, the receptor for nuclear export, resulted in re-localization of Smad1 to the cytoplasm. Mutations in the NLS disrupted ligand-induced nuclear accumulation of Smad1, whereas the NES mutation caused Smad1 to be localized in the nucleus even under resting conditions. Reporter gene activation assays demonstrated that both the NLS and NES were required for optimal transcriptional activation by Smad1. Strikingly, constitutive nuclear accumulation of the Smad1 NES mutant did not translate into higher basal transcriptional activity, suggesting that nuclear targeting per se is not sufficient for Smad1 activation. We conclude that Smad1 is under constant nucleocytoplasmic shuttling conferred by its NLS and NES and that its accumulation in the nucleus after ligand-induced phosphorylation represents an inhibition of nuclear export as well as enhancement of import. The basic NLS is highly conserved among all R-Smad proteins and has been shown previously to mediate TGF-β-induced nuclear import of Smad3 (9Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7853-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Additionally, since the Smad1 NLS contains more lysine residues compared with the Smad3 NLS (KKLKKKKversus KKLKKTG), it more closely resembles the classical T-antigen NLS. This implies that BMP pathway Smad proteins may possess a stronger NLS than those in the TGF-β pathway. The Smad1 NES is fairly conserved among R-Smad and Co-Smad proteins, which implies that it might also be functional in Smad2 and Smad3. However, no LMB-induced nuclear enrichment has been observed for endogenous Smad2 or Smad3 in HaCaT cells and Mv1Lu cells (13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). 2Z. Xiao, N. Watson, C. Rodriguez, and H. F. Lodish, unpublished observation. Consistently, CRM1 overexpression was able to override the ligand-induced nuclear import of only Smad1, but not of Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 4C), indicating that the NES may be active only in BMP-specific R-Smad proteins, but not in TGF-β-specific R-Smad proteins. Correspondingly, in the crystal structures of the Smad2 and Smad4 MH2 domains (19Shi Y. Hata A. Lo R.S. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1997; 388: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), the NES region has a high degree of hydrophobicity, suggesting restricted surface accessibility. We speculate that Smad1 contains an exposed NES motif and displays less structural conservation in this region with Smad2 and Smad4. Interestingly, Smad1 contains an additional C-terminal sequence (L444QWLDKVLTQM454) that resembles an NES just downstream of the identified functional NES (amino acids 406–414). However, mutations of the first two leucines to alanines in this second motif did not lead to Smad1 nuclear accumulation (data not shown); and thus, this second putative NES is probably nonfunctional. Smad4 has previously been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Pierreux C.E. Nicolás F.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9041-9054Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that R-Smad proteins such as Smad1 also undergo the same dynamic movements even without ligand stimulation. This offers an alternative pathway of down-regulation of nuclear R-Smad proteins besides ubiquitin-mediated degradation (1Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is presumably a much more efficient way to regulate their activities. It is not clear whether Smad1 undergoes dephosphorylation before being targeted for nuclear export. Nuclear export of yeast Hog1 MAPK coincides with its dephosphorylation, but this dephosphorylation is not required for nuclear export (20Mattison C.P. Ota I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1229-1235PubMed Google Scholar). It will be of great interest to investigate whether Smad1 dephosphorylation is a prerequisite for its nuclear export. Although endogenous Smad1 and Smad4 are both primarily cytoplasmic, transient overexpression of Smad1 leads to a partial nuclear profile, whereas overexpressed Smad4 is still mostly excluded from the nucleus (12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be explained by the relative strength and weakness of their respective NLSs. The Smad4 NLS motif is probably weaker than the Smad1 NLS since the Smad4 NLS is interrupted by an acidic residue in the middle (KKLKKKK (Smad1)versus KKLKEKK (Smad4)) and is followed by two more acidic residues after the basic motif (KKLKKKKGA(Smad1) versus KKLKEKKDE (Smad4)), both of which could diminish its import efficacy. BMP treatment induced rapid and complete nuclear accumulation of Smad1. This could be achieved through either enhanced NLS function or repressed NES function. Since the Smad1 NLS appears to be active even in the absence of BMP stimulation as revealed by LMB-induced nuclear enrichment of Smad1, we favor the latter scenario. However, since BMP-4 induced more complete nuclear accumulation of endogenous Smad1 in C2C12 cells than did LMB (Fig.4A), ligand stimulation may lead to both activation of nuclear import and suppression of nuclear export. Enhancement of nuclear import may stem from increased exposure of the Smad1 NLS in response to BMP activation. A similar mechanism has been proposed for the ligand-induced nuclear translocation of Smad3 (10Xiao Z. Liu X. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23425-23428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, inhibition of Smad1 nuclear export may be due to masking or sequestration of its NES. It has been previously shown that Smad4 achieves nuclear translocation by masking of its central linker NES through complex formation with R-Smad proteins (12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We propose that the same mechanism, i.e. ligand-induced interaction between Smad1 and Smad4, could also mask the Smad1 NES, which is in the MH2 domain. This is consistent with the notion that oligomerization between R-Smad and Co-Smad proteins occurs through their homologous MH2 domains (21Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, it is equally conceivable that ligand-induced phosphorylation of Smad1, which targets its C-terminal serine residues, may somehow directly alter the conformation of the NES due to physical proximity and cause its sequestration. This scenario seems more likely in light of the fact that even overexpressed Smad1 achieves quantitative nuclear import upon ligand activation in the absence of Smad4 coexpression. The Smad1 mutant with a nonfunctional NES is nuclear in both the presence and absence of ligand stimulation. Surprisingly, such nuclear localization not only failed to lead to higher basal transcriptional activity, but also caused a reduction in its ability to drive reporter gene activation both in the basal state and after BMP stimulation. This indicates that simple nuclear targeting of Smad1, without proper C-terminal phosphorylation and possibly other ligand-induced modifications, does not translate into higher transcriptional activity. This is similar to the case of disrupting the Smad4 NES sequence, which also causes constitutive nuclear accumulation, but fails to induce higher reporter gene activity (12Watanabe M. Masuyama N. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Based on our findings, we propose a model to explain the distribution of endogenous Smad1 before and after ligand activation. In the resting state, the NES is fully operational, whereas the NLS is only partially functional; and this results in a preferential steady-state cytoplasmic localization of Smad1 even though the protein is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Upon BMP-induced phosphorylation, Smad1 undergoes a conformational change and forms a complex with Smad4; somehow, this masks the Smad1 C-terminal NES while fully activating the NLS, thus leading to complete nuclear accumulation of the Smad1-Smad4 complex. The eventual dissolution of the Smad1-Smad4 complex inside the nucleus, with or without Smad1 dephosphorylation, will reset the pathway to the basal state by exposing the Smad1 NES and causing its nuclear export.

It consists of a Rho GTPase binding domain and three FH domains (Fig.1A). We previously demonstrated that mDia1 and mDia2 were required for cytokinesis, stress fiber formation, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor, that Src-tyrosine kinase bound to FH1 (the proline-rich region of mDia), and that Src was required for all known mDia functions (10Tominaga T.

FH proteins in other species are known to be essential for cytokinesis (11Wasserman S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and a mutation in hDia2 has been reported to cause human primary ovarian failure through a defect in oogenesis (12Bione S.

However, mDia remains poorly understood at the mechanistic level, especially with regard to its role in cytokinesis. Furthermore, the potential involvement of mDia in cell adhesion and migration has not been investigated, even though such a role is suggested by the fact that Src and focal adhesion kinase are important for cell adhesion signaling and the regulation of focal adhesion turnover (13Clark E.A.

To further understand the mechanisms of mDia action, we searched for additional mDia binding partners. Here we report a new mDia-binding protein, diaphanous-interacting protein (DIP), that appears to be involved in stress fiber formation in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway and that may also participate in cell adhesion. To identify proteins that interact with active mDia2, the yeast strain HF7c was co-transformed with mDia2 fused into the pGBT9 Gal-4 DNA binding domain and a HeLa cDNA library fused with the Gal4 activation domain (CLONTECH) and screened as previously described (10Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). One positive clone (2Y1) was found to be expressed ubiquitously by Northern blotting. This clone was used to screen both a fetal human cDNA library (Invitrogen) and a human placenta cDNA library (Life Technologies, Inc.) to obtain a full-length DIP cDNA. Recombinant cDNA expression vectors were made by standard techniques and confirmed by sequencing. Anti-DIP antibodies were raised in rabbits against a glutatione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein (amino acids 1–350; called anti-DIP-N) and against a peptide (amino acids 88–101; called anti-DIP-P) and then affinity-purified using standard procedures. Immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) were carried out using the cell extracts solubilized in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer as previously described (16Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Antibodies used in IP or IB were anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies (3F10 for IP and 12CA5 for IB; both from Roche Molecular Biochemicals), an anti-Flag antibody (M2 (Sigma) and anti-myc antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies)), and anti-Src antibodies (SRC-2 (Santa Cruze) for IP, clone 327 (Oncogene) for IB, and clone 29 (generously provided by Dr. H. Kawakatsu, University of California, San Francisco, CA; Ref. 17Kawakatsu H. Sakai T. Takagaki Y. Shinoda Y. Saito M. Okada M.K. Yano J. J. Biol.

The GST pull-down assay was performed by mixing the GST fusion proteins and 35S-labeled in vitro-translated (IVT) proteins using the TNT coupled Transcription/Translation system (Promega). After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads and bound materials were washed extensively and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. NIH3T3, COS7, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse and 10% fetal calf sera. For microinjection experiments, serum-deprived HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.1% fetal calf serum for 24 h before injection. Cells were microinjected with an Eppendorf semiautomated injection system as previously described (10Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The microinjected plasmid concentration was 50 mg/ml in filtrated half-phosphate-buffered saline. Three hours later, cells were fixed and stained. For transient expression experiments, HeLa and COS7 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were fixed after 20 h and stained with the first antibodies anti-DIP, anti-mDia1 (10Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), anti-Src (SRC-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and anti-vinculin (VIN-11-5; Sigma), followed by Alexa Fluor 488 (green)- or 594 (red)-labeled secondary antibody. Immunofluorescent images were obtained with a Leica confocal microscope or an Olympus fluorescent microscope with a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu). To identify novel mDia-binding proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a HeLa cell library with an active mDia2 fragment as bait (Fig. 1A, arrow). One positive clone (2Y1; Fig. 1A, arrow) arising from this screen appeared to be truncated at its 5′ end. This clone was therefore used as a hybridization probe to isolate a full-length clone (P3) from brain and placenta libraries. The P3 clone encoded a putative 722-amino acid protein that we named DIP. The 2Y1 and P3 clones differed at their C-terminal regions and appeared to represent splice variants of the same protein. The full-length protein has an N-terminal fyn-like Src homology 3 (SH3) domain (amino acids 1–58) followed by a bipartite nuclear localization signal (amino acids 171–192), a proline-rich domain (PRD; amino acids 170–249), and a leucine-rich domain (LRD; amino acids 505–717; Fig. 1A). While this work was in progress, Sano et al. (18Sano K. Hayakawa A. Piao J.H. Kosaka Y. Nakamura H. Blood. 2000; 95: 1066-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported the identification of a leukemia-related protein called AF3p21 (GenBankTM accession number HSU 04737) with a sequence that is identical to our P3 clone. DIP mRNA (3.0 kilobases) was expressed in all tissues examined but was highly expressed in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver (Fig. 1B). In addition, by probing immunoblots with two different DIP-specific antisera, we were able to identify a specifically immunoreactive protein of ∼80 kDa in lysates from several different cell lines (Fig.1C). This broad expression pattern resembles that of mDia1 but is distinct from that of mDia2, the expression of which is largely confined to testis and cancer cell lines (10Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). When an active subregion of mDia1 (10Tominaga T. Sahai E. Chardin P. McCormick F. Courtneidge S.A. Alberts A.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) was used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the cells died, as previously reported for Bni1, a yeast homologue of mDia (19Evangelista M. Blundell K. Longtine M.S. Chow C.J. Adames N. Pringle J.R. Peter M. Boone C. Science. 1997; 276: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar,20Imamura H. Tanaka K. Hihara T. Umikawa M. Kamei T. Takahashi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2745-2755Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This may be because mDia1 has more proline-rich repeats than mDia2. Therefore, we performed subsequent experiments using mDia1 as the partner of DIP. To confirm that DIP interacts with mDia, and to determine the nature of that interaction, we first used a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig.2A, a, lane 2, C, the DIP SH3 domain alone bound strongly to the region of mDia that includes the FH1 domain (mDia1 region 2; Fig. 1A). The combination of the SH3 domain and PRD domain of DIP interacted weakly with the same FH1 domain-containing portion of mDia1 (lane 4, C), but this interaction was significant compared with other parts of mDia1 (lane 4, B and D). We observed a similarly weak but significant interaction between the LRD domain of DIP and the C-terminal portion of mDia (mDia region 3; Fig.1A), which contains the FH2 domains (lane 5,D). To further confirm the interaction between DIP and mDia in mammalian cells, we transiently co-expressed HA-tagged DIP with Flag-tagged mDia1 in COS cells and assayed for complex formation by IP and IB (Fig. 2B). Flag-mDia1 was detected in full-length DIP (Fig. 2B, lane 3)- and ΔLRD DIP (lane 5)-containing lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-HA Antibody (Ab). Because the PRD of DIP contained potential Grb2 binding sequences, we next tested whether DIP was physically associated with Grb2. A GST pull-down assay demonstrated a strong interaction between Grb2 and PRD of DIP (Fig. 2C, a). Furthermore, in vivo interaction between these two proteins was detected by IP (Fig. 2D). DIP but not ΔPRD. DIP was co-precipitated with Grb2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). We also found evidence for an intramolecular interaction between the SH3 region and PRD of DIP using both the yeast two-hybrid system and GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Accordingly, we constructed a schematic model for binding of DIP to mDia1 and Grb2 (Fig. 2E). A similar series of experiments suggested that mDia2 binds to DIP in the same manner (data not shown). To investigate the subcellular localization pattern of DIP in mammalian cells, we transiently expressed GFP-DIP in HeLa cells and simultaneously detected endogenous mDia1 by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-mDia1 Ab. As shown in Fig.3A, a, DIP was largely co-localized with mDia, especially at the cell periphery. Endogenous DIP was stained with anti-DIP-P Ab in late mitotic cells (Fig.3A, b). Pronounced DIP immunoreactivity was observed at membrane ruffles. We also examined whether DIP could compete with Src for binding to mDia. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with DIP and vSrc. Unexpectedly, DIP was consistently found to be co-localized with vSrc. Furthermore, co-expression of vSrc and DIP produced a unique morphology at the cell periphery compared with vSrc overexpression alone (Fig.3B, a and b). We next biochemically examined the Src activation by DIP (Fig. 3B, c). DIP overexpression with vSrc induced the increased amount of active Src detected by clone 29 monoclonal Ab (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 4). These data suggest that DIP acts in concert with vSrc to influence cell adhesion and cell spreading. To evaluate the role of DIP in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway, we investigated stress fiber formation induced by mDia. Serum-starved HeLa cells were microinjected with plasmids containing GFP-DIP and active mDia1 cDNAs (Fig.4). Stress fiber formation was observed in the cells co-expressing active mDia1 and full-length DIP (Fig. 4,a and b). However, it was less pronounced in the cells co-expressing mDia1 and either ΔSH3-DIP or ΔPRD-DIP (Fig. 4,c and d) and was completely suppressed in cells co-expressing mDia1 and a mutant form of DIP lacking the SH3 to PRD domain (LRD-DIP; Fig. 4e). The attenuation of the stress fiber formation was restored by co-expression with ΔLDR-DIP (Fig.4f). These data suggest that DIP, acting through its SH3 and PRD domains, is important for stress fiber formation in the downstream portion of the Rho signaling pathway. In this study, we identified a new binding partner of mDia, DIP, and showed that this protein plays an important role in stress fiber formation. We further suggest that DIP is important for focal adhesion formation as part of a mDia-Src pathway on the basis of our observation that overexpression of vSrc with DIP induced morphological changes at focal contacts and activation of vSrc. Given the large body of data suggesting that Src is important for focal adhesion turnover (13Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 14Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), we think that a more detailed examination of Rho-mDia-Src pathway will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of focal adhesion turnover and cell migration. A rat homologous protein of DIP (neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP)-interacting SH3 protein; 78% identity at the amino acid level) with an mRNA expression pattern that was restricted to brain and testis and was distinct from that of DIP, was recently identified by Fukuoka et al.(21Fukuoka M. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Fukami K. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). N-WASP-interacting SH3 protein was reported to induce microspike formation on epidermal growth factor-stimulated actin polymerization in a Cdc42-independent manner. N-WASP-induced actin polymerization mediated through the Arp2/3 complex is well established (22Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), and this event can occur independently from Cdc42 (23Kato M. Miki H. Imai K. Nonoyama S. Suzuki T. Sasakawa C. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27225-27230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, N-WASP-interacting SH3 protein was proposed to be able to activate the Arp2/3 complex through an N-WASP-independent pathway (21Fukuoka M. Suetsugu S. Miki H. Fukami K. Endo T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The relevance of N-WASP interaction to N-WASP-interacting SH3 protein function therefore remains to be established. Grb2 has also been proposed to enhance Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization (24Carlier M.F. Nioche P. Broutin-L'Hermite I. Boujemaa R. Le Clainche C. Egile C. Garbay C. Ducruix A. Sansonetti P. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21946-21952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the N-terminal region of DIP is important for stress fiber formation. Although mDia is reported to participate in actin polymerization through the binding of its FH1 domain to profilin (7Watanabe N. Madaule P. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Kakizuka A. Saito Y. Nakao K. Jockusch B.M. Narumiya S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3044-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), the presence of profilin alone is not sufficient for the elongation of actin filaments to occur (22Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Therefore, Grb2 and Arp2/3 may participate in rapid actin polymerization and stress fiber formation in the downstream portion of the Rho-mDia pathway by interacting with the DIP N terminus. Finally, Grb2 is well recognized as an important signaling molecule, especially in adhesion signaling through Src (13Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2816) Google Scholar, 14Fincham V.J. Frame M.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 15Schoenwaelder S.M. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) and in Ras signaling (25Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose the existence of cross-talk between the Rho-mDia-DIP and Ras-PI3 kinase-Rac pathways (26Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) mediated by DIP-Grb2 binding. Future studies should aim to clarify the coordinated signaling events regulated by Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42) during cell adhesion and migration. We thank Dr. Arthur S. Alberts (Van Andel Research Institute) for critical discussion, Dr. Hiromichi Shirataki (Dokkyo University School of Medicine) for support of this study, Dr. Kazuhisa Nakayama (Tsukuba University) and his laboratory members for help in the confocal microscopy study, and Dr. Makoto Tominaga (Mie University School of Medicine) for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2043451478,"Rho family GTPases are critical molecular switches that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell function. In the current study, we investigated the involvement of Rho GTPases in regulating neuronal survival using primary cerebellar granule neurons. Clostridium difficile toxin B, a specific inhibitor of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, induced apoptosis of granule neurons characterized by c-Jun phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and nuclear condensation. Serum and depolarization-dependent survival signals could not compensate for the loss of GTPase function. Unlike trophic factor withdrawal, toxin B did not affect the antiapoptotic kinase Akt or its target glycogen synthase kinase-3β. The proapoptotic effects of toxin B were mimicked by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, a selective inhibitor of Rac/Cdc42. Although Rac/Cdc42 GTPase inhibition led to F-actin disruption, direct cytoskeletal disassembly withClostridium botulinum C2 toxin was insufficient to induce c-Jun phosphorylation or apoptosis. Granule neurons expressed high basal JNK and low p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activities that were unaffected by toxin B. However, pyridyl imidazole inhibitors of JNK/p38 attenuated c-Jun phosphorylation. Moreover, both pyridyl imidazoles and adenoviral dominant-negative c-Jun attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that JNK/c-Jun signaling was required for cell death. The results indicate that Rac/Cdc42 GTPases, in addition to trophic factors, are critical for survival of cerebellar granule neurons.

The three most studied Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs, are best known as regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar). However, Rho GTPases also modulate other critical cell functions including cell cycle progression (2Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar), gene transcription (3Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar), and cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion (4Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26044-26050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Recently, Rho GTPases have also been shown to influence cell survival. For example, Rho GTPases up-regulate expression of prosurvival Bcl-2 family members in T cells and epithelial cells (6Gomez J. Martinez C. Giry M. Garcia A. Rebollo A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2793-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7Fiorentini C. Matarrese P. Straface E. Falzano L. Fabbri A. Donelli G. Cossarizza A. Boquet P. Malorni W. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of Rho GTPases with cytotoxic necrotizing factor protects epithelial cells from UV-induced apoptosis (8Fiorentini C. Fabbri A. Matarrese P. Falzano L. Boquet P. Malorni W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Similarly, constitutively active Rac inhibits apoptosis induced by various stimuli in Rat1 fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and hematopoietic cells (9Boehm J.E. Chaika O.V. Lewis R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28632-28636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5892-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Nishida K. Kaziro Y. Satoh T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the prosurvival effects of Rho GTPases are cell type- and paradigm-specific. For example, overexpression of Rac sensitizes NIH-3T3 fibroblasts to serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis (12Embade N. Valerón P.F. Aznar S. López-Collazo E. Lacal J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4347-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, constitutively active Rho GTPase mutants enhance susceptibility of CHO cells expressing a chimeric CD4-Fas receptor to Fas-induced apoptosis (13Subauste M.C. Von Herrath M. Benard V. Chamberlain C.E. Chuang T.-H. Chu K. Bokoch G.M. Hahn K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9725-9733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Thus, in non-neuronal cells Rho GTPases can display either prosurvival or proapoptotic functions. In contrast to non-neuronal cells, comparatively few studies have investigated a role for Rho GTPases in neuronal survival. Furthermore, the available data suggest that neuronal cell type-specific responses may exist. For example, dominant-negative mutants of Rac and Cdc42 protect sympathetic neurons from nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis by suppressing activation of apoptosis signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1 (14Bazenet C.E. Mota M.A. Rubin L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3984-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Kanamoto T. Mota M. Takeda K. Rubin L.L. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Bazenet C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting that Rho GTPases can function as upstream activators of stress-activated protein kinase cascades during neuronal apoptosis. On the other hand, recent data obtained from primary cortical neurons suggest that Rho GTPases may also mediate prosurvival signaling in some neuronal cell types. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (statins) decrease the plasma membrane localization of Rho GTPases and induce cortical neuron apoptosis (16Tanaka T. Tatsuno I. Uchida D. Moroo I. Morio H. Nakamura S. Noguchi Y. Yasuda T. Kitagawa M. Saito Y. Hirai A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2852-2859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results utilizing statins to induce apoptosis were also reported recently for rat brain neuroblasts (17Garcia-Roman N. Alvarez A.M. Toro M.J. Montes A. Lorenzo M.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These latter findings provideindirect evidence that Rho GTPases may play a prosurvival function in some types of neurons. In the current study, we utilized clostridial toxins, enzymes that covalently modify and inactivate Rho family GTPases in a highly specific manner (18Busch C. Aktories K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to investigate if Rho GTPases regulate the survival of primary rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs). Clostridial toxins provide a distinct advantage over statins in that they directly modify Rho GTPases rather than affecting mevalonate synthesis, a precursor required for the isoprenylation of many cellular proteins besides Rho GTPases. CGNs isolated from early postnatal rats provide a well characterized in vitro model to study neuronal apoptosis in that their survival requires serum-derived and activity-dependent (membrane depolarization) signals (19D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar,20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results show that inhibition of Rho GTPases, specifically Rac/Cdc42, promotes apoptosis of CGNs maintained in culture medium containing serum and depolarizing potassium, indicating that serum-derived and calcium-dependent survival signals cannot compensate for the loss of GTPase function. Moreover, apoptosis occurs independently of actin cytoskeletal disruption and requires phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun. The data are the first to establish clearly a prosurvival function for Rho GTPases in a primary neuronal cell model. Clostridium difficile toxin B (21Von Eichel-Streiber C. Harperath U. Bosse D.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated at a density of 2.0 × 106 cells/ml in basal modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mml-glutamine, and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 µg/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cytosine arabinoside (10 µm) was added to the culture medium 24 h after plating to limit the growth of non-neuronal cells. Using this protocol, the cultures were ∼95–99% pure for granule neurons. In general, experiments were performed after 7 days in culture. Apoptosis was induced by either removing serum and decreasing the extracellular potassium concentration from 25 mm to 5 mm or by the direct addition of clostridial toxins to complete medium containing serum and 25 mm potassium. After induction of apoptosis as described above, CGNs were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and nuclei were stained with either Hoechst dye or DAPI. Cells were considered apoptotic if their nuclei were either condensed or fragmented. In general, ∼500 cells from at least two fields of a 35-mm well were counted. Data are presented as the percentage of cells in a given treatment group which were scored as apoptotic. Experiments were performed in triplicate. On day 5 in culture, CGNs were infected with either control adenovirus (adenoviral-CMV), adenoviral-CrmA, or adenoviral-DN-c-Jun each at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. After infection, cells were returned to the incubator for 48 h at 37 °C and 10% CO2. On day 7, the cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h with either vehicle (1 mg/ml BSA in PBS) or 500 pg/ml C. difficile toxin B. Apoptosis was quantified as described above. After incubation with clostridial toxins for the indicated times specified in the text, the treatment medium was aspirated, CGNs were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4), and cells were then placed on ice and scraped into lysis buffer (200 µl/35-mm well) containing 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 µm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 3 min, and the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using a commercially available protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical Co.). Aliquots (∼150 µg) of supernatant protein were diluted to a final concentration of 1 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and electrophoresed through 10–15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and processed for immunoblot analysis. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution (final dilution of 1:250–1:1,000) and incubated with the membranes for 1 h. Excess primary antibody was removed by washing the membranes three times in PBS-T. The blots were then incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in PBS-T (final dilution of 1:5,000–1:10,000) for 1 h and subsequently washed three times in PBS-T. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In some experiments, membranes were reprobed after stripping in 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 52 °C. The blots were rinsed twice in PBS-T and processed as above with a different primary antibody. Autoluminograms shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. CGNs were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips and were incubated with clostridial toxins ± pyridyl imidazole inhibitors as described in the text. After incubation, CGNs were fixed with paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized and blocked with PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. Cells were then incubated for ∼16 h at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) at a dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA. The primary antibody was aspirated, and the cells were washed five times with PBS. The cells were then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. CGNs were then washed five more times with PBS, and coverslips were adhered to glass slides in mounting medium (0.1%p-phenylenediamine in 75% glycerol in PBS). Fluorescent images were captured using a 63 × oil immersion objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope equipped with a Cooke sensicam deep-cooled CCD camera and a Slidebook software analysis program (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO). CGNs cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated glass coverslips were incubated for ∼24 h with either vehicle (BSA in PBS), toxin B, lethal toxin, or C2 toxin. After incubation, cells were fixed with paraformaldehye, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and incubated for 1 h with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and DAPI to stain F-actin and nuclei, respectively. Fluorescent images were captured under 63 × oil as described above. Results shown represent the means ± S.E. for the number (n) of independent experiments performed. Statistical differences between the means of unpaired sets of data were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance followed by apost hoc Dunnett's test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Primary rat CGNs require survival signals derived from depolarization-induced calcium influx, and to a lesser extent serum, to be maintained in culture (19D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 20Galli C. Meucci O. Scorziello A. Werge T.M. Calissano P. Schettini G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1172-1179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if signals originating from Rho family GTPases are also required for CGN survival, the function of these G proteins was compromised by incubation with clostridial toxins that covalently modify and inhibit specific Rho family members (18Busch C. Aktories K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Toxin B from C. difficileis a monoglucosyltransferase that glucosylates a critical threonine residue within the Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 GTPases (26Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of this site interferes with the ability of these G proteins to interact with their downstream effector proteins. Toxin B exhibits a very high degree of substrate specificity in that it glucosylates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, but not other small molecular weight GTPases such as Ras, Rab, or Arf (26Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Incubation of CGNs for ∼24 h with very low concentrations of toxin B (50–500 pg/ml) resulted in significant alterations in nuclear morphology with hallmarks of apoptotic cell death. Whereas cells incubated in the presence of vehicle displayed large intact nuclei, toxin B induced significant nuclear condensation and fragmentation (Fig. 1A). Identification of apoptotic nuclei by staining with Hoechst dye revealed a time- and concentration-dependent apoptotic mode of cell death after treatment with toxin B (Fig. 1B). Primary cultures of rat CGNs were remarkably sensitive to Rho GTPase inhibition with ∼80% of the cells undergoing apoptosis after 48 h of incubation with 500 pg/ml toxin B. This latter observation is particularly striking given that cell death occurred in the presence of serum and a depolarizing concentration of potassium. Consistent with previous results that indicate that CGN apoptosis induced by withdrawal of serum and potassium is blocked by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis (19D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), toxin B-induced apoptosis was similarly prevented by coincubation with either cycloheximide or actinomycin D (Fig. 1C). Thus, apoptosis of CGNs after inhibition of Rho family GTPases apparently requires the synthesis of proapoptotic proteins. Apoptotic cell death is orchestrated by the activation of a caspase cascade, proteases that cleave target proteins, including other caspases, at postaspartate residues (for review, see Ref. 27Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3237-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Of the caspase family members, caspase-3 is commonly regarded as an “executioner” caspase because its cleavage from an inactive promolecule to an active protease by upstream caspases usually signifies commitment to apoptosis (28Kumar S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2918) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activation is a key component of CGN apoptosis induced after the withdrawal of serum and potassium (30Eldadah B.A. Ren R.F. Faden A.I. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 179-186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a like manner, prolonged inhibition of Rho GTPase function with toxin B led to a significant activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, adenoviral infection of CGNs with the known caspase inhibitor, CrmA (31Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), significantly attenuated toxin B-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results indicate that inhibition of Rho family GTPases in CGNs evokes the activation of a caspase cascade that ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death. Previous work has demonstrated that apoptosis of CGNs after withdrawal of serum and potassium requires the activity of the transcription factor c-Jun (32Watson A. Eilers A. Lallemand D. Kyriakis J. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 751-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, deprivation of serum and potassium for 4 h resulted in a substantial accumulation of phosphorylated c-Jun in the nuclei of CGNs (Fig.3A, lower panels) and an overall increase in total c-Jun (including several distinct phosphorylation variants with differing apparent mobilities) in cell lysates (Fig. 3B, first lane versus sixth lane). Inhibition of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 with toxin B for 6 h also resulted in significant increases in nuclear phospho-c-Jun (Fig.3A, upper panels) and in total c-Jun detected in cell lysates (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in accordance with the data presented in Fig. 1C, inhibitors of either protein or RNA synthesis essentially abolished the increase in c-Jun expression elicited by either toxin B or deprivation of serum and potassium (Fig.3C). Thus, apoptosis induced after either an inhibition of Rho family GTPase function or removal of trophic factors is associated with enhanced phosphorylation and expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor c-Jun. Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that has been shown to be downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in a prosurvival signaling pathway that is activated by both growth factors and integrins. The catalytic function of Akt is activated by phosphorylation on Ser-473 by upstream kinases (33Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 34Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). GSK3β is a putative downstream substrate of activated Akt known to play a proapoptotic role in neurons (25Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 35Hetman M. Cavanaugh J.E. Kimelman D. Xia Z. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2567-2574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of GSK3β on Ser-9 by Akt effectively inactivates the kinase activity of GSK3β and thereby inhibits its proapoptotic function (25Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 36Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Although withdrawal of serum and potassium from CGNs for 6 h promoted the dephosphorylation (inactivation) of Akt (Fig.4A, last lane) and corresponding dephosphorylation (activation) of GSK3β (Fig.4B, last lane), incubation with toxin B had no significant effect on the phosphorylation (i.e., activation) status of either kinase. These results indicate that Rho GTPases do not significantly regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt cell survival pathway in CGNs. Lethal toxin from C. sordellii is similar to toxin B in that it also has monoglucosyltransferase activity; however, these two toxins differ in their substrate specificities. Whereas toxin B glucosylates all three Rho family members (Rho, Rac, and Cdc42), Rho is not a substrate for lethal toxin which selectively modifies Rac and to a lesser extent Cdc42, as well as some other Ras subfamily members (18Busch C. Aktories K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 22Just I. Selzer J. Hofmann F. Green G.A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10149-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 37Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D.

The glucosylation of Rac and Cdc42 catalyzed by lethal toxin occurs on the same threonine residue as that modified by toxin B. An inevitable consequence of inhibiting Rho family GTPases is an eventual disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (26Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Accordingly, phalloidin staining of CGNs after 24 h of incubation with either toxin B or lethal toxin revealed a significant disruption of the cytoskeleton characterized by cell rounding and a perinuclear accumulation of F-actin aggregates (Fig.5, A–C). Similarly, incubation with C. botulinum C2 toxin, an ADP-ribosyltransferase that directly modifies F-actin (23Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), resulted in a nearly complete loss of F-actin staining (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, although incubation of CGNs with each of the above three toxins led to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, a significant number of condensed nuclei were only observed with toxin B or lethal toxin, but not C2 toxin (Fig. 5). In a manner analogous to toxin B, selective inhibition of Rac/Cdc42 with lethal toxin elicited acute increases in both nuclear staining for phospho-c-Jun (Fig. 6A) and total c-Jun detected in cell lysates (Fig. 6B). Lethal toxin also induced caspase-3 cleavage (data not shown), and prolonged incubation of CGNs with either toxin B or lethal toxin resulted in a similar degree of apoptosis (∼45% apoptosis after 24 h) (Fig.6C). In contrast, specific inhibition of either Rho (withC. botulinum C3 fusion toxin (24Barth H. Hofmann F. Olenik C. Just I. Aktories K. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or Rho kinase (with Y27632 (38Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar)) did not enhance c-Jun phosphorylation or induce CGN apoptosis (data not shown). Furthermore, direct disruption of F-actin with either C2 toxin, cytochalasin D, or latrunculin A was also insufficient to induce either c-Jun phosphorylation/expression (Fig.6B and data not shown) or apoptosis (Fig. 6C and data not shown). These results indicate that a selective inhibition of Rac/Cdc42 function is entirely sufficient to evoke CGN apoptosis independently of Rho inactivation. Furthermore, the apoptosis induced after inhibition of Rac/Cdc42 also occurs independently of actin cytoskeletal disruption. To determine if the increase in c-Jun phosphorylation observed after acute inhibition of Rho family GTPases was caused by an enhancement of stress-activated protein kinase activity, the degree of JNK and p38 MAP kinase activation was assessed in CGNs. CGNs exhibited high basal JNK activity indicated by significant amounts of dually phosphorylated 46-kDa and 54-kDa isoforms of JNK which were only slightly increased by anisomycin exposure (Fig. 7A, first lane versus sixth lane). Incubation with toxin B for up to 6 h did not significantly increase the high basal JNK activity detected in CGNs (Fig. 7A). Relative to JNK activity, the basal p38 MAP kinase activity of CGNs was low as demonstrated by a substantial increase after anisomycin exposure (Fig.7B, first lane versus sixth lane). Yet, incubation of CGNs with toxin B did not result in a significant increase in the activation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig. 7B). Thus, inhibition of Rho family GTPases does not promote a detectable activation of stress-activated protein kinases in CGNs. Recently, others have reported that CGNs exhibi"

In the case of myosin, a variety of experimental results suggest that an isomerization associated with or following phosphate release leads to a swinging of a rigid lever arm contained within the regulatory domain (1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 2Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, additional rotation of this lever arm may occur with ADP release in at least some myosin isoforms (3Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25418-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In kinesin motors, the situation is even less clear. In the case of conventional kinesin, a carboxyl-terminal region of the motor domain, referred to as the “neck linker,” has been proposed to alter its orientation during the course of ATP binding and/or hydrolysis (6Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Studies with spectroscopic and electron-dense labels have led to a model in which the neck linker alternates between an ordered orientation, in which it is docked on the motor domain, and one that is disordered (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This order-to-disorder transition has been proposed to be dependent on the nature of the nucleotide in the active site. It is the basis for a recently proposed model in which cycles of docking and release of the neck linker cause the unattached kinesin head to find the next binding site on the microtubule (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that this model may not completely describe the mechanism of processive motility for kinesin. First, cryoelectron microscopy of gold-labeled, kinesin-decorated microtubules showed that in rigor and ADP, the neck linker assumes two distinct orientations, separate from that seen with ATP analogs (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). This suggests the presence of three discrete kinesin states, one induced by ATP and two by ADP or rigor, which is in fact consistent with recent kinetic studies of kinesin motor domain mutants (8Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Second, it is not clear at what point in the ATPase cycle the change in state of the neck linker occurs. Both AMP-PNP1 and ADP + aluminum fluoride immobilize the neck linker and appear to dock it onto the motor domain. However, AMP-PNP is thought to mimic an ATP-like state, whereas at least in the case of myosin, ADP + aluminum fluoride appear to mimic an ADP-Pi transition state (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 10Phan B.C. Cheung P. Stafford W.F. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Resolving these uncertainties will require a way of assessing, under transient kinetic conditions, the orientation of the kinesin-microtubule complex through the various intermediate states in its ATPase cycle. Such measures have largely relied upon light scattering. Unfortunately, the amplitude of the light scattering signal is not linearly related to the degree of association (11Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 276Google Scholar); is sensitive to the association state of the kinesin motor, rather than the orientation of the neck linker; and requires extensive signal averaging (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have addressed these issues by developing a strategy based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), utilizing donor and acceptor fluorophores on the kinesin motor and the microtubule. This study demonstrates that ATP induces two sequential structural transitions in microtubule-bound kinesin that precede dissociation and that the second of these two transitions reorients the neck linker from its rigor position. Furthermore, the results from this study are consistent with previous conclusions that the orientations of the neck linker in rigor and ADP are similar. The oligonucleotide primers used in the mutagenesis were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

The starting material for this mutagenesis was kindly provided by Dr. Ron Vale (University of California, San Francisco). It consisted of a clone of a cysteine-light mutant of the kinesin motor domain, containing the amino-terminal 349 residues, in which cysteines 7, 65, 168, 174, 294, and 330 were converted to alanine or serine and valine 333 (located in the neck linker) was converted to cysteine (7Rice S.

Mutagenesis of tryptophan 340 to phenylalanine was performed according to the QuikChange kit protocol, and the mutation was verified by DNA sequencing. The mutated plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue.

Microtubule-activated ATPase activity was assayed as previously described (14Huang T.G. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16493-16501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transient kinetic measurements were made in an Applied Photophysics SX.18 MV stopped-flow spectrometer with an instrument dead time of 1.2 ms. Complexes of kinesin and microtubules were formed by mixing the two with a slight excess of microtubules and incubating with apyrase as described (15Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dansyl and mant nucleotide fluorescence was excited at 295 nm (for tryptophan energy transfer), and the emission was monitored through a 455-nm cutoff filter (Omega Optical Inc.). For studies of phosphate release rates, complexes of microtubules and kinesin were made nucleotide-free with apyrase as described (10Phan B.C. Cheung P. Stafford W.F. Reisler E. Biophys.

Varying concentrations of ATP were placed in the other syringe, and both syringes contained phosphate MOP (100 µm7-methylguanosine and 0.5 units/ml purine-nucleoside phosphorylase). The rate of phosphate binding to the MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein was measured by setting the excitation monochromator to 425 nm and by using a 450-nm cutoff filter over the output photomultiplier. The absorbance profile of the 450-nm output filter demonstrated negligible transmission at the exciting wavelength. Crystallographic and electron microscopic docking models (16Hoenger A.

Given thatR o for tryptophan-dansyl donor-acceptor pairs is in the range of 20–25 Å (18Saraswat L.D. Lowey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17671-17679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to develop a measure of microtubule occupancy by utilizing a FRET approach. Our starting material for this study was a recombinant kinesin motor domain, consisting of the amino-terminal 349 residues, in which the reactive cysteines had been mutated. This cysteine-light mutant was characterized in a prior study (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) and was found to behave enzymatically in a manner similar to native kinesin. We then converted the single tryptophan residue (position 340) of this mutant kinesin to phenylalanine to prevent endogenous tryptophan fluorescence emission from confounding our experimental findings. The resulting construct (W340F) had k cat andK 0.5(MT) values that were similar to those of other monomeric constructs (59.7 ± 6.9 s−1 and 3.4 ± 1.5 µm, respectively). We labeled W340F at position 333 with IAEDANS and titrated its binding to microtubules by monitoring dansyl fluorescence. The dansyl fluorophore was excited by means of FRET from the remaining microtubule tryptophans. Fig.1shows a stoichiometric titration of nucleotide-free kinesin onto microtubules, assayed by monitoring FRET. Fluorescence emission demonstrated a kinesin concentration dependence that obeyed the following quadratic relationship (Equation 1), F=α(([Kin]+[MT]+Kd)−([Kin]+[MT]+Kd)2−4[Kin]·[MT])2Equation 1 where F is the FRET emission intensity and is assumed to depend linearly on the concentration of bound kinesin, [Kin] is the total kinesin concentration, [MT] is the microtubule concentration, K d is the dissociation constant for kinesin binding in the absence of nucleotide, and α is a scaling parameter for converting concentration of bound kinesin to fluorescence emission. As Fig. 1 demonstrates, data could be fit to Equation 1 withK d = 0.41 ± 0.20 µm and with a stoichiometry of ∼0.8:1. This demonstrates that the fluorescence signal depends linearly on microtubule occupancy and corresponds to a 41% enhancement of the dansyl emission when excited by FRET at 295 nm. Of note is that labeling at position 333 had no appreciable effect onk cat or K 0.5(MT). We have utilized this fluorescence signal change to examine the kinetics of nucleotide-induced dissociation of a rigor kinesin-microtubule complex. Dissociation of this complex at 20 °C by ADP produced a single phase in the fluorescence transient (Fig.2A), the rate of which showed a hyperbolic dependence on ligand concentration (Fig. 2 B,open circles). This curve could be superimposed on the rate of the light scattering transient versus [ADP] (Fig. 2 B, closed rectangles). This implies that the fluorescence decrease produced by ADP is due to dissociation of the motor domain from the microtubule, with consequent separation of fluorescent donor and acceptor. Similar studies were performed with ATP. The dansyl fluorescence transient at 20 °C consisted largely of a single phase, although at high ATP concentrations, evidence of a faster initial process could be seen (Fig. 3A,arrow). As in the case of ADP, a plot of rateversus [ATP] showed a hyperbolic dependence on ligand concentration. However, the rates of the fluorescence transient at high [ATP] were consistently faster than those obtained from light scattering or by monitoring phosphate release (Fig. 3 B). The disparity between the fluorescence and light scattering data could be explained by arguing that there is a faster phase in the fluorescence transient, apparent at higher ligand concentrations, that was averaged in the calculation of the overall rate for a single exponential fit. To evaluate this possibility, we repeated these studies at lower temperatures. At both 15 and 10 °C, the fluorescence transient produced by mixing dansyl-labeled W340F-microtubule complexes with ATP was monoexponential at low [ATP], but became biphasic at higher [ATP]. This is illustrated in Fig. 4(A–C). Fig. 4 A demonstrates that the transient produced by mixing W340F-microtubule complexes with 25 µmATP at 10 °C is well fit by a single exponential process. By contrast, when the experiment was repeated at 400 µm ATP, the resulting fluorescence transient is poorly fit by a single exponential process (Fig. 4 B), but is well fit by a double exponential process (Fig. 4 C). At this and higher ATP concentrations, the faster phase constituted 25–35% of the total signal amplitude. A plot of rate versus [ATP] at 10 °C revealed that the rate of the faster phase depended hyperbolically on [ATP], extrapolating to 367 ± 51 s−1 (Fig.4 D). The rate of the slower phase did not depend on [ATP] and matched the maximum rate of dissociation measured by light scattering (Fig. 4 D). The corresponding experiments with ADP, however, produced only a single phase in the transient following a brief lag (Fig. 5A), the rate of which depended hyperbolically on [ADP] (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Kinetics of microtubule tryptophan-to-neck linker AEDANS FRET produced by mixing with ADP at 10 °C.

However, it is also possible that this is simply due to a change in the local environment of the probe, leading to a reduction in probe quantum yield. If this is the case, repeating these experiments by directly exciting the dansyl fluorophore should produce a similar biphasic transient for ATP. Fig. 4 E demonstrates the transient produced by mixing AEDANS-labeled W340F + microtubules in the stopped-flow spectrometer with 4 mm ATP at 10 °C by directly exciting the AEDANS fluorophore at 336 nm. The transient consisted of only a single phase with a low amplitude following a lag of 7–8 ms. The rate constant for this transition is 34 s−1, essentially identical to the rate of dissociation at this temperature (Fig. 4 D). Mixing 2 µm dansyl-labeled W340F-microtubule complexes with 4 mm AMP-PNP produced a transient consisting of a single slow phase of decreasing fluorescence intensity with a rate of 1.5 s−1 at 10 °C and with an amplitude ∼20% of that seen with ATP (data not shown). Dissociation, monitored as light scattering, was also observed to occur at this rate (data not shown). The data presented so far indicate that the dansyl probe, when excited by energy transfer, is sensitive both to dissociation as well as to a step that precedes dissociation and that is specifically produced by ATP (Fig. 4, C and D). This faster step reflects a reorientation of the neck linker relative to the surface tryptophan residues and must be due either to the initial binding of ATP or to its subsequent hydrolysis. Both of these steps are quite rapid relative to dissociation (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed a series of energy transfer experiments at 20 and 10 °C in which binding of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP to W340F-microtubule complexes was monitored in the stopped-flow spectrometer by energy transfer from the microtubule tryptophans to the mant fluorophore. The resulting fluorescence transient consisted of a rising phase, corresponding to nucleotide binding in the catalytic site, followed by a falling phase (Fig.6A, upper curve). The amplitudes of these two phases are identical within 15%. Qualitatively similar results were seen with 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP (data not shown). By contrast, mixing microtubule-free W340F with either 2′-deoxy-mant-ADP or 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP produced no appreciable signal change when the sample was excited at 295 nm (Fig. 6 A,lower curve). This establishes that the signal change depicted in the upper transient in Fig. 6 A is due to energy transfer from microtubule tryptophans to the mant nucleotide. The falling phase of this transient showed a ligand concentration dependence that matched that produced by monitoring light scattering (Fig. 6 C). This establishes that the falling phase measures the dissociation step. The faster rising phase also fit a hyperbolic ligand concentration dependence, defining a maximum rate at 10 °C of 871 ± 67 s−1 (Fig. 6 B). Extrapolation of this curve to zero ligand concentration provides a measure of the rate of ATP release (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and was found to be 105 ± 11 s−1at 20 °C. This is consistent with earlier measures of the rate of microtubule-activated ATP release from kinesin at this temperature (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The maximum rate from this curve is at least 2.5-fold larger than the rate of the faster dansyl fluorescence transient and, unlike the latter, does not extrapolate to the origin at zero ligand concentration. This demonstrates that the initial phase of the dansyl fluorescence transient seen at 10 °C with ATP measures a step that occurs after ATP binding. Our results with microtubule tryptophan-to-neck linker AEDANS FRET reveal that ATP induces a reorientation of the neck linker relative to the microtubule in a step that precedes dissociation. Furthermore, the hyperbolic dependence of this rate on [ATP] and the extrapolation of this hyperbola to the origin at zero ligand concentration imply two things. First, the AEDANS FRET signal change monitors an irreversible step. Second, this step occurs after the initial isomerization produced by ATP binding, which is monitored by the mant-ATP fluorescence transient (Fig. 6 B). This, in turn, implies that either ATP hydrolysis or a second conformational change that immediately precedes hydrolysis reorients the neck linker when kinesin is attached to the microtubule. Direct measurements of the rate of hydrolysis using quenched-flow techniques at 25 °C have been limited by the rapidity of this step, and two separate estimates place it at ∼200 and >300 s−1 (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the low affinity of ATP and the high apparent second-order rate constant for ATP binding have been used to argue that hydrolysis could be much faster, at 1000–2000 s−1 (20Schief W.R. Howard J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that the AEDANS FRET signal change may not be due to ATP hydrolysis. First, AMP-PNP can also reorient the neck linker, albeit at a rate that is several hundredfold slower than for ATP (this work). Second, AMP-PNP binding to the microtubule-attached head of a kinesin dimer is able to accelerate release of mant-ADP from the second head at a rate that is 10-fold slower than for ATP (21Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Third, this acceleration of ADP release also occurs with a mutant of kinesin defective in ATP hydrolysis (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Finally, cryoelectron microscopic reconstructions of kinesin-decorated microtubules demonstrate that AMP-PNP docks the neck linker in a configuration identical to ADP + aluminum fluoride (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar), even though the latter is thought to induce a post-hydrolytic conformation (9Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 10Phan B.C. Cheung P. Stafford W.F. Reisler E. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 59: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These findings suggest instead a model in which the rapid reorientation of the neck linker is due to a second isomerization, one that follows the initial binding event monitored by mant-ATP (Fig. 6 B). We propose that this second isomerization produces a transition state that rapidly leads to hydrolysis and is in fact rate-limiting for hydrolysis. Earlier studies of the kinetics of binding of the ATP analog 1-N 6-etheno-ATP to myosin were also consistent with the idea that a second conformational change controls the rate of ATP hydrolysis (26Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11920-11929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our current work also suggests that this isomerization can be produced by AMP-PNP, but is much slower and less favorable energetically than with ATP. This would explain why the amplitude of the AMP-PNP-induced FRET transient is smaller than that with ATP. Previous kinetic studies of ATP binding to a kinesin-microtubule complex (12Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) were interpreted according to a model in which ATP binding leads to a conformational change, followed by hydrolysis: M·K + T ↔ M·K(T) ↔ M·K·T ↔ M·K·D·Pi, where M is microtubule, K is kinesin, T is ATP, D·Pi is hydrolysis products, and K(T) represents a collisional complex. However, these studies are consistent as well with our conclusion from this study, viz. that a second conformational change occurs in kinesin prior to ATP hydrolysis that is rate-limiting for the hydrolysis step (Equation 2),M·K+T↔K0M·K(T)↔K1M·K·T1↔K2M·K·T2→M·K·D·PiEquation 2 where K 0, K 1, andK 2 represent equilibrium constants. Binding of ATP produces an initial collisional complex (described by equilibrium constant K 0), followed by two sequential conformational changes (indicated by the subscripts 1 and 2). In this model, docking of the neck linker occurs with formation of the M·K·T2 state, and formation of this state is favored,e.g. K 2 is large when ATP is in the active site. What do states 1 and 2 look like? Our study does not provide direct evidence that would allow us to identify the nature of these conformational states. However, some insights come from molecular modeling studies of the kinesin-related protein Ncd (25Minehardt T.J. Cooke R. Pate E. Kollman P.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1151-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These propose that ATP binding leads to two structural transitions: movement of switch I to close the phosphate tube and movement of switch II to interact with nucleotide. Movement of switch II, in turn, has been proposed to lead to the power stroke in myosin and the docking of the neck linker in kinesin (reviewed in Refs. 1Geeves M.A. Holmes K.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 687-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar and 6Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). We suggest that binding of mant-ATP to the active site produces a set of local conformational changes that occur with a rate constant of 871 ± 67 s−1 at 10 °C and that are communicated down the length of the motor domain to the neck linker via changes in the structure of switch II. That this process of communication requires a discrete amount of time explains why the reorientation of the neck linker occurs more slowly (367 ± 51 s−1 at 10 °C). This would correspond to a 1.0–1.5-ms delay between the initial binding of ATP in the catalytic site and the subsequent movement of the neck linker. The ability to detect energy transfer requires that donor and acceptor remain within a certain distance of each other, which is determined by the value of R o, the Forster critical energy transfer distance. In the case of AEDANS-labeled K349, containing tryptophan at residue 340, we have measured R o to be 20.3–21.0 Å (data not shown). It seems likely thatR o for a microtubule tryptophan-AEDANS-labeled kinesin donor-acceptor pair would be in a similar range. This implies that during the kinesin mechanochemical cycle, the neck linker remains in relatively close proximity to the microtubule surface, at least until the motor domain dissociates. This is in contrast to myosin, where the regulatory domain/lever arm remains at some distance from the actin filament (3Jontes J.D. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Milligan R.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 4Whittaker M. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Smith J.E. Faust L. Milligan R.A. Sweeney H.L.

Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). It may also explain why the neck linker of K349 in the presence of AMP-PNP or ADP + aluminum fluoride remains disordered unless bound to the microtubule (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) since interactions between the neck linker and the microtubule surface may be necessary to stabilize the docked conformation. A review of the tubulin dimer structure in light of recent cryoelectron microscopic data (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2063-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is instructive since it may explain why ATP produces an initial fluorescence decrease that precedes dissociation. The tubulin dimer contains eight tryptophan residues, which precludes precise distance measurements by FRET. However, four of these residues, at position 407 in the α-subunit and positions 103, 346, and 407 in the β-subunit, lie within 40 Å of the position of the neck linker deduced from cryoelectron microscopic models, which we presume is within a value of 2 × R o (16Hoenger A. Thormahlen M. Diaz-Avalos R. Doerhoefer M. Goldie K.N. Muller J. Mandelkow E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1087-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 7, in which these tryptophan residues are depicted in red. Cryoelectron microscopy of a K349-microtubule complex with a gold label on the neck linker revealed label in a position ∼40° from the vertical protofilament axis in the presence of ADP + aluminum fluoride or AMP-PNP (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). When the tubulin dimer is viewed along the same orientation, the position of the gold label corresponds roughly to a region of the tubulin dimer relatively devoid of surface-exposed tryptophans (Fig. 7, blue asterisk). Thus, our kinetic studies support a model in which an ATP-induced isomerization moves the neck linker toward a position on the microtubule surface relatively distant from these four tryptophan residues and consistent with the cryoelectron microscopic reconstructions (7Rice S. Lin A.W. Safer D. Hart C.L. Naber N. Carragher B.O. Cain S.M. Pechatnikova E. Wilson-Kubalek E.M. Whittaker M. Pate E. Cooke R. Taylor E.W. Milligan R.A. Vale R.D. Nature. 1999; 402: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). By contrast, ADP binding did not produce the initial rapid decrease in FRET seen with ATP. This suggests that the neck linker in ADP and rigor assumes the same relative orientation with respect to these four tryptophan residues. This could be due to one of two possibilities: either the neck linker is ordered in ADP and rigor and assumes the same orientation in both cases, or it is equally disordered in both states. Finally, our work provides a new approach to measure the kinetics of the interactions of kinesin with the microtubule. Previous work has relied heavily on light scattering or turbidity measurements. However, the large dimensions of the microtubule relative to those of the kinesin monomer mean that dissociation produces a relatively small change in the radius of gyration (11Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1961: 276Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that for monomeric kinesin constructs, turbidity or light scattering changes produced by dissociation are relatively small and require extensive signal averaging. This is not the case with the approach used in our study since FRET efficiency is not affected by global changes in macromolecule geometry, but rather is sensitive to changes in orientation that occur in the vicinity of the fluorescent probes. The applicability of our approach is illustrated with processive dimeric kinesin, a motor that walks on the microtubule by a hand-over-hand mechanism and that does not completely dissociate during a processive run. Kinesin accomplishes processive movement by alternating between a singly attached and a doubly attached species. In this setting, the radius of gyration of the kinesin-microtubule complex may not change much through the course of a processive run, and light scattering may therefore not be able to monitor the kinetics of the transitions associated with processive movement. By contrast, the FRET signal developed in these studies should not be limited by these considerations. Furthermore, both of the FRET approaches used in this study provide high signal-to-noise, and we have demonstrated that at least one of these is linear (Fig. 1). This approach should be directly applicable to dimeric kinesin constructs and will be used in future studies in our laboratory to examine the kinetics of head-head interactions of processive kinesin motors.

A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). AR consists of three main regions: an N-terminal A/B region that contains AF-1, a highly conserved cysteine-rich DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) (3Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The LBD of AR is responsible for ligand binding and contains the interaction surfaces for dimerization. Recent progress in SR studies indicate that, in addition to contacting the basal transcriptional machinery directly, SRs may inhibit or enhance transcription by recruiting an array of coregulators (4Yeh S. Sampson E.R. Lee D.K. Kim E. Hsu C.L. Chen Y.L. Chang H.C. Altuwaijri S. Huang K.E. Chang C. J. Formos. Med. Assoc. 2000; 99: 885-894PubMed Google Scholar). Several coregulators that are associated with AR have been identified such as ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, ARA24, ARA160, Rb, BRCA1, Smad3, AIB1, and SRC1 (5Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of these coregulators can interact with either the C- or N-terminal of AR and enhance AR transactivation (14Yeh S. Kang H.Y.

While the physiological significance of these identified coregulators remains unclear, several studies suggest some of them may play important roles in SR-related diseases. For example, the overexpression of AIB1 has been linked to the risk of breast and ovarian cancer (15Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M. Guan X.Y. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar). Variable polyglutamine lengths within AR and AIB1 were also closely linked to the risk of prostate cancer (16Hsing A.W. Gao Y.T. Wu G. Wang X. Deng J. Chen Y.L. Sesterhenn I.A. Mostofi F.K.

Chang, submitted for publication. and ARA24 was associated with the variable polyglutamine lengths in the AR N-terminal domain that may have a role in Kennedy's Neuron disease (8Hsiao P.W. Lin D.L. Nakao R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20229-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both ARA55 and Smad3 have been suggested to function as bridges for cross-talk between transforming growth factor-β signaling and androgen/AR action (6Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y.

These examples suggest that AR and AR coregulators could play important roles in the development and progression of disease. Here we report the cloning and characterization of ARA267-α, a novel AR-associated protein that contains a Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, andTrithorax (SET) domain. 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dexamethasone, progesterone, 17β-estradiol (E2), Δ5-androstendiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were obtained from Sigma, and hydroxyflutamide was obtained from Schering. pSG5AR, pSG5ARA55, pSG5ARA54, and pSG5ARA70N (ARA70 N terminus) were constructed as described previously (3Chang C.

Erdos (Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health). The Smad3 expression plasmid was provided by Rik Derynck (University of California, San Francisco). We reconstructed the expression plasmid of CBP (provided by Richard H. Goodman, Vollum Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR) into the pCMV expression vector. pCMX-GAL4AR-C (AR DBD and LBD) and pCMX-VP16AR-N (AR N terminus) were constructed for mammalian two-hybrid assays (11Yeh S. Hu Y.C. Rahman M. Lin H.K. Hsu C.L. Ting H.J. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11256-11261Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and pSG5ARA267-α, pGEX-GST-ARA267αN1, pGEX-GST-ARA267-αN2, and pGEX-GST-ARA267-αC were constructed for the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay. Human cancer cell lines PC-3, U2OS, SAO2, DU145, HepG2, and H1299 were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (25 units/ml), and streptomycin (25 µg/ml). T47D, MCF-7, and LNCaP were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (25 units/ml), and streptomycin (25 µg/ml). A MATCHMAKER yeast two-hybrid human brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) that consists of the GAL4 activation domain, amino acids (aa) 768–881, fused with human brain cDNA was used in our yeast two-hybrid screening. The library was screened by co-transformation with a bait construct, GAL4-DBD fused with full-length testicular receptor 4 (TR4) protein, as previously described (5Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The transformed yeast Y190 cells were selected for growth on plates with 20 mm3-aminotriazole and 1 µm 5α-DHT but without histidine, leucine, or trytophan. TR4 is a nuclear orphan receptor with an unknown ligand. Mating tests were used to further confirm protein-protein interaction in yeast cells. One of the initial 31 potentially positive clones reacted firmly with the TR4 and AR-LBD fusion protein (GAL4-DBD-AR-LBD, aa 595–918). This clone was designated Y1600 and selected for further evaluation. Using the sequence of the clone we isolated from the library, we searched the GenBankTM data base. Using the sequence of EST clones, several primers were designed with a 5′-linker containing the restriction enzyme site in order to amplify this clone to full-length. An ∼8.0-kb product was amplified, sequenced (BigDye Terminator Kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and subcloned into the pSG5 vector. The polymerase chain reaction template was Marathon human testis cDNA library (CLONTECH) and the program consisted of 94 °C for 1 min, five cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 12 min, five cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 12 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, and 68 °C for 12 min. The 5′ start codon ATG was confirmed by 5′-RACE-PCR. Human cancer cell lines, PC-3, HepG2, U2OS, SAO2, T47D, LNCaP, DU145, H1299, and MCF-7 were cultured following the methods previously described. Total RNA was isolated from each cell line using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 25 µg of total RNA from each cell line was loaded onto denaturing agarose gels. The RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto a nylon membrane using a vacuum blotter. The Y1600 clone containing a 1.6-kb fragment of ARA267-α (base pairs 911–2542) was used as the hybridization probe, and a β-actin probe was used as a control for equivalent RNA loading. A human multiple tissue RNA dot blot, purchased fromCLONTECH (catalog number 7775-1), was also hybridized with the same ARA267-α (Y1600 clone) probe to evaluate tissue distributions of ARA267-α in normal human tissues. Human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU145, lung cancer cell line H1299, and hepatoma cell line HepG2 were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, the cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, and experiments were performed by modified calcium phosphate techniques as previously described (5Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated with steroid hormones for another 24 h and then harvested for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay. The MMTV-CAT reporter gene was used to measure AR transcriptional activity, and a β-galactosidase expression gene (pCMV-β-Gal) was incorporated into the experiments as an internal control (5Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). CAT activity was visualized by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and quantitated by IMAGEQUANT software (Molecular Dynamics). For the luciferase (LUC) assay, pG5-LUC, pMMTV-LUC, or estrogen response element-LUC plasmid was used as the reporter gene and SV40-Renillaluciferase reporter plasmid (pRL) (Promega) was used as an internal control. The dual-luciferase reporter 1000 assay system (Promega) was employed to measure the LUC activity. GST·ARA-267-α N- and C-terminal fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21 and purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified fusion proteins were resuspended in 100 µl of interaction buffer (20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and mixed with 5 µl of 35S-labeled TNT-expressed AR N-terminal, C-terminal, and full-length proteins (TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) in the presence or absence of 1 µm DHT and incubated at 4 °C for 5 h. After several washes with NETN buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8% glycerol), the bound proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the luciferase assay, 3 µg of pG5-LUC plasmid was used as the reporter gene and 10 ng of SV40-pRL was used as an internal control. We transfected 4.0 µg of ARA267 and 2.0 µg of GAL4·AR-C and VP16·AR-N into PC-3 cells, with or without 1 nm DHT, using the calcium phosphate method. The dual-luciferase reporter 1000 assay system was employed to measure LUC activity. LNCaP cells were transfected with pSG5ARA267-α and pSG5 vector by SuperFect (Qiagen), respectively. After 2 h of transfection, the medium was changed, cells were cultured for 16 h, and ethanol and 10 nm DHT were applied for another 36 h, respectively. The cells were harvested and lysed following the manufacturer's protocol (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In each sample, 50 µg of whole-cell lysis proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transferring, the membrane was blotted with polyclonal AR antibody (NH27), PSA antibody (Dako Corporation), and β-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The bands were developed with an alkaline phosphatase detection kit (Bio-Rad). To further understand the function and mechanism of nuclear receptor action, LBDs of AR and TR4, an orphan receptor, were used as bait to fish out the interacting proteins from the yeast two-hybrid system. ARA267-α, which can interact not only with TR4 but also with AR-LBD in the presence of 1 µm DHT, was isolated. RACE-PCR technology with the isolated DNA insert as template was used, and several primers were then designed to amplify the full-length human ARA267-α from the Marathon human testis cDNA library. Unexpectedly, the amplified DNA was an exceptionally long insert over 8 kb in size. The longest uninterrupted coding sequence within this 8-kb transcript had 2427 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 267 kDa (Fig.1A). Sequence analysis indicates that ARA267-α is a novel human gene, with no homology to previously identified AR coregulators, such as ARA24, ARA54, ARA55, ARA70, or ARA160. ARA267-α contains several important functional domains (Fig. 1A, boxed or underlined). For example, ARA267-α contains one SET domain (aa 1668–1795), two LXXLL motifs (aa 726–730 and aa 1283–1287), three nuclear translocation signals (NLS) (aa 243–260, aa 888–905, and aa 1202–1219), four plant homodomain (PHD) fingers (aa 1274–1320, aa 1321–1377, aa 1438–1482, and aa 1849–1896), and a proline-rich region. In the four PHD finger regions we also found a cysteine-rich region (aa 1277–1342), a Ring finger (aa 1324–1369), and a zinc finger (aa 1884–1909). A comparison of ARA267-α to the human EST cDNA sequence available from the GenBankTM data base indicates two separate cDNA sequences that matched ARA267-α. One has a sequence identical to the N terminus of ARA267-α. The other, ARA267-β, has a different N-terminal sequence forming a different 279-amino acid sequence that merges into the 11th amino acid of ARA267-α and forms an uninterrupted coding sequence of 2696 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 296 kDa (Fig. 1, B and C). The amino acid sequence analysis shows that ARA267-β has 83% homology with the mouse NSD1 (19Huang N. vom Baur E. Garnier J.M. Lerouge T. Vonesch J.L. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 15: 3398-3412Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a protein that may function as a coregulator for retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) (19Huang N. vom Baur E. Garnier J.M. Lerouge T. Vonesch J.L. Lutz Y. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1998; 15: 3398-3412Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is possible that ARA267-α and ARA267-β are products of alternative splicing sites although the detailed mechanism remains unclear. Northern blot analysis indicates that ARA267-α was expressed as two mRNA transcripts of about 13 and 10 kb in cell lines such as PC-3, U2OS, SAO2, T47D, LNCaP, DU145, H1299, and MCF7 (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-7 and 9) but is absent in the HepG2 cell line (Fig. 2A, lane 8). Multiple-tissue dot blot was used to determine the expression pattern of ARA267-α in different tissues, using prostate as an indicator. We found lung, placenta, uterus, kidney, thymus, lymph node, liver, pancreas, and thyroid gland tissues have higher expression levels than prostate tissue, with lymph node as the highest. In contrast, tissues like bladder, testis, ovary, skeletal muscle, and mammary gland have relatively lower expression levels than prostate tissue (Fig.2B). The GST pull-down assay was applied to confirm and further map the interaction domains between ARA267-α and AR that were shown in the yeast two-hybrid system. Two ARA267-α N-terminal domains, ARA267-αN1 (aa 1–382) and ARA267-αN2 (aa 1–984), and one C-terminal domain, ARA267-αC (aa 1716–2427) were constructed in a GST fusion vector (Fig.3A). Each of these E. coli-generated GST fusion proteins were then incubated in vitro with translated [35S]methionine-labeled AR-N (aa 36–553), AR-C (aa 553–918), or full-length AR (Fig.3A) for the GST pull-down assay. The results indicate that neither GST·ARA267-αN1 nor GST·ARA267-αN2 can interact with AR-N (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4) but both can interact with AR-C (Fig. 3B, lanes 8–11) and full-length AR in the presence or absence of 1 µm DHT (Fig. 3B, lanes 15–18). The results shown in Fig. 3C further demonstrate that ARA267-αC can interact with the AR-C peptide and full-length AR in a DHT-enhanced manner (Fig. 3C, lanes 7–8and 12–13). In contrast, ARA267-αC cannot interact with AR-N (Fig. 3C, lane 3). These data suggest that the AR C-terminal (DBD and LBD domain) but not the N-terminal is responsible for the interaction between AR and ARA267-α. As early data suggested that the N terminus of AR can also interact with the C terminus of AR (36He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), we were interested in whether the association of ARA267-α with the C terminus of AR can influence the interaction between the N and C terminus of AR. Using the relative LUC activity assay, we found that the coregulator CBP can enhance the interaction between the N and C terminus of AR. In contrast, ARA267-α is more like previously identified coregulators such as ARA70, ARA55, or ARA54 that show little influence on the AR N-C termini interaction (Fig. 4). Human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line, which is an AR-negative cell line, was transiently transfected with 3 µg of MMTV-CAT reporter, 1 µg of AR expression vector (pSG5AR), and with increasing amounts of full-length ARA267-α (pSG5-ARA267-α) in 60-mm culture dishes. The total plasmid amount was adjusted to 11 µg with pSG5. As shown in Fig.5A, ARA267-α can enhance DHT-mediated AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were also observed in human lung cancer H1299 cells (Fig. 5A). To further confirm ARA267-α coregulator activity and rule out the potential artifact effect from the LUC assay, we also performed Western blot analysis to see if ARA267-α can also enhance the AR endogenous target gene, PSA, expression in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 5B, ARA267-α can enhance DHT-induced PSA protein expression. In contrast, ARA267-α showed little induction on AR protein expression. For the ligand specificity assay, our data show that DHT is the best ligand for the ARA267-α coregulator activity. Unlike ARA70, which was able to enhance AR transactivation in the presence of other ligands such as E2, hydroxyflutamide, and Δ5-androstenediol, ARA267-α shows only marginal effects on AR transactivation in the presence of 10 nm E2 (Fig.6). To test the ARA267-α receptor specificity, we replaced AR with other members of the SR family, such as the GR, PR, and ER, in the LUC assay with HepG2 cells that do not express endogenous ARA267-α. As shown in Fig. 7, ARA267-α has better coregulator activity on AR as compared with PR. In contrast, ARA267-α only has a marginal effect on the transactivation of GR and ER. Similar results also occurred when we replaced HepG2 cells with PC-3 cells. Since it has been demonstrated that several AR coregulators have the capacity to enhance AR transactivation (5Yeh S.

As shown in Fig. 8, we found that ARA267-α can additionally enhance AR transactivation with other AR coregulators, such as ARA24 (8Hsiao P.W. Lin D.L. Nakao R. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20229-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or PCAF, a coregulator with histone acetylase activity (14Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.C. Ting H. Rahman M. Lin H.-K. Fugimoto N. Hu Y.-C. Huang K.E. Chang C. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in PC-3 cells. Together, our data demonstrate that ARA267-α functions as a coregulator to increase AR transcription activity in a ligand-dependent manner. ARA267-α is the first identified AR coregulator that contains the SET domain, an evolutionarily conserved sequence that has a 130-amino acid motif named from three originally identified proteins,Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, andTrithorax (20Jenuwein T.

Alder H. Prasad R. Canaani O. Cimino G. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cell. 1992; 71: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar), may also play important roles in the regulation of transcriptional activation or repression via direct modulation of the chromatin structure (22Gould A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which may result in cell growth control or disease progression (21Firestein R. Cui X. Huie P. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4900-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Cardoso C. Timsit S. Villard L. Khrestchatisky M. Fontes M. Colleaux L. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1998; 18: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The self-interaction of the SET domains may be one of the mechanisms in integrating the activity of these proteins (27Rozovskaia T. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Sedkov Y. Burakov D. Yano T. Nakamura T. Petruck S. Ben-Simchon L. Croce C.M. Mazo A. Canaani E. Oncogene. 2000; 20: 351-357Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether ARA267-α also plays important roles in AR-mediated gene activation via its SET domain is a very interesting question. One of the most distinct features of SR coregulators is the presence of the LXXLL motif, which plays an important role in interaction between coregulators and receptors for the enhancement of SR transactivation. By mutating LXXLL to LXXAA, Heery et al. (29Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar) found that SRC1 failed to function as a steroid receptor coregulator. Similar results also occurred with the TIFII coregulator (30Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6001-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As ARA267-α contains two LXXLL motifs, we expect these motifs may also play an important role in the enhancement of AR transactivation. In addition to the SET domain and LXXLL motifs, ARA267-α also contains three nuclear translocation signal (NLS) domains that have been shown to play essential roles for the translocation of proteins from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (31Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ARA267-α has four PHD fingers that may play important roles in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation. As these PHD fingers overlap with the cysteine-rich region, the zinc finger and the RING finger, we expect that ARA267-α may be able to bind to DNA via these regions. Other proteins with cysteine-rich regions, such as the members of the Trithorax or Polycomb groups, are well known for their roles in chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation (32Aasland R. Gibson T.J Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Recent reports link some PHD finger proteins to chromatin remodeling via histone acetylation (33Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other SR coregulators, such as TIF1α and CBP/p300 also contain PHD finger motifs and have been demonstrated to play important roles in SR-mediated gene transcription. Together, we speculate that based on sequence analysis, ARA267-α may play important roles in AR-mediated gene transcription via the SET domain or PHD fingers. Previous reports suggest that the interaction between the N and C terminus of AR might play some role in AR-mediated gene transcription (34Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 35Langley E. Zhou Z.X. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Some selected AR coregulators, such as CBP, have been shown to facilitate the interaction between the N and C terminus of AR. Since we were unable to show that ARA267-α has any significant influence on this interaction, we anticipate that ARA267-α functions through a different mechanism to enhance AR transactivation. In our previous reports, we have demonstrated that AR transactivation could be enhanced by 10 nm E2 in the presence of selected coregulators, such as ARA70 (13Yeh S. Miyamoto H. Shima H. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5527-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Han et al.(37Han G. Foster B.A. Mistry S. Buchanan G. Harris J.M. Tilley W.D. Greenberg N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11204-11213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), Weigel and co-workers (38Agoulnik I. Stenoien D. Mancini M. Weigel N. Keystone Steroid Symposium. Steamboat Springs, CO2000Google Scholar), and Truica et al. (17Truica C.I. Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar) also reported that E2 could enhance AR transactivation in the presence of ARA70, SRC1, or β-catenin, respectively. The results shown in Fig. 6 confirmed these studies. ARA70N can enhance AR transactivation in the presence of 10 nm E2. In contrast ARA267-α has only a marginal effect on the enhancement of AR transactivation in the presence of 10 nm E2. These data, therefore, suggest that different coregulators may have distinct mechanisms to enhance AR transactivation in the presence of various ligands. The results shown in Fig. 7 indicate that in the HepG2 and PC-3 cells, ARA267-α only has some marginal enhancement effect on the transactivation of other steroid receptors, such as PR, ER, and GR. Since the maximal function of any given steroid receptor could be related to the combination of the availability of the receptors and their relative abundance compared with many other general transcriptional factors and coregulators (which could differ in various cell lines; Ref. 14Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.C. Ting H. Rahman M. Lin H.-K. Fugimoto N. Hu Y.-C. Huang K.E. Chang C. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we might expect that in other cells, ARA267-α may have different preferential coactivations and may be able to greatly increase the enhancement of other forms of steroid receptor transactivation. In conclusion, our data show that ARA267-α acts as an AR coregulator to increase AR transactivation. ARA267-α might exert its AR coactivation through modulating chromatin structure and interacting with other transcription factors. Further investigation is warranted to reveal the detailed functions of ARA267-α on AR and its target organs. We thank Drs. Michael R. Erdos, Rik Derynck, and Richard H.

In this study we determined the effect of IGF-I on cultured mesangial cells (MCs) and examined activation of key signaling pathways. IGF-I induced hypertrophy as determined by an increase in cell size and an increase in protein to DNA ratio and increased accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. IGF-I also activated both Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in MCs. Inhibition of either MAPK or PI3K, however, had no effect on IGF-I-induced hypertrophy or ECM production. Next, we examined the effect of IGF-I on activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. IGF-I treatment stimulated calcineurin activity and increased the protein levels of calcineurin and the calcineurin binding protein, calmodulin. Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, blocked both IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy and up-regulation of ECM. In addition, calcineurin resulted in sustained Akt activation, indicating possible cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Finally, IGF-I treatment resulted in the calcineurindependent nuclear localization of NFATc1. Therefore, IGF-I induces hypertrophy and increases ECM accumulation in MCs. IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy is associated with activation of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and PI3K but does not require either of these pathways.

Glomeruli, the filtering microvascular structures, are particularly susceptible to hypertrophy, which eventuates in fibrosis. At the cellular level, hypertrophy is characterized by cessation of the cell cycle at G1, a halt in DNA synthesis, and continued production and/or decreased degradation of cellular proteins (1Wolf G. Ziyadeh F.N. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 393-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The net result is an increase in protein concentration disproportionate to DNA and an increase in the overall size of the cell. In addition to the increase in cell size, expansion of the extracellular matrix (ECM),1 including fibronectin and collagen type IV, contributes to tissue hypertrophy. Studies in humans and in animal models of renal hypertrophy indicate that early hypertrophy and ECM accumulation are potentially reversible (2Gronbaek H. Volmers P. Bjorn S. Osterby R. Orskov H. Flyvbjerg A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E918-E924PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that are required for the induction and maintenance of hypertrophy and ECM accumulation by growth factors, hormones, and cytokines may be critical for developing therapies that prevent or reverse renal hypertrophy. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in glomerular hypertrophy. In patients with type I diabetes, elevated amounts of IGF-I in the urine are associated with hypertrophy and progression of kidney disease (3Verotti A. Cieri F. Petitti M. Morgese G. Chiarelli F. Diabetes Nutr. Metab. 1999; 12: 271-276PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, endogenous kidney IGF-I levels are elevated within 2–3 days of streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes in rats (4Flyvbjerg A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: S12-S19Google Scholar, 5Feld S. Hirschberg R. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 423-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and IGF-I receptor is up-regulated after prolonged hyperglycemia (6Sugimoto H. Shikata K. Makino H. Ota K. Ota Z. Nephron. 1996; 72: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although overexpression of growth hormone (which regulates IGF-I) causes both hypertrophy and sclerosis of mouse kidneys (7Doi T. Striker L.J. Quaife C. Conti F.G. Palmiter R. Behringer R. Brinster R. Striker G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 131: 398-403PubMed Google Scholar), increased circulating levels of IGF-I result primarily in hypertrophy (8Quaife C.J. Mathews L.S. Pinkert C.A. Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This suggests that endogenous rather than circulating levels of IGF-I mediate hypertrophy and subsequent sclerosis. Alternatively, IGF-I is necessary for hypertrophy but may be insufficient for development of sclerosis. Flyvbjerg et al. (9Flyvbjerg A. Marshall S.M. Frystyk J. Hansen K.W. Harris A.G. Orskov H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that treatment of diabetic rats with octreotide, a somatostatin inhibitor, decreased circulating IGF-I and IGF-II levels. Moreover, kidney hypertrophy was decreased and urinary albumin excretion was blocked (9Flyvbjerg A. Marshall S.M. Frystyk J. Hansen K.W. Harris A.G. Orskov H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Several other studies support this finding (2Gronbaek H. Volmers P. Bjorn S. Osterby R. Orskov H. Flyvbjerg A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E918-E924PubMed Google Scholar, 10Flyvbjerg A. Bennet W.F. Rasch R. Kopchick J.J. Scarlett J.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Although IGF-I is undoubtedly an important growth factor that mediates vascular renal pathology, very little is known about the signaling pathways activated by IGF-I in renal cells. In some cells, IGF-I commonly signals through two main pathways, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Erk1/Erk2 MAPK pathways (11Yenush L. White M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Both are activated following association of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins with the IGF-I receptor and coupling of the activated tyrosine kinase receptor to downstream signaling targets. However, there is very little evidence regarding what pathway(s) IGF-I activates in specific renal cells, including those derived from the glomerulus. di Mari et al. (12di Mari J. Davis R. Safirstein R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 2777: F195-F203Google Scholar) showed that IGF-I treatment results in activation of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK in proximal tubule cells. In addition, Horney et al. (13Horney M.J. Shirley D.W. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1045-F1053PubMed Google Scholar) showed phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins IRS1 and IRS2 by IGF-I in cultured mesangial cells. Mesangial cells constitute one third of glomerular cell populations and contribute to hypertrophy of glomeruli seen in diabetes or other conditions characterized by renal hypertrophy (2Gronbaek H. Volmers P. Bjorn S. Osterby R. Orskov H. Flyvbjerg A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E918-E924PubMed Google Scholar, 4Flyvbjerg A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: S12-S19Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effect of IGF-I on cultured MCs from glomeruli of rats and evaluated both proliferative and hypertrophic effects. We also examined the signaling pathways activated by IGF-I, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways. In addition, we investigated IGF-I-mediated activation of other pathways, including the calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin. Accordingly, we determined what effect inhibition of these pathways has on IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy and ECM production. Finally, we demonstrated the significance of calcineurin activation by showing IGF-I-mediated nuclear translocation of the calcineurin substrate, nuclear factor of activated T cells- c1 (NFATc1). Receptor grade recombinant human IGF-I was purchased from GroPep (Adelaide, Australia), and recombinant human TGFβ1 was obtained from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). PD98059 was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Wortmannin, cyclosporin A, calcium ionophore A23187, and anti-fibronectin antibody were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Anti-collagen type IV antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), anti-phospho Akt, anti-phospho-Erk1/Erk2, and anti-calcineurin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and anti-NFATc1 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat MCs were cultured from glomeruli isolated by differential sieving as previously described (14Shultz P. DeCorleto P. Silver B. Abboud H. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F674-F684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were removed by digestion with collagenase, and glomerular cores were cultured in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with antibiotics and 17% fetal calf serum. For these experiments, rat MCs that have been maintained in our laboratory (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX) were used between passage 26 and 32. MCs were plated in 60-mm plates and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluency. Medium was then changed to serum-free media (SFM) for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. After treatment, MCs were harvested by trypsinization, washed with 1× PBS, centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min, and then resuspended in ice-cold 70% ethanol added dropwise while vortexing. Ethanol-fixed MCs were then analyzed by forward light scattering on a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer. MCs were plated in triplicate in 12-well plates and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluence. Medium was changed to SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. Each well was washed, collected by trypsinization, and split into two equal aliquots. Both samples were washed with 1× PBS and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 2 min. One aliquot was resuspended in TNESV protein lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10−7m phenylmethylsulfonyl (PMSF)) and the other in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For determination of DNA concentration, Hoescht stain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to ethanol fixed cells for 30 min at room temperature. DNA was measured at 355-nm excitation and 460-nm emission using a Titertak Flouroskan II fluorometer. For each well the resulting protein determination was divided by the DNA measurement to provide a protein/DNA ratio. MCs were plated in 60-mm plates and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluency (∼2 days). Medium was then changed to SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. Erk1/Erk2 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of total protein using anti-Erk1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by protein A-Sepharose beads. Immunocomplexes were washed three times in TNESV buffer and resuspended in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm Na3VO4) in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP), 25 μM cold ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C followed by 10-min incubation on ice. Phosphorylated MBP was resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and an exposure was made onto film. Kinase activity was determined as described previously (16Choudhury G.G. Karamitsos C. Hernandez J. Gentilini A. Bardgette J. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F931-F938PubMed Google Scholar). 2J. M. Ricono, M. Arar, G. Gosh Choudhury, and H. E. Abboud (2001) Am. J. Physiol., in press. Briefly, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of total protein samples by incubation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for 30 min on ice followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads and additional incubation on ice for 2 h. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with lysis buffer, once with PBS, once with buffer A (0.5 mm LiCl, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH. 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4), once with double-distilled water, and once with buffer B (0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The immunocomplexes were then resuspended in 50 μl of PI3K buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA). 0.5 μl of 20 mg/ml PI was added and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. A mixture of 1 μl of 1 mMgCl2 and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 150 μl of a mixture of chloroform, methanol, and 11.6 n HCl (50:100:1, v/v) was added to stop the reaction, and an additional 100 μl of chloroform was added. The organic layer was extracted and washed with methanol and 1 n HCl (1:1). The reaction was dried overnight and resuspended in 10 μl of chloroform. The samples were separated by thin-layer chromatography and developed with CHCl3/MeOH/28% NH4OH/H2O (129:114:15:21). The spots were visualized by autoradiography. MCs were plated in 60-mm dishes and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluency (∼2 days). Medium was then changed to SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. Cells were then harvested with trypsin-EDTA, pelleted, and washed with 1× PBS. Protein was extracted using TNESV lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10−7mphenylmethylsulfonyl (PMSF)). 25 μg of protein was analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer of the proteins to nitrocellulose, the membrane was incubated in 5% milk-TBST and then immunoblotted with 1:2000 dilution of anti-fibronectin or 1:1000 dilution of anti-collagen type IV antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey-anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey-anti-goat secondary antibody was added at 1:2000 for fibronectin and collagen type IV, respectively, and proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). MCs were plated in 8-well chamber slides and allowed to grow to 80–90% confluency (∼2 days). Medium was then changed to SFM for 24 h, and the cells were treated as indicated. Following treatment, the cells were fixed and permeabilized in 100% methanol for 5 min and then rehydrated in PBS-0.1% BSA for 15 min. Cells were then blocked with the appropriate IgG for 15 min, and then primary antibodies were added for 30 min. Anti-fibronectin, anti-collagen type IV, and anti-NFATc1 were all added at a concentration of 15 μg. Cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS-0.1% BSA before addition of secondary antibodies as indicated. All secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1–100. Finally, cells were washed three times for 5 min with PBS-0.1% BSA, the chambers were removed from the slides, and the coverslips were mounted with Crystal Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Cells were viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Calcineurin phosphatase activity was determined following a protocol published by Fruman et al. (17Fruman D.A. Pai S.-Y. Klee C.N. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, the RII peptide was phosphorylated in vitro with 250 units of recombinant PKA, 50 mm ATP, 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.15 mm RII, and 500 μl of 2× reaction buffer (40 mm MOPS, 4 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 0.8 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA). Lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in a hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) followed by 3 cycles of freeze thawing in liquid nitrogen and a 30 °C water bath. Calcineurin activity in each sample was determined by incubating equal parts lysate, 3× reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1m NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 500 nm okadaic acid, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA), and labeled RII peptide at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1 m KPO4 in 5% trichloroacetic acid. To determine the amount of phosphate released by calcineurin in each sample, reactions were then added to PolyPrep columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) containing AG-50X Dowex ion exchange resin (Bio-Rad) prepared as described in a previous study (17Fruman D.A. Pai S.-Y. Klee C.N. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Finally, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was added to the flow-through from each column, and the released phosphate was measured in a scintillation counter. To ensure specificity of the assay for calcineurin activity, okadaic acid was routinely added to the reaction buffer to inhibit any dephosphorylation by serine-threonine phosphatases PP1A and PP2A. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test. A result was considered significant if p < 0.05. In vivo studies demonstrated that IGF-I plays a role in renal hypertrophy (4Flyvbjerg A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: S12-S19Google Scholar, 9Flyvbjerg A. Marshall S.M. Frystyk J. Hansen K.W. Harris A.G. Orskov H. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 805-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 18Abboud H.E. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: S3-S6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether IGF-I acts as a proliferative agent for renal cells as it does with many other cells or if IGF-I can directly initiate hypertrophy. Therefore, in this study we examined the effect of IGF-I on cultured mesangial cells (MCs). Hypertrophy was determined as an increase in cell size (without an increase in cell number) and an increase in protein production without an increase in DNA synthesis. Fig. 1 A shows that IGF-I treatment (50 ng/ml) of MCs resulted in an increase in cell size as determined by FACS analysis. The effect of IGF-I was comparable to the effect of TGFβ (1 ng/ml), which is known to induce hypertrophy in these cells (19Choi M. Eung-Gook K. Ballerman B. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 948-958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Treatment of MCs with both IGF-I and TGFβ resulted in an additive hypertrophic effect. FACS analysis of these cells showed that there was no difference in the distribution of cells in the cell cycle after IGF-I or TGFβ treatments compared with SFM control (data not shown). IGF-I induced hypertrophy in a dose-dependent manner, with 50 ng/ml resulting in a significant increase in both cell size and protein/DNA ratio (Fig. 1 B). The maximal effect of IGF-I was equal to or slightly greater than was seen with TGFβ treatment of these cells. Hypertrophy was discernible as early as 8 h after treatment and was detectable for as long as 72 h after exposure of cells to IGF-I (data not shown). Finally, there was a small increase in DNA synthesis following IGF-I treatment but only at concentrations of 100 ng/ml or greater (Fig. 1 C). There are conflicting reports regarding the ability of IGF-I to induce ECM production in renal cells. Previous in vivo experiments have shown that overexpression of IGF-I contributes to hypertrophy but is not sufficient for ECM production and development of fibrosis (7Doi T. Striker L.J. Quaife C. Conti F.G. Palmiter R. Behringer R. Brinster R. Striker G.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1988; 131: 398-403PubMed Google Scholar). However, other in vitro studies have shown that IGF-I does contribute to an increase in ECM (20Schreiber B. Hughes M. Groggel G. Clin. Nephrol. 1995; 43: 368-374PubMed Google Scholar, 21Pricci F. Pugliese G. Romano G. Romeo G. Locuratolo N. Pugliese F. Mene P. Galli G. Casini A. Rotella C. Di Mario U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In our experiments, MCs were treated with IGF-I or TGFβ for 72 h, and the levels of collagen type IV and fibronectin were determined by both Western blotting (Fig. 2 A) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2 B). We found that IGF-I induces an increase in both collagen type IV and fibronectin protein levels although not as robustly as does TGFβ. Interestingly, the amount of IGF-I that was sufficient to stimulate an increase in ECM (at least 100 ng/ml) was double that which was required to induce maximal hypertrophy (50 ng/ml). Similar to hypertrophy, IGF-I and TGFβ together resulted in an additive effect on the levels of ECM proteins. We next examined the signaling pathways activated by IGF-I in MCs. Using an in vitro kinase assay with myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate for Erk1/Erk2 MAPK, we show that IGF-I treatment results in activation of MAPK in MCs (Fig. 3 A). This activation was blocked by pretreatment with PD98059, an inhibitor of the Erk1/Erk2 kinase MEK. In addition, we treated MCs with IGF-I for increasing lengths of time and examined phosphorylation of Erk1/Erk2 using a phospho-specific Erk1/Erk2 antibody. Erk1/Erk2 was transiently phosphorylated following addition of IGF-I with maximal activation at 10 min (or less) that was reduced, even to below basal conditions, by 4 h. Pretreatment with PD98059 also blocked phosphorylation of Erk1/Erk2. Total Erk1/Erk2 protein level was determined by direct immunoblotting, and no change in the amount of Erk1/Erk2 protein was found (Fig. 3 B). Next we examined activation of the PI3K pathway following IGF-I treatment in MCs. Fig. 3 C shows that IGF-I activated PI3K and resulted in increased production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. This activation was completely blocked by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K activity. We also treated MCs with IGF-I for increasing lengths of time and examined phosphorylation of Akt, a serine/threonine kinase regulated downstream of PI3K (Fig. 3 D). Similar to Erk1/Erk2 phosphorylation, Akt phosphorylation was maximal at 10 min and decreased thereafter. Interestingly, although Akt phosphorylation peaked early, persistent activation was seen at 4 h. In addition, pretreatment with wortmannin blocked only IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at 10 min. At 4 h, IGF-I-mediated phosphorylation of Akt was unaffected by wortmannin pretreatment. This suggests a PI3K-independent mechanism of sustained Akt phosphorylation. There were no changes in the levels of Akt protein. Our experiments thus far indicate that IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy in MCs is associated with activation of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and PI3K. Therefore, we next determined whether IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy was dependent on activation of either of these pathways. MCs were pretreated with inhibitors of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK (10 μmPD98059), PI3K (250 nm wortmannin), or vehicle alone (Me2SO), and then IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy was assessed by FACS analysis. Fig. 4 Ashows that inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK or PI3K had no effect on IGF-I-induced increase in cell size. Similar results were obtained when protein/DNA ratio was measured. Also, similar results were obtained when PI3K was inhibited with the compound LY294002 (data not shown). We also determined the role of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and PI3K signaling on IGF-I-mediated increase in ECM proteins collagen type IV and fibronectin. Fig. 4 B shows that inhibition of either pathway failed to block the increase in ECM proteins by IGF-I. Several studies have identified the calcium-regulated serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin as a potential mediator of hypertrophy (22Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olsen E.N. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar,23Molkentin J. Lu J. Antos C. Markham B. Richardson J. Robbins J. Grant S. Olsen E. Cell. 1998; 93: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the role of calcineurin in IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy of MCs. Calcineurin phosphatase activity was determined in response to IGF-I using a highly specific in vitrophosphatase assay (17Fruman D.A. Pai S.-Y. Klee C.N. Burakoff S.J. Bierer B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 146-154Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The addition of IGF-I to the cells resulted in approximately a 50% increase in calcineurin activity (Fig. 5 A). Calcineurin is inhibited by the immunosuppressive compound cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A enters cells and binds to a group of proteins known as cyclophilins. Cyclosporin A-cyclophilin complexes, in turn, bind to the β subunit of calcineurin, resulting in inhibition of phosphatase activity (24Schreiber S. Crabtree G. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar,25Tumlin J.A. Am. J. Kidney Dis. 1997; 30: 884-895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Due to the specificity of action of cyclosporin A in inhibiting calcineurin, we used this compound to block IGF-I-mediated activation of calcineurin. Calcineurin phosphatase activity was determined in cells pretreated with cyclosporin A (5 μm), PD98059 (10 μm), or wortmannin (250 nm) and then stimulated with IGF-I for 2 h. As expected, pretreatment with cyclosporin A completely blocked calcineurin phosphatase activity, whereas inhibition of either Erk1/Erk2 MAPK or PI3K had no effect (Fig. 5 A). We next examined the time course of calcineurin phosphatase activation by IGF-I. Fig. 5 B shows that addition of IGF-I resulted in significant activation of calcineurin phosphatase within minutes of treatment that returned to basal levels after 4–6 h. Interestingly, phosphatase activity peaked roughly 2 h after IGF-I treatment, in contrast to the very early maximal phosphorylation of both Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and Akt. Increased calcineurin phosphatase activity has been shown to precede up-regulation of calcineurin protein (26Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Steinberg L. Taigen T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D. Circulation. 1999; : 2431-2437PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, there was a substantial increase in calcineurin protein within 24 h of IGF-I treatment (Fig. 5 C). Calcineurin activity is dependent upon binding both calcium and calmodulin. Therefore, we examined the effect of IGF-I on calmodulin protein levels. There was also a substantial increase in the calcineurin binding protein calmodulin in a time frame similar to the increase in calcineurin protein (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, protein levels of Erk1/Erk2 MAPK did not change over the course of the experiment, indicating a selective increase in calcineurin/calmodulin proteins rather than a global increase in total proteins. To determine if activation of calcineurin is required for IGF-I-induced hypertrophy, MCs were treated with cyclosporin A to inhibit calcineurin activity prior to addition of IGF-I. Both IGF-I-mediated increase in cell size and increase in protein/DNA ratio were blocked following inhibition of calcineurin. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with calcium ionophore A23187 to increase intracellular calcium significantly increased IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy (Fig. 6 A). Next we determined if calcineurin was required for IGF-I-mediated induction of ECM. Fig. 6 B shows that pretreatment with cyclosporin A blocked IGF-I-mediated increase in both collagen type IV and fibronectin protein levels. Cyclosporin A alone had no effect on either total protein synthesis (reflected by protein/DNA ratio) or on basal levels of collagen type IV or fibronectin. Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin only abolished Akt phosphorylation at 10 min and had no effect on IGF-I-mediated Akt phosphorylation at 4 h (Fig. 3 D). The lack of inhibition of the delayed Akt activation by wortmannin suggests a PI3K-independent mechanism of sustained Akt activation. Therefore, in Fig. 7 A, we examined the role of calcineurin in sustained Akt activation. MC were pretreated with SFM (control), wortmannin (250 nm), or cyclosporin A (5 μm) and then treated with IGF-I for 10 min or 4 h. Phosphorylated Akt was detected by Western blotting with a phospho-specific Akt antibody. At 10 min, wortmannin greatly reduced IGF-I-mediated Akt phosphorylation, as shown before, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect. After 4 h of IGF-I treatment, Akt phosphorylation is still detectable in control cells, and wortmannin pretreatment does not reduce this phosphorylation. However, pretreatment with cyclosporin A blocks IGF-I-mediated activation of Akt at 4 h. As a control, phospho-Erk1/Erk2 was also detected in cells pretreated with either wortmannin or cyclosporin A. Fig. 7 B shows that inhibition of PI3K and calcineurin had no effect on Erk1/Erk2 phosphorylation. In addition, total Erk1/Erk2 protein levels did not change over the same time period. One family of transcription factors that has been well characterized as downstream targets and mediators of calcineurin signaling is the Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cell (NFAT) family. These transcription factors are inactive in the cytosol and shuttle to the nucleus following dephosphorylation by calcineurin. NFATs associate with other transcription co-factors, including members of the Jun and Fos families and mediate transcription of target genes (27Chen L. Glover J. Hogan P. Roa A. Harrison S. Nature. 1998; 392: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 28Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). NFATc1–4 have all been shown to be regulated by calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation. In addition, nuclear localization of NFATc1 has been shown to be associated with hypertrophy (22Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olsen E.N. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 34Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olsen E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In Fig. 8 we show that 30 min of IGF-I treatment results in accumulation of NFATc1 in the nucleus. This nuclear localization of NFATc1 is dependent on calcineurin activation, because pretreatment with cyclosporin A blocks this effect entirely. In this study, we provide the first evidence that IGF-I plays a direct role in the initiation of hypertrophy of mesangial cells. In addition, we show that IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy is associated with increased expression of the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin and collagen type IV. Simultaneous exposure of the cells to IGF-I and TGFβ resulted in an additive effect on both hypertrophy and the increase of ECM accumulation, suggesting that these growth factors may act through parallel pathways. IGF-I is a well-characterized mitogen, and it has been speculated that the role of IGF-I in renal hypertrophy is due to its effect on cell proliferation. However, in our experiments, no change in the cell cycle was seen and no significant change in DNA synthesis was observed at the same dose of IGF-I required to induce maximal hypertrophy. At higher doses of IGF-I, there was an increase in DNA synthesis, consistent with other reports in the literature (29Grellier P. Sabbah M. Fouqueray B. Woodruff K. Yee D. Abboud H.E. Abboud S.L. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 1071-1078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Fled S.A. Hirschberg R. Artishevsky A. Nast C. Adler S.G. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). IGF-I has been shown to signal via Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and PI3K in many different cell types (11Yenush L. White M. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of each signaling pathway in mediating the biological effects of IGF-I remains to be characterized. Although Erk1/Erk2 MAPK was activated by IGF-I in our studies, it does not appear to be required for induction of hypertrophy. It is still possible that the MAPK pathway might be important for other cellular responses to IGF-I, including migration, modulation of DNA synthesis, and cell survival. Treatment of MCs with IGF-I also resulted in the activation of PI3K and Akt kinase. Interestingly, the serine/threonine kinase Akt is activated by IGF-I in a bi-phasic manner. IGF-I induced rapid activation of Akt (10 min) that was inhibited by wortmannin, demonstrating that this activation is mediated by PI3K. However, wortmannin had no effect on the delayed phase of Akt activation, indicating a PI3K-independent mechanism of activation. Inhibition of PI3K by wortmannin or LY294002 had no effect on IGF-I-induced hypertrophy, demonstrating that PI3K is not required for this biological effect of IGF-I. However, the sustained activation of Akt was inhibited by cyclosporin A, indicating that activation of calcineurin by IGF-I is responsible for the sustained Akt activation in MCs. Our data support other reports in the literature that calcineurin activation can act in concert with other signaling pathways (31Molkentin J. Circ. Res. 2000; : 731-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 32Murat A. Pellieux C. Brunner H.-R. Pedrazzini T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40867-40873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The consequences of sustained Akt activation by calcineurin and the role of Akt in IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy remain to be evaluated. Our data show that IGF-I treatment of MCs not only increases the levels of calcineurin protein, but also calmodulin. As calcineurin activation is dependent upon availability of calmodulin (33Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-23Crossref Scopus (4440) Google Scholar), one possible consequence of increased calmodulin is sustained activation of other calcium/calmodulin pathways and/or priming of the calcineurin/calmodulin system for activation by other signals. Interestingly, the increase in both calcineurin and calmodulin occurs rapidly following IGF-I treatment, particularly in comparison to the global increase in protein reflected in the protein/DNA ratio. This suggests that the IGF-I-mediated increase in calcineurin and calmodulin protein expression is a specific action of IGF-I and not merely a consequence of the generalized increase in protein synthesis associated with hypertrophy. However, a more dynamic assay of protein synthesis such as incorporation of [35S]methionine into proteins would more accurately address the contribution of global protein synthesis to the increased expression of calcineurin and calmodulin. Moreover, our data do not address the contribution of protein degradation to the modulation of calcineurin/calmodulin levels. Interestingly, calcineurin activation occurred fairly late after IGF-I treatment. Both Erk1/Erk2 MAPK and Akt are phosphorylated within minutes of IGF-I addition and peak activation has subsided in less than 1 h. Calcineurin activity appears to peak ∼2 h following addition of IGF-I and returns to baseline by 4–6 h. Additionally, calcineurin activation precedes a significant increase in calcineurin and calmodulin protein levels, as well as induction of hypertrophy by IGF-I. Our data show that this increase in phosphatase activity is in fact required for IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy. Inhibition of calcineurin with cyclosporin A completely blocks IGF-I-mediated activation of calcineurin phosphatase activity and IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy and ECM accumulation. These effects of cyclosporin A on matrix protein accumulation were specific, because the compound had no effect on total protein synthesis or on the levels of other proteins such as Erk1/Erk2. Of interest is the finding in Fig. 6 A that increased intracellular calcium due to treatment with ionophore A23187did not induce hypertrophy. This is consistent with the observation, reported by Musaro et al. (34Musaro A. McCullagh K.J. Naya F.J. Olsen E.N. Rosenthal N. Nature. 1999; 400: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), that calcium alone is actually toxic to some cells. Instead, there appears to be a requirement for an additional IGF-I-mediated signal to generate a hypertrophic response. One possibility is cross-talk with other signaling pathways such as Akt (35Yoshimoto T. Uchino H. He Q.P. Li P.A. Siesjo B.K. Brain Res. 2001; 899: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36De Windt J. Lim H. Taigen T. Wencker D. Condorelli G. Dorn G.N. Kitsis R. Molkentin J. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Several proteins have been identified as targets of calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation, including NFAT, MEF2A and -2D, and GATA (15Blaser F. Ho N. Prywes R. Chatila T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 33Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 11-23Crossref Scopus (4440) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that calcineurin is important in IGF-I-mediated hypertrophy. Therefore, calcineurin substrates may also be critical signaling molecules that mediate hypertrophy in MCs. IGF-I induces nuclear localization of NFATc1, which is dependent upon calcineurin activity. Therefore, NFATc1 may be important in transcriptional regulation of hypertrophic response genes, including ECM genes and possibly even of calcineurin and calmodulin. It remains to be seen whether other calcineurin substrates also play a role in the regulation of genes responsible for cell hypertrophy. The demonstration that IGF-I activates a calcium-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase in mesangial cells introduces a new paradigm in IGF signaling. In addition to its role as a mitogen, requiring primarily the MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways, our work and the work of other groups in this area show that IGF-I elicits relevant biological responses via calcium-dependent signaling pathways, including, but possibly not limited to, calcineurin phosphatase. Similarly, this study demonstrates another potential target tissue for the action of calcineurin. Discovering how growth factors such as IGF-I activate calcineurin and what factors downstream of calcineurin are required for inducing hypertrophy will be important areas for further research. Furthermore, calcineurin represents an intriguing new pathway with substantial relevance in renal disease. Treatment of animal models of cardiac hypertrophy with inhibitors of calcineurin have been successful at preventing hypertrophy (22Sussman M.A. Lim H.W. Gude N. Taigen T. Olsen E.N. Wieczorek D.F. Molkentin J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1690-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 26Lim H.W. De Windt L.J. Steinberg L. Taigen T. Witt S.A. Kimball T.R. Molkentin J.D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 40867-40873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); therefore, it is possible that calcineurin inhibitors may also be of therapeutic value in renal diseases characterized by hypertrophy.

Proteins containing multiple PDZ domains often bind to different trans-membrane and intracellular proteins, playing a central role as organizers of multimeric complexes. To characterize the rules underlying the binding specificity of different PDZ domains, we have assembled a novel repertoire of random peptides that are displayed at high density at the carboxyl terminus of the capsid D protein of bacteriophage λ. We have exploited this combinatorial library to determine the peptide binding preference of the seven PDZ domains of human INADL, a multi-PDZ protein that is homologous to the INAD protein of Drosophila melanogaster. This approach has permitted the determination of the consensus ligand for each PDZ domain and the assignment to class I, class II, and to a new specificity class, class IV, characterized by the presence of an acidic residue at the carboxyl-terminal position. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the involvement of specific residues at contact positions in determining the domain binding preference. However, these experiments failed to reveal simple rules that would permit the association of the chemical characteristics of any given residue in the peptide binding pocket to the preference for specific amino acid sequences in the ligand peptide. Rather, they suggested that to infer the binding preference of any PDZ domain, it is necessary to simultaneously take into account all contact positions by using computational procedures.

Typically these modules mediate protein-protein interactions through recognition of short peptides in the target protein (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1891) Google Scholar). Several approaches, based upon the screening of repertoires of combinatorial peptides, have been developed to investigate the recognition specificity of these domain families. Phage display of small peptides of random sequence has been successfully used for the characterization of binding domains such as SH2, SH3, WW, EH, etc. (reviewed in Ref. 2Kay B.K. Kasanov J. Knight S. Kurakin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PDZ domains (identified as conserved elements in postsynaptic density protein PSD-95, Disc-large tumor suppressor Dlg, Zonula occludens protein ZO-1) differ from the remaining domains since they bind to specific carboxyl-terminal sequences of target proteins and/or dimerize with other PDZ domains (reviewed in Ref. 3Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This peculiarity has limited the possibility of using “classical” peptide repertoires displayed by fusion to M13 coat proteins, since these display systems present random peptides by fusing them to the amino terminus of pIII or pVIII coat proteins. As a consequence, PDZ specificity has been studied using repertoires of chemically synthesized random peptides (4Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 5Schultz J. Hoffmuller U. Krause G. Ashurst J. Macias M.J. Schmieder P. Schneider-Mergener J.

Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Cyclic peptides may also be forced into conformations that mimic carboxyl termini (7 ). More recently Fuh et al.(8Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) show that the M13 pVIII protein can tolerate peptide extensions at its carboxyl terminus and have assembled and exploited a repertoire of random carboxyl-terminal peptides to study the binding specificity of two PDZ domains of the protein MAGI (membrane-associated guanylate kinase with inverted orientation). This approach yielded a family of specific ligands for PDZ-2, whereas only one ligand for the other domain (PDZ-3) could be identified. This result is probably a consequence of the low copy number of the displayed recombinant peptides, because even when the display vector was modified to increase the display density by 10-fold, the majority of the phage coat was made up of wild type pVIII molecules supplied by the helper phage (8Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Wilson D. Findlay R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 313-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because of the topology of the assembled pVIII coat protein, whose carboxyl terminus is buried into the capsid in contact with the genomic single-stranded DNA (10Banner D.W. Nave C. Marvin D.A. Nature. 1981; 289: 814-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is possible that only a fraction of peptides of random sequence can be tolerated in this display system without causing steric hindrance. To overcome these limitations we have designed a new type of combinatorial library, where random peptides are displayed on the surface of λ phage by fusion to the carboxyl terminus of the D-capsid protein. In this system about 95% of the D proteins are recombinant, and because the carboxyl terminus of this protein does not appear to be involved in head formation (11Yang F. Forrer P. Dauter Z. Conway J.F. Cheng N. Cerritelli M.E. Steven A.C. Pluckthun A. Wlodawer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), subunits containing short peptide extensions are expected to be assembled at the same high density irrespective of their sequence. To investigate the binding specificity of different PDZ domains, we have panned such a carboxyl-terminal library with each of the PDZ modules of hINADL,1 a protein homologous to dINAD of Drosophila melanogasterbelonging to the family of multi-PDZ proteins (12Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). dINAD is the prototypical member of this family characterized by the exclusive presence of multiple copies of PDZ domains without any catalytic or other known binding domain (13Ullmer C. Schmuck K. Figge A. Lubbert H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The five PDZ domains of dINAD participate in distinct structural and signaling functions by binding to different protein partners to assemble a macromolecular transduction complex that enables high speed signaling in Drosophilaphotoreceptors (3Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The hINADL gene was isolated because of its sequence homology to dINAD and was found to be expressed in different spliced forms in various organs and tissues (12Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Differently from dINAD, hINADL encodes a protein that contains seven PDZ domains. Although no natural partner has been characterized to date, the identification of PDZ domains repeated in tandem suggests that hINADL also functions as a molecular scaffold for organizing protein complexes. In this manuscript we analyze the binding specificity of each of the seven PDZ domains of hINADL, and we implement a computational procedure to infer the binding probability of different peptide-domain complexes. Bacterial strains used were Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), hsdS gal (λcI ts857 ind1 Sam7 nin5 lacUV5-T7 gene 1) and BB4, supF58 supE44 hsdR514 galK2 galT22 trpR55 metB1 tonA ΔlacU169 F′ [proAB + lacI q lacZΔM15 Tn 10 (tet r)]. Bovine serum albumin and Tween 20 were from Sigma. pGEX-2TK, glutathione-Sepharose, and anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) antibody were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SpeI and NotI restriction enzymes and T4 ligase were from Biolabs. Dynabeads were from DYNAL; Gigapack® III Gold packaging extract was from Stratagene. The λ display vector, λDsplay1, is described in detail in Castagnoli et al. (14Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Combinatorial Chem. and High Throughput Screening. 2001; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It contains an additional D gene under the control of pTRC promoter followed by SpeI and NotI unique cloning sites. To assemble the carboxyl-terminal peptide library, the oligonucleotide R384 (5′-GTCGAATTCTTAGCGGCCGCATTA-3′) was used as a primer for oligonucleotide R383 (5′-TCATGCCATGGAGACTAGT(NNK)9 TAATGCGGCCGCTAAGAATTCGAC-3′) (where K = G or T) containing nine degenerate codons followed by the stop codon TAA (in bold). The restriction sites SpeI and NotI are underlined. The two oligonucleotides were biotinylated at their 5′ end and annealed by mixing 200 pmols of each in 200 μl, heating at 65 °C for 5′, and slowly cooling to room temperature. The annealed DNA was made double-stranded by incubating for 2 h at 37 °C after the addition of dNTPs (500 μm) and 50 units of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. After digestion with SpeI and NotI, the biotinylated terminal fragments were removed using streptavidin-Dynabeads. The SpeI/NotI DNA fragments were passed through a Sephadex G-50 column, ligated into SpeI/NotI-digested λ vector, and incorporated into phage particles by in vitro packaging. Bacteriophages were propagated in BB4 cells on L agar plates. cDNA sequences coding for the seven INADL PDZ domains (accession number AJ224747) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid hINADL, kindly provided by S. Philipp and V. Flockerzi (12Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to the DNA regions flanking the PDZ domains coding sequences. The borders of the domains are indicated in Fig. 1. The amplified fragments were inserted in-frame into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) and purified according to manufacturer's instructions. Affinity selection of the peptide displaying λ phages was performed as described in Zucconi et al. (15Zucconi A. Dente L. Santonico E. Castagnoli L. Cesareni G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (30 μl of slurry) were coated with ∼10 μg of GST fusion proteins and pre-incubated in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin for 4 h at 4 °C. The library was then added (about 2 × 109 plaque-forming units), and the incubation was performed for 1 h at 4 °C in SM buffer (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5). The Sepharose beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed 10 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, Tween 0.05%. The adsorbed (A) and non-adsorbed (N) phages were titered by counting plaques on a BB4 bacterial lawn. The adsorbed phages were propagated by plate lysate, eluted, concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation, and subjected to the next panning cycle. After three selection cycles, phage clones were purified and tested by solid phase immunoassay against their bait proteins. Microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-GST antibody (10 μg/ml), and after washing, PDZ-GST fusion proteins (or control GST) were added at a concentration of 20 μg/ml phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, about 107 phage particles of each selected clone were added to the appropriate well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The bound phage particles were revealed using a purified IgG fraction of anti-λ serum (rabbit) diluted 1:500 from a170 μg/ml stock (16Santi E. Capone S. Mennuni C. Lahm A. Tramontano A. Luzzago A. Nicosia A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and a secondary, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, anti-rabbit goat antibody (Sigma A-8025). The chromogenic reaction was developed for 1 h at 37 °C by adding p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma 1047), and the reading was performed at 405–620-nm dual wavelength. The DNA inserts of selected phage clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen), and sequenced using an ABI Prism™ 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the unique site mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that utilizes a two-primer system to generate site-specific mutations in double-stranded plasmids. PGEX-PDZ7 was used as a template. The mutagenic oligonucleotides were R722, 5′-CCTTCTTCATAGACTGAACGGATAACTATAGCATTC-3′ (for PDZ7RS), and R723, 5′-GGCTGTGATGGCTTCTGCCAGGCTGGAGTTCCTCAG-3′ (for PDZ7LA). The model structures of the PDZ7 wild type, LA, and RS mutant domains of hINADL were built using the PSD-95-3 PDZ domain (Protein Data Bank code: 1be9) as template structure (17Bernstein F.C. Koetzle T.F. Williams G.J.B. Meyer E.F. Brice M.D. Rodgers J.R. Kennard O. Shimanouchi T. Tasumi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 112: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (8163) Google Scholar). Direct alignment of the two sequences gives an overall similarity of 61 and 47% identity. Modeling was carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 work station using the program InsightII (18Dayringer H.E. Tramontano A. Sprang S.R. Fletterick R.J. J. Mol. Graph. 1986; 4: 82-87Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The model was subjected to limited energy refinement (program Discover, steepest descent algorithm, Molecular Simulations S.a.r.l.). The SearchLoop Protein command was used to find suitable geometries for residue insertion in one loop of the defined model. The SURFNET procedure (19Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar) was used to measure the volumes of the cavities with minimum and maximum gap sphere radii equal to 1 and 4 Å, respectively. Details about the SPOT procedure were essentially as previously described (20Brannetti B. Via A. Cestra G. Cesareni G. Helmer-Citterich M. J. Mol.

The frequency of the residues in the contacting positions was deduced from the alignment of the carboxyl-terminal portions of the ligand peptides of each PDZ domain. We have assembled a new type of peptide repertoire in which nonapeptides of random sequence are fused to the carboxyl terminus of the D protein and are efficiently displayed on the surface of the λ phage capsid. To this end we have used a modified vector, λDsplay1 (14Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Combinatorial Chem. and High Throughput Screening. 2001; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) derived from λpRH825 phage constructed by Sternberg and Hoess (36Sternberg N. Hoess R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1609-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). λDsplay1 drives abundant and stable expression of recombinant D proteins, because one of the loxP sites flanking the D coding sequence and causing genetic instability in the original vector has been deleted. In assembled λ heads, ∼95% of the total D protein is chimeric, and the remaining 5% is synthesized by a second wild type gene (14Castagnoli L. Zucconi A. Quondam M. Rossi M. Vaccaro P. Panni S. Paoluzi S. Santonico E. Dente L. Cesareni G. Combinatorial Chem. and High Throughput Screening. 2001; 4: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal peptide library that we have constructed contains 107 independent clones, each displaying a different nonapeptide. This complexity is sufficient to ensure that all the possible tetrapeptides (1.6 × 106) are represented in the library. Since the four carboxyl-terminal residues in the target peptide make the main contacts with the PDZ domain (21Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 22Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), this repertoire represents a powerful tool to characterize PDZ peptide recognition specificity. The heterogeneity of the displayed peptides was verified by sequencing the 3′ ends of the D gene in randomly isolated phage clones. A minority of displayed peptides, whose degenerate sequence contains internal stop codons, were shorter than nine residues. To test the effectiveness of the approach, we performed a pilot panning experiment using as bait a PDZ domain whose recognition specificity has already been determined. We overexpressed the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 protein (37Stathakis D.G. Hoover K.B. You Z. Bryant P.J. Genomics. 1997; 1: 7-11Google Scholar) as fusion to GST, and we used it to select ligands from the λ displayed carboxyl-terminal repertoire. All selected peptides matched the carboxyl-terminal sequence of the natural partners (xT/SxV) (6Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 693-707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To identify the preferred ligands of each of the seven PDZ domains of the hINADL protein (12Philipp S. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we constructed a panel of GST fusion proteins, each expressing a different PDZ domain. Domain borders, determined on the basis of the Pfam v5.5 (39Sonnhammer E.L.L. Eddy S.R. Birney E. Bateman A. Durbin R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 320-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) sequence alignment, are indicated in Fig. 1, top. Purified fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose were used to pan the λ-displayed carboxyl-terminal library. Three selection cycles were sufficient to enrich the number of binding clones of at least 2 orders of magnitude. Phages sorted by panning experiments were further tested by solid phase immunoassay. The selected clones were subjected to DNA sequencing to deduce the amino acidic sequence of the exposed peptides; the sequences were aligned at the carboxyl terminus, and a consensus motif representing the ligands of each domain was derived (Fig. 1). In agreement with previous observations, conserved residues (in bold) were only found in the three/four positions preceding the carboxyl terminus (4Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Ligand peptides that share a carboxyl-terminal motif containing Ser or Thr at P−2, were defined as class I ligands, whereas class II ligands have hydrophobic or aromatic residues at that position (4Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). According to this criterion INADL-PDZ domains 1, 2, 3, and 4 were found to bind preferentially to class II, whereas PDZ domains 5, 6, and 7 bound to class I ligands. None of the INADL-PDZ domains showed a preference for class III peptides, characterized by acidic residues in P−2 (6Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). PDZ5 and PDZ6, however, besides the preferred Ser/Thr, also tolerate some acidic or hydrophobic residues at P−2. PDZ3 domain was assigned to a new specificity class, which we designated as class IV, because it was never described before. PDZ3 displays a preference for acidic residues in position P0 in a subgroup of its ligands (the other subgroup conforming to class II). Peptides belonging to either class were found to bind to the PDZ3 domain with comparable affinity, as judged by solid phase immunoassay (Fig. 2: peptides 3.16 and 3.17). In this respect PDZ3 is unique among the PDZ domains characterized so far, since most members of this domain family prefer hydrophobic residues at the P0 position. Close inspection of the peptide sequences aligned in Fig. 1indicates that, aside from the simplified distinction into classes, the seven domains display unique preferences. Peptides that bind to PDZ1 often have basic residues such as Arg or Lys at position P−3, (consensus [V/R]ΨWΦ*) (Ψ stands for aromatic, and Φ stands for hydrophobic residue). PDZ2 prefers Phe as the carboxyl-terminal residue and often selects acidic residues at position P−1 or P−3 (consensus EΨDF*). The peptides selected by PDZ3, by contrast, can be divided into two families; a subset of peptides conforms to type II with preference for Asp at P−1 (consensus ΨDΦ*), and the remaining peptides define the novel class IV (consensus Ψ[D/E]*). PDZ4 prefers aromatic, hydrophobic, and acidic residues at positions P−1, P−2, and P−3, respectively (consensus EΦΨV*). PDZ5 has a strong preference for Trp at P−1 (consensus [S/T]W[VL]*) and can bind peptides with Glu at P−2. The PDZ6 binding consensus is similar to the one of PDZ5 but shows a higher variability both at P−1 and P−2. At P−3 hydrophobic residues are preferred (consensus ΦSΨV*). Finally, PDZ7 is a canonical class I domain that has a marked preference for Ser at P−2 and Val at P0 and very little selectivity, if any, at P−1 and P−3 (consensus [S] × [V]*). To test the cross-reactivity of the different PDZ domains, we performed a solid phase immunoassay where two representative phage clones for each domain were challenged with all the remaining INADL-PDZ domains immobilized on a multi-well plate (Fig. 2). The analysis revealed that some peptides have a high specificity and only bind to one domain; others were found to be more promiscuous and reacted also with domains different from the one that originally selected them in the panning experiment. In most cases, cross-reacting domains, as defined by this test, belong to the same domain class. As expected, PDZ7 displayed the lowest specificity, accepting any peptide containing Ser or Thr at position P−2. By contrast, PDZ1 and PDZ4 are characterized by the highest selectivity and do not bind to any of the peptides selected by the other domains. To contribute to the characterization of the molecular basis of the binding specificity mediated by PDZ domains, we generated site-directed mutations in the PDZ7 domain, with the aim of altering its ligand preference and converting it into a domain with class II binding specificity.

It is associated with the early endosomes and leads, in concert with Rab4, to the enlargement of endosomes, resulting in the fusion of sorting and recycling endosomes. Our goal was to characterize the role of these various domains in Rabip4 subcellular localization and their function in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Although the FYVE finger domain specifically bound phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and was necessary for the function of Rabip4, it was not sufficient for the protein association with membranes. Indeed a protein containing the FYVE finger and the Rab4-binding site was cytosolic, whereas the total protein was mostly associated to the membrane fraction, whether or not cells were pretreated with wortmannin. By contrast, a construct corresponding to the N-terminal end, Rabip4-(1–212), and containing the RUN domain was membrane-associated. The complete protein partitioned between the Triton X-100-insoluble and -soluble fractions and a wortmannin treatment increased the amount of the protein in the Triton X-100 fraction. Rabip4-(1–212) was totally Triton X-100-insoluble, and confocal microscopic examination showed that it labeled not only the endosomes, positive for Rabip4, but also a filamentous network with a honeycomb appearance. The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction that contains Rabip4 did not correspond to the caveolin or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-enriched lipid rafts. Rabip4 did not appear directly linked to actin but seemed associated to the actin network. We propose that the subcellular localization of the protein is primarily driven by the RUN domain to endosomal microdomains characterized by Triton X-100 insolubility and that the FYVE domain and the Rab4-binding domain then allow for the recruitment of the protein to lipophilic microdomains enriched in phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate.

Cell. 1997; 8: 871-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which are characterized by an endosomal localization. This cysteine-rich domain specifically binds PtdIns(3)P (6Burd C.G. Emr S.D.

Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a property that is important for the intracellular localization of those proteins. Indeed, using a double FYVE finger construct, Gillooly et al. (14Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) very elegantly showed an enrichment of PtdIns(3)P on the surface of early endosomes and in the internal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes. In agreement with the association of EEA1 with endosomes through the binding of its FYVE finger to the PtdIns(3)P, a mutation in this domain causes the redistribution of EEA1 to the cytosol (15Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). However, the endosomal localization of EEA1 was also determined by its ability to bind Rab5 (16Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Hrs is another extensively studied FYVE finger-containing protein, implicated in both membrane trafficking and signal transduction (17Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 18Miura S. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kimura Y. Murata K. Sasaki Y. Hanai J.I. Beppu H. Tsukazaki T. Wrana J.L. Miyazono K. Sugamura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9346-9355Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It presents an endosomal localization, but results are more conflicting about the exact role of its FYVE finger in this localization (5Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In conclusion as reviewed in (5Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), there are no reports of a FYVE finger alone being sufficient to target a protein to a membrane, and additional interactions might be required. We also reported that the N-terminal part of Rabip4 presents 40% analogy with RPIP8 (Rap2-interacting protein 8) (19Janoueix-Lerosey I. Pasheva E. de Tand M. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and with the two KIAA 0871 and 1537 ((1) and data not shown). These proteins have been shown very recently to contain a RUN domain (for RPIP8,UNC-14, and NESCA) (20Callebaut I. de Gunsburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The RUN domain is organized into six conserved blocks, which are predicted to constitute the “core” of a globular structure. Although the role of this RUN domain is not known yet, it appears in several proteins that are particularly linked to the functions of GTPases of the Rap and Rab families (20Callebaut I. de Gunsburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The purpose of this work was to clarify the roles of the FYVE and RUN domains present in Rabip4. We found that the FYVE finger of Rabip4, although it specifically binds PtdIns(3)P in vitro, was insufficient for the endosomal localization of the protein. Furthermore, the N-terminal part containing the RUN domain appears to play a key role in directing the protein toward its cellular localization. Our results suggest that, within an endosome, Rabip4 divides between phospholipidic membrane microdomains through its FYVE finger and another type of microdomains characterized by their insolubility in a non-ionic detergent, perhaps through the RUN domain. Egg phosphatidylcholine, egg phosphatidylethanolamine, and brain phosphatidylserine were from Sigma. The phosphoinositides were from Echelon (Research Laboratories Inc. Salt Lake City, UT). Monoclonal antibodies against the Myc epitope (9E10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against caveolin, EEA1, and Rab4 were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Rabip4 antibodies (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were purified by affinity chromatography. Texas Red-coupled phalloidin was from Molecular Probes. Goat Texas Red-coupled antibodies to mouse immunoglobulins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Chemicals were from Sigma, and molecular biology reagents were from Biolabs, Life Technologies, Inc., and Qiagen. pEGFP-GPI encoded for a fusion protein between GFP and the glypiation signal of the decay-accelerating factor. The cDNAs for Rab4 Q67L, Rabip4, Rabip4-(1–212), and Rabip4-(401–600) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in a pcDNA3-myc vector (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to allow for the expression of Myc-tagged proteins at their N terminus. pEGFP-C1-Rabip4 was used for expression of Rabip4 as a C-terminal fusion with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The His554 and His555 of Rabip4 were replaced by leucine residues using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) in the construct encoding for GFP-Rabip4. Mutations were verified by sequencing. GST-Rabip4-(401–600) was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads from Escherichia colitransformed with pGEX-3X-Rabip4-(401–600) (21Bortoluzzi M.N. Cormont M. Gautier N. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 899-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The purified protein was resuspended in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and stored at −80 °C until use. Sucrose-loaded unilamellar phospholipid vesicles were prepared by the extrusion method (22Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) as modified by Paris et al. (23Paris S. Beraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, a dried film of phospholipids composed of 38–40% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylserine, 30% phosphatidylethanolamine supplemented or not with 2% phosphoinositides (PtdIns, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and PtdIns(3,5)P2) was formed in a Rotavapor and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm sucrose. The suspension was vortexed for 20 min and frozen-thawed five times. Unilamellar vesicles were produced by extrusion through 0.4-μm pore size polycarbonate filter (Isopore, Millipore). After extrusion, the sucrose-loaded vesicles were diluted 5 times in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mmMgCl2, centrifuged for 20 min at 400,000 ×g, and resuspended in the same buffer as GST-Rabip4-(401–600). GST-Rabip4-(401–600) (3 μm) was incubated for 15 min at 25 °C with 30 μg of sucrose-loaded lipid vesicles in a final volume of 75 μl. Following incubation, vesicles were recovered by ultracentrifugation at 400,000 × g for 15 min (TL100 Beckman centrifuge). The amount of Rabip4-(401–600) associated with the lipid vesicles was determined by Coomassie Blue staining following protein separation by SDS-PAGE. CHO cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected by electroporation. Cells were cultured for 2 days before use. A CHO cell line stably expressing GFP-Rabip4 was obtained by selection with G418 (500 μg/ml) and limited dilution of cells transfected with pEGFP-Rabip4 (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 16 h before each experiment. Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated as indicated in the legends to figures, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. When non-GFP fusion proteins have to be detected, cells are permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% fetal bovine serum. Coverslips were successively incubated with the primary antibodies and the appropriate Texas Red-coupled anti-species antibodies before they were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst Pharmaceuticals). The cells were examined by sequential excitation at 488 nm (GFP) and 568 nm (Texas Red) using a confocal microscope (TCS SP, Leica, Deerfield, IL) and a PL APO 63 × 1.40 oil objective (Leica). The images were then combined and merged by using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). CHO cells (2 preconfluent 100-mm dishes) were homogenized with a Thomas potter (type AA) in 300 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose, 125 mm KCl, and a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h (Optima X100 ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments) to separate the cytosol and the total membrane pellet. The pellet was then resuspended and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 300 μl of Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mmsucrose, and protease inhibitors with 1% Triton X-100 or 60 mm octylthioglucoside or 1 m NaCl or 4m urea or 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.5. The suspensions were then respun at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to separate the solubilized and the insoluble fractions. Proteins from equal volumes of homogenate, cytosol, or membrane-associated fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunodetection. Purification of lipid rafts was performed as described (24Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Seret-Delprat C. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. Manie S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3304-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 preconfluent 100-mm dishes) were lysed in 300 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA (TNE buffer), and 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. After 1 h at 4 °C, sucrose was added to get a 40% (w/v) solution. This mixture (800 μl) was sequentially overlaid with 2 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose and 1 ml of 4% sucrose and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h in an MLS 50 rotor (Optima Max centrifuge, Beckman Instruments). Fractions (300 μl) were recovered from the top of the tube and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Rabip4 and caveolin. Rabip4 is an endosomal protein containing the sequence C(2 X)C(8 X)(R/K)(R/K)HHCR XC(4 X)C(2 X)C(16 X)C(2 X)C characterizing a FYVE finger motif (shown in red in Fig. 1). This double zinc finger domain of Rabip4 is 18–52% identical to the FYVE finger of the mammalian proteins EEA1, Hrs, Ankhzn, SARA, Fgdl, PIKfyve, and Rabenosyn-5. The highest homology was found with EEA1 and the lowest one with Rabenosyn-5. The cysteine residues of the core motif involved in zinc binding are conserved. The essential nucleotides involved in the binding of EEA1 with PtdIns(3)P—1369RKHHC1373and the arginine residues at positions 1374 and 1399 (shown in green)— and the β1 and β2 strands are conserved with regard to those of EEA1 and thus likely form a β-hairpin (25Kutateladze T.G. Ogdurn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While the β4 strands of Rabip4 and EEA1 were identical, the β3 strand, proposed to form the second hairpin, was different (25Kutateladze T.G. Ogdurn K.D. Watson W.T. de Beer T. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. Overduin M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 805-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). By studying Rabip4 sequence with Pfam (Proteinfamily) data base, we detected the presence of a RUN domain between amino acids 33 and 163. We found the six conserved blocks characterizing the RUN domains (20Callebaut I. de Gunsburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that are also present in KIAA 1537, the likely human homologue of Rabip4, the Rap2 effector RPIP8 (19Janoueix-Lerosey I. Pasheva E. de Tand M. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the Rab6-interacting protein ORF37 (27Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). As described for other RUN domains, the percentage of identity between Rabip4/KIAA 1537 and RPIP8 or ORF37 is not important but the blocks are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids in conserved positions (20Callebaut I. de Gunsburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The secondary structure of the RUN domain was predicted to be essentially α-helices. Furthermore, the conserved basic residues in this predominantly all-α-fold might reveal a conserved tridimensional conformation that could be important for the function of the RUN domain. Since Rabip4 possesses a putative FYVE finger, we next determined whether it was able to bind PtdIns(3)P. Therefore, we measured the ability of GST-Rabip4-(401–600), a fusion protein between GST and the amino acids 401–600 of Rabip4, to bind to phospholipidic vesicles containing the different phosphatidylinositols (Fig. 2 A). GST-Rabip4-(401–600) bound to vesicles only when they contained PtdIns(3)P, whereas GST alone did not interact with these vesicles (data not shown). This binding was highly specific, since GST-Rabip4-(401–600) did not recognize vesicles containing the same amount of PtdIns, PtdIns(3,4)P2, or PtdIns(3,5)P2. Thus, the FYVE finger motif of Rabip4 specifically interacts with PtdIns(3)P. We then compared the behavior of a Rabip4 protein mutated on the FYVE finger (Rabip4 His554–His555) to the wild type Rabip4. We chose to mutate the His554 and His555 because the corresponding mutations in EEA1 abolished its ability to interact, in vitro, with the zinc molecules required for PtdIns(3)P binding and its endosomal localization (15Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.-H. D'Arrigo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 28Gaullier J.M. Ronning E. Gillooly D.J. Stenmark H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24595-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We compared confocal images obtained in CHO cells that expressed GFP-Rabip4 and GFP-Rabip4 His554–His555 to a similar level (Fig. 2 B, top panels). Both GFP fusion proteins labeled punctated structures. However, the size of these vesicles was smaller when the FYVE finger was not functional (Rabip4 His554–His555) than with Rabip4 WT. Rabip4 overexpression was shown previously to induce the appearance of enlarged vesicles (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the mutation within the FYVE finger altered the ability of Rabip4 to induce this phenomenon. To strengthen further the hypothesis that the FYVE finger was involved in the function of Rabip4, we analyzed the ability of Rabip4 His554–His555 to induce an enlargement of endosomal structures when coexpressed with active Rab4 (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the coexpression of Rabip4 with myc-Rab4 Q67L (a constitutively active form of Rab4) led to the expansion of endosomal structures in CHO cells (Fig. 2 B, right panels), such a similar enlargement was not induced by the expression of GFP-Rabip4 His554–His555 with active Rab4. It should be noted, however, that Rabip4 His554–His555 and active Rab4 are colocalized in slightly enlarged punctated structures (Fig. 2 B, left panels). Taken together, these observations suggest that the FYVE finger plays a role in the function of the protein since the mutant protein did not induce a marked enlargement of the endosome, but that overexpression of the mutated protein can partially compensate for this loss of function. To determine the cellular distribution of Rabip4, CHO cells were homogenized and the membrane-associated fraction (pellet) and the cytosol were obtained by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3 A). Equal relative amounts of homogenate and both fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE before immunodetection of Rabip4. This antibody detects an endogenous protein of 68 kDa migrating with the same apparent molecular weight as the overexpressed protein (Fig. 3 A, top panel). Despite its hydrophilic character, endogenous or overexpressed Rabip4, similar to Rab4, was mainly associated with the membrane fraction, with only low amounts detected in the cytosol. To determine the nature of the association between Rabip4 and membranes, the pellet fractions obtained from control or Rabip4 overexpressing cells were submitted to various treatments,i.e. 1% Triton X-100, 60 mmβ-octylthioglucoside, 1 m NaCl, 4 m urea, or 10 mm Na2CO3, pH 10.5 (Fig. 3 A). Rabip4 was partly resistant to the detergents (Triton X-100 and β-octylthioglucoside), whereas Rab4 was efficiently solubilized. The interactions between Rabip4 or Rab4 and the membrane fraction were highly resistant to high ionic strength and chaotropic agents. By contrast, a Na2CO3, pH 10.5, treatment detached Rabip4 from the pelleted fraction, whereas the geranylgeranyl membrane-anchored protein Rab4 was still present in the membrane fraction. These observations indicated that Rabip4 is a peripheral protein tightly associated with membranes as well as with Triton X-100-insoluble structures. Since the Rabip4 FYVE finger was able to bind PtdIns(3)P, we determined that interaction was needed for targeting Rabip4 to the membrane fraction. Therefore, CHO cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 myc-Rabip4-(401–600), a construct that contains the FYVE finger and the Rab4-binding domain (Fig. 3 B). Following homogenization, myc-Rabip4-(401–600) was found predominantly in the cytosol, although a small but significant part of myc-Rabip4-(401–600) was associated with the membrane fraction. Similar observations were made with Rabip4-(540–600) that contains only the FYVE finger (data not shown). These results indicate that the interactions with Rab4 and PtdIns(3)P are not sufficient to stabilize the protein association with the membranes. We then tested whether the RUN domain in the N-terminal region of Rabip4 was involved in this process. To approach the role of this domain, we looked at the subcellular distribution of myc-Rabip4-(1–212), a protein corresponding to the N-terminal part of Rabip4, which was found associated to the pellet fraction (Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that the N-terminal region of Rabip4 was involved in the subcellular localization of Rabip4. To confirm that the FYVE finger was not sufficient for the targeting of Rabip4 to the membrane-associated fraction, CHO cells expressing myc-Rabip4 were treated or not with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PtdIns(3)kinase. Cells were then either fractionated into cytosol and membrane pellets or analyzed by confocal microscopy. Both analyses indicated that wortmannin did not modify the association of Rabip4 with the membrane fraction, whereas it induced the redistribution of EEA1 from the pellet to the cytosol (Fig. 4 A). We reported previously (Fig. 3) that the myc-Rabip4 protein associated with the membrane pellet was only partly detergent-soluble. We studied whether a wortmannin treatment modified this property. The membrane-associated fraction obtained from control or wortmannin-treated cells was treated with 1% Triton X-100 before recovering the soluble and insoluble fractions by ultracentrifugation and analyzing equal amounts of both fractions by SDS-PAGE. As visible in Fig. 4, A and B, a wortmannin treatment of the cells yielded a marked enrichment of myc-Rabip4 in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Thus, the association between Rabip4 and the Triton X-100-soluble material (probably the lipid membrane bilayers) requires an interaction between Rabip4 FYVE finger and PtdIns(3)P since it is sensitive to wortmannin. In parallel, we observed, by confocal microscopy, that wortmannin modified the labeling given by GFP-Rabip4. In control cells, GFP-Rabip4 labeled punctated structures uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, as also observed in Fig. 2 B. By contrast, in wortmannin-treated cells, GFP-Rabip4 was present in smaller structures, similar to those observed with GFP-Rabip4 His554–His555 (Fig. 2 B), forming sort of “honeycomb” network (Fig. 4 C). To determine which domain of Rabip4 was required for its association with the Triton X-100-insoluble material, we examined whether Rabip4-(1–212), which appears to trigger Rabip4 association to the membranes, was also responsible for the partial Triton X-100 insolubility. CHO cells expressing myc-Rabip4-(1–212) were submitted to subcellular fractionation, and the pellet was treated with 1% Triton X-100. Solubilized and non-solubilized material was then analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Myc antibody. The totality of the membrane-associated myc-Rabip4-(1–212) was recovered in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 5 A). To strengthen the fact that the amino acids 1–212 of Rabip4 were involved in the targeting of Rabip4 to its intracellular localization, we looked for the colocalization of Rabip4 and Rabip4-(1–212) when overexpressed in CHO cells (Fig. 5 B). We observed that GFP-Rabip4 was colocalized with myc-Rabip4-(1–212) in punctated structures as indicated by their yellow color, with very few green structures containing only GFP-Rabip4. Further myc-Rabip4-(1–212) labeling defined a filamentous network giving rise to a honeycomb appearance as emphasized in the enlarged square of Fig. 5 B and already visible in Fig. 4 C in cells treated with wortmannin. Taken together, these results suggest that the N-terminal part of Rabip4 first determines the subcellular localization of the protein, whereas other domains, such as the FYVE finger, might be secondary to other types of interactions around its previous localization. In accordance with the fact that the FYVE finger of Rabip4 was not the only determinant for its endosomal localization, we noticed that EEA1 and GFP-Rabip4 define different microdomains at the level of the same endosomal vesicles (Fig. 6). Although GFP-Rabip4 was present together with EEA1 in the same endosomes (nearly all the vesicles were positive for both GFP-Rabip4 and EEA1), we observed at a higher magnification that EEA1 (red) and GFP-Rabip4 (green) labeled different regions within endosomes. By contrast, GFP-Rabip4 and Rab4 uniformly labeled the endosomes that were enlarged by the overexpression of wild type Rab4. Similar types of observations have already led to the conclusion that in the same endosomal vesicle Rab5 (whose effector is EEA1) and Rab4 were present in distinct microdomains (29Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Riedorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are microdomains found at the plasma membrane and intracellular membrane organelles, which are experimentally recovered in a detergent-insoluble fraction (30Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To test whether Rabip4 was present in these microdomains, we first searched for a colocalization of Rabip4 with proteins known to be enriched in lipid rafts (Fig. 7). By immunofluorescence confocal analysis, we found that GFP-Rabip4 (green) did not colocalize with endogenous caveolin (red) and that myc-Rabip4 (red) did not colocalize either with a GFP-GPI-anchored protein (green). Furthermore, when lipid rafts were purified by a flotation assay, endogenous caveolin floated on the sucrose cushion while Rabip4 remained at the bottom of the tube (Fig. 7 B). Actin cytoskeleton is characterized by its Triton X-100 insolubility. To determine whether Rabip4 was associated with actin filaments, CHO cells expressing GFP-Rabip4 were treated or not with the F-actin depolymerizing agent, latrunculin B (31Spector I. Braet F. Shochet N.R. Bubb M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8 A, although latrunculin B led to the disappearance of F-actin, GFP-Rabip4 labeled, as in control cells, punctated structures scattered throughout the cytoplasm of cells, which appeared smaller due to the disruption of actin cytoskeleton (Fig. 8 A, right). Latrunculin B did not modify either the subcellular localization of Rabip4 or the amount of the protein found in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction (Fig. 8 A, left). Furthermore, all attempts to copurify actin filaments and Rabip4 were negative (data not shown). This series of results argues strongly against a direct interaction between F-actin and Rabip4. By contrast to latrunculin B, cytochalasin D does not totally disrupt F-actin, but induces its fragmentation in small filaments and its clustering in several regions of the cytoplasm (31Spector I. Braet F. Shochet N.R. Bubb M. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 B). In parallel, we observed a redistribution of GFP-Rabip4-containing vesicles when cells were treated with cytochalasin D. Furthermore, GFP-Rabip4-containing structures are enriched in the same region where F-actin was clustered. Taken together, these observations indicate that, although Rabip4 does not directly interfere with actin-filaments, Rabip4-containing vesicles might be linked to actin cytoskeleton. We have characterized the implication of various domains of Rabip4 for the protein subcellular localization and function. A series of evidences suggest that the FYVE finger of Rabip4 and the Rab4-binding region are not sufficient to trigger the protein to its endosomal localization, although they play a role in its ability to enlarge the size of early endosomes. First, the protein was associated to endosomes, even when null mutations were performed into the FYVE finger, as evidenced by confocal microscopy or following fractionation (data not shown). However, these mutations are not silent since the inactivation of the FYVE finger decreases the ability of Rabip4 to enlarge endosomes when expressed together with active Rab4. Second, the C terminus of Rabip4, Rabip4-(401–600), which contains the FYVE finger and the Rab4-binding domain, is cytosolic. Third, a wortmannin treatment that decreases the intracellular level of PtdIns(3)P does not increase the amount of Rabip4 in the cytosol, whereas a similar treatment inhibits the endosomal localization of EEA1 (16Lawe D.C.

Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Miaczynska M. Dewitte F. Wilm M. Hoflack B. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the FYVE finger of Rabip4 was not the major determinant for its endosomal localization. Thus we observed that Rabip4 and EEA1 are not totally colocalized within a single endosomal vesicle. This highly suggests that another domain(s) of Rabip4 was responsible for its association with endosomal microdomains that do not necessarily contain PtdIns(3)P. It should be noted that this endosomal localization was not due either to the protein region implicated in the Rab4 interaction since, as noted above, Rabip4-(401–600) contains both the FYVE finger and amino acid sequences needed for Rab4 binding (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and is cytosolic. Our results point to an important role of the N-terminal domain of Rabip4 in the subcellular localization of the protein. We show that the N-terminal part of Rabip4 (amino acids 1–212) not only associates with endosomes containing Rabip4 but also with a network of filaments presenting a honeycomb organization. It was also responsible for the partial insolubility of Rabip4 by non-ionic detergents. This part of the molecule contains the newly described RUN domain, which was predicted to constitute the “core” of a globular structure that possibly interacts with other partners. Since it was found in RPIP8, a protein that interacts with the small GTPase Rap2 (19Janoueix-Lerosey I. Pasheva E. de Tand M. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in a Rab6 effector (ORF37) (27Janoueix-Lerosey I. Jollivet F. Camonis J. Marche P. Goud B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14801-14808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and in proteins containing FYVE finger (including Rabip4), it has been proposed that the RUN domain might play a role in relation to small GTPase signaling (20Callebaut I. de Gunsburg J. Goud B. Mornon J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 79-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It was suggested that it could be of use to bind small GTPases, since the RUN domain of RPIP8 was interacting with Rap2. It is perhaps not the function of a RUN domain to bind a GTPase, since the RUN domain of Rabip4 does not bind any form of Rab4 (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), Rab5, and Rab11, 2M. Mari, Y. Le Marchand-Brustel, and M. Cormont, unpublished observations. the three Rabs enriched in early endosomes, nor Rap2 (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In view of our results, we suggest that the RUN domain might be responsible for an interaction with a filamentous network of an unidentified nature but is probably linked to the actin cytoskeleton, since the disorganization of actin by cytochalasin D profoundly modified the labeling obtained with Rabip4. The proteins that form these filaments are not known yet but would also be present at the surface of endosomes since Rabip4-(1–212) was colocalized with Rabip4 WT on endosomes. This colocalization was not due to a dimerization of the two proteins. Indeed, while Rabip4 homodimerized in the yeast two-hybrid system, Rabip4 WT and (1) did not.2 As discussed above, the FYVE finger and the Rab4-binding site are not sufficient for the association of Rabip4 with endosomes, although those domains play a role in the partitioning of the proteins between the detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. In the presence of wortmannin, most of the protein is Triton X-100-insoluble. Furthermore, both Rabip4 mutated on the FYVE finger and Rapib4Δ-(507–517), a form of Rabip4 unable to interact with active Rab4 (1Cormont M. Mari M. Galmiche A. Hofman P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1637-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), are found only in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction.2 The amounts of Rabip4 present in the membrane detergent extracts are tightly dependent on the presence of PtdIns(3)P and probably of Rab4. Both types of interaction are required since the destruction of only one of these interactions renders Rabip4 totally detergent-insoluble. This would indicate that either the binding of Rabip4 to PtdIns(3)P through its FYVE finger is required for a subsequent interaction with Rab4, as described for Rab5 and EEA1 (16Lawe D.C. Patki V. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3699-3705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), or that the binding of Rabip4 with active Rab4 stabilizes the interaction between the FYVE domain and PtdIns(3)P. We suggest that Rabip4 is triggered in endosomal microdomains enriched in some unidentified cytoskeletal elements. This localization would allow for an efficient recruitment of Rabip4 to the PtdIns(3)P-enriched area of the endosomes (14Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4577-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) and for a concomitant recruitment of active Rab4 to permit the enlargement of endosomes. We don't know yet whether the filamentous structures are necessary for some intracellular movements of endosomes or if they are only needed for a correct targeting of Rabip4. More studies will be necessary to get a better knowledge of the potential partners and/or roles of the RUN domains. We thank A. Galmiche (INSERM U452, Nice, France) for the gift of GFP-GPI.

Sleisenger M.H. Fordtran J.S. Gastrointestinal Disease Pathophysiology/Diagnosis/Management. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1993: 127-149Google Scholar). In addition, bile acid excretion represents a major mechanism of cholesterol catabolism. The orderly movement of bile acids through the enterohepatic circulation is dependent upon an asymmetric array of vectorial transporters, which are located in the liver and intestine. A key member of this set of transporters is the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT),1 which is found on the apical surface of ileal enterocytes, renal proximal convoluted tubule cells, and large cholangiocytes (2Wong M.H.

Complete disruption of this process leads to congenital primary bile acid malabsorption (7Heubi J.E. Balistreri W.F. Fondacaro J.D. Partin J.C. Schubert W.K.

In contrast, to the well established physiological function of ASBT in the intestine, the importance of ASBT expression in renal and bile duct epithelial cells remains uncertain. No biliary or renal phenotype has been described in children with defects in the ASBT gene. Regulation of ASBT expression is complex and has only been examined in recent descriptive studies. In the rat ileum, ASBT undergoes a biphasic pattern of regulation during normal development, with a fetal onset of expression, early post-natal down-regulation, followed by marked up-regulation at the time of weaning (3Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Christie D.M. Dawson P.A. Thevananther S. Shneider B.L. Am. J.

In contrast, renal expression of ASBT is constitutive during the same developmental stages. The basis of the ileal regulation appears to be both transcriptional and post-transcriptional. ASBT has a distinct pattern of expression along the longitudinal axis of the intestine with a restriction of its expression to the terminal 30% of the small bowel (14Coppola C.P. Gosche J.R. Arrese M. Ancowitz B. Madsen J. Vanderhoof J. Shneider B.L. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1172-1178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The bile acid responsiveness of the ASBT gene is a subject of unresolved controversy and may be species and experimental-condition specific (15Lillienau J. Crombie D.L. Munoz J. Longmire-Cook S.J.

Intestinal inflammation appears to down-regulate ASBT expression, while glucocorticoid administration leads to up-regulation (21Sundaram U. Wisel S. Stengelin S. Kramer W. Rajendran V. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1259-G1265PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nowicki M. Shneider B. Paul J. Heubi J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G197-G203PubMed Google Scholar). Given the overall importance of ASBT function in health and human disease, precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms of its regulation is of great importance. Exploitation of endogenous mechanisms of up- and down-regulation of this gene will provide novel approaches to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and hypercholesterolemia, respectively. Identification of key elements involved in directing ileal-specific expression of ASBT will lead to new ways to treat patients with short gut, where ileal function has been irreversibly lost. Similarly, identification of elements involved in the developmental regulation of ASBT expression will lead to new methods to care for premature infants, where intestinal function is immature. The human and rabbit ASBT 5′-flanking regions have been cloned (GenBankTM accession number AJ002005) (8Oelkers P. Kirby L.C. Heubi J.E. Dawson P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1880-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 23Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Recent knock-out studies have shown that hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α (HNF-1α) is critical for basal expression of ASBT (24Shih D. Bussen M. Sehayek E. Ananthanarayanan M. Shneider B. Suchy F. Shefer S. Bollileni J. Gonzalez F. Breslow J. Stoffel M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The following investigations provide a further description of the transcriptional machinery of the ASBT gene. A rat P1 genomic library (25Sternberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) was screened using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ASBT cDNA-derived oligonucleotide primers (sense primer 5′-CGAAGGTGATTCCTGCCTAG-3′, antisense primer 5′-CAGCAACCCATAATTAGCACC-3′; Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis MO). One of three positive clones was purified, digested with eitherHindIII or BamHI, and subcloned into a pZeROTM-1 vector (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Ninety-six randomly selected subclones of each digest were spotted onto nitrocellulose and screened by Southern blotting using three different cDNA probes generated from ASBT clone BS32C2 (4Christie D.M. Dawson P.A. Thevananther S. Shneider B.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G377-G385PubMed Google Scholar). The insert in clone BS32C2 was released by digestion with KpnI andPstI and was subsequently digested with EcoRI andBamHI to yield 679-, 1206-, and 310-bp fragments which represented the 5′, middle, and 3′ portions, respectively, of the ASBT cDNA. Selected positive genomic clones were sequenced on both strands using a series of synthetic oligonucleotides,AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, and an ABI 373A automated sequencing system (ABI, Foster City, CA) (26Connell C. Fung S. Heiner C. Bridgham J. Chakerian V. Heron E. Jones B. Menchen S. Mordan W. Raff M. Recknor M. Smith L. Springer J. Woo S. Hunkapiller M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 342-348Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed at the William Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, New Haven, CT. Genomic sequence was compared with previously published cDNA sequence (Fig. 1) to determine the intron/exon organization of the rat ASBT gene (3Shneider B.L. Dawson P.A. Christie D.M. Hardikar W. Wong M.H. Suchy F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 745-754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequence analysis was performed using software of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). Mapping of the site of polyadenylation of the ASBT gene was determined by Northern blot analysis of rat ileal RNA using ApaLI/HindIII andSspI/ScaI fragments of ASBT genomic clone BSB2F (Fig. 1). Caco-2 (HTB-37), HepG2 (HB-8065), MDCK (CCL-34) and HeLa-S3 (CCL-2.2) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Caco-2, a human colon cancer cell line, was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mg/ml human transferrin, and 10% fetal calf serum. The human liver tumor cell line HepG2 and the dog renal tubular epithelial cells MDCK were maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal calf serum. HeLa-S3 cells were cultured in Ham's F12K medium with 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. Primer extension assays were carried out in order to identify the ASBT transcription initiation site within the 5′-flanking sequence (27Jones K.A. Yamamoto K.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1985; 42: 559-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The primer was a 27-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GCTAGTATGTCAGTTTCAAGAGGCTGC-3′) which hybridizes 180 bp upstream of the translational initiation codon (Fig.2). Fifteen µg of total cellular RNA, extracted from rat ileum epithelial cells, was utilized as a template. The extension products were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel and compared with the dideoxy sequencing reaction of plasmid BSB1C (Fig. 1). To define ciselements involved in the regulation of ASBT expression, the rat ASBT 5′-flanking sequence and its subfragments were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI), upstream of a firefly luciferase gene. A 3.1-kilobase (kb)BglII/NcoI fragment containing the largest (2.7 kb) rat genomic ASBT 5′-flanking region (ASBT 5′) was derived from clone BSB1C. The hybrid construct pGL3-ASBT5′/−2685/+384(Fig. 2, construct a) was generated by cloning this fragment into the pGL3-Basic plasmid in an orientation such that the sense strand DNA of the firefly luciferase gene was transcribed. Based on pGL3-ASBT5′/−2685/+384, ASBT 5′-deletion/hybrid constructs were prepared, in order to localize transcriptional ciselements. The construct pGL3-ASBT5′/−2685/−830 (Fig. 2,construct b) was made by insertion of an upstream 1.9-kb sequence of the ASBT 5′ region into the polylinker of the pGL3-Basic vector. pGL3-ASBT5′/−829/+384 (Fig. 2, construct c), was prepared by insertion of a downstreamXhoI/NcoI 1.2-kb fragment containing 0.8-kb of the ASBT 5′ sequence. Based upon the transcription initiation sites that were found by primer extension assay, two DNA fragments with 496 bp (P2) and 327 bp (P3), respectively, were generated by PCR, using BSB1C plasmid as a template. Constructs were sequenced to confirm the veracity of the amplification process. P2 and P3 contain the sequences flanking both sides of, and including, a TATA box, the transcription initiation sites and two AP-1 cis elements (Fig. 2, constructs dand e). These two fragments were then subcloned intoXhoI/HindIII-nicked pGL3-Basic, forming the constructs pGL3-ASBT5′/−378/+118 and pGL3-ASBT5′/−208/+118, respectively. In order to precisely localize the cis element in ASBT 5′-flanking region, six DNA oligonucleotides (C1-C6) of 54–55 bp corresponding to different portions of P3 sequence (Fig. 2, P3 subfragments) were synthesized and tested for the trans-acting factor binding activity by band-shift assay. Additional 15-bp oligonucleotides were used to further define the cis- and trans-acting elements. The site-directed point mutagenesis of ASBT 5′-flanking region was performed by a QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), targeting to two AP-1 ciselements contained in P3 DNA fragment corresponding to the ASBT 5′-flanking region, positioned from −208 to +118 (28Vandeyar M.A. Weiner M.P.

A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotide primers, P3mu-1 and P3mu-2 were synthesized, with sequences of 5′- GCCAATAAATGATTGATTATAACTTTCTGTCTTGG-3′ and 5′-GGACTTTTTATATTTATTATTTGTGC-3′, respectively, which contained mutations as shown by underlined nucleotides (A ↔ G, T ↔ C). The third primer P3mu-3 is the combination of the sequences and mutations of the primers P3mu-1 and P3mu-2. The PCR products, pGL3-ASBT5′/P3M1, pGL3-ASBT5′/P3M2, and pGL3-ASBT5′/P3M3, were examined for their sizes by electrophoresis, and the produced point mutations contained within the P3 fragment were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Confluent cells (5 × 106/plate) were harvested and resuspended in 700 µl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 4 µg of the ASBT5′/luciferase hybrid plasmid constructs and 0.1 µg of a quantitation control plasmid containing a thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection was accomplished by electroporation (30Chu G. Hayakawa H. Berg P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1311-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) at 0.22 kV and 0.95 µF × 1,000 (Bio-Rad). After electroporation, the cells were resuspended in culture medium and returned to a plate for culturing for 40 h before dual luciferase assays (Promega, Madison, WI) using standard techniques as recommended by the manufacturer (31Parsons S.J. Rhodes S.A. Connor H.E. Rees S. Brown J. Giles H. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The effect of c-Jun on promoter activity was assessed by co-transfection of a cytomegalovirus promoter driven c-Jun expression construct (32Brown P. Kim S. Wise S. Sabichi A. Birrer M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1013-1021PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent cells or rat ileal mucosal scrapings using previously described techniques (33Chen F.Y. Harris L.C. Remack J.S. Brent T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4348-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were aliquoted into vials, quick-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. Five micrograms of nuclear proteins were incubated, with the appropriate 32P-labeled ASBT 5′-flanking DNA fragments or oligonucleotides (34Chen F.Y. Amara F.M. Wright J.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Srinivas P. Vijayakumar M. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 262-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). For band supershift analysis, specific antibodies were added together with the DNA probe and protein samples. Following digestion with 1 µl (127 units/µl, Life Technologies, Inc.) of DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min, samples were subjected to electrophoresis in a 7% native polyacrylamide gel. The rat small intestine was divided into four equal segments (proximal jejunum, distal jejunum, proximal ileum, and distal ileum) for analysis of the regional specificity in the rat small intestine. Rat terminal ileum (distal 25% of small intestine) was obtained from 10 (pre-weaning) and 28 (post-weaning)-day-old rats in order to assess developmental stage specificity. DNA-protein binding reactions were carried out as described above, using 2 × 105 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA fragments or oligonucleotides and 5 µg of nuclear protein per reaction. Following incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, 1 µl of DNase I (127 units/µl) was added to the reaction mixture in order to digest the unbound DNA fragments. Reaction mixtures were transferred to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and irradiated on ice by UV light at 1,200 microjoules for 7 min, using a UV-Stratalinker chamber apparatus (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Transcriptional analysis required elucidation of the genomic organization of the ASBT gene and cloning/sequencing of its 5′-flanking region. The ASBT gene extends over ∼17 kb and consists of six exons and five introns (Fig.1 and TableI). Primer extension analysis using ileal total RNA identified two potential sites of transcription initiation, which were 323 (genomic ASBT bp = −68) and 255 (genomic ASBT bp = 0) bp from the translation start site (Figs.2 and 3). A TATA box is located between these two sites (−12 to −9). Approximately 2800 bp of the 5′-flanking sequence have been cloned, sequenced, and utilized for the transcriptional studies described here (GenBankTM accession number AF285154). The sizes of the intronic regions of the ASBT gene were confirmed by a series of PCR reactions utilizing rat genomic DNA (data not shown). The entire 3.1 kb of 3′-untranslated sequence was found in a single intron (GenBankTM Accession number U07183). The first potential conserved polyadenylation signal was found 3116 bp from the cDNA stop codon (36Proudfoot N. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Two additional polyadenylation signals were found in the immediate 3′ region of the ASBT gene. Northern blot analysis of ileal total RNA mapped the polyadenylation signal to the first of these three potential sites (Fig.4).Table IIntron/exon boundaries and splice sites for the rat ASBT gene3′ Splice acceptor5′ Splice acceptorIntronExonExon No. = bpExonIntronIntron length (kb)TATTTC orExon 1 = 699TAGTTTExon 1 = 631ACCTCAGgtaaga5.7ttcagTGTTAGExon 2 = 119GCATTGgtaagt0.9tgttagGCATTTCExon 3 = 89CTTAAAgtaagt0.7ttccagATTGGAExon 4 = 176GGTACAGgtatga2.0tcccagGTGCCGExon 5 = 158TAGGAAgtaagg3.3ttacagTGTATGExon 6 = 3238AAATAGacacThe splice sites, intron and exon sizes of the ASBT gene are listed.

A luciferase reporter assay system was utilized in order to investigate the promoter function of the ASBT 5′-flanking region. ASBT5′/luciferase hybrid constructs were made using a pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) which contains a firefly luciferase coding region as a reporter gene. Caco-2 cells were chosen as transfectants for reporter gene assays since they are an intestinally derived cell line and support sodium-dependent bile acid transport activity (37Chandler C.E. Zaccaro L.M. Moberly J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G1118-1125PubMed Google Scholar). They also express ASBT transcripts (data not shown) and thus have the necessary factors for ASBT transcription. Cells transfected with pGL3-Basic and pGL3-SV40 were employed as negative and positive controls, respectively, with the latter containing an SV40 promoter-driven firefly luciferase gene. Calibration of transfection efficiency was achieved by co-transfection of cells with pRL-TK plasmids that express Ranilla luciferase. To test whether ASBT5′ has promoter activity, reporter gene assays were carried out initially using the full-length ASBT5′ construct pGL3-ASBT5′/−2684/+384 (Fig. 2, construct a). Results demonstrated that the cloned genomic ASBT5′ sequence possessed significant transcriptional activity, which was 61% of that of SV40 promoter, as reflected by luciferase activities (Fig.5, panel A). The transcriptional activity of the downstream 0.8-kb ASBT 5′ sequence (pGL3-ASBT5′/−829/+384) was 22% of that of the full-length 5′ sequence, however, still 30 times higher than that of the control construct pGL3-Basic which contains no promoter sequence. No luciferase activity was detected in cells transfected with pGL3-Basic as well as pGL3-ASBT5′/−2685/−830 (data not shown) compared with the background measurement, indicating that the upstream 1.9-kb sequence has no transcriptional activity. Since a number of intestinal promoters have key regulatory elements near the transcription initiation start site, the proximal promoter of ASBT was carefully characterized. Two ASBT5′-related DNA fragments P2 and P3 with 496 bp (ASBT5′ nucleotide positions −378 to +118) and 327 bp (ASBT 5′ nucleotide positions −208 to +118), respectively, were generated by PCR and sequenced. Both fragments contain the transcription initiation sites and TATA box, and are part of the downstream 0.8-kb 5′ sequence which showed transcriptional activity (Fig. 2, construct c). P2 and P3 possess 40 and 34%, respectively, of the transcriptional activity of the full-length 5′ sequence (Fig. 5, panel A). To test the hypothesis that trans-acting factors exist that can bind to cis-element(s) of ASBT5′, a band-shift assay was carried out initially with nuclear proteins extracted from Caco-2 cells and32P-labeled ASBT 5′ sequences, which included P2 and P3. Four DNA-ASBT-binding protein (ABP1-ABP4) complexes were detected as shown in the panel Bof Fig. 5. Furthermore, a cross-linking assay was performed with radiolabeled P3 as the probe to measure the molecular weights of the ABPs found by the band-shift analysis. As shown in panel Cof Fig. 5, four protein bands were detected with apparent molecular weights of 100,000, 73,000, 70,000, and 43,000. To determine ABPs DNA binding specificity, the unlabeled P2 was tested for the ability to compete for ABPs binding to the32P-labeled P2 sustrate. Preincubation of Caco-2 nuclear proteins with an unlabeled 1.2-kb fragment of the ASBT 5′-flanking region (−829 to +384) followed by addition of the radiolabeled P2 substrate, resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the formation of the DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 5, panel D). Binding of ABP2 and ABP4 were markedly affected, with lesser but substantial effect observed for ABP1 and ABP3. Addition of up to 2 nm nonspecific competitor, a 1.2-kb XbaI fragment of pGL3-Basic plasmid had no effect on the complex formation (Fig. 5, panel D), indicating that the DNA-protein interactions are specific. Further evidence of the specificity of the interaction is the fact that no nuclear proteins were bound by a radiolabeled XbaI fragment of the pGL3-Basic plasmid (Fig.5, panel B, Control). Furthermore, the DNA-ABPs binding characteristics were examined. DNase I pretreatment of radiolabeled P3 inhibited the formation of ABPs-DNA complexes (data not shown) excluding the possibility of nonspecific [32P]dCTP binding to ABPs. It was also shown that pretreatment of the nuclear preparation with either proteinase K or SDS could abolish the binding to P3 (data not shown), indicating that the binding activity of ABPs is proteinase K and SDS sensitive. These results confirm that the complexes detected by the band-shift assay are composed of DNA and polypeptides. To determine further the cis-element(s) of ASBT5′, six DNA fragments (Fig. 2, C1-C6) of 54–55 bp corresponding to different portions of P3 sequence were synthesized, radiolabeled, and incubated with the nuclear extracts for band-shift assay. Interestingly, we found that one of the ABPs, ABP2, only bound to C4 and C5, but failed to bind to other fragments (Fig.6, panel A), suggesting that these two fragments may contain the cis-element(s) which interact with the trans-acting factor. Further analysis of the cis-element(s) existing within P3 was carried out using MacVector software and transcription factor data bases. P3 contained two AP-1 cis-elements (ASBT5′ nucleotide positions −30 to −24 and +20 to +26, respectively). The proximal site (upstream = uAP-1) was located immediately upstream of the TATA box and the lower transcription initiation site. The distal AP-1 site (downstream = dAP-1) was located 18 nucleotides downstream of the lower transcription site (Fig. 2, construct a). Furthermore, the upper (5′-sided) AP-1 cis-element was contained in C4 and the lower (3′-sided) one contained in C5 fragment (Fig. 2, P3 subfragments). This finding was consistent with the result obtained in the band-shift assay, where we showed that ABP2 only bound to C4 and C5 and not the rest of the P3-related subfragments tested, as described above (Fig. 6, panel A). These findings strongly suggested that AP-1 played a key role in the transcriptional regulation of the ASBT gene. This was confirmed by examination of plasmid constructs containing the AP-1-mutated P3, which were generated by a QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pGL3-ASBT5′/P3M1 and pGL3-ASBT5′/P3M2 contained point-mutated upstream and downstream AP-1 element, respectively, each with other elements in normal"
https://openalex.org/W2041864772,"Serine/arginine protein kinases have been conserved throughout evolution and are thought to play important roles in the regulation of mRNA processing, nuclear import, germline development, polyamine transport, and ion homeostasis. Human SRPK1, which was first identified as a kinase specific for the SR family of splicing factors, is located on chromosome 6p21.2-p21.3. We report here the cloning and characterization of SRPK1a, which is encoded by an alternatively processed transcript derived from the SRPK1gene. SRPK1a contains an insertion of 171 amino acids at its NH2-terminal domain and is similar to SRPK1 in substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Moreover, both isoforms can induce alternative splicing of human tau exon 10 in transfected cells. Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the extended NH2-terminal domain of SRPK1a interacts with Scaffold Attachment Factor-B, a nuclear scaffold-associated protein. Confirmation of this interaction was provided by in vitrobinding assays, as well as by co-immunoprecipitation from 293T cells doubly transfected with SRPK1a and SAF-B. Our studies suggest that different SRPK family members are uniquely regulated and targeted and thus the multiple SRPK kinases present in higher eukaryotes may perform specialized and differentiable functions.

To date, at least nine distinct genes encoding SR protein kinases have been identified in the genomes of mammals (human SRPK1, GenBank™ accession number U09564;human SRPK2, U88666A; mouse SRPK1, AJ224115;mouse SRPK2, B006036), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sky1, S55098; Schizosaccharomyces pombe Dsk1, D13447), fruit fly (Drosophila SRPK1, AF01149), nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans SPK-1, AF241656), and plants (Arabidopsis thaliana SRPK1, AJ292978). Mammalian SRPK1 and SRPK2, which are highly related in sequence, kinase activity, and substrate specificity, were initially purified and cloned on the basis of their ability to phosphorylate members of the SR family of splicing factors in vitro and mediate splicing factor redistribution during the cell cycle (1Gui J.-F.

Commun. 1998; 242: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SR proteins themselves constitute a highly conserved protein family that is intimately involved in the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and other steps of RNA metabolism (for reviews, see Refs. 5Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 6Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 7Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 296-301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies demonstrated that SR proteins are required at multiple steps in the assembly of the spliceosome, the dynamic RNA-protein complex that catalyzes intron removal (8Fu X.-D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L.

Because RS domains are known to participate in protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions during spliceosome assembly, phosphorylation of these domains can modulate interactions involving SR proteins and is, therefore, essential for their function in constitutive splicing (3Wang H.-Y Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 737-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 11Valcárcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R.

Furthermore, phosphorylation of SR proteins leads to their release from nuclear speckles, in which they are concentrated to active sites of transcription in the nucleoplasm (1Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 3Wang H.-Y Lin W. Dyck J.A. Yeakley J.M. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Fu X.-D. J.

Because changes in the intranuclear SR protein concentration play a critical role in determining which of the competing splice sites are selected, phosphorylation can also indirectly control alternative splice site selection (16Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Cell. 1992; 68: 365-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 17Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B.

Finally, it has been proposed that the formation of complexes between SF2/ASF and SRPKs may modulate the subcellular distribution of SF2/ASF (21Koizumi J. Okamoto Y. Onogi H. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11125-11131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Yet, the lack both of authentic SR proteins in the yeast genome and of alternative mRNA splicing in yeast suggests that these kinases play roles in the regulation of cellular processes in addition to that of mRNA splicing. Indeed, genetic analyses have implicated Dsk1, which is the fission yeast homologue of SRPK1 in the regulation of chromosome segregation at the metaphase/anaphase transition (22Takeuchi M. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 247-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, one of the endogenous substrates of Sky1p, in S. cerevisiae, is the RNA binding protein Npl3p, which has been implicated in mRNA transport (23Siebel C.W. Feng L. Guthrie C. Fu X.-D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5440-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sky1p was found to regulate nuclear import of Npl3p by promoting the interaction between Npl3p and its nuclear import receptor Mtr10p (24Yun C.Y. Fu X.-D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In a recent report it was also demonstrated that Sky1p is a key regulator of polyamine transport in S. cerevisiae(25Erez O. Kahana C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sky1 disruption in yeast cells resulted in dramatically reduced uptake of spermine, spermidine, or putrescine. Data presented in the same report suggest that Sky1p is also involved in regulating ion homeostasis. Further support for the hypothesis that SRPKs have a broader regulatory role was obtained with the finding that the C. elegansfamily member spk-1 is predominantly expressed in germ cells and is required for germline development in C. elegans (26Kuroyanagi H. Kimura T. Kazuhiro W. Hisamoto N. Matsumoto K. Hagiwara M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 99: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In line with the above observations we have recently shown that SRPK1 is highly expressed in human and mouse testis and that the enzyme phosphorylates protamine 1 in an efficient and highly specific manner (27Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SRPK1 also has other additional substrates, besides the SR family of splicing factors, such as the Lamin BReceptor (LBR), an integral protein of the inner nuclear membrane, that contains a stretch of RS repeats at its nucleoplasmic NH2-terminal domain (28Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novelSRPK1 gene product, named SRPK1a, that contains an insertion of 171 amino acids at its NH2-terminal domain. The two SRPK isoforms are nearly identical in terms of substrate specificity and subcellular localization and in their ability to induce alternative splicing in transfected cells. Furthermore, they were similarly expressed in various human tissues, although the level of expression of SRPK1a was significantly lower than that of SRPK1. Yet, using the yeast two-hybrid assay we found that, unlike SRPK1, SRPK1a interacts, via its NH2-terminal domain, with SAF-B, a well characterized S/MAR binding protein. The so-called S/MARs (forScaffold/Matrix AttachmentRegions) are specialized DNA elements that mediate the attachment of chromatin to the nuclear scaffold and have been found in all eukaryotic organisms investigated (for review see Ref. 30Bode J. Benham C. Knopp A. Mielke C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 73-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The implications of this interaction are discussed below. A Lambda ZAP Express human testis cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using a 617-bp fragment, comprising part of the sequence of human SRPK1 (1Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) (nucleotides 262–879, starting from ATG; for details see Ref. 27Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). 5 × 105 plaques were screened by hybridization of Hybond filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard procedures (31Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and yielded ten positive clones. One of the clones corresponded to full-length SRPK1. Two of the clones were identical to SRPK but contained an insertion of 513 bp between AAA (encoding lysine, the fourth amino acid of SRPK1) and GTG (encoding valine, the fifth amino acid of SRPK1). The sequence of both strands was determined using specific oligonucleotide primers and by a series of nested deletions and unidirectional exonuclease III digestion according to the manufacturer's instructions (double-stranded Nested deletion kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The EMBL data bank accession number for SRPK1a is AJ318054. Human multiple tissue I and II Northern blot filters were purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA) and processed as previously described (27Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and a PCR fragment of 528 bp, comprising nucleotides 1–528 of the coding region of human SRPK1a, were used as probes for SRPK1 and SRPK1a, respectively. The 860-bp mouse fragment is 92% identical, at the DNA level, (98% at the protein level) to the respective human fragment. RT-PCR analysis was performed using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim D-68298, Germany) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from human testis, provided from CLONTECHlaboratories, was used as template. Two micrograms of testis RNA was initially denatured at 94 °C for 1 min and then incubated, for first-strand cDNA synthesis, with 10 pmol of antisense primer (5′-CTTCCTGCTCTGGTAGATCAC-3′) at 55 °C for 35 min. The following sense primer (10 pmol) was used for PCR amplification: 5′-GGTCTCACCATGGAGCGGAAA-3′. PCR conditions were: denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles: 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, extension at 68 °C for 40 s, and a final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. Amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. The pGEX-2T bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to express human SRPK1 (27Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 28Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To subclone the NH2-terminal domain of SRPK1a into pGEX-2T, two primers (sense: 5′-AGTAGGATCCATGGAGCGGAAAGGTGAGCGG-3′, containing a BamHI site; antisense: 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCACTGCAGGAGAGAGGGATGG-3′) were used to amplify a DNA fragment, comprising nucleotides 1–528 of the coding region of SRPK1a, by polymerase chain reaction. PCR was performed as described (29Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) but with the addition of 10% Me2SO. The PCR fragment was digested with BamHI, repurified, and cloned into the BamHI and SmaI sites of pGEX-2T. Wild-type and specifically altered forms of LBR protein were prepared as GST fusion proteins as previously described (29Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, wtNt: contains the NH2-terminal domain of LBR (amino acids 1–205); ΔRSNt: contains the NH2-terminal domain of LBR but lacks the RS motifs (amino acids 75–84; 75RSRSRSRSRS84); wtNtG78, wtNtA80, wtNtA82, and wtNtA84: fusion proteins identical to wtNt except that in each case Ser78, Ser80, Ser82, or Ser84 was mutated to Gly or Ala. Full-length SRPK1 and SRPK1a were also subcloned into the p-FLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak) vector and expressed in 293T cells with a FLAG tag fused at their NH2 termini. For this purpose oligonucleotides corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-complementary coding regions of humanSRPK1 and SRPK1a with additional EcoRI sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were prepared (SRPK1, sense: 5′-CGGGAATTCTATGGAGCGGAAAGTGCTTGCG-3′, antisense: 5′-CGAGAATTCCCGGAGTTAAGCCAAGGGTGCCG-3′; SRPK1a, sense: 5′-CGGGAATTCTATGGAGCGGAAAGGTGAGCGG-3′, antisense: 5′-CGAGAATTCCCGGAGTTAAGCCAAGGGTGCCG-3′), and PCR was performed. The products were digested with EcoRI, repurified, and cloned into the EcoRI site of p-FLAG-CMV-2 in the correct orientation. Rat SAF-B-PC encoding the COOH-terminal part of rat SAF-B (starting from nucleotide 1746 of the rat SAF-B sequence; EMBL data bank accession number AF056324) was expressed as a GST fusion protein or subcloned into the pEGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) and expressed in 293T cells with green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused at its NH2 terminus as previously described (32Nayler O. Stratling W. Bourquin J.P. Stagljar I. Lindemann L. Jasper H. Hartmann A.M. Fackelmayer F.O. Ullrich A. Stamm S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3542-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against SRPK1/SRPK1a and specifically against SRPK1a were produced by injecting GST-SRPK1 and GST-SRPK1aNt into rabbits as described previously (33Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was a kind gift of George Mosialos (Biomedical Sciences Research Center Al. Fleming, Vari, Attiki), whereas the anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A 528-bp fragment coding for the NH2-terminal domain of SRPK1a (SRPK1aNt; see above) was amplified by PCR (sense primer: 5′-CTGGAATTCATGGAGCGGAAAGGTGAGCGG-3′; antisense primer: 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCACTGCAGGAGAGAGGGATGG-3′), digested withBamHI, and cloned into the BamHI andSmaI sites of pGBT9 (CLONTECH) in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. S. cerevisiae strain pJ69-4A (MAT a trp1–901 leu2–3,112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80ΔLYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met2::GAL7-lacZ) (34James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transformed with pGBT9-SRPK1aNt and an equimolar mixture of E9.5 and E10.5 mouse embryonic cDNA libraries constructed in the pVP16 fusion vector (35Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Feng Cheng P. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected on SC (synthetic complete) minus Trp, Leu, His medium (36Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) containing 11.25 µm Ade and 3 mm AT (3-amino triazole). The positive pVP16-derived plasmids isolated in this screen were rescued and used to again co-transform yeast strain pJ69-4A with pGBT9-SRPK1aNt or pGBT9-SRPK1 to confirm and test the specificity of the interactions. The coding region of SRPK1 was amplified by PCR (sense primer: 5′-GTAGAATTCATGGAGCGGAAAGTGCTTGCG-3′; antisense primer: 5′-TAGGAATTCGGAGTTAAGCCAAGGGTGCCG-3′), digested withEcoRI, and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGBT9 in the correct orientation. Human 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 5 × 105 cells (∼50% confluent) were transfected with 5 µg of p-FLAG-CMV-2-SRPK1 or p-FLAG-CMV-2-SRPK1a DNA using the calcium phosphate method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 7: 2745-2752Crossref Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Total amounts of plasmid DNA were made up to 20 µg with pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). After 16 h the medium was changed and the cells were incubated for another 24 h. Cells were lysed with 200 µl of 1% Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmPMSF) for 30 min on ice. Whole cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). One hundred and fifty micrograms of each lysate was supplemented with the appropriate volume of 5× sample electrophoresis buffer and analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, an alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate. For immunoprecipitation 100 µg of each extract was incubated with 1 µl of the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody or with 5 µl of the anti-SRPK1 or the anti-SRPK1a polyclonal antibodies for 3 h on ice. Twenty microliters of protein G beads (for the monoclonal antibody) or protein A beads (for the polyclonal antibodies) was added and incubated overnight on ice. Antigen-antibody complexes were collected by centrifugation and were washed three times with lysis buffer. In vitro phosphorylation assays were performed on beads as described previously (29Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8365-8372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) using as substrates wild-type and specifically altered forms of LBR protein (see above) and recombinant ASF/SF2 (kindly provided by Jamal Tazi, Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier, UMR 5535, CNRS). The same procedure was followed for immunoprecipitation from rat testis cytosol. Cells co-transfected with plasmid DNA encoding GFP-SAF-B-PC and FLAG-SRPK1 or FLAG-SRPK1a were lysed in 200 µl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmPMSF). One hundred microliters of the supernatants, following centrifugation, was diluted 4-fold in radioimmune precipitation rescue buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 20 mmNaCl, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) and immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C, under shaking, using 3 µl of anti-GFP antibody and 20 µl of protein G-Sepharose. The beads were washed three times in a buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm PMSF) and resuspended in 30 µl of SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were subsequently analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. GST-SAF-B (∼3–4 µg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 50 µl of cell extract, derived from 293T cells transfected with plasmid DNA encoding either FLAG-SRPK1 or FLAG-SRPK1a, in phosphate-buffered saline buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm PMSF) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. Incubations were carried out for 60 min at room temperature. The beads were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 25 µl of SDS sample buffer. Bound SRPK1 and SRPK1a were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and detected by Western blotting using the M5 anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Tau construct SV9/10/11, containing exon 10 flanked by tau exons 9 and 11, was described earlier (39Gao Q.S. Memmott J. Lafyatis R. Stamm S. Screaton G. Andreadis A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vivo splicing was performed essentially as described (40Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Prot. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105HEK293 cells were transfected with 1 µg of the reporter gene together with increasing amounts (0, 0.5, and 1 µg) of plasmid DNA encoding FLAG-SRPK1 or FLAG-SRPK1a, using the calcium phosphate method. RNA was isolated 17–24 h following transfection, using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription and PCR were carried out as described previously (40Stoss O. Stoilov P. Hartmann A.M. Nayler O. Stamm S. Brain Res. Prot. 1999; 4: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In our previous reports we used a PCR approach to reclone theSRPK1 cDNA to examine its relationship with a previously identified LBR kinase (28Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Giannakouros T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Nikolakaki E. Simos G. Georgatos S.D. Giannakouros T. J. Biol.

Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this respect we screened a Lambda ZAP Express human testis cDNA library, at high stringency, using as a probe a 617-bp PCR fragment comprising nucleotides 262–879 of the sequence of human SRPK1 (for details see Ref. 27Papoutsopoulou S. Nikolakaki E. Chalepakis G. Kruft V. Chevaillier P. Giannakouros T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2972-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We isolated three full-length cDNA sequences corresponding toSRPK1. However, one of the clones contained an insertion of 513 bp between AAA (encoding lysine, the fourth amino acid of SRPK1) and GTG (encoding valine, the fifth amino acid of SRPK1), which is absent from the known sequence of SRPK1 (see Figs.1and 2). Because it is well documented that human SRPK1 is mapped to chromosome 6p21.2-p21.3 (41Wang H.-Y. Arden K.C. Bermingham J.R. Viars C.S. Lin W. Boyer A.D. Fu X.-D. Genomics. 1999; 57: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the genomic sequence is available (EMBL data bank, locus HS422H11, accession number Z99128) we compared the sequence of the isolated clone with the genomic sequence. The sequence alignment revealed that the SRPK1 gene comprises 16 exons (Fig. 2 A, see also EMBL data bank, locus HS422H11, accession number Z99128, gene = dJ422H11.1). The 513-bp insert is located between the first two exons of SRPK1. This suggests that this segment may be alternatively spliced. The SRPK1cDNA originally isolated by Gui et al. (1Gui J.-F. Lane W.S. Fu X.-D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) would encode the isoform lacking the 171 amino acids encoded by the 513-bp segment, whereas the novel cDNA, designated SRPK1a (EMBL data bank, accession number AJ318054), would encode the isoform containing this sequence (Fig. 2, A–C). Further analysis revealed the presence of 5′- and 3′-splice sites at the ends of the intervening regions, suggesting that the 513-bp segment normally represents an intronic sequence that is not, however, spliced out from theSRPK1a transcript (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2Schematic representation of the alternative splicing of the 513-bp fragment.

Exon 1 within theSRPK1a transcript comprises exons 1a and 1b of SRPK1 as well as the 513-bp segment (nucleotides 94650–94137), which is excluded from SRPK1. B, comparison of the amino acid sequence encoded by exon 1 of SRPK1a with the respective sequences encoded by exons 1a and 1b of SRPK1. The sequence encoded by the 513-bp segment, which is absent in SRPK1, is denoted by the dashed line. C, the nucleotide sequence surrounding the alternatively spliced 513-bp segment. Splicing out of the 513-bp segment would result in production of SRPK1 (containing the amino acid sequences encoded by exons 1a and 1b).

In plastocyanins, the Cu(II)/Cu(I) ion resides in the so-called type I copper center, characterized by the presence of one cysteine and two histidine residues strongly bound to copper in a trigonal plane (5Adman E.T.

The electron transfer mediated by plastocyanin exhibits distinctive features in different organisms (2Navarro J.A. Hervàs M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg.

Depending on the organism and the copper levels in the growth medium, cytochrome c 6 can replace plastocyanin in some cyanobacteria and most eukaryotic algae (9Sandman G. Arch.

Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994Crossref Google Scholar). Molecular recognition between plastocyanins and their redox partners has been thoroughly studied in plants, even if some aspects are still obscure. Two conserved surface regions have been identified on plastocyanin: the so-called “eastern” and “northern” protein patches (2Navarro J.A. Hervàs M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg.

The eastern patch is a negatively charged region, conserved in plant plastocyanins, whereas a hydrophobic surface around the redox metal center constitutes the so-called northern pole (2Navarro J.A.

The charged region participates in electrostatic interactions with the electron transfer partners, whereas the hydrophobic patch is involved in electron transfer through the copper-bound His86. In plastocyanins from cyanobacteria, the negatively charged patch is significantly smaller than in proteins from higher plants (2Navarro J.A. Hervàs M. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Inorg.

PCC6803, which was used to assess the level of refinement attainable for an NMR solution structure of a copper(II)-containing protein. The present study reports on the backbone mobility of both redox forms of plastocyanin, spanning a wide range of time scales, as well as an investigation of the H2O/D2O exchange in different time frames. Mobility studies are so far available for two blue copper proteins, azurin (30Kalverda A.P. Ubbink M. Gilardi G. Wijmenga S.S. Crawford A. Jeuken L.J.C. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12690-12697Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and pseudoazurin (31Thompson G.S. Leung Y.-C. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Redfield C. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 846-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), in the reduced form. The mobility of cupredoxins in their oxidized form has never been studied by NMR due to the difficulties related to the presence of the strongly paramagnetic Cu(II) ion. The structure of the reduced plastocyanin is also reported, together with a thorough comparison with the solution structure of the oxidized form. The petE gene encoding plastocyanin was amplified from total genomic DNA isolated from the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis sp. PCC6803 by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-CCCCGCTGCCATGGCCAATGCAACA-3′; 5′-CGACACACAGATCTAGCTGGCTGAT-3′. These primers introduced a methionine start codon (bold type) as well as an NcoI site (underlined) at the 5′-end of the coding sequence of mature plastocyanin and a BglII site (underlined) downstream from the stop codon of the gene. A polymerase chain reaction product with the expected size and containing the expected HindIII site was amplified. The product was digested with NcoI and BglII and cloned into plasmid pET3d that had been digested with NcoI andBamHI to produce plasmid pET3d::6803petE. It should be noted that this construction is expected to cause the production of a protein whose N-terminal sequence after processing of the N-terminal methionine residue is ANATVKMGSD. . . . . This N-terminal sequence corresponds to that of the wild-type protein (32Hervas M. Navarro F. Navarro J.A. Chavez S. Diaz A. Florencio F.J. De la Rosa M.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequence analysis of plasmid pET3d::6803petE revealed that the expressed protein would contain a single amino acid difference from the published wild-type sequence. The GAG codon encoding the carboxyl-terminal glutamic acid was found to be GAC encoding aspartic acid. It is not known whether this change resulted from a mutation introduced by the Taq polymerase used in the polymerase chain reaction amplification or whether this change had occurred in the laboratory Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 strain used to produce the genomic DNA. The resultant expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS for overproduction of the PetE protein as subsequently described. The expression ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 plastocyanin in E. coli was based on the T7 expression system described by Studieret al. (33Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 66-89Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed by plasmid pET3d::6803 petE were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Luria broth (10 g of bactotryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl per liter) supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg ml−1) and chloramphenicol (34 μg ml−1) in shaking flasks at 37 °C until theA 600 = 0.6–1.0 (∼3 h).15N-Enriched plastocyanin was obtained from cells grown as described above, but in mineral medium containing 6 g of Na2HPO4, 3 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of NaCl, 1.25 g of [15N](NH4)2SO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 20 g glucose, 50 mg of ampicillin, and 34 mg chloramphenicol per liter. The cells were collected and resuspended in the same volume of freshly prepared medium. Isopropyl- β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and CuSO4 were added to a final concentration of 0.4 and 0.1 mm, respectively, for induction of plastocyanin expression. The cells were harvested by centrifugation after 3–4 h of additional growth and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8 (1/10 culture volume). The cell suspension was subjected to 3 cycles of freezing at −80 °C and thawing. Membrane fragments and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 40 min, and the clear extract was incubated with DNase I (Fluka) from bovine pancreas (20 mg l−1) and MgCl2 (10 mm) for 30 min at room temperature in order to digest chromosomal DNA. The obtained extract was used for subsequent purification. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to the extract to a final concentration of 2 m, and the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × gfor 30 min. The clear supernatant was loaded on a phenyl-Sepharose hydrophobic interaction column (2.6 × 20 cm), and a gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (from 2 to 0m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, was used to fractionate the extracted proteins. Two plastocyanin peaks (oxidized and reduced forms) were separately eluted. These fractions were pooled, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, using a membrane with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa and concentrated to 2 ml using an Amicon ultrafiltration unit equipped with a YM3 membrane. The concentrated protein fraction was loaded onto a Superdex 75 size-exclusion column (2.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, containing 200 mmNaCl. The eluted plastocyanin fractions were pooled and concentrated, and (NH4)2SO4 was added to the final concentration of 2 m. The final purification step was performed with a hydrophobic interaction, alkyl-Sepharose HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using a gradient of (NH4)2SO4 (from 2 to 1m) in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.3, to elute the plastocyanin. The pooled plastocyanin fractions (20–25 mg of purified protein from 1 liter of cell culture) were homogenous as judged by SDS-PAGE carried out using a 16% acrylamide separating gel and a Bio-Rad Miniprotean apparatus (Richmond, CA). The absorbance ratio (A 278/A 600) of the oxidized plastocyanin in the final preparation was 2.0, as reported earlier for native Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 plastocyanin (32Hervas M. Navarro F. Navarro J.A. Chavez S. Diaz A. Florencio F.J. De la Rosa M.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of crude preparations was determined using the extinction coefficient of 4.5 × 10−3m−1 cm−1 at 600 nm (32Hervas M. Navarro F. Navarro J.A. Chavez S. Diaz A. Florencio F.J. De la Rosa M.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 319: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34Kato S. Shiratori I. Takamiya A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1962; 51: 32-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration in the final fraction was determined by the method of Bradford (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples for NMR spectroscopy (2–3 mm) were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (either in 90% H2O, 10% D2O or in 100% D2O) at pH 5.2–6.5. Complete reduction of the protein was obtained by addition of a slight excess of a freshly prepared sodium ascorbate solution, and the sample was kept under argon during the NMR experiments. The oxidation was achieved using a slight excess of ferricyanide, subsequently removed by gel filtration. A catalytic amount of laccase was then added to the oxidized protein sample, which was kept under oxygen throughout the NMR experiments. Bruker Avance spectrometers operating at 800, 700, 600, and 500 MHz proton Larmor frequencies were used to collect NMR spectra. Data acquisition and processing were performed using a standard Bruker software package (XWINNMR). The acquisition of homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectra, as well as data processing, were performed using the same strategy as described previously (29Bertini I. Ciurli S. Dikiy A. Fernandez C. Luchinat C. Safarov N. Shumilin S. Vila A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The time settings in the pulse sequences were largely coincident with those used to detect diamagnetic connectivities in the case of the oxidized form of the protein (29Bertini I. Ciurli S. Dikiy A. Fernandez C. Luchinat C. Safarov N. Shumilin S. Vila A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The program XEASY (36Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) was employed for spectral analysis and for cross-peaks integration. The sequence-specific resonance assignment was carried out using standard procedures (37Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar, 38Arseniev A. Schultze P. Worgotter E. Braun W. Wagner G. Vasak M. Kagi J.H. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 637-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The volumes of NOESY1cross-peaks, together with the values of3 J Hα-NH coupling constants from three-dimensional HNHA experiments (39Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), and in combination with some hydrogen bonds constraints, were utilized for structure calculation of the reduced protein, using the DYANA package (40Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Additional φ and ψ dihedral angles constraints were obtained from the relative intensities of the intra- and inter-residue Hα-NH NOESY cross-peaks as measured in NOESY-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence and NOESY spectra (41Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Lee M.X. Chandra M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1961-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The constraints for the copper atom were treated as described previously (29Bertini I. Ciurli S. Dikiy A. Fernandez C. Luchinat C. Safarov N. Shumilin S. Vila A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structure calculation followed closely the procedure described for the oxidized protein (29Bertini I. Ciurli S. Dikiy A. Fernandez C. Luchinat C. Safarov N. Shumilin S. Vila A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2405-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The 35 structures with the lowest target function obtained from DYANA calculations (42Guntert P. Braun W. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) were selected as a single family for further analysis. The mean structure from the DYANA family was calculated using MOLMOL (43Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar) and subjected to restrained energy minimization using the SANDER module of the AMBER 5.0 program package (44Pearlman D.A. Case D.A. Caldwell J.W. Ross W.S. Cheatham T.E. Ferguson D.M. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. Amber 5.0. University of California, San Francisco1997Google Scholar). The quality of the structures was determined using PROCHECK (45Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The coordinates of the structure family and the minimized DYANA mean structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The protein mobility in this time range was studied in both reduced and oxidized plastocyanin at 295 K and pH 6.50. 15N nuclear spin relaxation experiments were recorded at 600.13 (1H) and 60.81 MHz (15N) on a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer. All spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 6614 Hz over 2048 real data points in ω2, and the carrier frequency was set at the H2O signal frequency. The time proportional phase incrementation method was used for frequency discrimination in ω1 (46Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). The spectral width in ω1 was 2068 Hz, sampled over 256 real t 1points, and 8 transients (32 for heteronuclear NOE experiments) were acquired per each t 1 point. The recycle delay was 1.7 s (3.0 s for heteronuclear NOE). Suppression of the intense water resonance was accomplished by the use of a water-selective inversion pulse train (WATERGATE) (47Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) together with a flip-back pulse (48Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). All spectra were transformed with 1 × 1024 points in the F2 and F1 dimensions, respectively. Only the downfield part of the 1H spectra containing the H-N connectivities (5–12 ppm) was kept for the data analysis. The cross-peaks were integrated using the standard routine of the XWINNMR program. 15N longitudinal relaxation rate (R 1) values were measured as described previously (49Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The recovery delays used in the pulse sequence were 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 150, 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2250 ms.15N R 2 rates were measured using the CPMG pulse sequence with a refocusing delay of 450 μs (49Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 50Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar). Fifteen experiments with recovery delays of 7, 14, 22, 29, 43, 57, 72, 86, 100, 129, 158, 172, 215, 244, and 287 ms were collected. Heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE experiments were measured using a described pulse sequence (48Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Two spectra were collected, one with proton saturation and one without. Saturation of the proton spectrum was achieved by applying non-selective pulses during the recycle delay. The heteronuclear NOE values were obtained as the ratio of the intensity measured with and without saturation of the amide protons. The uncertainties in the NOE values, expressed as 3ς, were estimated by collecting two independent data sets. Relaxation rates R 1 and R 2 were determined by fitting the cross-peak intensities (I), measured as a function of the variable delay (t) within the pulse sequence to a single exponential decay by using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (51Marquardt D.W. J. Soc. Ind. Appl. Math. 1963; 11: 431-441Crossref Google Scholar, 52Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, New York1988Google Scholar) according to the following equation: I(t) = A +B·exp(−Rt). A, B, andR were adjustable fitting parameters. ForR 2, A was set equal to 0 in the fitting procedure. Uncertainties in the R 1 andR 2 values were determined by using a Monte Carlo approach (53Zinn-Justin S. Berthault P. Guenneugues M. Desvaux H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 54Palmer A.G.I. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem.

Hydrodynamic calculations were performed using the program Quadric Diffusion 1.11 (56Lee L.K. Rance M. Chazin W.J. Palmer A.G.I. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) applied to the energy-minimized mean solution structures of Cu(I) and Cu(II) plastocyanin. The diffusion parameters for isotropic, axially symmetric, and fully anisotropic models were fit to the experimental data via minimization techniques (56Lee L.K. Rance M. Chazin W.J. Palmer A.G.I. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). TheF statistic term (57Mandel M.A. Akke M. Palmer A.G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) was used to test the improvement in the statistical fit. Residues exhibiting faster internal motions or exchange broadening contributions were not included in the input file for evaluating the diffusion tensor. The analysis of the 15N relaxation rate parameters and heteronuclear NOE values was performed according to model-free formalisms by using Modelfree 4.0 program (57Mandel M.A. Akke M. Palmer A.G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) within the Lipari-Szabo approach (58Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3409) Google Scholar, 59Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). The S 2 values were calculated using a fixed N-H bond length of 1.02 Å and 15N chemical shift anisotropy Δς = −172 ppm (60Ishima R. Torchia D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In the case of the Cu(II)-oxidized plastocyanin, the paramagnetic contribution to the experimental R 1, R 2, and NOE values was evaluated through the point-dipole approximation according to the Solomon-Bloembergen equations (61Solomon I. Phys. Rev. 1955; 99: 559-565Crossref Scopus (2803) Google Scholar) and subtracted from the measured relaxation rates as described previously (62Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Koulougliotis D. Monti A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7117-7130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 63Bertini I. Luchinat C. Niikura Y. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2000; 41: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The longitudinal electronic relaxation rate at 14.1 tesla used in these calculations was 4 × 109 s−1, as interpolated from estimates at 11.7 and 17.6 (64Ma L. Led J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7823-7824Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) as well as 18.8 tesla (65Bertini I. Fernandez C.O. Karlsson B.G. Leckner J. Luchinat C. Malmstrom B.G. Nersissian A.M. Pierattelli R. Shipp E. Valentine J.S. Vila A.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3701-3707Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) reported for blue copper proteins. The protein mobility in this time range was studied in the reduced form of the protein, at 295 K and pH 6.50. The 15N nuclear spin relaxation experiments were recorded at 800.13 (1H) and 81.08 MHz (15N) on a Bruker Avance 800 NMR spectrometer. 15N R 2 relaxation rates were measured as a function of the spin-echo delay in a series ofT 2 CPMG experiments (49Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 50Kay L.E. Nicholson L.K. Delaglio F. Bax A. Torchia D.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 97: 359-375Google Scholar) using different refocusing delays (τCPMG = 450, 550, 700, 850, 1000, and 1150 μs). The relaxation delay during the sequence varied from 7 to 300 ms, the exact value depending on τCPMG. The water signal was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (47Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The protein mobility in this time range was indirectly studied both in reduced and oxidized forms of the protein, at 295 K and pH 6.50, through proton exchange measurements. The spectra were recorded at 800.13 (1H) and 81.08 MHz (15N) on a Bruker Avance 800 NMR spectrometer. Saturation transfer processes between protein amide protons and bulk water were followed by comparing the intensities of1H-15N cross-peaks in two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra obtained by suppressing the water signal either (i) using the WATERGATE (47Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) pulse sequence supplemented with a flip-back pulse (48Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) or (ii) using a pre-saturation pulse (900 ms) during both relaxation delay and refocusing time. The protein mobility in this time range was studied both in both reduced and oxidized plastocyanin at 295 K and pH 6.50. Two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC spectra were recorded at 800.13 (1H) and 81.08 MHz (15N) on a Bruker Avance 800 NMR spectrometer at different times, between 8 min and 2 days, after the addition of deuterated phosphate buffer (450 μl) to a protein solution (50 μl) in buffered H2O. Water suppression was performed using the WATERGATE (47Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) pulse sequence. The intensity of the cross-peaks was fitted using a single mono-exponential decay function, yielding the rate constant for the exchange process between protein amide protons and bulk water. The 1H and 15N NMR signals of all residues were completely or partially assigned through comparative analysis of homonuclear and heteronuclear two- and three-dimensional NMR spectra. All backbone 1H and15N NMR signals were assigned, except for Ala1, for which this was not possible because of fast exchange with the solvent. The assignment largely confirmed and further extended that reported previously(66). The full 1H and 15N assignment achieved in this study, together with the stereo-specific assignment, is reported in Table S1 of the Supplementary Material.

In a previous communication we demonstrated that tubulin possesses chaperone-like activities by preventing the stress-induced aggregation of various proteins (Guha, S., Manna, T. K., Das, K. P., and Bhattacharyya, B. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 30077–30080). As an extension of this observation, we explored whether tubulin, like other known chaperones, also protected biological activity of proteins against thermal stress or increased the yields of active proteins during refolding from a denatured state. We show here that tubulin not only prevents the thermal aggregation of alcohol dehydrogenase and malic dehydrogenase but also protects them from loss of activity. We also show that tubulin prevents the aggregation of substrates during their refolding from a denatured state and forms a stable complex with denatured substrate. The activity of malic dehydrogenase, α-glucosidase, and lactate dehydrogenase during their refolding from urea or guanidium hydrochloride denatured states increased significantly in presence of tubulin compared with that without tubulin. These results suggest that tubulin, in addition to its role in mitosis, cell motility, and other cellular events, might be implicated in protein folding and protection from stress.

Thus, they are classes of polypeptide-binding proteins that are implicated in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation, subcellular transport and degradation (2Hartl F.U.

The major classes of chaperones comprise GroEL, DnaK, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70),1 HSP90, and the small HSPs. The key parameters measured in vitro that characterize a protein as a molecular chaperone include: (i) the ability to protect from aggregation during protein unfolding under stress conditions; (ii) the ability to suppress aggregation during protein refolding from a denatured state; and (iii) recovery of lost biological activity. Early work from this laboratory demonstrated that tubulin could efficiently suppress the thermal and chemically induced aggregation of several proteins in the unfolding pathway (6Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that tubulin, in a manner similar to that of some well known molecular chaperones (7Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Ruddon R.W.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), suppresses the aggregation of unfolded substrate proteins during refolding pathways, protects the enzymes from loss of activity during thermal stress, and increases the yield of biological activity of enzymes refolding from a fully denatured state. In the present study, model substrates taken for the refolding and reactivation studies are cytoplasmic malic dehydrogenase (MDH), lactate dehydrogenase, α-glucosidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Tubulin binds to the unstable conformers of these proteins during both unfolding and refolding, preventing their nonspecific aggregation. Activity yields of these refolding substrates are enhanced significantly in the presence of tubulin compared with those in its absence. Therefore, we propose that, in addition to their role in cell division, cell motility, and other cellular events, tubulin might assist in protein folding and renaturation in the cytoplasm.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that tubulin not only prevents thermal or chemical stress-induced aggregation of proteins on their unfolding pathway but also inhibits protein aggregation caused by misfolding during refolding from a fully unfolded state. It binds to the unstable intermediates of the substrate proteins in their unfolding or refolding pathway and eventually through a relatively slow process guides the substrates to its correct folded state. The lost enzymatic activity is thus regained to a considerable extent compared with that without the tubulin. This behavior is very similar to some of the well-studied molecular chaperones.Our results also show that the mechanism of this chaperone action is through preferential binding of the non-native or denatured states of substrate proteins (Figs. 3 and 4). This binding step is a key step and is common to all the known molecular chaperones (4Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Tubulin is known to have distinct domains to interact with both hydrophilic and lipophilic moieties of other molecules (28Ward L.D. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11891-11899Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29Pontingel H. Krauhs E. Little M. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1983; 15: 359-362Google Scholar). Interaction of the exposed hydrophobic regions of unfolding or refolding substrates with those of tubulin reduces the chance of nonspecific hydrophobic association between substrate molecules. Self-aggregation of refolding substrates appears to be faster than the kinetics of tubulin-ssisted refolding (Figs. 2 and 5). It must be remembered that aggregation measured by the 90° scattering technique used here detects relatively large particles (30Bhattacharyya J. Das K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15505-15509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), which level off before 5 min (Fig. 2). Aggregation at the level of dimer or trimer starts almost instantly. Addition of tubulin just seconds after the initiation of refolding reactions leads to nearly complete loss of chaperone activity (Fig.2 D), indicating that tubulin acts only on the unaggregated substrates.Although the general behavior of tubulin as a chaperone is similar to that of the well known chaperone GroEL in many ways, there are some notable differences. The activity yield of refolding substrates assisted by GroEL was in most cases ATP-dependent (21Jacob U. Gaestel M. Engel K. Buchner J. J. Biol.

In the present case, the in vitro activity yield was independent of GTP or ATP. It should be mentioned here that similar ATP-independent promotion of substrate protein folding has been reported earlier (32Jacob U. Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar,33Buchner J. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) for other chaperones such as HSP90 and small HSPs. The role of ATP in the GroEL-assisted refolding is to dissociate the chaperone-substrate complex (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 3Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and the final refolded form is achieved by many cycles of binding and release of the substrate with the help of co-chaperone GroES and ATP (1Gething M.J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U.

In the present case, we apparently failed to identify any dissociation of the complex by several means. Gel filtration data (Fig. 3) showed the presence of a bound stable complex. Repeated chromatography of the bound species (tubulin-substrate complex) on the same column showed no dissociation peak of the substrate, even in the presence of GTP and ATP (data not shown). Also, repeated concentration and dilution of the tubulin-MDH complex through a 100-kDa Microcon system showed no presence of free MDH (FITC-labeled) in the filtrate (Fig. 4). Thus our in vitro study reveals that the action of tubulin occurs through a substrate binding mechanism with apparently no active mechanism for its release. Nucleolar protein B23 has recently been reported to act as a molecular chaperone through a similar mechanism (34Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, as mentioned by us earlier (4Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), it should be pointed out that in vivo other chaperones, co-chaperones, and molecules may be involved in tandem in such a folding mechanism. Such a concerted mechanism has been accepted for GroEL chaperone function (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 3Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It should also be mentioned that such behavior as observed here is also consistent with the “marsupium” (kangaroo's bag) model (35Yoshida M. Ishii N. Muneyuki E. Taguchi H. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), according to which the folding of the bound substrates continues within the complex without dissociation from the chaperone until folding is nearly complete. Early observations by others also support this model (27Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwicz A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 36Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We think that our findings have considerable physiological significance. Only a few specific molecular chaperones have been identified on eukaryotic cytosol. Some of them are known to mediate in the folding process of a very limited subset of proteins. For example, TRic is known to help fold tubulin and actin only but not other proteins (37Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 38Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 39Sternlicht H. Farr G.W. Sternlicht M.L. Driscoll J.K. Yaffe M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although TRic is present in all eukaryotic cytosol, its abundance is quite low (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). It still remains an open question of how the majority of the proteins in the cytosol fold. The relatively large natural abundance of tubulin (∼15%) in eukaryotic cytoskeleton and its ability to mediate in folding of various proteins throw new light on understanding this aspect. It is possible that other chaperones, not known yet, may also be involved in the folding sequence, but our results prove beyond doubt that tubulin plays considerable role in protein folding apart from its known role in mitosis and cell motility. Molecular chaperones consist of several groups of proteins that suppress the aggregation of unstable intermediates of proteins and through well-coordinated interactions with the folding and transport machinery of the cell guide them to their correct fate in vivo (1Gething M.J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1997Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 3Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Thus, they are classes of polypeptide-binding proteins that are implicated in protein folding, protein targeting to membranes, protein renaturation, subcellular transport and degradation (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar, 3Frydman J. Hohfeld J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem.

The major classes of chaperones comprise GroEL, DnaK, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70),1 HSP90, and the small HSPs. The key parameters measured in vitro that characterize a protein as a molecular chaperone include: (i) the ability to protect from aggregation during protein unfolding under stress conditions; (ii) the ability to suppress aggregation during protein refolding from a denatured state; and (iii) recovery of lost biological activity. Early work from this laboratory demonstrated that tubulin could efficiently suppress the thermal and chemically induced aggregation of several proteins in the unfolding pathway (6Guha S. Manna T.K. Das K.P. Bhattacharyya B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30077-30080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that tubulin, in a manner similar to that of some well known molecular chaperones (7Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 8Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9Ruddon R.W.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), suppresses the aggregation of unfolded substrate proteins during refolding pathways, protects the enzymes from loss of activity during thermal stress, and increases the yield of biological activity of enzymes refolding from a fully denatured state. In the present study, model substrates taken for the refolding and reactivation studies are cytoplasmic malic dehydrogenase (MDH), lactate dehydrogenase, α-glucosidase, and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Tubulin binds to the unstable conformers of these proteins during both unfolding and refolding, preventing their nonspecific aggregation. Activity yields of these refolding substrates are enhanced significantly in the presence of tubulin compared with those in its absence. Therefore, we propose that, in addition to their role in cell division, cell motility, and other cellular events, tubulin might assist in protein folding and renaturation in the cytoplasm. DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that tubulin not only prevents thermal or chemical stress-induced aggregation of proteins on their unfolding pathway but also inhibits protein aggregation caused by misfolding during refolding from a fully unfolded state. It binds to the unstable intermediates of the substrate proteins in their unfolding or refolding pathway and eventually through a relatively slow process guides the substrates to its correct folded state. The lost enzymatic activity is thus regained to a considerable extent compared with that without the tubulin. This behavior is very similar to some of the well-studied molecular chaperones.Our results also show that the mechanism of this chaperone action is through preferential binding of the non-native or denatured states of substrate proteins (Figs. 3 and 4).

Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 36Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol.

Only a few specific molecular chaperones have been identified on eukaryotic cytosol. Some of them are known to mediate in the folding process of a very limited subset of proteins. For example, TRic is known to help fold tubulin and actin only but not other proteins (37Gao Y. Thomas J.O. Chow R.L. Lee G.H. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 38Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Although TRic is present in all eukaryotic cytosol, its abundance is quite low (2Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). It still remains an open question of how the majority of the proteins in the cytosol fold. The relatively large natural abundance of tubulin (∼15%) in eukaryotic cytoskeleton and its ability to mediate in folding of various proteins throw new light on understanding this aspect. It is possible that other chaperones, not known yet, may also be involved in the folding sequence, but our results prove beyond doubt that tubulin plays considerable role in protein folding apart from its known role in mitosis and cell motility.

Differences in the regioselectivity of oxidation products formed in systems containing NADPH-P450 reductase/NADPH and the model oxidant cumene hydroperoxide have been proposed by others to be due to an allosteric influence of the reductase on P450 2D6 (Modi, S., Gilham, D. E., Sutcliffe, M. J., Lian, L.-Y., Primrose, W. U., Wolf, C. R., and Roberts, G. C. K. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 4461–4470). We examined the differences in the formation of oxidation products ofN-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine, metoprolol, and bufuralol between reductase-, cumene hydroperoxide-, and iodosylbenzene-supported systems. Catalytic regioselectivity was not influenced by the presence of the reductase in any of the systems supported by model oxidants, ruling out allosteric influences. The presence of the reductase had little effect on the affinity of P450 2D6 for any of these three substrates. The addition of the reaction remnants of the model oxidants (cumyl alcohol and iodobenzene) to the reductase-supported system did not affect reaction patterns, arguing against steric influences of these products on catalytic regioselectivity. Label from H218O was quantitatively incorporated into 1′-hydroxybufuralol in the iodosylbenzene- but not in the reductase- or cumene hydroperoxide-supported reactions. We conclude that the P450 systems utilizing NADPH-P450 reductase, cumene hydroperoxide, and iodosylbenzene use similar but distinct chemical mechanisms. These differences are the basis for the variable product distributions, not an allosteric influence of the reductase.

The P450 enzymes are found in nearly all life forms, but there has been particular interest in the mammalian P450 enzymes that dominate the metabolism of drugs (5Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). P450s constitute an important target in pharmacogenomic efforts because variation among individual humans can have a major influence on the efficacy of drugs (6Evans W.E. Relling M.V. Science. 1999; 286: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar). P450 2D6 was first identified as the polymorphic enzyme involved in debrisoquine hydroxylation (7Mahgoub A. Idle J.R. Dring L.G. Lancaster R. Smith R.L. Lancet. 1977; ii: 584-586Abstract Scopus (1015) Google Scholar) and sparteine oxidation (8Eichelbaum M. Spannbrucker N. Dengler H.J. Eur. J. Clin.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 473-535Crossref Google Scholar). P450 2D6 polymorphism is relatively well understood today (9Daly A.K. Brockmöller J. Broly F. Eichelbaum M. Evans W.E. Gonzalez F.J. Huang J.D. Idle J.R. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ishizaki T.

In our early research with purified P450 2D6 (12Distlerath L.M. Reilly P.E.B. Martin M.V. Davis G.G. Wilkinson G.R. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9057-9067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the observation was made that most of the substrates of P450 2D6 contain a basic nitrogen atom, which is located ∼5 Å away from the site of oxidation (13Wolff T. Distlerath L.M. Worthington M.T. Groopman J.D. Hammons G.J. Kadlubar F.F. Prough R.A. Martin M.V. Guengerich F.P. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2116-2122PubMed Google Scholar, 14Strobl G.R. von Kruedener S.

This concept was developed with more detailed pharmacophore and homology models for P450 2D6 (15Meyer U.A. Gut J. Kronbach T. Skoda C. Meier U.T. Catin T.

Dispos. 2001; 29: 936-944PubMed Google Scholar). A problem in modeling of P450 2D6 arose with the report of Modiet al. (19Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.-Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) that differences were observed between MPTP oxidations catalyzed by P450 2D6 supported with the usual NADPH/NADPH-P450 reductase/O2 system and with the model oxidant (“oxygen surrogate”) CuOOH. The authors interpreted the differences in product distribution as evidence for an allosteric role of NADPH-P450 reductase in orienting the substrate, and some evidence for this view was obtained with NMR relaxation studies of MPTP bound to ferric P450 2D6 (19Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.-Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We investigated the issue of possible allosterism imposed by NADPH-P450 reductase, in the context of our general interest in the cooperativity of other P450s, particularly P450s 3A4 (20Ueng Y.-F. Kuwabara T. Chun Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 21Hosea N.A. Miller G.P. Guengerich F.P.

We find that some product profiles differ for P450 2D6 oxidations of the substrates MPTP, metoprolol, and bufuralol supported by NADPH-P450 reductase and the oxygen surrogates CuOOH and PhIO, as in the case of some other P450s (23Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome. Plenum Press, New York1986: 217-271Google Scholar, 24Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry.

Chem. 1983; 258: 9153-9158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These differences were found not to be due to any effect of NADPH-P450 reductase or to steric interaction of the P450 2D6 substrates with reaction remnants of the oxygen surrogates, but they are attributable to inherent chemical differences in the systems as revealed with H218O studies in the case of PhIO. Another conclusion regarding the pharmacophore models is that they have limited ability to predict sites of oxidation for a typical drug substrate, bufuralol, where oxidation by P450 2D6 was shown to generate multiple products. MPTP is a potent neurotoxin and should be handled with gloves and use of other appropriate precautions. CuOOH can be explosive (86Mateles R.J. Chem. Eng. News. 1993; 71: 5Google Scholar). Bufuralol·HCl and 1′-hydroxybufuralol were generous gifts of Hoffman-LaRoche (Nutley, NJ). Metoprolol·HCl,Escherichia coli superoxide dismutase, andl-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were obtained from Sigma. Quinidine·HSO4, PTP, and iodosylbenzene diacetate were purchased from Aldrich. Metoprolol oxidation products (O-demethylmetoprolol and α-hydroxymetoprolol) were gifts from Astra Hässle AB (Mölndal, Sweden). MPTP was a gift of N. Catagnoli, Jr. (Virginia Polytechnic University, Blacksburg, VA). Bovine liver catalase (Sigma) was dialyzed prior to use to remove the preservative thymol. CuOOH was obtained from Aldrich and purified by extraction with alkali as described (28Hoch H. Lang S. Chem. Ber. 1944; 77: 257-264Crossref Google Scholar) prior to use. PhIO was prepared by the alkaline hydrolysis of the diacetate (29Saltzman H. Sharefkin J.G. Org. Syntheses Coll. 1973; 5: 658-659Google Scholar) and stored at −20 °C. MPTP-OH was synthesized by the condensation of phenol with 1-methyl-4-piperidone in CH3CO2H/HCl solution as described (30McElvain S.M. Berger R.S. J. Am. Chem.

The change of M374V was made, and the resulting sequence is that generally agreed to be the most common allele (9Daly A.K. Brockmöller J. Broly F. Eichelbaum M. Evans W.E. Gonzalez F.J. Huang J.D.

The modified protein was expressed in E. coli (MV1304 strain) in the presence of 1.0 mg of chloramphenicol liter−1 (35Kusano K. Waterman M.R. Sakaguchi M. Omura T. Kagawa N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Expressed P450 2D6 was purified by Ni2+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described (32Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S.

Wilson T.E. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7584-7589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified as described elsewhere (36Hanna I.H. Reed J.R. Guengerich F.P. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 376: 206-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 38Hanna I.H. Teiber J.F. Kokones K.L. Hollenberg P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Standard oxidation reactions with bufuralol, MPTP, and metoprolol were conducted in 0.5-ml final volumes of 0.10 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing P450 2D6 (0.25 nmol), NADPH-P450 reductase (0.5 nmol), and freshly sonicatedl-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (30 µg). In previous work with this recombinant P450 2D6 enzyme, these concentrations of the reductase and phospholipid were found to be optimal for bufuralol 1′-hydroxylation activity (32Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Final substrate concentrations were 0.10, 1.0, and 0.20 mm for bufuralol, MPTP, and metoprolol, respectively. The mixtures were incubated for 3 min at 37 °C and the reactions were started by the addition of an NADPH-generating system (1.0 mm NADP+, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1 unit of yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ml−1) (39Guengerich F.P. Hayes A.W. Principles and Methods of Toxicology. Taylor & Francis, New York2001: 1625-1687Google Scholar). In order to prevent heme destruction due to the generation of reactive oxygen species during catalysis, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with catalase and E. coli superoxide dismutase (1000 units and 20 µg, respectively) (40Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3633-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Incubations were carried out for 10 min at 37 °C and were quenched by the addition of 50 µl of 60% HClO4. Bufuralol and metoprolol reaction mixtures were centrifuged (3000 × g, 10 min) to sediment the precipitated proteins and salts, and aliquots of the recovered supernatants were directly injected onto an HPLC system for analysis. Incubations were carried out essentially as described above except for the exclusion of the NADPH-generating system, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. NADPH-P450 reductase was included in some oxidation reactions to determine if it had any allosteric effects on P450 2D6 during catalysis. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5–10 min and were initiated by the addition of methanolic solutions of CuOOH or PhIO (final concentrations of 0.5 and 0.3 mm, respectively, and 1% CH3OH, v/v). (In contrast to many other P450s (41Nordblom G.D. White R.E. Coon M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 524-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), P450 2D6 shows considerable reaction linearity in reactions supported by CuOOH (Ref. 42Zanger U.M. Hauri H.P. Loeper J. Homberg J.C. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85 (2860): 8256Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar; as confirmed here). Metoprolol oxidation mixtures were separated isocratically on an octadecylsilane (C18) column (5 µm, 4.6 × 150 mm, ODS-AM, YMC, Wilmington, NC) using a 20 mm NaClO4 (pH 2.5)/CH3CN (3:2, v/v) mixture (43Kronbach T. Mathys D. Gut J. Catin T. Meyer U.A. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The flow rate was 2.0 ml min−1, and products were detected fluorimetrically (λexcitation 222 nm, λemission 300 nm). Products were identified by comparison of t R to those obtained with authentic standards. 3P450 2D6 also catalyzes theN-deisopropylation of metoprolol (44Hayhurst G.P. Harlow J. Chowdry J. Gross E. Hilton E. Lennard M.S. Tucker G.T. Ellis S.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), but we did not analyze these products with the HPLC system we used. Bufuralol oxidation mixtures were separated on a C18 column (5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm, ODS-AQ, YMC) using a linear gradient beginning with 50% Buffer A (20 mm NaClO4 (pH 2.5)/CH3CN, 9:1, v/v) and 50% Buffer B (20 mmNaClO4 (pH 2.5)/CH3CN, 3:2, v/v), changing to 100% Buffer B over 8 min. Elution was continued for an additional 5 min while holding at 100% Buffer B, followed by a 4-min recovery period to the initial conditions. The flow rate was 2.0 ml min−1, and products were detected by UV measurements (A 254). MPTP oxidation reactions were analyzed on a Whatman SCX column (10 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) as described elsewhere (A 254 measurements) (45Shinka T. Castagnoli Jr., N. Wu E.Y. Hoag M.K.P. Trevor A.J. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 398: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Absorbance spectra were recorded using an Aminco DW2a/OLIS instrument (On-Line Instrument Systems, Bogart, GA). The interaction of substrates with P450 2D6 was examined by perturbation of the heme Soret spectra. P450 2D6 (2.0 µm) was included in a 1.0-ml cuvette containing 45 µml-α-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 0.10 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (23 °C). NADPH-P450 reductase was included at a concentration of 4.0 µm when indicated (a 2:1 ratio of reductase to P450 2D6 was found to be optimal in previous work (Ref. 32Hanna I.H. Kim M.-S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and this ratio was also used in the catalytic assays (see above)). A base line was established from 350 to 500 nm, and sequential additions (2–10 µl) of concentrated aqueous solutions of MPTP, metoprolol, or bufuralol (HCl salts) were made, recording spectra each time.Ks values were estimated by fitting plots of ΔA 388–420 nm versus ligand concentration (hyperbolic plots, using Graphpad Prism software, Graphpad, San Diego, CA). HPLC/electrospray MS studies on the determination of the structure of Δ1′,2′-dehydrobufuralol were performed using a Finnigan TSQ 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan-MAT, Sunnyvale, CA) operating in the positive ion mode with an electrospray needle voltage of 4.5 kV. N2 was used as the sheath gas (70 p.s.i.) to assist nebulization and as the auxiliary gas (10 p.s.i.) to assist with desolvation. The stainless steel capillary was heated to 200 °C, and the electrospray ionization interface and mass spectrometer parameters were optimized to obtain maximum sensitivity. The tube lens and the heated capillary were operated at 75 and 20 V, respectively, and the electron multiplier was set at 1900 V. HPLC conditions (Zorbax Rx-C8 octylsilane, 2.1 × 150 mm, Mac-Mod, Chadds Ford, PA) were as follows: flow rate 0.2 ml min−1; Solvent A, 20 mmNH4CH3CO2/CH3CN (95:5, v/v); Solvent B: 20 mmNH4CH3CO2/CH3CN (5:95, v/v); t = 0 min, 100% A; t = 12.5 min, 70% A; t = 20 min, 10% A; t = 22.5 min, 10% A; t = 25 min, 100% A; t = 30 min, 100% A. MS studies for measurement of 18O incorporation into 1′-hydroxybufuralol were performed using same mass spectrometer, source, and ion mode described above. The HPLC-isolated oxidation products were concentrated to dryness under a stream of N2, dissolved in 100 µl of CH3OH containing 1% CH3CO2H (v/v), and directly infused into the electrospray ionization source at a flow rate of 10 µl min−1. The optimized instrument parameters were as follow: electrospray needle voltage 4 kV, sheath gas (N2) 40 p.s.i., capillary temperature 200 °C, capillary voltage 20 V, tube lens 80 V, and electron multiplier voltage +1400 V. Initial experiments on the possible allosteric effect of NADPH-P450 reductase on P450 2D6 were done with MPTP because of previous reports of differences in the product profiles obtained using oxidation systems supported with NADPH-P450 reductase and CuOOH (19Modi S. Gilham D.E. Sutcliffe M.J. Lian L.-Y. Primrose W.U. Wolf C.R. Roberts G.C.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4461-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Oxidation of MPTP resulted in the formation of both the N-demethylated product PTP and the ring-hydroxylated product MPTP-OH (Fig.1) when supported by NADPH/NADPH-P450 reductase, CuOOH, or a mixture of the two (without NADPH). Only PTP was obtained when the oxidation reaction was supported by PhIO (0.3 mm, results not shown). Supplementation of PhIO-supported P450 2D6 MPTP oxidation reactions with PhI (remnant of PhIO cleavage; Refs. 24Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism, and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1995: 245-303Crossref Google Scholar and 46Macdonald T.L. Burka L.T. Wright S.T. Guengerich F.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to concentrations as high as 0.2 mm did not alter the regioselectivity of MPTP oxidation (results not shown). The addition of NADPH-P450 reductase did not change the product profile (i.e. PTP as only product) seen in the PhIO-supported system. Because the work with MPTP did not show major differences in the distribution of products from the NADPH-P450 reductase- and CuOOH-supported reactions, we examined the distribution of the multiple products of oxidation of the classic P450 2D6 substrate metoprolol (47Lennard M.S. Silas J.H. Freestone S. Tucker G.T. Ramsay L.E. Woods H.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1982; 16: 572P-573PGoogle Scholar). Oxidation of metoprolol yielded two distinct products (O-demethylmetoprolol and α-hydroxymetoprolol) when the reaction was supported with the usual NADPH/NADPH-P450 reductase system (Fig.2A). Only one product,O-demethylmetoprolol, was formed when the oxidation reaction was supported by the oxygen surrogates CuOOH (Fig. 2 B) or PhIO (results not shown). In neither case did the inclusion of NADPH-P450 reductase in CuOOH- or PhIO-supported reactions significantly influence the composition of the oxidation products (Fig.2C and other results not shown). Another classic P450 2D6 substrate is bufuralol, which was utilized in the original purifications of P450 2D6 from human liver (12Distlerath L.M. Reilly P.E.B. Martin M.V. Davis G.G. Wilkinson G.R.

FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which may be the result of the use of fluorescence detection or lack of separation of the reaction products. Bufuralol oxidation reaction mixtures were subjected to HPLC under gradient elution conditions, and both UV (A 254) and fluorescence (F 230/300) signals were monitored. The identity of the 1′-hydroxy product was verified by comparison of its mobility to that of an authentic standard. The identities of 6- and 4-hydroxybufuralol were indirectly verified by comparing their mobility and UV spectra to the P450 1A2 bufuralol oxidation products previously identified by MS and NMR (51Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Persmark M. Mimura M. Gonzalez F.J. Sugahara C. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar). Another significant product (peak 5 of Ref. 51Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Persmark M. Mimura M. Gonzalez F.J. Sugahara C. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar), which exhibited mobility similar to that of bufuralol, was yet unidentified (52Francis R.J. Allen J.G. East P.B. Ruane R.J. Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinet. 1976; : 113-124Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The product in question exhibited more intense fluorescence than bufuralol, suggesting the generation of a compound with greater bond conjugation. Relatively greater amounts of this product were obtained when P450 2D6 oxidation reactions were supported with CuOOH as compared with the usual NADPH/NADPH-P450 reductase system (see below). HPLC/MS analysis of the unidentified product indicated an apparent MH+ ion at m/z 260, 2 mass units less than the parent compound bufuralol (m/z 262, MH+) (Fig.3B). 4Very recently Hiroi et al. (53Hiroi T. Chow T. Imaoka S. Funae Y. Abstracts of the 13th International Symposium on Microsomes and Drug Oxidations. Stresa, Italy2000Google Scholar) reported a P450 2D6 bufuralol product with similar HPLC mobility andm/z 260 (MS) but did not define the site of unsaturation by other spectral methods. Comparison of our chromatograms and spectra with Drs. Hiroi and Funae indicate that Δ1′,2′-dehydrobufuralol is also the product isolated in their work.The UV spectrum of the unidentified product was different than that of the parent compound (Fig. 3 B) and identical to that of the undefined M-5 peak described previously (51Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Persmark M. Mimura M. Gonzalez F.J. Sugahara C. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease of the MH+ ion by 2 atomic mass units is consistent with only either of two stable products, the Δ1′,2′-olefin or an oxidation of the carbinol present in the substrate, barring any unusual rearrangement of the benzofuran ring system. The 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3 C) was similar to one of the unidentified components in the M-5 peak of the earlier work (51Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Persmark M. Mimura M. Gonzalez F.J. Sugahara C. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar) and is a major basis for assigning the Δ1′,2′-olefin structure (Fig.4). Key differences with the bufuralol spectrum (51Yamazaki H. Guo Z. Persmark M. Mimura M. Gonzalez F.J. Sugahara C. Guengerich F.P. Shimada T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 568-577PubMed Google Scholar) were the absence of the H-2′ (δ 1.3) and particularly the H-1′ (δ 2.9) signals from the ethyl group. The 1“ carbinol was not oxidized to a ketone because the H-2” protons are still present at δ 3.30 and 3.44. If a 1“-ketone were present, an upfield shift would have been expected. The 1” carbinol multiplet appears at δ 5.50, and subsequent experiments with another sample of this product indicated that the carbinol OH proton was overlapped. The multiplet at δ 6.76 is assigned to the two olefinic protons and the δ 6.93 multiplet to the H-1′ olefinic proton; the apparent J transcoupling constant of 12 Hz was useful in the assignment. The remaining downfield protons are singlets (H-3, δ 7.10), doublets (H-4, 6, δ 7.11, 7.15), or multiplets (H-5, δ 7.37), displaced downfield because of the increased conjugation with the aromatic system.Figure 4Oxidation products of bufuralol formed by P450 2D6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Treatment of the product with NaBH4 under typical mild conditions did not change the HPLC t R. If the carbinol (1“) had been oxidized to the ketone, bufuralol would have been the product. 1′-Hydroxybufuralol did not yield the Δ1′,2′-desaturated product (i.e. due to dehydration) under the enzyme reaction conditions. Thus, the olefin appears to be a direct oxidation product, as in the case of other desaturation reactions cata"

This model stipulates that wrapping of the promoter DNA around RNAPII and the general initiation factors TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH induces a torsional strain in the DNA double helix that facilitates strand separation and open complex formation. In this report, we show that TFIIA, a factor previously shown to both stimulate basal transcription and have co-activator functions, is located near the cross-point of the DNA loop where it can interact with TBP, TFIIE56, TFIIE34, and the RNAPII-associated protein (RAP) 74. In addition, we demonstrate that TFIIA can stimulate basal transcription by stimulating the functions of both TFIIE34 and RAP74 during the initiation step of the transcription reaction.

The first step in preinitiation complex assembly is the recognition of the TATA element of the promoter by TBP. The binding of TBP to the TATA box induces a DNA bend of ∼90o (3Kim Y. Geiger J.H.

TFIIB can associate with the TBP-promoter complex (5Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Mammalian TFIIF, which is composed of the subunits RAP74 and RAP30, directly binds to RNAPII and has been shown to participate in recruitment of the enzyme to the preinitiation complex (6Sopta M.

TFIIE, which is also composed of two subunits called TFIIE56 and TFIIE34, is involved in the melting of promoter DNA at the transcription initiation site through a mechanism that is ATP-independent (8Flores O.

Finally, TFIIH, which has kinase and helicase activities, mediates the ATP-dependent melting of the promoter DNA in the region of the initiation site and is involved in the transition between the initiation and elongation states of the complex (10Schaeffer L.

Recently, we have proposed a topological model, the DNA wrapping model, which describes transcription initiation by RNAPII (23Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell.

This model accounts for our photo-cross-linking data and several additional data obtained in various laboratories. The DNA wrapping model stipulates that a role for the general transcription factors is to help in the wrapping of the promoter DNA in the preinitiation complex in such a way that a torsional strain is progressively developed upstream of the transcription start site and results in the partial unwinding of the DNA helix. This region of unwound DNA is used as a substrate by the single-stranded DNA helicases of TFIIH that catalyze open complex formation (26Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). First isolated as a general transcription factor, TFIIA has a rather controversial role in transcription initiation. Human TFIIA is composed of three subunits: α (35 kDa), β (19 kDa), and γ (12 kDa) (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 29Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D.

Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits are encoded by the same gene and are produced by posttranslational cleavage of a precursor (29Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In yeast, TFIIA is composed of only two subunits encoded by two different genes, TOA1 and TOA2 (32Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of the polypeptide produced from the TOA1 gene is homologous to the human α subunit, and the C-terminal part is homologous to the β subunit (29Ma D. Watanabe H. Mermelstein F. Admon A. Oguri K. Sun X. Wada T. Imai T. Shiroya T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2246-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30DeJong J. Roeder R.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2220-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). TOA2 encodes a polypeptide homologous to γ (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The posttranslational cleavage of human α/β has been demonstrated to be non-essential because wild type activity can be recovered with uncleaved recombinant α/β and γ renatured together (33Sun X. Ma D. Sheldon M. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2336-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). TFIIA is not essential for basal transcription in vitro, but it has been shown to stimulate basal transcription in a variety of systems (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A.

The activators VP16 and Zta, which bind TFIIA, stimulate the assembly of a TFIIA-TFIID-promoter complex, consistent with the roles in vivo of these factors in activated transcription (46Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6465-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The function of TFIIA in transcriptional antirepression and activation have been separated and is associated with distinct subunits of the factor (35Ma D. Olave I. Merino A. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6583-6588Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subunits β and γ are essential for antirepression, whereas α is not. Conversely all three subunits are required for activation. Previous photo-cross-linking experiments performed with a TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex have revealed that TFIIA makes promoter contacts both in the region of the TATA box and upstream of it (18Coulombe B. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Lagrange T. Kim T.K. Orphanides G. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have now determined the position of TFIIA in a preinitiation complex assembled in the presence of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and RNAPII. Our results indicate that TFIIA makes promoter contacts not only on the TATA box and upstream of it in the −40 region, as is observed in the TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex, but also in the +26 region. Given the two extreme promoter positions approached by TFIIA and the small size of TFIIA (67 kDa), these results suggest that TFIIA is located near the cross-point of the wrapped DNA structure, where it can simultaneously contact nucleotides −40 and +26. TFIIF, TFIIE, and RNAPII also cross-link to the −40 and +26 positions (23Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol.

We report here that TFIIA directly interacts with RAP74, TFIIE56, and TFIIE34 in addition to the previously determined interaction with TBP. Furthermore, we use an abortive initiation assay to provide evidence that the stimulatory effect of TFIIA on basal transcription is exerted through a stimulation of the activity of RAP74 and TFIIE34 at the initiation stage of transcript formation.

Biochem. 1977; 16: 1334-2343Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) were prepared as previously described. Natural human TFIIA (nTFIIA) was partly purified using protein-affinity chromatography with immobilized TBP as we described (36Coulombe B. Killeen M. Liljelund P. Honda B. Xiao H. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human TFIIA (rTFIIA) was produced from uncleaved α/β and γ subunits that carried histidine tags (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The two polypeptides were independently purified on Ni-NTA agarose columns (Qiagen) under denaturating conditions and were either used individually as TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ or renatured together to produce rTFIIA. The synthesis of the photoreactive nucleotide N3R-dUMP, the preparation of the probes, and the conditions for binding reactions were as described (55Robert F. Coulombe B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 383-393PubMed Google Scholar). Two photoprobes containing the modified nucleotide at positions −39/−40 and +26 were used. For each probe, the concentration of poly(dI-dC) in the binding reactions was optimized to favor specific over nonspecific binding. A typical reaction with all the factors contained 200 ng each of TBP, TFIIB, RAP30, RAP74, TFIIE56, TFIIE34, rTFIIA, and RNAPII. UV irradiation, nuclease treatment, and SDS-PAGE analysis of radiolabeled photo-cross-linking products were performed as described previously (55Robert F. Coulombe B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 383-393PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions were analyzed essentially as we previously described (22Kim T.K. Lagrange T. Wang Y.H. Griffith J.D. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12268-12273Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RAP74 wt, RAP74 deletion mutants, RAP30, TFIIE34, TFIIE56, RNAPII, TFIIB, TBP, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were immobilized on Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad) at a concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml resin. Microcolumns were made with ∼20 µl of this resin. A volume of 50 µl of nTFIIA (Fig.2), recombinant TFIIAα/β, recombinant TFIIAγ (Fig. 3), or rTFIIA (Fig. 4), which contained 100 ng of nTFIIA or 200 ng of TFIIAα/β, TFIIAγ or rTFIIA, was then loaded on the different columns. The flowthrough was collected and the columns successively eluted with 50 µl of ACB buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.2 mmEDTA, 20% glycerol and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1m, 0.3 m, and 0.5 m NaCl. An aliquot of the input, the flowthrough, and the various salt elutions were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and revealed by silver (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4) or zinc staining (Fig. 3). The intensity of the bands was evaluated using the UN-SCAN-IT software. It was considered that TFIIA, or one of its subunits, was binding to a particular column when the intensity of the 0.3 m salt band was higher than the intensity of both the 0.1 m band and the flowthrough band. In contrast, when the intensity of the 0.3 m band was lower than the 0.1m or the flowthrough band, we considered that TFIIA was not binding to the column. The specificity of TFIIA binding was assessed by comparing the binding of the TFIIA subunits to the binding of a contaminant polypeptide of the nTFIIA preparation (Fig. 2).Figure 3Interactions of TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ with RAP74, TFIIE56, and TFIIE34.Protein-affinity chromatography was performed using microcolumns containing immobilized RAP74, TFIIE34, and TFIIE56.

Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (56Wolner B.S. Gralla J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3608-3615Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Complexes were assembled using highly purified TBP (20 ng), TFIIA (120 ng), and, when indicated, RAP74-(1–517) (640 ng),(1–136) (160 ng), (1–75) (91 ng), (363) (58 ng), and (363) (107 ng). Transcription assays were performed as described previously (57Burton Z.F. Ortolan L.G. Greenblatt J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). TBP (120 ng), TFIIB (120 ng), RAP30 (120 ng), RAP74 (260 ng), TFIIE34 (160 ng), TFIIE56 (240 ng), RNAPII (660 ng), and various amounts of TFIIA were incubated with 500 ng of the supercoiled DNA template containing the AdMLP from nucleotides −50 to +10 fused to a G-less cassette. Under these conditions a 391-nt run-off transcript is produced. Templates were prepared by annealing two 80-base pair DNA oligonucleotides carrying the strands of the AdMLP from −45 to +35 as described (58Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 12 ng of the double-stranded DNA template were incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with TBP (60 ng), TFIIB (30 ng), RAP30 (30 ng), RNAPII (165 ng), and, when indicated, RAP74 (65 ng), TFIIE34 (40 ng), TFIIE56 (60 ng), and various amounts of TFIIA in 20 µl of a reaction mixture containing 125 µm ATP, 125 µm CTP, 1.7 µmUTP, 2.5 µCi [α-32P]UTP, 1.25 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 125 units/ml RNase inhibitor. The synthesis was stopped by incubating at 68 °C for 3 min, and the reaction mixture then cooled on ice for 5 min. Calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (8 U, CIP) and 2 µl of 2× CIP buffer (500 mm Tris, pH 8.9, 1 mm EDTA) were added to 10 µl of the transcription reaction, and the resulting solution was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to reduce the background caused by free radiolabeled nucleotides. The CIP reaction was stopped by adding 3 µl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 200 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue). Transcripts were analyzed on a 23% polyacrylamide denaturating gel containing 7 m urea and were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). We have previously shown that TFIIA assembled with TBP on the AdMLP (e.g. TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex) cross-linked to positions −31/−29, −25/−30, −39/−40, and −42 (18Coulombe B. Li J. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19962-19967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now analyzed the position of TFIIA in a preinitiation complex composed of TBP, TFIIB, RAP74, RAP30, TFIIE56, TFIIE34, and RNAPII using site-specific protein-DNA photo-cross-linking. Both TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ cross-linked in the region of the TATA box to photoprobe −31/−29 (data not shown), upstream of it to photoprobe −39/−40 (Fig.1A, left panel) and downstream of it to photoprobe +26 (Fig. 1A, right panel). The cross-linking of TFIIA to positions −39/−40 required the presence of TBP but not that of RAP30 (Fig. 1A), TFIIB, or RNAPII (data not shown). The cross-linking of TFIIA to position +26, however, required the presence of TBP and RAP30 (Fig. 1A,right panel), as well as that of TFIIB and RNAPII (data not shown). These results indicate that promoter contacts by TFIIA in the −39/−40 region do not necessitate assembly of a preinitiation complex containing TFIIB, TFIIF, and RNAPII (e.g. a TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex is sufficient), whereas the promoter contact by TFIIA in the +26 region requires the assembly of a preinitiation complex (e.g. a TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB-TFIIF-RNAPII-TFIIE-promoter complex) in which promoter DNA adopts a wrapped structure (see Fig.1B for a schematic representation). The cross-linking of TFIIA to promoter regions downstream of the transcription initiation site (+10 to +30) was not unexpected. According to the DNA wrapping model, the DNA helices upstream of TATA (−40/−60 region) and downstream the initiation site (+10/+30 region) are juxtaposed in space. Our results provide additional support for the notion that promoter DNA is wrapped in the initiation complex and indicate that TFIIA is localized near the cross-point of the wrapped DNA structure. In the context of a preinitiation complex assembled with TFIIA, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and RNAPII, we obtained cross-linking of TFIIA to photoprobes that are also cross-linked by other components of the complex. More specifically TFIIE34, RAP74, and RAP30 cross-link to photoprobe +26, while Rpb2, TFIIE34, RAP74, and RAP30 cross-link to photoprobe −39/−40 (23Robert F. Douziech M. Forget D. Egly J.M. Greenblatt J. Burton Z.F. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 341-351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Douziech M. Coin F. Chipoulet J.M. Arai Y. Ohkuma Y. Egly J.M. Coulombe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8168-8177Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that TFIIA is in close proximity to these factors in the preinitiation complex, suggesting that TFIIA could directly interact with TFIIE, TFIIF, and RNAPII. To test this hypothesis, nTFIIA was chromatographed over different affinity columns containing immobilized RAP74, RAP30, TFIIE56, TFIIE34, TFIIB, and RNAPII. Columns containing TBP and BSA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively because TBP has been shown to interact with TFIIA (36Coulombe B. Killeen M. Liljelund P. Honda B. Xiao H. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 99-110PubMed Google Scholar, 37Cortes P. Flores O. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The flowthrough was collected in each case and the columns were successively eluted with buffer containing 0.1 m, 0.3 m, and 0.5m NaCl. The various fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Natural TFIIA (α, β, and γ subunits) was retained on the TFIIE56, TFIIE34, RAP74, and TBP columns but not on the TFIIB, RAP30, RNAPII, and BSA columns (Fig. 2). Contaminant bands of the TFIIA fraction were visible in the flowthrough of all the columns. The binding of TFIIA to the affinity columns is most easily visualized by examining the elution of the β and γ subunits. To further characterize these interactions, we next used the individual subunits of TFIIA in our affinity chromatography experiments. TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ were individually chromatographed on affinity columns containing immobilized RAP74, TFIIE34 and TFIIE56. BSA was added to the input as an internal negative control. Fig.3 shows that TFIIAα/β, but not TFIIAγ, interacts with RAP74 and TFIIE34. TFIIAα/β did not bind to the TFIIE56 column, whereas TFIIAγ was retarded on the TFIIE56 column, suggesting a weak interaction. This finding is surprising in view of the observation that nTFIIA binds strongly to the TFIIE56 column. Perhaps this is due to the association of TFIIAα/β and TFIIAγ resulting in a conformational change that favors binding to TFIIE56. Two groups have previously reported interactions between TFIIA and TFIIE. Both used recombinant TFIIA, not the natural protein. In agreement with our results, Yamamoto et al. (59Yamamoto S. Watanabe Y. van der Speck P.J. Watanabe T. Fujimoto H. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2001; 21: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) obtained binding of TFIIE56 to TFIIAγ, and Yokomori et al. (60Yokomori K. Verrijzer P.C. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6722-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) obtained binding of TFIIE34 to TFIIAα/β. However, in contrast to both our data and that of Yokomori et al. (60Yokomori K. Verrijzer P.C. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6722-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), Yamamotoet al. (59Yamamoto S. Watanabe Y. van der Speck P.J. Watanabe T. Fujimoto H. Hanaoka F. Ohkuma Y. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2001; 21: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) observed a weak binding of TFIIE34 to TFIIAγ but not to TFIIAα/β. The use of different binding assays may have caused this apparent discrepancy. Consistent with the interaction we observe, Yokomori et al. (60Yokomori K. Verrijzer P.C. Tijan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6722-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have also shown that TFIIE interacts with the TFIIA-TBP complex on promoter DNA. To determine the domain or domains of RAP74 responsible for the interaction with TFIIA, a series of RAP74 deletion mutants were immobilized on different affinity columns and rTFIIA (α/β and γ renatured together) chromatographed through each column. BSA was added to the input as an internal control, and a BSA column served as a negative control. Fig. 4Ashows some representative data, and a summary is presented in Fig.4B. All the N-terminal fragments of RAP74, except for RAP74-(1–75), which contains only the first 75 amino acids of the polypeptide, were bound by rTFIIA (Fig. 4A). Because rTFIIA did bind to RAP74-(1–136) but not to RAP74-(1–75), our results define a first domain of interaction between these two proteins that encompasses amino acids 76–136. We next used the C-terminal fragments of RAP74 in our affinity chromatography experiments. RAP74-(207–517), RAP74-(358–517), and RAP74-(407–517) were all observed to bind to RAP74, indicating the existence of a second interacting domain. To delineate this domain more precisely, two additional mutants, RAP74-(363–444) and RAP74-(363–409), were used. TFIIA bound well to RAP74-(363–444) but not to RAP74-(363–409) (Fig. 4A). These results define a second TFIIA-interacting domain of RAP74 located between amino acids 410 and 444. The existence of an additional putative TFIIA-binding domain in the central RAP74 region was ruled out by passing rTFIIA on columns containing RAP74–(136-258) and RAP74-(258–356). In each case, rTFIIA was not retained on the column. The two TFIIA-interacting domains of RAP74 that we identified are both localized in conserved regions of the protein, domain 76–136 being localized in conserved region I and domain 410–444 in conserved region III (see Fig. 4B for a schematic representation). To assess whether or not RAP74 can associate with TFIIA on promoter DNA, we performed gel mobility shift experiments. RAP74 fragments carrying the TFIIA-binding domains (e.g. RAP74-(1–517;wt), RAP74-(1–136), and RAP74-(363–444)) but not fragments lacking the TFIIA-binding regions (e.g. RAP74-(1–75) and RAP74-(363–409)) gel shifted a TBP-TFIIA-promoter complex (Fig.5). These results indicate that RAP74, through both its TFIIA-binding domains, can associate with TFIIA on promoter DNA. Several reports have shown that TFIIA can stimulate basal transcription by RNAPII in vitro, but is not essential for the basal transcription reaction (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Sun X. Ma D. Sheldon M. Yeung K. Reinberg D.

For example, recombinant TFIIA increased the formation of a 391-nt run-off transcript from a supercoiled template carrying the AdMLP fused to a G-less cassette in the presence of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and core RNAPII (Fig. 6A). To test whether or not TFIIA acts on the initiation step of the transcription reaction, we developed an abortive initiation assay in which an 80-base pair double-stranded oligonucleotide carrying the AdMLP was used to drive transcription initiation in the presence of RNAPII and the general transcription factors. In this assay only abortive transcripts of 2 to 10 nt in length can be synthesized because the transcription reaction is performed in the absence of GTP on a template that harbors a G at position +11 (see Fig. 6B). Abortive initiation was shown to be promoter-specific because the use of DNA templates with mutations in the AdMLP that impair transcription in run-off assays did not support synthesis of abortive transcripts. 2M. F. Langelier, Y. Porlier, and B. Coulombe, manuscript in preparation. Under our reaction conditions, abortive initiation minimally requires the presence of TBP, TFIIB, RAP30, and RNAPII (Fig. 6). With this minimal set of factors, the addition of TFIIA does not stimulate the formation of abortive transcripts (Fig. 6, B and C). When either RAP74 alone, or RAP74 and TFIIE34 are added to the system, the formation of abortive transcripts is increased, indicating that these two factors are involved in transcriptional initiation (Fig. 6, data not shown, and Refs. 58Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Lei L. Ren D. Burton Z.F.B. Mol. Cel.

The addition of TFIIA to reactions containing either RAP74 alone, or RAP74 and TFIIE34, in addition to TBP, TFIIB, RAP30, and RNAPII, had a stimulatory effect (Fig. 6,B and C), indicating that TFIIA can stimulate the initiation stage of the transcription reaction. Because TFIIA stimulates transcription initiation only when RAP74 and TFIIE34 are present in the reaction, our results suggest that TFIIA enhances the functions of TFIIF and TFIIE to stimulate the basal transcription reaction. The role of TFIIA in RNAPII transcription is not completely resolved. However, several reports suggest that an important function of this factor is to act as a co-factor in transcriptional activation (28Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M.

In this paper, we establish the existence of structural and functional interactions between TFIIA and both TFIIE and TFIIF within the initiation complex. TFIIE and TFIIF have been shown to be involved in the melting of promoter DNA near the initiation site during open complex formation (9Holstege F.C. Tantin D. Carey M. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 58Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering that an activator such as Gal4-VP16, whose full activity requires the presence of TFIIA, can stimulate promoter melting near the initiation site (63Wang W. Carey M. Gralla J.D. Science. 1992; 255: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), it is possible to envision an activation mechanism in which TFIIA functions as a bridge between the activator proteins and the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF. This connection may help to explain how upstream activators influence and stimulate the biochemical events occurring at the transcription start site.

In yeast, HSF is constitutively bound to DNA; however, the mitigation of negative regulation in response to stress dramatically increases transcriptional activity. Through alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the surface residues of the DNA-binding domain, we have identified a large number of mutants with increased transcriptional activity. Six of the strongest mutations were selected for detailed study. Our studies suggest that the DNA-binding domain is involved in the negative regulation of both the N-terminal and C-terminal activation domains of HSF. These mutations do not significantly affect DNA binding. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that a subset of the mutants may have altered secondary structure, whereas a different subset has decreased thermal stability. Our findings suggest that the regulation of HSF transcriptional activity (under both constitutive and stressed conditions) may be partially dependent on the local topology of the DNA-binding domain. In addition, the DNA-binding domain may mediate key interactions with ancillary factors and/or other intramolecular regulatory regions in order to modulate the complex regulation of HSF's transcriptional activity.

In eukaryotes, the increased expression of heat shock proteins is regulated by the heat shock transcription factor (HSF).1 HSF binds to a conserved DNA sequence called a heat shock element (HSE), which is defined as a series of alternating, inverted repeats of the conserved sequence NGAAN (1Amin J. Ananthan J. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3761-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 2Xiao H. Lis J.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). HSEs range in size from two to more than six repeats, and all heat shock promoters have at least one three-repeat HSE or two proximal two-repeat HSEs. The two-repeat HSEs can be arranged in either a head-to-head (NGAANNTTCN) or tail-to-tail (NTTCNNGAAN) orientation. The strength of HSF's activation depends primarily on the number of HSEs within the promoter and secondarily on the sequence of the non-conserved “N” residues and the orientation of the binding site. Budding yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have only a single HSF, which is an essential gene that has a constitutive function (3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 4Wiederrecht G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under all cellular conditions, yeast HSF appears to be localized in the nucleus in a DNA-binding competent form (5Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5040-5042Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 6Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Key to the function of yeast HSF is the fact that it has different levels of transcriptional activity in response to different cellular conditions. Under constitutive or normal growth conditions, yeast HSF has a low level of transcriptional activity, which can vary 10-fold between growth at 15 and 30 °C (3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). After heat shock or stress, yeast HSF acquires a high level of transcriptional activity, which can be up to 200-fold greater after a transient 30-min heat shock at 39 °C (3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This increased level diminishes rapidly once the transient stress is removed. If cells are shocked and maintained at the heat shock temperature for several hours, there is an early peak of activity, which then readjusts to a basal level that is significantly higher than the level prior to the increase in temperature (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Jakobsen and colleagues (8Hjorth-Sorensen B. Hoffmann E.R. Lissin N.M. Sewell A.K. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have shown that yeast heat shock activation responds to a change in temperature, rather than an absolute temperature. There are at least four clearly defined domains for the S. cerevisiae gene HSF1 (Fig. 1). The central core, responsible for DNA binding and oligomerization, has been highly conserved in all HSFs. The trimerization domain consists of a three-stranded coiled-coil (9Sorger P.K. Nelson H.C.M. Cell. 1989; 59: 807-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 10Peteranderl R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3559-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain is a variation of the winged-helix-turn-helix motif (12Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), with an unusual α-helical bulge and proline-centered kink combination in its second helix (i.e. the first helix of the helix-turn-helix motif) (13Hardy J.A. Walsh S.T. Nelson H.C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Hardy J.A. Nelson H.C.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2128-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are two activation domains, located at the N and C termini of the protein. The N-terminal activation domain is found within the first 170 amino acids (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Nieto S.J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), with the most potent part of the activation domain within the first 66 amino acids. 2E. E. Powers and H. C. M. Nelson, unpublished data. The C-terminal activation domain is located between residues 595 and 783 (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Nieto S.J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Barlev N.A. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5007-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The activation domains appear to play different roles, with the N-terminal activation domain responsible for the initial transient increase in activity in response to stress and the C-terminal activation domain responsible for the more sustained stress response (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, either activation domain can be deleted without affecting viability at constitutive (i.e. non-heat shock) temperatures (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 15Nieto S.J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal activation domain results in a temperature-sensitive phenotype, emphasizing its role in the ability of yeast to thrive at higher growth temperatures. In addition, the C-terminal activation domain is critical for the heat-induced or glucose starvation-induced increase of expression of the metallothionein gene CUP1, a non-canonical heat shock gene, but not for the heat-induced increase of expression of SSA1 andSSA3, two of the yeast Hsp70 homologues (17Tamai K.T. Liu X. Silar P. Sosinowski T. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8155-8165Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The regulation of yeast HSF's activity occurs at many levels, although it appears to function primarily through negative regulation of HSF's activity in the absence of stress. The level and extent of yeast HSF's phosphorylation is dependent on cellular conditions (3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that protein kinases and phosphatases are involved in regulating HSF's activity. Studies on HSF from Kluyveromyces lactis, which is closely related to S. cerevisiae, have shown that phosphorylation is likely involved in repressing HSF's activity after stress is removed (18Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that heat shock proteins help to repress mammalian HSF's activity after the removal of stress (19Shi Y. Mosser D.D. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 20Zuo J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), although it is not clear whether this is the case in yeast (8Hjorth-Sorensen B. Hoffmann E.R. Lissin N.M. Sewell A.K. Jakobsen B.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 914-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Bonner J.J. Carlson T. Fackenthal D.L. Paddock D. Storey K. Lea K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1739-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At least four cis-acting regions of yeast HSF have been identified as important in the regulation of its activity. In particular, they are involved in restraint of HSF's activity in the absence of stress, as their deletion causes an increase in HSF's constitutive activity, suggesting that these regions function as negative regulators by masking the activation domains. This negative regulation could occur through intermolecular interactions with other proteins or through intramolecular interactions between these cis-acting regions and the activation domains. The four cis-acting regions include N-terminal and C-terminal regulatory regions, as well as the DNA-binding and trimerization domains (Fig. 1). Deletion of the N-terminal regulatory region, located between residues 40 and 170, results in a total removal of the negative regulation of the C-terminal activation domain, such that HSF has the same high level of activity before and after stress (7Sorger P.K. Cell. 1990; 62: 793-805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 22Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of the CE2 regulatory region, located between residues 532 and 552 and including a short C-terminal hydrophobic heptad repeat and several critical serine residues, also results in HSF with an increased constitutive activity (18Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 23Jakobsen B.K. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the CE2 regulatory region is involved in the sustained, rather than the transient heat shock response, it is likely regulating the C-terminal activation domain, rather than the N-terminal activation domain (18Hoj A. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although no definitive studies have been reported to support this. The central core, which encompasses the DNA-binding and trimerization domains, is also involved in repressing transcriptional activity (15Nieto S.J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Studies on a series of fusions between fragments of HSF and a heterologous DNA-binding domain have shown that removal of the central core increases HSF's transcriptional activity (15Nieto S.J. Wiederrecht G. Okuda A. Parker C.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 807-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several studies have shown that point mutations within either the DNA-binding or trimerization domains cause an increase in constitutive and/or induced transcriptional activity (13Hardy J.A. Walsh S.T. Nelson H.C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Hardy J.A. Nelson H.C.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2128-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Barlev N.A. Westergaard O. Jakobsen B.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5007-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 22Bonner J.J. Heyward S. Fackenthal D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Sewell A.K. Yokoya F., Yu, W. Miyagawa T. Murayama T. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25079-25086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain mutations include M232V, identified as increasing the activity of a heterologous VP16 transcriptional activation domain, and R206S, identified as one of two mutations within HSF responsible for high basal transcription of the metallothionein geneCUP1, known to be regulated by HSF. In addition, a detailed study of the bulged-kinked second helix of the DNA-binding domain showed that it was critical for transcriptional activity; removal of the α-helical bulge through single amino acid deletions causes an increase in transcriptional activity that might be related to thermal destabilization of the DNA-binding domain (13Hardy J.A. Walsh S.T. Nelson H.C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Substitution of the conserved proline, which is located at the center of the kink, by a lysine (though not alanine) causes an increase in transcriptional activity (14Hardy J.A. Nelson H.C.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2128-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). None of these studies looked systematically at how these domains influenced activity, nor did they analyze whether the central core has differential regulation of the two activation domains. In order to explore further the role of the DNA-binding domain in regulating transcriptional activity, we have studied the transcriptional activity of a series of alanine-scanning mutants that cover the surface of the DNA-binding domain (12Harrison C.J. Bohm A.A. Nelson H.C. Science. 1994; 263: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 25Hubl S.T. Owens J.C. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The majority of the surface residue mutations cause a change in transcriptional activity compared with wild-type HSF. Of these, only a small number decrease transcriptional activity, whereas ∼80% cause an increase in transcriptional activity. By mapping the positions of these residues onto the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain, we can conclude that multiple surfaces of the DNA-binding domain are involved in regulation of transcriptional activity. We have focused on six of the mutants with the largest increase in transcriptional activity. We analyzed how the mutations affected the transcriptional phenotype in the absence of one or other of the activation domains. Our results show that the DNA-binding domain is involved in negative regulation of both the N- and C-terminal activation domains. Intriguingly, we also found that specific residues differentially affected the activity of the two transcriptional activation domains. The ability of the DNA-binding domain mutations to influence transcriptional activity does not appear to be related to changes in DNA-binding affinity, but may be related, in some cases, to changes in the thermal stability and/or structure of the domain. Models for how the DNA-binding domain influences negative regulation of transcriptional activity are discussed. The DNA-binding domain mutants used for yeast expression were all constructed from pHN1002, aCEN/AR4S/TRP1 yeast shuttle vector carrying a full-length copy of the S. cerevisiae HSF1 gene expressed from its own promoter (25Hubl S.T. Owens J.C. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Construction of the full-length versions of the alanine-scanning mutants has been described (25Hubl S.T. Owens J.C. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncations of specific alanine-substitutions were based on pHN2256, a version of pHN1002 that includes the first 583 residues of HSF followed by valine and asparagine as cloning artifacts and then a stop codon (gift of E. E. Powers). The DNA-binding domain mutations were transferred from the full-length background into pHN2256 using uniqueBamHI and StyI sites. N-terminal truncations of specific alanine substitutions used the plasmid pHN2241, a version of pHN1002 in which residues 145–833 are expressed from the naturalHSF1 promoter (gift of E. E. Powers). This plasmid was digested with NcoI (which was blunted by filling-in with DNA polymerase) and StyI; this creates a backbone that includes the HSF1 promoter and the last 440 residues of HSF. Plasmids containing the full-length HSF versions of the mutants were digested with BamHI (which was blunted by filling-in with DNA polymerase) and StyI; this creates a fragment of HSF containing residues from 67 to 393. Ligation of these restriction fragments with the digested pHN2241 resulted in plasmids that used the natural HSF1 promoter to express residues 67–833 of HSF, preceded by methionine and aspartate (cloning artifact) at the N terminus. The yeast expression plasmids were all transformed into the tester strain PS145 (gift of P. Sorger). This strain is a haploid derivative of S. cerevisiae W303 (MATaade2–1 trp1 can1–100 leu2, 3–112 his3–11, 15 ura3), which carries theHSF1Δ2::LEU2 chromosomal disruption and a wild-type HSF1 gene under the control of aGAL1 promoter on a derivative of theURA3-containing plasmid YCp50 (3Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar); it can only grow when galactose is present. The transformants were tested for their ability to grown in the absence of galactose. Once it was confirmed that the particular alanine-substituted HSF was sufficient to allow viability (25Hubl S.T. Owens J.C. Nelson H.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the transformant was cured of the pGAL1-HSF1 URA3-based plasmid by growth on 5-fluoroorotic acid and uracil (26Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The resultant cells were transformed with the plasmid pHSE2-lacZ, a 2-µm URA3-based plasmid in which the lacZgene is driven by a synthetic heat shock promoter (6Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Single colonies from a fresh plate were used to inoculate selective synthetic media. The cells were grown at 30 °C for 15–18 h until the cells were in early log phase growth (A 600 ∼ 0.3). To heat induce the cells, 5 ml of culture were transferred into a warm culture tube and shaken in a 42 °C water bath for 30 min, followed by a recovery growth period in a 30 °C shaking water bath for 90 min. For every strain with a mutant HSF, two to five colonies were assayed with a non-induced and induced culture for each colony. There were some minor differences in the assays done for the original 58 full-length HSF mutants and the assays done later for the 6 HSF mutants with increased transcriptional activity. Because all of the 58 full-length HSF mutants could not be tested within a single day, care was taken to ensure reproducibility from day to day. As an additional control, at least two colonies with wild-type HSF were tested each day that the assay was performed. Each set of raw data from each mutant was compared with the entire set of data from all of the wild-type controls. In order to analyze the data, Student's t test assuming equal variance was used from the statistical package in Microsoft Excel. The significance value was set at 0.5. For the six mutant HSFs, the assays were grouped according to the length of the HSF construct, i.e. HSF-(1–583), HSF-(66–833), or HSF-(1–833). Within a single day, all six mutants and wild-type HSF could be tested, and each set of mutants was tested over several days. Because HSF-(1–583) grows poorly, all three sets of these mutants were grown in selective synthetic media with 3% dextrose (compared with 2% dextrose found in standard recipes). β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (6Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3035-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,27Ausubel F.H. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols In Molecular Biology. 2nd Ed. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). Briefly, crude yeast extract was prepared from 3–4.5 ml of cells, which were resuspended in 200 µl of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol). 10 µl of 10% Triton X-100 and 200 µl of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 µm, Sigma) was added, followed by a 10-min incubation on ice. The tubes were then vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C, and the cell debris was separated from the crude extract by a 10-min centrifugation. Total protein concentration was estimated using a Bradford protein assay. For the assay, typically 100 µl (for the non-induced cells) or 50 µl (for the induced cells) of crude cell extract was added to Z buffer to a final volume of 500 µl. To start the assay, 100 µl of 4 mg/ml ONPG (in 0.1 mKPO4) was added and the tubes placed in a 28 °C water bath. The reaction was stopped by raising the pH with the addition 250 µl of 1 m Na2CO3; this addition was done either at the appearance of a yellow color or at a 4-h maximum time point. The amount of the cleavage produce was detected by absorbance at 420 nm. The activity was calculated as (A 420)/(t·v·p), where t is time in minutes, v is volume of extract in microliters, and p is protein concentration in mg/ml. Cells were grown to saturation or to early log phase. Typically, 1.5 ml (saturated cells) or 4.5 ml (log phase cells) were pelleted and resuspended by vortexing in 200 µl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (0.125 m Tris (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol). The tubes were boiled for 5 min and incubated on ice for 5 min. Following addition of 100 µl of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 µm, Sigma), the tubes were vortexed for 10 min at 4 °C and boiled for 5 min, and then the cell debris was separated from the crude extract by a 10-min centrifugation at 4 °C. The amount of crude extract was quantitated using the Pierce BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was electroblotted overnight onto an Immobilon filter (Millipore), which was probed with one of two different rabbit anti-HSF antibodies (gifts of P. Sorger and D. Gross). The blots were analyzed either by a colorimetric assay (using a goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate) or by chemiluminescence (using a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate). The expression plasmid pHN136, previously described as Sc-DT(73L) (28Flick K.E. Gonzalez Jr., L. Harrison C.J. Nelson H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12475-12481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is a derivative of pET-3b (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 60-89Crossref Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) and contains the coding sequence for S. cerevisiae HSF amino acid residues 171–424, which includes the DNA-binding and trimerization domains. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain were introduced into pHN136 by a megaprimer polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis approach and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids are named pHN484 (K178A), pHN485 (D185A), pHN487 (R206A), pHN488 (N222A), pHN489 (H236A), and pHN490 (K237A). The pET-3b expression vectors were transformed into theEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 185: 60-89Crossref Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) containing a derivative of the plasmid pAcYc177 (30Stark M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 51: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) that overexpresseslac repressor. Cells were grown shaking at 37 °C in Terrific Broth containing 50 µg/ml each ampicillin and kanamycin until they reached an A 600 of ∼0.5. Cells were induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 3.75 mm, grown for an additional 3 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at −20 °C. The frozen pellets were thawed and resuspended in an equal volume of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 600 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol. Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated by shaking at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell suspension was sonicated, and the lysed cells were centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 20 min at 10 °C. The high speed supernatant was precipitated by addition of saturated ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 18%. The mixture was centrifuged at 39,000 × g for 20 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in a minimal volume of 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), and 600 mm NaCl. All column chromatography was conducted on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AKTA Prime chromatography system at 4 °C, with absorbance and conductivity monitored simultaneously. The resuspended pellet was loaded onto a HiPrep 16/10 butyl column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 600 mmNaCl, 18% (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) 600 mm NaCl, 9% (NH4)2SO4. The column was developed with a reversed ammonium sulfate gradient; the protein started to elute at 4% (NH4)2SO4. The column fractions containing wild-type or mutant HSF fragments were pooled and concentrated to a volume of less than 20 ml with a Centriprep filtration unit (Millipore) at 10 kDa cut-off. The protein solution was desalted on HiTrap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7). The desalted protein was loaded onto a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7). The column was developed with a NaCl gradient and the protein eluted between 650 and 850 mm NaCl. The column fractions containing wild-type or mutant HSF fragments were again pooled and concentrated to a volume of less than 5 ml with a Centriprep 10 filtration unit (Millipore) at 10 kDa cut-off. If the protein appeared greater than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE, then it was desalted on HiTrap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7). If the protein appeared less than 95% pure by SDS-PAGE, then it was loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris (pH 6.7). In either case, the purified proteins were lyophilized to dryness and stored at −20 °C. For subsequent analyses, the lyophilized protein was resuspended in the appropriate buffer and protein concentration was determined by Lowry protein assays or by absorbance at 280 nm using a protein extinction coefficient of 32,290 cm−1m−1. Binding of wild-type and mutant HSF fragments to DNA was performed using variations of previously described protocols (13Hardy J.A. Walsh S.T. Nelson H.C.M. J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2072684485,"Mog1 is a nuclear protein that interacts with Ran, the Ras family GTPase that confers directionality to nuclear import and export pathways. Deletion of MOG1 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Δmog1) causes temperature-sensitive growth and defects in nuclear protein import. Mog1 has previously been shown to stimulate GTP release from Ran and we demonstrate here that addition of Mog1 to either Ran-GTP or Ran-GDP results in nucleotide release and formation of a stable complex between Mog1 and nucleotide-free Ran. Moreover, MOG1 shows synthetic lethality with PRP20, the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF) that also binds nucleotide-free Ran. To probe the functional role of the Mog1-Ran interaction, we engineered mutants of yeast Mog1 and Ran that specifically disrupt their interaction bothin vitro and in vivo. These mutants indicate that the interaction interface involves conserved Mog1p residues Asp62 and Glu65, and residue Lys136in yeast Ran. Mutations at these residues decrease the ability of Mog1 to bind and release nucleotide from Ran. Furthermore, the E65K-Mog1 and K136E-Ran mutations in yeast cause temperature sensitivity and mislocalization of a nuclear import reporter protein, similar to the phenotype observed for the Δmog1 strain. Our results indicate that a primary function of Mog1 requires binding to Ran and that the Mog1-Ran interaction is necessary for efficient nuclear protein import in vivo.

Import receptors bind cargo in the absence of Ran-GTP whereas export receptors bind cargo in a trimeric complex with Ran-GTP (reviewed in Ref. 1Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The directionality of transport is based on nuclear Ran being primarily GTP-bound and cytoplasmic Ran mainly GDP-bound. Ran-GTP is generated in the nucleus by the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF),1 RCC1 (2Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 3Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G.

Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), is localized in the cytoplasm (5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J.

NTF2 recycles Ran-GDP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (7Ribbeck K. Lipowsky G. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6587-6598Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 8Smith A. Brownawell A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1403-1406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where Ran-GTP is regenerated by RCC1. Thus, the asymmetric distribution of the two nucleotide states of Ran, vital to the directionality of nuclear transport, is maintained through the concerted efforts of several Ran-binding proteins, including RCC1, RanGAP1, and NTF2. Mog1, a recently identified Ran-binding protein, appears to have a novel role in regulating the Ran GTPase cycle. Mog1p was first isolated in yeast as a suppressor of temperature-sensitive alleles of theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ran homologue, Gsp1p (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mog1 is predominantly nuclear and both Mog1 and its interaction with Ran are evolutionarily conserved (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The yeast Δmog1 strain is temperature-sensitive for growth and shows defects in signal-mediated protein import, suggesting a role for Mog1p in nuclear protein import (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The temperature sensitivity of Δmog1is suppressed by overexpression of either GSP1 orNTF2 and many of the temperature-sensitive gsp1mutants suppressed by MOG1 are also suppressed byNTF2 (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The genetic interaction between MOG1and NTF2 implies that the functions of these two proteins may at least partially overlap. Recently, Mog1 has been reported to stimulate nucleotide release from Ran-GTP (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Oki M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32894-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although these observations suggest an involvement of Mog1 in regulating the nucleotide state of Ran, the precise function of Mog1 in Ran-coordinated nuclear transport has not been defined. We previously described the 1.9-Å resolution crystal structure ofS. cerevisiae Mog1p and identified a highly conserved cluster of surface residues as a putative Ran-binding site (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we have used structure-based targeted mutagenesis of yeast Mog1p and Gsp1p to probe the interaction interface of the protein complex and the cellular function of this interaction. We show that the conserved acidic surface residues Asp62 and Glu65 of Mog1p are important in maintaining the Mog1-Ran interaction. Although Mog1p and Ntf2p cannot bind Gsp1p simultaneously (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), they do not appear to bind to the same site. Hence, mutations in the switch I and II loop regions of Ran that disrupt NTF2 binding (14Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) do not prevent Mog1 binding and conversely, residue Lys136 in Gsp1p is required for interaction with Mog1p but not with Ntf2p. The E65K-Mog1p and K136E-Gsp1p mutations decrease the strength of the Mog1-Ran interaction and cause defects in growth and nuclear protein import in yeast, indicating that a direct Mog1-Ran interaction is important for these functions in vivo. Yeast Mog1p was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (15Baker R.P. Stewart M. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). His-tagged human Mog1, which is 29% identical and 47% similar to yeast Mog1p, was expressed and purified as described (12Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Yeast Ntf2p was prepared as previously described for vertebrate NTF2 (16Kent H.M. Clarkson W.D. Bullock T.L. Stewart M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the yeast homologue of importin-β, Kap95p, was purified according to the protocol used for vertebrate importin-β (17Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of GSP1 was amplified by PCR and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to generate an NH2-terminal His-tag. His-tagged Gsp1p was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity and gel filtration chromatography (12Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The nucleotide state of Gsp1p was modulated by incubating the bacterially expressed protein with GDP, GTP, mantGDP, or mantGTP at 100-fold molar excess in the presence of 20 mm EDTA for 30 min at room temperature. Nucleotide exchange was completed by the addition of 40 mm MgCl2. Unbound nucleotide was removed and the Gsp1p exchanged into the desired buffer using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild-type canine Ran and Ran mutants were expressed as described (14Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and charged with GDP or GTP as described above. To improve protein expression and stability of recombinant Mog1p, we created an NH2-terminal truncation construct that uses Met31 as the translation start site. Amino-terminal truncated Mog1p retained the ability to bind Gsp1p in vitroand complemented the temperature-sensitive phenotype ofΔmog1 (data not shown). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into Mog1p and Gsp1p expression constructs by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene). For expression in yeast, MOG1 andGSP1 open reading frames cloned in pBluescript (Stratagene) were mutagenized and then subcloned into yeast plasmids. For each mutant, the presence of the desired mutations and absence of extraneous mutations was confirmed by sequencing the open reading frame. Gsp1p mutants were screened for binding to Mog1p-Sepharose and Ntf2p-Sepharose beads as described (18Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were pre-bound to Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. Binding to the immobilized His-tagged protein was assayed in reactions containing an excess of the second protein in 0.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline/MgCl2. Following incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, unbound material was removed by washing the beads extensively with buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and then examined by SDS-PAGE. Crystals of E65A-Mog1p and E65K-Mog1p were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion using the conditions employed for the wild-type protein (15Baker R.P. Stewart M. Acta Cryst. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and had P212121 symmetry. A 1.9-Å resolution data set was collected on beamline EH14–2 (ESRF, Grenoble) using 0.933-Å wavelength radiation (Table I) and processed using MOSFLM and SCALA (CCP4). The E65A-Mog1p structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMORE (CCP4) and the wild-type structure (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The structural model obtained after refinement using CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Open table in a new tab Gsp1p (20 µm) charged with either mantGDP or mantGTP (synthesized as described previously (20Jameson D.M. Eccleston J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 363-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar)) was mixed with an equimolar quantity of wild-type or mutant Mog1p or, as a control, with buffer alone (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by gel filtration chromatography using a calibrated Superdex 75 FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed for protein content by measuring absorbance at 280 nm and for mant nucleotide content by exciting at 366 nm and measuring fluorescence emission at 450 nm. Peak fractions were also concentrated and examined by SDS-PAGE to determine which fractions contained Gsp1p, Mog1p, or both (data not shown). A complete deletion of theMOG1 open reading frame was created using a previously described PCR-based strategy (21Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) in the wild-type diploid ACY247 (22Jones A.L. Quimby B.B. Hood J.K. Ferrigno P. Keshava P.H. Silver P.A. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3224-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The heterozygous diploid was subsequently sporulated and tetrads were dissected to generate the haploid Δmog1 strain (ACY547). The prp20–1Δmog1 double mutant (ACY495) was created by deleting the MOG1 open reading frame in the haploidprp20-1 mutant (23Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Deletion of MOG1 was confirmed by PCR. The E65K mutation was introduced into theMOG1 open reading frame cloned in the HIS3integrating plasmid, pRS303 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E65K-Mog1 was then integrated at the endogenous MOG1 locus by linearization ofE65K-Mog1-pRS303 (pAC868) and transformation into the wild-type haploid ACY193 (25Winston F. Dollard C. Ricupero-Hovasse S.L. Yeast. 1995; 11: 53-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) to create ACY548. Transformants that grew on plates lacking histidine were selected and the presence of theE65K-Mog1 mutation was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. To generate cells carrying K136E-Gsp1p or Myc-tagged Gsp1p plasmids as the sole source of Gsp1p, Δgsp1Δgsp2 cells (ACY212) (26Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) were transformed with centromeric plasmids encoding K136E-Gsp1p (pAC838), myc-Gsp1p (pAC627), or myc-K136E-Gsp1p (pAC839) and streaked on 5-fluoroorotic acid to remove the wild-type GSP1 plasmid (27Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). For growth analysis, yeast cells were grown to saturation in selective media at 25 °C. Cells were diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml and shifted to 37 °C. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density (A600 nm) at 2-h intervals. Growth on plates was assessed by growing cultures to saturation as above, serial diluting them (1:10), and spotting onto plates. Plates were incubated at either 25 or 37 °C for 5 days. Yeast expressing myc-Gsp1p or myc-K136E-Gsp1p as the only source of Gsp1p were transformed with 2 µ galactose inducible plasmids (28Schlenstedt G. Wong D.H. Koepp D.M. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) encoding GST alone (pAC403), GST-Mog1p (pAC590), GST-D62K-Mog1p (pAC877), or GST-E65K-Mog1p (pAC878). GST binding experiments were performed as described previously (12Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) except that cells were induced with galactose for 4 h at room temperature. One µg of total protein from lysate and unbound samples and 30 µl of the bound sample were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, then transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with monoclonal α-Myc antibody (1:2000 dilution) or α-GST antibody (1:500 dilution). To analyze the mutant proteins and confirm their expression at equivalent levels to wild-type protein, equal concentrations of lysates (generally ∼10 µg of total protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either monoclonal α-Myc antibody (1:2000 dilution) or a polyclonal α-Mog1p antibody (1:5000 dilution). An NLS-GAL4AD-GFP reporter plasmid (pAC697) (29Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was transformed into wild-type (ACY193),Δmog1 (ACY547), E65K-Mog1(ACY548), andK136E-Gsp1 (ACY570) yeast cells. Cells were grown to log phase at 25 °C and shifted to 37 °C for 4 h. For all experiments, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole to visualize the DNA and confirm the location of the nucleus (data not shown). The localization of the NLS reporter was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. The crystal structure of Mog1p showed a cluster of highly conserved residues (Fig. 1A) on a ∼25-Å diameter surface patch (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Many of these residues are charged and could potentially form intermolecular salt bridges with oppositely charged residues on Ran. We targeted these charged residues on Mog1p for mutagenesis and compared the mutant proteins to wild-type Mog1p for their ability to bind Gsp1p-GDP and Gsp1p-GTP. Wild-type Mog1p bound to Gsp1p in either nucleotide state (Fig. 1B), although the amount of Gsp1p-GTP bound was greater than Gsp1p-GDP. The binding of Gsp1p in both nucleotide states to Mog1p beads is consistent with recent reports that Mog1 binds not only Ran-GTP as initially suggested (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but Ran-GDP as well (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Marfatia K.A. Harreman M.T. Fanara P. Vertino P.M. Corbett A.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 266: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although mutations at Arg58 (R58A or R58E) did not reduce Gsp1p binding (data not shown), mutations at either Asp62 (D62K) or Glu65 (E65K and E65A) significantly reduced the affinity of Mog1p for both nucleotide states of Gsp1p in vitro (Fig.1B). The effect of the Mog1p mutations was even more pronounced in vivo since the amount of Gsp1p that co-purified with GST-tagged Mog1p from yeast cells was decreased to undetectable levels for both D62K-Mog1p and E65K-Mog1p (Fig.1C). Since residues Asp62 and Glu65 are on the surface of Mog1p, it is unlikely that mutating them to lysine would cause an overall conformational change in the molecule. To investigate the effect of mutations in these residues, we used crystallography and CD spectroscopy. We solved the crystal structure of the E65A-Mog1p mutant by molecular replacement to 2.0-Å resolution (TableI). The Cα root mean square deviation between the E65A-Mog1p and wild-type Mog1p crystal structures was 0.31 Å indicating that negligible conformational changes had been introduced by the mutation. Similar crystals were also obtained for the D62K-Mog1p and E65K-Mog1p mutants, suggesting that they too retained the same three-dimensional structure as wild-type Mog1p, although a severe twinning problem prevented us from obtaining high-resolution crystal structures for these two mutants. The CD spectra for wild-type Mog1p and the mutants were identical (data not shown), consistent with the mutants having the same conformation as wild-type Mog1p. Our binding experiments (Fig. 1B) suggested that, in contrast to previous reports (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Oki M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32894-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Mog1 might bind and stimulate nucleotide release from both the GDP- and GTP-bound states of Ran. To investigate this possibility in more detail, we developed a guanine nucleotide release assay using the fluorescent nucleotide analogues, mantGDP and mantGTP, which are comparable to unmodified nucleotides in their affinity for Ran (30Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12543-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Following incubation of Mog1p with Gsp1p-mantGDP or Gsp1p-mantGTP, samples were resolved by gel filtration and fractions were examined for protein absorbance and fluorescence emission. This allowed the relative amounts of Mog1p-Gsp1p complex, free protein monomers, and free nucleotide to be compared. This assay demonstrated that addition of Mog1p to either nucleotide state of Gsp1p generated a 1:1 complex between wild-type Mog1p and nucleotide-free Gsp1p with the concomitant release of either GDP or GTP, whereas in the absence of Mog1p, the fluorescent nucleotide remained stably bound to Gsp1p (Fig. 2,A and B). The Mog1p mutants were also assayed for their ability to bind Gsp1p and stimulate nucleotide release. Compared with wild-type Mog1p, significantly reduced levels of complex formation and nucleotide release were observed when the Mog1p mutants were incubated with either nucleotide state of Gsp1p (Fig. 2, Aand B). Because E65K-Mog1p displayed a more dramatic decrease in Ran binding than D62K-Mog1pin vitro, we chose to examine the effects of the E65K mutation in S. cerevisiae. To assess the in vivofunction of E65K-Mog1p, we integrated E65K-Mog1 at the endogenous MOG1 locus making E65K-Mog1p the only form of Mog1p expressed in these cells. Cells lacking MOG1 are temperature sensitive for growth at 37 °C (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine if the E65K-Mog1p mutant also conferred a temperature-sensitive growth phenotype, we compared the growth of E65K-Mog1 cells to wild-type and Δmog1 cells (Fig.3). We found that E65K-Mog1cells grew more slowly than wild-type cells at 37 °C. The phenotype observed was not as profound as in cells lacking Mog1p (Fig.3B), suggesting that either the Mog1p-Gsp1p interaction was not completely disrupted by the E65K-Mog1p mutation in vivoor that Mog1p performs additional functions in the cell that do not involve its interaction with Gsp1p. Mog1p levels in wild-type andE65K-Mog1 cells were comparable, confirming that the growth phenotype observed for E65K-Mog1 was not due to a decreased level of E65K-Mog1p (data not shown). Since Gsp1p-GDP binding by Mog1p and Ntf2p is mutually exclusive, the two proteins may have a common or at least overlapping binding site on Ran (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The NTF2-Ran interaction is mediated by residues in the switch I and II loops of Ran (14Kent H.M. Moore M.S. Quimby B.B. Baker A.M. McCoy A.J. Murphy G.A. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Murphy G.A. Moore M.S. Drivas G. Perez de la Ossa P. Villamarin A. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2591-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Stewart M. Kent H.M. McCoy A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the regions of Ras family GTPases that change conformation in response to nucleotide state (33Geyer M. Wittinghofer A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 786-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,34Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 849-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine if the same residues were involved in the Mog1-Ran interaction, we tested the Ran switch I mutant T42A and switch II mutants Q69L, F72W, and R76E for binding to His-tagged human Mog1. Consistent with the yeast Mog1p binding assays (see Fig.1B), the amount of Ran-GDP bound to human Mog1 was lower than observed with Ran-GTP (Fig.4A). Importantly, the Ran switch loop mutants in both nucleotide states displayed wild-type levels of binding to Mog1, with the possible exception of Q69L-GDP, which showed a slightly lower level of binding (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the NTF2 control displayed significantly reduced binding to the switch II mutants Q69L, F72W, and R76E compared with wild-type Ran-GDP (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the switch loops do not play a major role in the formation of a Mog1-Ran complex. To obtain Ran mutants with decreased affinity for Mog1, we performed a mutagenesis screen to identify charged surface residues on Gsp1p that are important for the interaction with Mog1p. Gsp1p mutants (R97E, K101E, R108E, R112E, E115K, K129E, E130K, R131E, K132E, K134E, and K136E) were assayed for binding to Mog1p-Sepharose and, as a control, to Ntf2p-Sepharose. Mutation of Lys136, which is located ∼25–30 Å away from the switch loop region of Ran (Fig.4B) reduced Mog1p binding without decreasing the interaction with Ntf2p (see below). Mutations at two other residues, Arg108 and Arg112, close to the NTF2-binding site on Ran (Fig. 4B) disrupted Ntf2p binding without reducing Mog1p binding (data not shown). Mog1p was assayed for its ability to interact with His-tagged K136E-Gsp1p in either nucleotide state. Compared with wild-type Gsp1p, only a weak residual interaction with K136E-Gsp1p was observed for wild-type Mog1p (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–2 and7–8). A similar low level of binding to K136E-Gsp1p was detected for the D62K-Mog1p and E65K-Mog1p mutants, even when present in 5-fold excess over the level of wild-type Mog1p (Fig. 5A, lanes 3–4 and 9–10). In contrast, neither Ntf2p nor Kap95p binding to K136E-Gsp1p was decreased compared with wild-type Gsp1p (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–6 and11–12) indicating that the K136E mutation did not introduce a major conformational change. The effect of the K136E substitution on the strength of the Mog1-Ran interaction in yeast was also examined. Unlike wild-type Gsp1p, which co-purified with GST-tagged Mog1p, we were unable to detect any K136E-Gsp1p associated with GST-tagged Mog1p (Fig. 5B). To analyze the function of K136E-Gsp1p in vivo, we expressed this mutant as the only source of Gsp1p in yeast. The growth of wild-type, Δmog1, and K136E-Gsp1 cells was monitored by A600 (Fig. 5C). This analysis showed that K136E-Gsp1 cells were viable, indicating that K136E-Gsp1p can functionally replace wild-type Gsp1p. However, the growth of K136E-Gsp1 was slower than wild-type cells and similar to Δmog1 cells (Fig. 5C), consistent with a loss of the Mog1p-Gsp1p interaction. Expression levels of K136E-Gsp1p were comparable to those for wild-type Gsp1p, indicating that the phenotype observed was not due to decreased expression of the mutant protein (data not shown). Cells lacking Mog1p show defects in nuclear protein import (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To determine if the E65K-Mog1p and K136E-Gsp1p mutations cause protein import defects, we utilized a NLS-GAL4AD-GFP reporter protein (29Shulga N. Roberts P. Gu Z. Spitz L. Tabb M.M. Nomura M. Goldfarb D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, the NLS-GFP reporter protein was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 6) whereas inΔmog1 cells it was mislocalized to the cytoplasm, consistent with a previous report (9Oki M. Nishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15388-15393Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both E65K-Mog1 andK136E-Gsp1 cells also displayed defects in nuclear protein import (Fig. 6). The cytoplasmic mislocalization of the NLS-GFP reporter protein was more pronounced for K136E-Gsp1 than forΔmog1 and E65K-Mog1 (Fig. 6), which may indicate that other functions of Gsp1p, in addition to Mog1p binding, were affected by the K136E-Gsp1p mutation. Mog1p binds tightly to the nucleotide-free form of Gsp1p (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Oki M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32894-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The only other protein that binds to the nucleotide-free form of Ran is the RanGEF, RCC1 (2Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) in vertebrates or Prp20p (35Fleischmann M. Clark M.W. Forrester W. Wickens M. Nishimoto T. Aebi M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 227: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in yeast. As a genetic test for functional overlap between MOG1 and PRP20, we tested for any synthetic growth defects in a double mutant. SincePRP20 is essential, we used a well characterized temperature-sensitive allele, prp20-1 (36Aebi M. Clark M.W. Vijayraghavan U. Abelson J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 37Hayashi N. Seino H. Irie K. Watanabe M. Clark K.L. Matsumoto K. Nishimoto T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which shows reduced binding to Gsp1p (38Akhtar N. Hagan H. Lopilato J. Corbett A.H. Mol. Genet. 2001; 265: 851-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleotide exchange by this mutant protein is also reduced. If Mog1p is involved in modulating the nucleotide state of Gsp1p within the nucleus, as has been demonstrated for the mammalian exchange factor, RCC1 (2Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Nature. 1991; 354: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 3Nemergut M.E. Mizzen C.A. Stukenberg T. Allis C.D. Macara I.G. Science. 2001; 292: 1540-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), cells with mutations in both MOG1 and PRP20 might be more growth compromised than either of the single mutants. We therefore deleted MOG1 in the prp20-1 mutant to generate the prp20-1Δmog1 double mutant. Theprp20-1Δmog1 double mutant was unable to grow under conditions that supported the growth of each single mutant (Fig.7), demonstrating a genetic interaction between MOG1 and PRP20. The Ran-binding protein, Mog1, has emerged as a novel factor involved in regulating the nucleotide state of Ran. Previous reports showed that Mog1 is a guanine nucleotide release factor for Ran-GTP (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Oki M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32894-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and we have demonstrated that Mog1 also stimulates the release of nucleotide from Ran-GDP. Thus, an interaction between Mog1 and either nucleotide state of Ran results in nucleotide release and formation of a stable complex between Mog1 and nucleotide-free Ran. The RanGEF, RCC1, can also catalyze nucleotide release from either nucleotide state of Ran (30Klebe C. Prinz H. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12543-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) but unlike RCC1, Mog1 does not promote rebinding of nucleotide (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mog1 binding may cause Ran to adopt a unique conformation that releases the nucleotide and stabilizes the molecule in this nucleotide-free state. We have used structure-based mutagenesis of Mog1 and Ran to identify residues required for formation of this complex and to assess the importance of the Mog1-Ran interaction in vivo. From the crystal structure of S. cerevisiae Mog1p, we predicted that a highly conserved cluster of surface residues might constitute a binding site for Ran. Mutagenesis of this conserved surface patch revealed that residues Asp62 and Glu65 are important for the Mog1-Ran interaction. Replacement of wild-type Mog1p in yeast with the E65K-Mog1p mutant caused temperature-sensitive growth and defects in nuclear protein import, similar to the phenotype observed for Δmog1 cells. These results suggest that a primary function of Mog1p in the cell relies on its ability to bind Ran. The switch loops of Ran (involved in the NTF2-Ran interaction) were possible candidates for a Mog1-binding site because Mog1p and Ntf2p cannot bind Gsp1p simultaneously (10Stewart M. Baker R.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, several switch I and II loop mutants retained the ability to bind Mog1, suggesting that this region of Ran is not involved directly in the interaction with Mog1. Although reduced binding to Mog1 was previously reported for the switch II mutant, Q69L-Ran-GTP (11Steggerda S.M. Paschal B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23175-23180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we found that Mog1 had a wild-type level of affinity for Q69L-Ran-GTP. Because the Q69L-Ran mutant is prone to denaturation, we always carried out our assays using freshly prepared protein. In a mutagenesis screen of Gsp1p charged surface residues, we observed reduced Mog1p binding to the K136E-Gsp1p mutant. The conformation of Gsp1p was not likely to have been perturbed by this mutation because wild-type levels of binding to both Ntf2p and Kap95p were observed for K136E-Gsp1p. Like Δmog1 andE65K-Mog1, the K136E-Gsp1 mutant showed protein import defects, consistent with Lys136 being involved in the Mog1-Ran interaction. These observations support the hypothesis that the Mog1-Ran interaction is required for efficient nuclear protein import. Lys136 in Gsp1p corresponds to Lys134 in vertebrate Ran, which is located on helix α4 in the Ran-GDP structure (39Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because the COOH-terminal helix α6 is juxtaposed against helix α4 (Fig. 4B), Mog1 would likely have to displace the COOH-terminal helix to bind and release nucleotide from Ran-GDP. This might explain the higher affinity of Mog1 for Ran-GTP compared with Ran-GDP, since the COOH-terminal helix is already displaced from this region in Ran-GTP (40Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 41Chook Y.M. Blobel G.

Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of the COOH-terminal DEDDDL motif, which stabilizes the conformation of helix α6 in Ran-GDP (40Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), increases the affinity of Mog1 for Ran (13Oki M. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32894-32900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Ran-DEDDDL motif also stimulates the formation of complexes between importin-β and Ran (43Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Villa Braslavsky C.I. Nowak C. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Kuhlmann J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11629-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and between RCC1 and Ran (45Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since both importin-β and RCC1 make contacts with Lys134 and other residues in the helix α4 region of Ran (41Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Nature. 1999; 399: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 42Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Gorlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 46Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the binding sites for importin-β and RCC1 on Ran partially overlap with the putative Mog1-binding site. Overlapping binding sites for Mog1 and importin-β on Ran would explain our inability to detect a trimeric complex between Mog1, Ran, and importin-β. 2R. P. Baker and M. Stewart, unpublished observations. Although the Mog1- and NTF2-binding sites on Ran do not appear to overlap, simultaneous binding is likely prevented because the two molecules bind different conformational states of Ran. NTF2 binds Ran in the GDP-bound state in which the COOH-terminal helix is stabilized against the core of the molecule, whereas NTF2 is prevented from binding Ran-GTP by a steric clash with the COOH-terminal linker in its displaced conformation (40Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Conversely, our model suggests that Mog1 binding to Ran requires displacement of the COOH terminus, which may explain why Mog1 and NTF2 binding to Ran is mutually exclusive. The putative Mog1-binding site in the Lys134 region is adjacent to a loop containing residues Lys123 and Asp125 which are part of the highly conserved NKxD nucleotide-binding motif (Fig. 4B). These residues interact with the guanine base in both nucleotide states of Ran (39Scheffzek K. Klebe C. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 374: 378-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 40Vetter I.R. Nowak C. Nishimoto T. Kuhlmann J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1999; 398: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, Mog1 binding to helix α4 may induce a conformational change in this loop that disrupts binding of Lys123 and Asp125 to the guanine base promoting nucleotide release from Ran-GDP or Ran-GTP. Like Mog1, RCC1 also interacts with Ran residues in helix α4 and large conformational changes are observed for helix α4 and the NKxD base-binding motif of Ran in the RCC1-Ran structure (46Renault L. Kuhlmann J. Henkel A. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 2001; 105: 245-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In summary, we have defined residues on Mog1 and Ran important for their interaction in vitro and in vivo and have demonstrated the importance of the Mog1-Ran interaction in nuclear protein import. We have also shown that Mog1 binds and stimulates nucleotide release from both Ran-GDP and Ran-GTP in vitro, suggesting that the function of Mog1 in nuclear protein import may involve its modulation of the nucleotide state of Ran. The genetic interaction we detected between MOG1 and PRP20, the yeast RanGEF, raises the possibility that these two proteins may act synergistically to generate Ran-GTP in the nucleus.

The well ordered intracellular space of the cell is separated from the chaotic extracellular world by a lipid bilayer membrane. An important process for information transfer across the lipid bilayer is the G protein signal transduction system (1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), out of which one of the most well studied is the activation of the mating process of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this process, small peptide pheromones produced by one type of cell are recognized by the opposite mating type, and this recognition initiates a series of events which includes cell cycle arrest, modulation of transcription, and changes in the cellular morphology (for review, see Ref. 2Leberer E. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar and references therein). The transmission of the mating signal requires a protein Ste20p to link the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein to the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (3Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Ste20p is a member of the Ste20/PAK family of serine/threonine protein kinases which have sequence similarity to protein kinase C and which are highly conserved from yeast to man and responsible for integrating multiple cellular signals (3Leberer E. Dignard D. Harcus D. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 4Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, Ste20p is involved in many important cellular processes, including pheromone signaling, morphological switching, vegetative growth, and polarized morphogenesis. Through binding interaction with the upstream Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein, Ste20p activates the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade and ultimately regulates the Ste12p transcription factor (5Dolan J.W. Kirkman C. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5703-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Ste20p of the yeast S. cerevisiae is a 939-residue protein kinase, consisting of an N-terminal regulatory region over residues 1–627, a C-terminal kinase domain, and a noncatalytic domain at the extreme C terminus (Fig. 1). Several sites have been identified within residues 1–627 of Ste20p with binding activities for Ste5 (6Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 83-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, the binding site of Ste20p to the Gβ subunit was mapped to within the noncatalytic C-terminal domain of Ste20p and more specifically to a 14-residue fragment with a micromolar affinity (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Gβ binding (GBB)1 sequence of Ste20p has been shown to represent a novel docking site for the heterotrimeric G protein, with a consensus sequence of SSLφPLI/VXφφβ (X for any residue; φ for A, I, L, S, or T; β for basic residues) present only in members of the Ste20p/PAK protein kinase family (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In particular, the isolated C-terminal domain of Ste20p can completely restore the GBB function of the full-length Ste20p as shown by in vitro binding assays (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This observation indicates that the C-terminal domain of Ste20p is capable of binding Gβ independent of the other parts of Ste20p (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Here, we report a NMR characterization of the conformational properties of the GBB domain of Ste20p to provide a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the Ste20p-Gβ interaction. We studied two peptide fragments containing the GBB consensus, namely a 14-residue minimal fragment (Fig. 1B) and a 37-residue extended peptide (Fig. 1C). We also succeeded in labeling the entire 86-residue C-terminal domain of Ste20p (Fig.1D) with the 15N or15N/13C isotopes for studies by use of heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Our extensive NMR analyses indicate that the GBB domain of Ste20p, although fully functional, is not uniquely structured and assumes only flexibly linked secondary structure elements. A 14-residue peptide Ste20877–890 corresponding to residues 877–890 of Ste20p and a 37-residue peptide Ste20859–895were chemically synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center of McGill University (Montreal, PQ). The synthetic peptides were purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography and their identities verified by electrospray mass spectrometry. A polymerase chain reaction was performed on a plasmid containing the Ste20p gene of the yeast S. cerevisiae, using 5′-CGCGGATCCGTGGAGCCCGAAGAT-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCTACCCTGCTTGCTAC-3′ as primers. The amplified DNA fragment encoding residues 854–939 (designated as Ste20854–939) was cloned into the pGEX expression vector as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites. The sequence of the cloned DNA was confirmed by the automated DNA sequencing procedure. The cloned expression vector was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) to overexpress the GST-Ste20854–939 fusion protein, which was subsequently purified using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cleavage of the GST-Ste20854–939protein was performed directly on the glutathione-Sepharose column. The released Ste20854–939 protein was purified further on a fast performance liquid chromatography system using a Superdex G-75 column. For NMR experiments, the Ste20854–939 protein was prepared in 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled forms using a similar expression protocol except for growing E. coli cells in M9 medium instead of the 2YT medium. The (15NH4)2SO4 salt was used for 15N labeling and (15NH4)2SO4/13C-glucose used for 15N/13C labeling. The N-terminal 7 residues of the expressed Ste20854–939 protein samples were confirmed through sequencing and molecular masses verified by mass spectrometry. Deuterated dithiothreitol was included in the purified protein solution at a final concentration of 5 mm in order to prevent the formation of an intermolecular disulfide.d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone and a mixture of protease inhibitors were also added to inhibit the activities of any residual thrombin and other proteases not removed by the purification procedure. Samples for NMR experiments were prepared by dissolving the lyophilized peptides or the expressed protein in 400 µl of aqueous buffer composed of 50 mmsodium phosphate and 0.2 mm EDTA. The pH values of the NMR samples were 6.8 for the two peptides and 5.5 for the entire domain because of a slight precipitation for the expressed protein at near neutral pH values. The deuterium lock signal for the NMR spectrometers was provided by the addition of 50 µl of D2O. Deuterated trifluoroethanol (TFE) was used to prepare NMR samples in the presence of 40% TFE. Proton NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker Avance-500 or Avance-800 spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance pulse field gradient accessories. Phase-sensitive detection by time-proportional phase incrementation was employed for both the two-dimensional Overhauser effect NOESY (12Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 4546-4553Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) and total correlation TOCSY (13Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) experiments. Mixing times of 150 and 200 ms were used for NOESY experiments and a mixing time of 65 ms for TOCSY experiments. Spectral processing was carried out using the XwinNMR spectrometer software (Bruker). A set of three-dimensional heteronuclear experiments, including HNCA, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, TOCSY-HSQC, and NOESY-HSQC (14Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1399) Google Scholar and references therein) were collected for the isotope-labeled Ste20854–939 protein at 288 K on the 800 MHz spectrometer. Water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE method (15Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) with a 3:9:19 binomial selective pulse (16Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) incorporated into the last t2 periods of all of the three-dimensional pulse sequences as described previously (17Talluri S. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1996; 112: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To improve the sensitivity and water suppression, a SEDUCE-1 (18Mueller L. McCoy M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2108-2112Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar) sequence with a field of 2.5 kHz for13C was used to decouple the13CO-15N interactions in the t1 and t2 evolution periods. The NMR data were processed using NMRPipe/NMRDraw with 90°-shifted sine-square weighting functions in all three dimensions (19Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfiefer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and analyzed by the use of NMRView (20Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). All chemical shifts were indirectly referenced to that of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (21Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Sequence-specific assignments of the proton resonances for the two peptides were achieved through identification of spin systems in the TOCSY spectra combined with sequential NOE connectivities in the NOESY spectra (22Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley and Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The amide 1H, 15N,13Cα, and 13Cβ resonances of Ste20854–939 were assigned using the three heteronuclear spectra, namely 15N HSQC, HNCACB, and CBCA(CO)NH. This process provided assignments for the backbone resonances of most residues except for an acidic segment over residues 905–913 with a sequence of DNDDDNDNE where the Asp and Asn residues occur repeatedly causing severe spectral overlaps. 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and1H-15N steady-state NOEs were determined on the 800 Hz spectrometer from a series of two-dimensional1H-15N correlation spectra as described by Farrow et al. (23Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). 15N T1 values were measured from spectra recorded with relaxation delays of 40, 90, 140, 200, 280, 380, 500, 650, 830, 1,050, and 1,250 ms. 15N T2 values were determined with relaxation delays of 14.4, 28.8, 57.6, 86.4, 115.2, 144, 172.8, 216, 259.2, 316.8, 374.4, and 460.8 ms.1H-15N steady-state NOEs were obtained by recording spectra with and without 1H presaturation of duration 3 s plus a relaxation delay of 2 s. T1 and T2 relaxation rate constants were determined by nonlinear least squares fits of the cross-peak intensities in the T1 and T2 experiments, assuming a single exponential decay. 1H-15N NOE values were obtained from the ratio of intensities of cross-peaks in the reference (no proton saturation) and NOE (with proton saturation) spectra. The presence of µs-ms scale conformational exchange processes was assessed by CPMG-based NMR experiments using procedures described previously (24Millet J.O. Loria P. Kroenke C.D. Pons M. Palmer III, A.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 112: 2867-2877Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 25Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, intensities of the1H-15N HSQC spectral peaks were followed as a function of the number of 180-degree 15N refocusing pulses (from 4 to 48) inserted within a constant period of 40 ms for the decay of the 15N transverse magnetizations (25Mulder F.A.A. Skrynnikov N.R. Hon B. Dahlquist F.W. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 967-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The HSQC intensities were converted to effective T2 values of the15N nuclei as a function of the repetition rates (or effective B1 field strengths) of the CPMG pulse train, which varied from 100 to 1,200 S−1 for the different number of refocusing pulses used. The hydrodynamic radius was determined by use of NMR pulsed field gradient measurements using the acetate ion as the internal reference (26Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). NOE cross-peaks were collected from the NOESY spectra and were classified roughly as strong, medium, or weak, corresponding to distance upper bounds of 3, 4.0, and 5.0 Å. The obtained distance constraints were employed to calculate the solution structure of the 37-residue peptide by use of a standard protocol of distance geometry followed by simulated annealing, or DG/SA, implemented in the XPLOR software program (27Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1.: A System for X-Ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). A set of 50 initial structures was generated by DG/SA, and 10 lowest-energy structures were selected for the final analysis and display. The protein structures are visualized and manipulated by use of the Sybyl molecular graphic program (Tripos Inc.) and the Insight II software package. Fig.2presents the conformational shifts of the 14-residue peptide Ste20877–890. Except for the C-terminal residue Leu890, the conformational shifts for all other residues are less than 0.05 ppm. This result, together with a poor chemical shift dispersion of the amide protons (∼0.62 ppm) and the absences of medium or long range NOEs over the entire sequence (data not shown), indicates that the 14-residue peptide is flexible and may assume a predominantly random coil conformation in aqueous solution. Secondary structure predictions using three different methods (28Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar, 29Levin J.M. Robson B. Garnier J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 30Gibrat J.F. Garnier J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 425-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) all suggest that the C-terminal domain of Ste20p has helical structure propensities over most residues (not shown). It is well known that TFE can significantly stabilize helical conformations for peptides and proteins with intrinsic helical propensities (31Dyson H.J. Rance M. Houghten R.A. Wright P.E. Lerner R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 201: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 32Segawa S. Fukuno T. Fujiwara K. Noda Y. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Buck M. Schwalbe H. Dobson C.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13219-13232Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, the conformation of the 14-residue peptide was studied further in the presence of 40% TFE. As seen in Fig. 2, the introduction of 40% TFE significantly induces the conformational shifts of the CαH protons toward helical values. In agreement with this, strong sequential NH-NH NOEs were also observed over residues Val885 to Leu890 in the presence of 40% TFE (spectra not shown). Very interestingly, even in the presence of TFE, the region around the two important binding residues, Ser879 and Ser880 (11Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), still remains predominantly flexible, as evident from the small CαH conformational shifts (Fig. 2) and the NOE patterns (data not shown). The 14-residue peptide Ste20877–890 has a relatively weak binding affinity for the Gβ protein (7Leberer E. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Leeuw T. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 11Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and is flexible conformationally in aqueous solution as shown above. Therefore, we extended this 14-residue sequence to a 37-residue peptide Ste20859–895 (Fig. 1C). Fig.3a presents the CαH conformational shifts for this peptide. It appears that the longer peptide shows enhanced helical preferences for many residues even in aqueous solution, with helical conformational shifts for many residues larger than 0.05 ppm. However, the increase in the helical propensities is still not significant because only three nontail residues, Thr863, Thr872, and Val885, show conformational shifts larger than 0.1 ppm but less than 0.15 ppm. The analysis of the NOESY spectra for this peptide identified sequential NH-NH NOEs over many residues (data not shown), indicating the existence of helical conformations to some degree. On the other hand, introduction of 40% TFE appears to stabilize the helical conformation of the longer peptide, Ste20859–895, significantly. The deviations of the CαH chemical shifts increase significantly toward the helical direction (Fig. 3a). Consistent with this observation, a large number of medium range NOEs were identified as shown in Fig. 3b. In the presence of 40% TFE, strong sequential NH-NH NOEs span over nearly the entire sequence, from residue Ala862 to Glu895. A close inspection of the CαH conformational shifts (Fig. 3a) and the NOE pattern (Fig. 3b) indicates that in the presence of 40% TFE, two helical segments form in the 37-residue peptide, one from Ala862 to Glu876 and another from Ala882 to Leu890. Very strikingly, the binding region around residues Ser879 and Ser880 is still located at the junction between the two helical segments and may remain flexible even in the presence of 40% TFE, in agreement with the results for the 14-residue peptide. The NMR data presented above showed that the 14- and 37-residue peptides containing the GBB consensus are unstructured in aqueous solution and only have helical secondary structure preferences. The lack of unique structures for the two peptides may be a result of missing long range interactions existing in the entire C-terminal domain of Ste20p. Therefore, the C-terminal domain over residues 853–939 of Ste20p was overexpressed and purified to homogeneity (Fig.4) by affinity chromatography and gel filtration fast performance liquid chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). A quick inspection of the1H-15N HSQC of Ste20853–939 showed that the chemical shift dispersions of both the amide1H and 15N dimensions were still very poor, only 0.85 ppm for amide proton and 15 ppm for 15N, suggesting that the Ste20853–939 may also be unfolded in solution. Resonance assignments of unfolded/partially folded proteins are usually difficult because of chemical shift degeneracies and/or broadening of resonances resulting from the intermediate rates of conformational exchange at µs-ms time scales (34Wüthrich K. EXS. 1994; 71: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments for resonance assignments, particularly by use of a combination of the HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH spectra. Some of the assignments were confirmed further by use of 15N-edited three-dimensional HSQC-TOCSY and HSQC-NOESY spectra. Using this procedure, most residues were assigned (Fig. 5a) with the exception of Ser879 and the Asp902-Asn-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asn-Asp-Asn-Glu910region because of resonance overlaps. The missing of the Ser879 peak may result from chemical shift degeneracies and/or broadening of resonances.Figure 5Panel a, an1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the entire C-terminal domain uniformly labeled with 15N and 13C at pH 5.5 and 15 °C with the assigned residues labeled.

Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5490-5492Crossref Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 36Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 37Constantine K.L. Mueller L. Goldfarb V. Wittekind M. Metzler W.J. Yanchunas Jr., J. Robertson J.G. Malley M.F. Friedrichs M.S. Farmer B.T., II J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 1223-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Overall, the C-terminal domain of Ste20p has helical preferences over most residues (Fig. 5b). A detailed examination suggests that the C-terminal domain may consist of several helical segments, the first one centered around Leu865-Leu866, the second around Leu884-Val885, and the third around Thr915. It is extremely interesting to note again that in the entire C-terminal domain, the region containing the important binding residues Ser879-Ser880 is located at the junction between the first and the second helical segments as constantly observed in the 14- and 37-residue peptides. As seen in Fig.5b, the chemical shift deviations suggest that the helical conformations are populated in the C-terminal domain but may still not be well formed. The analysis of the HSQC-NOESY spectrum indicates the absence of medium and long range NOEs for the entire C-terminal domain, confirming that the C-terminal domain indeed only has flexibly linked helical conformations and lacks tertiary packing interactions among the secondary structure elements. We also introduced TFE into the Ste20853–939 sample for further enhancement of the helical structures. At low concentrations of TFE (5–10%), no significant changes were observed as judged by one-dimensional NMR spectra (not shown). Introduction of 40% TFE as done for the two shorter peptides led to significant broadening of the NMR peaks and prevented us from a complete NMR and NOE analysis. With a small portion of residues assigned, it appears that 40% TFE may induce increases in helical preferences for many residues, as judged from the assigned Cα chemical shifts. For example, the Cα conformational shift for Ile874 increases from 0.24 to 0.61 ppm, Lys892 from 0.26 to 0.46 ppm, Val893 from 0.41 to 0.98 ppm, Thr915 from 0.02 to 0.52 ppm, Ser924 from 0.45 to 1.03 ppm, and Lys925 from 0.9 to 1.28 ppm. The 15N NMR relaxation data provide important insights into the conformational flexibility of protein backbones (38Grasberger B.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Bai Y. Chung J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1056-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Fig. 6presents the backbone 15N NMR relaxation data including1H-15N NOE intensities, T1 and T2 relaxation rates of the GBB domain. As seen in Fig. 6a, all of the1H-15N heteronuclear NOE intensities are less than 0.42, and most are even less than 0.30, which are far smaller than the suggested value of 0.8 for a well folded proteins (38Grasberger B.L. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 364-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This result clearly shows that the isolated C-terminal domain of Ste20p is conformationally flexible in solution. However, a closer examination of the heteronuclear NOE intensities indicates that several sequence segments may exhibit restricted motions to some degree, in agreement with the observation based on carbon chemical shifts (Fig.5b) that these segments have helical secondary structure preferences. Interestingly, the region around residues Ser879 and Ser880 gives rise to relatively weak heteronuclear NOEs, indicating that this sequence segment is more flex"
