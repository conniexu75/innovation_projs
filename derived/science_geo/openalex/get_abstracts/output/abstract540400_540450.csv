https://openalex.org/W2118238343,"Nicotine exposure has been associated with an increased likelihood of developing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in offspring of mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The goal of this study was to determine if exposure to E-cigarette nicotine vapors during late prenatal and early postnatal life altered behavior in adult mice. Methods Timed-pregnant C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 2.4% nicotine in propylene glycol (PG) or 0% nicotine /PG once a day from gestational day 15 until delivery. After delivery, offspring and mothers were exposed to E-cigarette vapors for an additional 14 days from postnatal day 2 through 16. Following their last exposure serum cotinine levels were measured in female juvenile mice. Male mice underwent behavioral testing at 14 weeks of age to assess sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive functional domains. Results Adult male mice exposed to 2.4% nicotine/PG E-cigarette vapors had significantly more head dips in the zero maze test and higher levels of rearing activity in the open field test compared to 0% nicotine/PG exposed mice and untreated controls. In the water maze test after reversal training, the 2.4% nicotine/PG mice spent more than 25% of time in the new location whereas the other groups did not. Conclusion Adult male mice exhibited increased levels of activity in the zero maze and open field tests when exposed to E-cigarette vapor containing nicotine during late prenatal and early postnatal life. These findings indicate that nicotine exposure from E-cigarettes may cause persistent behavioral changes when exposure occurs during a period of rapid brain growth."

Inversely, the effects of the microbiota on iron homeostasis have been little studied. So, we investigate whether the microbiota itself may alter host iron sensing. Duodenal cytochrome b and divalent metal transporter 1, involved in apical iron uptake, are 8- and 10-fold, respectively, more abundant in the duodenum of germ-free (GF) mice than in mice colonized with a microbiota. In contrast, the luminal exporter ferroportin is 2-fold less abundant in GF. The overall signature of microbiota on iron-related proteins is similar in the colon. The colonization does not modify systemic parameters as plasma transferrin saturation (20%), plasma ferritin (150 ng/L), and liver (85 µg/g) iron load. Commensal organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165) and a probiotic strain (Streptococcus thermophilus LMD-9) led to up to 12-fold induction of ferritin in colon. Our data suggest that the intestinal cells of GF mice are depleted of iron and that following colonization, the epithelial cells favor iron storage. This study is the first to demonstrate that gut microbes induce a specific iron-related protein signature, highlighting new aspects of the crosstalk between the microbiota and the intestinal epithelium."

In the present study we determine the prevalence of intestinal parasites and explore its association with anemia and stunting in school-aged children.A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to October 2010 enrolling 328 children attending the primary school in Lubango, the second largest city after the capital Luanda. Stool samples were collected for parasite detection through microscopy and molecular identification of Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar. Stunting was assessed using the z-scores of height for age and hemoglobin concentration was determined using a portable hemoglobin analyzing system.The global prevalence of pathogenic intestinal parasites was 44.2%, the most common being Ascaris lumbricoides (22.0%), Giardia lamblia (20.1%) and Hymenolepis nana (8.8%). Molecular detection revealed that 13.1% of the children carried E. dispar and 0.3% were infected with E. histolytica. The prevalence of stunting (mild to severe) was 41.5%. Stunting was more frequent in older children (p = 0.006, OR = 1.886), while anemia was more frequent in younger children (p = 0.005, OR = 2.210). The prevalence of anemia was 21.6%, and we found a significant association with infection by H. nana (p = 0.031, OR = 2.449).This is one of the few published studies reporting intestinal parasites infection, nutritional status and anemia in children from Angola. Furthermore, the present work highlights the importance of regular intestinal parasites screening in children."
https://openalex.org/W1917561073,"To better understand the mechanism of plastid differentiation from chloroplast to chromoplast, we examined proteome and plastid changes over four distinct developmental stages of 'Micro-Tom' fruit. Additionally, to discover more about the relationship between fruit color and plastid differentiation, we also analyzed and compared 'Micro-Tom' results with those from two other varieties, 'Black' and 'White Beauty'. We confirmed that proteins related to photosynthesis remain through the orange maturity stage of 'Micro-Tom', and also learned that thylakoids no longer exist at this stage. These results suggest that at a minimum there are changes in plastid morphology occurring before all related proteins change. We also compared 'Micro-Tom' fruits with 'Black' and 'White Beauty' using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. We found a decrease of CHRC (plastid-lipid-associated protein) and HrBP1 (harpin binding protein-1) in the 'Black' and 'White Beauty' varieties. CHRC is involved in carotenoid accumulation and stabilization. HrBP1 in Arabidopsis has a sequence similar to proteins in the PAP/fibrillin family. These proteins have characteristics and functions similar to lipocalin, an example of which is the transport of hydrophobic molecules. We detected spots of TIL (temperature-induced lipocalin) in 2D-PAGE results, however the number of spots and their isoelectric points differed between 'Micro-Tom' and 'Black'/'White Beauty'. Lipocalin has various functions including those related to environmental stress response, apoptosis induction, membrane formation and fixation, regulation of immune response, cell growth, and metabolism adjustment. Lipocalin related proteins such as TIL and HrBP1 could be related to the accumulation of carotenoids, fruit color and the differentiation of chromoplast."
https://openalex.org/W2271389813,"Protein kinase G (PKG) is a major receptor of cGMP and controls signaling pathways often distinct from those regulated by cAMP. Hence, the selective activation of PKG by cGMP versus cAMP is critical. However, the mechanism of cGMP-versus-cAMP selectivity is only limitedly understood. Although the C-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain B of PKG binds cGMP with higher affinity than cAMP, the intracellular concentrations of cAMP are typically higher than those of cGMP, suggesting that the cGMP-versus-cAMP selectivity of PKG is not controlled uniquely through affinities. Here, we show that cAMP is a partial agonist for PKG, and we elucidate the mechanism for cAMP partial agonism through the comparative NMR analysis of the apo, cGMP-, and cAMP-bound forms of the PKG cyclic nucleotide-binding domain B. We show that although cGMP activation is adequately explained by a two-state conformational selection model, the partial agonism of cAMP arises from the sampling of a third, partially autoinhibited state."
https://openalex.org/W2207611101,"The relation between rainfall and water accumulated in reservoirs comprises nonlinear feedbacks. Here we show that they may generate alternative equilibrium regimes, one of high water-volume, the other of low water-volume. Reservoirs can be seen as socio-environmental systems at risk of regime shifts, characteristic of tipping point transitions. We analyze data from stored water, rainfall, and water inflow and outflow in the main reservoir serving the metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil, by means of indicators of critical regime shifts, and find a strong signal of a transition. We furthermore build a mathematical model that gives a mechanistic view of the dynamics and demonstrates that alternative stable states are an expected property of water reservoirs. We also build a stochastic version of this model that fits well to the data. These results highlight the broader aspect that reservoir management must account for their intrinsic bistability, and should benefit from dynamical systems theory. Our case study illustrates the catastrophic consequences of failing to do so."
https://openalex.org/W2254825101,"Dehydration can be due to desiccation caused by a lack of environmental water or to freezing caused by a lack of liquid water. Plants have evolved a large family of proteins called LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins, which include the intrinsically disordered dehydrin (dehydration protein) family, to combat these abiotic stresses. Although transcription and translation studies have shown a correlation between dehydration stress and the presence of dehydrins, the biochemical mechanisms have remained somewhat elusive. We examine here the effect and structure of a small model dehydrin (Vitis riparia K2) on the protection of membranes from freeze-thaw stress. This protein is able to bind to liposomes containing phosphatidic acid and protect the liposomes from fusing after freeze-thaw treatment. The presence of K2 did not measurably affect liposome surface accessibility or lipid mobility but did lower its membrane transition temperature by 3 °C. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate as a membrane model, we examined the NMR structure of K2 in the presence and absence of the micelle. Biochemical and NMR experiments show that the conserved, lysine-rich segments are involved in the binding of the dehydrin to a membrane, whereas the poorly conserved φ segments play no role in binding or protection.

Water deficiency can be lethal because it leads to damage to DNA, membranes, and proteins, including an impairment of enzyme function. Many poikilothermic organisms express proteins that protect them from the detrimental effects of freezing and dehydration. In plants, this includes dehydrins (dehydration proteins) whose up-regulated transcription and translation has been associated with protection from several abiotic stresses, including drought, cold, and high salinity (for reviews on dehydrins, see Refs. 1Close T.J.

Disorder and function: a review of the dehydrin protein family.Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5: e576Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Dehydrins are a member of a large family of proteins, known as LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins (7Tunnacliffe A. Wise M.J.

LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins and their encoding genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 118Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Dehydrins themselves have been found in a number of different intracellular locations and are often found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Other locations include at the mitochondrial, chloroplast, and plasma membranes. The diverse localization may also be reflected in the diverse protective effects of dehydrin in the plant. These include preventing electrolyte leakage across cold-stressed membranes (10Ismail A.M. Hall A.E. Close T.J.

Zhang R. Qu Y. Miao Z. Zhang Y. Shen X. Wang T. Dong J. Overexpression of MtCAS31 enhances drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis by reducing stomatal density.New Phytol. 2012; 195: 124-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An examination of the dehydrin sequence reveals that they are modular in nature and contain a variable number of conserved sequence motifs. This modularity results in a range of dehydrin sizes (6–200 kDa). By definition, dehydrins must contain at least one K segment (1Close T.J. Dehydrins: emergence of a biochemical role of a family of plant dehydration proteins.Physiol. Plant. 1996; 97: 795-803Crossref Google Scholar). This 15-residue, Lys-rich motif (EKKGIMDKIKEKLPG) can be found in 1–11 copies in a single dehydrin sequence. The S segment, which consists of 5–7 Ser residues, is not present in all dehydrins. When present, it is normally present only once. The Y segment consists of the sequence motif (V/T)D(E/Q)YGNP and is usually present in one or two copies. Residues not found in one of these three motifs are said to be located in the φ segment. This segment is not conserved in terms of length but is rich in Gly and polar/charged amino acids such as Glu, Thr, Lys, and His (6Graether S.P. Boddington K.F. Disorder and function: a review of the dehydrin protein family.Front. Plant Sci. 2014; 5: e576Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The lack of hydrophobic residues explains the lack of tertiary structure in dehydrins. Dehydrins are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) 2The abbreviations used are: IDPintrinsically disordered proteinDPHdiphenylhexatrieneDMPC1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholinePCl-α-lyso-phosphatidylcholinePAl-α-phosphatidic acidPGl-α-phosphatidylglycerolPSl-α-lysophosphatidylserineTMA-DPHtrimethylammonium diphenylhexatrieneDSCdifferential scanning calorimetryDMPA1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphateHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherence.

The roles of the various conserved motifs are not yet fully clear. Dehydrins that contain multiple copies of the K segment tend to be more expressed during cold-stress, whereas the Y segment dehydrins tend to be correlated with desiccation and salt stress (5Eriksson S.K.

Zhang Z. Ma Z. Classification and expression diversification of wheat dehydrin genes.Plant Sci. 2014; 214: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In terms of localization within the cell, dehydrins containing K segments or K and S segments are found in the cytoplasm and at the membrane (17Houde M. Daniel C. Lachapelle M. Allard F. Laliberté S. Sarhan F. Immunolocalization of freezing-tolerance-associated proteins in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of wheat crown tissues.Plant J. 1995; 8: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), with the possibility that residues in and near the S segment are responsible for nuclear localization (18Goday A.

The maize abscisic acid-responsive protein Rab17 is located in the nucleus and interacts with nuclear localization signals.Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To better characterize the physiological role of dehydrins, a number of in vitro assays have been performed. One of the most extensively performed assays is the enzyme cryoprotection. The most commonly used enzyme is lactate dehydrogenase (19Carpenter J.F. Crowe J.H. The mechanism of cryoprotection of proteins by solutes.Cryobiology. 1988; 25: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 20Lin C. Thomashow M.F. A cold-regulated Arabidopsis gene encodes a polypeptide having potent cryoprotective activity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1103-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), although the starch degradation enzyme α-amylase has also been used (21Rinne P.L. Kaikuranta P.L. van der Plas LH van der Schoot C Dehydrins in cold-acclimated apices of birch (Betula pubescens ehrh.): production, localization and potential role in rescuing enzyme function during dehydration.Planta. 1999; 209: 377-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The repeated freezing and thawing of lactate dehydrogenase results in its loss of activity, most likely because of aggregation (22Hughes S. Graether S.P. Cryoprotective mechanism of a small intrinsically disordered dehydrin protein.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The addition of dehydrin results in the recovery of activity, with the longer the dehydrin the more efficient the recovery (23Hughes S.L. Schart V. Malcolmson J. Hogarth K.A. Martynowicz D.M. Tralman-Baker E. Patel S.N. Graether S.P. The importance of size and disorder in the cryoprotective effects of dehydrins.Plant Physiol. 2013; 163: 1376-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Dehydrins have been shown to bind metals, which may prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species. These proteins have also been found to bind DNA and RNA in a nonspecific manner (24Hara M. Shinoda Y. Tanaka Y. Kuboi T. DNA binding of citrus dehydrin promoted by zinc ion.Plant Cell Environ. 2009; 32: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which was postulated to help protect nucleic acids from desiccation damage. The localization studies showing that dehydrins can be located near the membrane (25Danyluk J. Perron A. Houde M. Limin A. Fowler B. Benhamou N. Sarhan F. Accumulation of an acidic dehydrin in the vicinity of the plasma membrane during cold acclimation of wheat.Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) prompted several studies to examine whether binding can occur in vitro, using both liposomes and micelles (5Eriksson S.K.

Many IDPs can gain structure upon binding to a ligand. The same is true for dehydrins, because CD studies showed that the protein became α-helical in the presence of SDS micelles and liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine and a second lipid (phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, or phosphatidylserine) that must be negatively charged (27Koag M.-C. Fenton R.D. Wilkens S. Close T.J.

Tompa P. Chaperone activity of ERD10 and ERD14, two disordered stress-related plant proteins.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Dehydrins have also been shown to interact with liposomes whose lipid composition mimics that of the plasma membrane (31Rahman L.N. Chen L. Nazim S. Bamm V.V. Yaish M.W. Moffatt B.A. Dutcher J.R. Harauz G. Interactions of intrinsically disordered Thellungiella salsuginea dehydrins TsDHN-1 and TsDHN-2 with membranes: synergistic effects of lipid composition and temperature on secondary structure.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 88: 791-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Deletion studies with the maize dehydrin ZmDHN1 showed that the K segments are likely responsible for binding to these different membranes, although which residues were responsible was not determined, nor if there is a weaker interaction with the φ segment (28Koag M.-C. Wilkens S. Fenton R.D. Resnik J. Vo E. Close T.J. The K-segment of maize DHN1 mediates binding to anionic phospholipid vesicles and concomitant structural changes.Plant Physiol. 2009; 150: 1503-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A need to closely examine the role of the φ segment is driven by a study of the Arabidopsis dehydrin Lti30, which is able to bind liposomes, whereas the K peptide (that is, a peptide consisting of only the 15-residue K segment) failed to bind (32Eriksson S.K. Kutzer M. Procek J. Gröbner G. Harryson P. Tunable membrane binding of the intrinsically disordered dehydrin Lti30, a cold-induced plant stress protein.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2391-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which dehydrins may protect the membrane from desiccation and cold stress also require further study. A study on the Arabidopsis dehydrins ERD10 and ERD14 used diphenylhexatriene (DPH) to examine the mobility of a membrane in the presence of these two dehydrins (30Kovacs D. Kalmar E. Torok Z. Tompa P. Chaperone activity of ERD10 and ERD14, two disordered stress-related plant proteins.Plant Physiol. 2008; 147: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). No effect was observed, but this may not be surprising because this probe partitions in the acyl chain region of the liposome, whereas the polar dehydrins are likely to interact at the liposome surface. The study using Arabidopsis Lti30 dehydrin also examined membrane fluidity by measuring the phase transition temperature of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC):1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine liposomes (32Eriksson S.K. Kutzer M. Procek J. Gröbner G. Harryson P. Tunable membrane binding of the intrinsically disordered dehydrin Lti30, a cold-induced plant stress protein.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2391-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The protein was able to lower the transition temperature of the liposomes, which would allow the plant to maintain membrane fluidity at lower temperatures (32Eriksson S.K. Kutzer M. Procek J. Gröbner G. Harryson P. Tunable membrane binding of the intrinsically disordered dehydrin Lti30, a cold-induced plant stress protein.Plant Cell. 2011; 23: 2391-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, this does not address the problem of how dehydrins could protect membranes at subzero temperatures. We examine here the ability of the minimal dehydrin K2 to protect liposomes from freeze-thaw and cold stress damage, what effect binding has on some membrane properties, and what effect binding has on K2 structure. We also see whether the gain in α-helicity is restricted to the K segments and whether the φ segments play any role in binding to the liposome. The Vitis riparia K2 protein was expressed and purified as described previously (15Livernois A.M. Hnatchuk D.J. Findlater E.E. Graether S.P.

Cell cultures were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 30 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 liter of modified M9 minimal with [13C]glucose (3 g) and/or [15N]NH4Cl (1 g) for protein labeling. The protein was extracted by boiling the resuspended pellet in water for 20 min; sodium acetate, pH 5.0 buffer was added to give a final buffer concentration of 20 mm. Purification by cation exchange and desalting by reversed phase HPLC was performed as previously described (22Hughes S. Graether S.P. Cryoprotective mechanism of a small intrinsically disordered dehydrin protein.Protein Sci. 2011; 20: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The protein was lyophilized to dryness and stored at −20 °C until use. K peptide was synthesized and purified as described previously (23Hughes S.L. Schart V. Malcolmson J. Hogarth K.A.

The lipids were dissolved in a 4:1 chloroform:methanol solution at a concentration of 100 mg/ml. To form a lipid cake, 12.5 μl of both PC and PA, PG, or PS were dispensed in the bottom of a glass vial, mixed, and subsequently dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. After 1 h of further evaporation of solvents under vacuum, the lipids were resuspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After five liquid nitrogen freeze-thaw cycles, the solution was extruded 21 times through a 100-nm polycarbonate membrane that had been warmed to 45 °C (33Olson F. Hunt C.A. Szoka F.C. Vail W.J.

Liposome size was confirmed using dynamic light scattering (described below), and preparations were used for experiments within 4 days. For the fusion assays, liposome solutions were diluted to a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with and without K2, lysozyme (egg white, white crystalline, ∼100% pure; Fisher Scientific), or PEG 3350 (≥99.95% pure, Mr 3,000–3,700; Sigma-Aldrich). Samples (100 μl) were chilled to −20 °C in an enzyme cooler box for ∼2 min. To nucleate the flash-freeze process, the base of each tube was then firmly pressed against a metal spatula that had been chilled by liquid nitrogen. Once frozen, tubes were stored at −20 °C for 12–16 h. Tubes were then thawed at room temperature, and 400 μl of buffer was added before size measurement by dynamic light scattering. Size distributions for liposomes were measured using a ZetaSizer Nano S (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK). Analysis was done in the Malvern Dispersion Technology software suite, version 3.3, using the default settings. Measurements were made at 25 °C, and the data were analyzed using the discrete peak calculation method with polystyrene latex as the reference standard. Surface accessibilities in the presence of K2, lysozyme, and PEG 3350 were assessed using the dye merocyanine 540 (34Bakaltcheva I. Williams W.P. Schmitt J.M. Hincha D.K. The solute permeability of thylakoid membranes is reduced by low concentrations of trehalose as a co-solute.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1189: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Liposomes (0.3 mg/ml) were prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. K2, lysozyme, or PEG 3350 were added to the liposome containing solutions, and samples were equilibrated for 30 min. A stock solution of merocyanine 540 was added to a final concentration of 4 μm, and the samples were allowed to equilibrate for an additional 30 min. The absorbance ratio (570 nm/540 nm) was measured using a Cary 100 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies) and corrected for absorbance at 570 and 540 nm in the absence of the fluorescent dye. For the lipid mobility experiments (35Lentz B.R. Use of fluorescent probes to monitor molecular order and motions within liposome bilayers.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1993; 64: 99-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), liposomes were constituted in the usual manner, with DPH or trimethylammonium diphenylhexatriene (TMA-DPH) added to the lipid mixture in the first step to produce a lipid:probe molar ratio of 200:1. The probed lipid cake was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and extruded as described previously. Lipids were diluted to experimental concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml for measurement in a PTI QuantaMaster C-61 steady-state fluorometer with an electronic polarized excitation filter and two manual emission polarizing filters (Photon Technology International, London, Canada). The G-factor was obtained first for each sample using the equation, G=IHVIHH(Eq. 1) where IVH and IHH are the intensities of the vertical and horizontal excited light, respectively, with the emission polarizer set in the horizontal position. The emission polarizer was then set in a vertical position, and the measurements were repeated. Anisotropy (r) was calculated by the equation, r=Ivv−G·IVHIw+2G·IVH(Eq. 2) where IVV is the intensity of the vertical excited light with the emission polarizer set in the vertical position. The transition temperature (Tm) of the PC:PA liposomes was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Liposomes consisting of a 1:1 (w:w) ratio of DMPC to 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DMPA) were prepared as described above except the extrusion process was performed at 55 °C to maintain fluid lipids. K2 dehydrin, lysozyme, or PEG 3350 were added at a concentration of 75 μm to liposomes at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The mixtures were allowed to incubate for 30 min before being degassed for 15 min. Measurements were made on a MicroCal VP differential scanning calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). To account for the heat capacity of the buffer alone, the buffer was scanned against a water reference. DSC measurements were performed with up-scans at a rate of 45 °C/h, using a 5-s filtering period and a 15-min prescan equilibrium and with high gain feedback mode enabled. High gain feedback was used because of the relatively low signal intensity observed at these lipid concentrations. Because the noise was generated in this mode, the filtering period was set to 5 s to provide a more reliable signal. To account for the “thermal history” of a sample, 15 scans were performed, with only the final scan kept for analysis. The binding of K2 to liposomes was assessed by separating bound and unbound protein by centrifugation (36Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Membrane binding assays for peripheral proteins.Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PC:PA liposomes in 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, were added to protein to create a range of 0.5:1 to 10:1 liposome:protein (w/w) concentrations. Samples (200 μl) were incubated with and without K2 (0.2 μg/μl) at room temperature for 1 h before centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min, after which the supernatant and pellet were separated. Pellets were resuspended in the same binding buffer, and both supernatant and pellets were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantification of the bound and unbound protein was made using Bio-Rad Quantity One software, trace quantity command. The amount of protein was quantified by comparison to a gel with known amounts of K2. To determine the affinity of the protein-liposome interaction and to estimate the stoichiometry, the data were fit according to the equation (37Vaz Gomes A. de Waal A. Berden J.A. Westerhoff H.V. Electric potentiation, cooperativity, and synergism of magainin peptides in protein-free liposomes.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5365-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), [K2]b[K2]total=Bmax1+(KdappLh)(Eq. 3) where [K2]b is the amount of bound K2, [K2]total is the total K2 concentration, Bmax is the maximal bound signal, Kdapp is the apparent dissociation constant, L is the total PA concentration, and h is the Hill coefficient. CD data of the dehydrin proteins were collected using a Jasco-815 CD spectropolarimeter (Easton, MD). All protein samples were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration of 0.16 mg/ml (30 μm). A quartz cuvette with a 2-mm pathlength (Hellma, Concord, Canada) containing the protein sample with and without liposome (0.65 mm) or SDS (10 mm) was scanned from 250 to 190 nm. In the SDS titration experiment, the concentration of the detergent was varied between 0 and 1,000 μm. For scans containing liposomes, the spectra were averaged over 25 accumulations. For scans containing SDS, the spectra were averaged over 8 accumulations. All CD experiments were performed at 25 °C. Lyophilized 15N-K2 or 13C/15N-K2 was resuspended in 600 μl of NMR buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.01% sodium azide, 0.1 mm dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid, and 10% D2O (v/v)). Data were collected on a Bruker Avance DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe with the temperature set to 300 K. 1H, 13C, and 15N referencing was performed relative to dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid as described previously (38Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift referencing in biomolecular NMR.J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). For micelle containing samples, 2H-SDS was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. The chemical shifts of K2 alone have been previously measured and are available under Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank entry 16445 (39Findlater E.E. Graether S.P. NMR assignments of the intrinsically disordered K2 and YSK2 dehydrins.Biomol. NMR Assign. 2009; 3: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The backbone and side chain 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts in the presence of 50 mm SDS were assigned by using 1H,15N HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCO, HNCACO, and 15N-edited, CC, and HCCH total correlation spectroscopy experiments (40Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer I, Arthur G. Skelton N.J. Rance M. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2007: 613-678Google Scholar). For the HCN-based experiments, 1,024 (1HN), 64 (13C), and 20 (15N) complex data points were acquired using spectral widths of 7,211.53"
https://openalex.org/W2214309447,"During vertebrate development, the paraxial mesoderm becomes segmented, forming somites that will give rise to dermis, axial skeleton and skeletal muscles. Although recently challenged, the ""clock and wavefront"" model for somitogenesis explains how interactions between several cell-cell communication pathways, including the FGF, RA, Wnt and Notch signals, control the formation of these bilateral symmetric blocks. In the cephalochordate amphioxus, which belongs to the chordate phylum together with tunicates and vertebrates, the dorsal paraxial mesendoderm also periodically forms somites, although this process is asymmetric and extends along the whole body. It has been previously shown that the formation of the most anterior somites in amphioxus is dependent upon FGF signalling. However, the signals controlling somitogenesis during posterior elongation in amphioxus are still unknown. Here we show that, contrary to vertebrates, RA and FGF signals act independently during posterior elongation and that they are not mandatory for posterior somites to form. Moreover, we show that RA is not able to buffer the left/right asymmetry machinery that is controlled through the asymmetric expression of Nodal pathway actors. Our results give new insights into the evolution of the somitogenesis process in chordates. They suggest that RA and FGF pathways have acquired specific functions in the control of somitogenesis in vertebrates. We propose that the ""clock and wavefront"" system was selected specifically in vertebrates in parallel to the development of more complex somite-derived structures but that it was not required for somitogenesis in the ancestor of chordates."
https://openalex.org/W2207920502,"Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) holds a great therapeutic promise for Alzheimer's disease, diabetic neuropathies, ophthalmic diseases, dermatological ulcers. However, the necessity for systemic delivery has hampered the clinical applications of NGF due to its potent pro-nociceptive action. A ""painless"" human NGF (hNGF R100E) mutant has been engineered. It has equal neurotrophic potency to hNGF but a lower nociceptive activity. We previously described and characterized the neurotrophic and nociceptive properties also of the hNGF P61S and P61SR100E mutants, selectively detectable against wild type hNGF. However, the reduced pain-sensitizing potency of the ""painless"" hNGF mutants has not been quantified.Aiming at the therapeutic application of the ""painless"" hNGF mutants, we report on the comparative functional characterization of the precursor and mature forms of the mutants hNGF R100E and hNGF P61SR100E as therapeutic candidates, also in comparison to wild type hNGF and to hNGF P61S. The mutants were assessed by a number of biochemical, biophysical methods and assayed by cellular assays. Moreover, a highly sensitive ELISA for the detection of the P61S-tagged mutants in biological samples has been developed. Finally, we explored the pro-nociceptive effects elicited by hNGF mutants in vivo, demonstrating an expanded therapeutic window with a ten-fold increase in potency.This structure-activity relationship study has led to validate the concept of developing painless NGF as a therapeutic, targeting the NGF receptor system and supporting the choice of hNGF P61S R100E as the best candidate to advance in clinical development. Moreover, this study contributes to the identification of the molecular determinants modulating the properties of the hNGF ""painless"" mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2216021178,"As people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Sub-Saharan Africa live longer due to availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART), so is the rise of associated infections with their burdens on patients. But reliable data on the prevalence of co-infection with hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) still remains sparse and many individuals with HIV do not know their co-infection status. This study attempted to estimate the seroprevalence and identify risk factors associated with hepatitis B and/or C co-infections in HIV-infected individuals from five Regions of Cameroon by screening 531 HIV infected subjects for the presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HCV (HCV-Ab). A Screening and a confirmatory Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect presence of markers of infection. CD4 count levels were also examined. The results indicate that of the 531 participants, 68% were females and 32% males. Mean CD4 count was ~400 cells/μl. Seroprevalence rates for HBsAg and HCV-Ab were 23.7%, and 7.2%, respectively. Associations assessed using logistic regression revealed that HBsAg but not HCV-Ab positivity was linked to age, lower CD4 count and residing in an urban rather than in a rural setting. This high prevalence of co-infection with HBV raises the urgent need to systematically screen all newly diagnosed HIV cases for co-infection in Cameroon and other regions of sub-Saharan Africa where HIV accounts for the majority of the global infection, so as to improve management strategies for HBV infection and ART implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2214265480,"Exercise training (T) blunts functional deficits and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) hyperactivity in hypertensive individuals. There is no information on T-induced temporal changes of brain RAS. We evaluate now the simultaneous effects of T on functional responses and time course changes in the expression/activity of brain RAS components in autonomic cardiovascular-controlling areas.Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and age-matched normotensive controls (WKY) were trained for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Sedentary (S) groups served as time-controls. After arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) recordings at rest, fresh and fixed brains were harvested for qPCR and immunofluorescence assays. SHR-S vs. WKY-S exhibited higher mean AP (MAP) and HR, increased pressure variability and sympathetic activity, elevated AT1 receptor (AT1) expression in nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and higher Mas receptor expression in the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In SHR, T promptly (T2 on) reduced sympathetic variability to heart/vessels and largely decreased angiotensinogen expression in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and NTS, with a late RVLM reduction (T4). AT1 expression was only reduced at T12 (PVN and NTS) with transient, not maintained Mas receptor changes in PVN and RVLM. These responses were accompanied by baseline MAP and HR reduction in the SHR-T (from T4 on). In the SHR group, PVN angiotensinogen expression correlated positively with sympathetic activity, resting MAP and HR. In WKY-T, a precocious (T2-T12) RVLM AT1 decrease preceded the appearance of resting bradycardia (from T8 on).Early and maintained reduction of angiotensinogen content in autonomic areas of the SHR is the most prominent effect of training on brain RAS. Down-regulation of PVN RAS expression is an essential factor to drive cardiovascular benefits in SHR-T, while resting bradycardia in WKY-T is correlated to RVLM AT1 reduction."
https://openalex.org/W2249129748,"Present study deals with the identification of a novel aldo/keto reductase, AKR17A1 from Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and adds on as 17th family of AKR superfamily drawn from a wide variety of organisms. AKR17A1 shares many characteristics of a typical AKR such as- (i) conferring tolerance to multiple stresses like heat, UV-B, and cadmium, (ii) excellent activity towards known AKR substrates (isatin and 2-nitrobenzaldehyde), and (iii) obligate dependence on NADPH as a cofactor for enzyme activity. The most novel attribute of AKR17A1, first reported in this study, is its capability to metabolize butachlor, a persistent rice field herbicide that adversely affects agro-ecosystem and non-target organisms. The AKR17A1 catalyzed- degradation of butachlor resulted into formation of 1,2-benzene dicarboxylic acid and 2,6 bis (1,1, dimethylethyl) 4,-methyl phenol as the major products confirmed by GC-MS analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2177483881,"Poor survival rates from lung cancer can largely be attributed to metastatic cells that invade and spread throughout the body. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is composed of multiple cell types, as well as non-cellular components. The TME plays a critical role in the development of metastatic cancers by providing migratory cues and changing the properties of the tumor cells. The Extracellular Matrix (ECM), a main component of the TME, has been shown to change composition during tumor progression, contributing to cancer cell invasion and survival away from the primary cancer site. Although the ECM is well-known to influence the fate of tumor progression, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that are affected by the cancer cell-ECM interactions. It is imperative that these mechanisms are elucidated in order to properly understand and prevent lung cancer dissemination. However, common in vitro studies do not incorporate these interactions into everyday cell culture assays. We have adopted a model that examines decellularized human fibroblast-derived ECM as a 3-dimensional substrate for growth of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Here, we have characterized the effect of fibroblast-derived matrices on the properties of various lung-derived epithelial cell lines, including cancerous and non-transformed cells. This work highlights the significance of the cell-ECM interaction and its requirement for incorporation into in vitro experiments. Implementation of a fibroblast-derived ECM as an in vitro technique will provide researchers with an important factor to manipulate to better recreate and study the TME."

We investigated CDKN3 mRNA as a survival biomarker and potential therapeutic target for CC. CDKN3 mRNA was measured in 134 CC and 25 controls by quantitative PCR. A 5-year survival study was conducted in 121 of these CC patients. Furthermore, CDKN3-specific siRNAs were used to investigate whether CDKN3 is involved in proliferation, migration, and invasion in CC-derived cell lines (SiHa, CaSki, HeLa). CDKN3 mRNA was on average 6.4-fold higher in tumors than in controls (p = 8 x 10-6, Mann-Whitney). A total of 68.2% of CC patients over expressing CDKN3 gene (fold change ≥ 17) died within two years of diagnosis, independent of the clinical stage and HPV type (Hazard Ratio = 5.0, 95% CI: 2.5-10, p = 3.3 x 10-6, Cox proportional-hazards regression). In contrast, only 19.2% of the patients with lower CDKN3 expression died in the same period. In vitro inactivation of CDKN3 decreased cell proliferation on average 67%, although it had no effect on cell migration and invasion. CDKN3 mRNA may be a good survival biomarker and potential therapeutic target in CC."
https://openalex.org/W2198538484,"Anti-CD52 therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of B cell malignancies, hematopoietic disorders and autoimmune diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis); however the current standard of treatment, the humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab, is associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies in a high proportion of patients. In order to address this problem, we have identified a novel murine anti-CD52 antibody which has been humanized using a process that avoids the inclusion within the variable domains of non-human germline MHC class II binding peptides and known CD4+ T cell epitopes, thus reducing its potential for immunogenicity in the clinic. The resultant humanized antibody, ANT1034, was shown to have superior binding to CD52 expressing cells than alemtuzumab and was more effective at directing both antibody dependent and complement dependent cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, when in the presence of a cross-linking antibody, ANT1034 was more effective at directly inducing apoptosis than alemtuzumab. ANT1034 also showed superior activity in a SCID mouse/human CD52 tumour xenograft model where a single 1 mg/Kg dose of ANT1034 led to increased mouse survival compared to a 10 mg/Kg dose of alemtuzumab. Finally, ANT1034 was compared to alemtuzumab in in vitro T cell assays in order to evaluate its potential to stimulate proliferation of T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from a panel of human donors: whereas alemtuzumab stimulated proliferation in a high proportion of the donor cohort, ANT1034 did not stimulate proliferation in any of the donors. Therefore we have developed a candidate therapeutic humanized antibody, ANT1034, that may have the potential to be more efficacious and less immunogenic than the current standard anti-CD52 therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2218201210,"There is a lack of data for how the viability of biological agents may degrade over time in different environments. In this study, experiments were conducted to determine the persistence of Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus subtilis spores on outdoor materials with and without exposure to simulated sunlight, using ultraviolet (UV)-A/B radiation. Spores were inoculated onto glass, wood, concrete, and topsoil and recovered after periods of 2, 14, 28, and 56 days. Recovery and inactivation kinetics for the two species were assessed for each surface material and UV exposure condition. Results suggest that with exposure to UV, decay of spore viability for both Bacillus species occurs in two phases, with an initial rapid decay, followed by a slower inactivation period. The exception was with topsoil, in which there was minimal loss of spore viability in soil over 56 days, with or without UV exposure. The greatest loss in viable spore recovery occurred on glass with UV exposure, with nearly a four log10 reduction after just two days. In most cases, B. subtilis had a slower rate of decay than B. anthracis, although less B. subtilis was recovered initially."
https://openalex.org/W2214914363,"As mercury (Hg) biosensors are sensitive to only intracellular Hg, they are useful in the investigation of Hg uptake mechanisms and the effects of speciation on Hg bioavailability to microbes. In this study, bacterial biosensors were used to evaluate the roles that several transporters such as the glutathione, cystine/cysteine, and Mer transporters play in the uptake of Hg from Hg-thiol complexes by comparing uptake rates in strains with functioning transport systems to strains where these transporters had been knocked out by deletion of key genes. The Hg uptake into the biosensors was quantified based on the intracellular conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) to elemental mercury (Hg(0)) by the enzyme MerA. It was found that uptake of Hg from Hg-cysteine (Hg(CYS)2) and Hg-glutathione (Hg(GSH)2) complexes occurred at the same rate as that of inorganic complexes of Hg(II) into Escherichia coli strains with and without intact Mer transport systems. However, higher rates of Hg uptake were observed in the strain with a functioning Mer transport system. These results demonstrate that thiol-bound Hg is bioavailable to E. coli and that this bioavailability is higher in Hg-resistant bacteria with a complete Mer system than in non-resistant strains. No difference in the uptake rate of Hg from Hg(GSH)2 was observed in E. coli strains with or without functioning glutathione transport systems. There was also no difference in uptake rates between a wildtype Bacillus subtilis strain with a functioning cystine/cysteine transport system, and a mutant strain where this transport system had been knocked out. These results cast doubt on the viability of the hypothesis that the entire Hg-thiol complex is taken up into the cell by a thiol transporter. It is more likely that the Hg in the Hg-thiol complex is transferred to a transport protein on the cell membrane and is subsequently internalized."

Both species share a common niche, but they are quite different in pathogenicity. Presently, the role of bacteria in pine wilt disease development has been widely speculated. The diversity of bacteria associated with B. xylophilus and B. mucronatus with different virulence remains unclear. In this study, virulence of four B. xylophilus and four B. mucronatus strains were evaluated by inoculating Pinus thunbergii. High-throughput sequencing targeted 16S rDNA of different virulence nematode strains was carried out. The associated bacterial community structures of the eight strains were analyzed. The results showed that 634,051 high-quality sequences were obtained from the eight nematode strains. The number of OTUs of bacteria associated with B. mucronatus was generally greater than those of B. xylophilus. The richness of the community of bacteria associated with high virulent B. xylophilus ZL1 and AmA3 was higher than moderately virulent B. xylophilus AA3, HE2, and all B. mucronatus strains. While the diversity of bacteria associated with B. mucronatus was higher than B. xylophilus. Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonadaceae_Unclassified or Rhizobiaceae_Unclassified were predominant in the nematode strains with different virulence.

https://openalex.org/W2203243983,"Sustainable use of insect resistance in crops require insect resistance management plans that may include a refuge to limit the spread of virulence to this resistance. However, without a loss of fitness associated with virulence, a refuge may not prevent virulence from becoming fixed within a population of parthenogenetically reproducing insects like aphids. Aphid-resistance in soybeans (i.e., Rag genes) prevent outbreaks of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), yet four biotypes defined by their capacity to survive on aphid-resistant soybeans (e.g., biotype-2 survives on Rag1 soybean) are found in North America. Although fitness costs are reported for biotype-3 on aphid susceptible and Rag1 soybean, it is not clear if virulence to aphid resistance in general is associated with a decrease in fitness on aphid susceptible soybeans. In laboratory assays, we measured fitness costs for biotype 2, 3 and 4 on an aphid-susceptible soybean cultivar. In addition, we also observed negative cross-resistance for biotype-2 on Rag3, and biotype-3 on Rag1 soybean. We utilized a simple deterministic, single-locus, four compartment genetic model to account for the impact of these findings on the frequency of virulence alleles. When a refuge of aphid susceptible was included within this model, fitness costs and negative cross-resistance delayed the increase of virulence alleles when virulence was inherited recessively or additively. If virulence were inherited additively, fitness costs decreased the frequency of virulence. Combined, these results suggest that a refuge may prevent virulent A. glycines biotypes from overcoming Rag genes if this aphid-resistance were used commercially in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2253610292,"MAPKs bind to many of their upstream regulators and downstream substrates via a short docking motif (the D-site) on their binding partner. MAPKs that are in different families (e.g. ERK, JNK, and p38) can bind selectively to D-sites in their authentic substrates and regulators while discriminating against D-sites in other pathways. Here we demonstrate that the short hydrophobic region at the distal end of the D-site plays a critical role in determining the high selectivity of JNK MAPKs for docking sites in their cognate MAPK kinases. Changing just 1 or 2 key hydrophobic residues in this submotif is sufficient to turn a weak JNK-binding D-site into a strong one, or vice versa. These specificity-determining differences are also found in the D-sites of the ETS family transcription factors Elk-1 and Net. Moreover, swapping two hydrophobic residues between these D-sites switches the relative efficiency of Elk-1 and Net as substrates for ERK versus JNK, as predicted. These results provide new insights into docking specificity and suggest that this specificity can evolve rapidly by changes to just 1 or 2 amino acids."

To screen for novel lichen secondary metabolites showing inhibitory activity against lung cancer cell motility, we tested acetone extracts of 13 lichen samples collected in Chile. Physciosporin, isolated from Pseudocyphellaria coriacea (Hook f. & Taylor) D.J. Galloway & P. James, was identified as an effective compound and showed significant inhibitory activity in migration and invasion assays against human lung cancer cells. Physciosporin treatment reduced both protein and mRNA levels of N-cadherin with concomitant decreases in the levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as snail and twist. Physciosporin also suppressed KITENIN (KAI1 C-terminal interacting tetraspanin)-mediated AP-1 activity in both the absence and presence of epidermal growth factor stimulation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of the metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, was increased while that of the metastasis enhancer gene, KITENIN, was dramatically decreased by physciosporin. Particularly, the activity of 3'-untranslated region of KITENIN was decreased by physciosporin. Moreover, Cdc42 and Rac1 activities were decreased by physciosporin. These results demonstrated that the lichen secondary metabolite, physciosporin, inhibits lung cancer cell motility through novel mechanisms of action."

Twenty-six experienced triathletes (age = 37.0 ± 6.8 yr; experience = 7.4 ± 3.0 yr) competed in a real half-ironman triathlon in which sector times and total race time were measured by means of chip timing. Before and after the race, a countermovement jump and a maximal isometric force test were performed, and blood samples were withdrawn to measure serum free amino acids concentrations, and serum creatine kinase levels as a blood marker of muscle damage. Total race time was 320 ± 37 min and jump height (-16.3 ± 15.2%, P < 0.001) and isometric force (-14.9 ± 9.8%; P = 0.007) were significantly reduced after the race in all participants. After the race, the serum concentration of creatine kinase increased by 368 ± 187% (P < 0.001). In contrast, the serum concentrations of essential (-27.1 ± 13.0%; P < 0.001) and non-essential amino acids (-24.4 ± 13.1%; P < 0.001) were significantly reduced after the race. The tryptophan/BCAA ratio increased by 42.7 ± 12.7% after the race. Pre-to-post changes in serum free amino acids did not correlate with muscle performance variables or post-race creatine kinase concentration. In summary, during a half-ironman triathlon, serum amino acids concentrations were reduced by > 20%. However, neither the changes in serum free amino acids nor the tryptophan/BCAA ratio were related muscle fatigue or muscle damage during the race."

Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through interviews with parents, guardians, and key informants, and focus group discussions with students. Quantitative data were compared using chi-square tests, Student's T-test, and Poisson regressions. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.Malaria, menstruation, and lack of money were among the most notable determinants of primary school dropout and absenteeism, and these factors disproportionately impacted orphans and female students. Potential mitigation strategies suggested by the community included provision of malaria treatment or prevention, reduction in education costs, expansion of the established school-feeding program, and provision of sanitary pads.Despite free primary education, numerous factors continue to prevent children in rural western Kenya from attending primary school. The findings suggest that interventions should primarily target orphaned and female students. Prior to implementation, suggested mitigation strategies should be assessed for cost-effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2218993119,"Mutations in the TBC1D24 gene are responsible for four neurological presentations: infantile epileptic encephalopathy, infantile myoclonic epilepsy, DOORS (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation and seizures) and NSHL (non-syndromic hearing loss). For the latter, two recessive (DFNB86) and one dominant (DFNA65) mutations have so far been identified in consanguineous Pakistani and European/Chinese families, respectively. Here we report the results of a genetic study performed on a large Moroccan cohort of deaf patients that identified three families with compound heterozygote mutations in TBC1D24. Four novel mutations were identified, among which, one c.641G>A (p.Arg214His) was present in the three families, and has a frequency of 2% in control Moroccan population with normal hearing, suggesting that it acts as an hypomorphic variant leading to restricted deafness when combined with another recessive severe mutation. Altogether, our results show that mutations in TBC1D24 gene are a frequent cause (>2%) of NSHL in Morocco, and that due to its possible compound heterozygote recessive transmission, this gene should be further considered and screened in other deaf cohorts."

The integration site known as AAVS1 is located in chromosome 19 and contains multiple GCTC repeats that are recognized by the AAV non-structural Rep proteins. These proteins are multifunctional, with an N-terminal origin-binding domain (OBD) and a helicase domain joined together by a short linker. As a first step to understand the process of site-specific integration, we proceeded to characterize the recognition and assembly of Rep68 onto the AAVS1 site. We first determined the x-ray structure of AAV-2 Rep68 OBD in complex with the AAVS1 DNA site. Specificity is achieved through the interaction of a glycine-rich loop that binds the major groove and an α-helix that interacts with a downstream minor groove on the same face of the DNA. Although the structure shows a complex with three OBD molecules bound to the AAVS1 site, we show by using analytical centrifugation and electron microscopy that the full-length Rep68 forms a heptameric complex. Moreover, we determined that a minimum of two direct repeats is required to form a stable complex and to melt DNA. Finally, we show that although the individual domains bind DNA poorly, complex assembly requires oligomerization and cooperation between its OBD, helicase, and the linker domains.

https://openalex.org/W2175185018,"Mass-specific metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms consume energy per gram of body weight, is negatively associated with body size in metazoans. As a consequence, small species have higher cellular metabolic rates and are able to process resources at a faster rate than large species. Since mass-specific metabolic rate has been shown to constrain evolution of sperm traits, and most of the metabolic activity of sperm cells relates to ATP production for sperm motility, we hypothesized that mass-specific metabolic rate could influence sperm energetic metabolism at the cellular level if sperm cells maintain the metabolic rate of organisms that generate them. We compared data on sperm straight-line velocity, mass-specific metabolic rate, and sperm ATP content from 40 mammalian species and found that the mass-specific metabolic rate positively influences sperm swimming velocity by (a) an indirect effect of sperm as the result of an increased sperm length, and (b) a direct effect independent of sperm length. In addition, our analyses show that species with higher mass-specific metabolic rate have higher ATP content per sperm and higher concentration of ATP per μm of sperm length, which are positively associated with sperm velocity. In conclusion, our results suggest that species with high mass-specific metabolic rate have been able to evolve both long and fast sperm. Moreover, independently of its effect on the production of larger sperm, the mass-specific metabolic rate is able to influence sperm velocity by increasing sperm ATP content in mammals."

Relative to the homologous AMPA and kainate receptors, NMDA receptors have additional intersubunit contacts in the ligand binding domain that occur at both conserved and non-conserved sites. We examined GluN1/GluN2A single-channel currents with kinetic analyses and modeling to probe these class-specific intersubunit interactions for their role in glutamate binding and receptor gating. We found that substitutions that eliminate such interactions at non-conserved sites reduced stationary gating, accelerated deactivation, and imparted sensitivity to aniracetam, an AMPA receptor-selective positive modulator. Abolishing unique contacts at conserved sites also reduced stationary gating and accelerated deactivation. These results show that contacts specific to NMDA receptors, which brace the heterodimer interface within the ligand binding domain, stabilize actively gating receptor conformations and result in longer bursts and slower deactivations. They support the view that the strength of the heterodimer interface modulates gating in both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors and that unique interactions at this interface are responsible in part for basic differences between the kinetics of NMDA and non-NMDA currents at glutamatergic synapses.

https://openalex.org/W2205302555,"The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a highly conserved florigen gene among flowering plants. Soybean genome encodes six homologs of FT, which display flowering activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their contributions to flowering time in different soybean cultivars, especially in field conditions, are unclear. We employed six soybean cultivars with different maturities to extensively investigate expression patterns of GmFTLs (Glycine max FT-like) and GmCOLs (Glycine max CO-like) in the field conditions. The results show that GmFTL3 is an FT homolog with the highest transcript abundance in soybean, but other GmFTLs may also contribute to flower induction with different extents, because they have more or less similar expression patterns in developmental-, leaf-, and circadian-specific modes. And four GmCOL genes (GmCOL1/2/5/13) may confer to the expression of GmFTL genes. Artificial manipulation of GmFTL expression by transgenic strategy (overexpression and RNAi) results in a distinct change in soybean flowering time, indicating that GmFTLs not only impact on the control of flowering time, but have potential applications in the manipulation of photoperiodic adaptation in soybean. Additionally, transgenic plants show that GmFTLs play a role in formation of the first flowers and in vegetative growth."

https://openalex.org/W2227358311,"Assembly of a death-inducing signaling complex is a key event in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, enabling activation of the caspase cascade and subsequent cell death. However, the molecular events governing DISC assembly have remained largely elusive because of the lack of information on mechanism and specificity regulating the death effector domain (DED)-DED interaction network. Using molecular modeling, mutagenesis, and biochemical and ex vivo experiments, we identified the precise binding interface and hot spots crucial for intermolecular DED chain assembly. Mutation of key interface residues (Leu42/Phe45) in procaspase-8 DED-A completely abrogated DED chain formation in HEK293 cells and prevented its association with FADD. A significant 2.6-3.6-fold reduction in procaspase-8 activation was observed in functional cell-death assays after substitution of the interfacial residues. Based on our results we propose a new model for DISC formation that refines the current understanding of the activation mechanism. Upon stimulation, FADD self-associates weakly via reciprocal interaction between helices α1/α4 and α2/α3 of the DED to form an oligomeric signaling platform that provides a stage for the initial recruitment of procaspase-8 through direct interaction with α1/α4 of DED-A, followed by sequential interaction mediated by helices α2/α5 of DED-B, to form the procaspase-8 DED chain that is crucial for its activation and subsequent cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2263735771,"Babesia spp. (Apicomplexa, Piroplasmida) are obligate parasites of many species of mammals, causing a malaria-like infection- babesiosis. Three routes of Babesia infection have been recognized to date. The main route is by a tick bite, the second is via blood transfusion. The third, vertical route of infection is poorly recognized and understood. Our study focused on vertical transmission of B. microti in a well-established mouse model. We assessed the success of this route of infection in BALB/c mice with acute and chronic infections of B. microti. In experimental groups, females were mated on the 1st day of Babesia infection (Group G0); on the 28th day post infection (dpi) in the post- acute phase of the parasite infection (G28); and on the 90th and 150th dpi (G90 and G150 group, respectively), in the chronic phase of the parasite infection. Pups were obtained from 58% of females mated in the post-acute phase (G28) and from 33% of females in groups G90 and G150. Mice mated in the pre-acute phase of infection (G0) did not deliver pups. Congenital B. microti infections were detected by PCR amplification of Babesia 18S rDNA in almost all pups (96%) from the experimental groups G28, G90 and G150. Parasitaemia in the F1 generation was low and varied between 0.01–0.001%. Vertical transmission of B. microti was demonstrated for the first time in BALB/c mice."
https://openalex.org/W2286299526,"Background Although thyroid eye disease is a common complication of Graves’ disease, the pathogenesis of the orbital disease is poorly understood. Most authorities implicate the immune response as an important causal factor. We sought to clarify pathogenesis by using gene expression microarray. Methods An international consortium of ocular pathologists and orbital surgeons contributed formalin fixed orbital biopsies. RNA was extracted from orbital tissue from 20 healthy controls, 25 patients with thyroid eye disease (TED), 25 patients with nonspecific orbital inflammation (NSOI), 7 patients with sarcoidosis and 6 patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Tissue was divided into a discovery set and a validation set. Gene expression was quantified using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays which include 54,000 probe sets. Results Principal component analysis showed that gene expression from tissue from patients with TED more closely resembled gene expression from healthy control tissue in comparison to gene expression characteristic of sarcoidosis, NSOI, or granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Unsupervised cluster dendrograms further indicated the similarity between TED and healthy controls. Heat maps based on gene expression for cytokines, chemokines, or their receptors showed that these inflammatory markers were associated with NSOI, sarcoidosis, or GPA much more frequently than with TED. Conclusion This is the first study to compare gene expression in TED to gene expression associated with other causes of exophthalmos. The juxtaposition shows that inflammatory markers are far less characteristic of TED relative to other orbital inflammatory diseases."

The behaviors of bus drivers on 32 routes (20% of bus routes in the city) were observed. A two-level Poisson regression examined factors that predicted bus driver violations.The incidence of illegal stopping at bus stations was 20.2%. Illegal stopping was less frequent on weekends, sunny days, and at stations with cameras, with adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) of 0.81, 0.65 and 0.89, respectively. The incidence of violating traffic light signals was 2.2%, and was lower on cloudy than sunny days (adjusted IRR: 0.60). The incidence of distracted driving was 3.3%. The incidence of distracted driving was less common on cloudy days, rainy or snowy days, and foggy/windy/dusty days compared to sunny days, with adjusted IRRs of 0.54, 0.55 and 0.07, respectively.Traffic violations are common in bus drivers in urban China and they are associated with the date, weather, and presence of traffic cameras at bus station. Further studies are recommended to understand the behavioral mechanisms that may explain bus driver violations and to develop feasible prevention measures."

Fifty-four patients with gastric cancer were enrolled at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between January and June 2013. Patients were imaged preoperatively with conventional computed tomography (CT) scans and DECT, and the IC in perigastric fat adjacent to the tumor calculated from arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PVP) images. The patients subsequently received surgical treatment (gastrectomy), and histologic analysis of resected specimens was used as a 'gold standard' reference for cancer staging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to assess the utility of DECT for identifying T4a-stage gastric cancer, with optimal IC thresholds determined from the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Postoperative histology revealed that 32 patients had serosal invasion (group A), and 22 did not (group B). The accuracy of conventional CT for distinguishing stage T4 from non-T4 stages was 68.5% (37/54). IC was significantly higher in group A than in group B (AP: 0.60±0.34 vs. 0.09±0.19 mg/mL, p<0.001; PVP: 0.83±0.41 vs. 0.27±0.21 mg/mL, p<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and AUC for detecting serosal invasion were 77.1%, 79.2% and 0.89 at an IC threshold of 0.25 mg/mL for AP images; and 80.0%, 79.2% and 0.90 at an IC threshold of 0.45 mg/mL for PVP images. These results indicated that Iodine quantification in perigastric fat using DECT is an accurate method for detecting serosal invasion by gastric cancer."

In contrast, mass spectrometry analysis of monoubiquitinated polι revealed that it is ubiquitinated at over 27 unique sites. Many of these sites are localized in different functional domains of the protein, including the catalytic polymerase domain, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting region, the Rev1-interacting region, and its ubiquitin binding motifs UBM1 and UBM2. Polι monoubiquitination remains unchanged after cells are exposed to DNA-damaging agents such as UV light (generating UV photoproducts), ethyl methanesulfonate (generating alkylation damage), mitomycin C (generating interstrand cross-links), or potassium bromate (generating direct oxidative DNA damage). However, when exposed to naphthoquinones, such as menadione and plumbagin, which cause indirect oxidative damage through mitochondrial dysfunction, polι becomes transiently polyubiquitinated via Lys11- and Lys48-linked chains of ubiquitin and subsequently targeted for degradation. Polyubiquitination does not occur as a direct result of the perturbation of the redox cycle as no polyubiquitination was observed after treatment with rotenone or antimycin A, which both inhibit mitochondrial electron transport. Interestingly, polyubiquitination was observed after the inhibition of the lysine acetyltransferase KATB3/p300.

In this study, the high-yield wheat strain Yunong 3114 was EMS-mutagenesis from the wild-type strain Yunong 201, exhibiting a preferable plant structure compared with the wild-type strain. We constructed small RNA and degradome libraries from Yunong 201 and Yunong 3114, and performed small RNA sequencing of these libraries in order identify miRNAs and their targets related to IPA in wheat. Totally, we identified 488 known and 837 novel miRNAs from Yunong 3114 and 391 known and 533 novel miRNAs from Yunong 201. The number of miRNAs in the mutant increased. A total of 37 known and 432 putative novel miRNAs were specifically expressed in the mutant strain; furthermore, 23 known and 159 putative novel miRNAs were specifically expressed in the wild-type strain.

Understanding the effects of policy change on rates and locations of natural ecosystem loss is imperative. In this paper, deforestation in Minas Gerais was simulated annually until 2020 using Dinamica Environment for Geoprocessing Objects (Dinamica EGO). This system is a state-of-the-art land use and cover change (LUCC) model which incorporates government policy, landscape maps, and other biophysical and anthropogenic datasets. Three studied scenarios: (i) business as usual, (ii) increased deforestation, and (iii) decreased deforestation showed more transition to agriculture from shrubland compared to forests, and consistent locations for most deforestation. The probability of conversion to agriculture is strongly tied to areas with the smallest patches of original biome remaining. Increases in agricultural revenue are projected to continue with a loss of 25% of the remaining Cerrado land in the next decade if profit is maximized. The addition of biodiversity value as a tax on land sale prices, estimated at over $750,000,000 USD using the cost of extracting and maintaining current species ex-situ, can save more than 1 million hectares of shrubland with minimal effects on the economy of the State of Minas Gerais. With environmental policy determining rates of deforestation and economics driving the location of land clearing, site-specific protection or market accounting of externalities is needed to balance economic development and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2243176283,"The use of banked human tissue, obtained with informed consent after elective surgical procedures, represents a powerful model for understanding underlying mechanisms of diseases or therapeutic interventions and for establishing prognostic markers. However, donated tissues typically have varying times of warm ischaemia in situ due to blood arrest or cold ischaemia due to procurement and transportation. Hence, before using these tissues, it is important to carry out pre-analytical studies to ensure that they are representative of the in vivo state. In particular, tissues of the gastrointestinal tract have been thought to have low RNA stability. Therefore, this study aimed to determine if extended warm or cold ischaemia times and snap-freezing or banking in RNA stabilization solution affects RNA integrity or gene expression in human ileum mucosa. In short, ileum mucosa was collected for up to 1.5 h and 6 h of simulated warm or cold ischaemia respectively. Subsequently, RNA integrity and gene expressions were determined. It was found that RNA integrity remained high over the course of warm and cold ischaemia examined and there were in general no significant differences between snap-freezing and banking in RNA stabilization solution. Following the same trend, there were in general no significant changes in gene expressions measured (MYC, HIF1α, CDX, HMOX1 and IL1β). In conclusion, RNA in the ileum mucosa is maintained at a high integrity and has stable gene expression over the examined time course of warm or cold ischaemia when banked in RNA stabilization solution or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. As the average warm and cold ischaemia times imposed by surgery and the process of tissue banking are shorter than the time period examined in this study, human ileum mucosa samples collected after surgeries could be used for gene expression studies."

This concern has prompted the use of mathematical models to evaluate strategies to control disease spread, making these models invaluable tools to identify optimal intervention strategies. A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R0. Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R0 from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R0 under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R0 than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R0 and age-specific R0."

We investigated the possibility of applying endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) with conventional preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and computerized tomography (CT) examination to evaluate RLN LN metastasis in patients with esophageal cancer.A total of 115 patients with advanced thoracic esophageal cancer underwent EBUS examinations. Patients also underwent EUS and CT imaging as reference diagnostic methods. Positron emission tomography /computed tomography (PET/CT) was also introduced in partial patients as reference method. The preoperative evaluation of RLN LN metastasis was compared with the surgical and pathological staging in 94 patients who underwent radical surgery.The sensitivities of the preoperative evaluations of RLN LN metastasis by EBUS, EUS and CT were 67.6%, 32.4% and 29.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of EBUS was significantly different from that of EUS or CT, especially in the detection of right RLN LNs. In addition, according to the extra data from reference method, PET/CT was not superior to EBUS or EUS in detecting RLN LN metastasis. Among all 115 patients, 21 patients who were diagnosed with tracheal invasions by EUS or EBUS avoided radical surgery. Another 94 patients who were diagnosed as negative for tracheobronchial tree invasion by EUS and EBUS had no positive findings in radical surgery.EBUS can enhance the preoperative sensitivity of the detection of RLN LN metastasis in cases of thoracic esophageal cancer and is a useful complementary examination to conventional preoperative EUS and CT, which can alert thoracic surgeons to the possibility of a greater range of preoperative lymph node dissection. EBUS may also indicate tracheal invasion in cases of esophageal stricture."
https://openalex.org/W2237797210,"A series of in vitro and in vivo studies has shown that EAF2 can affect multiple signaling pathways involved in cellular processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects have remained elusive. Here we report the discovery of a new functional link between EAF2 and TGF-β signaling. Promoter reporter assays indicated that EAF2 suppresses Smad3 transcriptional activity, resulting in inhibition of TGF-β signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. In addition, we observed that EAF2 binding does not alter Smad3 phosphorylation but causes Smad3 cytoplasmic retention, competes with Smad4 for binding to Smad3, and prevents p300-Smad3 complex formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that EAF2 suppresses both TGF-β-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and TGF-β-induced cell migration. This study identifies and characterizes a novel repressor of TGF-β signaling.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying EAF2 functions remain largely unknown. Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling plays important roles during embryogenesis and in the regulation of cell functions and in tissue homeostasis (8Massagué J.

Smad proteins are critical mediators of TGF-β signaling. After stimulation by TGF-β, the constitutively active type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. Subsequently, the members of the Smad family known as the receptor-activated Smads (R-Smads), 2The abbreviations used are: R-Smadreceptor-activated SmadSARSsevere acute respiratory syndromeCBPCREB-binding proteinMEFmouse embryo fibroblasts. Smad2 and Smad3, are activated by type I receptor-mediated phosphorylation.

Moustakas A. Role of Smads in TGFβ signaling.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In order to perform their crucial roles in TGF-β signaling, Smad proteins are regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation (10Heldin C.H.

In this study we found that EAF2 attenuates TGF-β signaling and specifically interacts with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo but not with other Smad proteins. Moreover, we found that EAF2 impairs Smad3 nuclear translocation, disrupts Smad3-Smad4 complex formation, and prevents the binding of p300 to Smad3. Consequently, EAF2 attenuates TGF-β-induced G1 cell cycle arrest and cell migration. Therefore, our work describes a newly identified player in the TGF-β signaling pathway.

Due to cell death induction in HaCaT cell by VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China), FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) was chosen for HaCaT cell transfection; other cells were transfected with VigoFect. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters using VigoFect (Vigorous Biotech). pTK-Renilla was used as an internal control. For mammalian one-hybridization assays, the pFR-luciferase construct (Stratagene) was used as reporter. After transfection, the cells were treated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) or control for 18 h. Luciferase activity was measured by the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The data are reported as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

For endogenous co-immunoprecipitation, the experimental procedures have been described previously (7Chen Z. Liu X. Mei Z. Wang Z. Xiao W.

After co-immunoprecipitation using GST-Bind resin, the protein was separated by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to a PVDF membrane for detecting His-EAF2 by Western blot analysis. The Fuji Film LAS4000 mini luminescent image analyzer was used for photographing the blots. Multi Gauge V3.0 was used for quantifying the protein levels based on the band density obtained in Western blot analysis. The total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis was carried out using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas). The primers were synthesized following the previous report (14Zhang L. Zhou F. Drabsch Y. Gao R.

Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Nucleus and cytoplasm separation was conducted using the Nucl-Cyto-Mem Preparation kit (P1200, APPLYGEN). Briefly, HaCaT cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids by FuGENE 6 following the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection for 24 h, the cells were treated with vehicle control (PBS) or TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 2 h. Then the cells were washed with PBS and homogenized with a syringe for 40 times in 500 μl of CER buffer provided by the kit. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was saved as the crude nuclei, which was then washed twice with 500 μl of NER buffer provided by the kit. The protein levels were detected by Western blot. HeCaT cells were infected with EAF2 or control lentivirus and treated with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) for 20 h followed by FACS analysis. MEF cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3 × 104 cells/per well. TGF-β (2 ng/ml) was added to cells. After 24 h, the cells were counted by TC-20 cell counter (Bio-Rad). MEF cells in the transwell were treated with TGF-β (200 pm) for 16 h and fixed with methanol. After Giemsa staining, the migrated cells were photographed and quantitated. Human prostate tissue sections were deparaffinized using xylene and rehydrated in graded ethanol (EtOH) series. Rabbit monoclonal anti-EAF2 (Epitomics, 7118-1) and anti-Smad3 (Epitomics, EP568Y) were used for staining. Hematoxylin and eosin were used for counterstaining. To understand the mechanism of EAF2 action in affecting cell function, we sought to determine whether EAF2 could affect TGF-β signaling. Initially, we performed promoter assays by taking advantage of TGF-β-responsive luciferase reporters, including CAGA luciferase reporter, SBE4 luciferase reporter, and ARE luciferase reporter (12Dai F. Chang C. Lin X. Dai P. Mei L. Feng X.H. Erbin inhibits transforming growth factor β signaling through a novel Smad-interacting domain.Mol. Cell.

Upon stimulation with TGF-β (2 ng/ml), the activity of the CAGA luciferase reporter was much lower in EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) as compared with that of EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2−/−) (Fig. 1A). In mink lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells, which retain TGF-β signaling capability (15Feng X.H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R.

Similarly, overexpression of EAF2 in Mv1Lu cells also caused a decrease in SBE4 luciferase reporter activity after the addition of TGF-β (2 ng/ml) (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, overexpression of EAF2 had no effect on ARE luciferase reporter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1D). The ARE-luciferase reporter is known to be activated by both TGF-β and activin via Smad2, Smad4, and FoxH (18Chen X. Weisberg E. Fridmacher V. Watanabe M. Naco G. Whitman M. Smad4 and FAST-1 in the assembly of activin-responsive factor.Nature. 1997; 389: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), implying that Smad2, Smad4, and FoxH might not be the mediators of EAF2 in TGF-β signaling. In contrast, knockdown of EAF2 by shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells enhanced the activity of both CAGA luciferase and SBE4 luciferase reporters in response to stimulation with TGF-β (2 ng/ml) (Fig. 1, E and F). The efficiencies of both EAF2-shRNA-1- and EAF2-shRNA-2-mediated knockdown of EAF2 in HaCaT cells were confirmed using Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, E and F). Therefore, all of these results indicate that EAF2 might inhibit TGF-β signaling. To further determine whether EAF2 indeed attenuates TGF-β signaling, we examined the expression of the downstream target genes of TGF-β signaling using semiquantitative RT-PCR assays and Western blot assays. Upon TGF-β stimulation (2 ng/ml), the expression of Ctgf, Cxcr4, Pai-1, and Smad7 in EAF2 wild type MEF cells (EAF2+/+) were much lower than their observed expression in EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2−/−) (Fig. 2A) (14Zhang L. Zhou F. Drabsch Y. Gao R. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Mickanin C. Huang H. Sheppard K.A. Porter J.A. Lu C.X. ten Dijke P. USP4 is regulated by AKT phosphorylation and directly deubiquitylates TGF-β type I receptor.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of EAF2 HaCaT cells caused expression of PAI-1 and MMP9 to dramatically decrease in the presence of TGF-β (2 ng/ml) (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of EAF2 in HaCaT cells also caused a decrease of PAI-1 and p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2C1). In contrast, knockdown of EAF2 using shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) in HaCaT cells caused an increase of p21 protein levels in the presence of TGF-β (Fig. 2C2). Taken together, these results suggest that EAF2 inhibits TGF-β signaling; however, this inhibition is probably not mediated through EAF2 interactions with Smad2, Smad4, and FoxH. Due to the key regulatory role of the Smad protein family in TGF-β signaling (10Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Role of Smads in TGFβ signaling.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and to gain insight into the mechanism by which EAF2 inhibits TGF-β signaling, we examined whether EAF2 interacts with Smad proteins. Initially, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with Myc-tagged EAF2 together with FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4. As shown in Fig. 3A, EAF2 only interacted with Smad3, which is consistent with the above observations that EAF2 has no effect on ARE luciferase reporter activity. To further confirm that EAF2 only interacts with Smad3, we used HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 to pull down Myc-tagged EAF2. The expression levels of HA-tagged Smad1, Smad2, and Smad3 were quite equivalent, but only HA-tagged Smad3 co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-EAF2 (Fig. 3B). In addition, we found that Smad7 also could not associate with EAF2 (Fig. 3C). To examine whether EAF2 and Smad3 proteins interact endogenously, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays using HaCaT cell extracts by an anti-Smad3 antibody and found that Smad3 interacted with endogenous EAF2 in the both the presence and absence of TGF-β (2 ng/ml) (Fig. 3C). Together, these results suggest that EAF2 specifically interacts with Smad3 in the both presence and absence of TGF-β. Next, we mapped the domains of EAF2 that are responsible for interacting with Smad3 using deletion mutants (Fig. 4A1). As shown in Fig. 4, A2 and A3, the C terminus of EAF2, which consists of amino acids 162–260 comprising exons V-VI, was crucial for interaction with Smad3. Subsequently, we employed GST pulldown assays to map the domains of Smad3 that interact with EAF2. As shown in Fig. 4B, the MH2 domain (amino acids 200–426) interacted with EAF2 directly (10Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Role of Smads in TGFβ signaling.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that EAF2 directly and specifically interacts with Smad3. Because EAF2 inhibits TGF-β signaling and specifically interacts with Smad3, we sought to determine whether EAF2 could inhibit Smad3 transcriptional activity. In Mv1Lu cells, overexpression of EAF2 greatly suppressed Smad3 transcriptional activity both in the absence and presence of TGF-β (2 ng/ml) as revealed using CAGA luciferase reporter activity assays and SBE4 luciferase reporter activity assays (Fig. 5, A1 and A2, respectively). Conversely, in HaCaT cells, knockdown of EAF2 by shRNAs (EAF2-shRNA-1 and EAF2-shRNA-2) enhanced Smad3 transcriptional activity (Fig. 5, B1 and B2). It is known that the domain containing exons I-IV (amino acids 1–161) of EAF2 cannot bind to Smad3, but the domain containing exons V-VI (amino acids 162–260) of EAF2 can bind to Smad3. Therefore, to determine whether the interaction between EAF2 and Smad3 is essential for a suppressive role of EAF2 on Smad3 transcriptional activity, we performed promoter assays in EAF2-null MEF cells (EAF2−/−). As shown in Fig. 5C, overexpression of full-length and the domain of exons V-VI of human EAF2 inhibited Smad3 transcriptional activity, as revealed by CAGA luciferase reporter activity assays and SBE4 luciferase reporter activity assays; however, overexpression of only exons I-IV of EAF2 did not result in inhibition. The protein expression was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggest that inhibition of TGF-β signaling by EAF2 might result from suppression of Smad3 transcriptional activity by EAF2 through a direct Smad3-EAF2 interaction. To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the inhibitory effect of EAF2 on TGF-β signaling, we first examined whether EAF2 could affect the levels of Smad3 protein. As shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of EAF2 in incrementally increasing dosages did not alter Smad3 protein levels at all. In addition, the presence of 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX), accompanied by overexpression of EAF2, also did not affect Smad3 stability (Fig. 6B). Activation of Smad3 involves C-terminal phosphorylation and oligomerization with Smad4 followed by subsequent nuclear translocation (10Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Role of Smads in TGFβ signaling.Cell Tissue Res. 2012; 347: 21-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine whether EAF2 could affect the C-terminal phosphorylation of Smad3. TGF-β treatment could indeed enhance Smad3 phosphorylation, as revealed after detecting using anti-Smad3 (Ser(P)-423/425) antibody (Fig. 6C). However, overexpression of EAF2 had no effect on endogenous Smad3 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of TGF-β (Fig. 6C). Moreover, knockdown of EAF2 also did not affect Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). Therefore, EAF2 neither affects Smad3 protein stability nor affects Smad3 phosphorylation. Regulation of Smad3 nuclear translocation has been reported to be one of the mechanisms for modulation of Smad3 activity (19Xiao Z. Liu X. Henis Y.I. Lodish H.F.

To determine whether EAF2 can affect Smad3 nuclear translocation, we fractionated cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic preparations before preparing extracts. Overexpression of EAF2 could prevent Smad3 nuclear translocation in the presence of TGF-β but not in the absence of TGF-β (Fig. 6E). However, overexpression of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6E), consistent with that EAF2 only interacts with Smad3 revealed above. Furthermore, we examined the effect of EAF2 knockdown on the nuclear translocation of Smad3. Even though the effect of EAF2 knockdown on the nuclear translocation of Smad3 was not as dramatic as that of EAF2 overexpression, knockdown of EAF2 could indeed enhance Smad3 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6F; 1.0 versus 1.28). But knockdown of EAF2 had no obvious effect on Smad2 nuclear translocation (Fig. 6F). Actually, EAF1, a homolog of EAF2, could also specifically interact with Smad3 and inhibits Smad3 activity (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that EAF1 and EAF2 have partial redundant function (6Liu J.X. Zhang D. Xie X. Ouyang G. Liu X. Sun Y. Xiao W.

Therefore, EAF1 might counteract the effect of EAF2 knockdown, resulting in mild enhancement of Smad3 nuclear translocation after EAF2 knockdown. To determine the correlation of EAF2 expression and Smad3 nuclear translocation physiologically, we examined the expressions of both EAF2 and Smad3 in human prostate specimens (n = 6) by immunohistochemical staining in parallel. Among these specimens, when EAF2 was highly expressed in the nuclei of prostate epithelium, Smad3 expression was relatively lower in the nuclei of the same region (n = 4) (Fig. 6G). But when EAF2 was expressed relatively lower in the prostate epithelium, Smad3 expression was relatively higher in the same region (n = 3) (Fig. 6H). Taken together, these observations suggest that EAF2 might attenuate TGF-β signaling by preventing Smad3 nuclear translocation. It has been shown that the"

We determined water distributions along the conduction pores in two tetrameric channels embedded in lipid bilayers using neutron diffraction: potassium channel KcsA and the transmembrane domain of M2 protein of influenza A virus. For the KcsA channel in the closed state, the distribution of water is peaked in the middle of the membrane, showing water in the central cavity adjacent to the selectivity filter. This water is displaced by the channel blocker tetrabutyl-ammonium. The amount of water associated with the channel was quantified, using neutron diffraction and solid state NMR. In contrast, the M2 proton channel shows a V-shaped water profile across the membrane, with a narrow constriction at the center, like the hourglass shape of its internal surface. These two types of water distribution are therefore very different in their connectivity to the bulk water. The water and protein profiles determined here provide important evidence concerning conformation and hydration of channels in membranes and the potential role of pore hydration in channel gating.

These two types of water distribution are therefore very different in their connectivity to the bulk water. The water and protein profiles determined here provide important evidence concerning conformation and hydration of channels in membranes and the potential role of pore hydration in channel gating. There is little experimental evidence or general consensus regarding the presence and dynamics of water in the nonpolar cavities found in channel proteins (1Hilser V.J. Structural biology: finding the wet spots.Nature. 2011; 469: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These cavities serve as sites for uptake and transfer of both nonpolar and polar molecules, including ions, across membranes (2Ball P. Water as an active constituent in cell biology.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 74-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar). In many ion channels, a central cavity is formed between membrane-spanning subunits in the pore domain that contains the ion conduction pathway and selectivity filter (3Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

Rev. 2005; 57: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Although the water in the cavity is thought to be essential for conduction, the presence of water is hard to reconcile with the hydrophobic surface of the cavity. Water in a hydrophobic cavity is like a small water droplet and by the Kelvin equation has increased vapor pressure caused by surface tension, making the droplet unstable to evaporation. Well known examples of this effect in biology are the gas vesicles of marine algae (6Walsby A.E. Gas vesicles.Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 94-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These are formed by a protein wall with an inner hydrophobic surface and contain only gas of the surrounding medium. To overcome Kelvin equation instability, water in the hydrophobic cavities of ion channels must therefore depend on some external hydrogen bonding, the presence of an ion, proximal electric dipoles, and/or small enough size that surface tension is no longer an appropriate parameter. Water in ion channel cavities is difficult to detect, and whether the channels are empty in the closed state is an open question. In vivo functional studies indicated that the gating of voltage-gated ion channels includes both a voltage-dependent component and a solvent-dependent component (7Zimmerberg J. Bezanilla F.

J. 1990; 57: 1049-1064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that the solvent-dependent gating component, also referred to as “hydrophobic gating” (8Aryal P. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. Hydrophobic gating in ion channels.J. Mol. Biol. 2015; 427: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), occurs via a dehydration (“dewetting”) transition that can drive the central cavity to be emptied and collapsed upon closing (9Jensen M.Ø.

Experimentally, detecting hydrophobic gating transitions faces significant challenges: (i) only water molecules that are sufficiently ordered are, typically, visible in x-ray crystal structures, and (ii) structures for only a few voltage-gated channel conformations (usually, open) are available (5Yu F.H.

However, its conformation, hydration state, and interactions with lipid membranes have remained largely unexplored experimentally, limiting our knowledge of the role of water in channel gating mechanisms. Neutron diffraction is the key technique that can address these problems for the following reasons: (i) isomorphous hydrogen-deuterium replacement does not compromise the original structure and is a highly sensitive probe, because of the large difference in scattering length between the two isotopes, and (ii) deuterium atoms in the bilayer can be detected with up to a tenth of an Angstrom accuracy, despite thermal disorder (15Büldt G.

Neutron diffraction is used here, together with solid state NMR to detect and quantify water in KcsA channels reconstituted in lipid membranes with different conditions, including displacement of channel water by tetrabutyl-ammonium. Comparison is made of the water distributions of KcsA with that of the tetrameric M2 (matrix protein 2, integral membrane protein in the viral envelope of influenza A virus) proton channel and demonstrates the structural connection between channel morphologies and the corresponding water profiles in phospholipid membranes. potassium crystallographically sited activation channel from the soil bacteria S. lividans 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside channel to lipid tetrabutyl-ammonium scattering length density magic angle spinning 1,2-didodecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine full width at half maximum.

The KcsA C-terminal domain was removed by digestion with chymotrypsin at a ratio of 1:200 enzyme to KcsA, at 37 °C for 2 h. Concentrations of KcsA were determined by UV absorbance (ϵ = 34,950 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm) after dialysis to remove imidazole. Deuterium-labeled KcsA was produced by growing Escherichia coli in 70% 2H2O in M9 minimal media, whereas 15N-labeled KcsA was expressed using 15N ammonium chloride as nitrogen source. The degree of labeling was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Equimolar mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were used. Approximately 4 mg of lipid mixture was solubilized in 1 mm n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) (Anatrace) and mixed with KcsA at several different channel to lipid (C/L) molar ratios (Table 1). After 30 min, samples were rapidly diluted 20 fold with water, and the proteoliposomes were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets dispersed in 10 ml of water and then recovered by centrifugation as before. This was repeated twice, and the final pellet was dispersed in 400 μl of water. Samples for neutron diffraction were spotted on clean glass microscope coverslips and allowed to dry at room temperature. Several separate preparations yielded roughly 25% recovery of lipid material at channel to lipid (C/L) ratios higher by 15–20% compared with the original mixtures (Table 1). Samples prepared at the same target C/L ratio yielded highly reproducible compositions, neutron diffraction repeat spacings, and water distributions (see “Results”).TABLE 1Measured versus target C/L ratios in lamellar lipid samplesTarget C/L (molar)Measured average C/L (molar)Change (%)1/1501/123181/3001/239201/3001/231231/6001/492181/6001/460231/12001/1041131/12001/105012 Open table in a new tab 5 mm TBA was added to purified KcsA in 1 mm DDM. The pH was reduced to ∼4 by the addition of 1 m HCl, and the acidified solution was incubated at room temperature with rocking for 10 min and then neutralized by the addition of an equal volume of 1 m NaOH. Samples were then mixed with lipid and washed extensively. POPC was used for the reconstitution of KcsA+TBA and the control sample (without TBA). Inclusion of POPG lipid was avoided to prevent issues of phase separation between POPC and POPG when samples were handled and low pH. To quantify lipid recovery, the fluorescent lipid lissamine rhodamine B 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) (Avanti Polar Lipids) was added to the mixture of POPC/POPG at a ratio of 1:6,000. Prior to fluorescence measurements, an equal volume of 6% SDS (w/v) was added to disperse the lipid. Lipid recovery was assessed based on fluorescence compared with a standard curve. Recovered protein concentration was determined by UV absorbance, as above. The samples contained 2.5 mol% of DDM compared with lipid as measured by 1H NMR. Deuterium contents in protein or lipid were determined by MALDI-TOF and electrospray mass spectrometry. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, pH 4, for channel activity and pH 7 as control. Prior to assay, the potassium benzofuranyl indicator (PBFI) (Life Technologies) was added to the buffer to a final concentration of 10 μm. Potassium-loaded vesicles were added, and fluorescence was measured (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 500 nm). Ion selectivity control experiments were performed in the same way using liposomes formed in 200 mm NaCl solution and the sodium benzofuranyl indicator (SBFI) (Life Technologies). Bilayer lipid membranes were formed from 1:1 equimolar mixture of POPC and POPG using the monolayer opposition technique (18Montal M. Mueller P. Formation of bimolecular membranes from lipid monolayers and a study of their electrical properties.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) on a round hole in a film, separating two compartments of an experimental chamber (cis and trans). Hexadecane (Sigma) was used for partition pretreatment. The bilayer bathing solution contained 200 mm KCl, buffered with MES at pH 4. KcsA was added to the cis-side solution in the nearest vicinity of the membrane with a sharp tip, and the membrane was reformed several times after KcsA addition. This method usually yielded stable reconstitution of several KcsA channels. Application of voltage and registration of transmembrane currents were achieved with a pair of Ag/AgCl electrodes with 2 m KCl/agarose bridges, connected to an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices). The applied transmembrane voltage was defined as negative if potential was higher on the cis-side of the chamber. The amplifier signal was in-line filtered by a built-in 8-pole Bessel filter and saved into computer memory with a 5-KHz sampling frequency using ClampEx 10.2. software (Molecular Devices). The current traces were analyzed with PClamp10.2 (Molecular Devices) and Origin 9.0 (Origin lab). After KcsA reconstitution in liposomes, lamellar samples containing roughly 1 milligram of lipid (1000–1500 bilayers) and a few hundred micrograms of protein were produced by fusing the proteoliposomes on the surface of thin glass coverslips and allowing the bulk water to slowly evaporate. Samples were then maintained at 93% relative humidity throughout the measurements, in the vapor of saturated KNO3 salt solutions. Neutron diffraction measurements were performed using the instrument MAGIK at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD). Diffraction from aligned lamellar samples, probing the axis perpendicular to the bilayer plane (z axis) was used to determine one-dimensional scattering length density (SLD) profiles of the bilayer membranes (Equation 1). Structure factors F(h) were obtained as the square root of the integrated peak intensities, corrected for background, Lorentz factors, absorption, and extinction effects, as described previously (19Worcester D.L.

Structure factors were converted, by Fourier synthesis, into a projection of the SLD of the bilayer onto the bilayer normal, according to the following equation. SLD(z)=A∑iWiPi+∑hφh|f(h)|cos(2πhzd)(Eq. 1) The first term in Equation 1 is the average scattering length density of the unit cell: one lipid plus all the other components (water, protein) that contribute their scattering length density ρi = bi/(A*d/2) and their molar fraction (wi) to the repeat unit of area per lipid (A) and height (d). The second term describes the fluctuations in SLD about the average, where f(h) = k*F(h) are the structure factors, calibrated by an amplitude factor (k), to reflect the composition of the bilayer (20Wiener M.C.

J. 1992; 61: 434-447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). For a centrosymmetric system, the phase factors (ϕh) can be +1 or −1. They were determined here by H2O/2H2O contrast methods (19Worcester D.L. Franks N.P. Structural analysis of hydrated egg lecithin and cholesterol bilayers: II. neutron diffraction.J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 100: 359-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The area per lipid (A) varies with composition, hydration, and temperature and was not determined explicitly in these experiments. For convenience, all profiles are determined here on an “absolute relative” scale (22Wiener M.C. King G.I. White S.H. Structure of a fluid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer determined by joint refinement of x-ray and neutron diffraction data: I. scaling of neutron data and the distribution of double-bonds and water.Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 568-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) that leaves (A) undetermined. To determine a calibration (scale) factor (k) for each set of structure factors, we employed deuterium contrast in samples of known composition. Two homologous samples, containing either protonated (H-POPC) or chain deuterated, 1-palmitoylD31-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (D31-POPC) lipid components were measured under constant conditions. The measured compositions of the two homologous samples were: POPC:POPG:DDM:KcsA = 0.486:0.486:0.024:0.004, and D31POPC:POPC:POPG:DDM:KcsA = 0.236:0.250:0.486:0.024:0.004, at 1/235 channels to lipids, molar ratio. In addition, each of the two samples were measured in a series of H2O/2H2O water contrast conditions (100:0, 80:20, 50:50, and 0:100 H2O:2H2O), ensuring a sufficiently large data set for the analysis of the diffraction data (supplemental Tables S1 and S2). The differences in the resulting structure factors from (deuterated versus protonated) sample analogues (Δf = kDFD − kHFH) were converted into the deuterium difference profiles (ΔSLD; Equation 2) to identify the distribution of the deuterated component in the bilayer (15Büldt G. Gally H.U. Seelig A. Seelig J. Zaccai G. Neutron diffraction studies on selectively deuterated phospholipid bilayers.Nature. 1978; 271: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), D31 in this case. ΔSLDD31(z)=[A∑iWi(PiD31−PiH)+2d∑h(kD31FhD31−kHFhH)cos(2πhzd)]H2O2H2D(Eq. 2) The calibration factors (kH, kd31) were determined by requiring that the deuterium signal from the labeled hydrocarbon chains cancels in the aqueous phase (ΔSLDH/D31 (z ≅ d/2) = 0) and performing a simultaneous analysis of the deuterium signal (D31and 2H2O) from the two isomorphous samples. The uncertainties in the calibration factors were determined from the standard deviations in the structure factors (supplemental Tables S1 and S2) and including the uncertainties in sample compositions (wi; Equation 1), where the major contributors are the protein to lipid ratios (Table 1). We used the difference in the calibrated structure factors (supplemental Tables S1 and S2) to find a minimal set of Gaussians that would best fit the data. The Fourier inverted Gaussian model (Eq 3) was compared with the experimental structure factors (supplemental Tables S1 and S2) via a χ2 minimization procedure, ΔH2Of2H2O=∑aie−2(πhαid)2cos(2πhZid)(Eq. 3) where Zi indicates the mean positions of the Gaussian distributions, σi indicates their standard deviations, and ai indicates their amplitudes. The procedure was applied simultaneously for all data sets, for both the H and D31 samples. Experiments were conducted on a AV800 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Inc., Billerica, MA) equipped with a 1H/13C/2H-g-HR-MAS-800-SB-BL4 probe for determination of water content and a 1H/13C/15N-PH-MAS-800-SB-BL4 probe for determination of hydrogen to deuterium exchange. Samples were deposited as thin film on the inner wall of a ZrO2 4-mm rotor by rotation of the horizontally oriented rotor containing KcsA/lipid proteoliposomes in H2O. A stream of air was applied to remove excess water. This resulted in the formation of stacked bilayers on the rotor wall with a thickness similar to neutron experiments. The samples were then equilibrated in H2O or 2H2O vapor of a saturated KNO3 salt solution (93% relative humidity, 21.5 ± 0.5 °C) After hydration, rotors were sealed with a Kel-F cap, and the water content was measured by 1H MAS NMR at a MAS frequency of 5 kHz. Integral intensity of the water resonance at 4.8 ppm was determined by spectral deconvolution. Water content is reported relative to intensity of the choline resonance at 3.25 ppm. Measurements on 15N-KcsA/POPC/POPG samples were conducted to determine the amount of hydrogen to deuterium exchange in KcsA. The 15N MAS NMR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature by 1H-15N cross-polarization, a MAS frequency of 5 kHz, a 3.7-μs 1H 90° pulse, 1-ms 1H-15N cross-polarization at (γ/2π)B1 = 40 kHz with a 100–80% linear ramp on the 1H channel, (γ/2π)B1 = 62 kHz 1H decoupling during 15N detection using a spinal-64 sequence, 77,000 scans, 1024 data points at a dwell time of 5 μs, and 1-s delay time between scans. Oriented lipid multilayers with and without M2 (residues 22–46) peptides were prepared by slow evaporation of solvent on thin glass microscope slide coverslips at temperatures of about 37 °C. Solvents were ethanol/water mixtures, usually 3/2 by volume. Thin samples of about 1000 layers or less gave distinctly better diffraction, especially with annealing at high humidity and 37 °C. Multilayers prepared this way are centrosymmetric, with channels oriented both ways across the membrane. Similar results were obtained with 1,2-didodecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or POPC, of which DLPC gave best diffraction, based on mosaic spread and resolution. Peptide/lipid ratios were high, 1/3 or 1/4 molar, so that channel features would be prominent in profiles. To obtain structural information from KcsA/lipid samples amenable for neutron diffraction measurements, we produced oriented lamellar samples of lipid bilayers containing KcsA (Fig. 1) starting from proteoliposome solutions. The reconstituted channels were found to adopt a structurally stable tetrameric state (Fig. 2a). We tested the viability of the tetrameric channels in proteoliposomes using our bulk functional assay (“Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2, b–d). At neutral pH, KcsA was demonstrated to adopt a closed, stable conformation, with a very low open probability, even when the intracellular C-terminal amino acids were removed (23Cuello L.G.

Physiol. 1999; 114: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Our preparations of both C-terminal truncated KcsA (ctd-KcsA: amino-acids 126–160 removed) and full-length (fl-KcsA) in proteoliposomes resulted in a functional population of channels that are conductive at pH 4 and nonconductive at pH 7 (Fig. 2, a–d). The selectivity for conduction of K+ versus Na+ ions was also verified (data not shown). Lamellar samples (Fig. 1a) were obtained from proteoliposomes containing ctd-KcsA at neutral pH. For further characterization, we performed single channel recordings of KcsA extracted from the lamellar samples by resuspension in buffer solution. The data show that channels were viable, displaying characteristic conductance upon incorporation in planar black lipid membranes (Fig. 2, e–g). Measured single-channel current-voltage curves match well with KcsA currents obtained by LeMasurier et al. (25LeMasurier M. Heginbotham L. Miller C. KcsA: it's a potassium channel.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2f). Neutron diffraction was then performed on fully characterized samples, under controlled hydration and temperature, maintaining the bilayers in the biologically relevant (Lα) phase. Although thermal disorder limits the amount of observable Bragg intensity to 4 or 5 orders of diffraction, this does not limit the amount of information that can be extracted by deuterium difference analysis, as will be described below. Unique sets of diffraction intensities can be clearly distinguished depending on deuteration (Fig. 3, a and b). Despite the high protein concentration, the quality of the lamellar samples was remarkably high, as demonstrated by examining both out of plane (Fig. 3, a and b) and in-plane diffraction data (Fig. 3c) and the mosaic spread of the oriented samples (Fig. 3d). The data show that the samples were homogeneous with no indications of in-plane crystallization of the protein or domain formation. The repeat spacing, d (Fig. 1a), was identical (51.4 ± 0.1 Å) for KcsA samples of the same composition (Fig. 3, a and b), but 1.8 Å smaller compared with neat bilayers (not shown), indicating a reorganization of the lipid and water to accommodate the channel proteins.FIGURE 2Functional reconstitution of KcsA in lipid membranes for lamellar diffraction. a, SDS-PAGE gel images of full-length (FL-KcsA) and C-terminal truncated KcsA (CTD-KcsA) after reconstitution in POPC/POPG liposomes. b, the activity of both full-length and C-terminally truncated KcsA were assayed using the potassium-sensitive fluorescent dye PBFI. Potassium trapped in proteoliposomes with KcsA is released at pH 4 (FL, green; CTD, purple) and not at pH 7 (FL, red; CTD, blue). The error bars are standard deviations (1 σ) of fluorescence intensity measurements. c, for control, all trapped potassium was released with Triton-X100 showing presence of K+ in all tested liposomes. d, samples of KcsA in complex with TBA showed significantly inhibited K+ release from proteoliposomes (green), at pH 4, compared with KcsA without TBA (purple) and is comparable with closed channels at pH 7 (orange). e, single-channel recordings of KcsA recovered from dry lamellar samples. Typical traces of transmembrane current recorded at ±40 mV upon addition of KcsA.

https://openalex.org/W2204522533,"Background Use of the tuberculin skin test (TST) for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among individuals who received the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is complicated by its potential cross-reaction with TST antigens which may cause false-positive results and lead to patient and physician reluctance to initiate LTBI treatment. QuantiFERON®-TB Gold (QFT-G) lacks this cross-reaction. We sought to study the impact of implementing QFT-G testing in 2006 on LTBI treatment initiation and completion at NYC chest clinics. Methods QFT-G results from 10/2006–12/2008 in NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene chest clinics were obtained from the electronic medical record system. The proportions of patients who initiated and completed treatment among patients tested with QFT-G were compared to those tested with TST from 10/2004–9/2006. Results Among 36,167 patients tested with QFT-G, 2,300 (6%) tested positive, 33,327 (93%) tested negative, and 540 (1%) had an indeterminate result. Among those who had a positive QFT-G test and deemed eligible, 985 (80%) initiated LTBI treatment and 490 (40%) completed treatment. Historically, among patients tested with TST, 7,073 (19%) tested positive (p<0.0001 compared to QFT-G); 3,182 (79%) of those eligible initiated LTBI treatment and 1,210 (30%) completed treatment (p<0.0001 compared to QFT-G). Conclusions QFT-G implementation increased the proportion of patients completing LTBI treatment. Additional studies are needed in more settings to determine whether using QFT-G leads to a sustained increase in treatment completion."
https://openalex.org/W1470661277,"Biosynthesis of the popular dyestuff indigo from indole has been comprehensively studied using pure cultures, but less has been done to characterize the indigo production by microbial communities. In our previous studies, a wild strain Comamonas sp. MQ was isolated from activated sludge and the recombinant Escherichia coli nagAc carrying the naphthalene dioxygenase gene (nag) from strain MQ was constructed, both of which were capable of producing indigo from indole. Herein, three activated sludge systems, G1 (non-augmented control), G2 (augmented with Comamonas sp. MQ), and G3 (augmented with recombinant E. coli nagAc), were constructed to investigate indigo production. After 132-day operation, G3 produced the highest yields of indigo (99.5 ± 3.0 mg/l), followed by G2 (27.3 ± 1.3 mg/l) and G1 (19.2 ± 1.2 mg/l). The microbial community dynamics and activities associated with indigo production were analyzed by Illumina Miseq sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The inoculated strain MQ survived for at least 30 days, whereas E. coli nagAc was undetectable shortly after inoculation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis suggested the abundance of naphthalene dioxygenase gene (nagAc) from both inoculated strains was strongly correlated with indigo yields in early stages (0-30 days) (P < 0.001) but not in later stages (30-132 days) (P > 0.10) of operation. Based on detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and dissimilarity test results, the communities underwent a noticeable shift during the operation. Among the four major genera (> 1% on average), the commonly reported indigo-producing populations Comamonas and Pseudomonas showed no positive relationship with indigo yields (P > 0.05) based on Pearson correlation test, while Alcaligenes and Aquamicrobium, rarely reported for indigo production, were positively correlated with indigo yields (P < 0.05). This study should provide new insights into our understanding of indigo bio-production by microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2204857641,"The delivery of mental health services in rural China has been notably limited due to lack of qualified mental health professionals among other impeding factors. A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China.We conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis.The village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention.The present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2216624418,"Head and neck cancer is often diagnosed at advanced stages, and surgical resection with wide margins is generally indicated, despite this treatment being associated with poor postoperative quality of life (QOL). We have previously reported on the therapeutic effects of skeletal muscle-derived multipotent stem cells (Sk-MSCs), which exert reconstitution capacity for muscle-nerve-blood vessel units. Recently, we further developed a 3D patch-transplantation system using Sk-MSC sheet-pellets. The aim of this study is the application of the 3D Sk-MSC transplantation system to the reconstitution of facial complex nerve-vascular networks after severe damage. Mouse experiments were performed for histological analysis and rats were used for functional examinations. The Sk-MSC sheet-pellets were prepared from GFP-Tg mice and SD rats, and were transplanted into the facial resection model (ST). Culture medium was transplanted as a control (NT). In the mouse experiment, facial-nerve-palsy (FNP) scoring was performed weekly during the recovery period, and immunohistochemistry was used for the evaluation of histological recovery after 8 weeks. In rats, contractility of facial muscles was measured via electrical stimulation of facial nerves root, as the marker of total functional recovery at 8 weeks after transplantation. The ST-group showed significantly higher FNP (about three fold) scores when compared to the NT-group after 2-8 weeks. Similarly, significant functional recovery of whisker movement muscles was confirmed in the ST-group at 8 weeks after transplantation. In addition, engrafted GFP+ cells formed complex branches of nerve-vascular networks, with differentiation into Schwann cells and perineurial/endoneurial cells, as well as vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Thus, Sk-MSC sheet-pellet transplantation is potentially useful for functional reconstitution therapy of large defects in facial nerve-vascular networks."
https://openalex.org/W2178129703,"Previous work by our group described that human β-defensin-2 induces accumulation of extracellular adenosine (Ado) in E. coli cultures through a non-lytic mechanism causing severe plasmolysis. Here, we investigate the presence of AMP as a direct precursor and the involvement of a bacterial enzyme in the generation of extracellular Ado by treated bacteria. Following hBD-2 treatment, metabolites were quantified in the supernatants using targeted HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Microbial growth was monitored by optical density and cell viability was determined by colony forming units counts. Phosphatase activity was measured using chromogenic substrate pNPP. The results demonstrate that defensin-treated E. coli strain W releases AMP in the extracellular space, where it is converted to Ado by a bacterial soluble factor. An increase in phosphatase activity in the supernatant was observed after peptide treatment, similar to the effect of sucrose-induced osmotic stress, suggesting that the periplasmic 5'nucleotidase (5'-NT) is released following the plasmolysis event triggered by the peptide. Ado accumulation was enhanced in the presence of Co2+ ion and inhibited by EDTA, further supporting the involvement of a metallo-phosphatase such as 5'-NT in extracellular AMP conversion into Ado. The comparative analysis of hBD-induced Ado accumulation in different E. coli strains and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that the response is not correlated to the peptide's effect on cell viability, but indicates it might be dependent on the subcellular distribution of the nucleotidase. Taken together, these data shed light on a yet undescribed mechanism of host-microbial interaction: a human antimicrobial peptide inducing selective release of a bacterial enzyme (E. coli 5'-NT), leading to the formation of a potent immunomodulator metabolite (Ado)."
https://openalex.org/W2341970766,"Different nosocomial pathogen species have varying infectivity and durations of infectiousness, while the transmission route determines the contact rate between pathogens and susceptible patients. To determine if the pathogen species and transmission route affects the size and spread of outbreaks, we perform a meta-analysis that examines data from 933 outbreaks of hospital-acquired infection representing 14 pathogen species and 8 transmission routes. We find that the mean number of cases in an outbreak is best predicted by the pathogen species and the mean number of cases per day is best predicted by the species-transmission route combination. Our fitted model predicts the largest mean number of cases for Salmonella outbreaks (22.3) and the smallest mean number of cases for Streptococci outbreaks (8.5). The largest mean number of cases per day occurs during Salmonella outbreaks spread via the environment (0.33) and the smallest occurs for Legionella outbreaks spread by multiple transmission routes (0.005). When combined with information on the frequency of outbreaks these findings could inform the design of infection control policies in hospitals."
