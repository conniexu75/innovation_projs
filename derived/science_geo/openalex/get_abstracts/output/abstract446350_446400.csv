https://openalex.org/W2008285918,"The Wnt target gene Lgr5 (leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5) marks actively dividing stem cells in Wnt-driven, self-renewing tissues such as small intestine and colon, stomach and hair follicles. A three-dimensional culture system allows long-term clonal expansion of single Lgr5(+) stem cells into transplantable organoids (budding cysts) that retain many characteristics of the original epithelial architecture. A crucial component of the culture medium is the Wnt agonist RSPO1, the recently discovered ligand of LGR5. Here we show that Lgr5-lacZ is not expressed in healthy adult liver, however, small Lgr5-LacZ(+) cells appear near bile ducts upon damage, coinciding with robust activation of Wnt signalling. As shown by mouse lineage tracing using a new Lgr5-IRES-creERT2 knock-in allele, damage-induced Lgr5(+) cells generate hepatocytes and bile ducts in vivo. Single Lgr5(+) cells from damaged mouse liver can be clonally expanded as organoids in Rspo1-based culture medium over several months. Such clonal organoids can be induced to differentiate in vitro and to generate functional hepatocytes upon transplantation into Fah(-/-) mice. These findings indicate that previous observations concerning Lgr5(+) stem cells in actively self-renewing tissues can also be extended to damage-induced stem cells in a tissue with a low rate of spontaneous proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1973408460,"A draft sequence of the staple crop kabuli chickpea, together with resequencing and analysis of 90 additional lines from 10 countries, provides a resource for breeders. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is the second most widely grown legume crop after soybean, accounting for a substantial proportion of human dietary nitrogen intake and playing a crucial role in food security in developing countries. We report the ∼738-Mb draft whole genome shotgun sequence of CDC Frontier, a kabuli chickpea variety, which contains an estimated 28,269 genes. Resequencing and analysis of 90 cultivated and wild genotypes from ten countries identifies targets of both breeding-associated genetic sweeps and breeding-associated balancing selection. Candidate genes for disease resistance and agronomic traits are highlighted, including traits that distinguish the two main market classes of cultivated chickpea—desi and kabuli. These data comprise a resource for chickpea improvement through molecular breeding and provide insights into both genome diversity and domestication."
https://openalex.org/W2057029832,"In mice performing an operant task, increases in neural activity in direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs) are associated with action initiation but not with inactivity, and concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one hemisphere precedes the initiation of contraversive movements. The prevailing view of the functional organization of the basal ganglia, brain areas involved in movement control, is that there are two distinct, and opposing, neural circuits that facilitate and inhibit movement. Costa and colleagues have developed a new in vivo technique for monitoring the activity of specific cell types deep in the brain via fibre optics, and use it to monitor activity in these two pathways in freely behaving rodents. Rather than opposing activity, both pathways are active before movements are initiated. This challenges the classical view of basal ganglia function, and may have implications for understanding the origin of motor symptoms in disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei that control voluntary actions, and they are affected by a number of debilitating neurological disorders1,2,3,4. The prevailing model of basal ganglia function proposes that two orthogonal projection circuits originating from distinct populations of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the striatum5,6—the so-called direct and indirect pathways—have opposing effects on movement: activity of direct-pathway SPNs is thought to facilitate movement, whereas activity of indirect-pathway SPNs is presumed to inhibit movement1,2. This model has been difficult to test owing to the lack of methods to selectively measure the activity of direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs in freely moving animals. Here we develop a novel in vivo method to specifically measure direct- and indirect-pathway SPN activity, using Cre-dependent viral expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI) GCaMP3 in the dorsal striatum of D1-Cre (direct-pathway-specific6,7) and A2A-Cre (indirect-pathway-specific8,9) mice10. Using fibre optics and time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) in mice performing an operant task, we observed transient increases in neural activity in both direct- and indirect-pathway SPNs when animals initiated actions, but not when they were inactive. Concurrent activation of SPNs from both pathways in one hemisphere preceded the initiation of contraversive movements and predicted the occurrence of specific movements within 500 ms. These observations challenge the classical view of basal ganglia function and may have implications for understanding the origin of motor symptoms in basal ganglia disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2100982253,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often expressed in a development-specific manner, yet little is known about their roles in lineage commitment. Here, we identified Braveheart (Bvht), a heart-associated lncRNA in mouse. Using multiple embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation strategies, we show that Bvht is required for progression of nascent mesoderm toward a cardiac fate. We find that Bvht is necessary for activation of a core cardiovascular gene network and functions upstream of mesoderm posterior 1 (MesP1), a master regulator of a common multipotent cardiovascular progenitor. We also show that Bvht interacts with SUZ12, a component of polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2), during cardiomyocyte differentiation, suggesting that Bvht mediates epigenetic regulation of cardiac commitment. Finally, we demonstrate a role for Bvht in maintaining cardiac fate in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Together, our work provides evidence for a long noncoding RNA with critical roles in the establishment of the cardiovascular lineage during mammalian development."
https://openalex.org/W2162980030,"Digital production, transmission and storage have revolutionized how we access and use information but have also made archiving an increasingly complex task that requires active, continuing maintenance of digital media. This challenge has focused some interest on DNA as an attractive target for information storage because of its capacity for high-density information encoding, longevity under easily achieved conditions and proven track record as an information bearer. Previous DNA-based information storage approaches have encoded only trivial amounts of information or were not amenable to scaling-up, and used no robust error-correction and lacked examination of their cost-efficiency for large-scale information archival. Here we describe a scalable method that can reliably store more information than has been handled before. We encoded computer files totalling 739 kilobytes of hard-disk storage and with an estimated Shannon information of 5.2 × 10(6) bits into a DNA code, synthesized this DNA, sequenced it and reconstructed the original files with 100% accuracy. Theoretical analysis indicates that our DNA-based storage scheme could be scaled far beyond current global information volumes and offers a realistic technology for large-scale, long-term and infrequently accessed digital archiving. In fact, current trends in technological advances are reducing DNA synthesis costs at a pace that should make our scheme cost-effective for sub-50-year archiving within a decade."

https://openalex.org/W2022229270,"This study demonstrates that an inheritable adult onset heart disease can be modelled in vitro within months with the help of metabolic maturation induction. Recent advances in cellular reprogramming of fibroblasts as patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have made it possible to model genetic disorders in vitro. But for adult-onset conditions, tissues derived from iPSCs or stem cells, such as cardiomyocytes or neurons, tend to 'reset' to an embryo-like state, losing the disease characteristic that emerged after a period of latency. This study demonstrates that an inheritable adult-onset disease can be modelled within months. The authors used patient-specific iPSCs with a plakophilin-2 mutation to model arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy. Typical pathology was not evident at first, but emerged within 2 months when adult-like energy metabolism was induced using a 5-factor protocol. Cellular reprogramming of somatic cells to patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) enables in vitro modelling of human genetic disorders for pathogenic investigations and therapeutic screens1,2,3,4,5,6,7. However, using iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) to model an adult-onset heart disease remains challenging owing to the uncertainty regarding the ability of relatively immature iPSC-CMs to fully recapitulate adult disease phenotypes. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an inherited heart disease characterized by pathological fatty infiltration and cardiomyocyte loss predominantly in the right ventricle8, which is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Over 50% of affected individuals have desmosome gene mutations, most commonly in PKP2, encoding plakophilin-2 (ref. 9). The median age at presentation of ARVD/C is 26 years8. We used previously published methods1,10 to generate iPSC lines from fibroblasts of two patients with ARVD/C and PKP2 mutations11,12. Mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs demonstrate abnormal plakoglobin nuclear translocation and decreased β-catenin activity13 in cardiogenic conditions; yet, these abnormal features are insufficient to reproduce the pathological phenotypes of ARVD/C in standard cardiogenic conditions. Here we show that induction of adult-like metabolic energetics from an embryonic/glycolytic state and abnormal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) activation underlie the pathogenesis of ARVD/C. By co-activating normal PPAR-alpha-dependent metabolism and abnormal PPAR-γ pathway in beating embryoid bodies (EBs) with defined media, we established an efficient ARVD/C in vitro model within 2 months. This model manifests exaggerated lipogenesis and apoptosis in mutant PKP2 iPSC-CMs. iPSC-CMs with a homozygous PKP2 mutation also had calcium-handling deficits. Our study is the first to demonstrate that induction of adult-like metabolism has a critical role in establishing an adult-onset disease model using patient-specific iPSCs. Using this model, we revealed crucial pathogenic insights that metabolic derangement in adult-like metabolic milieu underlies ARVD/C pathologies, enabling us to propose novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2108806843,"Mechanical responsiveness is essential to all biological systems down to the level of tissues and cells. The intra- and extracellular mechanics of such systems are governed by a series of proteins, such as microtubules, actin, intermediate filaments and collagen. As a general design motif, these proteins self-assemble into helical structures and superstructures that differ in diameter and persistence length to cover the full mechanical spectrum. Gels of cytoskeletal proteins display particular mechanical responses (stress stiffening) that until now have been absent in synthetic polymeric and low-molar-mass gels. Here we present synthetic gels that mimic in nearly all aspects gels prepared from intermediate filaments. They are prepared from polyisocyanopeptides grafted with oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. These responsive polymers possess a stiff and helical architecture, and show a tunable thermal transition where the chains bundle together to generate transparent gels at extremely low concentrations. Using characterization techniques operating at different length scales (for example, macroscopic rheology, atomic force microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy) combined with an appropriate theoretical network model, we establish the hierarchical relationship between the bulk mechanical properties and the single-molecule parameters. Our results show that to develop artificial cytoskeletal or extracellular matrix mimics, the essential design parameters are not only the molecular stiffness, but also the extent of bundling. In contrast to the peptidic materials, our polyisocyanide polymers are readily modified, giving a starting point for functional biomimetic hydrogels with potentially a wide variety of applications, in particular in the biomedical field."
https://openalex.org/W2030353060,"Age-related cognitive decline is paralleled by two other prominent brain changes: structural atrophy prominent in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and disrupted non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow-wave sleep (SWS). This study establishes an interaction between these factors, demonstrating that the extent of mPFC atrophy predicts the degree of impaired NREM SWS quality, thereby compromising hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation in the aging human brain. Aging has independently been associated with regional brain atrophy, reduced slow wave activity (SWA) during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and impaired long-term retention of episodic memories. However, whether the interaction of these factors represents a neuropatholgical pathway associated with cognitive decline in later life remains unknown. We found that age-related medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) gray-matter atrophy was associated with reduced NREM SWA in older adults, the extent to which statistically mediated the impairment of overnight sleep–dependent memory retention. Moreover, this memory impairment was further associated with persistent hippocampal activation and reduced task-related hippocampal-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, potentially representing impoverished hippocampal-neocortical memory transformation. Together, these data support a model in which age-related mPFC atrophy diminishes SWA, the functional consequence of which is impaired long-term memory. Such findings suggest that sleep disruption in the elderly, mediated by structural brain changes, represents a contributing factor to age-related cognitive decline in later life."
https://openalex.org/W2003870213,"The amygdala is essential for fear learning and expression. The central amygdala (CeA), once viewed as a passive relay between the amygdala complex and downstream fear effectors, has emerged as an active participant in fear conditioning. However, the mechanism by which CeA contributes to the learning and expression of fear is unclear. We found that fear conditioning in mice induced robust plasticity of excitatory synapses onto inhibitory neurons in the lateral subdivision of the CeA (CeL). This experience-dependent plasticity was cell specific, bidirectional and expressed presynaptically by inputs from the lateral amygdala. In particular, preventing synaptic potentiation onto somatostatin-positive neurons impaired fear memory formation. Furthermore, activation of these neurons was necessary for fear memory recall and was sufficient to drive fear responses. Our findings support a model in which fear conditioning-induced synaptic modifications in CeL favor the activation of somatostatin-positive neurons, which inhibit CeL output, thereby disinhibiting the medial subdivision of CeA and releasing fear expression."
https://openalex.org/W2032630075,"MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is frequently upregulated in various types of human cancer; however, its role in cancer angiogenesis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the role of miR-155 in angiogenesis through targeting von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor in breast cancer. Ectopic expression of miR-155 induced whereas knockdown of miR-155 inhibited human umbilical vein endothelial cell network formation, proliferation, invasion and migration. Furthermore, mammary fat pad xenotransplantation of ectopically expressed miR-155 resulted in extensive angiogenesis, proliferation, tumour necrosis and recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells such as tumour-associated macrophages. Expression of VHL abrogated these miR-155 effects. Moreover, miR-155 expression inversely correlates with VHL expression level and is associated with late-stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis, as well as triple-negative tumour in breast cancer. These findings indicate that miR-155 has a pivotal role in tumour angiogenesis by downregulation of VHL, and provide a basis for miR-155-expressing tumours to embody an aggressive malignant phenotype, and therefore miR-155 is an important therapeutic target in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2100218575,"Despite advances in our understanding of breast cancer, patients with metastatic disease have poor prognoses. GATA3 is a transcription factor that specifies and maintains mammary luminal epithelial cell fate, and its expression is lost in breast cancer, correlating with a worse prognosis in human patients. Here, we show that GATA3 promotes differentiation, suppresses metastasis and alters the tumour microenvironment in breast cancer by inducing microRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression. Accordingly, miR-29b is enriched in luminal breast cancers and loss of miR-29b, even in GATA3-expressing cells, increases metastasis and promotes a mesenchymal phenotype. Mechanistically, miR-29b inhibits metastasis by targeting a network of pro-metastatic regulators involved in angiogenesis, collagen remodelling and proteolysis, including VEGFA, ANGPTL4, PDGF, LOX and MMP9, and targeting ITGA6, ITGB1 and TGFB, thereby indirectly affecting differentiation and epithelial plasticity. The discovery that a GATA3-miR-29b axis regulates the tumour microenvironment and inhibits metastasis opens up possibilities for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer. Werb and colleagues demonstrate that GATA3, a transcription factor that promotes luminal differentiation in the mammary gland, suppresses breast cancer metastasis to the lung by upregulating miR-29b. This microRNA suppresses pro-metastatic characteristics, including mesenchymal traits and the expression of microenvironmental factors involved in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W1971176522,"Tim Chan and colleagues report the identification of recurrent somatic mutations in FAT1 in glioblastoma, colon cancer and head and neck cancer and show that inactivation of FAT1 promotes Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis. Aberrant Wnt signaling can drive cancer development. In many cancer types, the genetic basis of Wnt pathway activation remains incompletely understood. Here, we report recurrent somatic mutations of the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor–related gene FAT1 in glioblastoma (20.5%), colorectal cancer (7.7%), and head and neck cancer (6.7%). FAT1 encodes a cadherin-like protein, which we found is able to potently suppress cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo by binding β-catenin and antagonizing its nuclear localization. Inactivation of FAT1 via mutation therefore promotes Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis and affects patient survival. Taken together, these data strongly point to FAT1 as a tumor suppressor gene driving loss of chromosome 4q35, a prevalent region of deletion in cancer. Loss of FAT1 function is a frequent event during oncogenesis. These findings address two outstanding issues in cancer biology: the basis of Wnt activation in non-colorectal tumors and the identity of a 4q35 tumor suppressor."
https://openalex.org/W1982567191,"Using simultaneous electrocorticographical recordings in multiple lobes in human subjects performing memory retrieval tasks, this study finds that oscillatory coupling across a network of brain regions predicts successful memory recall. The study also shows that this increased network connectivity converges at the medial temporal lobe, with different neural signatures for spatial versus temporal components of episodic memory retrieval. The medial temporal lobes, prefrontal cortex and parts of parietal cortex form the neural underpinnings of episodic memory, which includes remembering both where and when an event occurred. However, the manner in which these three regions interact during retrieval of spatial and temporal context remains untested. We employed simultaneous electrocorticographical recordings across multilobular regions in patients undergoing seizure monitoring while they retrieved spatial and temporal context associated with an episode, and we used phase synchronization as a measure of network connectivity. Successful memory retrieval was characterized by greater global connectivity compared with incorrect retrieval, with the medial temporal lobe acting as a hub for these interactions. Spatial versus temporal context retrieval resulted in prominent differences in both the spectral and temporal patterns of network interactions. These results emphasize dynamic network interactions as being central to episodic memory retrieval, providing insight into how multiple contexts underlying a single event can be recreated in the same network."
https://openalex.org/W1969205020,"The timing of puberty is controlled by many genes. The elements coordinating this process have not, however, been identified. Here we show that an epigenetic mechanism of transcriptional repression times the initiation of female puberty in rats. We identify silencers of the Polycomb group (PcG) as principal contributors to this mechanism and show that PcG proteins repress Kiss1, a puberty-activating gene. Hypothalamic expression of two key PcG genes, Eed and Cbx7, decreased and methylation of their promoters increased before puberty. Inhibiting DNA methylation blocked both events and resulted in pubertal failure. The pubertal increase in Kiss1 expression was accompanied by EED loss from the Kiss1 promoter and enrichment of histone H3 modifications associated with gene activation. Preventing the eviction of EED from the Kiss1 promoter disrupted pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone release, delayed puberty and compromised fecundity. Our results identify epigenetic silencing as a mechanism underlying the neuroendocrine control of female puberty."
https://openalex.org/W2083272036,"To characterize the role of rare complete human knockouts in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), we identify genes with homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants (defined as nonsense and essential splice sites) from exome sequencing of 933 cases and 869 controls. We identify a 2-fold increase in complete knockouts of autosomal genes with low rates of LoF variation (≤5% frequency) in cases and estimate a 3% contribution to ASD risk by these events, confirming this observation in an independent set of 563 probands and 4,605 controls. Outside the pseudoautosomal regions on the X chromosome, we similarly observe a significant 1.5-fold increase in rare hemizygous knockouts in males, contributing to another 2% of ASDs in males. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence that rare autosomal and X chromosome complete gene knockouts are important inherited risk factors for ASD."

https://openalex.org/W1970338125,"Activities as diverse as migration, proliferation and patterning occur simultaneously and in a coordinated fashion during tissue morphogenesis. In the growing vasculature, the formation of motile, invasive and filopodia-carrying endothelial sprouts is balanced with the stabilization of blood-transporting vessels. Here, we show that sprouting endothelial cells in the retina have high rates of VEGF uptake, VEGF receptor endocytosis and turnover. These internalization processes are opposed by atypical protein kinase C activity in more stable and mature vessels. aPKC phosphorylates Dab2, a clathrin-associated sorting protein that, together with the transmembrane protein ephrin-B2 and the cell polarity regulator PAR-3, enables VEGF receptor endocytosis and downstream signal transduction. Accordingly, VEGF receptor internalization and the angiogenic growth of vascular beds are defective in loss-of-function mice lacking key components of this regulatory pathway. Our work uncovers how vessel growth is dynamically controlled by local VEGF receptor endocytosis and the activity of cell polarity proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2074850059,"The authors show that insulin induces long-term depression of excitatory synapses onto ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons in rodents, which requires endocannabinoid-mediated presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release. Insulin infusion into the VTA reduces food anticipatory behavior and conditioned place preference for food, suggesting a role for this plasticity in behavior. The prevalence of obesity has markedly increased over the past few decades. Exploration of how hunger and satiety signals influence the reward system can help us understand non-homeostatic feeding. Insulin may act in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a critical site for reward-seeking behavior, to suppress feeding. However, the neural mechanisms underlying insulin effects in the VTA remain unknown. We demonstrate that insulin, a circulating catabolic peptide that inhibits feeding, can induce long-term depression (LTD) of mouse excitatory synapses onto VTA dopamine neurons. This effect requires endocannabinoid-mediated presynaptic inhibition of glutamate release. Furthermore, after a sweetened high-fat meal, which elevates endogenous insulin, insulin-induced LTD is occluded. Finally, insulin in the VTA reduces food anticipatory behavior in mice and conditioned place preference for food in rats. Taken together, these results suggest that insulin in the VTA suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission and reduces anticipatory activity and preference for food-related cues."
https://openalex.org/W2156319664,"Many neuropsychiatric symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS) are believed to be a consequence of altered regulation of protein synthesis at synapses. We discovered that lovastatin, a drug that is widely prescribed for the treatment of high cholesterol, can correct excess hippocampal protein synthesis in the mouse model of FXS and can prevent one of the robust functional consequences of increased protein synthesis in FXS, epileptogenesis. These data suggest that lovastatin is potentially disease modifying and could be a viable prophylactic treatment for epileptogenesis in FXS. Many neuropsychiatric symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS) are believed to be a consequence of altered regulation of protein synthesis at synapses.

Autistic disturbances of affective contact.Nervous Child. 1943; 2: 217-250Google Scholar; Tuchman et al., 2010Tuchman R. Cuccaro M. Alessandri M. Autism and epilepsy: historical perspective.Brain Dev. 2010; 32: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and it is now appreciated that approximately 30% of the ASD population have epilepsy. The etiologic heterogeneity of autism and epilepsy have made it difficult to understand the molecular mechanisms linking the two disorders. One approach is to focus on syndromic disorders that have a known genetic etiology and valid animal models. In the current study, we have used a mouse model of fragile X syndrome (FXS), a single-gene developmental disorder characterized by increased incidence of both autism and epilepsy (Berry-Kravis, 2002Berry-Kravis E. Epilepsy in fragile X syndrome.Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 2002; 44: 724-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Musumeci et al., 1999Musumeci S.A. Hagerman R.J. Ferri R. Bosco P. Dalla Bernardina B.

The Fmr1−/y (knockout [KO]) mouse exhibits robust epilepsy phenotypes, both in vitro, as measured by ictal-like discharges in hippocampal slices and neocortical hyperexcitability, and in vivo, as measured by increased susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGS) (Yan et al., 2004Yan Q.J.

A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.Genes Brain Behav. 2004; 3: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The FMR1 gene encodes the translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Pathological changes observed in FXS are believed to stem in part from an elevation of basal protein synthesis downstream of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathway (Bhakar et al., 2012Bhakar A.L. Dölen G. Bear M.F. The pathophysiology of fragile X (and what it teaches us about synapses).Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 417-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 is a key member of the larger MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which is involved in regulation of multiple biochemical processes including the initiation of cap-dependent translation. At the head of this intracellular cascade lies the small GTPase Ras. The Ras/MAPK pathway is a major regulator of cell growth, and thus a strong inhibitor of Ras-ERK1/2 would have deleterious consequences on the developing brain. However, a previous study reported that lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in widespread use for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in both children and adults, could correct cognitive deficits caused by excess Ras activity in the mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (Li et al., 2005Li W. Cui Y. Kushner S.A. Brown R.A. Jentsch J.D. Frankland P.W. Cannon T.D. Silva A.J.

Biol. 2005; 15: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Lovastatin can achieve a mild reduction in Ras-ERK1/2 activation by interfering with the recruitment of Ras to the membrane, a process that is required to transition from the inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound form to the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound form (Kloog et al., 1999Kloog Y.

The interaction of Ras with the membrane requires the posttranslational addition of a farnesyl group to the C terminus and lovastatin inhibits Ras farnesylation by targeting the upstream mevalonate pathway (Figure 1A) (Li et al., 2005Li W.

We therefore wondered whether lovastatin could prevent pathological changes in FXS that lie downstream of excessive ERK-mediated protein synthesis and contribute to epileptogenesis. Unless otherwise stated, we tested lovastatin in male KO and wild-type (WT) mice in the C57BL/6 background. We showed previously that partial inhibition of ERK1/2 was sufficient to restore normal levels of protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F. Hypersensitivity to mGluR5 and ERK1/2 leads to excessive protein synthesis in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether reduction of Ras signaling has the same effect, we used farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS), which dislodges Ras from the membrane (Figure 1A) (Weisz et al., 1999Weisz B. Giehl K. Gana-Weisz M. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Marciano D. Gierschik P. Kloog Y. A new functional Ras antagonist inhibits human pancreatic tumor growth in nude mice.Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hippocampal slices were prepared from juvenile Fmr1 KO and WT mice and preincubated in 25, 50 μM FTS or vehicle for 30 min. Protein synthesis was measured for another 30 min via incorporation of a 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine (35S-Met/Cys) mix. We found that 50 μM FTS reduces protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO down to WT levels (WT versus KO veh ∗p = 0.041, KO veh versus 50 μM FTS ∗p = 0.00002) (Figure 1B). We next asked whether lovastatin could inhibit Ras in our slices as has been shown in other systems. Hippocampal slices were prepared from WT and Fmr1 KO, then incubated with 10–50 μM lovastatin or vehicle. GTP-bound Ras was isolated using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and compared to total Ras. Our results show that 50 μM lovastatin significantly reduces the amount of active Ras in both WT and Fmr1 KO hippocampal slices (WT ∗p = 0.039, KO ∗p = 0.015) (Figure 1C). Western blot analysis revealed that 50 μM lovastatin also significantly reduces ERK1/2 activation in both WT and Fmr1 KO slices (WT ∗p = 0.035, KO ∗p = 0.008) (Figure 1D). To examine the consequence of this modest reduction in ERK1/2 activity on hippocampal protein synthesis, we performed metabolic labeling on WT and Fmr1 KO slices in the presence of 10–50 μM lovastatin. We found that inhibition of the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway by 50 μM lovastatin is sufficient to restore WT levels of protein synthesis in hippocampal slices from the Fmr1 KO (WT versus KO veh ∗p = 0.019, KO veh versus 50 μM ∗p = 0.011) (Figure 1E). Consistent with previous findings, there was no difference in basal levels of Ras and ERK1/2 in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus, suggesting that the excessive protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO is due to a hypersensitivity to, not hyperactivation of, the Ras-ERK1/2 signaling pathway (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F. Hypersensitivity to mGluR5 and ERK1/2 leads to excessive protein synthesis in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To see whether the effects of FTS and lovastatin on protein synthesis might be due to inhibition of the homologous GTPase Rheb instead of Ras (Makovski et al., 2012Makovski V. Haklai R. Kloog Y. Farnesylthiosalicylic acid (salirasib) inhibits Rheb in TSC2-null ELT3 cells: a potential treatment for lymphangioleiomyomatosis.Int. J. Cancer. 2012; 130: 1420-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we measured the phosphorylation (activation) of p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and S6 ribosomal protein (see Supplemental Information available online). We failed to detect changes in these downstream markers of Rheb activity (Figures S1 and S2), suggesting that inhibition of Rheb is not likely to be the mechanism of action for FTS or lovastatin in our preparation. An electrophysiological signature of altered hippocampal protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO mouse is exaggerated long-term synaptic depression (LTD) induced by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F. Altered synaptic plasticity in a mouse model of fragile X mental retardation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 7746-7750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of lovastatin on LTD induced by the mGluR5 agonist 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in hippocampal area CA1 of WT and Fmr1 KO mice. Slices were incubated in vehicle or 50 μM lovastatin, extracellular field potentials were recorded in area CA1 in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation, and mGluR-LTD was induced with a 5 min bath application of 50 μM DHPG with the experimenter blind to genotype and treatment. We found that lovastatin corrects the exaggerated mGluR-LTD observed in the Fmr1 KO to WT levels (WT veh versus KO veh ∗p = 0.005, KO veh versus lova ∗p < 0.001) but had no significant effect on mGluR-LTD in the WT (WT veh versus lova p = 0.869) (Figures 1F and 1G). These electrophysiological findings corroborate the biochemical results and support the conclusion that lovastatin can correct excessive protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO. Previous studies in slices of hippocampal area CA3 have shown that a lasting consequence of mGluR5- and ERK-mediated protein synthesis is the generation of epileptiform activity (Merlin et al., 1998Merlin L.R. Bergold P.J. Wong R.K. Requirement of protein synthesis for group I mGluR-mediated induction of epileptiform discharges.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 989-993PubMed Google Scholar; Zhao et al., 2004Zhao W. Bianchi R. Wang M. Wong R.K. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 is required for the induction of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated epileptiform discharges.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of lovastatin in this model of epileptogenesis. Intracellular recordings were made from CA3 pyramidal cells in WT hippocampal slices ±1 hr preincubation with 50 μM lovastatin. Single-cell behavior and network discharge behavior can be differentiated in these intracellular recordings in that the occurrence, rhythm, and duration of network discharges are not affected by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing the recorded cell (see Taylor et al., 1995Taylor G.W. Merlin L.R. Wong R.K. Synchronized oscillations in hippocampal CA3 neurons induced by metabotropic glutamate receptor activation.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8039-8052PubMed Google Scholar). In control slices, addition of DHPG first elicited short (∼500 ms) synchronized discharges, which gradually extended to reach an average duration of 4.359 ± 0.14 s at 60 min (Figure 2A). Preincubation with 50 μM lovastatin significantly reduced the average duration of synchronized discharges to 0.618 ± 0.03 s at 60 min (∗p = 0.0000218; Figures 2A and 2C). These results suggest that lovastatin is sufficient to block the induction of mGluR-mediated epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices. The epileptiform discharges observed after sustained DHPG application persist after the agonist is removed. This maintenance phase is not affected by inhibition of protein synthesis or ERK1/2, suggesting that translation plays a specific role in epileptogenesis (Zhao et al., 2004Zhao W. Bianchi R. Wang M. Wong R.K. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 is required for the induction of group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated epileptiform discharges.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, exposure of slices to 50 μM lovastatin 60 min after DHPG had no effect on average burst duration (average duration 4.066 ± 0.15 s; p = 0.072; Figures 2B and 2C). These results are consistent with the action of lovastatin as an inhibitor of ERK-mediated protein synthesis (Merlin et al., 1998Merlin L.R. Bergold P.J. Wong R.K. Requirement of protein synthesis for group I mGluR-mediated induction of epileptiform discharges.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 989-993PubMed Google Scholar). In the Fmr1 KO, spontaneous activity is sufficient to elicit epileptiform discharges in hippocampal CA3, suggesting a hypersensitive response to mGluR5-ERK1/2 activation (Chuang et al., 2005Chuang S.C. Zhao W. Bauchwitz R. Yan Q. Bianchi R. Wong R.K. Prolonged epileptiform discharges induced by altered group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic responses in hippocampal slices of a fragile X mouse model.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8048-8055Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike WT slices, which require DHPG to induce ictal discharges, epileptiform activity can be induced in Fmr1 KO slices simply by applying the GABA-A receptor antagonist bicuculline to increase recurrent network activity (Bianchi et al., 2009Bianchi R. Chuang S.C. Zhao W. Young S.R. Wong R.K. Cellular plasticity for group I mGluR-mediated epileptogenesis.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 3497-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Intracellular recordings were therefore performed on bicuculline-treated Fmr1 KO slices ±1 hr preincubation of 50 μM lovastatin. In untreated KO slices, bicuculline elicited short (<1 s) synchronized discharges that increased progressively in duration over the course of 60 min (average duration 2.227 ± 0.13 s at 60 min). This progression was prevented by preincubation in lovastatin (Figures 2D and 2F). The average burst duration of Fmr1 KO slices in lovastatin (0.528 ± 0.01 s at 60 min) was not significantly different from discharges elicited by bicuculline in the WT (0.537 ± 0.01 s; p = 0.995; Figures 2E and 2F). These results show that acute application of lovastatin blocks epileptogenesis in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus. Increased excitability has been observed in the neocortex of the Fmr1 KO. This phenotype is caused by specific changes in excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal membrane excitability and can be rescued by inhibition or reduced expression of mGluR5 (Hays et al., 2011Hays S.A. Huber K.M. Gibson J.R. Altered neocortical rhythmic activity states in Fmr1 KO mice are due to enhanced mGluR5 signaling and involve changes in excitatory circuitry.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 14223-14234Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To investigate whether lovastatin could similarly reduce cortical hyperexcitability, we prepared acute slices from visual cortex and measured persistent activity in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Spiking activity was evoked with electrical stimulation of the underlying white matter every 30 s for a total number of 60 trials in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) plus vehicle, followed by 60 trials in ACSF plus 50 μM lovastatin (Figure 3A). We found that the barrage of action potentials evoked by stimulation of white matter is significantly longer in the Fmr1 KO (Figures 3B and 3C) but is reduced to WT levels by the application of 50 μM lovastatin (Figures 3B and 3C). Analysis of the total number of action potentials evoked revealed a significant dampening effect of lovastatin in Fmr1 KO but not WT slices (WT versus KO veh ∗p = 0.0258, KO veh versus lova ∗p = 0.0001; Figures 3D and 3E). These results suggest that lovastatin corrects the hyperexcitability in the Fmr1 KO visual cortex. We next tested whether lovastatin could ameliorate AGS observed in the Fmr1 KO in vivo. Fmr1 KO and WT mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 30 mg/kg lovastatin and, after 1 hr, exposed to a 130 dB stimulus for 2 min. Four stages of increasing AGS severity were scored: wild running, clonic seizure, tonic seizure, or death (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F. Hypersensitivity to mGluR5 and ERK1/2 leads to excessive protein synthesis in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar; Yan et al., 2004Yan Q.J. Asafo-Adjei P.K. Arnold H.M. Brown R.E. Bauchwitz R.P. A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.Genes Brain Behav. 2004; 3: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Vehicle-treated Fmr1 KO mice exhibited a 74% incidence of AGS, and no seizures were observed in vehicle-treated WT mice (WT versus KO ∗p = 0.0002). Acute injection of lovastatin reduced the incidence of AGS to 28% in the Fmr1 KO (KO veh versus lov ∗p = 0.009) and significantly lessened the severity (Figure 4A). A higher dose of 100 mg/kg lovastatin showed a similar reduction in AGS incidence (KO veh versus lov 85% to 23%; ∗p = 0.005) and severity (KO veh versus lov ∗p = 0.015). To determine whether the effect of lovastatin on AGS susceptibility is independent of the genetic background, we performed another set of experiments using Fmr1 KO mice in the seizure prone FVB strain. Consistent with previous studies, we observed an 85% incidence of AGS in vehicle-treated Fmr1 KO FVB mice (Yan et al., 2004Yan Q.J. Asafo-Adjei P.K. Arnold H.M. Brown R.E. Bauchwitz R.P. A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.Genes Brain Behav. 2004; 3: 337-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which was significantly higher than the 11% incidence observed in vehicle-treated WT mice (∗p = 0.002). Interestingly, Fmr1 KO FVB mice injected with 30 mg/kg lovastatin still exhibit a 64% incidence of AGS incidence, which is not significantly different from the vehicle-treated group (p = 0.357). The severity of AGS is similarly unaffected by this treatment (p = 0.862) (Figure 4B). Previous work has shown that higher doses of mGluR5 inhibitors are required to reduce AGS in Fmr1 KO mice bred on the FVB/NJ background versus the C57BL/6J × FVB/NJ hybrid background (Yan et al., 2005Yan Q.J. Rammal M. Tranfaglia M. Bauchwitz R.P. Suppression of two major Fragile X Syndrome mouse model phenotypes by the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP.Neuropharmacology. 2005; 49: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In addition, a difference in lovastatin metabolism has been observed between different mouse strains (Gegg et al., 2005Gegg M.E. Harry R. Hankey D. Zambarakji H. Pryce G. Baker D. Adamson P. Calder V. Greenwood J. Suppression of autoimmune retinal disease by lovastatin does not require Th2 cytokine induction.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2327-2335PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this literature, we repeated our experiments using a higher dose of lovastatin. The results show that an increased dose of 100 mg/kg lovastatin significantly lowers AGS incidence (KO veh 82%, KO lov 21%, ∗p = 0.005) and reduces AGS severity (KO veh versus lov ∗p = 0.022) in FVB Fmr1 KO mice (Figure 4B). Thus, although the effective dose range differs, lovastatin is effective in correcting AGS in Fmr1 KO mice bred on multiple background strains. For human use, lovastatin is administered as a prodrug in its lactone form, which is metabolized into an active conformation (lovastatin acid) (Lambert et al., 1996Lambert M. Lupien P.J. Gagné C. Lévy E. Blaichman S. Langlois S. Hayden M. Rose V. Clarke J.T. Wolfe B.M. et al.Canadian Lovastatin in Children Study GroupTreatment of familial hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents: effect of lovastatin.Pediatrics. 1996; 97: 619-628PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wished to confirm that lovastatin lactone could also reduce AGS incidence and severity in the Fmr1 KO. Consistent with our previous results, we found that lovastatin lactone (30 mg/kg) significantly reduces AGS incidence from 73% to 20% (∗p = 0.009) and reduces AGS severity (KO veh versus lov ∗p = 0.009) in the Fmr1 KO (Figure 4C). We also wanted to verify that oral administration could similarly correct AGS in the Fmr1 KO. To address this question, we fed WT and Fmr1 KO mice standard rodent chow supplemented with 0.01% lovastatin, which corresponds to a dose of 10 mg/kg/day (Yamada et al., 2000Yamada T. Shinnoh N. Taniwaki T. Ohyagi Y. Asahara H. Horiuchi I. Kira J. Lovastatin does not correct the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in tissues of adrenoleukodystrophy protein-deficient mice.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After a 48 hr exposure to either lovastatin chow or control chow with the same formulation, mice were tested for AGS. Our results show that this oral administration of lovastatin significantly reduces AGS incidence (KO con 71%, KO lov 25%, ∗p = 0.003) and severity (KO veh versus lov ∗p = 0.016) in the Fmr1 KO mouse (Figure 4D). These results suggest that oral administration of pharmaceutical grade lovastatin is effective in correcting AGS susceptibility in the Fmr1 KO. Based on the insights that an ERK1/2 signaling pathway lies upstream of the excessive hippocampal protein synthesis in the Fmr1 KO (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F. Hypersensitivity to mGluR5 and ERK1/2 leads to excessive protein synthesis in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and that lovastatin can, among other actions, inhibit Ras-ERK1/2 signaling in hippocampal neurons (Li et al., 2005Li W. Cui Y. Kushner S.A. Brown R.A. Jentsch J.D. Frankland P.W. Cannon T.D. Silva A.J. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin reverses the learning and attention deficits in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), we wondered whether lovastatin could correct core biochemical and electrophysiological consequences of the loss of the translational repressor FMRP in FXS. We thought this was a particularly exciting prospect because lovastatin is widely prescribed, has a known safety profile, and is approved for use in children (to treat hypercholesterolemia). Our results show that lovastatin can indeed correct excessive protein synthesis and prevent the emergence of epileptiform activity in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus in vitro and can protect the Fmr1 KO mice from AGS in vivo. It has been suggested that seizures in children with developmental disorders such as FXS could worsen the progression and severity of other symptoms including autism (Berry-Kravis, 2002Berry-Kravis E. Epilepsy in fragile X syndrome.Dev. Med. Child Neurol. 2002; 44: 724-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Tuchman et al., 2010Tuchman R. Cuccaro M. Alessandri M. Autism and epilepsy: historical perspective.Brain Dev. 2010; 32: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Once manifest, seizures can be controlled with conventional anticonvulsant medications, but these drugs themselves have side effects that can exacerbate other symptoms, such as cognitive impairment. Further, prodromal changes may be as deleterious for brain development as full-blown seizures. Therefore, preventing epileptogenesis is an important goal. Statins have been studied previously in rodent models of epilepsy in which seizures are initiated or kindled in vivo by administration of drugs or by direct electrical stimulation of the temporal lobes. Some studies have suggested that statins can lessen seizure activity (Lee et al., 2008Lee J.K. Won J.S. Singh A.K. Singh I. Statin inhibits kainic acid-induced seizure and associated inflammation and hippocampal cell death.Neurosci. Lett. 2008; 440: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar; Ramirez et al., 2011Ramirez C. Tercero I. Pineda A. Burgos J.S. Simvastatin is the statin that most efficiently protects against kainate-induced excitotoxicity and memory impairment.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2011; 24: 161-174PubMed Google Scholar; Xie et al., 2011Xie C. Sun J. Qiao W. Lu D. Wei L. Na M. Song Y. Hou X. Lin Z. Administration of simvastatin after kainic acid-induced status epilepticus restrains chronic temporal lobe epilepsy.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e24966Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), whereas others have reported no effect (van Vliet et al., 2011van Vliet E.A. Holtman L. Aronica E. Schmitz L.J. Wadman W.J. Gorter J.A. Atorvastatin treatment during epileptogenesis in a rat model for temporal lobe epilepsy.Epilepsia. 2011; 52: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or an exacerbation of seizures (Serbanescu et al., 2004Serbanescu I. Ryan M.A. Shukla R. Cortez M.A. Snead 3rd, O.C. Cunnane S.C. Lovastatin exacerbates atypical absence seizures with only minimal effects on brain sterols.J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 2038-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Beneficial effects have typically been attributed to reduced brain inflammation associated with seizures. In contrast to previous work, we have used a genetically engineered mouse model of FXS in which seizure phenotypes are not caused by artificial induction of inflammatory responses and neurodegeneration. Our findings point to an entirely different mechanism of action, by which lovastatin corrects multiple Fmr1 KO phenotypes including, but not limited to, in vivo seizure activity by downregulating Ras-ERK1/2 and protein synthesis. It should be noted, however, that the connection between seizure phenotypes in the mouse model and childhood epilepsy in humans with FXS remains to be firmly established. For example, AGS may be largely a reflex event driven by activation of brainstem nuclei with limited relevance to cortical electroencephalographic seizures (Raisinghani and Faingold, 2003Raisinghani M. Faingold C.L. Identification of the requisite brain sites in the neuronal network subserving generalized clonic audiogenic seizures.Brain Res. 2003; 967: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Arguing against this point of view is the observation that audio stimulation rapidly elicits (within 2 min) generalized tonic-clonic seizures in most Fmr1 KO mice, showing that hyperexcitability extends beyond brainstem neurons. Nevertheless, epileptogenesis in fragile X patients is manifest as the appearance of spontaneous seizures, which are not observed in the mouse model. The issue of whether the pathogenesis of epilepsy is shared by mice and humans lacking FMRP could be addressed if the effects of a prophylactic treatment were compared in the two species. Our findings that lovastatin, already approved for use in humans, can prevent epileptogenesis and hyperexcitability in the Fmr1 KO suggest that carefully controlled human clinical trials are warranted. As a negative regulator of the mevalonate pathway, lovastatin can impact the production of multiple compounds involved in intracellular signaling, including ubiquinone, dolichol, and isoprenoids (Goldstein and Brown, 1990Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Regulation of the mevalonate pathway.Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that some beneficial effects of lovastatin could be due to actions other than the reduction in Ras-ERK1/2 signaling, including a reduction in the farnesylation of other target proteins. However, like lovastatin, inhibitors of Ras or ERK1/2 are sufficient to normalize protein synthesis, and downregulation of the ERK1/2 pathway also blocks hippocampal epileptogenesis and eliminates AGS in the Fmr1 KO (Chuang et al., 2005Chuang S.C. Zhao W. Bauchwitz R. Yan Q. Bianchi R. Wong R.K. Prolonged epileptiform discharges induced by altered group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic responses in hippocampal slices of a fragile X mouse model.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8048-8055Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar; Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F. Hypersensitivity to mGluR5 and ERK1/2 leads to excessive protein synthesis in the hippocampus of a mouse model of fragile X syndrome.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15616-15627Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Thus, although the precise molecular mechanisms by which lovastatin confers benefit remain to be determined, the weight of the evidence suggests that the effects are due to a reduction in Ras-ERK1/2 signaling. This study was focused on the seizure phenotype because it has both construct (genotypic) and face (phenotypic) validity with the human disorder (with the caveats raised above). However, previous work has suggested that multiple fragile X symptoms can arise from the same core pathophysiology (Bear et al., 2004Bear M.F. Huber K.M. Warren S.T. The mGluR theory of fragile X mental retardation.Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 370-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar; Bhakar et al., 2012Bhakar A.L. Dölen G. Bear M.F. The pathophysiology of fragile X (and what it teaches us about synapses).Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 417-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The finding that lovastatin normalizes mGluR-LTD in the Fmr1 KO hippocampus to WT levels (Figure 1F) is consistent with this idea. This result is intriguing, however, as protein synthesis inhibitors cannot correct the exaggerated mGluR-LTD in the Fmr1 KO (reviewed in Bhakar et al., 2012Bhakar A.L. Dölen G. Bear M.F. The pathophysiology of fragile X (and what it teaches us about synapses).Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 417-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The implication is that lovastatin is exerting additional beneficial effects on the Fmr1 KO beyond the reduction of protein synthesis. What these effects are remains to be determined; however, it should be noted that the selective reduction of mGluR-LTD in the Fmr1 KO has been observed in a previous study using lithium (Choi et al., 2011Choi C.H. Schoenfeld B.P. Bell A.J. Hinchey P. Kollaros M. Gertner M.J. Woo N.H. Tranfaglia M.R. Bear M.F. Zukin R.S. et al.Pharmacological reversal of synaptic plasticity deficits in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome by group II mGluR antagonist or lithium treatment.Brain Res. 2011; 1380: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to assess in future studies the effect of lovastatin treatment on the full spectrum of fragile X phenotypes. Indeed, the findings that lovastatin can selectively quiet cortical hyperexcitability in the Fmr1 KO (Figure 3) as well as exaggerated LTD suggest it could potentially improve sensory and cognitive functions. Moreover, there is growing appreciation that disruptions in Ras signaling (Krab et al., 2008Krab L.C. Goorden S.M. Elgersma Y. Oncogenes on my mind: ERK and MTOR signaling in cognitive diseases.Trends Genet. 2008; 24: 498-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and synaptic protein synthesis (Kelleher and Bear, 2008Kelleher 3rd, R.J. Bear M.F. The autistic neuron: troubled translation?.Cell. 2008; 135: 401-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) may lie at the core of many autisms of unknown etiology, suggesting that lovastatin could have therapeutic utility in other ASDs as well as in other symptom domains. Fmr1 KO (Jackson Laboratory) and WT littermates, bred on the C57BL/6 or FVB background strains, were group housed and maintained in a 12:12 hr light:dark cycle. All animals were treated in accordance with NIH, MIT, and SUNY guidelines. Experiments were performed on male WT and Fmr1 KO mice (postnatal days 25–32 [P25–P32]), blind to genotype, as described previously (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K.

Immunoblotting was performed blind to genotype and treatment, as described previously (Osterweil et al., 2010Osterweil E.K. Krueger D.D. Reinhold K. Bear M.F.

Slices (four to six per animal) were prepared exactly as for metabolic labeling, and Ras-GTP was isolated using the Active Ras Pull-Down and Detection kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Experiments were performed blind to genotype, as described previously (Huber et al., 2002Huber K.M. Gallagher S.M. Warren S.T. Bear M.F.

Lovastatin (50 μM) was dissolved in vehicle comprising 0.05% DMSO in ACSF. Slices were exposed to drug or vehicle from 30 min prior to application of DHPG until the end of the experiment. Details appear in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Epileptiform activity was elicited using DHPG or bicuculline and intracellular CA3 recordings were performed as previously described (Chuang et al., 2005Chuang S.C. Zhao W. Bauchwitz R. Yan Q.

Slices of visual cortex were prepared from P16–P21 WT or Fmr1 KO animals, blind to genotype, as described previously (Philpot et al., 2001Philpot B.D. Sekhar A.K. Shouval H.Z. Bear M.F.

Submerged slices were maintained at 30°C in a modified ACSF that closely mimics physiological CSF (124 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 vNaHCO3, 10 mM dextrose, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2) and promotes spiking in response to electrical stimulation. Stimulation electrodes (clustered bipolar tungsten, FHC) were positioned in white matter and extracellular recordings were performed in layer 5 using glass recording electrodes (∼1 MΩ). Baseline responses were collected every 30 s, using a stimulus intensity of 35–80 μA, 0.2 ms duration. Responses were collected in ACSF plus vehicle, then ACSF + 50 μM lovastatin. Extracellular recordings made using Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) were amplified 1,000 times, filtered between 0.3 and 3 Hz, and digitized at 25 kHz.

For oral administration experiments, mice were weaned onto standard rodent chow (Bio-serv) formulated with 100 mg/kg IC lovastatin (40 mg tablets, Mylan) or identical chow containing no lovastatin and allowed to feed ad libitum for 48 hr. Immediately prior to testing, mice were transferred to a quiet (<60 dB ambient sound) room for 1 hr, then transferred to a transparent plastic test chamber. After 1 min of habituation, mice were exposed to a 130 dB stimulus (recorded sampling of a modified personal alarm, Radioshack model 49-1010) for 2 min, and the incidence and severity of AGS was scored.

https://openalex.org/W2051694176,"The active centre of the spliceosome consists of an intricate network formed by U5, U2 and U6 small nuclear RNAs, and a pre-messenger-RNA substrate. Prp8, a component of the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, crosslinks extensively with this RNA catalytic core. Here we present the crystal structure of yeast Prp8 (residues 885-2413) in complex with Aar2, a U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle assembly factor. The structure reveals tightly associated domains of Prp8 resembling a bacterial group II intron reverse transcriptase and a type II restriction endonuclease. Suppressors of splice-site mutations, and an intron branch-point crosslink, map to a large cavity formed by the reverse transcriptase thumb, and the endonuclease-like and RNaseH-like domains. This cavity is large enough to accommodate the catalytic core of group II intron RNA. The structure provides crucial insights into the architecture of the spliceosome active site, and reinforces the notion that nuclear pre-mRNA splicing and group II intron splicing have a common origin."
https://openalex.org/W1992323427,"Heymut Omran, Mary Porter and colleagues identify the nexin link–dynein regulatory complex subunit DRC1 from Chlamydomonas and show that mutations in the human DRC1 homolog CCDC164 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia. Their analyses show that loss of DRC1 results in distinct axonemal defects and altered ciliary beat patterns. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is characterized by dysfunction of respiratory cilia and sperm flagella and random determination of visceral asymmetry. Here, we identify the DRC1 subunit of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC), an axonemal structure critical for the regulation of dynein motors, and show that mutations in the gene encoding DRC1, CCDC164, are involved in PCD pathogenesis. Loss-of-function mutations disrupting DRC1 result in severe defects in assembly of the N-DRC structure and defective ciliary movement in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and humans. Our results highlight a role for N-DRC integrity in regulating ciliary beating and provide the first direct evidence that mutations in DRC genes cause human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2129000263,"Craniosynostosis, the premature fusion of the cranial sutures, is a heterogeneous disorder with a prevalence of ∼1 in 2,200 (refs. 1,2). A specific genetic etiology can be identified in ∼21% of cases, including mutations of TWIST1, which encodes a class II basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, and causes Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, typically associated with coronal synostosis. Using exome sequencing, we identified 38 heterozygous TCF12 mutations in 347 samples from unrelated individuals with craniosynostosis. The mutations predominantly occurred in individuals with coronal synostosis and accounted for 32% and 10% of subjects with bilateral and unilateral pathology, respectively. TCF12 encodes one of three class I E proteins that heterodimerize with class II bHLH proteins such as TWIST1. We show that TCF12 and TWIST1 act synergistically in a transactivation assay and that mice doubly heterozygous for loss-of-function mutations in Tcf12 and Twist1 have severe coronal synostosis. Hence, the dosage of TCF12-TWIST1 heterodimers is critical for normal coronal suture development."
https://openalex.org/W1995011038,"The functional contribution of myofibroblasts in fibrosis is not well understood. Using a new genetic mouse model to track and isolate myofibroblasts, we performed gene expression profiling followed by biological validation to identify HE4 (encoding human epididymis protein 4, also known as WAP 4-disulfide core domain-2 or Wfdc2) as the most upregulated gene in fibrosis-associated myofibroblasts. The HE4 gene encodes for a putative serine protease inhibitor that is upregulated in human and mouse fibrotic kidneys and is elevated in the serum of patients with kidney fibrosis. HE4 suppresses the activity of multiple proteases, including serine proteases and matrix metalloproteinases, and specifically inhibits their capacity to degrade type I collagen. In particular, we identified two serine proteases, Prss35 and Prss23, as HE4 targets with functional relevance in kidney fibrosis. Administration of HE4-neutralizing antibodies accelerated collagen I degradation and inhibited fibrosis in three different mouse models of renal disease. Collectively these studies suggest that HE4 is a potential biomarker of renal fibrosis and a new therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2037338364,"Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a tumor suppressor that is dysregulated in a majority of human cancers. Rb functions to inhibit cell cycle progression in part by directly disabling the E2F family of cell cycle-promoting transcription factors. Because the de novo synthesis of multiple glutamine-derived anabolic precursors is required for cell cycle progression, we hypothesized that Rb also may directly regulate proteins involved in glutamine metabolism. We examined glutamine metabolism in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from mice that have triple knock-outs (TKO) of all three Rb family members (Rb-1, Rbl1 and Rbl2) and found that loss of global Rb function caused a marked increase in (13)C-glutamine uptake and incorporation into glutamate and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates in part via upregulated expression of the glutamine transporter ASCT2 and the activity of glutaminase 1 (GLS1). The Rb-controlled transcription factor E2F-3 altered glutamine uptake by direct regulation of ASCT2 mRNA and protein expression, and E2F-3 was observed to associate with the ASCT2 promoter. We next examined the functional consequences of the observed increase in glutamine uptake and utilization and found that glutamine exposure potently increased oxygen consumption, whereas glutamine deprivation selectively decreased ATP concentration in the Rb TKO MEFs but not the wild-type (WT) MEFs. In addition, TKO MEFs exhibited elevated production of glutathione from exogenous glutamine and had increased expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase relative to WT MEFs. Importantly, this metabolic shift towards glutamine utilization was required for the proliferation of Rb TKO MEFs but not for the proliferation of the WT MEFs. Last, addition of the TCA cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate to the Rb TKO MEFs reversed the inhibitory effects of glutamine deprivation on ATP, GSH levels and viability. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the Rb/E2F cascade directly regulates a major energetic and anabolic pathway that is required for neoplastic growth."
https://openalex.org/W2038517366,"Drug addiction is driven, in part, by powerful drug-related memories. Deficits in social life, particularly during adolescence, increase addiction vulnerability. Social isolation in rodents has been used extensively to model the effects of deficient social experience, yet its impact on learning and memory processes underlying addiction remains elusive. Here, we show that social isolation of rats during a critical period of adolescence (postnatal days 21–42) enhances long-term potentiation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated glutamatergic transmission in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This enhancement, which is caused by an increase in metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent Ca2+ signaling, cannot be reversed by subsequent resocialization. Notably, memories of amphetamine- and ethanol-paired contextual stimuli are acquired faster and, once acquired, amphetamine-associated contextual memory is more resistant to extinction in socially isolated rats. We propose that NMDAR plasticity in the VTA may represent a neural substrate by which early life deficits in social experience increase addiction vulnerability."
https://openalex.org/W1986556367,"George Mavrothalassitis, Andrew Wilkie and colleagues report the identification of mutations in ERF that cause a complex craniosynostosis disorder with multiple-suture synostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, Chiari malformation and language delay. They also show that reduced dosage of Erf in mice causes craniosynostosis. The extracellular signal–related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are key proteins mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling downstream of RAS: phosphorylation of ERK1/2 leads to nuclear uptake and modulation of multiple targets1. Here, we show that reduced dosage of ERF, which encodes an inhibitory ETS transcription factor directly bound by ERK1/2 (refs. 2,3,4,5,6,7), causes complex craniosynostosis (premature fusion of the cranial sutures) in humans and mice. Features of this newly recognized clinical disorder include multiple-suture synostosis, craniofacial dysmorphism, Chiari malformation and language delay. Mice with functional Erf levels reduced to ∼30% of normal exhibit postnatal multiple-suture synostosis; by contrast, embryonic calvarial development appears mildly delayed. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and high-throughput sequencing, we find that ERF binds preferentially to elements away from promoters that contain RUNX or AP-1 motifs. This work identifies ERF as a novel regulator of osteogenic stimulation by RAS-ERK signaling, potentially by competing with activating ETS factors in multifactor transcriptional complexes."

The authors discuss cognitive neuroscience research on memory and how it might contribute in the courtroom. A recent decision in the United States by the New Jersey Supreme Court has led to improved jury instructions that incorporate psychological research showing that memory does not operate like a video recording.

We also discuss neuroscience research concerning false and imagined memories, misinformation effects and reconsolidation phenomena that may enhance understanding of why memory does not operate like a video recording."
https://openalex.org/W2112338871,"Pharmacological inhibition of Hsp90 is an exciting option for cancer therapy. The clinical efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors is, however, less than expected. Binding of the co-chaperone p23 to Hsp90 and induced overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins Hsp70 and Hsp27 are thought to contribute to this outcome. Herein, we report that the natural product gedunin may provide a new alternative to inactivate the Hsp90 machine. We show that gedunin directly binds to p23 and inactivates it, without overexpression of Hsp27 and relatively modest induction of Hsp70. Using molecular docking and mutational analysis, we mapped the gedunin-binding site on p23. Functional analysis shows that gedunin inhibits the p23 chaperoning activity, blocks its cellular interaction with Hsp90, and interferes with p23-mediated gene regulation. Cell treatment with gedunin leads to cancer cell death by apoptosis through inactivation of p23 and activation of caspase 7, which cleaves p23 at the C terminus. These results provide important insight into the molecular mechanism of action of this promising lead compound."

MicroRNAs have been shown to be important regulators of TLR signaling. In this study, we have found that the stimulation of multiple TLRs rapidly reduced the levels of microRNA-92a (miRNA-92a) and some other members of the miRNA-92a family in macrophages. miR-92a mimics significantly decreased, whereas miR-92a knockdown increased, the activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway and the production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages when stimulated with ligands for TLR4. Furthermore, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4), a kinase that activates JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, was found to be directly targeted by miR-92a. Similar to the effects of the miR-92a mimics, knockdown of MKK4 inhibited the activation of JNK/c-Jun signaling and the production of TNF-α and IL-6. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that TLR-mediated miR-92a reduction feedback enhances TLR-triggered production of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages, thus outlining new mechanisms for fine-tuning the TLR-triggered inflammatory response.

Akira S. The role of pattern-recognition receptors in innate immunity: update on Toll-like receptors.Nat. Immunol. 2010; 11: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (6189) Google Scholar). TLRs trigger a signaling cascade through the MyD88-dependent and/or MyD88-independent signaling pathways, which in turn transmit a series of signaling cascades that leads to the activation of MAPK and NF-κB, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) (3Takeuchi O. Akira S. Pattern recognition receptors and inflammation.Cell. 2010; 140: 805-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5704) Google Scholar). There are three major subfamilies of MAPKs involved in innate immunity: the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK), the p38 MAP kinases, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNK) (4Dong C. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. MAP kinases in the immune response.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). All three MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation of the threonine and tyrosine residues that is mediated by a conserved protein kinase cascade. ERK is activated by the MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), MKK1 and MKK2; the p38 MAP kinases are activated by MKK3 and MKK6; and the JNK pathway is activated by MKK4 and MKK7 (5Liu Y. Shepherd E.G. Nelin L.D. MAPK phosphatases–regulating the immune response.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). These MKKs are further phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase kinase kinases (MKKKs) such as TAK1, TPL-2, and ASK1, which are activated in TLR stimulation (6Symons A. Beinke S. Ley S.C. MAP kinase kinase kinases and innate immunity.Trends Immunol. 2006; 27: 40-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Members of the MAPK family phosphorylate and activate AP-1, a transcription factor, found in the promoters of proinflammatory cytokines and many other genes that are up-regulated in response to TLR ligation.

The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (Map2k4, MKK4) was first identified in a cDNA library from Xenopus laevis embryos (7Yashar B.M. Kelley C. Yee K. Errede B. Zon L.I. Novel members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase activator family in Xenopus laevis.Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 5738-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MKK4 is activated by the majority of MKKKs, such as MEKK, ASK, mixed-lineage kinase (MLK), and TAK (8Raman M. Chen W. Cobb M.H. Differential regulation and properties of MAPKs.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3100-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). The D domain type docking site in the N-terminal region of MKK4 is for binding of the JNK substrates. It was proved that MKK4 preferentially phosphorylates the tyrosine residue of JNKs, which is to be required for optimal JNK activation (9Seger R. Krebs E.G. The MAPK signaling cascade.FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3198) Google Scholar). MKK4 is involved in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. It is an important gene required for viability and embryonic development in mice (10Ganiatsas S. Kwee L. Fujiwara Y. Perkins A. Ikeda T. Labow M.A. Zon L.I. SEK1 deficiency reveals mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade crossregulation and leads to abnormal hepatogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6881-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Studies on the function of MKK4 in the immune system have been mostly carried out on chimeric Sek1−/−Rag2−/− mice and have controversial results. One study showed that these mice had a reduction in thymus size due to a decrease in the population of peripheral T cells (11Nishina H. Bachmann M. Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Kozieradzki I.

Med. 1997; 186: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas another study showed that MKK4 was required for maintenance of a normal peripheral lymphoid compartment, but is not required for primary lymphocyte development (12Swat W. Fujikawa K. Ganiatsas S. Yang D. Xavier R.J. Harris N.L. Davidson L. Ferrini R. Davis R.J. Labow M.A. Flavell R.A. Zon L.I. Alt F.W. SEK1/MKK4 is required for maintenance of a normal peripheral lymphoid compartment but not for lymphocyte development.Immunity. 1998; 8: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In innate immunity, it has been investigated that endogenous macrophage MKK4 is able to transphosphorylate both p46 and p54 JNK isoforms and that both isoforms are phosphorylated in response to stimulation with TNF-α in macrophages (13Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Jarpe M.B. Wynes M.W. Riches D.W. Preferential activation of the p46 isoform of JNK/SAPK in mouse macrophages by TNFα.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 13169-13174Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MKK4 is also involved in CCR7-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation to regulate cell migration in mature dendritic cells (14Iijima N. Yanagawa Y. Clingan J.M. Onoé K. CCR7-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation regulates cell migration in mature dendritic cells.Int. Immunol. 2005; 17: 1201-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, small noncoding RNAs that have recently been shown to act as important regulators of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. They induce gene degradation or suppress translation mainly by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs (15Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). Currently, miRNAs have been found to play key roles in many biological processes, such as cellular development and tumorigenesis (16Bandyopadhyay S. Mitra R. Maulik U. Zhang M.Q. Development of the human cancer microRNA network.Silence. 2010; 1: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17O'Connell R.M. Zhao J.L. Rao D.S. MicroRNA function in myeloid biology.Blood. 2011; 118: 2960-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). An initial study in 2004 indicated that miRNAs such as miR-142a, miR-181a, and miR-223 can control hematopoiesis and regulate the immune responses (18Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs modulate hematopoietic lineage differentiation.Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2785) Google Scholar).

The miRNAs of this cluster can regulate different cellular targets for tumorigenesis or cell development, either in certain combinations with additive effects or individually. Among these, miR-92a has been reported to promote the migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells, partially via suppression of its target gene (CDH1) expression (37Chen Z.L.

Additionally, miR-92a increases cell proliferation by negative regulation of an isoform of the cell cycle regulator p63 (39Manni I. Artuso S. Careccia S. Rizzo M.G. Baserga R. Piaggio G. Sacchi A.

In addition, miR-25, miR-92b, miR-32, miR-363, and miR-367 are members of miR-92a family that have similar seed sequences that may target the same mRNA UTR.

However, whether miR-92a or its family members take part in TLR-induced innate immune response is still unclear. In this study, we first analyzed the expression profile of miR-92a family members in mouse macrophages after TLR activation and demonstrated its possible function in the TLR-triggered immune response. We found that the expression level of miR-92a is the highest among its family members in the macrophages and is down-regulated quickly in macrophages after activation through multiple TLR ligations. miR-92a negatively regulates TLR-triggered inflammatory cytokine production through targeting MKK4 involved in the JNK/c-Jun pathway. We thus for the first time have identified a new positive feedback loop in which TLR-mediated miR-92a reduction functions to regulate the innate inflammatory responses. C57BL/6 mice (5–6 weeks old) were purchased from SIPPR-BK Experimental Animal Ltd. Co. (Shanghai, China). MyD88 knock-out mice were provided by Prof. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). Experiments and animal care were performed according to protocols approved by the Zhejiang University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), and peptidoglycan were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific to MKK4, IκBα, and β-actin and HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies specific to p-JNK, p-c-Jun, JNK, p-ERK1/2, p-p38, and p-p65 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. miR-92a dsRNA mimics and miR-92a ssRNA inhibitors from GenePharma (Shanghai, China) were used for the overexpression and inhibition of miR-92a activity in cells, respectively. The cells mentioned above were transfected with RNAs at a final concentration of 20 nm. Negative control mimics or inhibitors were transfected as matched controls. The MKK4-specific siRNA (mixture) sequences were 5′-GGACUUGAAAGACCUUGGATT-3′ (sense), 5′-UCCAAGGUCUUUCAAGUCCTC-3′ (antisense) and 5′-GCCGUAUAUGGCACCUGAATT-3′ (sense), 5′-UUCAGGUGCCAUAUACGGCTT-3′ (antisense).

HEK293 and RAW 264.7 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. A total of 1 × 104 HEK-293 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates and incubated overnight. jetSI-ENDO transfection reagents (Polyplus-transfection, Illkirch, France) were used for the co-transfection of plasmids and RNAs as we described previously (44Liu Y.

A total of 0.5 ml of 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto each well of 24-well plates and incubated overnight, and then transfected with RNAs using INTERFERin (Polyplus-transfection), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. The wild-type mouse MKK4 3′-UTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by amplifying the mouse MKK4 mRNA 3′-UTR containing two potential binding sites and cloning it into the PGL3-promoter vector (Promega). The MKK4 UTR mutant 1 was generated from the MKK4 3′-UTR by mutating the first one of two potential miR-92a binding sites. The MKK4 UTR mutant 2 was generated from the MKK4 3′-UTR by mutating the second one of two potential miR-92a binding sites. Also, both miR-92a potential binding sites were mutated in the MKK4 UTR mutant vector. HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid, thymidine kinase promoter-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, and the indicated miRNA mimics, inhibitors, or controls (final concentration, 20 nm). After 24 h, the cells were collected for application in the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the Dual-Luciferase reporter assays were done in triplicate within each experiment, and three independent experiments were conducted. For reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time quantitative PCR, using SYBR Green detection chemistry (Takara), was performed on a 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as we described previously (29Liu Y. Chen Q. Song Y.

The U6 small nuclear RNA sequence was: 5′-CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT-3′ (reverse). The relative expression level of miRNA was normalized to that of the internal control U6. The following primers were used: murine β-actin, 5′-AGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCGC-3′ (reverse); murine TNF-α, 5′-CAAAATTCGAGTGACAAGCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGATCCATGCCGTTGGC-3′ (reverse); murine IL-6, 5′-GTTGCCTTCTTGGGACTGATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGTGGTATCCTCTGTGAAGTCT-3′ (reverse); TRIF, 5′-GGTTCACGATCCTGCTCCTGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGGGCCTGAGAACACTCAAG-3′ (reverse); and MKK4, 5′-GA CTGAGAACACACAGCATTGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-cgtccaatttctccaaggtctt-3′ (reverse). Data were normalized to the level of β-actin expression in each sample. After stimulation with LPS at the indicated time points, the cell supernatants were collected and analyzed using ELISA kits (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) supplemented with PMSF (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). The lysates were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes as described previously (46Wang Q.Q. Li H. Oliver T. Glogauer M. Guo J. He Y.W. Integrin β1 regulates phagosome maturation in macrophages through Rac expression.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Detection of proteins was conducted using ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test and analysis of variance using SPSS (version 10.0), with values of p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. We first detected the expression levels of all the miR-92a family members in the primary peritoneal macrophages and found that miR-92a was significantly enriched in macrophages and much more enriched than the other miRNAs in its family. miR-363 and miR-367 were barely detectable in macrophages (Fig. 1A). Then, to investigate the kinetics of miR-92a family induction, primary peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with different TLR ligands, and the expression levels of miR-92a family were evaluated by qRT-PCR. Treatment of primary peritoneal macrophages with TLR4 ligand LPS rapidly induced the up-regulation of miR-155 expression, indicating that the peritoneal macrophages were activated properly (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, LPS reduced the expression of miR-92a at time points from 30 min and also slightly decreased the levels of miR-25 and miR-92b at 60 min, whereas the expression of miR-32 remained almost unchanged. Stimulation with peptidoglycan, a TLR2 ligand, also reduced the expression of miR-92a and miR-92b in macrophages, but had no effect on expression of miR-25 and even induced the expression of miR-32 (Fig. 1D). Poly(I:C), a TLR3 ligand, also reduced the expressions of the miR-92a family members (Fig. 1E). The expression of miR-92a was also decreased with lower concentrations of LPS (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrated that the expression of miR-92a family members including miR-92a, miR-25, and miR-92b decreased after the activation by TLR agonists in macrophages, and among these family members, miR-92a is abundantly expressed in macrophages, suggesting that miR-92a may be involved in the regulation of TLR-triggered response in macrophages. We next investigated the underlying mechanism through which miR-92a was reduced. We used the MyD88-deficient macrophages from MyD88−/− mice and also used TRIF-siRNA to decrease expression of TRIF in macrophages (Fig. 2, B–D). This result suggested that LPS-reduced miR-92a expression was dependent on both MyD88 and TRIF signaling and may be mainly TRIF-dependent as the expression of miR-92a significantly increased after LPS stimulation in TRIF-silenced macrophages. To assess whether miR-92a may be involved in the regulation of innate immune responses to microbial infection, we transfected RAW264.7 cells with miR-92a mimics, inhibitors or their controls, and analyzed the production of proinflammatory cytokines. As shown in Fig. 3A, transfection with miR-92a mimics increased miR-92a expression, whereas the miR-92a inhibitor decreased its expression level. To exclude the possibility that miR-92a could influence cell survival, apoptosis of the cells was detected by propidium iodide/annexin V staining with FACS analysis. Neither overexpression nor inhibition of miR-92a had any effect on cell viability (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, miR-92a overexpression significantly inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-α and IL-6 production at both the mRNA and the protein levels (Fig. 3, C and D). Accordingly, inhibition of miR-92a significantly increased LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-6 production (Fig. 3E). Similarly, overexpression of miR-92a also inhibited the production of the above cytokines in LPS-stimulated primary peritoneal macrophages, whereas inhibition of miR-92a increased the production of these cytokines (Fig. 3F). Taken together, these data indicated that miR-92a may act as a negative regulator of TLR-triggered innate inflammatory response in macrophages by suppressing the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α. After ligand binding, TLRs activate a series of signaling cascades involved in the activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-6) (3Takeuchi O.

Whether (and how) the vibrissal control circuitry changes after birth is unknown, and the relevant premotor circuitry remains poorly characterized. Using a modified rabies virus transsynaptic tracing strategy, we labeled neurons synapsing directly onto vibrissa facial motor neurons (vFMNs). Sources of potential excitatory, inhibitory, and modulatory vFMN premotor neurons, and differences between the premotor circuitry for vFMNs innervating intrinsic versus extrinsic vibrissal muscles were systematically characterized. The emergence of whisking is accompanied by the addition of new sets of bilateral excitatory inputs to vFMNs from neurons in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi). Furthermore, descending axons from the motor cortex directly innervate LPGi premotor neurons. Thus, neural modules that are well suited to facilitate the bilateral coordination and cortical control of whisking are added to the premotor circuitry in parallel with the emergence of this exploratory behavior."

Abnormal low-gamma activity, hypothesized to reflect impaired synchronization, has been evidenced in several brain disorders. Thus, understanding the relations between gamma oscillations, neuronal synchrony and behavior is a major research challenge. We used a brain-machine interface (BMI) to train monkeys to specifically increase low-gamma power in selected sites of motor cortex to move a cursor and obtain a reward. The monkeys learned to robustly generate oscillatory gamma waves, which were accompanied by a dramatic increase of spiking synchrony of highly precise spatiotemporal patterns. The findings link volitional control of LFP oscillations, neuronal synchrony, and the behavioral outcome. Subjects’ ability to directly modulate specific patterns of neuronal synchrony provides a powerful approach for understanding neuronal processing in relation to behavior and for the use of BMIs in a clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2091796012,"Targeting epigenetic mechanisms during initial learning or memory retrieval can lead to persistent memory. Retrieval induces plasticity that may result in reconsolidation of the original memory, in which critical molecular events are needed to stabilize the memory, or extinction, in which new learning during the retrieval trial creates an additional memory that reflects the changed environmental contingencies. A canonical feature of extinction is that the original response is temporarily suppressed, but returns under various conditions. These characteristics have defined whether a given manipulation alters extinction (when persistence does not occur) or reconsolidation (when persistence does occur). A problem arises with these behavioral definitions when considering the potential for persistent memory of extinction. Recent studies have found that epigenetic modulation of memory processes leads to surprisingly robust and persistent extinction. We discuss evidence from behavioral epigenetic approaches that forces a re-evaluation of widely used behavioral definitions of extinction and reconsolidation."
https://openalex.org/W2132193028,"Copper resistance has emerged as an important virulence determinant of microbial pathogens. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, copper resistance is mediated by the copper-responsive repressor CopY, CupA and the copper-effluxing P(1B)-type ATPase CopA. We show here that CupA is a previously uncharacterized cell membrane-anchored Cu(I) chaperone and that a Cu(I) binding-competent, membrane-localized CupA is obligatory for copper resistance. The crystal structures of the soluble domain of CupA and the N-terminal metal-binding domain (MBD) of CopA (CopA(MBD)) reveal isostructural cupredoxin-like folds that each harbor a binuclear Cu(I) cluster unprecedented in bacterial copper trafficking. NMR studies reveal unidirectional Cu(I) transfer from the low-affinity site on the soluble domain of CupA to the high-affinity site of CopA(MBD). However, copper binding by CopA(MBD) is not essential for cellular copper resistance, consistent with a primary role of CupA in cytoplasmic Cu(I) sequestration and/or direct delivery to the transmembrane site of CopA for cellular efflux."
https://openalex.org/W2032335134,"Voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium channels are made of a pore domain (PD) controlled by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). The PD contains the ion permeation pathway and the activation gate located on the intracellular side of the membrane. A large number of small molecules are known to inhibit the PD by acting as open channel blockers. The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is made of two VSDs and lacks the PD. The location of the activation gate in the VSD is unknown and open channel blockers for VSDs have not yet been identified. Here, we describe a class of small molecules which act as open channel blockers on the Hv1 VSD and find that a highly conserved phenylalanine in the charge transfer center of the VSD plays a key role in blocker binding. We then use one of the blockers to show that Hv1 contains two intracellular and allosterically coupled gates."
https://openalex.org/W2046600573,"Caudal-related homeobox 1 (CDX1), an intestinal-specific transcription factor, has been reported to have vital roles in gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM). Although IM is a high-risk factor for gastric cancer (GC), the specific role of CDX1 in GC is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of CDX1 and its functional roles in GC, and its upstream regulatory mechanisms at the microRNA (miRNA) level were further explored. We found that CDX1 is lost in GC when compared with adjacent IM tissues. Gain-of-function studies showed that CDX1 significantly inhibited GC cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, we identified and verified an onco-mir, miR-296-5p, as a direct upstream regulator of CDX1. miR-296-5p overexpression significantly promoted GC cell growth and attenuated the CDX1-induced anti-growth effects by recurring cell cycle distribution and apoptotic status, whereas knockdown of miR-296-5p decreased GC cell growth. Furthermore, we found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation and the subsequent downstream changes in protein levels related to cell cycle and apoptosis partly account for the miR-296-5p-CDX1-induced GC growth promotion. In addition, the detection of miR-296-5p and expression of CDX1 in primary GC tissues and adjacent IM tissues revealed that miR-296-5p is inversely correlated with CDX1, further supporting our in vitro results. Our results showed an anti-growth effect of CDX1 and identified its miRNA regulatory mechanism in GC. The identification of this novel miR-296-5p-CDX1-ERK1/2 axis sheds new light on the understanding of the process from IM to GC and may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC."
https://openalex.org/W1973598302,"Synapses continually replenish their synaptic vesicle (SV) pools while suppressing spontaneous fusion events, thus maintaining a high dynamic range in response to physiological stimuli. The presynaptic protein complexin can both promote and inhibit fusion through interactions between its α-helical domain and the SNARE complex. In addition, complexin's C-terminal half is required for the inhibition of spontaneous fusion in worm, fly, and mouse, although the molecular mechanism remains unexplained. We show here that complexin's C-terminal domain binds lipids through a novel protein motif, permitting complexin to inhibit spontaneous exocytosis in vivo by targeting complexin to SVs. We propose that the SV pool serves as a platform to sequester and position complexin where it can intercept the rapidly assembling SNAREs and control the rate of spontaneous fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2136945089,"Decision making is impacted by uncertainty and risk (i.e., variance). Activity in the orbitofrontal cortex, an area implicated in decision making, covaries with these quantities. However, this activity could reflect the heightened salience of situations in which multiple outcomes-reward and reward omission-are expected. To resolve these accounts, rats were trained to respond to cues predicting 100%, 67%, 33%, or 0% reward. Consistent with prior reports, some orbitofrontal neurons fired differently in anticipation of uncertain (33% and 67%) versus certain (100% and 0%) reward. However, over 90% of these neurons also fired differently prior to 100% versus 0% reward (or baseline) or prior to 33% versus 67% reward. These responses are inconsistent with risk but fit well with the representation of acquired salience linked to the sum of cue-outcome and cue-no-outcome associative strengths. These results expand our understanding of how the orbitofrontal cortex might regulate learning and behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2015957314,"Voltage-gated proton (Hv1) channels are dimers, where each subunit has a separate permeation pathway. However, opening of the two pathways is highly cooperative. It is unclear how Hv1 channels open their permeation pathways, because Hv1 channels lack a classic pore domain. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry, we here detect two conformational changes reported by a fluorophore attached to the voltage sensor S4 in Hv1 channels. The first is voltage dependent and precedes channel opening, with properties consistent with reporting on independent S4 charge movements in the two subunits. The second is less voltage dependent and closely correlates with channel opening. Mutations that reduce dimerization or alter the intersubunit interface affect both the second conformational change and channel opening. These observations suggest that, following an initial S4 charge movement in the two subunits, there is a second, cooperative conformational change, involving interactions between subunits, that opens both pathways in Hv1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W2098776994,"How neurons form synapses within specific layers remains poorly understood. In the Drosophila medulla, neurons target to discrete layers in a precise fashion. Here we demonstrate that the targeting of L3 neurons to a specific layer occurs in two steps. Initially, L3 growth cones project to a common domain in the outer medulla, overlapping with the growth cones of other neurons destined for a different layer through the redundant functions of N-Cadherin (CadN) and Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a). CadN mediates adhesion within the domain and Sema-1a mediates repulsion through Plexin A (PlexA) expressed in an adjacent region. Subsequently, L3 growth cones segregate from the domain into their target layer in part through Sema-1a/PlexA-dependent remodeling. Together, our results and recent studies argue that the early medulla is organized into common domains, comprising processes bound for different layers, and that discrete layers later emerge through successive interactions between processes within domains and developing layers."

Mutations in the neurexin genes are linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Here, we show that the Drosophila homolog of α-Neurexin is critical for fly visual function. Lack of Neurexin leads to significantly impaired visual function due to reduced rhodopsin levels. We show that the decreased chromophore levels cause deficits in rhodopsin maturation and that Neurexin is required for retinoid transport. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we identify that Neurexin interacts with apolipoprotein I (ApoL I), a product generated by cleavage of retinoid- and fatty acid-binding glycoprotein (RFABG) that functions in retinoid transport. Finally, we demonstrate that Neurexin is essential for the apolipoproteins level. Our results reveal a role for Neurexin in mediating retinoid transport and subsequent rhodopsin maturation and suggest that Neurexin regulates lipoprotein function."
https://openalex.org/W2046200284,"The development of malignant melanoma is a highly complex process, which is still poorly understood. A majority of human melanomas are found to express a few oncogenic proteins, such as mutant RAS and BRAF variants. However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence. This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important point to understand tumor development. Here, we approached the question of senescence evasion by expressing the transcription factor v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYC), which is known to act synergistically with many oncogenes, in melanocytes. We observed that MYC drives the evasion of reactive-oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence. Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive-oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence. We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects. Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CTH in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in the majority of cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H2O2 resistance and soft agar growth. Thus, we identified CTH as new MYC target gene with an important function in senescence evasion."
https://openalex.org/W2103954331,"Distributions of normal strain, shear strain, and strain energy density (SED) were determined across the midshaft of the third metacarpal (MCIII, or cannon bone) of 3 adult thoroughbred horses as a function of speed and gait. A complete characterization of the mechanical demands of the bone made through the stride and from mild through the extremes of locomotion was possible by using three 3-element rosette strain gauges bonded at the diaphyseal midshaft of the MCIII and evaluating the strain output with beam theory and finite element analysis. Mean ± sd values of normal strain, shear strain, and SED increased with speed and peaked during a canter (-3560±380 microstrain, 1760±470 microstrain, and 119±23 kPa, respectively). While the location of these peaks was similar across animals and gaits, the resulting strain distributions across the cortex were consistently nonuniform, establishing between a 73-fold (slow trot) to a 330-fold (canter) disparity between the sites of maximum and minimum SED for each gait cycle. Using strain power density as an estimate of strain history across the bone revealed a 154-fold disparity between peak and minimum at the walk but fell to ~32-fold at the canter. The nonuniform, minimally varying, strain environment suggests either that bone homeostasis is mediated by magnitude-independent mechanical signals or that the duration of stimuli necessary to establish and maintain tissue integrity is relatively brief, and thus the vast majority of strain information is disregarded."

Localizing fluorescent derivatives of FtsZ, Wzd and Wze in dividing bacteria validated the developed tools. The availability of the new plasmids described in this work should greatly facilitate studies of protein localization in an important clinical pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2092527903,"A method for simultaneous humanization and affinity maturation of monoclonal antibodies has been developed using heavy chain complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 grafting combined with somatic hypermutation in vitro. To minimize the amount of murine antibody-derived antibody sequence used during humanization, only the CDR3 region from a murine antibody that recognizes the cytokine hβNGF was grafted into a nonhomologous human germ line V region. The resulting CDR3-grafted HC was paired with a CDR-grafted light chain, displayed on the surface of HEK293 cells, and matured using in vitro somatic hypermutation. A high affinity humanized antibody was derived that was considerably more potent than the parental antibody, possessed a low pm dissociation constant, and demonstrated potent inhibition of hβNGF activity in vitro. The resulting antibody contained half the heavy chain murine donor sequence compared with the same antibody humanized using traditional methods."
