https://openalex.org/W1574128379,"An analytical procedure which affords the precise amino acid composition of a protein or a peptide from a single hydrolysate is described. This method utilizes 4 N methanesulfonic acid containing 0.2% 3-(2-aminoethyl)indole, rather then 6N HCl as a catalyst for hydrolysis. The hydrolysis is carried out in vacuo (20 mu) at 115 degrees for 22 to 72 hours. Half-cystine is determined as S-sulfocysteine by treating the hydrolysate with dithiothreitol followed by an excess of tetrathionate. The values of all amino acids, including tryptophan and half-cystine, were close to the expected theoretical values for the proteins examined. The method has the advantage that the neutralized hydrolysate can be applied directly to an ion exchange column. Further, the method is capable of distinguishing between free sulfhydryl groups as S-carbosymethylcysteine and disulfides as S-sulfocysteine. A limitation of the procedure is that tryptophan remains sensitive to the presence of carbohydrate in the sample."

Immunosuppression not only eliminated mononuclear cell infiltrates in the spinal cord white matter, but it also prevented the occurrence of demyelination. These results suggest that demyelination in this infection is immune-mediated."

The proton-translocating adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) of bovine heart mitochondria was highly purified by extraction of submitochondrial particles with cholate, fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of methanol, deoxycholate, and lysolecithin. 2. The preparation had a very low content of phospholipids, respiratory components, and adenine nucleotide transporter. The ATPase activity (14 o 16 micromoles/min/mg at 30 degrees) was dependent on addition of phospholipids. The purified enzyme was reconstituted with phospholipids, coupling factor 1 (F1), and the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein (OSCP) yielding vesicles with highly active 32Pi-ATP exchange (up to 260 nanomoles/min/mg at 30 degrees), and a proton pump driven by ATP. Site III oxidative phosphorylation was reconstituted when purified cytochrome oxidase was included. 3.The 32Pi-ATP exchange of the reconstituted vesicles was sensitive to both rutamycin and dichylohexylcarbodiimide but the ATPase activity was sensitive to rutamycin and not to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 4. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel scans of the complex, the subunits of F1, OSCP, and three other major bands with apparent molecular weights of 32,000, 23,000, and about 11,000 were noted. Three other minor bands with estimated molecular weights of 80,000, 70,000, and 52,000 were also detected. These bands apparently represent residual trace amounts of respiratory components. Quantitative assays of individual respiratory components revealed between 0 and 3% contamination. 5. We conclude that the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase complex functions as a reversible ATP-driven proton pump."

When injected during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, physostigmine woke the subjects, and when injected during non-REM sleep, it induced REM sleep. This result suggests that cholinergic mechanisms play a role in the induction of REM sleep and in modulating cortical arousal mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1604234143,"Vitamin K is required in an enzymatic reaction which carboxylates glutamyl residues in a microsomal protein precursor of plasma prothrombin to form gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues. The partial requirements of this microsomal, vitamin K-dependent carboxylase system have been determined. A requirement of the system for cytosolic factors appears to be due primarily to the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides or a reduced pyridine nucleotide-generating system in the cytosol. The hydroquinone of vitamin K has been demonstrated to be the enzymatically active form of the vitamin. When vitamin K1 hydroquinone is added to the carboxylase system, no NAD(P)H is needed for maximum activity. The carboxylase activity is half-maximally stimulated by 0.25 mug of vitamin K1/ml in the presence of cytosolic components but requires at least 10 times as much vitamin when microsomes are incubated in a cytosol-free buffer. Menadione is inactive as a vitamin source in this system, and the carboxylase activity is inhibited by the 2-chloro analog of vitamin K1 and by Warfarin. The ATP analog, AMP-P(NH)P, inhibited the carboxylase activity, but a dependence on exogenous ATP or an ATP-generating system could not be demonstrated. Carboxylase activity was found to be dependent on an O2-containing gas phase, and upon the HCO3- concentration."

https://openalex.org/W1519892304,"HDLc, a cholesterol-rich lipoprotein that accumulates in the plasma of cholesterol-fed swine, was shown to resemble functionally human and swine low density lipoprotein in its ability to bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor in monolayers of cultured human fibroblasts. This binding occurred even though HDLc lacked detectable apoprotein B, which is the major protein of low density lipoprotein. After it was bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor, HDLc, like human and swine low density lipoprotein, delivered its cholesterol to the cells, and this, in turn, caused a suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, an activation of the cholesterol-esterifying system, and a net accumulation of free and esterified cholesterol within the cells. Swine HDLc, like human high density lipoprotein, did not bind to the low density lipoprotein receptor nor did it elicit any of the subsequent metabolic events. HDLc, like human low density lipoprotein, was incapable of producing a metabolic effect in fibroblasts derived from a subject with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia, which lack low density lipoprotein receptors. These results indicate that two lipoproteins that have been associated with athersclerosis--low density lipoprotein in humans and HDLc in cholesterol-fed swine--both can cause the accumulation of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters within cells through an interaction with the low density lipoprotein receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1514707656,"Deoxythymidine kinase activities were induced in HeLa TK- (deoxythymidine kinase-deficient) cells infected with either herpes simplex virus type I or herpes simplex virus type II. The herpes simplex virus type I-induced enzyme was found in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the infected cells, whereas the herpes simplex type II-induced deoxythymidine kinase could only be found in the cytoplasm. Herpes simplex virus type I and II specific deoxythymidine kinases were purified by affinity column chromatography. Both purified deoxythymidine kinases retained the deoxycytidine kinase activity present in the crude preparation. The purified herpes simplex virus type I deoxythymidine kinase had a different mobility on electrophoresis, but the same sedimentation rate on a glycerol gradient as the corresponding unpurified enzyme, whereas the purified herpes simplex virus type II deoxythymidine kinase had the same mobility and sedimentation rate as the corresponding unpurified enzyme. In the presence of Mg2+ATP and dithiothreitol, herpes simplex virus type II deoxythymidine kinase was more stable than herpes simplex virus type I deoxythymidine kinase at both 45 degrees and 4 degrees. The deoxycytidine kinase activity present in the purified preparations was inactivated at the same rate as the deoxythymidine kinase activity. In the presence of the other substrate, deoxythymidine, herpes simplex virus type I deoxythymidine kinase was more stable than herpes simplex virus type II kinase. The purified herpes simplex virus type I and II deoxythymidine kinase had different activation energies when Mg2+ATP and deoxythymidine were used as substrates, but showed the same sensitivity toward ammonium sulfate inhibition."

These findings provide direct evidence for an obligatory functional role of a membrane receptor in mediating the action of a polypeptide hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1534938790,"Two distinct ferredosin-type iron-sulfur centers (designated as Centers S-1 and S-2) are present in the soulble succinate dehydrogenase in approximately equivalent concentrations to that of bound flavin. Both Centers S-1 and S-2 exhibit electron paramagnetic resonance absorbance in the reduced state at the same magnetic field (gz = 2.03, gy = 1.93, and gx = 1.91) with similar line shape. Center S-2 is reducible only chemically with dithionite and remains oxidized under physiological conditions. Thus, its functional role is unknown; however, thermodynamic and EPR characterization of this iron-sulfur center has revealed important molecular events related to this dehydrogenase. The midpoint potentials of Centers S-1 and S-2 determined in the soluble succinate dehydrogenase preparations are -5 +/- 15 mV and -400 +/- 15 mV, respectively, while corresponding midpoint potentials determined in particulate preparations, such as succinate-cytochrome c reductase or succinate-ubiquinone reductase, are 0 +/- 15 mV and -260 +/- 15 mV. Reconstitution of soluble succinate dehydrogenase with the cytochrome b-c1 complex is accompanied by a reversion of the Center S-I midpoint from -400 +/- 15 mV to -250 +/- 15 mV with a concomitant restoration of antimycin A-sensitive succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity. There observations indicate that, during the reconstitution process, Center S-I is restored to its original molecular environment. In the reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase, the relaxation time of Center S-2 is much shorter than that of S-1, thus Center S-2 spectra are well discernible only below 20 K (at 1 milliwatt of power), while the resonance absorbance of Center S-1 is detectable at higher temperatures and readily saturates below 15 K. Over a wide temperature range the power saturation of Center S-1 resonance absorbance is relieved by Center S-2 in the paramagnetic state, and the Center S-2 central resonance absorbance is broadened by Center S-1 spins, due to a spin-spin interaction between these centers. These observations indicate an adjacent location of these centers in the enzyme molecule. In reconstitutively inactive enzymes, subtle modification of the enzyme structure appears to shift the temperature dependence of Center S-2 relaxation to the higher temperature. Thus the EPR signals of Center S-2 are also detectable at higher temperature. In this system a splitting of the central peak of the Center S-2 spectrum due to spin-spin interaction was observed at extremely low temperatures, while this was not observed in reconstitutively active enzymes or in paritculate preparations. This spin-spin interaction phenomena of inactive enzymes disappeared upon chemical reactivation with concomitant appearance of the reconstitutive activity. These observations provide a close correlation between the molecular integrity of the enzyme and its physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W1499107965,"In addition to the two species of ferredoxin-type iron-sulfur centers (Centers S-1 and S-2), a third iron-sulfur center (Center S-3), which is paramagnetic in the oxidezed state analogous to the bacterial high potential iron-sulfur protein, has bwen detected in the reconstitutively active soluble succinate dehydrogenase preparation. Midpoint potential (at pH 7.4) of Center S-3 determined in a particulate succinate-cytochrome c reductase is +60 +/- 15 mV. In soluble form, Center S-3 becomes extremely labile towards oxygen or ferricyanide plus phenazine methosulfate similar to reconstitutive activity of the dehydrogenase. Thus, even freshly prepared reconstitutively active enzyme preparations show EPR spectra of Center S-3 which correspond approximately to 0.5 eq per flavin; in particulate preparations this component was found in a 1:1 ratio to flavin. All reconstitutively inactive dehydrogenase preparations that Center S-3 is an innate constituent of succinate dehydrogenase and plays an important role in mediating electrons from the flavoprotein subunit to most probably ubiquinone and then to the cytochrome chain."
https://openalex.org/W1583720349,"Catecholamines increased guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) accumulation by isolated rat liver cells. The increases in cyclic GMP due to 1.5 muM epinephrine, isoproterenol, or phenylephrine were blocked by phenoxybenzamine but not by propranolol. The possibility that cyclic GMP is involved in the glycogenolytic action of catecholamines seems unlikely since cyclic GMP accumulation is also elevated by carbachol, insulin, A23187, and to a lesser extent by glucagon. Furthermore, carbachol had little effect on glycogenolysis while insulin actually inhibited hepatic glycogenolysis. The rise in cyclic GMP due to carbachol was abolished by atropine and that due to all agents was markedly reduced by the omission of extracellular calcium. However, the glycogenolytic action of glucagon and catecholamines was only slightly inhibited by the omission of calcium. The only agent which was unable to stimulate glycogenolysis in calcium-free buffer was the divalent cation ionophore A23187. There was a drop in ATP content of liver cells during incubation in calcium-free buffer which was accompanied by an inhibition of glucagon-activated adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation. The presence of calcium inhibited the rise in adenylate cyclase activity of lysed rat liver cells due to glucagon or isoproterenol but not that due to fluoride. These results suggest that the stimulation by catecholamines and glucagon of glycogenolysis is not mediated through cyclic GMP nor does it depend on the presence of extracellular calcium. Cyclic GMP accumulation was increased in liver cells by agents which either inhibit, have little affect, or accelerate glycogenolysis. The significance of elevations of cyclic GMP in rat liver cells remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W1602114529,"Cell-free extracts from sonically disrupted Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 hydroxylated a variety of 3-oxo-delta4-steroids in position 15beta in the presence of NADPH and O2. Ring A-reduced, aromatic and 3beta-hydroxy-delta5-steroids did not serve as substrates for the 15beta-hydroxylase system. Using ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and gel filtration on Ultrogel ACA-54 it was possible to resolve the hydroxylase system into three proteins: a strictly NADPH-dependent FMN-containing (megaredoxin reductase), an iron-sulfur protein (megaredoxin), and cytochrome P-450 (P-450meg). The activity of the 15beta-hydroxylase system was fully reconstituted upon combination of these three proteins and addition of NADPH. Megaredoxin had an apparent sulfur to iron ration of 0.98 and showed g-signals at 1.90, 1.93, and 2.06 when analyzed by electron paramagnetic reso0 times and the preparation contained 1 to 2 nmol of cytochrome P-450 per mg of protein. This preparation of cytochrome P-450meg sedimented as a homogeneous zone on sucrose gradients with a sedimentation coefficient of 3.3 S and contained 0.94 nmol of heme per nmol of cytochrome P-450. The oxidized form of cytochrome P-450meg showed absolute absorption maxima at 416, 528, and 565 nm whereas the reduced form showed maxima at 411 and 542 nm. The following scheme is suggested for the electron transport in the 15beta-hydroxylase system in B. megaterium: NADPH leads to megaredoxin reductase leads to megaredoxin leads to cytochrome P-450meg."
https://openalex.org/W1501539795,"1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 administration to rachitic chicks results in an increase in the chromatin template activity of intestinal target tissue assayed in vitro using Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The maximum stimulation of template capacity was 12 to 20% over control values and occurred 2 hours after administration of the sterol. This rapid effect preceded the biologic response to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the intestine and was not observed in other tissues such as liver or kidney. The in vivo enhancement of intestinal chromatin template activity was specific for the 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 hormone in that equivalent doses of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or vitamin D3 did not elicit a response in 2 to 3 hours. Only 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, a synthetic sterol which is very rapidly metabolized to the 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 form, was able to minic the natural hormone in vivo. To further elucidate the nuclear mechanism of action of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the hormone was preincubated at 0 degrees with intestinal cytosol to form hormone-receptor complexes. After addition of the hormone-receptor complexes to purified intestinal mucosa nuclei and incubation for 1 hour at 25 degrees, chromatin isolated from this reconstituted system displayed a significant increase in template activity as compared to chromatin prepared from similar in vitro incubations not containing hormone. This stimulation was 12 to 24% over control values and exhibited an absolute requirement for intestinal cell cytosol. The response was specific for physiologic levels of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, but occurred with pharmacologic doses of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. It is concluded that a stimulation of the chromatin template activity of intestinal target tissue by 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 may be an integral part of the ultimate physiologic response of enhanced calcium transport."

https://openalex.org/W1560125983,"The regulation of glycogen metabolism in C-6 astrocytoma and C-1300 neuroblastoma cells in culture has been investigated. Two modes of control of glycogen metabolism appear to be operative. The regulation of intracellular glycogen concentrations and the predominant forms of glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase vary with (a) the available energy supply, and (b) altered intracellular concentration of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). Both cell lines respond to glucose in the medium; when glucose levels are high, glycogen is synthesized, glycogen phosphorylase a decreases, and glycogen synthase a increases. When glucose in the medium decreases to a critical level, the phosphorylase a increases and glycogen concentrations in the cells decrease in aprallel with the medium glucose. The critical glucose concentration is 2.5 mM for the astrocytoma cells and 4 mM for the neuroblastoma cells. Insulin promotes the conversion of phosphorylase to the b form and synthase to the a form in both cell lines. All of these changes occur without alteration in the intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations. When cyclic AMP concentrations are increased in either cell line, phosphorylase a is increased, synthase a is decreased, and glycogen concentrations decrease. Isobutyl methylxanthine is effective in promoting glycogenolysis in both cell lines. Norepinephrine is effective with the astrocytoma cells, and prostaglandin E1 is effective with the neuroblastoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1621315209,"The interaction of CrATP, a stable, substitution-inert, paramagnetic tridentate complex of ATP, with muscle pyruvate kinase has been studied by measuring the effects of CrATP on the kinetics of pyruvate enolization and on the longitudinal nuclear magnetic relaxation rate (1/T1) of the protons of water and the protons and carbon atoms of pyruvate to investigate the existence and activity of bimetallic enzyme-M(II)-CrATP complexes and to determine intersubstrate distances on a kinase. The paramagnetic effect of CrATP on 1/T1 of water protons is enhanced upon complexation with the enzyme. Titrations of the enzyme with CrATP yielded characteristic enhancements of 1/T1 for the binary enzyme-CrATP, ternary enzyme-Mg(II)-crATP, and quaternary enzyme-Mg(II)-crATP-pyruvate complexes of 3.5, 1.7, and 1.2 and dissociation constants of CrATP of 400, 200, and 200 muM, respectively. From the frequency dependence of 1/T1, the number of fast exchanging water protons in the coordination spheres of Cr(III) is approximately 6 in CrATP and in both the ternary enzyme-Mg(II)-CrATP complex and the quaternary enzyme-Mg(II)-CrATP-pyruvate complex. The paramagnetic effect of enzyme-bound Mn(II) on 1/T1 of water protons decreases upon the addition of CrATP. Titration of the binary enzyme-Mn(II) complex with CrATP decreases the characteristic enhancement due to Mn(II) from 24 +/- 3 to 6 +/- 1. Titration of the ternary eznyme-Mn(II)-pyruvate complex with CrATP decreases the enhancement from 6 +/- 1 to 0.5 +/- 0.1. The affinity of the enzyme for Mn(II) is increased 2-fold upon binding of CrATP as indicated by decreases in the amplitude of the EPR spectrum of free Mn(II). The dissociation constants of CrATP from the enzyme-Mn(II)-CrATP complex, the enzyme-CrATP-pyruvate complex, and the enzyme-Mn(II)-CrATP-pyruvate complex are all 200 muM. The observed titration behavior, the characteristic enhancement values, the tightening by Mg(II) of the binding of CrATP to the enzyme, and the tightening of the binding of Mn(II) to the enzyme by CrATP establish the existence of enzyme-M(II)-CrATP and enzyme-M(II)-CrATP-pyruvate complexes containing two cations, Mg(II) or Mn(II) and Cr(III), at the active site."

Glia and muscle cells, but not nerve cells, respond to dopamine with increased cyclic AMP accumulation. This response appears to be mediated through a beta-adrenoreceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1573456108,"Cytochrome c1 has been purified from mitochondria of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The procedure involves solubilization withcholate, ammonium sulfate fractionation, disruption of the dytochrome b-c1 complex with mercaptoethanol and detergents, and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The final product is psectrally pure, contains up to 62 nmol of covalently bound heme per mg of protein and does not react with oxygen or carbon monoxide. Sodium dodecyl sulfate disaggregates the purified cytochrome into a single 31,000 dalton subunit carrying the covalently attached heme group. Many cytochrome c1 preparations contain in addition an 18,500 dalton polypeptide which is devoid of covalently bound heme. Since this polypeptide can be removed from the heme-carrying polypeptide by relatively mild procedures, it is probably not an essential subunit of cytochrome c1. Cytochrome c1 is extremely sensitive to proteolysis. If it si purified in the absence of protease inhibitors, a family of heme polypeptides with molecular weights of 29,000, 27,000, and 25,000 daltons is obtained. In the presence of the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride the purification yields predominantly a 31,000 dalton heme protein with only little contamination by a 29,000 dalton degradation product. In order to show that only the 31,000 dalton heme-polypeptide is the native species, yeast cells were labeled with the heme-precursor delta-amino[3H]levulinic acid, converted to protoplasts and directly lysed with dodecyl sulfate in the presence of protease inhibitors. Subsequent electrophoresis of the lysate in the presence of dodecyl sulfate reveals the covalently bound heme of cytochrome c1 as a single symmetrical peak at 31,000 daltons."

https://openalex.org/W1519791754,"The paramagnetic effects of the bound manganese ion and of a covalently attached spin label on proton nuclear spin relaxation rates have been used to calculate distances for a structural model of the MnADP and creatine complexed to creatine kinase from rabbit muscle. The nucleotide and guanidino substrates are so aligned on the enzyme that the transferable phosphoryl group on one substrate is in apposition to the acceptor moiety on the second substrate. The divalent metal ion is most probably liganded to the alpha and beta phosphates of the nucleotide substrate, both in the abortive MnADP-creatine-enzyme complex and in the active MnATP-creatine-enzyme complex. The metal ion-formate distance approximately 5 A in the Mn(II)ADP-formate-creatine-enzyme complex and less than 5 A in the Co(II)ADP-formate-creatine-enzyme complex is consistent with the suggestion that the monovalent anion is binding at the site normally occupied by the transferable phosphoryl group, thus producing a complex which mimics the transition state. Although only an upper limit of the distance from Mn(II) to the guanidino substrate could be determined in the presence of formate, it could be concluded that the disposition of the guanidino substrate changes upon addition of formate, since the relative distances of the methyl and methylene group are inverted. The effect of formate and nitrate on increasing the residence time of creatine in the MnADP-creatine-enzyme complex as determined by NMR provides evidence that the complexes observed by NMR are identical with those involved in the catalytic mechanism, since a parallel effect of formate and nitrate is observed in the kinetics of the enzymatic reaction, where the dissociation constant of creatine from the abortive quaternary complex decreases in the presence of the anions as had been determined from their inhibition of the forward reaction (Milner-White, E.J., and Watts, D.C. (1971) Biochem. J. 122, 727-740). Although the guanidino substrate is not directly liganded to the divalent metal ion, the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of manganese in the transition state analog complexes, i.e. nitrate-ADP-guanidino substrate-enzyme, is strongly dependent on catalytic activity of the guanidino substrate. The structural differences observed by EPR among transition state analog complexes with various guanidino substrates were not reflected in distances from Mn(II) to the guanidino substrate, which were 10% and 0.3% as active as creatine. Within the experimental error of 1 A, the distances were the same. The enzyme or the enzyme-substrate complexes may be considered to exist in a number of structurally distinct conformations in equilibrium based on the EPR spectra and on the anomalous temperature-dependence of the relaxation rates of the formate proton of the transition state analog complexes..."
https://openalex.org/W1552888715,"Embryonic chick fibroblasts were incubated with [14C]proline and puromycin in the low concentrations of 1 to 3 mug/ml. The molecular weight of the synthesized procollagen chains, as measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, was progressively reduced by increasing concentrations of puromycin in this range. For example, at 3 mug/ml the great majority of the [14C]proline was contained in procollagen chains having an average molecular weight of about 95,000 instead of the control value of 125,000. Associated with this decrease in molecular weight there was a marked decrease in the incorporation of cysteine although [14C]proline incorporation was relatively unaffedted. Disulfide bond formation was drastically inhibited as was triple helix formation as measured by resistance of the procollagen to pepsin digestion. Although the shortened procollagen chains were of normal hydroxyproline content, they nevertheless were secreted much more slowly than normal procollagen. Based upon these findings, we postulate that: (a) low concentrations of puromycin terminate procollagen chains before a COOH-terminal extension is completed, (b) these COOH-terminal extensions are required for normal assembly of the three individual procollagen chains and for triple helix formation, and (c) only assembled, triple helical procollagen molecules are selected for normal secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1574702409,"The conformation of adenosine 5'-triphosphate in the manganese complex of pyruvate kinase from rabbit muscle was determined from six metal to nucleus distances derived by nuclear magnetic relaxation techniques. On the enzyme, no direct metal-ATP coordination exists. The phosphorous atoms of ATP are 4.9 to 5.1 A away from manganese, a distance which indicates either a predominantly (greater than or equal to 94%) second sphere complex or, less likely, a highly distorted inner sphere complex. Thus, water ligands or ligands from the protein might intervene between the ATP molecule and the divalent metal ion and facilitate their interaction. The metal-gammaP distance of 5 A for pyruvate kinase-bound ATP is equal to that found for the phosphorous atom of phosphoenolpyruvate and cobalt(II) on pyruvate kinase (Melamud, E., and Mildvan, A. S. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8193-8201), which is consistent with the overlap in space of the P-enolpyruvate-phosphorus and the gammaP of ATP at the active site. This observation explains the competitive binding of these two substrates to the enzyme, as detected by NMR and by early kinetic studies. From the phosphorus data and from measurements of the relaxation rates of 3 protons of ATP in the pyruvate kinase-metal-ATP complex, the conformation of ATP was characterized as extended with distances of 6.0, 9.1, and 7.5 A from manganese to the H8, H2, and H'1 protons, respectively. The torsion angle about the glycosidic bond (chi) which defines the conformation of the enzyme-bound riboside and adenine rings was determined to be 30 degrees. In contrast, the conformation of the binary Mn(II)-ATP complex in solution is folded around the metal with direct manganese coordination of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-phosphorus atoms, and with metal to proton distances of 4.5, 6.4, and 6.2 A for the H8, H2, and H'1 protons, suggesting a second sphere manganese-adenine interaction. The chi angle equals 90 degrees for the binary complex primarily because of the metal-base interaction. Thus, a profound change in the conformation and structure of Mn(II)-ATP from a folded chelate to an extended second sphere complex results when the nucleotide binds to pyruvate kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1481448169,"The 133,000 X g supernatant fraction prepared from ascites cells in 20 mM KCl (low CKl supernatant) contained the initiation factors EIF-1 and EIF-2 (and the elongation factore EF-1 and EF-2) but lacked EIF-3; thus, low KCl supernatant could be used to assay for EIF-3. EIF-3 was prepared from a crude initiation factor perparation (a 250 mM KCl extract of ascites cell ribosomes precipitated with 70% saturated ammonium sulfate) by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and hydroxylapatite. The EIF-O had no detectable EIF-1 and little or no EIF-2. Factor EIF-3 was required fro translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA. The molecular weight of EIF-3 was estimated by Sephadex G-200 filtration to be 139,000; the sedimentation coefficient was calculated to be about 5.8. EIF-3 formed a binary complex specifically with the initiator tRNA, Met-tRNAf, and if GTP was present the factor formed a ternary complex (EIF-3-Met-tRNAf-GTP). The EIF-3 preparation had no methionyl-tRNA synthetase activity to account for binding. Complex-formation was with eukaryotic Met-tRNAf and no other aminoacyl-tRNA. The binary and ternary complexes were retained quantitatively on Millipore filters (which was the most convenient assay), but they could also be demonstrated by filtration through Sephadex G-100 or by glycerol gradient centrifugation. GTP increased the rate, the amount, and the stability of complex formed; the ration of GTP to Met-tRNAf in the ternary complex appeared to be 1. The binary and the ternary complexes transferred Met-tRNAf to the 40 S ribosomal subunits, but not to 60 S subparticles. The factor-dependent binding of Met-tRNAf to the 40 S subunit did not require mRNA (or GTP). In the presence of 60 S subunits, the initiator tRNA bound to 40 S subunits was not transferred to 80 S ribosomes even if mRNA was added--that reaction may require another initiation factor. Treatment of EIF-3 with N-ethylmaleimide led to loss of its activity in complex formation and in support of the translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA. In addition to forming the binary and ternary complexes, and supporting the translation of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA, EIF-3 also increases the number of free ribosomal subunits by either preventing their association or causing dissociation of 80 S couples."

The amino acid sequence of this respiratory, prokaryotic cytochrome with 134 residues is discussed in relation to those of eukaryotic respiratory cytochrome c (103 to 113 amino acids), and prokaryotic, photosynthetic c2 (103 to 124 amino acids). At the primary structure level, c and c550 differ no more from cytochromes c2 than the various cytochromes c2 do from one another. It is suggested that the respiratory electron transport chain in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is a relatively late evolutionary offshoot of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in purple non-sulfur bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W1550221585,"In the preceding paper (Ross, E., and Schatz, G. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 1991-1996) yeast cytochrome c1 was characterized as a 31,000 dalton polypeptide with a covalently bound heme group. In order to determine the site of translation of this heme-carrying polypeptide, yeast cells were labeled with [H]leu(be under the following conditions: (a) in the absence of inhibitors, (b) in the presence of acriflavin (an inhibitor of mitochondrial translation), or (c) in the presence of cycloheximide (an inhibitor of cytoplasmic translation). The incorporation of radioactivity into the hemeprotein was measured by immunoprecipitating it from mitochondrial extracts and analyzing it by dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Label was incorporated into the cytochrome c1 apoprotein only in the presence of acriflavin or in the absence of inhibitor, but not in the presence of cycloheximide. Cytochrome c1 is thus a cytoplasmic translation product. This conclusion was further supported by the demonstration that a cytolasmic petite mutant lacking mitochondrial protein synthesis still contained holocytochrome c1 that was indistinguishable from cytochrome c1 of wild type yeast with respect to molecular weight, absorption spectru, the presence of a covalently bound heme group, and antigenic properties. Cytochrome c1 in the mitochondria of the cytoplasmic petite mutant is firmly bound to the membrane, and its concentration approaches that typical of wild type mitochondria. However, its lability to proteolysis appeared to be increased. A mitochondrial translation product may thus be necessary for the correct conformation or orientation of cytochrome c1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Accumulation of cytochrome c1 protein in mitochondria is dependent on the abailability of heme. This was shown with a delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase-deficient yeast mutant which lacks heme and any light-absorbing peaks attributable to cytochromes. Mitochondria from mutant cells grown without added delta-aminolevulinic acid contained at least 20 times less protein immunoprecipitable by cytochrome c1-antisera than mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of the heme precursor. Similarly, the respiration-deficient promitochondria of anaerobically grown wild type cells are almost completely devoid of material cross-reacting with cytochrome c1-antisera. A 105,000 X g supernatant of aerobically grown wild type cells contains a 29,000 dalton polypeptide that is precipitated by cytochrome c1-antiserum but not by nonimmune serum. This polypeptide is also present in high speed supernatants from the heme-deficient mutant or from anaerobically gorwn wild type cells. The possible identity of this polypeptide with soluble apocytochrome c1 is being investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1528442868,"The inorganic pyrophosphate-requiring 6-phosphofructokinase of Entamoeba histolytica has been further investigated. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 83,000 and its isoelectric point occurs at pH 5.8 to 6.0. The divalent cation requirement for reaction was explored. In the direction of fructose 6-phosphate formation half-maximal rate required 500 muM magnesium ion; in the direction of fructose bisphosphate formation 8 muM magnesium ion sufficed. ATP, PPi, polyphosphate, acetyl phosphate, or carbamyl phosphate cannot replace PPi as phosphate donor for the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose bisphosphate. In the direction of fructose 6-phosphate formation arsenate can replace orthophosphate. Isotope exchange studies indicate that little or no exchange occurs between Pi and PPi or between fructose 6-phosphate and fructose bisphosphate in the absence of a third substrate. These findings appear to rule out phosphoenzyme formation and a ping-pong reaction mechanism. PPi, Pi, and fructose bisphosphate are competitive inhibitors of fructose bisphosphate, PPi, and fructose 6-phosphate, respectively. This argues against an ordered mechanism and suggests a random mechanism. Fructose 6-phosphate and Pi were noncompetitive with respect to each other indicating the formation of a dead end complex. These product inhibition relationships are in accord with a Random Bi Bi mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1643374090,"The nature of the interaction of glucose with toluene-treated cells of Escherichia coli leading to inhibition of adenylate cyclase was examined by the use of analogues. Those analogues with variations of the substituents about carbon atoms 1 or 2 (e.g. alpha-methylglucoside or 2-deoxyglucose) are inhibitory, and they are also substrates of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system. Analogues with changes in other parts of the molecule (e.g. 3-O-methylglucose or galactose), L-glucose and several disaccharides and pentoses, do not inhibit adenylate cyclase and are not substrates of the phosphotransferase system. This correlation suggests some functional relationship between the adenylate cyclase and phosphotransferase systems. Further studies were done with mutants defective in glucose enzymes II of the phosphotransferase system (designated GPT and MPT); these two activities are measured by phosphorylation of alpha-methyl-glucoside and 2-deoxyglucose, respectively. The wild-type parent phosphorylates both analogues, and both inhibit adenylate cyclase. In the GPT- mutant, alpha-methylglucoside does not inhibit adenylate cyclase and is not phosphorylated, while 2-deoxyglucose is inhibitory and phosphorylated. In the GPT- MPT- double mutant, adenylate cyclase activity is present, but neither alpha-methylglucoside nor 2-deoxyglucose inhibits adenylate cyclase, and neither sugar is phosphorylated. These studies demonstrate that glucose inhibition of adenylate cyclase in toluene-treated cells requires an interaction of this sugar with either the GPT or mpt enzyme II of the phosphotransferase system."

A gene specifying GAPDH is syntenic with the genes specifying the glycolytic enzymes triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) and lactate dehydrogenase B (LDH-B).

https://openalex.org/W1527383937,"Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and water proton relaxation rate (PRR) measurements were used to characterize a complex formed at the myosin subfragment 1 (S1) ATPase site with stoichiometric amounts of Mn(II) and ADP. In the absence of nucleotide, Mn(II) binding at the active site is very weak, although two other classes of sites for Mn(II) on subfragment 1 were identified which are not directly involved in the ATPase reaction. A high affinity Mn(II) site (termed L-site with KL = 3 muM) is associated with a region of the molecule which is susceptible to proteolysis (probably the LC2 light chain subunit) since its stoichiometry depends on the conditions employed for the preparation of subfragment 1 during the papain treatment of myosin. In addition there are a number of weak sites for Mn(II) (termed N-sites) probably associated with anionic groups on the surface of the molecule. In order to study the properties of Mn(II) and ADP bound at the active site by magnetic resonance techniques, subfragment 1 preparations virtually free of the L-site were used, since such an ancillary site competes for the available Mn(II). MnADP binds to subfragment 1 with an apparent dissociation constant, KT, of about 4 muM at 25 degrees. The resultant complex, S1-MnADP, has a low PRR enhancement factor (1.7 at 24.3 MHZ), and its frequency (magnetic field) dependence indicates that this is because there are no readily exchangeable water molecules within the first coordination sphere of Mn(II. Relaxation of the bulk solvent is mediated by protons bound transiently within the outer spheres (4 to 7 A) of the Mn(II). A nitroxide spin label attached to the reactive thiol group of subfragment 1 enhances the solvent PRR, and this property is sensitive to the binding of MgADP to the active site. However, no dipolar spin-spin interaction was detected between the nitroxide group and Mn(II) in the S1-MnADP complex, indicating that the metal ion and thiol group are well separated."

https://openalex.org/W1536764595,"The specific steroid binding capacity of soluble preparations from mouse fibroblasts and rat thymic lymphocytes is inactivated by incubation with phospholipases. Receptor binding is drastically reduced by very low concentrations of boiled phospholipase A preparations from bee venom and snake venoms. The enzyme effect is calcium-dependent and is blocked by both phospholipid and a substrate analog that is a competitive inhibitor of phospholipase A. The specific binding capacity is also sensitive to digestion by phospholipase C. Two possible mechanisms are considered for the phospholipase A effect: (a) the receptor protein may be associated with a phospholipid component which is required for specific hormone binding; (b) phospholipase A may be producing detergent products that are indirectly inactivating the receptor. Examination of the effects of lysophosphatide on the receptor and assay of lipid phosphate in the receptor preparation do not support a mechanism based solely on detergent effects. Because phospholipase C, which does not produce detergent products, also inactivates the binding, we propose that the phospholipases may be digesting the phospholipid which is a requisite component of the glucocorticoid receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1597813488,"Rat adipose tissue glycogen synthase has been kinetically characterized. The classical D form has an apparent Km for UDP-glucose of 0.7 mM and 0.4 mM in the absence and presence of glucose 6-phosphate, respectively. The apparent Ka for glucose 6-phosphate is 0.6 mM. The effect of glucose 6-phosphate on the D form is to enhance the Vmax 7-fold. The I form is also affected by glucose 6-phosphate (Ka, 0.025 mM) but the Vmax is increased only by 20%; apparent Km values for UDP-glucose are 0.4 mM and 0.045 mM in the absence and presence of glucose 6-phosphate, respectively. In addition, two new kinetically distinguishable forms have been observed. The first, designated glycogen synthase Q, arises from an Mg2+ATP-dependent deactivation of the I form. The apparent Km values of glycogen synthase Q for UDP-glucose are identical with those of the I form; however, the apparent Ka for glucose 6-phosphate (0.2 mM) is 8-fold higher than that for the I form and one-third that for the D form. Preparations from fasted or diabetic rats contain a form of glycogen synthase, designated glycogen synthase X, that has a much lower affinity for glucose 6-phosphate than the D form (apparent Ka, 3 mM); the apparent Km values for UDP-glucose are similar to those of the D form (0.7 mM and 0.3 mM in the absence and presence of glucose 6-phosphate, respectively). In preparations from fasted rats a stepwise Mg2+-dependent conversion was demonstrated of synthase X to D to Q to I; this sequential conversion was reversed on incubation with Mg2+ATP. In preparations from fed rats, synthase Q could be generated either by limited activation (from the D form) or, after conversion to the I form, by deactivation with Mg2+ATP. However, even prolonged incubation with Mg2+ATP failed to generate the D (or X) form."

https://openalex.org/W1492342818,"Antibodies which completely inhibited the enzymatic activity of the protein kinase associated with virions of frog virus were obtained by immunization of rabbits with the purified enzyme. This inhibition provided a specific probe for the frog virus protein kinase, since this antiserum had no inhibitory effect on a variety of other protein kinases, including the activity of uninfected cells, or the protein kinase associated with vesicular stomatitis virus or vaccinia virus cultivated in the same cell line as frog virus. The frog virus protein kinase was characterized as a virus-specified protein on the basis of the following observations: (a) the virion protein kinase was antigenically distinct from essentially all of the protein kinase expressed in uninfected cells; (b) following infection by frog virus more than a 15-fold increase was detected in the specific activity of intracellular protein kinase and most of this activity was antigenically related to the virion enzyme; (c) when frog virus was grown in cells derived from widely different species, the antigenic and biochemical specificities of the virion protein kinase remained identical; and (d) screening of cells infected with different temperature-sensitive mutants of frog virus indicated that certain viral mutants failed to synthesize this protein kinase when cultivated at the nonpermissive temperature."
https://openalex.org/W1494738554,"In order to investigate alterations in surface structure in transformed lymphocytes, calf submandibular lymph node cell suspensions were oxidized with NaIO4. Oxidezed lymphocytes were morphologically transformed and had higher rates of DNA synthesis by 2 days after treatment. These results were prevented by reduction of the cell suspension with NaBH4, or by neuraminidase treatment of cells prior to oxidation. The amount of 125I-labeled Agaricus bisporus lectin bound to cells immediately after oxidation and the affinity constant for binding were increased over 2-fold, while cells immediately following oxidation and reduction showed decreased receptors with still higher affinity for the lectin compared to untreated cells. The amount of Phaseolus vulgaris lectin bound to oxidezed cells was also increased, but affinity was unchanged. Immediately following oxidation and reduction, these receptor sites were unchanged in number and affinity from untreated cells. In contrast, the number and affinity of receptors for concanavalin A were not changed immediately after oxidation or oxidation and reduction. In order to define the extent of compositional changes in surface glycoprotein receptors, plasma membranes were isolated from frozen calf submandibular lymph nodes. Compared to untreated plasma membranes, oxidezed membranes had similar contents of galactose, mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and amino acids. Sialic acid content of oxidized membranes was reduced when measured by thiobarbituric acid assay. Sialic acids of untreated plasma membranes co-chromatographed with N-glycolylneurominic acid and N-acetylneuraminic acid, while those of oxidized membranes co-chromatographed with N-glycolylneuraminic acid and 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-L-arabino-7-aldehydo-2-heptulosonic acid. Therefore, specific surface conformational changes in certain classes of membrane glycoproteins are associated with mild Malapradian oxidation of membrane sialic acids. These temporally precede NaIO4-induced transformation of calf lymphocytes. This is consistent with an hypothesis of membrane-mediated stimulation of lymphocyte transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1561087828,"Succinate dehydrogenase is composed of two subunits, one of molecular weight 70,000, containing FAD in covalent linkage to a histidyl residue of the polypeptide chain, the other subunit of molecular weight 30,000. The fact that substrate, substrate analogs, and oxalacetate prevent inactivation of the enzyme by thiol-specific agents indicates that a thiol group must be present in close proximity to the flavin. Comparison of the incorporation of radioactivity into each subunit in the presence and absence of succinate or malonate shows that both substrate and competitive inhibitors protect a sulfhydryl group of the 70,000-molecular weight subunit. This indicates that a thiol group of the flavoprotein subunit is part of the active site. Similar investigations using oxalacetate as a protecting agent indicate that the tight binding of oxalacetate to the deactivated enzyme also occurs in the flavoprotein subunit, and may involve the same thiol group which is protected by succinate from alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide. It is clear, therefore, that not only the flavin site but also an essential thiol residue are located in the 70,000-molecular weight subunit. A second thiol group, located in the 30,000-molecular weight subunit, also binds N-ethylmaleimide covalently under similar conditions, without being part of the active site. Succinate, malonate, and oxalacetate do not influence the binding of this inhibitor to the thiol group of the lower molecular weight subunit. Using maleimide derivatives of nitroxide-type spin labels, it has been possible to demonstrate the presence of two types of thiol groups in the enzyme which form covalent derivatives with the spin probe. When the enzyme is treated with an equimolar quantity of the spin probe, a largely isotropic electron spin resonance spectrum is obtained, indicating a high probe mobility. When this site is first blocked by treating the enzyme with an equimolar quantity of N-ethylmaleimide, followed by an equimolar amount of spin label, the label is strongly immobilized with a splitting of 64 gauss. It is suggested that the sulfhydryl group which is involved in the immobilized species is at the active site."
https://openalex.org/W1561147228,"Acetate kinase of Veillonella alcalescens has been shown to be highly regulated enzyme exhibiting two levels of control: the requirement for succinate as a heterotropic allosteric effector, and cooperative binding at the substrate level. Succinate addition was necessary for enzymatic activity in both the direction of acyl phosphate synthesis and that of ATP synthesis. Control at the substrate level was apparent in the cooperative binding (Hill coefficients of 2) of acetyl phosphate, ATP, and ADP. Typical Michaelis kinetic data were observed for succinate (Ka = 20 mM for acetyl phosphate synthesis, 0.4 mM for ATP synthesis), acetate, and propionate. The primary effect of succinate was to increase the apparent Vmax of the enzymatic reaction for the variable substrates, ATP, ADP, and acetyl phosphate. The results are interpreted as evidence that, as a heterotropic effector of the acetate kinase reaction, succinate may regulate levels of propionyl-CoA (produced from propionyl phosphate by action of phosphotransacetylase), a compound required for the conversion of succinate to propionate. Acetase kinase has been shown to be a probable dimeric protein composed of two subunits of molecular weight 44,000 each."
https://openalex.org/W2020896736,"Addition of choleragen to rat pineal organ cultures caused a long-lasting stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity, and this was followed by increases in seroton N-acetyltransferase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activities. These effects of choleragen were not blocked by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, but the increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase and serotonin N-acetyltransferase activities could be prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The results indicate that cholera toxin can mimic the induction of pineal enzymes that normally follows beta-adrenoceptor activation and suggest that increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a necessary and sufficient signal for such changes in enzyme activity."

The enzyme shows both negative and positive cooperativity with respect to the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (Hill coefficients of 0.5 and 1.75). The enzyme requires a divalent cation for activity. Either magnesium or manganous ion is effective. While magnesium shows normal kinetics, manganous ion shows positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 1.4. The enzyme is activated 50-fold by 0.2 mM NADH at 1 mM phosphoenolpyruvate. This activation is hysteretic, showing a lag of 2 to 3 min. Both NADH and Mn2+ induce a change in the sedimentation coefficient of the enzyme from 12.4 to 8.5 as measured by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. High concentrations of phosphate or sulfate are capable of producing this effect on sedimentation, but neither will activate more than 3-fold. Thus, if NADH is an indicator of the total energy level of the cell, the enzyme appears to be susceptible to control by factors which reflect this total energy level. The importance of this control with respect to hypothetical pathways of carbon utilization in the organism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1563775407,"Bacteria that accumulate RNA in the course of inhibition of protein synthesis are impaired in their ability to synthesize beta-galactosidase during subsequent recovery. By contrast, constitutive enzyme synthesis in recovering cells is normal. Even though no beta-galactosidase is made during recovery from this inhibition, a substantial quantity of beta-galactosidase mRNA (as determined by DNA-RNA hybridization) is made. The beta-galactosidase mRNA made in vivo is functional in vitro. It is capable of directing the in vitro synthesis of a portion of the NH2-terminal beta-galactosidase molecule (in the alpha portion of the molecule). However, this protein is not made in vitro. It is concluded that the beta-galactosidase mRNA that is made during recovery from protein synthesis inhibition, although apparently at least partly normally transcribed in vivo and functional in vitro cannot be translated under these conditions in vivo."
