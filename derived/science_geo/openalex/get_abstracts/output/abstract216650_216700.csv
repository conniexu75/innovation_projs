https://openalex.org/W2008482013,"THE aminolysis of esters has already played a part in early attempts at peptide synthesis, as in the works of E. Fischer1. Fischer recognized that methyl esters react more readily than ethyl esters. Recently, H. Brockmann and H. Musso2 applied methyl esters of amino-acids to the preparation of peptides. The more reactive esters were not used, though the work of M. Gordon, J. G. Miller and A. R. Day3 shows that the speed of aminolysis of vinyl, and especially phenyl, esters of fatty acids is several magnitudes greater than that of the ethyl or methyl esters."
https://openalex.org/W2412261528,"The essential metabolic r61e of manganese in the animal organism has long been a matter of record. It was an early finding that intravenously injected manganous salts are removed quickly from the blood stream (l), leaving the body somewhat less rapidly by way of t,he biliary tract (2). In the course of studies on the kinetics of manganese, our observations led us to surmise the existence in the body of a mechanism whereby the manganese is temporarily diverted in transit, entrapped, and then gradually released. Such a mechanism, with the resulting rapid movement of the element into the entrapping system, would provide an explanation for the lack of agreement noted in previous studies of this metal’s distribution in organs (3-7). The isotope used in this study, Mn 66, has the advantage of being readily available to us in sufficiently high specific activity so that dosages need not exceed levels of normal tolerance. The short half life of this materia.! confined our attention to the early portion of the distribution process, before reabsorption and redistribution of the isotope became a factor to confuse interpretation of the results. From distribution studies in organs, a correlation became apparent between the richness in mitochondria of a given organ and its ability to concentrate manganese. We, therefore, extended our studies to include the mitochondrial uptake of this element in vivo, to determine whether these organelles were a preferential site of manganese accumulation and presumably of its metabolic activity."

Crude preparations of cephalosporin N have been found to show strong absorption in ultra-violet light at 260 mμ, although highly purified cephalosporin N shows very little absorption at this wave-length. A new antibiotic with an absorption maximum at 260 mμ has now been isolated from the crude preparations in the form of a crystalline sodium salt. It resembles cephalosporin N in certain physical, chemical and biological properties, but differs from it sharply in others."

The organism was isolated from soil collected in East Africa by Dr. Philip Spensley. The antibiotic is obtained in good yield from a medium containing inorganic salts, ammonium citrate, glucose and meat extract, both in shallow-layer and it. aerated deep cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2977321282,"IN a recent communication in Nature 1, we pointed out that it has been suggested by several authors that metaphosphate may be a source of ‘high-energy’ phosphate in the cells of a number of lower organisms, but that this had not been proved2. The question has since been investigated in this laboratory."

https://openalex.org/W1992985449,"WE have recently studied the distribution of cholinesterases in the cat's pancreas by Koelle's histochemical method1, and observed that among other structures which contain enzyme the Pacinian corpuscles are prominent. The cholinesterase was seen to be concentrated in the core and stalk of this sensory organ (Fig. 1). By the use of appropriate substrates (acetyl- and butyryl-thiocholine) and a selective inhibitor (diisopropyl-fluoro-phosphate) the enzyme has been identified as pseudocholinesterase. Although the Pacinian corpuscles found in this situation are not pancreatic structures, being part of the enfolding mesentery, their location here is convenient because it is easier to section them when supported by the glandular tissue than when they are lying free in the mesentery."

https://openalex.org/W2520016539,"THERE is no agreement on the connexion which may exist between mast cells and the function of endocrine glands. It is known that the number of mast cells increases during hypothyroidism1 and becomes normal in the hypothyroid subjects treated with thyroxin; it is also known that the number of mast cells in the rat and in the white mouse undergoes, under the influence of cortisone, a considerable increase, particularly in the interlobular connective tissue of the thymus, in the lymph nodes and in the bone-marrow2. A study of the behaviour of mast cells during other modifications of the endocrine equilibrium should thus be opportune."

https://openalex.org/W1999526241,"β-AMYLASE has so far been considered a unique case among hydrolytic enzymes, as its action is accompanied by an inversion of the anomeric configuration of the splitting product produced; that is, β-maltose is formed from amylose, contrary to expectation. From our experiments it seems that two more glycosidases exist capable of analogous anomeric inversions."

https://openalex.org/W1996896036,"DURING the course of investigations into myxomatosis on the Heisker or Monach Isles, North Uist, it was suspected that the rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi (Dale), was responsible for the carry-over of the disease during the winter of 1952–53. Laboratory experiments confirmed that the rabbit flea could transmit the disease, and this was also shown by Lockley1. Since December 1953 a census of the flea population on wild rabbits has been carried out on an estate near Aberdeen, and the accompanying histogram (Fig. 1) illustrates the results."

https://openalex.org/W2022402521,"KOEPSELL et al. 1 have shown recently that oligosaccharides are formed when the dextransucrase of Leuconostoc mesenteroides (NRRL B-512) acts on sucrose in the presence of certain simple sugars, which serve as chain-initiators. We have observed a similar phenomenon with the dextransucrase and with growing cultures of Betacoccus arabinosaceous (Birmingham strain). When grown on a medium containing sucrose (10 per cent), yeast extract and inorganic salts, this organism produces a dextran in which the principal glucosidic linkages are α-1:6 and the branch points involve positions 1 and 32. Fructose, traces of glucose and a ketose-containing disaccharide can be detected in the medium. The degree of branching in the polysaccharide is dependent, inter alia, on the magnesium content of the medium; dextran samples produced from magnesium-rich and magnesium-deficient media have been proved to have average chain-lengths of 6–7 and 40–50 anhydroglucose units, respectively3."

https://openalex.org/W1988550411,"IT has been known for a long time that both chromatid and chromosomal interference produce similar effects on recombinations recovered in classical genetical (Mendelian) analysis in which single chromatids are sampled. Although deviations from a unitary coincidence are probably due either to chromatid or chromosomal interference, the classical method does not permit one to determine whether one or the other, or both, processes are effective in producing the deviations. It is strange, therefore, that chromosomal interference has been the accepted explanation of non-unitary coincidence since the very beginning of modern genetical analysis. The utility of either hypothesis in the analysis of single-chromatid experiments may be demonstrated by considering the following map: The expected frequency of double-recombinations would be 16.7 × 14.5 × 10−4, or 2.4 per cent, whereas the actual frequency is only 0.9 per cent. The accepted conclusion has been that one cross-over actually interferes with the occurrence of another, the ‘strength’ of this interference being indicated by the coincidence value (in this case, 2.67). The hypothesis of chromatid interference is, however, equally applicable if one supposes that adjacent cross-overs form four-strand double exchanges at a frequency equal to or greater than 72 per cent."

Many authors refer to this control of the cell by the infecting particle; but experimental evidence is very scanty. In infection by coliphage T 2, Cohen1 has shown that infected cells use an alternative metabolic pathway to a greater extent than do normal cells. No definite information is available in mammalian virus infections as to the presence of such metabolic alterations, nor the means by which such changes could be produced."
