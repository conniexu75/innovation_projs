https://openalex.org/W2073516240,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extensive cerebral amyloid deposition. Amyloid deposits associated with damaged neuropil and blood vessels contain abundant fibrils formed by the amyloid β-protein (Aβ). Fibrils, both in vitro and in vivo, are neurotoxic. For this reason, substantial effort has been expended to develop therapeutic approaches to control Aβ production and amyloidogenesis. Achievement of the latter goal is facilitated by a rigorous mechanistic understanding of the fibrillogenesis process. Recently, we discovered a novel intermediate in the pathway of Aβ fibril formation, the amyloid protofibril (Walsh, D. M., Lomakin, A., Benedek, G. B., Condron, M. M., and Teplow, D. B. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22364–22372). We report here results of studies of the assembly, structure, and biological activity of these polymers. We find that protofibrils: 1) are in equilibrium with low molecular weight Aβ (monomeric or dimeric); 2) have a secondary structure characteristic of amyloid fibrils; 3) appear as beaded chains in rotary shadowed preparations examined electron microscopically; 4) give rise to mature amyloid-like fibrils; and 5) affect the normal metabolism of cultured neurons. The implications of these results for the development of therapies for Alzheimer's disease and for our understanding of fibril assembly are discussed.

Neurol. Centr. 1906; 23: 1129-1136Google Scholar). Particular attention has been focused on the role that the amyloid β-protein (Aβ), the primary protein constituent of amyloid deposits, plays in development of AD. Aβ molecules are fibrillogenic and exist in a number of forms in vivo (2Teplow D.B. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1998; 5: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Among those forms found in amyloid deposits, 40 and 42 residue long species (Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42), respectively) are particularly important. Genetic studies of AD have shown that mutations in the gene encoding the precursor of Aβ (the amyloid β-protein precursor (βAPP) gene) (3Chartier-Harlin M.-C. Crawford F. Houlden H.

The phenotypic effects of these mutations show remarkable consistency, they all result in excessive production of Aβ or in an increased Aβ(1–42)/Aβ(1–40) ratio, facilitating amyloid deposition (10Selkoe D.J.

In addition, specific haplotypes and mutations in genes involved in the extracellular transport or cleavage of Aβ are risk factors for AD (12Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E.

In particular, the three-dimensional structure and organization of fibril subunits are unknown, as are the steps involved in assembly of nascent, monomeric Aβ first into nuclei, then into higher order oligomers and polymers. Identification of structural intermediates in the fibrillogenesis process and elucidation of the thermodynamics of the associated conformational changes in, and assembly of, Aβ will facilitate identification of therapeutic targets. Rigorous biophysical studies of fibrillogenesis require well characterized, homogeneous starting peptide preparations, free of pre-existing fibrillar material, particulates, or other types of fibril seeds. In prior studies, synthetic Aβ has been dissolved in water or in organic solvents, then diluted directly into buffer for use (21Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 22Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem.

It has been demonstrated that when synthetic Aβ peptides are resuspended at neutral pH they contain a heterogeneous mixture of different sized species (25Snyder S.W. Ladror U.S. Wade W.S. Wang G.T.

Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). In some cases, attempts to physically “de-seed” stock peptide solutions have been made (21Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). However, in most studies, either no precautions were taken or filtration through 0.2-μm filters, incapable of removing anything other than large aggregates, was used. The use of these solutions complicates data interpretation and precludes the study of the earliest phases of fibrillogenesis in vitro. We recently demonstrated that size exclusion chromatography (SEC) can be used to prepare homogeneous populations of Aβ, termed low molecular weight Aβ (LMW Aβ), which are composed of monomeric or dimeric Aβ molecules (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Using these preparations to study Aβ fibrillogenesis, we discovered and reported the initial characterization of a new fibrillogenesis intermediate, the amyloid protofibril (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). This intermediate was also described independently by Harper et al. (22Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Protofibrils are short, flexible fibrils, generally 4–10 nm in diameter and up to 200 nm in length, as measured by negative staining and electron microscopy. Protofibrils appear transiently during Aβ fibrillogenesis (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 27Harper J.D. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 951-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that protofibrils are precursors of the longer, more rigid, amyloid-type fibrils typically produced in vitro using synthetic peptides (22Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 119-125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). If an analogous fibril maturation mechanism operates in vivo, the protofibril stage could be an important therapeutic focus. This may, in fact, be the case as soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ have been isolated from human AD brain (28Kuo Y.M. Emmerling M.R. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Kasunic T.C. Kirkpatrick J.B. Murdoch G.H. Ball M.J. Roher A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4077-4081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). We report here results of studies which significantly extend our knowledge of protofibril morphology, the kinetics and equilibria of protofibril formation and disappearance, the secondary structure of protofibrils and their LMW Aβ precursors, and the biological activity of protofibrils. Our findings suggest that in developing therapies targeting Aβ toxicity, consideration must be given not only to the effects of mature, amyloid-type fibrils, but also to those of protofibrils, and potentially, protofibril precursors. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were of the highest purity available. Water was double-distilled and deionized using a Milli-Q system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Tissue culture components were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Aβ(1–40) was synthesized and purified in our laboratory as described (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Peptide mass, purity, and quantity were determined by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, analytical high performance liquid chromatography, and quantitative amino acid analysis (AAA). Purified peptides were aliquoted, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C until used. Aβ(1–40) was also obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkington, MA). Estimates of peptide content were provided by each manufacturer. Iodinated Aβ(1–40) (125I-Aβ(1–40); ∼2000 Ci/mmol in 35% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) was generously provided by Dr. Evelyn R. Stimson, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. A Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) was attached either to a Waters 650 Advanced Protein Purification system, consisting of a Waters 650 controller and pump, a Rheodyne 9125 injector, a Waters 484 tunable absorbance detector, and a Waters 745 data module, or to a Beckman 110B solvent delivery system module 406 and System Gold detector module 166. In this work, the term “low molecular weight Aβ” (LMW Aβ) signifies an Aβ species which elutes from a SEC column as a single peak and has a hydrodynamic radius consistent with that of either an extended monomer or a compact dimer (determined by quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy (QLS) to be 1–2 nm) (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). To isolate LMW Aβ, Aβ(1–40) was dissolved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide and sonicated in a Branson 1200 ultrasonic water bath for 10 min, after which 200 μl of this solution were injected into the SEC column. The column was eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm, and 350-μl volume fractions were collected during elution of the LMW Aβ peak. Pre-dissolution of Aβ in either dimethyl sulfoxide or buffer gave essentially the same results with respect to SEC and subsequent QLS and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) analysis, but dimethyl sulfoxide treatment significantly increased the recovery of peptide. Protofibrils were prepared essentially as described (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μg of Aβ(1–40) were dissolved in 100 μl of water, diluted with an equal volume of 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide, then incubated at room temperature for 40–60 h. The yield of protofibrils varied among different peptide lots, but a 1–2-day incubation period generally yielded equivalent amounts of protofibrils and LMW Aβ. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g (measured at tube bottom) for 5 min, then ∼160 μl of the supernate were fractionated by SEC, as described above. This procedure yields a symmetric peak in the void volume of the column (Mr > 30,000 for dextrans) which contained protofibrils and a peak of LMW Aβ in the included volume (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic examination of the assemblies in the void peak have revealed small globular structures ∼5 nm in diameter and rods with lengths up to ∼200 nm. Based on a 4–5-nm diameter rod and a linear density of Aβ molecules of 0.8 nm−1 (29Lomakin A. Chung D.S. Benedek G.B. Kirschner D.A. Teplow D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), the molecular masses of these assemblies would range from ∼25 to 900 kDa. Samples were prepared for electron microscopy (EM) using both negative contrast and rotary shadowing techniques. Preparation of samples for negative contrast was performed as described (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Briefly, sample was applied to a carbon-coated Formvar grid, fixed with a solution of glutaraldehyde, then stained with uranyl acetate. Samples were observed using a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope. For rotary shadowing, casts of samples were prepared essentially as described (30San Antonio J.D. Lander A.D. Karnovsky M.J. Slayter H.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1179-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 100-μl aliquots of protofibril fractions were first diluted in 5 mmimidazole, 50 mm NaCl, to ∼1 ml and then diluted with 2 volumes of freshly distilled glycerol. The resulting solution was sprayed onto newly cleaved mica sheets and rotary shadowed using a Denton vacuum evaporator and a platinum source such that an ∼1 nm thick sheet of platinum was deposited on the mica. Following this treatment, a thin carbon film was deposited on top of the platinum. The replica was floated off on water and picked up with a 400-mesh copper grid and examined using a JEOL 100 CX transmission electron microscope. 400 μg of Aβ(1–40) were dissolved in 20 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, to which was added 10 μl of 125I-Aβ(1–40). This mixture was then diluted with 70 μl of water, 100 μl of 0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide, and then incubated at room temperature for 48–60 h. Following incubation, the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min and 160 μl of supernate fractionated by SEC, as described above. 200-μl aliquots of the LMW Aβ and protofibril fractions were placed in 1-ml sterile Spectra/Por CE DispoDialyzers (Spectrum Scientific, Laguna Hills, CA) and dialyzed with gentle stirring at room temperature versus 20 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. In addition, other aliquots of the SEC fractions were used for negative contrast EM, AAA, and scintillation counting. To ensure that the 125I-Aβ was accurately tracing the cold peptide, all SEC fractions were subjected to scintillation counting and the radiotracer profile compared with the UV chromatogram. Only samples which showed a similar distribution of radiolabel and UV absorbance were used. In order to monitor the release of LMW 125I-Aβ(1–40) from the dialysis bag, 1-ml aliquots of dialysis buffer were removed and counted. The aliquots were returned to the dialysis chamber after counting (normally <5 min after their removal). At the end of the experiment, the bag was removed, counted, and a sample of the contents taken for negative contrast EM. QLS was performed as described previously (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Briefly, measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Langley Ford model 1097 autocorrelator and a Coherent argon ion laser (Model Innova 90-plus) tuned to 514 nm. LMW Aβ and protofibrils were isolated as described above. To avoid interference from dust, QLS tubes were washed in a continual flow of eluent from a Superdex 75 column and LMW Aβ or protofibril material were collected directly into these tubes by displacement (31Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Teplow D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The tubes were then heat-sealed and QLS monitoring begun, usually within 2–5 min of collection. Fibrils were prepared by dissolving 800 μg of Aβ(1–40) in 200 μl of water and then diluting with an equal volume of 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.04% (w/v) sodium azide. This solution was incubated for 5 days at 37 °C, then thoroughly mixed, diluted with an equal volume of water, and an aliquot examined by EM to confirm the presence of mature fibrils. The remaining solution was serially diluted to yield concentrations of approximately 500, 250, 125, 62, 31, and 16 μg/ml in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Standards were used immediately or stored at −20 °C until required. The concentrations of the standards were determined by AAA. Congo red binding was assessed essentially as described by Klunk et al. (32Klunk W.E. Pettegrew J.W. Abraham D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1989; 37: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), but with volumes adjusted to perform the assay in a microtiter plate. Briefly, 225 μl of 20 μm Congo red in 20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m sodium chloride, was added to 25 μl of sample, mixed, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the resulting solutions was then measured at 480 and 540 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermo Max microplate reader. All samples were assessed in triplicate and the amount of Congo red bound (Cb) calculated using the formula Cb (nm) = [(A540/25,295) − (A480/46,306)] × 103. The Cb values shown were obtained after subtraction of Cb values for buffer alone. Thioflavin T (ThT) binding was assessed as described by Naiki and Nakakuki (33Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μl of sample was added to a 1-cm path length cuvette containing 800 μl of water and 1 ml of 100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.5. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 100 μm ThT in water and the solution vortexed briefly. Fluorescence was measured after 90, 100, 110, and 120 s. Measurements were made using a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B Luminescence spectrometer with excitation and emission wavelengths of 446 nm (slit width = 5 nm) and 490 nm (slit width = 10 nm), respectively. Each sample and standard was done in triplicate. Solutions of protofibrils or LMW Aβ isolated by SEC were placed into 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes (Hellma, Forest Hills, NY) and spectra obtained from ∼195–250 nm at room temperature using an Aviv 62A DS spectropolarimeter. Raw data were manipulated by smoothing and subtraction of buffer spectra, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Deconvolution of the resulting spectra was achieved using the program CDANAL (34Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and the Brahms and Brahms reference library (35Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of random coil, α-helix, β-sheet, and β-turn in each sample were determined from the normalized contribution of each secondary structure element function to the observed spectrum following curve fitting. LMW Aβ and protofibrils were prepared by SEC. Briefly, 1 mg of peptide was dissolved in 250 μl of water containing 0.01% (v/v) phenol red, diluted with an equal volume of 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, then incubated at room temperature for 2 days. Solutions were then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min and 400–440 μl of the supernate fractionated on a Superdex 75 column eluted with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 70 mm NaCl, at 0.5 ml/min. The elution solvent was chosen empirically after preliminary experiments showed that 0.05m Tris buffer was toxic to cultured neurons and that LMW Aβ and protofibril yields were unacceptably low in the absence of salt. The Tris/NaCl system produced chromatograms indistinguishable from those seen using 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. In addition, the morphology and hydrodynamic radii of protofibrils prepared by this method were essentially the same as those obtained using 0.05m Tris buffer. Peptides were detected by UV absorbance at 254 nm and 450-μl fractions were collected during elution of the LMW Aβ and protofibril peaks. Fractions used for studies of biological activity were also subjected to AAA and EM. In attempting to produce fibrils, we found that when Aβ(1–40) (from a variety of sources) was dissolved at >1 mg/ml in water, it produced a solution whose pH (<3) could not be adjusted properly with 5 mm Tris buffer. To overcome this problem and facilitate monitoring of the pH under sterile conditions, peptide was suspended initially at ∼3.2 mg/ml in 1 mm NaOH, containing 0.01% (v/v) phenol red. 10 mm NaOH then was added at the empirically determined ratio of 200 μl/mg of peptide. This ratio varied slightly among different peptide lots. Finally, the solution was diluted sequentially with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1.4 m NaCl, and water to give a concentration of ∼1.6 mg/ml Aβ(1–40) in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 70 mm NaCl. These solutions were incubated for 2 days at 37 °C, and then used. This procedure consistently produced solutions of amyloid fibrils which could be sedimented readily by brief centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min) and which were indistinguishable from those formed by incubation in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4. Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared according to Hartley et al. (36Hartley D.M. Kurth M.C. Bjerkness L. Weiss J.H. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1993-2000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, brain cells were isolated from the neocortex of E15-17 rat embryos and plated onto poly-l-lysine coated 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 5% (v/v) bovine calf serum, 10% (v/v) Ham's F-12, HEPES (20 mm),l-glutamine (2 mm), and penicillin-streptomycin (500 units/ml and 500 μg/ml, respectively). Cultures were used 2–4 days after plating. Cell-mediated reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was assessed according to the method of Hansen et al. (37Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated protofibrils or LMW Aβ fractions were mixed with concentrated stock solutions of individual tissue culture components to produce a final solution containing 10 mm glucose, 500 units/ml penicillin, 500 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 mm HEPES, and 26 mm NaCO3, all in 1 × minimal essential medium. Peptide concentrations were determined prior to this supplementation. Fibril standards were prepared in a similar fashion to yield nominal final peptide concentrations of 5, 10, and 15 μm. Cells were incubated either in 50 μl of medium without Aβ or in 50 μl containing fibrillar Aβ, protofibrils, or LMW Aβ. After 2 h, 10 μl of 2.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well and the incubation continued for a further 3 h. Cells were then solubilized in 200 μl of 20% (w/v) SDS in 50% (v/v)N,N′-dimethylformamide, 25 mm HCl, 2% (v/v) glacial acetic acid, pH 4.7, by overnight incubation at 37 °C. Levels of reduced MTT were determined by measuring the difference in absorbance at 595 and 650 nm using a Molecular Devices Thermo Max microplate reader. The effects of treatments were compared with controls by using the one-way analysis of variance Tukey test. No reduction of MTT was observed in fibril controls (even at a concentration of ∼30 μm) in the absence of cells. Previous studies of protofibril morphology utilizing negative staining and EM (26Walsh D.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22364-22372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar), or AFM (22Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T. Chem.

Biol. 1997; 4: 951-959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), required avid macromolecule adherence to the sample support for their success. If certain structures were washed away during preparation of the supports, potentially important species would not be observed. To address this issue, and to further our efforts at understanding the gross morphology of protofibrils, we performed electron microscopic examination of protofibrils prepared by rotatory shadowing. In this procedure, which involves no washing, a thin, uniform film of sample is sprayed onto a mica support from which shadow casts are then generated and examined. Both shadowed and negatively stained protofibrils appeared as flexible rods of length up to ∼200 nm"

Because sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) up-regulated lipogenic genes, investigation was made on the effects of fish oil feeding on SREBPs and sterol regulatory element (SRE)-dependent gene expression in C57BL/6J mice. Three forms of SREBPs, SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2, are expressed in liver, and their truncated mature forms activate transcription of sterol-regulated genes. C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups; the first group was given a high carbohydrate diet, and the other two groups were given a high fat diet (60% of total energy), with the fat in the form of safflower oil or fish oil, for 5 months. Compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding decreased triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in liver. There were no differences in amount of SREBP-1 and -2 in both precursor and mature forms between carbohydrate- and safflower oil-fed mice. However, compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding reduced the amounts of precursor SREBP-1 in membrane fraction by 90% and of mature SREBP-1 in liver nuclei by 57%. Fish oil feeding also reduced precursor SREBP-2 by 65% but did not alter the amount of mature SREBP-2. Compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding decreased liver SREBP-1c mRNA level by 86% but did not alter SERBP-1a mRNA. Consistent with decrease of mature SREBP-1, compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding down-regulated the expression of liver SRE-dependent genes, such as low density lipoprotein receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1. These data suggested that in liver, fish oil feeding down-regulates the mature form of SREBP-1 by decreasing SREBP-1c mRNA expression, with corresponding decreases of mRNAs of cholesterologenic and lipogenic enzymes.

Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1990; 10: 149-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This effect of n-3 fatty acids mainly results from the combined effects of inhibition of lipogenesis and stimulation of fatty acid oxidation in liver (2Rustan A.C. Nossen J.O. Christiansen E.N. Drevon C.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1417-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Halminski M.A. Marsh J.B. Harrison E.H. J. Nutr. 1991; 121: 1554-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has been shown that n-3 fatty acids in vivo or in cell culture inhibited the transcription of genes coding for lipogenesis enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS),1acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), and S14 protein (4Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Pegorier J.-P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, n-3 fatty acids increased the transcription of the regulatory enzymes of fatty acid oxidation, such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid-binding protein, acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, acyl-CoA dehydrogenese, and acyl-CoA oxidase (4Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 83-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Pegorier J.-P. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 1998; 1: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which n-3 fatty acids regulate gene transcription have not yet been clarified, but on the basis of in vitro assays and in comparison with peroxisome proliferators, such as fibrate compounds, it has been suggested that n-3 fatty acids can regulate gene transcription through the activation of a transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α (6Reddy J.K. Mannaerts G.P. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 343-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 7Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys.

In addition, a recent study to examine fish oil feeding on several genes expression in PPAR knockout mice clearly indicated that hepatic gene regulation of fish oil feeding involved at least two distinct pathways, a PPARα-dependent and a PPARα-independent pathway (10Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, enzymes for peroxisomal (cytochrome P450 4A2) and microsomal (acyl-CoA oxidase) oxidation are PPARα-dependent and are up-regulated, whereas enzymes for lipid synthesis (FAS and S14) are PPARα-independent and are downregulated (10Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). On the other hand, sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are other important transcription factors that regulate fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism in liver (11Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In sterol depletion, SREBPs are cleaved and become mature forms to bind sterol regulatory elements (SREs) (12Briggs M.R. Yokoyama C. Wang X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14490-14496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and then activate the target gene expression. Thus, both expression levels and processing of SREBPs regulate the target gene expression. Furthermore, three forms of SREBPs, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2, are expressed in liver, and they use different promoters for their own expression (15Hua X. Wu J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1995; 25: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Miserez A.R. Cao G. Probst L.C. Hobbs H.H. Genomics. 1997; 40: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition, studies on transgenic mice that over-expressed SREBP-1a (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), SERBP-1c (18Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in liver demonstrated that they have different potencies for regulation of target gene expression. The target genes of SREBPs involved in cholesterol metabolism include LDL receptor, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, and SREBP itself (17Shimano H. Horton J.D.

Our experiment demonstrated that in liver, fish oil feeding decreased SREBP-1c gene expression and resulted in decrease of mature SREBP-1 protein. These data provide a new mechanism for down-regulation of mRNAs of cholesterologenic and lipogenic enzymes observed in fish oil feeding. Female C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Tokyo Laboratory Animals Science Co. (Tokyo, Japan) at 7 weeks of age and fed a normal laboratory diet (CE2, Clea, Tokyo, Japan) for 1 week to stabilize the metabolic conditions. Mice were exposed to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and maintained at a constant temperature of 22 °C. Mice were divided into three groups (n = 13–16 in each group). Each group was divided into three cages, with each cage containing 4–6 mice. The first group was given a high carbohydrate diet that, on a calorie basis, contained 63% carbohydrate, 11% fat, and 26% protein. In the high carbohydrate diet, safflower oil was used as source of fat. The second group was given a safflower oil-rich diet containing 14% carbohydrate, 60% safflower oil, and 26% protein. The third group was given a high fish oil diet containing 14% carbohydrate, 60% fish oil (mainly from tuna), and 26% protein. Fatty acid compositions of dietary oils were measured by gas-liquid chromatography. Safflower oil (high oleic type) contained 46% oleic acid (18:1 n-9) and 45% linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) from total fatty acids; fish oil contained 7% eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) and 24% docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3). The materials and methods of diet preparation and those of estimation of energy intake were the same as those used in our previous studies (20Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Itakura H. Ezaki O. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 1539-1546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 21Tsunoda N. Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Maruyama K. Itakura H. Watanabe H. Goto N. Ezaki O. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 724-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mice were fed each diet for 5 months. At the end of the experiments, animals were anesthetized at about 10:00 a.m. by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (0.08 mg/g of body weight; Nembutal, Abbot, North Chicago, IL). Liver was isolated immediately, weighed, and homogenized in guanidine-thiocyanate, and RNA was prepared by the method described by Chirgwin et al. (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). A part of liver of each mouse was immediately homogenized to obtain membrane fractions and nuclear extracts (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and the other portion of liver was frozen for measurement of triglyceride and cholesterol as described in previously (24Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Itakura H. Kawanaka K. Tabata I. Higuchi M. Tange T. Yamamoto T. Ezaki O. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E37-E45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Female C57BL/6J mice (n = 5; 7 weeks of age) were treated for 2 weeks with fenofibrate (Sigma) mixed in high carbohydrate diet that had the same ingredient used in fish oil diet study. Control mice (n= 5) were fed under the same conditions but in the absence of fenofibrate. Because each mouse consumed approximately 1.5–2.0 g of chow/day, doses of 0.5% (w/w) mixed in diet correspond to 410–550 mg/kg of body weight/day. Mice were fed each diet for 2 weeks. Mice were sacrificed in a method similar to that of the fish oil diet experiment. The cDNA fragments for mouse SREBP-1, SREBP-2, HMG-CoA reductase, HMG-CoA synthase, apoE, and LPL were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from first strand cDNA using mouse liver total RNA. Total RNA from mouse liver was isolated by the method of Chirgwin et al. (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16652) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was prepared using a Superscript II kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) primed with oligo-dT. The polymerase chain reaction primers used were as follows (17Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Polymerase chain reaction was performed with a Tag DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan). Thirty-two cycles of amplification were made by using the following program: 94 °C, 40 s; 68 °C, 1 min; and 72 °C, 2 min. The amplified products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The cDNA probes for rat LDL receptor and rat ACS were kindly provided by Dr. T.

Aliquots of total RNA(10–15 μg) were denatured with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). After transfer and UV cross-linking, RNA blots were stained with methylene blue to locate 28 S and 18 S rRNAs and to ascertain the amount of loaded RNAs (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 187-206Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized with each cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) by a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in hybridization buffer, subsequently washed one time with 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 22 °C, two times for 30 min at 50 °C, and one time for 30 min at 65 °C. The membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Quantitative analysis was performed with an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) and expressed as the intensity of phosphostimulated luminescence. The cDNA fragment specific to either mouse SREBP-1a or SREBP-1c was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from first strand cDNA prepared using mouse liver total RNA. The following primers were used. SREBP-1a: 5′ primer, 5′-TAGTCCGAAGCCGGGTGGGCGCCGGCGCCAT-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GATGTCGTTCAAAACCGCTGTGTGTCCAGTTC-3′ (Table I from Ref. 31Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D.

After linearization of plasmid, antisense RNA was transcribed with [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol) using bacteriophage T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Specific activities of the transcribed RNAs were measured in each experiment and were in the range of 0.8–1.2 × 109 cpm/μg. Aliquots of total RNA(10 μg) from mouse liver were subjected to RNase protection assay using a RPA IITM kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). After digestion with RNase A/T1, protected fragments were separated on 8 murea/4.8% polyacylamide gels. The gels were dried and then subjected to autoradiography. Quantitative analysis was performed with an image analyzer (BAS 2000). Pooled liver membranes and nuclear extracts from 5–6 mice of each group were prepared by the method described by Sheng et al. (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The same amount of protein from each fraction was applied to 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond-P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblot analysis was performed by using the ECL Western blotting detection system kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane sheets were first incubated with antibody against SREBP-1 or SREBP-2 for 1 h at 22 °C and then washed several times and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The bands were quantified by scanning with Canon IX-4015 (Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Monoclonal antibodies to SREBP-1 (IgG-2A4) and SREBP-2 (IgG-7D4) were purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from the supernatant of hybridoma cell lines CRL 2121 and CRL 2198, respectively. These cell lines were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Blood samples were obtained by cutting the tail end under feeding conditions. Triglyceride concentrations were measured by enzyme assays, determiner LTG (Kyowa Medics, Tokyo, Japan) and cholesterol by determiner LTC (Kyowa Medics). Comparisons of data from multiple groups were made by one-way analysis of variance. When they were significant, each group was compared with the others by Fisher's protected least significant difference test (Statview 4.0, Abacus Concepts). Comparisons of data from two experimental groups were made by unpaired Student's t test. Statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. Values are mean ± S.E. The phenotypic comparison of mice fed three different diets for 5 months is summarized in Table I. In agreement with our previous data (20Ikemoto S. Takahashi M. Tsunoda N. Maruyama K. Itakura H.

In contrast, fish oil-fed mice did not develop obesity or triglyceride accumulation in liver. However, the average energy intake among these three groups was not significantly different (7.4 ± 0.5, 7.7 ± 0.9, and 8.0 ± 0.5 kcal/mouse/day in carbohydrate, safflower oil, and fish oil-fed mice, respectively; n = 5). Fish oil feeding also affected lipid metabolism. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations from fish oil-fed mice were lower by 35% (p < 0.05) and 62% (p < 0.001), respectively, than those from safflower oil-fed mice. Plasma cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations from fish oil-fed mice were also lower by 32% (p < 0.001) and 36% (p = 0.19), respectively, than those from safflower oil-fed mice. Liver weight from fish oil-fed mice was 25% greater than that from safflower oil-fed mice (p < 0.001). This might be due to the well known effects of fish oil on peroxisomal proliferation (32Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Fig. 1 shows immunoblots of the precursor and mature SREBP-1 and -2 in liver of mice fed high carbohydrate, high safflower oil, and high fish oil diets for 5 months. Because antibody to SREBP-1 reacted to both SREBP-1a and -1c forms, we could not distinguish these two forms, and we used the noncommittal term SREBP-1. However, in mouse liver, the ratio of SREBP-1c to -1a transcripts is 9:1 (31Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar), and thus the -1c form accounted for most of SREBP-1 observed on the immunoblots. In preliminary experiments, to confirm that 125- and 68-kDa proteins we observed are really the precursor and mature SREBP-1, fasting and refeeding experiments were conducted. Both precursor and mature SREBP-1 were decreased by 48 h fasting and increased above nonfasted levels by refeeding (data not shown). This confirms not only previous finding (33Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) but also confirms that the bands at which we aimed were SREBP-1. There were no differences in the amount of SREBP-1 and -2 in both precursor and mature forms between carbohydrate- and safflower oil-fed mice. However, compared with safflower oil feeding, fish oil feeding reduced the amount of precursor SREBP-1 in membrane fraction by 90% and that of mature SREBP-1 in liver nuclei by 57% (Fig. 1 A). Fish oil feeding also reduced the precursor SREBP-2 by 65% but did not alter the amount of mature SREBP-2 (Fig. 1 B). In this experiment and others (23Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar,33Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), SREBP bands often appeared as closely spaced doublets, but the reason is not clear. To examine whether a marked decrease of SREBP-1 protein and a moderate decrease of SREBP-2 protein level by fish oil feeding reflected their mRNA levels, SREBP-1 and -2 mRNA levels in liver were measured by Northern blotting (Fig. 2). Parallel to their protein levels, compared with safflower oil-fed mice, fish oil-fed mice showed markedly decreased SREBP-1 mRNA level by 80% (p < 0.001). As for SREBP-2 mRNA, parallel to the amount of its precursor form, it also decreased by 47% in fish oil-fed mice (p < 0.001). The SREBP-1 gene uses two different promoters to produce two different transcripts, -1a and -1c, that differ in the first exon (15Hua X. W"

Studies thus far on this unique peroxidase have primarily focused on its unusual substrate preference for bromide (Br−) and the pseudohalide thiocyanate (SCN−) forming potent hypohalous acids as cytotoxic oxidants. However, the ability of EPO to generate reactive nitrogen species has not yet been reported. We now demonstrate that EPO readily uses nitrite (NO2−), a major end-product of nitric oxide (⋅NO) metabolism, as substrate to generate a reactive intermediate that nitrates protein tyrosyl residues in high yield. EPO-catalyzed nitration of tyrosine occurred more readily than bromination at neutral pH, plasma levels of halides, and pathophysiologically relevant concentrations of NO2−. Furthermore, EPO was significantly more effective than MPO at promoting tyrosine nitration in the presence of plasma levels of halides. Whereas recent studies suggest that MPO can also promote protein nitration through indirect oxidation of NO2− with HOCl, we found no evidence that EPO can indirectly mediate protein nitration by a similar reaction between HOBr and NO2−. EPO-dependent nitration of tyrosine was modulated over a physiologically relevant range of SCN− concentrations and was accompanied by formation of tyrosyl radical addition products (e.g. o,o′-dityrosine, pulcherosine, trityrosine). The potential role of specific antioxidants and nucleophilic scavengers on yields of tyrosine nitration and bromination by EPO are examined. Thus, EPO may contribute to nitrotyrosine formation in inflammatory conditions characterized by recruitment and activation of eosinophils.

Indeed, the respiratory burst of eosinophils generates several times as much superoxide (O⨪2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as a corresponding number of neutrophils (9Slungaard A. Vercellotti G.M.

Despite their known proclivity for producing reactive oxygen species and a wealth of clinical evidence linking eosinophils to host defenses and inflammatory tissue injury, structural identification of specific oxidation products formed by these leukocytes is lacking. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO),1an abundant heme protein secreted from activated eosinophils, plays a central role in oxidant production by eosinophils (1Gleich G.J. Ottesen E.A. Leiferman K.M.

Studies with proteins incubated in the presence of radioactive Br− or SCN− salts and either activated eosinophils or the EPO-H2O2 system have demonstrated covalent incorporation of radiolabel into target proteins (13Weiss S.J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 5660-5668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, structural identification of the oxidation products formed on proteins following exposure to EPO-generated oxidants is essentially unexplored. We recently identified 3-bromotyrosine and 3,5-dibromotyrosine as major products of protein oxidation by the EPO-H2O2-Br− system (21Wu W. Chen Y. d'Avignon A. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The role of brominating oxidants in promoting tissue injury in eosinophilic inflammatory disorders has not yet been established. Another potential pathway for oxidative tissue damage by eosinophils may involve formation of nitrating intermediates by EPO. Immunohistochemical studies using antibodies raised against nitrotyrosine, a global marker for protein damage by reactive nitrogen species, intensely stain eosinophils present in the inflamed lung tissues of asthmatics (22Saleh D. Ernst P. Lim S. Barnes P.J. Giaid A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Klebanoff (23Klebanoff S.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the antimicrobicidal properties of eosinophil peroxidase-H2O2 systems are enhanced in the presence of nitrite (NO2−), the autoxidation product of ⋅NO. Moreover, recent studies have shown that myeloperoxidase (MPO), a neutrophil- and monocyte-specific peroxidase, can use NO2− and H2O2 as substrates to generate a reactive intermediate capable of nitrating phenolic compounds and protein tyrosyl residues (25van der Vleit A.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, MPO and EPO are distinct gene products with divergent physical properties. Although both peroxidases contain heme prosthetic groups, structural studies have established that MPO contains a six-coordinate, high spin chlorin, while EPO possesses a high spin, six-coordinate protoporphyrin (24Sibbett S.S. Klebanoff S.J. Hurst J.K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Moreover, although human MPO is tetrameric and comprised of two heavy and two light chains, EPO is dimeric, having only one heavy and one light chain (7Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 24Sibbett S.S. Klebanoff S.J. Hurst J.K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 189: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whether these structural differences underlie the distinct halide and substrate specificities observed between MPO and EPO remains unknown. Furthermore, although increased levels of NO2− and eosinophils have been reported in a variety of conditions, the ability of EPO to generate nitrating intermediates has not yet been explored. The biological roles and potential targets of mammalian peroxidases are defined by their unique and often nonoverlapping substrate preferences (29Agner K. Akeson A. Ehrenberg A. Structure and Function of Oxidation-Reduction Enzymes. Pergamon Press, Oxford1972: 329-335Google Scholar, 30Klebanoff S.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1980; 93: 480-489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether the EPO-H2O2 system of eosinophils could promote protein oxidative damage through formation of reactive nitrogen species. We now show that isolated EPO readily uses NO2− as substrate to generate a reactive intermediate that nitrates protein tyrosyl residues in high yield. We demonstrate that EPO is more efficient than MPO at nitrating tyrosine and that EPO-dependent protein nitration is a preferred activity of the enzyme. Finally, we provide evidence that EPO also generates tyrosyl radical and that tyrosine nitration by EPO may involve a tyrosyl radical intermediate.

The concentration of the MPO dimer was calculated as half of the indicated concentration of hemelike chromophore. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was performed as described by Laemmli (38Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was measured by the Markwell-modified Lowry assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard (39Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal.

Chem. 1982; 21: 4258-4263Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) as its conjugate base, hypobromite (OBr−), immediately prior to use. The concentration of reagent H2O2(ε240 = 39.4 m−1cm−1) (42Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) was determined spectrophotometrically. Production of H2O2 by the glucose/glucose oxidase system was determined by oxidation of Fe(II) and formation of a Fe(III)-thiocyanate complex (25van der Vleit A. Eiserich J.P. Halliwell B. Cross C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7617-7625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of nitrated proteins was determined as described using immunopurified rabbit polyclonal antibody against nitrotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (43Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Huang Z.Q. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The specificity of the primary antibody was confirmed by blocking immunoreactivity in coincubations with either 10 mm nitrotyrosine or 1 mm of the tripeptide Gly-nitro-Tyr-Ala as described (43Ye Y.Z. Strong M. Huang Z.Q. Beckman J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 269: 201-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). o,o′- Dityrosine, pulcherosine, trityrosine, and isodityrosine were prepared and quantified as described previously (44Jacob J.S. Cistola D.P. Hsu F.F. Muzaffar S. Mueller D.M. Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19950-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). 3-Bromotyrosine and 3,5-dibromotyrosine standards were synthesized froml - tyrosine and isolated by preparative HPLC as recently described (21Wu W. Chen Y. d'Avignon A. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). [13C6]Ring-labeled analogs of 3-bromotyrosine and 3,5-dibromotyrosine were similarly prepared usingl -[13C6]tyrosine as starting material. UV-visible studies on authentic and EPO-generated 3-nitrotyrosine were performed on a λ Bio Spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer). 3-Nitro-[13C6]tyrosine, 3-chloro-[13C6]tyrosine, and o, o′-[13C12]dityrosine standards for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) identification of products were synthesized and quantified as described previously (45Heinecke J.W.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 124-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). 5-Thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) was prepared fresh by reduction of 1 mm DTNB in 100 ml of sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) with 4 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (46Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). EPO (14.2 nm) was then incubated at 37 °C in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) with TNB (53 μm) in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of Br−, SCN−, NO2−, or Cl−. Oxidation of TNB to DTNB was initiated by the addition of H2O2 (30 μm) and followed spectrophotometrically at 412 nm (ε412 = 27,200m−1 cm−1) (46Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, reactions were initiated by the addition of oxidant (H2O2,HOBr or glucose to the glucose/glucose oxidase system) and performed in sodium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0) at 37 °C for 60 min under the conditions described in the figure and table legends. Reactions were stopped by the addition of phenol (1% final) and catalase (30 nm; for glucose/glucose oxidase studies) to the reaction mixture. The pH dependence of 3-nitrotyrosine formation was assayed in phosphate buffer (50 mm final) composed of mixtures of phosphoric acid and monobasic and dibasic sodium phosphate. The pH of each reaction mixture was determined at the end of the incubation and did not change by more than 0.2 pH units over the course of the reaction. Experiments utilizing the glucose/glucose oxidase system for H2O2 generation were performed in the presence of 100 μg/ml glucose and 20 ng/ml glucose oxidase (grade II; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for the indicated times. Preliminary studies demonstrated that under these conditions, a constant flux of H2O2 (0.18 μm/min) was generated. Preliminary studies confirmed that removal of NO2− prior to acidification of proteins was essential to avoid artifactual nitration of proteins. Proteins oxidized in vitro were therefore prepared for analysis by first precipitating and desalting them in a single-phase extraction mixture composed of H2O/methanol/H2O-saturated diethyl ether (1:3:7, v/v/v) as described (47Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Gaut J.P. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteins were typically hydrolyzed by incubating the desalted protein pellet with 6 n HCl (0.5 ml) supplemented with 1% phenol for 24 h (47Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Gaut J.P. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 88-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Prior to initiating hydrolysis, acid mixtures were degassed under vacuum and then sealed under a blanket of argon. When chlorotyrosine and/or bromotyrosine determinations were performed, formation of trace levels of halogenated tyrosine analogs during acid hydrolysis was avoided by hydrolysis in 4 n methane sulfonic acid (0.5 ml) supplemented with 1% phenol for 24 h at 100 °C under a blanket of argon (21Wu W. Chen Y. d'Avignon A. Hazen S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3538-3548Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Control experiments utilizing proteins supplemented withl -[2H4]tyrosine as internal standard added prior to acid hydrolysis and then analyzed by GC/MS (48Hazen S.L. Crowley J.R. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated no detectable intrapreparative formation of 3-nitro-[2H3]tyrosine, 3-chloro-[2H3]tyrosine, or 3-bromo-[2H3]tyrosine under these conditions. Quantification of oxidation products from freel-tyrosine (3-nitrotyrosine, 3-bromotyrosine, 3,5-dibromotyrosine, 3-chlorotyrosine, and o,o′-dityrosine) was performed on a Beckman Gold HPLC system equipped with diode array and fluorescence detectors. Separations were performed on a C18 column (Beckman Ultrasphere, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5). l-Tyrosine and its oxidation products were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a linear gradient generated with solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol, pH 2.5) as follows: 0% solvent B for 5 min, 0–100% solvent B over 30 min, 100% solvent B for 10 min. Products were quantified employing standard curves constructed with authentic synthetic standards.N α-acetyl-l-tyrosine-derived oxidation products were isolated, and their structures were confirmed by on-line electrospray ionization mass spectrometric analysis as described below. Routine quantification of N α-acetyl-l-tyrosine oxidation products was determined by reverse phase HPLC with UV detection (A280) as above, utilizing external calibration curves constructed with known amounts of their nonacetylated counterparts (and assuming identical extinction coefficients). The retention times of N α-acetyl-l-tyrosine analogs of tyrosine oxidation products were determined using authentic standards isolated at the time of on-line liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric analysis (LC/MS). 3-Nitrotyrosine, 3-bromotyrosine, 3,5-dibromotyrosine, o,o′-dityrosine, and 3-chlorotyrosine in protein hydrolysates were routinely quantified by reverse phase HPLC with electrochemical (coulometric) detection on an ESA (Cambridge, MA) CoulArray HPLC instrument equipped with UV detector and electrochemical cells (six channels) arranged in series and set to increasing specified potentials: channel 1 (300 mV); channel 2 (350 mV); channel 3 (480 mV); channel 4 (650 mV); channel 5 (800 mV); channel 6 (880 mV). Chromatographic separation of amino acids was performed on a a Projel TSK ODS-80 TM column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with mobile phase A (15 mm lithium phosphate, 3 mg/liter lithium dodecyl sulfate, pH 3.2). Products were eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a nonlinear gradient generated with mobile phase B (50% methanol, 15 mm lithium phosphate, 3 mg/liter lithium dodecyl sulfate, pH 3.2) as follows: isocratic elution at 0% mobile phase B for 10 min, 0–15% mobile phase B over 10 min, isocratic elution at 15% mobile phase B for 10 min, 15–20% mobile phase B over 10 min, isocratic elution at 20% mobile phase B for 10 min, 20–100% mobile phase B over 20 min, isocratic elution at 100% mobile phase B for 10 min. Peak identity was established by demonstrating the appropriate retention time, redox potential, and ratio of integrated currents in adjacent channels and by the method of standard additions for each analyte. l-Tyrosine, 3-nitrotyrosine, 3-bromotyrosine, 3,5-dibromotyrosine, o,o′-dityrosine, and 3-chlorotyrosine standards (0.5–50 pmol each on column) were also dissolved together and used to generate external calibration curves. The experimental error in data obtained by this assay is less than ±5%. Control experiments comparing quantitation of the tyrosine analogues by stable isotope dilution GC/MS (45Heinecke J.W. Hsu F.F.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 124-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) versus reverse phase with electrochemical detection demonstrated comparable results. LC/MS was performed using electrospray ionization (ESI) and detection with a Quatro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Inc.) interfaced with an HP 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE) equipped with diode array detector. l-Tyrosine oxidation products were resolved on an Ultrasphere C18 column (Beckman; 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a linear gradient between H2O (with 0.3% formic acid) and methanol (with 0.3% formic acid) over 30 min. Column eluent was split (970 μl/min to diode array, 30 μl/min to mass detector) and analyzed in the positive ion mode with a cone potential of 30 eV. GC/MS analyses of HPLC-isolated l-tyrosine oxidation products were performed following derivatization to their n-propyl perheptafluorylbutyryl or n-propyl perpentafluorylproprionyl derivatives (49Knapp D.R. Handbook of Analytical Derivatization Reactions. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979: 485-486Google Scholar). 3-Nitrotyrosine was also analyzed by GC/MS analysis as its n-propyl perheptafluorylbutyryl derivative following reduction to 3-aminotyrosine (50Crowley J.R. Yarasheski K. Leeuwenburgh C. Turk J. Heinecke J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS studies were performed utilizing a Perkin Elmer (Norwalk, CT) TurboMass spectrometer equipped with chemical ionization probe. The addition of purified EPO and H2O2 to reaction buffer (20 mmsodium phosphate, 100 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, pH 7.0) supplemented with l - tyrosine generated several new species with distinct retention times on reverse phase HPLC analysis with diode array detection (Fig.1, upper panel, peaks a–c). The ultraviolet absorption maximum of each peak was nearly indistinguishable froml - tyrosine (λmax 275–285 nm). LC/MS analyses were consistent with formation of the tyrosyl radical addition products o,o′-dityrosine and isodityrosine (peak a; m/z 361 (M + H)+), pulcherosine (peak b; m/z 540 (M + H)+), and trityrosine (peak c; m/z 540 (M + H)+) (44Jacob J.S.

Here we addressed the question of whether isolated, unbalanced overexpression of the antioxidant enzyme manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) may modulate signal transduction cascades, finally leading to connective tissue degradation, a hallmark in carcinogenesis and aging. Therefore, we generated stably Mn-SOD-overexpressing fibroblasts with an up to 4.6-fold increase in Mn-SOD activity. The Mn-SOD-overexpressing cells revealed specific resistance to the superoxide anion (O⨪2)-generating agent paraquat, whereas no resistance to UVA-generated oxidative stress was found. Treatment of the Mn-SOD-overexpressing cells with various ROS-generating systems resulted (due to the enhanced dismutation of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide) in an up to 9.5-fold increase in matrix-degrading metalloprotease-1 (MMP-1) mRNA levels. A similar increase in MMP-1 mRNA was also seen when the intracellular H2O2 concentration was increased by the inhibition of different H2O2-detoxifying pathways. Furthermore, prooxidant conditions led to a strong induction of c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels resulting in a 4-fold higher transactivation of the transcription factor AP-1 in the Mn-SOD-overexpressing cells. Collectively, we have found that enhanced Mn-SOD activity, via an unbalanced H2O2overproduction and detoxification, induces MMP-1 mRNA levels, and this effect is at least partly mediated by the DNA recognition sequence AP-1.

Apart from permanent genetic changes involving protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 activate cytoplasmatic signal transduction pathways that are related to growth, differentiation, senescence, and tissue degradation. Therefore, ROS have been implicated to play a causal role in cancer, aging, and other degenerative diseases like arteriosclerosis, osteoarthritis, and impaired wound healing. These pathological states share unique features and are all characterized by a dysregulated localized (as is the case for cancer, invasion, and metastasis) or diffuse connective tissue breakdown due to enhanced activity of various matrix-degrading metalloproteases (3Gallagher R.P.

Large efforts have been made to better define the involvement of distinct ROS in degenerative conditions to identify enzymes and molecules that can scavenge oxygen radicals for their potential in the prevention and therapy of these disorders. To protect against oxidant injury, aerobic cells have evolved a multilayered interdependent antioxidant system that includes enzymatic and nonenzymatic components. The individual antioxidant enzymes are located in specific subcellular sites and reveal distinct substrate specificity. Among these, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) has been the subject of particular interest because it is located in the mitochondria and represents the first line of defense against superoxide radicals produced as byproduct of oxidative phosphorylation, upon UV 6irradiation and during immunological and nonimmunological inflammatory processes. Mn-SOD can be induced by its substrate, the superoxide anion itself, and appears to be involved in processes like tumor suppression and cellular differentiation (22Harris C.A. Derbin K.S.

Superoxide anions are dismutated by Mn-SOD to hydrogen peroxide, which is subsequently detoxified by catalase present in peroxisomes or by glutathione peroxidase present in mitochondria and the cytosol.

Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar) to further dissect the role of distinct reactive oxygen species overproduced at defined subcellular sites in signaling mechanisms underlying connective tissue degradation. Stably transfected cell clones with an up to 4.6-fold overexpression of Mn-SOD revealed specific resistance to superoxide anion-induced cytotoxicity, while increased production of hydrogen peroxide, due to enhanced dismutation of superoxide anion, resulted in a dramatic induction of MMP-1. This hydrogen peroxide-dependent 9.5-fold induction of MMP-1 was found to be at least in part due to enhanced c-fos and c-jun transcription and subsequently enhanced transactivation of AP-1. Thus, isolated overexpression or stimulation of Mn-SOD without coordinate increase in interdependent antioxidant enzymes working in the same detoxification pathway such as catalase and glutathione peroxidase results in an intracellular increase in distinct ROS, which activate signal transduction pathways regulating the expression of transcription factors and effector genes related to connective tissue degradation.

Pharmacol. 1993; 123: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). The MMP-1 probe used was a 920-base pair (bp) Hin dIII/Sma I fragment of human collagenase cDNA (33Angel P. Rahmsdorf H.J. Pöting A. Lücke-Huhle C. Herrlich P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 29: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), the probe for c-jun was a 1400-bp Hin dIII/Bam HI fragment of the cDNA clone hcJ-1 (34Angel P. Allegretto E.A. Okino S.T. Hattori K. Boyle W.J. Hunter T. Karin M. Nature. 1988; 332: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and the probe for c-fos was an 800-bp Bgl II/Nco I fragment originally inserted in pUC 18 (35Angel P. Smeal T. Meek J. Karin M.

Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) for the 18 S rRNA was synthesized (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany). The human skin fibroblast cell line 1306 was obtained from ECACC (Salisbury, United Kingdom; ECACC no. 90011887). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (400 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 mg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were passaged at a 1:3 dilution every 3 days. Recombinant cells were selected in neomycin (G 418) (Life Technologies) at 150 μg/ml, a concentration that completely inhibited the growth of nontransfected cells. The 1.0-kilobase pair human Mn-SOD cDNA fragment flanked by the Eco RI restriction site was inserted into the Eco RI site of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The human liver Mn-SOD cDNA (37Wispe J.R. Clark J.C. Burhans M.S. Kropp K.E. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. Jonathan Wispé of the Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH) encodes the entire 198-amino acid proprotein and includes 95 bp of the 5′-untranslated region and 216 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences. The used expression vector contains the human cytomegalovirus major intermediate early promoter/enhancer region and a neomycin resistance marker for the selection of stable transfectants in the presence of G418. The cytomegalovirus promotor is enhanced by the SV40 promoter. Subconfluent cultures of the fibroblast cells 1306 were transfected with the Mn-SOD expression vector (20 μg) by calcium-phosphate precipitation (38Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6491) Google Scholar) or by the transfection reagent LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). Both methods gave similar results. For selection of stable transfectants, G418 (Life Technologies) was added to the cells 24 h after transfection. Individual neomycin-resistant cell clones were screened by measuring Mn-SOD activity (Ref. 2Sies H. Oxidative Stress: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991Google Scholar; see below). Control cells were transfected with the vector pcDNA3 alone and maintained under identical conditions. All assays were performed with cells in a logarithmic growth phase. The activity of SOD was detected by the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction method according to Beauchamp and Fridovich (39Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9881) Google Scholar). The inhibition by SOD of nitro blue tetrazolium in the aerobic xanthine/xanthine oxidase system was followed at 560 nm. One unit of SOD corresponds to 50% inhibition of nitro blue tetrazolium reduction. Mn-SOD activity was differentiated from Cu,Zn-SOD by its resistance to 5 mm cyanide. Catalase activity was measured by monitoring the disappearance of H2O2 at 240 nm in the presence of cellular lysates (40Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 105: 121-126Crossref Scopus (18610) Google Scholar). Selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase was assayed using GSH and t-butylhydroperoxide as substrate and monitoring GSSG production through NADPH oxidation by glutathione reductase (41Flohe L. Günzler W.A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (4065) Google Scholar). The phospholipid glutathione peroxidase activity was similarly determined except that phosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide instead of t-butylhydroperoxide was used (42Maiorino M. Chu F.F. Ursini F. Davies K.J.A. Doroshow J.H. Esworthy S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7728-7732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using Coomassie Blue with albumin as the standard (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar). The cells were irradiated at a distance of 40 cm using a high intensity halogen metallide UVA source (UVASUN®3000 equipped with the UVASUN® safety filters) emitting wavelengths in the 340–450-nm range (Mutzhas, Munich, Germany) (44Mutzhas M.F. Hölzle E. Hofmann C. Plewig G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1981; 76: 42-47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The spectral distribution of the UVASUN®3000 source was determined with a Beckman UV 5270 spectral photometer. The incident dose at the surface of the cells was 66 milliwatts/s. Dose rates were monitored with a combined UVA/UVB ultravioletmeter (Centra-UV dosimeter; Osram, Munich, Germany) (45Lehmann P. Hölzle E. von Krus R. Plewig G. Zentralblatt Haut. 1986; 152: 667-682Google Scholar). During irradiation, cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and maintained at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled water bath. Following irradiation, PBS was replaced by fresh medium with 10% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for various periods of time. The viability of the transfectants was monitored 24 h after treatment with paraquat, UVA irradiation, or incubation with BSO, ATZ, or DFO. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) was used for the quantification of living metabolically active cells. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases metabolize MTT to a purple formazan dye, measured photometrically between 550 and 600 nm (46Green L.M. Reade J.L. Ware C.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 70: 257-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Cytotoxicity was calculated as the percentage of formazan formation in cells treated under various conditions and chemical agents compared with mock-treated cells. We intended to avoid interference of cytotoxicity from chemical agents. Therefore, DFO was used at a nontoxic concentration of 10 μm, ATZ was used at 100 μm, and BSO was used at 10 μm. The cellular release of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into serum-free and dye-free media was assayed using a scopoletin fluorescence assay. In this assay, H2O2oxidizes up to 300 nm scopoletin to a nonfluorescent state in a reaction catalyzed by 1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase (47Szatrowski T.P. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 794-798PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in fluorescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Emission was measured at 460 nm. Plots were standardized with defined concentrations of H2O2. The specificity of the generation and release of H2O2 was tested by the addition of catalase (4000 units/ml). For specimen fixation and embedding, cells were fixed in situ for 1 h in Carson Millonig's fixative (4% formaldehyde in 0.16 m monobasic sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Prior to embedding in medium grade LR White (Electron Microscopy Science, Ft. Washington, PA), samples were partially dehydrated in 70% ethanol with subsequent immersion and infiltration in undiluted LR White resin. All dehydration and infiltration steps with LR White were carried out at 25 °C. Resin polymerization was thermally induced in sealed gelatin capsules at 45 °C for 48 h in the absence of any accelerator. Ultrathin sections (70–80 nm) were cut on a Sorvall MT2-B ultramicrotome with a Diatome knife and subsequently transferred to 300-m nickel grids for immunolabeling experiments. For postembedding immunogold procedure, sections were first incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, and 0.06% sodium azide in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0.05 m Tris base with 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.6) for 30–60 min at 4 °C to block nonspecific antibody binding and then with rabbit polyclonal antihuman kidney Mn-SOD in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 18 h at 4 °C. After briefly washing the sections in TBS buffer (1:5 dilution of block buffer) and then in TBS, pH 8.2, the sections were transferred to a 1:50 dilution of gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Auroprobe, EM GAR G10; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS, pH 8.2, containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin at ambient temperature for 60 min. The sections were further washed in TBS, pH 8.2, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed extensively with double distilled water, and counterstained with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 min. Immunogold labeling was assessed with a Philips 30 transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed by Northern blots using specific cDNA probes or oligonucleotides for MMP-1, c-jun, c-fos, and 18 S ribosomal RNA for sequential hybridization (36Carlson S.G. Fawcett T.W. Bartlett J.D. Bernier M. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4736-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 48Herrmann G. Wlaschek M. Lange T.S. Prenzel K. Goerz G. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Dermatol. 1993; 2: 92-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Conca W. Kaplan P.B. Krane S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1753-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, after extraction of total RNA, equal amounts of total RNA (5–20 μg/lane) were fractionated by size on a 0.9% 2.2 mformaldhyde/agarose gel and blotted to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Hybridizations were performed using denatured32P-labeled cDNA probes. For 3′-end labeling of the 24-mer 18 S ribosomal RNA probe, 5× terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase buffer (0.5 m potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 10 mm CoCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 10 pmol of 3′-ends (80 ng of DNA of the 24-mer), 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP/μl of reaction volume, and 1 unit/ml terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Densitometric analysis was performed using the ScanPackII system (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). The collagenase CAT constructs were kindly provided by Peter Angel (DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany) and have been described previously (50Angel P. Baumann I. Stein B. Delius J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2256-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 51Stein B. Rahmsdorf H.J. Steffen A. Litfin M. Herrlich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5169-5181Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The −517/+63 CAT construct contains the 5′ control region of the collagenase gene reaching from base −517 to +63 including an AP-1 binding sequence at positions −73 to −42, which is required for the induction of transcription by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. The −517/+63 mutTRECollCAT construct contains a mutated TPA response element between −72 and −65 (wild type, −74ATG AGT CAG−66; −517/+63 TPA response element,−74AGT ACT CAG−66). The plasmid pCMV-βGal (CLONTECH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used as internal control. Cells were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106 the day prior to transfection. CAT reporter plasmids (25 μg) and the pCMV-βGal plasmid (2.5 μg) were cotransfected by calcium phosphate precipitation (38Graham F. van der Eb A. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6491) Google Scholar) using a 2-min glycerol shock at 4 h after treatment of cells with the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate. Twelve h after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and irradiated at a dose of 300 kJ/m2 in PBS. Subsequently, the original “preirradiation medium” was added back to the irradiated cells. For control purposes, cultures were mock-treated. For the quantitation of expressed CAT protein, cells were detached 30 h after transfection with PBS, 10 mm EDTA; collected by centrifugation; resuspended in 200 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 5 mm EDTA; and lysed by four freezing/thawing cycles. Fifty mg of total cellular protein was assayed by a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was determined in a type 2010 luminometer (ALL, San Diego), using a commercial assay system (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany). All transfections were performed in duplicate and assayed at least three times. The human fibroblast cell line 1306 was transfected with the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 containing the cDNA of human Mn-SOD and a neomycin resistance cassette. Several G418-resistant cell clones were isolated. The Mn-SOD activity of these clones was 2.2–4.6-fold increased compared with that of the parental wild type 1306 cells and 1306 cells transfected with the neomycin resistance expression vector pcDNA3 alone. The Mn-SOD clones, Mn-SOD3 with a 4.6-fold increase, Mn-SOD12 with a 3.2-fold increase, and Mn-SOD14 with a 2.5-fold increase in Mn-SOD activity were further studied as indicated. Increased expression of clone Mn-SOD3 did not significantly alter the activities of other antioxidant enzymes including copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu,Zn-SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and the phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (Table 1). To ascertain that the overexpressed Mn-SOD was properly transported into the mitochondria, immunoelectron microscopy was performed using an antibody against Mn-SOD (Fig. 1). Control cells transfected with the neomycin resistance expression vector alone revealed only low labeling (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, the Mn-SOD-transfected cell clone Mn-SOD3 revealed a strong labeling in mitochondria, indicating that Mn-SOD is increased at their physiological site of production (Fig. 1 B). There was very low, slightly above background labeling in the extramitochondrial cytosol. This low amount of extramitochondrial labeling may be due to antibody detection of the Mn-SOD precursor form on its way from the nucleus to the mitochondria. Substitution of the primary antibody by normal rabbit serum did not show any immunolabeling in both control and Mn-SOD-expressing cells (data not shown). Overall, these data show that in this system the overexpression of the recombinant Mn-SOD is correctly routed and processed within the cells. UVA irradiation and paraquat are known to intracellularly induce oxidative stress. Upon UVA irradiation particularly, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, and to a minor extent superoxide anions are generated, while paraquat cytotoxicity is mainly due to the increased intracellular production of superoxide anions. To determine whether an increase in Mn-SOD activity protects against these different forms of oxidant injury, two control cell clones, including 1306 cells transfected with the neomycin resistance vector alone, and three Mn-SOD-overexpressing cell clones were exposed to UVA irradiation at doses ranging from 100 to 1500 kJ/m2, and in a different set of experiments they were exposed to paraquat at concentrations ranging from 200 to 750 μm. The tested Mn-SOD clones showed an increase in Mn-SOD activity ranging from 2.5-fold (Mn-SOD14) to 3.2-fold (Mn-SOD12) and 4.6-fold (Mn-SOD3). Only modest alteration in viability of Mn-SOD-overexpressing cells, as assessed by the MTT assay, was detected upon UVA irradiation compared with the control cells (Fig.2 A). Apparently, the clones expressing 4.6- and 3.2-fold more Mn-SOD are slightly less viable in response to high UVA doses of 1200 kJ/m2"

Cyclic AMP (cAMP) has divergent effects on MAPK activity depending on whether signaling is through Ras/Raf-1 or Rap1/B-raf. We found that central nervous system-derived neurons, but not astrocytes, express B-raf. In neurons, cAMP activated MAPK in a Rap1/B-raf-dependent manner, while in astrocytes, cAMP decreased MAPK activity. Inhibition of MAPK in neurons decreased neuronal growth factor-mediated survival, and activation of MAPK by cAMP analogues rescued neurons from death. Furthermore, constitutive expression of B-raf in astrocytoma cells increased MAPK activation, as seen in neurons, and enhanced proliferation. These data provide the first experimental evidence that B-raf is the molecular switch which dominantly permits differential cAMP-dependent regulation of MAPK in neurons versus astrocytes, with important implications for both survival and proliferation.

In the absence of peptide growth factors, the majority of motor neurons extended processes and survived for 1 week in response to cAMP, while the combination of multiple peptide trophic factors with cAMP elevation extended neuronal survival in serum-free media for as much as 3 weeks. Similarly, survival of superior cervical ganglion neurons (2Rydel R.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Edwards S.N.

However, the inability of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 inhibitors to block the pro-survival effects of cAMP in both neuronal types suggests that cAMP may promote neuronal survival by additional non-PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) mechanisms (4Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 6Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol.

Barres B.A. Neuron. 1998; 21: 681-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), suggesting that cAMP may promote neuronal survival, in part, by increasing neurotrophin receptor availability and signaling.The traditional receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by Ras-dependent recruitment of Raf-1, which subsequently phosphorylates MAPK kinase (MEK) and results in activation of MAPK (8Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Mitra G. Weber M. Stacey D. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). However, an alternative pathway was recently described in PC12 cells, which preferentially utilizes Rap1 and 95-kDa B-raf, instead of Ras/Raf-1, to activate MEK (10Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These two pathways, Ras/Raf-1 and Rap1/B-raf, differ in their response to cAMP, with cAMP inhibiting MAPK when signaling is through Ras/Raf-1, and activating MAPK when signaling is through Rap1/B-raf (10Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This divergent signaling has been reported to reflect cAMP regulation of Rap1 activity and selective interaction of Rap1, instead of Ras, with 95-kDa B-raf (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Although cAMP effects on Rap1 were attributed to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in that study, a recent report suggests that cAMP may have non-PKA-dependent actions on Rap1 mediated by cAMP binding and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs) (12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar).B-raf mRNA has been detected in brain and spinal cord (13Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the expression of B-raf protein in specific central nervous system cell types has not been determined. We employed cultured primary cortical astrocytes and neurons, astrocytoma cells, and a hypothalamic neuronal cell line to assess expression of B-raf protein in neurons and astrocytes and then compared MAPK activity in these cell types in response to cAMP. Although Rap1 is clearly required for cAMP-dependent inhibition of Ras-mediated MAPK activation (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the question of whether Rap1 activation is sufficient to inhibit Ras signaling has not been established. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that B-raf is a cell-type-specific molecular switch capable of determining whether cAMP has a stimulatory or inhibitory influence on MAPK activity in central nervous system parenchymal cells, and furthermore, that the Rap1/B-raf response to cAMP is dominant over that of Ras/Raf-1. We generated astrocytoma cell lines expressing various mutant forms of Rap1 and measured MAPK activity to ascertain whether Rap1 directly inhibited MAPK activity. Furthermore, in light of the recently identified cAMP-GEFs, which appear to mediate many cAMP effects formerly attributed to activation of PKA (12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), we asked whether cAMP effects on MAPK were reversed by inhibition of PKA. Finally, to determine whether B-raf expression alone was sufficient to mediate divergent MAPK responses to cAMP in neurons and astrocytes, we generated B-raf-expressing astrocytoma cells and evaluated their response to cAMP.In this report, we characterized the Ras/Raf-1 and Rap1/B-raf signaling pathways in neurons and astrocytes, and evaluated the effect of cAMP, acting through these two pathways, on MAPK activity. We then determined the functional implications of cAMP-regulated MAPK signaling for survival and proliferation of neurons and astrocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that cyclic AMP (cAMP) provides a powerful survival signal for neurons.

The traditional receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by Ras-dependent recruitment of Raf-1, which subsequently phosphorylates MAPK kinase (MEK) and results in activation of MAPK (8Moodie S.A. Willumsen B.M. Weber M.J. Wolfman A. Science. 1993; 260: 1658-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Mitra G. Weber M. Stacey D. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 517-523PubMed Google Scholar). However, an alternative pathway was recently described in PC12 cells, which preferentially utilizes Rap1 and 95-kDa B-raf, instead of Ras/Raf-1, to activate MEK (10Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). These two pathways, Ras/Raf-1 and Rap1/B-raf, differ in their response to cAMP, with cAMP inhibiting MAPK when signaling is through Ras/Raf-1, and activating MAPK when signaling is through Rap1/B-raf (10Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). This divergent signaling has been reported to reflect cAMP regulation of Rap1 activity and selective interaction of Rap1, instead of Ras, with 95-kDa B-raf (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). Although cAMP effects on Rap1 were attributed to activation of protein kinase A (PKA) in that study, a recent report suggests that cAMP may have non-PKA-dependent actions on Rap1 mediated by cAMP binding and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (cAMP-GEFs) (12Kawasaki H.

B-raf mRNA has been detected in brain and spinal cord (13Barnier J.V. Papin C. Eychene A. Lecoq O. Calothy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23381-23389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), but the expression of B-raf protein in specific central nervous system cell types has not been determined. We employed cultured primary cortical astrocytes and neurons, astrocytoma cells, and a hypothalamic neuronal cell line to assess expression of B-raf protein in neurons and astrocytes and then compared MAPK activity in these cell types in response to cAMP. Although Rap1 is clearly required for cAMP-dependent inhibition of Ras-mediated MAPK activation (11York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), the question of whether Rap1 activation is sufficient to inhibit Ras signaling has not been established. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that B-raf is a cell-type-specific molecular switch capable of determining whether cAMP has a stimulatory or inhibitory influence on MAPK activity in central nervous system parenchymal cells, and furthermore, that the Rap1/B-raf response to cAMP is dominant over that of Ras/Raf-1. We generated astrocytoma cell lines expressing various mutant forms of Rap1 and measured MAPK activity to ascertain whether Rap1 directly inhibited MAPK activity. Furthermore, in light of the recently identified cAMP-GEFs, which appear to mediate many cAMP effects formerly attributed to activation of PKA (12Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), we asked whether cAMP effects on MAPK were reversed by inhibition of PKA. Finally, to determine whether B-raf expression alone was sufficient to mediate divergent MAPK responses to cAMP in neurons and astrocytes, we generated B-raf-expressing astrocytoma cells and evaluated their response to cAMP. In this report, we characterized the Ras/Raf-1 and Rap1/B-raf signaling pathways in neurons and astrocytes, and evaluated the effect of cAMP, acting through these two pathways, on MAPK activity. We then determined the functional implications of cAMP-regulated MAPK signaling for survival and proliferation of neurons and astrocytes.

In the present study, we demonstrate that Homer 1b (H1b), a constitutively expressed splice form of the immediate early gene product Homer (now termed Homer 1a) regulates the trafficking and surface expression of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. H1b inhibits surface expression of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5 in heterologous cells, causing mGluR5 to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In contrast, mGluR5 alone or mGluR5 coexpressed with Homer 1a successfully travels through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. In addition, point mutations that disrupt mGluR5 binding to H1b eliminate ER retention of mGluR5, demonstrating that H1b affects metabotropic receptor localization via a direct protein-protein interaction. Electron microscopic analysis reveals that the group I metabotropic receptor mGluR1α is significantly enriched in the ER of Purkinje cells, suggesting that a similar mechanism may exist in vivo.

The synaptic expression of glutamate receptors may be controlled exclusively by regulating their interactions with these anchoring proteins, or additional mechanisms may exist which regulate the intracellular targeting and availability of receptors for synaptic insertion. Homer, now termed Homer 1a, was originally identified as a brain immediate early gene product based on its rapid and transient induction in hippocampal neurons following synaptic activation (13Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported a novel family of Homer-related proteins that possess a putative N-terminal EVH1 domain that confers the capacity to bind the C terminus of group I metabotropic receptors (14Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Newly identified family members include two splice variants of the Homer 1 gene, termed Homer 1b and Homer 1c, as well as two different Homer genes, termed Homer 2 and Homer 3. Unlike the original immediate early gene form, all subsequently identified Homer family members are constitutively expressed in brain and encode an additional C-terminal coiled-coil motif. This motif mediates protein-protein interactions, including self-multimerization (14Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F.

In the present study, we demonstrate that H1b,1 unlike H1a, inhibits surface expression of mGluR5 when the two proteins are coexpressed in heterologous cells. Using immunofluorescent and biochemical techniques, we show that H1b causes mGluR5 to be retained within the ER. The effect of H1b on the trafficking of mGluR5 requires a direct interaction between mGluR5 and H1b and is not observed when mGluR5 is coexpressed with the immediate early gene form H1a, which binds metabotropic receptor but lacks the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. Although these experiments were performed in heterologous cells, we also observe enrichment of the group I metabotropic receptor mGluR1α in the ER of Purkinje cells. This suggests H1b-regulated ER retention may occur in vivo, possibly revealing a novel mechanism for synapse-specific receptor expression. mGluR1α, mGluR2, and mGluR5 cDNAs were generously provided by S. Nakanishi, and each was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRK5. H1a and H1b were also subcloned into pRK5 and included an N-terminal Myc epitope.

Parasagittal sections of the rostral cerebellum (folia III–V) were cryoprotected in 30% glycerol, frozen in liquid propane in a Leica EM CPC, immersed in 1.5% uranyl acetate in methanol at −90 °C in a Leica AFS freeze-substitution instrument, infiltrated with Lowicryl HM 20 resin at −45 °C, and polymerized with UV light. Thin sections were incubated in 0.1% sodium borohydride plus 50 mm glycine in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST), followed by 10% NGS in TBST, primary antibody in 1% NGS/TBST, 10 nm immunogold (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1% NGS/TBST plus 0.5% polyethylene glycol, and finally stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. mGluR1α antibody was used at a dilution of 1:25. To determine whether different Homer family members have distinct functional roles in metabotropic receptor localization, we first investigated the effect of the Homer 1 gene products, H1a and H1b, on cell surface expression of mGluR5. We chose to coexpress mGluR5 with H1a or with H1b in heterologous cells, to allow independent characterization of the different Homer splice variants. To specifically label surface-expressed receptors, we used an antibody (N-mGluR5) raised against an extracellular epitope of mGluR5 to stain live cells for microscopic analysis. mGluR5 was expressed on the surface of HeLa cells when expressed alone or when coexpressed with H1a. Surprisingly, mGluR5 did not reach the cell surface when coexpressed with the alternatively spliced long form of Homer 1, H1b (Fig. 1). Importantly, both immunofluorescent analysis of permeabilized cells and Western blot analysis of cell extracts revealed that total mGluR5 expression was not affected by cotransfection with H1b (Figs.2 A and4).Figure 2mGluR5 is retained in the ER when coexpressed with H1b. A, distribution of mGluR5 expressed alone, with H1a, or with H1b.

In contrast, mGluR5 expressed with H1b had a dramatically different subcellular localization. mGluR5 was present in perinuclear organelles as well as extensive reticular staining present throughout the cell that strongly resembled that of the ER (Fig. 2 A). To confirm that the effect of H1b was not restricted to mGluR5, we expressed H1b with another group I metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR1α, and analyzed the intracellular distribution of the glutamate receptor. Like mGluR5, mGluR1α appeared to be localized to ER when coexpressed with H1b (data not shown). To conclusively identify the intracellular compartment containing mGluR5, we double-labeled mGluR5/H1b cotransfected cells with antibodies recognizing mGluR5 and the ER-resident protein BiP. Staining with BiP antibodies revealed the extensive ER present in both transfected and untransfected cells. The mGluR5 antibodies only recognized transfected cells and revealed colocalization with the BiP-positive reticulum and the perinuclear organelles, confirming that mGluR5 was present within the ER and ER-derived structures (Fig.2 B). It should be noted that the perinuclear organelles were not present within nontransfected cells and therefore appear to be ER-derived structures unique to cells overexpressing mGluR5 and H1b. These observations suggest that H1b, but not H1a, causes mGluR5 to be retained in the ER. We also performed double-labeling immunofluorescent microscopy of mGluR5 and H1b when these two proteins were coexpressed in HeLa cells. mGluR5 and H1b displayed considerable colocalization (Fig. 3) with bright immunoreactivity in the ER and perinuclear organelles. Although complete colocalization was common, we also often observed colocalization of the two proteins with excess plasma membrane localization of H1b. As an additional assay for ER retention, we examined the status of the carbohydrates present on mGluR5 in cells expressing H1a or H1b. If H1b caused mGluR5 to be retained within the ER, then mGluR5 should contain immature, high mannose carbohydrates that are sensitive to digestion with the enzyme Endo H. Alternatively, if mGluR5 had successfully traveled through the ER and cis-Golgi, it would possess mature, complex carbohydrates that would be Endo H-resistant. Mature carbohydrates would be anticipated if mGluR5 was on the cell surface or if it was sequestered in a post-Golgi intracellular compartment such as endosomes. We prepared membranes from mock transfected cells, cells expressing mGluR5 alone, or cells coexpressing mGluR5 and H1a or H1b. These membranes were treated with no enzyme, Endo H, or N-glycosidase F, an enzyme that removes all Asn-linked carbohydrates. Immunoblotting with mGluR5 antibodies revealed that mGluR5 is Endo H-resistant when expressed alone or with H1a. However, when expressed with H1b, mGluR5 is Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 4), consistent with the hypothesis that expression of H1b leads to the retention of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors in the ER. We were surprised that coexpression of mGluR5 with H1b caused complete ER retention of mGluR5 as detected by surface staining (Fig. 1) and carbohydrate analysis (Fig. 4). To determine whether H1b was present at saturating concentrations when coexpressed with mGluR5, we varied the amount of H1b expressed with mGluR5 to determine whether there existed a dose-response effect of H1b on mGluR5 trafficking to the cell surface (Fig. 5). We transfected cells with constant amounts of mGluR5 (5 μg) and increasing amounts of H1b (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 5 μg) to evaluate the effect H1b had on mGluR5 localization. We found that low levels of H1b expression did not result in the ER retention of mGluR5, whereas higher concentrations did result in ER retention. All other experiments we conducted used equal amounts of mGluR5 and H1b cDNA and therefore reflect the effect H1b has on mGluR5 under saturating conditions. We next wanted to confirm that overexpression of H1b did not cause the nonspecific retention of proteins in the ER. The subcellular localization of the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2 was the same whether expressed alone or with H1b (data not shown). In addition, we used a series of mGluR5 constructs containing point mutations within the Homer binding site and found that mutations that disrupt mGluR5/Homer interactions in vitro also prevent ER retention of mGluR5 coexpressed with H1b (Fig.6). mGluR5 P1125L, which does not bind to Homer in vitro (22Tu J.C.

In contrast, mGluR5 S1126F, which does bind Homer in vitro, was ER-retained when coexpressed with H1b (Fig.6 A). Other point mutations in adjacent residues were analyzed, and the results were consistent with in vitro binding studies (summarized in Fig. 6 B) (22Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar), demonstrating that mGluR5 is retained within the ER by H1b only when its Homer binding site is intact. Although our results clearly demonstrate that H1b retains group I metabotropic receptors in the ER of heterologous cells, its role in neurons may be more complicated. Therefore, we used immunoelectron microscopy to determine the intracellular distribution of mGluR1α, the group I metabotropic receptor expressed within Purkinje cells, which express high levels of H1b (14Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports, mGluR1α is expressed at perisynaptic sites (20Petralia R.S. Zhao H.M. Wang Y.X. Wenthold R.J.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 771-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) (Fig.7, inset). Interestingly, we also find many examples in the cell body and dendrite of Purkinje cells where mGluR1α is concentrated in the ER (Fig. 7), indicating that a major pool of metabotropic glutamate receptors is retained in the ER. The retention in neurons is most apparent in ER of the cell body, although mGluR1α is also found associated with ER of the dendrite. A similar distribution for other metabotropic receptors or the ionotropic glutamate receptors has not been reported, although most receptors have a significant pool associated with a yet undefined membrane population. Thus it appears that group I metabotropic glutamate receptors, at least in some cell types, are enriched in the ER of neurons. In the present study, we investigated the role of H1b in the trafficking and organization of group I metabotropic receptors. Our results show that H1b inhibits the surface expression of mGluR5 when the two proteins are coexpressed in heterologous cells. Immunofluorescent microscopy and carbohydrate analysis of mGluR5 definitively reveal that the impaired surface expression is due to retention of mGluR5 in the ER. We also demonstrate that this ER retention requires a direct interaction between H1b and mGluR5. It is important to note that the ER retention of mGluR5 is specific for H1b because H1a has no effect on mGluR5 localization even though it possesses the same mGluR5 binding site. This finding implicates the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of H1b in ER retention. The coiled-coil domain mediates homomultimerization of H1b and produces a multivalent complex that could cross-link mGluRs to other proteins such as the IP3 receptor (22Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P.

Science. 1991; 251: 568-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the ER retention of an integral membrane protein upon coexpression with a cytosolic binding protein. This novel finding supports the idea that proteins of the Homer family are involved in the transport and localization of group I metabotropic receptors in neurons. Activity-regulated mechanisms have been implicated in the surface expression of mGluRs previously (30Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. Science. 1989; 246: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Using synaptosomes prepared from the visual cortex, it was found that functional group I metabotropic glutamate receptors were developmentally regulated in normal animals but not in dark-reared animals. The activity-dependent increase in the expression of functional phosphatidylinositol-linked metabotropic glutamate receptors almost precisely parallels the expression of H1a observed in light-exposed versus dark-reared animals (13Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K. Barnes C.A. Huganir R.L. Worley P.F. Nature. 1997; 386: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a model in which activity-regulated increases in H1a expression disrupt binding of H1b to mGluRs, leading to increased trafficking of metabotropic receptors to the plasma membrane and additional functional surface receptors. In addition to the regulation of receptor transport, H1b could also form a functional link between the perisynaptic mGluRs and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors in the dendritic ER (22Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Recent findings demonstrate that H1b binds to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that H1a injected into Purkinje cells causes a reduction in calcium released from intracellular stores, consistent with the long Homer isoforms coupling metabotropic receptors to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (22Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). This is a provocative idea because the ER is the functional target of phosphatidylinositol-linked receptors such as group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. In both cases, H1a, the immediate early gene isoform of Homer, is anticipated to act locally to compete with the actions of the constitutively expressed Homer proteins, thereby regulating the function of group I metabotropic receptors. In support of this proposal, it was recently demonstrated that overexpression of H1a in transgenic mice disrupts mGluR5 binding to H1b (14Xiao B. Tu J.C. Petralia R.S. Yuan J.P. Doan A. Breder C.D. Ruggiero A. Lanahan A.A. Wenthold R.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), providing compelling evidence that H1a competes with longer isoforms for receptor binding in vivo. We believe competitive regulation of ER retention close to the postsynaptic membrane could therefore provide a sensitive mechanism for the regulation of synapse-specific surface expression of glutamate receptors.

In Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells, which express low levels of caveolin-2 and no caveolin-1, caveolin-2 localizes exclusively to the Golgi complex but is partially redistributed to the plasma membrane upon co-expression of caveolin-1 by transfection or by adenovirus-mediated transduction. In Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, which constitutively express both caveolin-1 and -2, caveolin-2 localized to both the Golgi complex and to the plasma membrane, where it co-distributed with caveolin-1 in flat patches and in caveolae. In FRT cells, endogenous or overexpressed caveolin-2 did not associate with low density Triton insoluble membranes that floated in sucrose density gradients but was recruited to these membranes when co-expressed together with caveolin-1. In MDCK cells, both caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 associated with low density Triton-insoluble membranes. In FRT cells, transfection of caveolin-1 promoted the assembly of plasma membrane caveolae that localized preferentially (over 99%) to the basolateral surface, like constitutive caveolae of MDCK cells. In contrast, as expected from its intracellular distribution, endogenous or overexpressed caveolin-2 did not promote the assembly of caveolae; rather, it appeared to promote the assembly of intracellular vesicles in the peri-Golgi area. The data reported here demonstrate that caveolin-1 and -2 have different and complementary subcellular localizations and functional properties in polarized epithelial cells and suggest that the two proteins co-operate to carry out specific as yet unknown tasks between the Golgi complex and the cell surface."

These caveolin hetero-oligomers are thought to represent the assembly units that drive caveolae formation in vivo. However, the functional significance of the interaction between caveolins-1 and -2 remains unknown. Here, we show that caveolin-1 co-expression is required for the transport of caveolin-2 from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. We identified a human erythroleukemic cell line, K562, that expresses caveolin-2 but fails to express detectable levels of caveolin-1. This allowed us to stringently assess the effects of recombinant caveolin-1 expression on the behavior of endogenous caveolin-2. We show that expression of caveolin-1 in K562 cells is sufficient to reconstitute the de novo formation of caveolae in these cells. In addition, recombinant expression of caveolin-1 allows caveolin-2 to form high molecular mass oligomers that are targeted to caveolae-enriched membrane fractions. In striking contrast, in the absence of caveolin-1 expression, caveolin-2 forms low molecular mass oligomers that are retained at the level of the Golgi complex. Interestingly, we also show that expression of caveolin-1 in K562 cells dramatically up-regulates the expression of endogenous caveolin-2. Northern blot analysis reveals that caveolin-2 mRNA levels remain constant under these conditions, suggesting that the expression of caveolin-1 stabilizes the caveolin-2 protein. Conversely, transient expression of caveolin-2 in CHO cells is sufficient to up-regulate endogenous caveolin-1 expression.

Caveolins (Cav-1, -2, and -3)1 are a gene family of cytoplasmic membrane-anchored scaffolding proteins that: (i) help to sculpt caveolae membranes from the plasma membrane proper and (ii) participate in the sequestration of inactive signaling molecules (2Lisanti M.P.

In support of this notion, caveolins-1 and -2 form a stable hetero-oligomeric complex of ∼200–400 kDa in cell types where they are co-expressed (6Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A.

However, it has been postulated that caveolin-2 requires caveolin-1 to form high molecular mass oligomers; when caveolin-2 is expressed alone it behaves as a mixture of monomers and dimers (12Li S.

In contrast, caveolin-1 forms high molecular mass homo-oligomers of ∼350 kDa (14Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z.-L. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, it has been hypothesized that caveolin-2 molecules are embedded within or become tightly associated with high molecular mass homo-oligomers formed by caveolin-1 (6Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y.

Given that caveolins-1 and -2 are co-expressed, that they form a hetero-oligomeric complex in vivo, and that even their genes are co-localized to the same chromosomal region in mouse and man, it is apparent that this interaction is of vital importance. Despite the emerging importance of caveolins-1 and -2, little is known about the functional significance of their interactions in vivo. Here, we show that caveolin-2 functionally requires co-expression with caveolin-1 for exit from the Golgi complex. In addition, we directly demonstrate that recombinant expression of caveolin-1 allows caveolin-2 to form high molecular mass oligomers that are Triton-insoluble and are targeted to low density Triton-insoluble plasma membrane domains that are enriched in caveolin-1. Thus, the formation of a hetero-oligomeric complex between caveolins-1 and -2 allows caveolin-2 to be transported from the Golgi to the plasma membrane.

Homogenization was carried out with 10 strokes of a loosely fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose prepared in Mes-buffered saline and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light scattering band confined to the 15–20% sucrose region was observed that contained caveolin-1 but excluded most other cellular proteins. From the top of each gradient, 1-ml gradient fractions were collected to yield a total of 12 fractions. An equal volume from each gradient fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cellular proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated for 2 h in TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% powdered skim milk. After three washes with TBST, membranes were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody in TBST (anti-caveolin-1 IgG diluted 1:1000 or anti-caveolin-2 IgG diluted 1:250) and for 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:5000). Immunoreactivity was revealed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The limit of detection for anti-caveolin-1 IgG was determined experimentally using recombinant caveolin-1 purified after baculo-virus based expression in Sf21 insect cells, as we described previously (11Li S.

Serial dilutions of purified recombinant caveolin-1 were performed (such as 25, 50, and 100 pg of protein), separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were incubated with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (a 1:500 dilution) overnight. Bound antibodies were visualized with an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) and detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After exposure, the films were scanned and quantitated using NIH Image. Using this approach, we determined that the limit of detection was ∼10 pg (defined as twice as much signal as background density). The absolute concentration of recombinant caveolin-1 was determined using a high sensitivity silver staining kit (Waco Chemical, Inc.). K562 cells were washed with PBS, resuspended with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged with a Cytospin Shandon (Pittsburgh, PA) onto a slide. Cells were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Fixed cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min. Then cells were treated with 25 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at room temperature to quench free aldehyde groups. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature; anti-caveolin-1 IgG (rabbit pAb N-20), anti-caveolin-2 IgG (mouse mAb 65), and anti-Cab45 IgG (rabbit pAb) were diluted 1:200, 1:200, and 1:80, respectively, in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After three washes with PBS (10 min each), cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature: either lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (5 μg/ml) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (5 μg/ml). Finally, cells were washed three times with PBS (10 min each wash), and slides were mounted with slow fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR 600 confocal microscope. To confirm the specificity of the antibody probes we utilized, we performed a series of critical control experiments, such as omission of primary antibodies, use of caveolin-1 negative and positive K562 cells, and preabsorption of anti-peptide antibodies with the corresponding epitope, as we described previously (6Scherer P.E.

Total RNA was extracted and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 10 μg of total cellular RNA was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel (1%) and subjected to Northern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled probe to detect the human caveolin-2 mRNA. The 28 S and 18 S rRNA were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 42 °C. The blot was then washed sequentially (twice) with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS (30 min, 68 °C) and 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS (30 min, 68 °C). Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described previously by our laboratory. Briefly, samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide, followed by 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol, and embedded in LX112 resin (LADD Research Industries, Burlington, VT) as detailed in Refs. 25Sargiacomo M.

Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E, stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate, and viewed on a JEOL 1200 EX transmission electron microscope at 180 Kv. The number of caveolae/field was quantitated. >30 fields were subjected to morphometric analysis. To stringently assess the effects of caveolin-1 on the behavior of caveolin-2, we searched for a cell line that fails to express detectable levels of endogenous caveolin-1 but still expresses significant levels of endogenous caveolin-2. Through this screening approach, we identified K562 cells as a cell line that fulfills these criteria (Ref. 6Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29337-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar and data not shown). K562 cells are a well characterized human erythroleukemic cell line. Fig.1 A shows that these cells clearly fail to express caveolin-1 by Western blot analysis. Thus, we used K562 cells as our model system to assess the behavior of caveolin-2 in the absence or presence of recombinantly expressed caveolin-1. We derived a pool of K562 cells stably expressing caveolin-1 using an established expression system (Ref. 18Grignani F. Kinsella T. MEncarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”). Briefly, K562 cells were infected with a recombinant retroviral vector encoding two separate protein products, i.e. GFP and caveolin-1. This allows for a population of transduced cells to be selected by FACS analysis, using GFP as a marker. These cells will be referred to as Cav-1 positive K562 cells. As a control, we also derived a population of cells harboring vector alone using the same GFP/FACS approach (termed Cav-1 negative K562 cells). This strategy allows us to obtain a high infection efficiency (i.e. 30% in K562 cells) and to increase the sorted cell population to virtually 100% of positive expressing cells with the same initial features of the parental cell line without the need for drug selection. Importantly, this approach avoids any possible variation that may occur when selecting clonal cell lines. In this regard, total lysates from parental K562 cells and FACS-sorted caveolin-1 negative or positive K562 were analyzed by Western blotting for caveolin-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1, Cav-1 positive K562 cells expressed caveolin-1 with no detectable variation after 20 or 60 days post-infection. Next, we compared the morphology of the plasma membrane of Cav-1 positive and negative K562 cells by transmission electron microscopy. Our results indicate that recombinant expression of caveolin-1 is sufficient to reconstitute the formation of caveolae in K562 cells. Fig. 2 shows that Cav-1 negative K562 cells lack any detectable caveolae at the plasma membrane. In striking contrast, Cav-1 positive K562 cells show numerous flask-shaped caveolae at the plasma membrane (∼2,000–4,000 caveolae per cell). These results indicate that expression of caveolin-2 alone is not sufficient to generate morphologically detectable caveolae in K562 cells. Caveolins-1 and -2 are normally co-expressed, and they form a stable high molecular mass hetero-oligomeric complex (5Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93"

Nitric oxide (NO) scavenger hemoglobin and N2O3 scavenger homocysteine abolished the SNAP-mediated c-Src kinase activation. Phosphoamino acid analysis and peptide mapping of in vitro labeled phospho-c-Src proteins revealed that SNAP promoted the autophosphorylation at tyrosine, which preferentially took place at Tyr-416. Peptide mapping of in vivo labeled c-Src kinase excluded the involvement of phospho-Tyr-527 dephosphorylation in the SNAP-mediated activation mechanism. Correspondingly, protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor Na3VO4 did not abolish the SNAP-mediated activation of Src kinase, and the constitutively activated v-Src kinase was also further up-regulated in activity by SNAP. SNAP, however, failed to up-regulate the kinase activity of Phe-416 mutant v-Src. 2-Mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, which should disrupt N2O3-mediated S-nitrosylation and subsequent formation of the S-S bond, abolished the up-regulated catalytic activity, and the activity was regained after re-exposing the enzyme to SNAP. Exposure of Src kinase to SNAP promoted both autophosphorylation and S-S bond-mediated aggregation of the kinase molecules, demonstrating a linkage between the two events. These results suggest that the NO/N2O3-provoked S-nitrosylation/S-S bond formation destabilizes the Src structure for Tyr-416 autophosphorylation-associated activation bypassing the Tyr-527-linked regulation. c-Src kinase was activated when either murine NIH3T3 fibroblast cells or immunoprecipitated c-Src proteins were treated with nitric oxide generator, S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) or sodium nitroprusside.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). In the resting fibroblasts, the activity of c-Src kinase is tightly controlled by phosphorylation, and the enzyme is found in an inactivated state in which the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine 527 (Tyr-527) is phosphorylated to high stoichiometry (3Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D.

A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On the other hand, v-Src kinase, which lacks a tail sequence containing Tyr-527, is not regulated by the phosphorylation. This is why uncontrolled and constitutively activated v-Src kinase plays a major role for unlimited cell growth (1Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S.

Recently, tertiary structures of c-Src kinase and related molecules were defined (8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-527 or binding of viral Nef protein with the SH3 domain has been suggested to destabilize the whole kinase structure for activation. It is still an open question whether some other chemical events could also destabilize the structure of the Src kinase for activation. Nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized enzymatically froml-arginine and molecular oxygen by nitric-oxide synthases (11Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) or NO-generating chemicals have been shown to affect a number of biological systems regulating various physiological and biochemical functions (12Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). Some of these include reduction of protein kinase C activity (13Gopalakrisna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27180-27185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of p21ras (14Lander H.M. Milbank A.J. Tauras J.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Schwartz G.D. Kraemer R.T.

Immunol. 1993; 150: 1509-1516PubMed Google Scholar) report that treatment of lymphoma cells with NO-generating agents increased the catalytic activity of p56lckkinase, possibly through potentiating the phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. The present study, to our knowledge, provides for the first time evidences that NO released from these chemicals activates Src kinase through a Tyr-527-independent and Tyr-416-linked mechanism, which involves S-nitrosylation/S-S bond-mediated modification of Src molecules. The murine NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line overexpressing c-Src kinase was kindly provided by Dr. D. Shalloway of Pennsylvania State University. v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells were from our own stock. The cell lines were cultured in plastic plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. After becoming confluent, cells were collected with 0.25% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline and were split into 60-mm plastic plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for a further 20–24-h incubation. The cells were then rinsed with fresh modified Eagle's medium twice and incubated in modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 1 h before use.S-Nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) was purchased from Research Biochemicals Int. (Natick, MA), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), hemoglobin, and dl-homocysteine were from Sigma. SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed as described elsewhere (16Nakashima I. Zhang Y-H. Rahman S.M.J. Yoshida T. Isobe K. Ding L. Iwamoto T. Hamaguchi M. Ikezawa H. Taguchi R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1153-1162PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins obtained from lysed cells or immunoprecipitates (see below) were resolved on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels and were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody (Transduction Lab., Lexington, KY) or anti-Src monoclonal antibody (mAb327, donated by Dr. J. S. Brugge, State University of New York; Ref. 17Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C and then with the appropriate second antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The proteins were visualized by Western blot Chemiluminescence Reagent (NEN Life Science Products) as directed by the manufacturer. The molecular sizes of the developed proteins were estimated by comparison with prestained protein markers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Cells were lysed with 1.0 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 ml Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and anti-Src monoclonal antibody (mAb327) was added to the supernatant. The immunoprecipitates were collected by incubating with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) that had been conjugated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (MBL, Nagoya, Japan). The beads bearing the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with cold lysis buffer and used for either immunoblot or in vitro kinase assay. In vitro kinase assay was done as described previously (18Hamaguchi M. Xiao H. Uehara Y. Ohnishi Y. Nagai Y. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 559-564PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the immunoprecipitated Src proteins were washed 3 times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2), suspended in the same buffer with 1.5 μg of acid-denatured enolase (Sigma) as an exogenous substrate, and radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP (370 kBq) (NEN Life Science Products). This mixture was further added with or without chemicals as modulators for kinase assay. The kinase reaction was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and was stopped by adding 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) unless otherwise noted. The immunoprecipitates were then heated in a boiling water bath for 3 min, and phosphoproteins were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for autoradiography. 32P-Labeled Src protein bands were cut from the dried gel and rehydrated with 50 mm NH4HCO3. After rehydration, gel slices were cut into smaller pieces and incubated at 37 °C overnight with the addition of 50 μg/ml proteinase K. After centrifugation the supernatant was freeze-dried, dissolved in 6 n HCl, and incubated at 85 °C for 1 h. The HCl was removed completely by repeated freeze-drying. The hydrolysates thus obtained were mixed with a mixture of marker amino acids containing phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine at a concentration of 1 mg/ml each. Samples were then analyzed in two dimensions on cellulose-coated glass plates (20 × 20 cm, Merck) by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 in the first dimension and pH 3.5 in the second dimension as described by Hunter and Sefton (19Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). After the second dimensional electrophoresis, plates were dried and marker phosphoamino acids were detected by staining with ninhydrin, and the labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. NIH3T3 cells were labeled in vivo with phosphorus-32 (H3PO4, 10 mCi/ml; NEN Life Science Products) in phosphorus-free medium with 2% fetal calf serum at a final concentration of 1 mCi/ml for 8 h as described previously (7Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Phosphorus-32-containing medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then lysed, and Src proteins were immunoprecipitated followed by analysis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The in vivo and in vitro labeled Src proteins were excised from the dried gel and digested with 50 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (CNBr, Sigma) in 70% formic acid at room temperature for 1 h. Products were lyophilized four or five times with 1 ml of distilled water until the pH became neutral. The cleaved peptides were subjected to electrophoresis on a 24% acrylamide, 0.054% bisacrylamide gel (20Schuh S.M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Imamoto A. Soriano P. Cell. 1993; 73: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film as described above. A cDNA clone containing the entire coding sequence of v-Src gene, obtained from Schimidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus, was inserted between Bam HI and Eco RI sites of pBabe puro. Mutation for tyrosine 416 to phenylalanine was introduced by polymerase chain reaction (22Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y.

In brief, primers containing the mutation was synthesized and used for amplification of v-Src sequences. The corresponding sequence of the v-Src gene was replaced with the mutated fragment. The mutated fragment was then sequenced to confirm that proper mutation was introduced. When NIH3T3 cells overexpressing c-Src were incubated with 100–1000 μm SNAP or SNP, a number of cellular proteins were phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue (Fig.1 A), and the c-Src kinase activity was elevated compared with that in untreated (Nil) cells (Fig. 1 B). The increase in catalytic activity of the kinase was shown for both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of enolase, which was used as an exogenous substrate. We next tested the direct effect of SNAP on the kinase activity of c-Src protein that had been isolated by immunoprecipitation from lysates of NIH3T3 cells. The results are shown in Fig. 1 C. Compared with no SNAP addition control (Nil), 5 and 50 μm SNAP definitely promoted the c-Src kinase activity as shown by elevated autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of enolase. As low concentration as 0.5 μm SNAP was also minimally effective, whereas its high concentration, e.g. 500 μm, did not elevate the kinase activity over the control level (data not shown). A similar but less marked effect was observed with another NO generator SNP (data not shown). A question arose whether the SNAP-mediated in vitro c-Src kinase activation was actually mediated by NO released from SNAP or its oxidized derivative N2O3, which may be in equilibrium with NO (24Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). We showed that the SNAP-mediated c-Src kinase activation was prevented both by NO scavenger hemoglobin (25Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Wood K.S. Byrns R.E. Chaudhuri G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 89: 1031-1035Google Scholar, 26Garg U.C. Hassid A. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1774-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1994) Google Scholar) and by N2O3 scavenger homocysteine (27Groot M.A.D. Testerman T. Xu Y. Stauffer G. Fang F.C. Science. 1996; 272: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 D). This result supported the view that NO, or more specifically, its oxidized derivative N2O3 was the ultimate effector. Hemoglobin treatment caused even lower phosphorylation of c-Src and enolase than the basal control (Nil). The concentration of SNAP needed for activation of Src kinase in cells (100–1000 μm; Fig. 1 B) was much higher than that for activation of the isolated enzyme (5–50 μm; Fig. 1, C and D). Therefore, we tested whether the high concentration of SNAP-induced increase in enzyme activity in cells was really mediated by NO released from SNAP. As shown in Fig.1 E, NO scavenger hemoglobin completely inhibited the SNAP-induced activation of Src kinase. There might also be a possibility that the increase in Src kinase activity of the cells treated with SNAP (See Fig. 1 B) was due to the NO action on Src molecules after cell lysis. To verify this we lysed the cells after stimulating with SNAP in the presence of hemoglobin to scavenge the possible action of NO after cell lysis. This treatment did not inhibit the in vivo SNAP effect to promote the enzyme activity (Fig.1 E), excluding the above mentioned possibility. We examined whether the promotion of c-Src kinase autophosphorylation by SNAP was at tyrosine residues. We performed phosphoamino acid analysis of c-Src kinase that had been excised from the dried gel after in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2 A, phosphorylation was only demonstrated at tyrosine but not at serine or threonine, and the phosphorylation at tyrosine was preferentially promoted by SNAP. This observation also indicated that the mechanism of the Src kinase activation mediated by SNAP does not involve an increase in phosphorylation at serine or threonine residues. We next performed the CNBr cleavage mapping of in vitro activated autophosphorylated c-Src kinase to define whether the elevated tyrosine phosphorylation was linked to phosphorylation at Tyr-416 or Tyr-527. The result, as shown in Fig. 2 B, indicated that only a 10-kDa peptide that should contain Tyr-416 (20Schuh S.M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) had been labeled with 32P, and SNAP treatment preferentially increased this labeling. From this result it is evident that SNAP activates the Src kinase in vitro linked to selective promotion of autophosphorylation at Tyr-416. c-Src kinase remains inactivated in the resting cells due to phosphorylation of its carboxyl-terminal tyrosine 527 (3Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D.

Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and the enzyme becomes activated when phospho-Tyr-527 is dephosphorylated (2Cooper J.A. Howell B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 3Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We then performed experiments to test whether phospho-Tyr-527 dephosphorylation would be involved in the mechanism of SNAP-mediated in vivo activation of Src kinase as shown in Fig. 1 B. Cells were labeled with 32P in the presence or absence of SNAP followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. CNBr cleavage mapping was done with the32P-labeled phosphorylated Src proteins that had been excised from the gel of SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.3, in vivo labeling occurred mainly on 4- and 31-kDa peptides that contain Tyr-527 and Ser-17, respectively (7Thomas J.E. Soriano P. Brugge J.S. Science. 1991; 254: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 20Schuh S.M. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SNAP treatment did not reduce the overall labeling of the 4-kDa peptide, suggesting that dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-527 is not involved in the SNAP-mediated in vivo Src kinase activation. Interestingly, an additional labeling developed on 10-kDa peptide containing Tyr-416 upon treatment with SNAP. This result may suggest that SNAP-mediated in vivo activation of Src kinase also involves Tyr-416 phosphorylation. There is a possibility that the potentially co-immunoprecipitated phosphotyrosine phosphatase, which dephosphorylates phospho-Tyr-527, could be involved in the mechanism of SNAP-mediated in vitro c-Src kinase activation. This is, however, not very likely, because c-Src proteins were prepared for in vitro kinase assay from the cell lysates in the lysis buffer containing Na3VO4, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. To further rule out this possibility we treated the immunoprecipitated c-Src protein again with Na3VO4 immediately before in vitro kinase assay. This treatment did not change the background levels of autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of enolase in the kinase assay without SNAP (data not shown) and barely reduced the ability of SNAP to activate Src kinase as shown in Fig.4 A. To further verify the influence of phospho-Tyr-527 dephosphorylation for the SNAP-mediated in vitro Src activation as a potential initiator, we tested the effect of SNAP on the kinase activity of v-Src, which does not contain the Tyr-527 residue. The result is shown in Fig. 4 B. To our surprise, v-Src kinase, which is constitutively activated (compare basal control levels for c-Src and v-Src), was further up-regulated in activity by SNAP (right panel). Moreover, the extent of SNAP-mediated increase in v-Src kinase activity was not less than that of c-Src kinase activity (left panel). These results suggested that the dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-527 is not a prerequisite for the Src kinase activation mediated by SNAP. To examine whether Tyr-416 autophosphorylation is the major event in SNAP-mediated in vitro activation of Src kinase, we prepared v-Src with a mutation at tyrosine 416, replacing with phenylalanine (Phe-416 mutant v-Src), and treated the mutated enzyme with SNAP for in vitro kinase assay. The background enzyme activity of the Phe-416 mutant v-Src to phosphorylate substrate was lower than that of the wild type v-Src. Unlike the wild type v-Src, the mutated enzyme was not up-regulated for the kinase activity to phosphorylate substrate after the addition of SNAP (Fig.5). This result strongly suggests that Tyr-416 autophosphorylation is crucially involved in both basic Src kinase activity and the SNAP-mediated promotion of the enzyme activity. The possible role of SH group(s) modification in the mechanism of SNAP-mediated Src kinase activation was then investigated. As expected from the earlier reports (28Lei S.Z. Pan Z. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.V. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 29Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Pan Z.H. Lei S.Z Chen S.H.V. Sucher N.J.

Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) on chemical properties of NO and related chemical compounds, we thought that NO released from SNAP or its oxidized derivative N2O3 would react with thiol group(s) of Src molecules to form protein-S-NO, which might eventually form disulfides (S-S) with vicinal thiols by oxidation-reduction processes. This change might underlie the mechanism of SNAP-induced Src kinase activation. If this is the case, disruption of S-S bond(s) originally formed by NO/N2O3 through S-nitrosylation would abolish the SNAP-mediated increase in the kinase activity. As shown in Figs.6 A (top) and 6 B, SNAP-activated c-Src kinase (lane 2) lost its high catalytic activity when treated with reducing agents such as 2-ME and dithiothreitol (lane 3), which should interrupt the NO/N2O3-mediated SH group modification forming S-S bond. It is noted that the treatment of the kinase with 2-ME also diminished the spontaneous increase in the catalytic activity of the kinase in vitro (compare lane 3 and lane 5 with lane 1 as control in Fig. 6 A). Surprisingly, however, by re-exposing the 2-ME-treated kinase after washing to SNAP, the catalytic activity of the enzyme was re-established (lane 4). During washing, after treating with 2-ME of the Src kinase, some of the proteins might have been lost. To verify this possibility we performed an immunoblot experiment using anti-Src antibody with individual samples. As shown in Fig.6 A (bottom), however, the amount of Src protein remained basically the same among the samples. These results suggested that the Src kinase was subjected to a reversible SH group modification for either activation or inactivation. A question arises here whether some oxidants would show similar effects or not. To verify this point, we added hydrogen peroxide to the isolated Src kinase for analyzing activity of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 6 C, hydrogen peroxide also activated Src kinase in a concentration-dependent manner. This result suggested that a redox mechanism possibly following S-nitrosylation with N2O3 for S-S bond formation would play an important role in the chemical pathway of Src kinase activation. We next conducted an experiment to ask if the Src proteins are actually subjected to modification due to S-S bond formation as a manifestation of the NO/N2O3-provoked mechanism. After incubation of c-Src proteins with or without SNAP together with [γ-32P]ATP for the kinase assay, the reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer plus or minus 2-ME. As shown in Fig.7, for both SNAP-untreated (Nil) and -treated assays, considerable amounts of autophosphorylated Src proteins were detected at the upper portion of the separating gel under unreducing conditions (right panel), which were dissociated under reducing condition (left panel). The ratio of aggregated to nonaggregated autophosphorylated Src proteins from the SNAP-treated assay, determined using appropriate computer software, was 1.61, which was higher than 0.94, the ratio of untreated control. This result evidenced the involvement of the S-S bond-mediated modification of the kinase molecules in the mechanism of the SNAP-induced kinase activation. Here for the first time we report evidences of an NO/N2O3-provoked redox-based chemical reaction-mediated, Tyr-416 autophosphorylation-linked mechanism for Src kinase activation, which bypasses the known phospho-Tyr-527 dephosphorylation- (2Cooper J.A.

This evidence includes 1) activation of c-Src kinase either in vivo (in cells) or in vitro by treatment with NO-releasing SNAP or SNP (Fig. 1, B and C) and inhibition by treatment with NO-scavenging hemoglobin and by N2O3-scavenging homocysteine (Fig. 1 D); 2) selective promotion by SNAP of phosphorylation at Tyr-416 of the Src kinase (Fig. 2); 3) no dephosphorylation of Tyr-527 after in vivo treatment of cells with SNAP (Fig. 3); 4) failure in prevention of the SNAP-mediated Src kinase activation with Na3VO4 as a phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (Fig. 4 A) and further activation by SNAP of constitutively activated Tyr-527-defective v-Src kinase (Fig. 4 B); 5) failure in promotion by SNAP of the kinase activity of Phe-416 mutant v-Src (Fig. 5); 6) mutually counteracting reversible controls of Src kinase activity by SNAP and reducing agents such as 2-ME (Fig. 6 A) and dithiothreitol (Fig. 6 B); 7) association of the SNAP-mediated Src kinase activation with promotion of S-S bond-mediated aggregation of the Src molecules (Fig. 7). The effective concentration of SNAP that increased the catalytic activity of Src kinase was 100–1000 μm for cells (Fig.1 B, Fig. 3) and 5–50 μm for isolated Src proteins (Fig. 1 C and others). We showed that activation of Src kinase by exposing the cells to 1000 μm SNAP (Fig.1 E) and by exposing isolated Src proteins to 50 μm SNAP (Fig. 1 C) was inhibited by NO scavenger hemoglobin. Activation of Src kinase by the latter was also prevented by N2O3 scavenger homocysteine. These results proved the involvement of NO and N2O3, a closely related oxidized derivative of NO, in the activation mechanism of both Src kinase in cells and isolated Src proteins. Earlier studies examined the release of NO from SNAP and SNP, showing that millimolar concentrations of these NO donors release free NO at concentrations in the physiological range (33Maccarrone M.

Blood. 1995; 86: 3211-3219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experimental system only a small portion of NO released from SNAP that was added to the culture of cells probably entered the cell to affect the intracellular Src kinase, and low concentrations (0.5–5 μm) of SNAP were shown to be effective in activating isolated Src kinase. Taken together, we consider that the effective concentration of NO released from SNAP in the present study can be physiologically relevant. It has been reported earlier that NO/N2O3 can aid S-S bond formation (28Lei S.Z. Pan Z. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.V. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar) through reaction of protein-SH with NO/N2O3 to generate protein-S-NO, which then oxidizes with another protein SH (28Lei S.Z. Pan Z. Aggarwal S.K. Chen H.V. Hartman J. Sucher N.J. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). This NO/N2O3-induced intermolecular S-S bond formation must underlie the SNAP-mediated Src protein aggregation that accompanied increased autophosphorylation, although NO/N2O3 might also induce Src protein modification by S-nitrosylation and subsequent intramolecular S-S bond formation. There are nine cysteines in c-Src and v-Src, some of which could be located in a position to be potentially modifiable externally. Our data suggest that reaction of NO/N2O3 with these cysteine residues facilitates formation of the S-S bond between Src molecules, thereby inducing their aggregation. The demonstrated aggregation of Src proteins due to intermolecular S-S bonds might mimic intracellular accumulation of those kinase proteins following ligand-mediated cross-linkage of cell surface receptors with which the kinase proteins should associate and that are thereby crucial for Src kinase activation. Recently defined tertiary structures of the Src and Src family kinases (8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Moarefi I.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) demonstrate that associations between the tail phospho-Tyr-527 (in case of c-Src) and SH2 domain and between the SH3 domain and kinase N-lobe domain connected by the SH2 kinase linker sequence stabilize the whole molecular structure of the kinase. This might put off the Tyr-416 (in the case of c-Src) phosphorylation-linked local switch in the kinase domain (40Yamagushi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of phospho-Tyr-527 or binding of the SH3 domain to some proline-rich sequences destabilizes the structure to turn the local switch on for activation (8Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar, 9Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 10Moarefi I.

Our present results suggest an alternative pathway to destabilize the kinase structure for activation through compelling individual Src molecules to interact with each other by S-S bond. We do not, however, exclude the possibility that some modification through S-nitrosylation and redox reaction for intramolecular S-S bond formation, which could occur in addition to intermolecular S-S bond formation, might also be involved in the mechanism of Src kinase activation. In any case, the newly demonstrated mechanism for Src kinase activation did not work at all on the F416 mutant Src kinase. It should therefore be that both, formerly known Tyr-527-dependent and new Tyr-527-independent, mechanisms put on the Tyr-416 phosphorylation-linked local switch for Src kinase activation. c-Src in resting cells is basically in an inactive form (3Cooper J.A. MacAuley A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4232-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 4Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D.

Cell. 1987; 49: 75-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) but is partially activated spontaneously due to a yet unexplained reason when isolated in vitro. Because treatment of the Src kinase with reducing agents in vitro reversibly diminished the catalytic activity and because the environment inside the cell is normally reducing, the reducing condition may be physiologically crucial for maintaining the kinase inactive in the resting cells. The demonstrated SH group modification or redox-linked mechanism could work when cells bearing Src kinase are put in the pathological microenvironment where NO/N2O3 or superoxide is produced by inflammatory cells in response to microorganism invasion. The same mechanism might also play a role in the yet unidentified physiological pathway of Src kinase activation, possibly providing the second messenger of the putative cell surface receptor-mediated signal. In short, the present results support the following summarized view. The Src molecule is normally stabilized under reducing conditions through intradomain association between SH2 and tail phospho-Tyr-527 and among SH3, SH2-kinase linker, and kinase N-lobe, which puts off the local switch for the kinase activation. At least two different mechanisms could destabilize the kinase structure to put on the Tyr-416 phosphorylation-linked local switch for increased catalytic activity. One is through dissociation of the tail from SH2 by phospho-Tyr-527 dephosphorylation, and another is through SH group or redox reaction-mediated modification of Src proteins including intermolecular S-S bond formation for their aggregation.

Although the promoter plays an important role in PSA expression, an experiment in transgenic mice has shown that it is insufficient to confer strong androgen responsiveness and cell type specificity in vivo. In the same experiment, however, a 6-kb region encompassing the promoter and extending further upstream was able to mediate proper regulation (14Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A.

Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The enhancer was originally identified as a 1.6-kb fragment containing, by sequence analysis, sites recognized by the androgen receptor, AP-1, cAMP-responsive element binding protein, and Fos (7Schuur E.R.

Two subsequent studies have further delineated the enhancer to an 822-bp fragment (3Pang S. Dannull J. Kaboo R. Xie Y. Tso C.L. Michel K. deKernion J.B. Belldegrun A.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 495-499PubMed Google Scholar) and a 455-bp minimal core region encompassing an androgen-responsive DNase I-hypersensitive site (6Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The role of the single identified ARE, termed ARE III, within this minimal core enhancer is not entirely clear. In one study, mutation of ARE III eliminated enhancer activity in transfection assays (6Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In a different study, however, mutation of ARE III in combination with ARE I of the promoter was required to abolish androgen responsiveness (11Zhang S. Murtha P.E. Young C.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although these results may reflect differences in methodology, we will show below that the enhancer is more complex than previously realized. We report that the enhancer contains multiple low affinity, non-consensus AREs, which bind AR cooperatively and act synergistically to stimulate transcription.AR is a 110-kDa protein containing an amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain (AF-1) spanning amino acids 141–338 (16Doesburg P.

AR is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. The remarkable homology of the conserved domains suggests that family members will activate transcription using conceptually similar mechanisms (24Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6292) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domain contains an additional activation domain (AF-2) by virtue of its homology to similar regions in related receptors and its ability to interact with co-activators (25Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Interaction between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal activation domains is thought to be important for full activity of AR (16Doesburg P. Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Steketee K. Faber P.W. Mulder E.

Expression of androgen-responsive genes is regulated by binding of ligand-activated AR to androgen response elements (AREs). Characterization of different AREs indicates that there are two classes of sites (23Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.J. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One group contains the 15-bp near-dyad, consensus sequence (GG(A/T)ACAnnnTGTTCT). The consensus also binds to and mediates transactivation by GR and PR. A second class of sites, however, has been identified with sequences that diverge considerably from the consensus. It is likely that these non-consensus sites contribute to specific binding by AR (8Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkman A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 35Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol.

Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.J. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It is unlikely, therefore, that AR alone regulates cell-type specificity of PSA gene expression. Indeed, DNase I footprinting and gel shift studies have identified several binding sites for prostate-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors within the PSA enhancer and promoter (7Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A. Kmetec L.A. Miller J.D. Lamparski H.G. Henderson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 9Riegman P.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3318-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is likely that a combination of AR and cell-specific factors confers tissue selectivity. One of the hallmarks of such regulation is the formation of nucleoprotein complexes that use cooperative DNA binding and transcriptional synergy to elicit specific patterns of gene expression (38Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).In an effort to understand the regulation of the PSA gene as a model for AR-mediated gene expression during prostate cancer, we undertook a biochemical analysis of the core enhancer. We employed DNase I footprinting to demonstrate that the enhancer contains a cluster of six closely spaced putative AREs differing in affinity for recombinant AR DNA binding domain (ARDBD). We systematically mutated these sites to demonstrate that at least four of the six sites were physiologically relevant in conferring response to AR in co-transfection assays into BHK and LNCaP cells. We then generated a retroviral construct encoding a FLAG-tagged version of AR, introduced it into HeLa and LNCaP cells, and isolated the receptor by immunoaffinity chromatography. We demonstrated by transactivation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding assays that the FLAG-tagged AR was biologically active in vivo and in vitro. Purified fAR bound cooperatively to the four core sites in the enhancer and responded to ARE mutants in a manner that roughly paralleled the in vivo transcriptional analysis. Conversely, PR did not substantially activate transcription from the core enhancer but did activate from a reporter bearing tandem AREs. We discuss how the cooperative binding to and synergistic activation of the enhancer by AR can contribute to the strong androgen responsiveness and cell selectivity of PSA gene expression.DISCUSSIONWe have employed the PSA gene as a model to understand how AR binds to and activates transcription of a natural target gene expressed during prostate cancer. Although previous studies had revealed the existence of two ARE sites within the proximal PSA promoter, the effect of the proximal promoter alone on the activity and tissue specificity of PSA gene expression is minor (3Pang S. Dannull J. Kaboo R. Xie Y. Tso C.L. Michel K. deKernion J.B. Belldegrun A.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 495-499PubMed Google Scholar, 6Cleutjens K.B. van der Korput H.A. van Eekelen C.C. van Rooij H.C. Faber P.W. Trapman J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 7Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A. Kmetec L.A. Miller J.D. Lamparski H.G. Henderson D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7043-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 15Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). More recent studies led to the view that the major control region is an enhancer centered ∼4.2 kb upstream of the PSA gene. Deletion mutagenesis around this region revealed that the androgen responsiveness of the enhancer is conferred by a 455-bp fragment bearing a single, moderate affinity ARE referred to as ARE III (centered at −4143). We subcloned this region upstream of a reporter gene and studied its response to AR. Our DNase I footprinting results, using both AR DNA binding domain and full-length AR, revealed that there are multiple AREs with varying but low affinities when compared with the consensus ARE. These sites were termed ARE IIIB, IIIA, III, IV, V, and VI and were centered at −3955, −4079, −4143, −4179, −4225, and −4298, respectively.We demonstrated that four of these nonconsensus AREs (IIIA, III, IV, and V), regardless of their low intrinsic affinity for AR, contribute significantly to the androgen-responsive transcriptional activity. Removal of these four sites strongly negated enhancer activity in LNCaP and in BHK cells, although the effects were less evident in BHK cells possibly due to high level overexpression of AR from the co-transfected effector plasmid or a lack of cell-specific factors. We found that fAR binds cooperatively to these sites in vitro. We have not excluded roles for the other two sites because mutagenesis of ARE IIIB and VI also decreases transcription in LNCaP cells (data not shown). It is clear from our study and others that mutation of many regions of the enhancer decreases its activity, and further work will be required to identify the proteins that bind these regions.The large difference in the size of the protected region by AR versus ARDBD was surprising. This effect could have multiple explanations including the following: (i) the existence of additional AREs that bind cooperatively to intact AR (i.e. such as the weakly protected site below site V); (ii) nonspecific interactions of AR with the intervening DNA, again mediated by cooperative interactions; (iii) finally, either a general distortion of the enhancer fragment or the larger mass of AR versus ARDBD might simply lead to steric inhibition of DNase I cleavage between the sites. The mutagenesis data support the idea that multiple AR molecules are cooperatively binding both specifically and nonspecifically along the DNA to provide a stable androgen-responsive nucleoprotein complex. This oligomerization, however, is dependent upon the identified AREs because mutagenesis of the four main AREs abolishes both specific and nonspecific binding.Cooperative binding of activators to multiple, adjacent low affinity sites and the resulting synergistic effects on gene expression are a common mechanism for ensuring specificity in the transcriptional response (38Carey M. Cell. 1998; 92: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In the case of the PSA enhancer the low affinity AREs may ensure that binding occurs only at a higher concentration of AR.In situ hybridization studies on rat tissues, for example, have shown that prostatic secretory epithelial cells are among two or three cell types expressing the highest levels of AR in the body (23Chang C. Saltzman A. Yeh S. Young W. Keller E. Lee H.J. Wang C. Mizokami A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expr. 1995; 5: 97-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The combination of the low affinity AREs and the high concentrations of AR may therefore provide a partial explanation for the cell type specificity of PSA expression.The presence of multiple AREs also augments the androgen responsiveness of the enhancer through synergy. Synergy is defined as the greater-than-additive transcriptional response to increasing numbers of bound activators. The current view is that synergy results from simultaneous interaction of multiple activators with the transcriptional machinery. These interactions lead to cooperative recruitment of the general machinery and the ensuing synergistic transcriptional response. In the case of the PSA enhancer, we imagine that simultaneous binding of multiple AR molecules is in part responsible for the synergistic androgen-dependent effect on PSA gene expression (8Cleutjens K.B. van Eekelen C.C. van der Korput H.A. Brinkman A.O. Trapman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6379-6388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This effect, when superimposed with a parallel synergistic effect of AR on AREs I and II within the proximal promoter (13Deleted in proof.Google Scholar) would, in principle, generate a sensitive and potent response of the gene to androgens.The use of nonconsensus sites to regulate gene expression has been widely observed in nature. The consensus is an artificial amalgam of sites from various steroid receptor-responsive elements and, as such, binds and mediates response to several related steroid receptors (i.e. AR, GR, mineral corricoid receptor, and PR). The specificity for a particular receptor is likely conferred by contextual interactions between a single site or combinations of sites and the receptor. Results shown in Fig. 4 support this notion. In line with previous observations that AR and PR share near identical consensus hormone response elements, we demonstrated that both AR and PR were able to efficiently induce the activity of a construct containing four consensus AREs. However, when tested on a construct containing the PSA enhancer, only AR was able to stimulate the activity. This leads us to conclude that nonconsensus sequences may play a pivotal role in conferring receptor specificity. Studies on GR, for example, have also established that the DNA sequence of the site influences nuclear receptor activity, possibly through conformational changes in the ligand binding domain (49Starr D.B. Matsui W. Thomas J.R. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 50Lefstin J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Furthermore, natural low affinity sites that bind AR are commonplace. In one case, the ARE in the rat probasin gene was shown to display an inherent preference for AR over GR suggesting that nonconsensus changes in DNA sequence may represent a basic mechanism for conferring receptor specificity (35Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Contextual cooperative interactions involving interplay between multiple AREs and domains of AR also regulate specificity. In an elegant study that emphasized the complex nature of receptor DNA binding specificity, Robins and colleagues(36) studied the DNA binding properties of domain-swap chimeras of AR and GR. The target promoters included both a standard array of consensus steroid (hormone) response elements and the natural AR-responsive enhancer of the sex-limited protein (slp) gene of mice. Whereas the different chimeras bound to and functioned from standard steroid response elements (36Scheller A. Hughes E. Golden K.L. Robins D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24216-24222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), AR bound tightly and cooperatively to the nonconsensus slp enhancer AREs. The most efficient cooperativity required the AR DNA binding domain and its natural ligand and amino-terminal domains. The ligand and amino-terminal domains could not be substituted by the analogous domains of GR, which appeared to, in fact, suppress specific enhancer binding. The study implied that contextual AR-AR and AR-DNA interactions occurring within the nucleoprotein complex on the slp enhancer are the key determinants of specificity. Such contextual protein-protein interactions may also explain the inability of PR to activate the PSA enhancer.Although contextual, cooperative AR-AR interactions are likely to contribute to the specificity of PSA gene expression, other mechanisms must exist to ensure an accurate, cell-specific transcriptional response. Indeed, DNase I footprinting studies have identified binding sites for prostate-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors within the PSA enhancer and promoter (7Schuur E.R. Henderson G.A.

It was speculated that some of these complexes located between −4150 and −4000 were due to binding of AR, a finding supported by our data since this region contains site IIIA. However, other complexes within the enhancer appeared unique and may represent binding of prostate-specific factors. Indeed, Farmer and Freedman 2G. Farmer and L. Freedman, personal communication.recently identified a prostate-specific factor, which appears to bind adjacent to our ARE IV. Our footprint assay using crude LNCaP nuclear extracts also demonstrates that in addition to regions around ARE IV, other regions indicated by asterisks in Fig. 10 are protected by extracts from both R1881-treated and -untreated cells. Our data combined with others strongly suggest that additional factors exist to modulate the enhancer activity. These factors may function by interacting with AR in the context of the nucleoprotein complex, an issue we are currently investigating.Mechanistic studies on nuclear receptors suggest that they stimulate transcription by direct or indirect communication with the general factors (51Hori R. Carey M. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Direct interactions between the general factors and several nuclear receptors including AR have been detected biochemically (52Ing N.H. Beekman J.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

In addition to general factor interactions the current view is that the receptor also interacts with ancillary factors called co-activators to increase the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery. For example, CBP/p300 has been found to support activation by many nuclear receptors including AR (56Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Schulman I.G. Juguilon H. Montminy M.

In addition, co-activators for individual nuclear receptors have been isolated using both biochemical assays and yeast two-hybrid screens. Examples include the TRAPs for the thyroid hormone receptor (45Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A CoaR mutant (Ser-Asn-Ser) in a carboxyl-terminal Cys-His-Cys motif bound the coaT operator-promoter but did not activate expression in response to cobalt, implicating thiolate and/or imidazole ligands at these residues in an allosteric cobalt binding site.

Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the absence of mercury, MerR represses transcription (∼2-fold). Several lines of evidence support a model in which mercury-MerR activates transcription by realigning abnormally spaced consensus RNA polymerase recognition sequences via underwinding the mer operator-promoter (3Ansari A.Z.

Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. et al.DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar) is an ORF,1 sll0794, herein designated coaR, encoding a predicted protein with some sequence similarity to MerR. The amino-terminal one-third of CoaR, which aligns with MerR, is followed by a polypeptide with sequence similarity to precorrin isomerase (see Fig. 1), a methyl transferase involved in the synthesis of the cobalt-containing corrin ring of vitamin B12 (6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Unlike Synechocystis PCC 6803, many organisms do not contain the genes for vitamin B12 biosynthesis, and such organisms have no requirement for cobalt (7Fraústo da Silva J.J.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements: The Inorganic Chemistry of Life. Clarendon Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). Precorrin isomerase from Pseudomonas denitrificans is known to bind avidly to its product, hydrogenobyrinic acid, which consequently co-purifies with the enzyme (8Thibaut D. Couder M. Famechon A. Debussche L. Cameron B. Crouzet J. Blanche F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that a domain of CoaR interacts with hydrogenobyrinic acid. Divergently transcribed from coaR is an ORF, slr0797, designated coaT, encoding a putative P-type ATPase (Fig.1). CoaT has some sequence features of P1- (9Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) or CPx-type ATPases (10Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) but lacks an amino-terminal metal binding motif and, most significantly, contains a deduced intramembranous Ser-Pro-Cys motif rather than the characteristic Cys-Pro-Cys/His/Ser (CPx). Known CPx-type ATPases transport larger metal ions and include the cadmium transporter CadA, the yeast copper transporter CCC2, the human copper transporters MNK and WND, the bacterial copper transporters CtaA, PacS, CopA, and CopB (reviewed in Ref. 11Silver S. Phung L.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 753-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1063) Google Scholar), and the zinc transporter ZiaA from Synechocystis PCC 6803 (12Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and ZntA from Escherichia coli (13Beard S.J. Hashim R. Membrillo-Hernández J.

At present, it is not possible to predict which metal ion is transported in which direction, import or export, merely from the sequence of a CPx-type ATPase, but the divergent organization of coaR and coaT encourages the prediction that the product of the former regulates the latter. Here we describe experiments that confirm that CoaR does bind to and activate expression from the coaT operator-promoter. The activating effector is shown to be cobalt, and CoaT is shown to confer cobalt resistance and exclusion. Following site-directed mutagenesis, it was revealed that a carboxyl-terminal Cys-His-Cys motif in CoaR is part of the cobalt-sensing site. A partial mutant in the vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathway at a step preceding precorrin isomerase was generated. Enhanced expression from the coaT operator-promoter in this mutant indicates that this pathway inhibits coaT transcription and that CoaR responds to both activating and inhibitory effectors to attune cobalt export with fluctuations in cellular demand as well as with changing cobalt levels. Synechocystis PCC 6803 was grown in liquid BG-11 medium (15Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) or on medium C plates with supplement A5 (16Kratz W.A. Myers J. Am. J. Bot. 1995; 42: 282-287Crossref Google Scholar) using previously described conditions (17Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transformed to antibiotic resistance essentially as described by Hagemann and Zuther (18Hagemann M. Zuther E. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 429-434Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). E. coli strains JM101 or SURE (Stratagene) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Standard DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA, isolated as described previously (17Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template for PCR with primers 1 (5′- GAACCCGGGCACTAAAGACAAGTGAG-3′) and 2 (5′-GAAGAATTCTGGATTTTTACCTTCTCAGCC-3′). The amplification product (1.2 kb) containing coaR and the coaT operator-promoter was ligated into the Hin cII/Eco RI site of pSK+(Stratagene) to create pJRJC1.1, then subcloned into the Bam HI/Sal I site of pLACPB2 (20Scanlan D.J. Bloye S.A. Mann N.H. Hodgson D.A. Carr N.G. Gene. 1990; 90: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to create pLACOA. A derivative of pLACOA was generated in which codon 10 of coaR was converted from GAA to an ochre stop codon. Primer 5′-CCCACTGCATCTGTGAGTTAACTAATCGTTAAGTGATTAG-3′ and its reverse complement were used for Quik Change (Stratagene) mutagenesis with pJRJC1.1 as template, creating pJRJC2.1, and the coa sequences were then subcloned into the Bam HI/Sal I site of pLACPB2 to create pLACOA-OCH. Two derivatives of pLACOA and pLACOA-OCH were generated with 1 or 2 nucleotides (δ1 or δ2, see Fig. 7 A) removed from the coaT operator-promoter. pJRJC1.1 and pJRJC2.1 were used as templates for Quik Change with primer 5′-CCTTCTCAGCCTAACCTTAACATTAGTGTCAATGTC-3′ and its reverse complement for the δ1 deletion, or 5′-GACATTGACACTAATGTTAAGGTAGGCTGAGAAGG-3′ and its reverse complement for δ2, and the coa sequences were subcloned into the Bam HI/Sal I site of pLACPB2. A further derivative of pLACOA was generated in which codons 363 to 365 of coaR, encoding Cys-His-Cys, were converted to encode Ser-Asn-Ser. Primer 5′-CATTGATTGCAAAGCCAGATTCGAATTCCTATCTCACTTGTCTTTAGTGC-3′ and its reverse complement were used for Quik Change with pJRJC1.1 as template, and the coa sequences were subcloned into the Bam HI/Sal I site of pLACPB2. Plasmid pCSCM2 facilitates the integration of translational fusions to lac Z into the Synechocystis PCC 6803 genome (within ORF slr0168) (21Milkowski C. Quinones A. Hagemann M. Curr. Microbiol. 1998; 37: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The Sac I/Pst I fragment from pCSCM2 (containing the truncated 5′ end of lacZ) was replaced with the Sac I/Pst I fragment from pLACOA to generate pJRNR1.1, containing the entire lacZ coding region and Shine-Dalgarno motif. The coa sequences from pJRJC1.1 were subcloned into the Pst I/Sal I site of pJRNR1.1 to create a transcriptional fusion to lacZ. The resulting plasmid, pJRNR1.2, was used to transform Synechocystis PCC 6803 to kanamycin resistance, generating strain JRNR1.2. JRNR1.2 showed no difference in cobalt tolerance to wild type. As a control, lacZ with no associated coa sequences was introduced into Synechocystis PCC 6803 via transformation with pCSCM2 containing full-length lacZ derived from pLACPB2. Synechocystis PCC 6803 cultures (final A595 of 0.18 to 0.35) were exposed (∼20 h) to a range of metal ions under standard growth conditions except where stated otherwise. Overnight cultures of E. coli were diluted 100-fold in fresh medium supplemented with a range of metal ions and grown to an A595of 0.2 to 0.5. Assays (22Morby A.P. Turner J.S. Huckle J.W. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) were carried out in triplicate and performed on at least three separate occasions (nine analyses). Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR with primers 1 and 5′-GAAGAATTCTAACAGGGCTTAGAGCGTG-3′, and the amplification product (3.3 kb), containing coaR and coaT, was ligated to pGEM-T (Promega) to create pJRNR2.1. A 1.3-kb Bam HI fragment of pUK4K (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing a kanamycin resistance gene was ligated to the Eco NI site of pJRNR2.1 (within coaT) to create pIN-COAT. pIN-COAT transformants of Synechocystis PCC 6803, designated Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT), were selected on solid medium containing 20 μg ml−1 kanamycin before growth in liquid medium containing 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin. pJRNR2.1 was used to reintroduce coaT into the chromosome of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT), and transformants were selected on medium supplemented with 10 μm cobalt (no kanamycin). Synechocystis PCC 6803 genomic DNA was used as template for PCR with primers 3 (5′-GAAGAATTCTAGCTTCCGGTGATCC-3′) and 5′-GAAGAATTCGATCGCCACTGACC-3′, and the amplification product (0.6 kb), containing part of cbiE (ORF sll0099), was ligated to pGEM-T creating pJRNR3.1. pSU19 (23Martinez E. Bartolome B. de la Cruz F. Gene. 1988; 68: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) was used as a template for PCR with primers 5′-GAAGATATCGTAAGTTGGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATATCGGCACCAATAACTG-3′, and the amplification product (0.9 kb) containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene cat was ligated to pGEM-T to create pJRNR3.2. An Eco RV fragment of pJRNR3.2 containing cat was then ligated to the Hin dIII site of pJRNR3.1 (within cbiE) to create pJRNR3.3, which was used to transform JRNR1.2 to chloramphenicol resistance (7.5 μg ml−1). The genotype of transformants was checked by PCR using primers 3 and 5′-GATTAACCGTTGACCAGCGCTAG-3′, which anneal to cbiE sequences flanking the site of cat insertion. The detected products revealed transformants to be merodiploid, with some chromosomes retaining cbiE and others containing cat within cbiE, with analogy to previous attempts to disrupt an essential cyanobacterial gene (24Bird A.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Lakey J.H. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21246-21252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing cells were subcultured daily (to ∼1 × 106 cells ml−1) for a minimum of 7 days before analyses (to standardize growth rates). Growth of cultures in metal-supplemented BG-11 medium was examined as described (17Turner J.S. Morby A.P. Whitton B.A. Gupta A. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4494-4498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine cobalt accumulation, cultures (∼5 × 108 cells) were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of fresh BG-11 medium supplemented with 2 μm cobalt and 1 kBq of 57Co, and incubated for 1 h under standard growth conditions. 57Co-exposed cells were pelleted and washed twice with fresh medium, and the periplasmic contents were extracted into two osmotic shock fractions (25Ames G.F.-L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out in triplicate, and 57Co compartmentalization was examined on three separate occasions. CoaR and mutants thereof were expressed from the coaR operator-promoter in E. coli cells containing pLACOA (or derivatives described above). In addition, recombinant CoaR was also generated in E. coli as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase. Synechocystis PCC 6803 DNA was used as template for PCR with primers 1 and 5′-GAAGGATCCGGATGAAGACTAATCACTTAACG-3′. The amplification product (1.1 kb), containing coaR, was ligated to pGEM-T before subcloning into the Bam HI/Sma I site of the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector pGEX-3X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to create pGEXCoaR. Recombinant fusion protein was expressed in E. coli (JM101) and purified according to manufacturer's protocols. Extracts from E. coli cells containing pGEXCoaR were fractionated on glutathione Sepharose 4B, and a single protein of ∼69.6 kDa, corresponding to the predicted size of glutathione S-transferase-CoaR, was detected in fractions containing 5 mm glutathione. Incubation of recombinant protein overnight with factor Xa released a smaller protein corresponding to the predicted size (40.6 kDa) of CoaR plus three residues of glutathione S-transferase. In some preparations a further fragment was also detected, presumed to result from internal cleavage within CoaR; the factor Xa and incubation time were optimized to minimize this. Assays were performed with 0.5 mm spermidine in the binding buffer as described previously (26Turner J.S. Glands P.D. Samson A.C.R. Robinson N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3714-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed using Tris-borate-EDTA (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) buffer. A 77-bp Bam HI/Eco RI DNA fragment containing the coa operator-promoter was used as probe. This fragment was released from pSK+ containing the PCR product generated using primers 2 and 5′-GAAGGATCCCTTTAGTTTACTC-3′ with pJRJC1.1 as template. To identify which, if any, metal ions repress or induce transcription from the coaT operator-promoter, 1.2 kb from upstream of coaT (including the coaT operator-promoter and coaR) were fused to a promoterless lacZ gene to generate plasmid pJRNR1.2. The transcriptional fusion in plasmid pJRNR1.2 is flanked by sequences from Synechocystis PCC 6803, which facilitated integration by homologous recombination into a remote chromosomal site to generate strain JRNR1.2. After exposure to biologically significant concentrations of various metal ions, maximum induction of β-galactosidase activity was observed with elevated cobalt (Fig.2). A greater than 10-fold reduction in β-galactosidase activity was observed when cells were cultured in modified BG-11 medium devoid of micronutrient (0.15 μm) cobalt, and the consequent response to cobalt was enhanced (Fig.2 B). No induction of β-galactosidase activity was detected using control cells containing lacZ alone (Fig.2 B). The observation that elevated cobalt enhances transcription from the coaT operator-promoter suggests that coaT may export, and confer resistance to, cobalt. Mutants, Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT), with disrupted coaT were generated by integration of plasmid pIN-COAT, which contains coaT interrupted by a kanamycin resistance gene. Growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) and wild type was tested in multiple liquid cultures supplemented with a range of levels of cobalt, cadmium, copper, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc to determine maximum permissive concentrations (data not shown). Only resistance to cobalt appeared to be reduced in Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT). Subsequently, growth was examined as a function of time in response to selected concentrations of cobalt and three metals, which are known to be transported by CPx-type ATPases (Fig. 3 A). Again, only resistance to cobalt was reduced. Restoration of cobalt tolerance was also used as a selectable marker to identify mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) in which coaT had reintegrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination. The genotypes of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) and the mutant with reintegrated coaT were confirmed by Southern analysis; the band of lower Mr represents hybridization to coaR on a smaller fragment, due to the disruption of coaT introducing an additional restriction site (Fig. 3 B). Fig.3 C shows the phenotypes of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT), wild type and cells with coaT reintroduced into the chromosome, on agar plates. Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) and wild type cells were exposed for 1 h to 1 kBq of 57Co in medium containing 2 μm cobalt. More 57Co was located in the cytoplasm of Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT) compared with wild type cells (Table I), with equivalent observations being made on two further occasions (data not shown). The disruption of coaT impairs the exclusion of cobalt from the cytoplasm.Table ICompartmentalization of cobalt in wild type and Synechocystis PCC 6803(coaT)FractionAccumulated cobaltWild typeSynechocystis PCC 6803(coaT)pmol cobalt mg protein−1Cytoplasm442 ± 17656 ± 26Periplasm817 ± 31658 ± 31EDTA wash5290 ± 2904944 ± 85The means and S.D. of triplicate estimations of the amount of cobalt in the cytoplasm, periplasm (osmotic shock fraction), and EDTA wash fraction (before osmotic shock) of cells exposed to 2 μmCo2+ for 1 h.

A single complex formed between the coa operator-promoter and extracts from Synechocystis PCC 6803 (Fig.4). Fig.5 B confirms that a single complex is also formed between the coa operator-promoter and total protein from E. coli cells containing pLACOA, whereas, most importantly, this complex is absent when protein is used from cells containing pLACOA-OCH (pLACOA containing a stop codon within the coaR ORF). The complex remains stable in reactions containing 0.1 μg μl−1 of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) competitor DNA (Figs. 4 and 5 B). This represents a 1 × 105-fold excess of nonspecific competitor DNA to coa probe DNA and establishes the specificity of the complex. A similarly migrating complex was also detected with purified recombinant CoaR along with faster migrating complexes, attributed to internal factor Xa cleavage within CoaR (data not shown).Figure 5Metal-induced expression from the coaT operator-promoter in E. coli. Panel A, E. coli (JM101) containing pLACOA (filled bars) or pLACOA-OCH (open bars) were grown with no metal supplement or in the presence of maximum noninhibitory concentrations of Ag+ (50 μm), Cd2+ (0.1 mm), Co2+ (0.1 mm), Cu2+ (0.8 mm), Hg2+ (4 μm), Ni2+ (0.8 mm), or Zn2+ (0.1 mm). Panel B, gel retardation assays were performed using ∼2 fmol of32P-labeled 77-bp coa operator-promoter as probe with 0.1 μg μl−1 poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and ∼6 μg of protein extract from E. coli containing pLACOA-OCH (lane 1), pLACOA (lane 2), a variant of pLACOA with mutated (C363S/H364N/C365S) coaR (lane 3), or variants of pLACOA with the δ1 (lane 4) or δ2 (lane 5) deletions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In all media, other than that supplemented with cobalt, E. coli cells containing pLACOA show reduced (∼50%) β-galactosidase activity compared with cells containing pLACOA-OCH, with a stop codon introduced within coaR (Fig.5 A). Cells containing pLACOA show highly elevated β-galactosidase activity in media supplemented with maximum noninhibitory concentrations of cobalt, and under these conditions, activity in these cells is substantially greater than that observed in cells containing pLACOA-OCH. CoaR activates expression from the coaT operator-promoter in the presence of cobalt, whereas in other conditions, it mediates some repression. E. coli is unable to synthesize the corrin ring of vitamin B12 (27Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), the relevant genes being absent. Thus, intermediates in this pathway (e.g. hydrogenobyrinic acid) cannot be required for cobalt-dependent positive regulation by CoaR. The carboxyl-terminal 12 residues of CoaR are unlike MerR or precorrin isomerase and include the sequence Cys-His-Cys. Such residues can form metal-thiolate and metal-imidazole bonds and were therefore hypothesized to coordinate cobalt in CoaR. To test whether this motif is required for cobalt-sensing, a variant of pLACOA was generated in which codons 363 and 365, encoding Cys, were converted to encode Ser, whereas codon 364 was converted to encode Asn. Extracts from E. coli cells containing this construct showed equivalent retardation of the coa operator-promoter as extracts containing nonmutant CoaR (Fig. 5 B), confirming that the mutant C363S/H364N/C365S protein is synthesized and can bind to DNA. In the absence of added cobalt, β-galactosidase activity in cells containing mutant CoaR was less than in cells containing pLACOA-OCH (data not shown) and similar to that observed in cells containing pLACOA (Fig.6), confirming that the mutant C363S/H364N/C365S protein reduces basal expression from the coaT operator-promoter. Most importantly, cobalt-dependent activation was absent in cells containing the mutant CoaR, revealing that the carboxyl-terminal Cys-His-Cys motif is indeed required for cobalt sensing. Known proteins that share sequence similarity to MerR from Tn501 include mercury sensors from other sources (28O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1993; 261: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), the redox sensor SoxR (29Hidalgo E. Leautaud V. Demple B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the thiostrepton sensor TipAL (30Chiu M.L. Folcher M. Griffin P. Holt T. Klatt T. Thompson C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), BmrR and BltR from Bacillus subtilis (31Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vázquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and NolA from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (32Sadowsky M.J. Cregan P.B. Gottfert M. Sharma A. Gerhold D. Rodriguez-Quinones F. Keyser H.H. Hennecke H. Stacey G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These proteins are known, or predicted, to associate with promoters in which consensus −10 and −35 elements are separated by 19 or 20 bp rather than 16 to 18 bp. The removal of nucleotides from between such elements revealed that suboptimal spacing is essential for normal regulation of mer transcription, with nucleotide deletions leading to constitutive enhanced expression (33Parkhill J. Brown N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5157-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By analogy, 20 bp separate near consensus −10 and −35 sequences in the coaT operator-promoter region (Fig. 7 A). A degenerate (1 bp mismatch in 13) hyphenated (6 bp) inverted repeat (13-6-13) (Fig.7 A) in this region contains candidate nucleotides for CoaR binding. To test the importance of suboptimal spacing for regulation of transcription from the coaT operator-promoter, variants of constructs pLACOA and pLACOA-OCH were created in which either 1 (δ1) or 2 (δ2) bp were deleted (Fig. 7 A). A single complex with the coaT operator-promoter was detected using extracts from these cells (Fig. 5 B). The δ2 construct conferred highly elevated constitutive β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 7 B). Elevated expression was also observed with the δ1 construct, although it was notable that under these conditions the presence of CoaR was inhibitory even in the presence of cobalt. Shortening of the promoter spacing similarly converted the MerR-like redox sensor SoxR from an activator into a repressor regardless of the presence of inducer (34Hildago E. Demple B.

It is proposed that CoaR functions in an analogous manner to MerR but remodels its target promoter in response to elevated cobalt rather than mercury. To test the proposal that interaction between the precorrin isomerase-like domain of CoaR and intermediates in the vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathway modulates expression from the coaT operator-promoter, β-galactosidase activity was examined in a mutant of strain JRNR1.2 in which the cbiE gene was insertionally inactivated on a proportion of chromosomes. β-Galactosidase activity was elevated in the cbiE mutant compared with JRNR1.2 (Fig.8 A), revealing that the vitamin B12 pathway mediates repression of transcription from the coaT operator-promoter. Cobalt-transporting CPx-type ATPases have not previously been described. Several lines of evidence indicate that CoaT exports this metal ion. Cobalt is the most potent inducer of transcription from the coaT operator-promoter (Figs. 2 and 5 A), insertional inactivation of coaT reduces tolerance to cobalt (Fig. 3 A), restoration of cobalt tolerance by coaT can be used as a selectable marker (Fig.3 B), and cells lacking functional coaT have increased accumulation of 57Co in the cytoplasm (Table I). Eight trans-membrane α-helices are predicted for CoaT (Fig. 1), and a Ser-Pro-Cys motif is located in the sixth helix, 42 residues away from a deduced aspartyl kinase site (DKTGT). This is normally the location of the CPx motif, which is thought to associate with larger metal ions during membrane transit, whereas alternative residues flank the conserved proline within this motif in transporters of alkali and alkaline earth metals (10Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 237-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). The SPC-variant motif in CoaT may contribute toward specificity for cobalt. It is known that a metallochaperone can interact with, and donate metal ions to, the amino-terminal metal binding motifs of a CPx-type ATPase (35Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.-J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Cizewski-Culotta V. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), and the absence of such sequences in CoaT implies an absence of analogous cobalt transfer. Association of CoaR with the coaT operator-promoter influences transcriptional activity both negatively, in the absence, and positively, in the presence, of elevated concentrations of cobalt, respectively (Fig. 5). A 20-bp spacing between consensus promoter elements impairs expression from the coaT operator-promoter and is essential for positive regulation by CoaR (Fig. 7). Deformation of the coaT operator-promoter by cobalt-CoaR, compensating for abnormal spacing, is the inferred mechanism of transcriptional switching. The possibility that activated SoxR/MerR may also interact directly with RNA polymerase has not been eliminated (29Hidalgo E. Leautaud V. Demple B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2629-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), although for cobalt-CoaR, such an interaction would imply a capacity to recognize both Synechocystis PCC 6803 and E. coli RNA polymerase. Sequence similarity to precorrin isomerase initially suggested that CoaR may be solely effected by intermediates in vitamin B12 biosynthesis, but activation in E. coli (Fig. 5) supports direct interaction with cobalt. Retention of repression, but loss of cobalt-dependent activation (Fig.6), in a Ser-Asn-Ser mutant of the carboxyl-terminal Cys-His-Cys motif of CoaR implicates cobalt association with thiol and/or imidazole groups of one or more of these residues in transcriptional switching. The apparent affinity of mercury-MerR for the mer operator-promoter is 4-fold less than apo-MerR (4Parkhill J. Ansari A.Z. Wright J.G. Brown N.L. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and this will favor the replacement of mercury-MerR with apo-MerR and, hence, deactivation following removal of cellular mercury. It is notable that a pair of His residues (residues 26 and 28) are located within the deduced helix-turn-helix DNA binding region of CoaR, and it is formally possible that these constitute part of a site that reduces DNA association upon metal binding with some analogy to a model for metal-mediated DNA dissociation by ArsR/SmtB/CadC/ZiaR-like metal-responsive repressors (12Thelwell C.

Unlike mercury, cobalt is essential (at least in some organisms), and after deactivation of export, some cellular cobalt may be retained. The action of cbiE reduces expression from the coaT operator-promoter (Fig. 8 A). In a cbiE mutant there will be a reduction in levels of substrate for precorrin isomerase (precorrin-8x) and product (hydrogenobyrinic acid) when enzymes are substrate limited. In P. denitrificans it is known that hydrogenobyrinic acid precedes the step of cobalt insertion into the corrin ring (6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and is predicted to accumulate when there is insufficient cobalt for vitamin B12 biosynthesis. An inhibition of CoaT production when hydrogenobyrinic acid accumulates will restrict cobalt export when there is cellular demand (Fig. 8 D). Thus, via responses to two effectors, (i) cobalt (positive effector) and (ii) intermediates in the vitamin B12 pathway (negative effector), CoaR integrates cobalt homeostasis with metabolism. Enzyme recruitment (39Hawkins A.R. Lamb H.K. Moore J.D. Roberts C.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) is exemplified by the evolution of the latter response. It is predicted that binding of hydrogenobyrinic acid to the precorrin isomerase domain of CoaR prevents cobalt-mediated conformational change required for activation, possibly occluding the cobalt binding site. Adjacent to the coa divergon in Synechocystis PCC 6803 is a deduced operon, starting with ORF slr0793, with similarity to cnr and czc operons, both of which mediate export of metal ions, including cobalt, across the inner and outer membranes (40Nies D.H. Brown N.L. Silver S. Walden W. Metal Ions in Gene Regulation. Chapman & Hall, New York1998: 77-103Crossref Google Scholar). Does transport by CoaT facilitate storage of excess cytoplasmic cobalt in the periplasm while the adjacent genes mediate export across the outer membrane upon saturation of periplasmic stores (Fig.8 E)? It is now apparent that CoaR senses cobalt (Fig. 5) and some of the residues involved in cobalt sensing have been identified (Fig. 6). During the course of this work, a MerR-like protein from E. coli has been shown to activate transcription from the zntA operator-promoter in response to zinc (41Brocklehurst K.R. Hobman J.L. Lawley B. Blank L. Marshall S.J. Brown N.L. Morby A.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and a similar activity suggested for a homologue from Proteus mirabilis (42Noll M. Petrukhin K. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21393-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It will be intriguing to determine how/if responses of ZntR are modified coincident with fluctuating requirements for zinc. Clearly there is a subfamily of MerR-like proteins that switch transcription in response to metal ions, mercury, cobalt, and zinc sensors having now been identified. It is probable that there are further members specific for other metals, which await discovery. It is also now apparent that CoaT is a cobalt-transporting variant CPx-type ATPase, adding to the catalogue of resistances (cadmium, copper, zinc, and lead) known to be mediated by these proteins. The next challenge will be to understand metal-specificity. We thank Martin Hagemann for an essential strain, plasmid, and advice."

In order to delineate signaling pathways that link the receptor to the regulation of MAP kinase, the human A2A receptor was heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and HEK293 cells. In both cell lines, A2A agonist-mediated cAMP accumulation was accompanied by activation of the small G protein rap1. However, rap1 mediates A2A receptor-dependent activation of MAP kinase only in CHO cells, the signaling cascade being composed of Gs, adenylyl cyclase, rap1, and the p68 isoform of B-raf. This isoform was absent in HEK293 cells. Contrary to CHO cells, in HEK293 cells activation of MAP kinase by A2A agonists was not mimicked by 8-bromo-cAMP, was independent of Gαs, and was associated with activation of p21ras. Accordingly, overexpression of the inactive S17N mutant of p21ras and of a dominant negative version of mSos (the exchange factor of p21ras) blocked MAP kinase stimulation by the A2A receptor in HEK 293 but not in CHO cells. In spite of the close homology between p21ras and rap1, the S17N mutant of rap1 was not dominant negative because (i) overexpression of rap1(S17N) failed to inhibit A2A receptor-dependent MAP kinase activation, (ii) rap1(S17N) was recovered in the active form with a GST fusion protein comprising the rap1-binding domain of ralGDS after A2A receptor activation, and (iii) A2A agonists promoted the association of rap1(S17N) with the 68-kDa isoform of B-raf in CHO cells. We conclude that the A2A receptor has the capacity two activate MAP kinase via at least two signaling pathways, which depend on two distinct small G proteins, namely p21ras and rap1.

Hypoxia leads to accumulation of excessive amounts of the nucleoside. In the extracellular space, adenosine serves as an autacoid that regulates the function of virtually every organ and tissue via four different classes of G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, designated A1-, A2A-, A2B, and A3-adenosine receptor (1Collis M.G. Hourani S.M.O. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 360-366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). These differ by their affinity for the endogenous agonist as well as by their pharmacological specificity. In addition, they operate through distinct signaling mechanisms. The A1- and A3-adenosine receptors control most, if not all, their cellular effectors via pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins of the Gi and Go family; in contrast, both A2A- and A2B-adenosine receptors couple to Gs and thereby stimulate cAMP formation (2Fredholm B.B. Abbracchio M.P. Burnstock G. Daly J.W. Harden T.K. Jacobson K.A. Leff P. Williams M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 143-156PubMed Google Scholar). In primary cultures of endothelial cells from various species and vascular beds, adenosine stimulates proliferation (3Meininger C.J. Granger H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H198-H206PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ethier M.F. Chander V. Dobson J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H131-H138PubMed Google Scholar), an observation that is consistent with a possible role of adenosine in angiogenesis (5Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human endothelial cells derived from the umbilical vein, the mitogenic effect is mediated by the A2A-adenosine receptor (6Sexl V. Mancusi G. Baumgartner-Parzer S. Schütz W. Freissmuth M. Br. J Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); however, the available evidence indicates that growth stimulation is not mediated by cAMP, because forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, and membrane-permeable cAMP analogs such as 8-Br-cAMP1 inhibit endothelial cell growth (6Sexl V. Mancusi G. Baumgartner-Parzer S. Schütz W. Freissmuth M. Br. J Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1577-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7Leitman D.C. Fiscus R.R. Murad F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, the endothelial A2A-adenosine receptor stimulates phosphorylation of the MAP kinase isoforms erk1 and erk2 (8Sexl V. Mancusi G. Höller C. Gloria-Maercker E. Schütz W. Freissmuth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5792-5799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and of p70S6 kinase (9Höller C. Milligan G. Anderson N. Freissmuth M. Drug Dev. Res. 1998; 45: 145-150Crossref Google Scholar), effects that cannot be mimicked by 8-Br-cAMP. It has long been appreciated that elevated levels of cAMP inhibit the proliferation of many cells (10Pastan I.H. Johnson G.S. Anderson W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 491-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). This effect is thought to arise, at least in part, from inhibition of the interaction of p21ras with the downstream kinase raf-1, an effect that leads to cAMP-mediated suppression of the MAP kinase pathway (11Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfmann A. Weber M.J Sturgill T.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1066-1069Crossref Scopus (824) Google Scholar, 12Cook S.J. McCormick F.

A. 1993; 90: 10300-10304Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, in some cells activation of PKA does lead to activation of MAP kinase, the best studied example being PC12 cells; in this pheochromocytoma cell line, the stimulation of MAP kinase by cell-permeable analogs of cAMP has been linked to activation of B-raf via rap1, another member of the ras-like family of small monomeric GTP-binding proteins (15Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). These findings predict that receptor-induced adenylyl cyclase activation ought to activate MAP kinase in a manner dependent on rap1 but independent of p21ras. This prediction has been verified in S49 mouse lymphoma cells where the β2-adrenergic receptor requires Gs and rap1, but not p21ras, to signal to MAP kinase (16Wan Y. Huang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14533-14537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, in HEK293 cells, the β2-adrenergic receptor has recently been shown to activate MAP kinase via a complex pathway that involves PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor; this modification causes the G protein specificity of the receptor to switch from Gs to Gi; the resulting activation of Gi, in turn, generates enough free G protein βγ-dimers to support the stimulation of MAP kinase via tyrosine kinase-dependent activation of p21ras (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). It is not clear if this model of signal transduction is generally applicable to all Gs-coupled receptors. In the present work, we have investigated the mechanism by which the A2A-adenosine receptor, a typical Gs-coupled receptor, regulates MAP kinase after heterologous expression in two cell lines, i.e. HEK293 and CHO. In both cell lines, cAMP was generated and MAP kinase was activated in response to agonist stimulation. However, MAP kinase activation was achieved via distinct signaling pathways in the two cell lines. In CHO-A2A cells, MAP kinase activation involved Gαs, cAMP, PKA, rap1, and B-raf; in contrast, in HEK-A2A cells, MAP kinase activation was independent of Gs and cAMP and required p21ras.

The immunoreactive bands on nitrocellulose blots were detected by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate from Pierce. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Media for the culture of stably transfected cells were supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Geneticin (G418) in order to maintain the selection pressure. For transient transfections, HEK-A2Acells were plated at a density of 8 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and transiently transfected with 5–10 μg of the desired cDNAs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. CHO-A2A cells were plated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/10-cm dish transfected using the polycationic SuperFect® reagent. Co-transfection of pEGFP-C1, a vector carrying a red-shifted variant of wild-type green fluorescent protein cDNA from the jellyfish Aequoria victoria, served as a control to monitor transfection efficiency by fluorescence microscopy. When required in cotransfections with several plasmids, the appropriate empty vectors were added to keep the amount of DNA/dish constant. The medium was changed to remove excess DNA precipitates 3–18 h after transfection. Serum starvation and incubation with adenosine deaminase was initiated on day 1 or 2 after transfection, prior to the MAP kinase assay; at this time point, transfected (and control) CHO-A2A cells were also replated; cells from one transfection on a 10-cm dish were divided onto four 6-cm dishes. The subsequent starvation under serum-free conditions lasted for 24 and 48 h for HEK- and CHO-A2A, respectively; thereafter, MAP kinase stimulation was done as outlined below. Primary cultures of human endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical veins and propagated as described previously (7Leitman D.C. Fiscus R.R. Murad F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence on 60-mm dishes, and rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 24–48 h prior to MAP kinase assays in order to minimize basal activity. The starving medium was supplemented with 1 IU/ml adenosine deaminase to remove any endogenously produced adenosine. Pretreatment of cells with cholera toxin was also done for 48 h in starving medium containing adenosine deaminase. If not otherwise indicated, cells were subsequently stimulated by addition of medium containing or lacking agonists at 22 °C for 5 min. Control incubations were carried out in order to verify that the carry-over of dimethyl sulfoxide, which resulted in final concentrations of ≤0.1%, neither affected the basal levels of MAP kinase phosphorylation nor the response to agonists. The exposure to agonists or vehicle was terminated by rapidly rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; thereafter, the dish was immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen. After rapid thawing, cells were lysed by addition of 80 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 250 units/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/μl leupeptin). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the total protein content was measured photometrically using bicinchoninic acid (Micro-BCA kit, Pierce). Aliquots corresponding to 2.5–5 × 104 cells (10–30 μg of protein) were dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer containing 30 mm dithiothreitol and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels (monomer concentration 10–15% acrylamide, 0.26–0.4% bisacrylamide). MAP kinase activation was assayed by incubating nitrocellulose blots with an antiserum that recognizes only the phosphorylated forms of p42 and p44 MAP kinase; in order to rule out that the differences observed were due to the application of unequal amounts of lysates, control blots were also probed with an antiserum recognizing both the unphosphorylated (inactive) and phosphorylated (active form). The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Immunodetection of the other proteins was performed in an analogous manner, using the appropriate antibodies or antisera. GST fusion protein of the minimal ras-binding domain of raf1 (19de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) as well as of the rap1-binding domain of ralGDS (ral-RBD, Ref. 20Franke B. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) were expressed in Escherichia coli (strain BL21DE3); following induction by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacterial lysates were prepared as described. GST fusion proteins were immobilized by incubating bacterial lysates for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose (GSH-Sepharose) preequilibrated in pull-down buffer (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Sepharose beads were washed three times in order to remove excess GST fusion protein. Cells were prepared for the assay in a manner similar to that outlined above for MAP kinase assays (serum starvation and incubation with adenosine deaminase for 24–48 h,); if not otherwise stated, incubation with agonists was carried out for 5 min, followed by rapidly rinsing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and addition of pull-down buffer to achieve cell lysis. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min). The resulting supernatants were incubated together with the GSH-Sepharose beads (50 μl of a 1:1 slurry containing about 10 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein) for 1 h to allow for the association of activated p21ras or rap1 with the effector-GST fusion protein. Samples were washed three times in modified radioimmune precipitation buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels; p21ras or rap1 were visualized using specific antibodies in a dilution of 1:500. Cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates. [3H]Adenine (0.1 mCi/ml) was added 18 h prior to stimulation of the cells and was maintained throughout the subsequent incubation at the same concentration. Rolipram (100 μm) and adenosine deaminase (1 unit/ml) were added 60 min before termination of the assay; agonists were added for the last 30 min. Cholera toxin (0.03–1 μg/ml) was added for the time periods indicated in the figure legends. Assays were performed in triplicate. The formation of [3H]cAMP was quantified according to Salomon (21Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Each experiment reported was carried out at least three times. Incubation of stably transfected HEK-A2A and CHO-A2A cells with the A2A-selective agonist CGS21680 resulted in a substantial accumulation of cAMP (Fig.1 A,); this effect was not observed in untransfected control cells (shown for CHO in Fig.1 A). The potency of CGS21680 in inducing formation of [3H]cAMP was comparable in both cell lines (EC50 = 32 ± 6 nm; Fig. 1 A). Maximum levels of [3H]cAMP accumulation were about 2-fold higher in HEK-A2A than in CHO-A2A. In both, CHO-A2A and HEK-A2A cells (Fig. 1, B and C), CGS 21680 stimulated MAP kinase activity over a concentration range that was reasonably similar to that required for adenylyl cyclase activation and that was comparable to that required for MAP kinase activation in primary human endothelial cells (Fig.1 B, ▴). Activation of MAP kinase was mediated by the A2A-adenosine receptor, because (i) the A1-selective agonist CPA was substantially (100–1000-fold) less potent (shown for CHO-A2A in Fig. 1, B and C, left panel) and (ii) the adenosine receptor antagonist XAC prevented the activation of MAP kinase over a wide concentration range of CGS21680 (shown for CHO-A2A in Fig.1 D); (iii) finally, MAP kinase stimulation by CGS21680 was not observed in untransfected control cells (data not shown). In the presence of PD098059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase 1 (Mek1; see Ref. 22Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), the stimulation of MAP kinase by CGS21680 was suppressed (shown for HEK-A2A in Fig. 1 C, right panel); hence, Mek1 is an upstream regulator of MAP kinase in the signaling cascade that links the A2A-adenosine receptor to MAP kinase. Cholera toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of Gαs impairs the ability of the protein to cleave GTP. This leads to irreversible activation of Gαs, resulting in a pronounced stimulation of downstream effectors; in most cells, the effect is reversed due to down-regulation of Gαs after long term toxin treatment (23Milligan G. Unson C.G. Wakelam M.J. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We exposed CHO-A2A and HEK-A2A cells to cholera toxin for time spans varying from 10 min to 48 h and measured the generation of [3H]cAMP (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, a different time course was observed in the two cell lines. In HEK-A2A cells (Fig. 2 A, right panel), accumulation of cAMP rose rapidly; the peak was reached after 3 h of exposure to cholera toxin and was followed by a decrease of cAMP accumulation such that at 12 h after addition of cholera toxin cAMP had returned to basal levels; these remained unchanged over the next 36 h. Immunoblots with a Gαs-specific antiserum confirmed that the levels of Gαs were greatly reduced (data not shown). In contrast, in CHO-A2A cells, the initial peak of cAMP production at 3 h was rather small; unlike HEK-A2A cells, cAMP levels increased subsequently and a pronounced elevation that lasted from 24 to 48 h was observed (Fig. 2 A, left panel). A down-regulation of Gαs was also not detected in CHO-A2A cells by immunoblots, even if cells were exposed for 48 h to cholera toxin concentrations up to 1 μg/ml (data not shown). Accordingly, agonist-induced generation of cAMP after 48 h of pretreatment with cholera toxin remained unaffected in CHO-A2A (cf. filled bars in the left panel of Fig.2 B), but was virtually abolished in HEK-A2Acells (Fig. 2 B, right panel). We are currently unable to explain the resistance of Gαs in CHO-A2A cells to down-regulation by cholera toxin. More importantly, the loss of Gαs and of the receptor-mediated cAMP increase in HEKA2A was exploited to determine, if MAP kinase stimulation by the A2A receptor required Gαs. As can be seen in the right panel of Fig. 2 C, the response of MAP kinase to the A2A agonist was readily detectable in HEK-A2A cells that had been preincubated for 48 h with cholera toxin. This suggests that in HEK cells the A2A-adenosine may recruit other signaling mechanisms in addition to or in the place of Gs that trigger the MAP kinase cascade. In contrast, after pretreatment with cholera toxin, the basal level of MAP kinase phosphorylation was substantially increased in CHO-A2A cells and CGS21680 failed to induce any further stimulation of MAP kinase (Fig. 2 C, left panel). Activation of PKC by the phorbol ester β-PDBu still augmented MAP kinase phosphorylation in cholera toxin-treated CHO-A2A cells (Fig. 2 C, left panel); hence, we rule out that the absence of an A2A agonist effect reflects a general unresponsiveness of the cells. It is more likely that the high basal level of MAP kinase phosphorylation is caused by the persistent elevation of cAMP levels, which occlude any further stimulation of MAP kinase by CGS21680 on MAP kinase (see below). In HEK293 cells, the β2-adrenergic receptor switches its G protein coupling specificity from Gs to Giupon PKA-dependent phosphorylation; this allows for pertussis toxin-sensitive activation of MAP kinase in response to β-adrenergic agonists (17Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1997; 390: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). We have therefore tested whether the A2A-adenosine receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation was dependent on pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. However, ADP-ribosylation of Gαi by pertussis toxin pretreatment of CHO-A2A (Fig.3 A, middle panel) and of HEK-A2A cells (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel) had no effect on MAP kinase phosphorylation following agonist exposure. In experiments carried out in parallel under identical conditions, the incubation of stably tranfected cells with pertussis toxin completely suppressed signaling by prototypical Gi-coupled receptors such as the A1-adenosine and D2-dopamine receptors and more than 99% of the Gαi subunits were found to be ADP-ribosylated (data not shown; see also Ref. 24Waldhoer M. Bofill-Cardona E. Milligan G. Freissmuth M. Nanoff C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 808-818PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-A2Acells were also incubated with the combination of cholera toxin (300 ng/ml, 48 h) and pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml, 24 h). This harsh treatment caused many cells to detach from the plastic support; nevertheless, in the remaining adherent cells MAP kinase stimulation was still seen upon CGS21680 stimulation (data not shown). Finally, PKC isoforms can be activated by Gi-coupled receptors via release of βγ-dimers, which lead to activation phospholipase Cβ2 and related isoforms (25Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar) as opposed to stimulation of inositol trisphosphate by Gαq/Gα11; hence, we have also incubated HEK-A2A cells with GF109203X, an inhibitor of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms. Although the β-PDBu-dependent phosphorylation of MAP kinase was abolished by 1 μm GF109203X, the stimulation by CGS21680 remained unaffected (Fig. 3 B). We therefore rule out that any Gi-dependent pathway is involved in the MAP kinase response following stimulation of the A2A-adenosine receptor in HEK293 cells. As mentioned above, pretreatment of CHO-A2A cells with cholera toxin substantially increased the phosphorylation of MAP kinase in the absence of any agonist. If this effect were related to cAMP-dependent activation of PKA (as opposed to a result of βγ-dimers released from persistently activated Gαs), a membrane-permeable cAMP analogue ought to mimic the effect of cholera toxin. This was the case. Addition of 8-Br-cAMP to CHO-A2Acells resulted in MAP kinase activation (Fig. 3 A); the stimulation of MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by both CGS21680 and 8-Br-cAMP was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor H89. In contrast, addition of 8-Br-cAMP to HEK-A2A did not per se stimulate MAP kinase up to concentrations of 0.5 mm (Fig. 3, A and B), although activation by a low concentration of CGS21680 was readily detectable (Fig. 3 B). The absence of any stimulatory effect is not due to the inability of 8-Br-cAMP to permeate into HEK-A2Acells, because the nucleotide blunted the effect of bFGF (Fig.3 B). Finally, direct stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by 10 μm forskolin resulted in MAP kinase phosphorylation only in CHO-A2A but not in HEK-A2A cells (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in CHO-A2A cells, MAP kinase activation by the A2Areceptor can be accounted for by the generation of cAMP; in contrast, in HEK-A2A cells, this signaling pathway is dispensable. The small monomeric GTPase p21ras plays a crucial role as an upstream regulator of MAP kinase. In ras-dependent MAP kinase cascades, cAMP exerts an inhibitory effect by suppressing the activation of raf-1 (11Wu J. Dent P. Jelinek T. Wolfmann A. Weber M.J Sturgill T.W.

The atherogenicity of small, dense LDL is believed to be one of the main reasons for this association. This particle contains less phospholipids (PL) and unesterified cholesterol than large LDL, and the apoB-100 appears to occupy a more extensive area at its surface. Although there are experiments that suggest a metabolic pathway leading to the overproduction of small, dense LDL, no clear molecular model exists to explain its association with atherogenesis. A current hypothesis is that small, dense LDL, because of its higher affinity for proteoglycans, is entrapped in the intima extracellular matrix and is more susceptible to oxidative modifications than large LDL. Here we describe how a specific reduction of approximately 50% of the PL of a normal buoyant LDL by immobilized phospholipase A2(PLA2) (EC 3.1.1.4) produces smaller and denser particles without inducing significant lipoprotein aggregation (<5%). These smaller LDL particles display a higher tendency to form nonsoluble complexes with proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans than the parent LDL. Binding parameters of LDL and glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans produced by human arterial smooth muscle cells were measured at near to physiological conditions. The PLA2-modified LDL has about 2 times higher affinity for the sulfated polysaccharides than control LDL. In addition, incubation of human plasma in the presence of PLA2 generated smaller LDL and HDL particles compared with the control plasma incubated without PLA2. These in vitro results indicate that the reduction of surface PL characteristic of small, dense LDL subfractions, besides contributing to its small size and density, may enhance its tendency to be retained by proteoglycans.

This operationally defined density range can contain subclasses of particles of different size and density caused by dissimilar contents of core and surface lipids (1Capell W. Zambon A. Austin M.

Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Much interest is focused on the metabolic and genetic factors leading to the presence of LDL profiles in which the majority of particles centers around small, dense particles (LDL-III) with diameters of 25.5 to 24.2 nm and densities between 1.040 and 1.060 g/ml, the phenotype B. Subjects with such phenotype have significantly higher susceptibility to CHD, when compared with subjects that have most of their LDL as large particles (LDL-I and LDL-II) with diameters between 25.5 and 27.5 nm and densities between 1.025 and 1.040 g/ml, the phenotype A (3Krauss R.M. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1997; 80: 22-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 4Betteridge D.J. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: 149-151Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Chapman M.J. Guérin M. Bruckert E. Eur. Heart J. 1998; 19 Suppl. A: A24-A30PubMed Google Scholar). Excess LDL-III is a marker of insulin resistance and type II diabetes, and it occurs almost always in combination with moderate hypertriglyceridemia, above 2 mmor 180 mg/dl, and low levels of HDL (6Austin M. Mykkänen L. Kuusisto J. Edwards K. Nelson C. Haffner S. Pyörälä K. Laakso M. Circulation. 1995; 92: 1770-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 7Abate N. Vega G.L. Garg A. Grundy S.M. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 118: 111-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because its association with CHD, this lipoprotein pattern has been also termed the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP) (8Sattar N. Petrie J. Jaap A. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 138: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The susceptibility to develop the ALP appears associated with genes in chromosomes 19, 11, and 16, and heredity controls about 50% of its expression. The rest of the expression is dependent on hormonal and life style factors (3Krauss R.M. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1997; 80: 22-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The metabolic reasons for the appearance of an excess of LDL-III are under intense exploration, and several steps in the lipolytic conversion of VLDL and intermediate density lipoproteins have been postulated to be responsible for its production in conjugality with the action of cholesterol ester transport protein. One hypothesis, supported on metabolic studies, proposes that overproduction of large TG-rich VLDL causes an increase in the exchange of TG for cholesterol esters (CE) between this particle and LDL leading to a momentary increase of TG in LDL. The resulting TG-rich LDL become a good substrate for the action of hepatic lipoprotein lipase, which also has a phospholipase activity, and possibly for the endothelial lipoprotein lipase. This produces a small dense particle with a reduced content of core CE and of the surface components PL and UC (9Hokanson J. Krauss R.M. Albers J. Austin M. Brunzell J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, when subfractions of LDL with increasing density are isolated from normal subjects a similar trend in decreased content of surface UC and PL and core CE per apoB-100 particle is observed (2McNamara J. Small D. Li Z. Schaefer E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hokanson J. Krauss R.M. Albers J. Austin M. Brunzell J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore the phenotype B can be considered the result of exaggerated accumulation in plasma of small, dense particles that may exist at lower concentration in normal men and women with the A phenotype. Two, nonexclusive, hypotheses have been considered to be responsible for the increased atherogenicity of small, dense LDL and its association with cardiovascular disease. One is its preferential entry and retention in the arterial wall, especially at sites of lesion development. This is supported by in vitro experiments (10Nordestgaard B. Wooton R. Lewis B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 11Björnheden T. Babyi A. Bondjers G. Wiklund O. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 123: 43-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The other, also based on in vitro results, suggests that small, dense LDL is more susceptible to oxidative and hydrolytic modification than buoyant, large LDL once entrapped in the arterial intima at sites of lesion progression (12Tribble D. van den Berg J.M. Motchnik P.A. Ames B.N. Lewis D.M. Chait A. Krauss R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Tribble D. Krauss R.M. Langsberg M. Thiel P.M. van den Berg J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 662-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reasons why small, dense LDL are better retained in lesions than buoyant LDL are not clear. However, our laboratory showed ex vivo that smaller subfractions of human LDL bind with higher affinity to human arterial chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG). The smallest LDL showed a significantly lower content in surface PL and UC than large LDL. Owing to the lower content in the surface lipids, the apoB-100 was estimated to have up to 45% larger area to cover at the particle surface compared with the largest LDL subfraction. We suggested that this could expose more of the PG-binding segments of the apoB-100 (14Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, human macrophages internalized and degraded significantly more of the small, dense LDL with high affinity for CSPG than the larger low affinity subfractions (14Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Wiklund O. Bondjers G. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Anber et al. (15Anber V. Griffin B. McConnell M. Packard C. Sheperd J. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 124: 261-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Anber V. Millar J. McConnell M. Sheperd J. Packard C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2507-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) found that subjects with the ALP and with high levels of LDL-III also show a higher affinity for human arterial CSPG. These results suggest that the entrapment of LDL-III by CSPG in the intima may contribute to its atherogenicity. As mentioned, the smaller size of centrifugally separated small, dense LDL or that of the small, dense LDL separated by its affinity for CSPG results mainly in a lower content of PL and UC at the surface monolayer (2McNamara J. Small D. Li Z. Schaefer E. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hokanson J. Krauss R.M. Albers J. Austin M. Brunzell J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1387-1398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the apparent causality of a reduction in surface PL or UC on the increased affinity for PG and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) remains to be established. To explore these potential relationships, we studied the effect on size, density, and affinity for GAG and PG of an in vitro reduction of surface PL of LDL by immobilized PLA2. PLA2-agarose, decorin, biglycan, deuterium oxide, HEPES, free fatty acid-free BSA, cetyl pyridinium chloride, Oil Red O, Fat Red 7B, and toluidine blue O were purchased from Sigma. C6S and dermatan sulfate was bought from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan). NEFA-C kit was from Wako Chemicals GmbH (Neuss, Germany). NuSieve agarose 3:1 and GelBond films were from FMC Bioproducts (Rockland, ME). Salts and other buffer substances or detergents were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All the water used was filtered through a MilliPore® Milli-Q system and was of high purity (resistivity >18 megohm cm−1). LDL was isolated from healthy male donors by sequential centrifugation as described (17Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). LDL containing 10 μm butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 mg/ml nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA)-free BSA (750 μm) was added to sequester the NEFA liberated by PLA2. Reaction mixtures (1 ml) containing 1 mg of LDL (apoB-100 protein) (2 μm) and 0.1 unit of PLA2-agarose were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time points. The reaction was stopped by removing the PLA2-agarose by a brief centrifugation at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant was collected. The activity of PLA2 was monitored by measuring the release of NEFA using a commercial kit (NEFA-C, Wako Chemicals). Charge alterations of LDL were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. A 0.7% agarose gel was prepared with running buffer (0.05 m barbital buffer, pH 8.5). Ten μl of the PLA2-LDL (1 mg/ml) and control LDL (incubated without PLA2) was loaded on the gel, and electrophoresis was run for 3 h at 60 V with buffer recirculation and cooling. The gel was fixed in 60% ethanol for 2 h, and after air-drying the lipids were stained with 0.015% Oil Red O and 0.06% Fat Red 7B in the fix solution. The effects of PLA2 on LDL density were analyzed by density gradient centrifugation. Continuous density gradients (1.006–1.116 g/ml) were prepared using D2O as described (18Hallberg C. Hådén M. Bergström M. Hanson G. Petterson K. Westerlund C. Bondjers G. Österlund-Lundqvist A.-M. Camejo G. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lipoproteins were placed at the bottom of each gradient. After centrifugation at 20 °C for 46 h at 35,000 rpm (SW 40 rotor, XL-90 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman), 0.5-ml fractions were collected by bottom displacement with the use of a fraction recovery system (270–331580, Beckman). The cholesterol content in the collected fractions was monitored by the CHOD-PAP method (19Siedel J. Hagele E.O. Ziegenhorn J. Wahlefeld A.W. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar) with reagents bought from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (absorbance determined at 500 nm). The LDL particle size of the peak fractions after D2O gradient centrifugation was measured by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 2–16% gradient gels as described (20Krauss R.M. Burke D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 97-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol and phospholipid distribution profiles were measured with a size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography system, SMART, with a Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromatographic system was linked to an air-segmented continuous flow system for on-line post-derivatization analysis of total cholesterol and phospholipids using enzymatic colorimetric reagents. The SMART system was connected to a sample injector (Gina 50, Gynkotek HPLC, Germering, GmbH). Elution buffer consisted of 0.01 m Tris, 0.03 m NaCl, pH 7.40, and the flow rate was 35 μl/min. The on-line flow system was equipped with a peristaltic pump, flow rate 0.7 ml/min, and a coil for 8 min of incubation at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at 500 nm with a UV-visible detector (Jasco UV-970, Jasco International Co, LTD, Japan). Data were integrated with a Chromeleon chromatography data system (Gynkotek HPLC, Germering, GmbH). The distribution of lipoproteins was continuously measured as cholesterol or phospholipids by using the enzymatic reagents reconstituted in buffer at double the amount suggested by the manufacturer. Cholesterol was measured with a kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (cholesterol MPRI 1442341) and phospholipids with a kit from Wako Chemicals (phospholipids B 990–54009 E). Each run lasted 60 min, and the sample size used was 10 μl. The integrated area is expressed in molar concentrations. LDL were re-isolated, after incubation with or without PLA2, by D2O ultracentrifugation as described below. All lipid classes in LDL were analyzed with a modification of the high performance liquid chromatography developed by Homan and Anderson (21Homan R. Anderson M.K. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1998; 708: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The column was an Alltech, Allsphere Si, 5 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm. In the first solvent n-heptane was used instead of tetrahydrofuran. The detector was an evaporative light scattering 500 from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). The external standards used were prepared by Larodan Fine Chemicals (Malmö, Sweden). The high performance liquid chromatography system was from Gynkotek GmbH, equipped with a Chromaleon software (Munich, Germany). Analysis of interactions between PLA2-LDL and GAG at low ionic strength was done essentially as described (16Anber V. Millar J. McConnell M. Sheperd J. Packard C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2507-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Camejo G. Linden T. Olsson U. Wiklund O. Lopez F. Bondjers G. Atherosclerosis. 1989; 79: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, LDL (1 mg/ml) modified by PLA2 for the indicated time points was diluted to 0.1 mg of apoB/ml with buffer 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmCaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2. This gives a final NaCl concentration of 14 mm. Four μg of GAG was added to 100 μl of LDL, and the samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were removed and the pellets dissolved in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl. The cholesterol in the pellets was measured according to the CHOD-PAP method with reagents bought from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. In experiments with proteoglycans (decorin and biglycan), the LDL was diluted with buffer 10 mm HEPES, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. This gives a higher final NaCl concentration (32 mm); otherwise the same protocol was used as for the GAG. Analysis of interactions between PLA2-LDL and C6S at physiological salt concentrations was done with the following modification of a described procedure (23Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Sartipy P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 110: 267-279PubMed Google Scholar). First, the PLA2-LDL and native LDL were reisolated by ultracentrifugation using a 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, prepared with D2O with a final density of 1.082 g/ml. After centrifugation at 20 °C for 3 h at 260,000 × g (rotor TLA 120.2, Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge, Beckman), the top fraction containing LDL was collected by aspiration. A constant amount of C6S (0.5 μg) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations of LDL in a final volume of 20 μl of 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mmNaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2. Two μl of glycerol was added, and the samples were loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel (NuSieve 3:1) prepared with running buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 2 mmCaCl2, and 4 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2. Electrophoresis was run for 1 h at 60 V with buffer recirculation and cooling. The gel was fixed in 0.1% cetyl pyridinium chloride in 70% ethanol for 2 h. After air drying, the gel was stained with 0.1% toluidine blue O in HAc:ethanol:H2O (0.1:5:5) for 30 min and destained in the same solution without toluidine blue O for 30 min. The gel was scanned using a DuoScan (Agfa, Mortsel, Belgium) and the intensity of the bands representing the free C6S was quantified using a KS 400 version 2.0 image analyzing system (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The intensity was linearly proportional to the amount of GAG in the range 0–0.5 μg of C6S (r 2 = 0.99). Binding parameters were also measured with the gel mobility shift assay using radiolabeled proteoglycans synthesized by human arterial smooth muscle cells. 35S- and 3H-labeled proteoglycans were isolated by ion exchange chromatography from conditioned medium of human arterial smooth muscle cell as described (25Sartipy P. Johansen B. Camejo G. Rosengren B. Bondjers G. Hurt-Camejo E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26307-26314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This preparation of total proteoglycans contains mainly chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Each reaction contained a constant amount of labeled proteoglycans (measured as counts/min) and increasing concentrations of LDL in the same way as described above. However, the final NaCl concentration in each reaction was slightly lower (105 mmNaCl) than stated above for C6S. The quantification of the dried gels was done by digital autoradiography using a DAR signal analyzing system (Berthold Laboratories, Wilband, Germany). Plasma was collected from 9 healthy volunteers (5 female and 4 male) after overnight fasting. The plasma was diluted 1:4 with phosphate-buffered saline, and BHT was added to a final concentration of 10 μm. For each donor 1 ml of diluted plasma was incubated with or without (control) 0.5 units of PLA2-agarose at 37 °C for 20 h. The reaction was stopped by removing the PLA2-agarose by a brief centrifugation at 10,000 ×g, and the supernatant was collected. The generation of NEFA was measuring using a commercial kit (NEFA-C, Wako Chemicals). Aliquots (0.7 ml) from the control plasmas and the PLA2-modified plasmas were taken, and the following parameters were determined by proton NMR spectroscopy (LipoMed Inc. Raleigh, NC) as described (26Otvos J.D. Jeyarajah E.J. Bennett D.W. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar,27Otvos J.D. Jeyarajah E.J. Bennett D.W. Krauss R.K. Clin. Chem. 1992; 38: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar): lipoprotein subclass distribution, average lipoprotein sizes, total TG, total cholesterol, VLDL TG, LDL cholesterol, LDL particle concentration, and HDL cholesterol. Mean and standard deviation of measurements, nonlinear regression of binding parameters, and Student's t tests for determinations of statistical significance were evaluated with the computer software GraphPad PrismTM version 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego, CA). Incubation of LDL with PLA2 at physiological conditions results in hydrolysis of LDL phospholipids. The PLA2-derived NEFA were quantified as a function of the incubation time, and the results are shown in Fig.1. Incubation of LDL without PLA2-agarose did not generate any detectable amounts of NEFA under the conditions used in this study. The electrophoretic mobility of the PLA2-LDL was compared with LDL incubated in parallel without PLA2. As shown in Fig.2 the mobility of the PLA2-LDL was slightly modified and the lipoprotein migrated as a more diffuse band. Although the amount of BSA used should sequester most of the NEFA produced, we attributed this mobility change to some residual NEFA that remained LDL-bound. No difference in mobility was detected between native LDL (kept at 4 °C) and LDL incubated without PLA2. Isoelectric focusing did not show any significant change in the isoelectric point comparing native LDL and LDL incubated with PLA2 for 3 and 14 h (data not shown). To rule out the possibility of oxidation of the lipoproteins, the content of conjugated dienes was analyzed at 234 nm in the PLA2-LDL and compared with native LDL. No increase in the content of conjugated dienes was found in the PLA2-LDL (data not shown). This is, however, expected since the LDL solutions always contained 10 μm BHT.Figure 2Agarose gel electrophoresis of PLA2-LDL. Ten μl of PLA2-LDL (1 mg/ml) and control LDL (incubated without PLA2) was loaded on a 0.7% agarose gel prepared with running buffer (0.05 mbarbital buffer, pH 8.5). After electrophoresis, the gel was fixed and stained as described under “Experimental Procedure.” The incubation time with (+) or without (−) PLA2 is indicated in the figure. Native LDL (kept at +4 °C) is abbreviated Nat. The LDL migrated from the cathode (bottom) to the top (anode), and the positions of the slots are indicated by + and −.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the effect of PLA2 hydrolysis of LDL-PL on its density, the lipoproteins were fractionated using density gradient centrifugation in D2O. The cholesterol content in the collected fractions was determined, and representative gradient profiles are shown in Fig. 3. In the experiment presented in Fig. 3 the peak density of LDL increased from 1.036 to 1.041 g/ml after 3 h PLA2 modification and to 1.046 g/ml after 14 h. There was no indication of aggregation based on turbidity measurements at 430 nm in any of the collected fractions (data not shown). The denser, PLA2-modified LDL were also of smaller size than native LDL. In the nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Fig.4, the size of the lipoprotein particles decreased from 27.0 to 26.6 nm and to 26.5 nm after incubation with PLA2 for 3 and 14 h, respectively. No aggregated lipoproteins were observed in the gel. The 17 nm band in each lane represents thyroglobulin that was used as internal standard and added together with the sample buffer prior to loading the gel.Figure 4Determination of LDL particle size. The LDL article size of the peak fractions after D2O gradient centrifugation was measured by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 2–16% gradient gels. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the particle size was determined using molecular weight standards (Std). Native LDL, lane 1; PLA2-LDL 3 h, lane 2; and PLA2-LDL 14 h, lane 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The degree of possible LDL aggregation due to PLA2lipolysis was further analyzed using size exclusion chromatography. Control LDL and LDL incubated with PLA2 for 14 h were applied to a Superose 6 column, and the elution profiles were measured as cholesterol, and phospholipid content was continuously recorded. Representative elution profiles are shown in Fig.5. To indicate the resolution of the SMART system, human plasma profiles are also included in the figures. In the PLA2-LDL there was only a slight tendency of LDL aggregation, and after repeated injections using different PLA2-LDL preparations it could be concluded that the degree of aggregation was consistently low (<5%). The phospholipid profiles (Fig. 5 B) show a reduction of about 50% in the phospholipid content in the LDL incubated with PLA2 for 14 h compared with the control. On the other hand, there is an increase in the content of choline in the albumin fraction supporting a role of albumin as a lysophosphatidylcholine transporter. A lipid analysis of LDL before and after incubation with or without PLA2 for 14 h showed that the action of PLA2 is highly specific and almost only degrades the PC component present in the LDL (Fig. 6). The lipoproteins used for the analysis were reisolated from the reaction buffer by D2O ultracentrifugation. After incubation of LDL for 14 h with PLA2 about 50% of the PC was degraded. The lipid content in native LDL and LDL incubated for 14 h at 37 °C without PLA2 (Fig. 6, Ctrl-LDL) was similar. The hydrolysis of LDL-PL by PLA2 caused an increase in the affinity of the lipoprotein for GAG and PG when measured by LDL precipitation at low ionic strength or by gel mobility shift assay at near to physiological ionic conditions. Fig.7 shows the increase of complex formation of the PLA2-LDL with C6S in correlation to the degree of PL hydrolysis. Incubation of native LDL with C6S under these conditions led only to formation of small amounts of nonsoluble complexes. Experiments using dermatan sulfate gave similar results (data not shown). PLA2-modified LDL incubated with the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan also formed more nonsoluble complexes than native LDL (Fig. 8). More nonsoluble complexes were formed with biglycan than with decorin probably due to the higher content of GAG in biglycan compared with decorin (two and one CS/DS chain, respectively). Gel mobility shift assay was used to study the interactions of PLA2-LDL and C6S at conditions in which reversible complexes are formed. PLA2-modified lipoproteins were incubated with C6S, and the complexes formed were separated from the free GAG by agarose gel electrophoresis. Similar experiments were carried out with metabolically labeled extracellular matrix PG secreted by human arterial smooth mus"

Here, we investigated the properties of mammalian CDC6 protein, a candidate regulator of MCM. The levels of CDC6 were relatively constant during the HeLa cell cycle. In asynchronous cells, CDC6 was mainly detected in the nuclei with immunostaining, but some CDC6 was not extractable with nonionic detergent. In contrast to the chromatin-bound MCM, this fraction of CDC6 was resistant to DNase I treatment, suggesting that it binds to the detergent- and nuclease-resistant nuclear structure. In S phase cells, CDC6 became detectable in the cytoplasm with immunostaining; however, the level of the bound CDC6 was unchanged. In G2/M phase cells, the level of the bound CDC6 was still maintained, which was hyperphosphorylated by CDC2 kinase. These data suggest that some CDC6 protein is associated with the specific nuclear structure throughout the cell cycle and that major binding sites on chromatin differ between MCM and CDC6. However, co-immunoprecipitation assays with chemical cross-linking indicated that a small part of the chromatin-bound MCM is present close to the bound CDC6.

It seems likely that yeast prereplication complex-like complexes are organized on prereplication chromatin.

There are several possible mechanisms for the CDK-directed inhibition. One is the phosphorylation of CDC6 by the CDK, e.g. in fission yeast, phosphorylation of Cdc18, a homologue of CDC6, by the CDK leads to its rapid degradation, and overexpression of its stable form or CDK phosphorylation site-mutant form drives cells into rereplication (21Jallepalli P.V.

It is assumed that they also play regulatory roles in mammalian cell DNA replication, as in the yeast and Xenopus egg systems, although specific differences should also exist. Previously, we found that the six human MCMs (hMCMs) are present as heterohexameric complexes throughout the cell cycle, whether bound to chromatin or not (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F.

Multiple protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture for Mammalian Cell Extracts, Sigma; 25 μl/ml), 200 μmNa3VO4, and 20 mm NaF were also added to the buffer. The cells were then subjected to centrifugation to obtain the extractable fractions. The extracted nuclei were either directly added to SDS sample buffer or digested with 1000 units/ml DNase I (10 units/μl, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing 1 mm ATP and the multiple protease inhibitors at 25 °C for 30 min (24Fujita M.

For immunoprecipitation, antibodies were cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads. HeLa cells cultured in 100-mm plates were lysed for 10 min on ice with 1 ml RIPA buffer (32Fujita M. Kiyono T.

Separate aliquots were diluted with NET gel buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, mixed with the beads, and rocked for 1 h. The beads were then washed with NET gel buffer, and the immunoprecipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were collected, added to β-mercaptoethanol, reboiled, and subjected to 10% (10:0.1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) SDS-PAGE. Cross-linked nuclear fraction was prepared as follows. Triton X-100-extracted nuclei prepared as above were washed once with cross-link buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0, 1 mmMgCl2, 100 mm sucrose, 0.01% Triton X-100) by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in the buffer. Dithiobis-succinimidylpropionate (DSP) was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the samples were rocked for 20 min at 4 °C. The reaction was quenched by Tris-glycine buffer, and then the nuclei were washed with cross-link buffer, added to RIPA buffer containing 1% SDS, diluted with NET gel buffer, and sonicated. The washing buffer for the immunoprecipitation was NET gel buffer containing 0.05% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Whole cell lysates were prepared by directly adding SDS sample buffer to cell pellets. In vitro translated hCDC6 and hORC1 proteins were obtained from their cDNAs with a coupled transcription-translation system (Promega). Multiple protease inhibitors were included in the reaction. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol.

Cells grown in culture chambers (Nunc) were fixed for 10 min with 3.7% formaldehyde and then permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C for 2 min. The samples were first incubated with phosphate-buffered saline with 10% normal goat serum and then with anti-hCDC6 antibodies (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h. After washing, the samples were reacted with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 0.01 μg/ml diamidophenylindole to stain DNA. Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were resuspended in phosphatase buffer (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.01% Triton X-100 and the multiple protease inhibitors and incubated with λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 400 μmNa3VO4. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mmNaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 μmcalyculin A, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with CDC2/cyclin B purified from FM3A cells (41Kusubata M.

With Western blotting, anti-hCDC6 antibodies could detect the bacterially produced hCDC6 at levels as low as 100 pg (data not shown). The antibodies recognized in vitro translated hCDC6 protein but not in vitro translated hORC1 protein (Fig.1 A). A protein migrating at approximately 62 kDa was detected in whole cell lysates from HeLa cells, the mobility of which on SDS-PAGE was concordant with that of the in vitro translated hCDC6 protein (Fig. 1 A). The antibodies also could immunoprecipitate the 62-kDa protein (Fig.1 B). Together, we concluded that the 62-kDa protein is hCDC6. We note that hCDC6 protein is unstable in vitro. We have used 0.1%TX-100mCSK buffer to fractionate cells (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the buffer supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, proteins such as hMCMs and proliferating cell nuclear antigen are relatively stable (34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, hCDC6 was readily degraded; even when held on ice, most was degraded after 10 min (data not shown). Therefore, to inhibit proteolysis as much as possible, we should add sufficient amounts of multiple protease inhibitors to the extraction buffer. To investigate whether the levels of hCDC6 protein change during the cell cycle, we prepared whole cell lysates from asynchronous (where 60–70% cells are in G1 phase), early S phase (hydroxyurea-treated), and G2/M phase (nocodazole-treated) HeLa cells and analyzed them by immunoblotting. A 2–3-fold increase was observed in the S phase cells, and the protein from G2/M cells resolved into a doublet on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). The levels of hMCM7 were unchanged among the lysates (Fig. 2), in agreement with our previous results (32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There is some discrepancy among two previous reports and our present findings. Williams et al. (35Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) reported nuclear hCDC6 protein levels to be constant during the HeLa cell cycle while fluctuating in WI38 cells, and Saha et al. (36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) experienced no remarkable change in either HeLa or NIH3T3 cell cycles. The reason for the difference is currently unknown. At least, our observed increase in the S phase hCDC6 protein levels is in line with the reported enhanced expression of its mRNA in S phase (35Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, compared with yeast case, in which CDC6/Cdc18 protein is rapidly degraded through the S phase-CDK phosphorylation (9Piatti S. Lengauer C. Nasmyth K. EMBO J. 1995; 1141: 3788-3799Crossref Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 21Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the cell cycle variation of CDC6 protein levels in mammalian cells appears to be limited, similar to Xenopus CDC6 in the Xenopus egg extract system (15Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear whether Xenopus CDC6 is phosphorylated by CDKs, our data suggest that hCDC6 may be phosphorylated by CDC2 kinase in the G2/M phase (see below). However, this does not appear to lead to dramatic reduction in hCDC6 protein levels. To investigate the subcellular localization of hCDC6 protein, immunofluorescence staining was applied to asynchronous HeLa cells. Approximately 60–70% of the cells showed dominant nuclear staining with some cytoplasmic positivity, whereas remaining interphase cells demonstrated rather strong cytoplasmic staining (data not shown). Taking into account the previous finding that exogenously transfected hCDC6 protein is present in nuclei in G1 but in cytoplasm in S phase cells (36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we investigated hCDC6 localization in synchronized HeLa cells. In the G1phase cells, dominant nuclear staining with some cytoplasmic staining was observed (Fig. 3, panel 1). However, in most of the early S phase cells, strong cytoplasmic staining was observed (Fig. 3, panel 5), which remained also in G2 phase cells (Fig. 3, panel 9, left two cells). In mitotic cells, homogeneous staining was obtained (Fig. 3, panel 9). Although the significance of the cytoplasmic staining in G1 cells is currently unclear, the changing pattern of major localization of endogenous hCDC6 protein during the cell cycle is in agreement with previous findings for transfected hCDC6 (36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We next investigated subcellular localization of hCDC6 protein with cell fractionation. First, cells were treated with 0.1%TX-100mCSK, which extracts not only cytoplasmic but also nuclear proteins not tightly bound to nuclear structures, and second, the extracted nuclei were digested with DNase I to remove the bulk of chromatin (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As we showed previously (32Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), in asynchronous HeLa cells, about two-thirds of the hMCM7 protein was extracted with the buffer, and most of the rest was released by DNase I digestion (Fig. 4 A). The DNase I treatment also liberated about two-thirds of core histones and DNA from the extracted nuclei (data not shown, but see our previous paper; Ref. 34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The same fractions were then examined with anti-hCDC6 antibodies. About two-thirds of the hCDC6 protein was detected in the extractable fraction, and the rest were detected in the extracted nuclei. However, in contrast to the chromatin-bound hMCMs, most of the nucleus-bound hCDC6 was resistant to DNase I treatment (Fig.4 A). Similar results were also obtained with the restriction enzyme Hae III and other human cell lines (data not shown). We could not obtain positive hCDC6 immunostaining in the extracted nuclei (data not shown). The bound form hCDC6 may be inaccessible to our antibodies. We next examined early S phase HeLa cells with the fractionation and found essentially the same profile as with asynchronous cells (Fig.4 B). The insoluble hCDC6 was still present in G2/M phase HeLa, where little hMCMs bind to chromatin (Fig.4 C). These data, in combination with the immunostaining, suggest the following: 1) in the G1 phase, hCDC6 is present mainly in nuclei, and a part of it is associated with the detergent- and nuclease-resistant nuclear structure; 2) in the S phase, hCDC6, probably present in the nucleoplasm in G1, is translocated to the cytoplasm, but the bound form is still present; and 3) it remains bound to the nuclear structure or condensed chromosomes in the G2/M phase. In our nuclear preparation, about 30% of the total chromatin still remains (34Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10928-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is currently unknown whether the structure to which hCDC6 binds is nuclear matrix or nuclease-resistant specific chromatin regions such as heterochromatin. Because the detergent-insoluble hCDC6 is extractable with the buffer containing 0.5m NaCl (data not shown), it is difficult with classical salt extraction to further strip the remnant chromatin from our nuclear preparation while preserving hCDC6 binding. This issue should be addressed in the future. Saha et al. (36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) suggest that hCDC6 protein may be selectively eliminated from nuclei in the S phase, and thereby DNA replication may be regulated. However, our data suggest that this is not necessarily the case. On the other hand, it is currently unclear whether the majority of the bound hCDC6 is actually associated with chromatin or not. Given the conservation of CDC6 function, the hCDC6 may bind to prereplication chromatin in G1. However, it might dissociate from chromatin in S phase, as suggested for the Xenopus egg system (42Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The data described above also suggest that major binding sites on chromatin differ between hMCMs and hCDC6. This is also supported by the observation that significant co-immunoprecipitation between hCDC6 and hMCM complex was undetectable in the solubilized chromatin fraction as well as in the Triton X-100-extractable fraction and that the levels of the bound hMCM7 were at least several times those of bound hCDC6 (data not shown). hCDC6 protein is suggested to physically interact with hORC1 (36Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and interestingly, it was found with the cell fractionation that almost all hORC1 protein may be associated with the detergent- and nuclease-resistant nuclear structure throughout the cell cycle. 2Y. Tatsumi, T. Tsurimoto, K. Shirahige, H. Yoshikawa, and C. Obuse, submitted for publication. It has been suggested that also in Xenopus eggs and yeast MCMs may not be tethered to chromatin via ORC and CDC6 (10Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 42Hua X.H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Rather these latter might act as loaders for MCMs, as does replication factor C for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (43Perkins G. Diffley J.F.X. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, hORC5 was shown to tightly bind to nucleus (44Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27137-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that hORC1, 2, 4, and 5 can form a complex (44Quintana D.G. Thome K.C. Hou Z. Ligon A.H. Morton C.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27137-27145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 45Quintana D.G. Hou Z. Thome K.C. Hendricks M. Saha P. Dutta A. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 270: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Taking the available information into consideration, we propose a hypothetical model as shown in Fig. 5 for the state of prereplication chromatin in human cell nuclei. In this model, hORC and hCDC6 are associated with chromatin on the detergent- and nuclease-resistant nuclear structure. The hMCM complexes are loaded, presumably by hORC/hCDC6, mainly onto the chromatin regions that are not associated with the nuclear structure. Given the analogy with the yeast system (11Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 13Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), however, it is possible that at least a small proportion of the hMCM complexes is loaded onto chromatin regions near hCDC6-binding sites. To address this point, the extracted nuclei from asynchronous HeLa cells were chemically cross-linked with DSP, then solubilized in 1% SDS buffer with sonication, and subjected to immunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 A). Because hMCM hexameric complexes are disrupted with SDS, anti-hMCM7 antibodies could not co-precipitate hMCM3 protein without cross-linking. However, with cross-linking, hMCM3 became efficiently co-precipitated with anti-hMCM7 antibodies as expected. Under such conditions, small but significant amounts of hMCM3 and 7 were co-precipitated with anti-hCDC6 antibodies. On the other hand, anti-hMCM7 antibodies could hardly co-precipitate hCDC6, possibly because of the existence of excess hMCM complexes that are not associated with hCDC6. Lamin B, one of the most abundant proteins in nuclei, was not co-precipitated in all of the cases tested. We further repeated the analysis with Epstein-Barr virus-infected Raji cells (Fig.6 B). In this case, reciprocal co-precipitation of hCDC6 with anti-hMCM7 antibodies as well as co-precipitation of hMCM7 with anti-hCDC6 was found. These data suggest that the notion described above may be correct.Figure 6Detection of hCDC6-hMCM complex interactions by immunoprecipitation of cross-linked nuclear fractions. A, Triton X-100-extracted nuclei from asynchronous HeLa cells were incubated with or without chemical cross-linker DSP and then solubilized with 1% SDS and sonication. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with ant-hCDC6 or anti-hMCM7 antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates (IP) and the lysates (input) were immunoblotted with ant-hCDC6, anti-hMCM7, anti-mMCM3, and anti-lamin B antibodies. B, the extracted nuclei from asynchronous Raji cells were incubated with DSP and processed as above. Anti-EBNA1 polyclonal antibodies were used as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our model is not necessarily similar to that for yeast and also has many problems. We have no information as to what chromatin region is associated with human initiator proteins. What is the significance of the association of the initiator proteins with the specific nuclear structure? In Xenopus egg extracts, specific nuclear structures and DNA sequences may not necessarily be required for replication (14Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this regard, during the process of differentiation, more complex regulation of nuclear functions would be expected to have evolved, requiring a more complex network of nuclear structures. It also remains unclear whether the chromatin-bound hMCM complexes spread over the entire chromatin or are clustered within regions near hCDC6. One possible way to address these points would be by immunoprecipitation assay for cross-linked chromatin. To assess the nature of the slow migrating form observed for bound hCDC6 in the G2/M phase (Figs. 2 and4 C), Triton X-100-extracted nuclei from G2/M phase HeLa cells were treated with λ-phosphatase. This resulted in conversion to the normally migrating form, a change that was inhibited by vanadate, an inhibitor for λ-phosphatase (Fig.7 A). These findings indicate that the bound hCDC6 is hyperphosphorylated at G2/M. CDC2 kinase is maximally active in late G2/M phase, can phosphorylate mammalian MCM2 and 4, and plays a crucial role in prohibiting reloading of mammalian MCM complexes (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.7 B, we found that purified CDC2/cyclin B can phosphorylate in vitro the hCDC6 immunoprecipitated from S phase HeLa cells and promote a shift in its mobility. We next examined its in vivo role using murine CDC2 kinase temperature-sensitive mutant FT210 cells (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 38Mineo C. Murakami Y. Ishimi Y. Hanaoka F. Yamada M. Exp.

Cell. 1990; 63: 313-324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Our antibodies could detect murine CDC6 protein, but most of it was distributed in the the detergent- and nuclease-resistant nuclear fraction in asynchronous FT210 cells (data not shown, but see below). The reason for the difference between the FT210 cells and tested human cells including HeLa, in which a significant amount of CDC6 is Triton-soluble, is currently unknown. The FT210 cells were incubated with nocodazole for 16 h at a permissive or a nonpermissive temperature for synchronization at the G2/M phase, and whole cell lysates, Triton X-100-extractable fractions, and nuclear pellets were prepared. Immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody 4A4 specific for CDC2-phosphorylated vimentin confirmed the CDC2 inactivation at a nonpermissive temperature (data not shown) as described previously (24Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The samples were then immunoblotted with anti-hCDC6 antibodies, showing the presence of slow migrating hyperphosphorylated murine CDC6 in the G2/M phase FT210 cells cultured at a permissive temperature and its conversion to the normally migrating form at a nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 7 C). We have repeated the experiment and consistently obtained the same result. Together, the data indicate that the hyperphosphorylation of the nuclear structure-bound CDC6 at G2/M phase is under the control of CDC2 kinase. Given that the bound form is active for regulation of DNA replication, a bound form-specific phosphorylation seems reasonable. Although the details are currently unknown, the function of CDC2 kinase to suppress the reloading of mammalian MCM complexes during G2/M phase might be mediated by the phosphorylation of CDC6 as well as phosphorylation of MCM complexes by CDC2 kinase (24Fujita M.

During preparing this manuscript, three related papers for mammalian CDC6 were published. Petersen et al. (47Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sørensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) reported that the cytoplasmic relocalization of mammalian CDC6 in S phase may be regulated by phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin A. However, because localization of CDC6 was only determined by immunostaining, the nucleus-bound form CDC6 was not well characterized in the study. On the other hand, Stoeber et al. (48Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7219-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that similar to the case in FT210 cells described above, almost all CDC6 is distributed in Triton-insoluble fraction in murine NIH3T3 cells, although it was not shown whether it is associated with chromatin or not. Williams et al. (49Williams G.H. Romanowski P. Morris L. Madine M. Mills A.D. Stoeber K. Marr J. Laskey R.A. Coleman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2073260774,"Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) expressed on endothelial cells leads to cellular migration and proliferation. We have examined the role of the Src homology (SH) 2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein Crk in these processes. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk in fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated endothelial cells was dependent on the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue 463 in FGFR-1, and a Crk SH2 domain precipitated FGFR-1 via phosphorylated Tyr-463, indicating direct complex formation between Crk and FGFR-1. Furthermore, Crk SH2 and SH3 domains formed ligand-independent complexes with Shc, C3G, and the Crk-associated substrate (Cas). Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas increased as a consequence of growth factor treatment. We examined the role of Crk in FGFR-1-mediated cellular responses by use of cells expressing chimeric platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α/FGFR-1 (αR/FR) wild type and mutant Y463F receptors. The kinase activity of αR/FR Y463F was intact, but both Crk and the adaptor FRS-2 were no longer tyrosine-phosphorylated in the mutant cells. Both wild type and mutant receptor cells migrated efficiently, whereas cells expressing the mutant αR/FR Y463F failed to proliferate and Erk2 and Jun kinase activities were suppressed in these cells. In wild type αR/FR cells transiently expressing an SH2 domain mutant of Crk, Erk and Jun kinase activities as well as DNA synthesis were attenuated. Our data indicate that Crk participates in signaling complexes downstream of FGFR-1, which propagate mitogenic signals. Stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) expressed on endothelial cells leads to cellular migration and proliferation. We have examined the role of the Src homology (SH) 2/SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein Crk in these processes. Transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk in fibroblast growth factor-2-stimulated endothelial cells was dependent on the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue 463 in FGFR-1, and a Crk SH2 domain precipitated FGFR-1 via phosphorylated Tyr-463, indicating direct complex formation between Crk and FGFR-1. Furthermore, Crk SH2 and SH3 domains formed ligand-independent complexes with Shc, C3G, and the Crk-associated substrate (Cas). Tyrosine phosphorylation of C3G and Cas increased as a consequence of growth factor treatment. We examined the role of Crk in FGFR-1-mediated cellular responses by use of cells expressing chimeric platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α/FGFR-1 (αR/FR) wild type and mutant Y463F receptors. The kinase activity of αR/FR Y463F was intact, but both Crk and the adaptor FRS-2 were no longer tyrosine-phosphorylated in the mutant cells. Both wild type and mutant receptor cells migrated efficiently, whereas cells expressing the mutant αR/FR Y463F failed to proliferate and Erk2 and Jun kinase activities were suppressed in these cells. In wild type αR/FR cells transiently expressing an SH2 domain mutant of Crk, Erk and Jun kinase activities as well as DNA synthesis were attenuated.

Their structural relatedness ranges from about 50% identity between the prototype members FGF-1 (acidic FGF) and FGF-2 (basic FGF) to about 20% between other members of the family. FGFs are mitogenic for a wide variety of cells in tissue culture and have been implicated in regulation of differentiation, cell motility, and transformation. FGFs have also been shown to be essential in normal physiological processes in vivo; these include embryonic and fetal development, neovascularization, and wound healing (6Folkman J. Klagsburn M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4046) Google Scholar, 7Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rifkin D.B. Moscatelli D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). FGFs induce their biological responses by binding to high affinity FGF receptors, which constitute a family of four (FGFR-1 to FGFR-4) structurally related transmembrane tyrosine kinases (9Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). The receptors contain two or three extracellular immunoglobulin-like loops, a characteristic stretch of acidic amino acids between the first and second loop, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular kinase domain split by a 14–17-amino acid-long kinase insert. Alternative splicing generates a multitude of structural variants that differ in ectodomain regions known to be involved in ligand binding (10Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Binding of FGF together with heparin or heparan sulfates to the receptor induces receptor dimerization, leading to kinase activation and autophosphorylation of the receptor. Autophosphorylated tyrosine residues and adjacent amino acids provide specific binding sites for intracellular signal transduction proteins containing Src homology (SH) 2 domains. SH2 domain-containing proteins are either enzymes or adaptor proteins, which may couple to enzymatic activities. Upon binding of SH2 domain proteins to the receptor, intrinsic or associated enzymatic activities transduce signals further in signaling cascades, eventually giving rise to a cellular response. The SH2 domain proteins are often equipped with other structurally conserved motifs such as the SH3 motif, which mediates constitutive binding to proline-rich stretches (11Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 12Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). FGFR-1 contains at least seven autophosphorylation sites (13Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar); thus far, only two of these sites, Tyr-653 and Tyr-766, have been shown to be important for receptor function. Tyr-653 is located in the kinase domain and appears to be involved in regulation of kinase activity. Tyr-766 is located in the C-terminal tail, and phosphorylation at this site allows binding of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (14Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Activation of PLCγ appears not to be required for FGF-induced proliferation, at least in stable cell lines (15Mohammadi M.

Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Other SH2 domain proteins of the adaptor type, such as Shc and the FGF receptor substrate 2 (FRS-2) become tyrosine-phosphorylated via FGFR-1, without stable complex-formation with the receptor (14Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J.

In this work we have studied the interaction between FGFR-1 and Crk II. v-Crk was originally identified as an oncoprotein of a chicken retrovirus, CT10 (19Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the corresponding cellular proto-oncogene was isolated (20Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 21Reichman C.T. Mayer B.J. Keshav S. Hanafusa H. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 451-460PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to exist in two splice variants, Crk I (28 kDa) and Crk II (42 kDa). Crk II consists of an SH2 domain followed by two SH3 domains, while Crk I lacks the second SH3 domain. In addition, another closely related gene, Crk L, has been identified (22ten Hoeve J. Morris C. Heisterkamp N. Groffen J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). Crk is tyrosine-phosphorylated in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated cells, but without apparent consequences for PDGF-induced cellular responses (23Yokote K. Hellman U. Ekman S. Saito Y. Ronnstrand L. Saito Y. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent data indicate a role for Crk in nerve growth factor-stimulated neuronal cells (24York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Crk in FGF-2-stimulated cells is dependent on the juxtamembrane tyrosine residue 463 in FGFR-1 and that Crk is critical for FGFR-1-induced cell proliferation. cDNAs for FGFR-1 (25Wennstrom S. Sandstrom C. Claesson-Welsh L. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), PDGFR-α (26Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and PDGFR-β (27Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) were subcloned into the pAlter vectorTM (Promega Corp.), and site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Altered Sites in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega Corp.). A schematic outline of the different receptor constructs used in this study is shown in Fig.1. The chimeric receptor PDGFR-α/FGFR-1 (denoted αR/FR) was constructed by cleaving the FGFR-1 and PDGFR-α cDNAs with Hin dIII and Sal I followed by ligation of the fragment corresponding to the extracellular part of PDGFR-α to that corresponding to the intracellular part of FGFR-1 (17Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using the mutagenesis system described, point mutations that changed Tyr-766 or Tyr-463 to phenylalanine residues, or created stop codon including cleavage site for Xba I at position 2323–2329 in the intracellular part from FGFR-1, were introduced into the cDNA for αR/FR. The wild type and mutated cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). We also used chimeric receptors in which the juxtamembrane domain or the kinase insert domain in FGFR-1 were replaced with the corresponding parts from the PDGFR-β, to create FR-1/PRβJM or FR-1/PRβKi. The construction of FR-1/PRβKi has been described before (28Wennstrom S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FR-1/PRβJM was constructed by point mutations creating cleavage site for Hin dIII and Nru I at positions 1195–1200 and 1425–1430 of the FGFR-1 and at positions 1861–1866 and 1974–1979 of the PDGFR-β, which were introduced into the respective insert with oligonucleotides prepared using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Gene Assemble Plus synthesizer. All mutations and constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. FR-1/PRβJM was then constructed by cleaving the FGFR-1 and PDGFR-β cDNAs with Hin dIII and Nru I followed by ligation of the fragment corresponding to the juxtamembrane domain of PDGFR-β into the position of the FGFR-1 endogenous Hin dIII-Nru I fragment. The wild type and the mutated cDNAs were inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA1/neo (Invitrogen). All mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Primary bovine adrenal cortex capillary endothelial (BCE) cells, kindly provided by Dr. Judah Folkman, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum and 3 ng/ml FGF-2 in 37 °C, 10% CO2. The porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cell lines were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The characteristics of PAE cells expressing PDGFRα/FGFR-1 (αR/FR wt), PDGFRα/FGFR-1 Y766F (αR/FR Y766F), PDGFα/FGFR-1 Y463F (αR/FR Y463F), and FR-1/PR-βKi have been published previously (17Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 28Wennstrom S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines used expressed similar levels of receptor proteins and bound the appropriate growth factor with affinities similar to those for wild type receptors. FGF-2 was purchased from Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy), and PDGF-BB was from Peprotech Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against Crk II, C3G, and SH-PTP2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific for phosphotyrosine (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, and an antibody against Shc was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-HA antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and phosphospecific MAPK antibody was from New England Biolabs, Inc. The rabbit antiserum against phospholipase Cγ and the rabbit antiserum against Erk-2 were kind gifts from Dr. Lars Rönnstrand, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. The rabbit antiserum against FGFR-1 has been described before (28Wennstrom S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a rabbit antiserum specifically reacting with FRS-2 was raised against a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal part of FRS-2. PAE cells expressing the wild type chimeric receptor αR/FR were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS to 30% confluence. Transfections were done by using SuperFect (Qiagen). For Erk 2 kinase assay, the cells were cultured in T-25 flasks and transfected with 2 μg each of cDNAs encoding HA-Erk and wild type Crk or the Crk SH2 domain mutant in the pCAGGS vector. For Jun kinase assay, the cells were cultured in T-25 flasks and transfected with 2 μg each of cDNAs encoding HA-Jun kinase in the pSRα vector and wild type Crk or the Crk SH2 domain mutant. For analysis of labeling index, cells were seeded out on glass placed in 60-mm dishes and transfected with wild type Crk or Crk SH2 domain mutant cDNA using the amount of cDNA needed to get the same amount of Crk expressed in all cells. In all experiments, transfection with only the vector was used as a control. The original Crk II cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Michiyuki Matsuda (Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan), the Crk cDNA expressing Crk II SH2 domain mutant was a kind gift from Dr. Kristiina Vuori (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), HA-Erk 2 was from Dr. Ivan Dikic (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden), and HA-Jun kinase was provided by Dr. Pär Gerwins (Department of Medical Biochemistry and Microbiology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden). Cells in 75-cm2 flasks were serum starved over night in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1% FCS, followed by stimulation with PDGF-BB (100 ng ml−1) or FGF-2 (100 ng ml−1) for 7 min or for different time periods, as indicated, at 37 °C. The monolayers were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 μm Na3VO4 and lysed for 10 min on ice in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 300 μm Na3VO4, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT)). Lysates were clarified at 10.000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by a final incubation for 45 min with immobilized protein A (Immunosorb; EC Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden). The precipitates were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice in PBS containing 100 μmNa3VO4. Sample buffer (0.2 mTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.5 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and the samples were boiled for 4 min at 95 °C before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10% gels. For immunoblotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked in 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Primary antibody was diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% BSA and incubated with membranes for 1 h, followed by washing in PBS. Appropriate secondary antibody was diluted as above and incubated with the membranes for another 1 h. After careful washing in PBS, immunoreactive proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection system based on a protocol described earlier (29Matthews J.A. Batki A. Hynds C. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Before reprobing the filters, they were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. The SH2 domain of Grb2 was expressed as a part of a GST fusion protein (a kind gift from Dr. J Schlessinger, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY), and used as described earlier (14Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23337-23344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of Crk II and the SH2-SH3 domains of CrkII were also expressed as GST fusion proteins and were kindly provided by Dr. A. Sorokin (Dept. of Medicine and Cardiovascular Research Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI). For association experiments, transfected PAE cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and serum starved over night in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 1% FCS, followed by treatment or not with growth factors for 7 min at 37 °C, and then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Clarified lysates were incubated with purified immobilized GST fusion protein (Grb2 SH2, Crk II SH2 or Crk II SH2 SH3) on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice in PBS containing 100 μmNa3VO4 and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as described above. The following synthetic peptide, phosphorylated at its tyrosine residue (indicated as pY), was used in this study: pY463, GVSEpYELPEDPRWELPR-COOH. The corresponding nonphosphorylated peptide was also synthesized and used as a control. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, as described by Mori et al. (30Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Immobilization of synthetic peptides on agarose beads (Affi-Gel-15, Bio-Rad) was performed according to the company's instructions. Briefly, 2 mg of the peptide was dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and mixed with 1 ml 1:1 slurry of prewashed Affi-Gel-15 agarose, and incubated end-over-end for 1 h at room temperature. To block the remaining active esters on the agarose, the beads were incubated in 100 mm ethanolamine HCl, pH 8, for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing in Tris/HCl-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm DTT. Cells cultured in 75-cm2 flasks were washed in ice-cold PBS containing 100 μmNa3VO4 and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin, and 200 μmNa3VO4). Cell lysates were clarified at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the samples were then incubated with phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated peptides immobilized on Affi-Gel-15, in the presence or absence of free competing peptide, end-over-end for 1 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed twice in RIPA buffer, three times in RIPA buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl (high salt RIPA), and once with RIPA buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, as described above. The assay was performed in a modified Boyden chamber as described earlier (31Auerbach R. Auerbach W. Polakowski I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using micropore nitrocellulose filters (8 μm thick, 8 μm pore) coated with type-1 collagen solution at 100 μg ml−1 (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corp.). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 5.5 × 105 cells ml−1 in serum-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA. The cell suspension was placed in the upper chamber, and the serum-free medium containing 0.25% BSA and 10 ng ml−1 or 50 ng ml−1 of PDGF-BB, was placed below the filter in the lower chamber. As a positive control, medium containing 10% FCS was added to the lower chamber. After 6 h at 37 °C, the medium was removed and the cells sticking to the filter were fixed in pure methanol and stained with Giemsa stain. The cells that had migrated through the filter were counted. All samples were analyzed in triplicate at four separate occasions. Cells in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS were seeded (2 × 104 cells/well) into 24-well dishes. After 2 h the medium was changed to starvation medium (Ham's F-12 containing 0.2% FCS) and the incubation continued for an additional 24 h. The medium was changed again at day 2 and day 4 (starvation medium), and at the same time PDGF-BB or FGF-2 at different concentrations (0, 1, 10, 20, and 100 ng ml−1) were added. As a control, cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. Cell numbers were scored after 5 days. All experiments were performed in triplicate for every concentration of PDGF-BB, and at least two independent cell clones for the chimeric wild type and the mutated (Y463F) receptors were analyzed. After treatment of cells with 100 ng ml−1 PDGF-BB for 7 min at 37 °C, cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μmNa3VO4 and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mmNa4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, and 1 mmDTT). Clarified supernatants were incubated with Erk-2 antiserum, raised against a C-terminal MAP 2 kinase peptide (EETARFQPGYRS), end-over-end for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immobilized protein A (Immunosorb) was added, and the samples were mixed at 4 °C for 30 min. The immune complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm DTT) and then incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP, Sigma) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The kinase reaction was terminated by addition of 40 μl of sample buffer and boiling for 4 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After fixation in methanol/acetic acid, the gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Erk 2 kinase activity, in transiently transfected cells expressing HA-Erk 2, wild type Crk, or Crk SH2 domain mutant, was also measured by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as described above. Erk 2 was immunoprecipitated by using HA antibodies, and immunoblotting was performed using phosphospecific MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc.). A solid phase assay was used, where c-Jun-(1–79) was expressed as a part of a GST fusion protein and coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B. The experiment was performed as described by Gerwins et al. (32Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, chimeric PAE cells were stimulated with 100 ng ml−1PDGF-BB or left untreated for 7 min at 37 °C and then lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Clarified lysates were incubated with immobilized GST-c-Jun-(1–79)-Sepharose 4B end-over-end 1 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2 mm MnCl2, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). The beads were resuspended in kinase buffer supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per sample. The reactions were performed at 30 °C for 20 min and were terminated by addition of Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 4 min, and phosphorylated proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Jun kinase activity, in transiently transfected cells expressing HA-Jun kinase, wild type Crk, or Crk SH2 domain mutant, was measured by immunoprecipitation and a kinase reaction as above. Jun kinase was immunoprecipitated by using HA antibodies, and GST Jun-(1–79) was added as a substrate in the kinase reaction. PAE cells expressing wild type αR/FR were cultured on coverslips and transiently transfected with wild type Crk and Crk SH2 domain mutant as described above. The cells were then starved overnight in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 0.25% BSA and labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for the last 2 h during culture. The cells were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and covered with autoradiography emulsion (Eastman Kodak Corp.). After 1 week of exposure, the film was developed and unlabeled cells were stained with Mayer hematoxylin (Histolab Products AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). The cells were counted, and the results show percentage of labeled nuclei for three different experiments. Chimeric PDGFR-α/FGFR-1 (αR/FR) wild type and mutant proteins were ectopically expressed in PAE cells, in order to study FGFR-1 signal transduction without interference of endogenous FGF receptors. The PAE cells express low levels of endogenous FGF receptors, but lack expression of PDGF receptors (28Wennstrom S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Westermark B. Siegbahn A. Heldin C.H. Claesson-Welsh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PAE cells expressing the αR/FR wild type protein migrate and proliferate efficiently in response to PDGF-BB (17Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Using this model, we addressed the role of the FGFR-1 juxtamembrane tyrosine phosphorylation site Tyr-463 in signal transduction. The abilities of PAE cells expressing the wild type αR/FR and two independent clones of PAE cells expressing the mutant αR/FR Y463F to proliferate in response to growth factor (Fig.2) were analyzed. The number of wild type αR/FR cells increased dose-dependently from 100% (control, serum-starved cells) to 250% for cells treated with 20 or 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB. A similar response was seen for PAE cells expressing the mutant αR/FR Y766F, in which the PLCγ binding site is removed. PAE cells expressing intact FGFR-1 also increased in number to 250% of control in response to FGF-2 treatment. In contrast, untransfected PAE cells and two different clones of the αR/FR Y463F cells failed to increase in cell number at any of the concentrations of PDGF-BB used. All cell types responded similarly to treatment with 10% FCS (data not shown). Thus, loss of Tyr-463 interfered with the capacity of the FGFR-1 intracellular domain to mediate signals for proliferation. The abilities of PAE cells expressing the wild type αR/FR and cells expressing the mutant αR/FR Y463F to migrate in a mini-Boyden chamber were examined. Cells were seeded on one side of a collagen-coated 8-mm-thick nitrocellulose filter, and the growth factor was suspended i"
https://openalex.org/W1997225668,"Goodpasture disease is a prototype autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of autoantibodies against the heterotrimeric basement membrane collagen type IV, which causes a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The pathogenic antibody response is directed to the non-collagenous (NC1) domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3(IV)NC1), but not to the homologous region of the α1(IV)NC1. To identify the conformation-dependent immunodominant epitope on the α3(IV)NC1, a variety of recombinant NC1 domains were constructed by replacing single residues of α3(IV) with the corresponding amino acids from the nonreactive α1(IV) chain. Replacement mutations were identified that completely destroyed the Goodpasture epitope in the α3(IV) chain. Based on the identification of these critical positions, the epitope was finally reconstructed within the frame of the α1(IV) chain. The substitution of nine discontinuous positions in the α1(IV)NC1 with amino acid residues from the α3 chain resulted in a recombinant construct that was recognized by all patients' sera (n = 20) but by none of the sera from healthy controls (n = 10). This provides, for the first time, the molecular characterization of a single immunodominant conformational epitope recognized by pathogenic autoantibodies in a human autoimmune disease, representing the basis for the development of new epitope-specific strategies in the treatment of Goodpasture disease.

The criteria demand that an adaptive immune response to a self-antigen cause the observed pathology, as evidenced by transfer of the disease in either a natural situation (for example, from mother to child via the placenta) or an experimental disease model (via autoantigen-specific antibodies or lymphocytes) (1Rose N.R. Bona C. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 426-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). In Goodpasture syndrome, the complex formation of autoantibodies with self-structures in the glomerular basement membrane causes a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, often accompanied by life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage. The self-epitope is localized to the NC1 domain of the α3 chain of type IV collagen (α3(IV)NC1), a major basement membrane component of kidney glomeruli and pulmonary alveoli, thus explaining the tissue distribution of the disease. The pathogenic role of the B-cell response to this self-antigen is clearly supported not only by the transfer of disease to monkeys using kidney-bound autoantibodies from Goodpasture patients (2Lerner R.A. Glassock R.J. Dixon F.J. J. Exp. Med. 1967; 126: 989-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) but also by the therapeutic efficacy of removal of circulating antibodies by plasma exchange, as well as that of immunosuppressive treatments (3Turner N. Lockwood C.M. Rees A.J. Schrier R.W. Gottschalk C.W. Diseases of the Kidney. Little Brown and Company, Boston1993: 1865-1894Google Scholar). The name Goodpasture syndrome was given in 1958 by Stanton and Tange (4Stanton M.C. Tange J.D. Aust. Ann. Med. 1958; 7: 132-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in recognition of a patient described by Ernest Goodpasture in 1919 (5Goodpasture E.W. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1919; 158: 863-870Crossref Google Scholar). In 1984, the antigen was identified as a new subunit of the NC1 domain of type IV collagen (6Wieslander J. Bygren P. Heinegard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1544-1548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This resulted in the cloning of the antigen (7Saus J. Wieslander J. Langeveld J.P.M. Quinones S. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13374-13380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the designation of the α3(IV) chain. The epitope has been characterized as a cryptotope because disintegration of the supramolecular arrangement of the basement membrane type IV collagen by denaturants leads to the exposure of critical epitope determinants, thereby enhancing the immunoreactivity with patient sera (8Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, chemical reduction completely abolishes immunoreactivity, indicating the involvement of disulfide bonds in the stabilization of the epitope. These features clearly indicate the involvement of a three-dimensional epitope that is normally hidden inside the intact glomerular basement membrane. Remarkably, despite an expected inter-patient variability, the ELISA1 reactivity of the patients' autoantibodies has been successfully blocked with a monoclonal antibody (9Pusey C.D. Dash A. Kershaw M.J. Morgan A. Reilly A. Rees A.J. Lockwood C.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 56: 23-31PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), indicating a limited epitope recognition. The carboxyl-terminal end of the α3(IV)NC1 domain has been suggested to harbor the Goodpasture epitope, based on a study using synthetic peptides (11Kalluri R. Gunwar S. Reeders S.T. Morrison K.C. Mariyama M. Ebner K.E. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24018-24024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this study suffered from the disadvantage of using linear peptides to characterize a three-dimensional epitope; therefore, the results could not be subsequently confirmed. In turn, more recent studies have pointed out the importance of the amino-terminal region of the NC1 domain (12Quinones S. Bernal D. Garcia-Sogo M. Elena S.F. Saus J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19780-19784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Hudson B.G. Neilson E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Ryan J.J. Mason P.J. Pusey C.D. Turner N. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 113: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Along this line, our group has recently shown that only autoantibodies reacting with the amino-terminal portion of the α3(IV)NC1 have a pathological impact on kidney survival (15Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Several studies aimed at identifying antibody epitopes of potential pathogenic relevance have also been performed using experimental animal models of autoimmune diseases. In contrast, little is known about epitopes in human autoimmune diseases at a molecular level, most likely due to methodological problems related to a diverse reactivity pattern of the autoantibodies. More importantly, conformational requirements of the epitopes may limit the application of linear synthetic peptides for mapping strategies. Therefore, an experimental procedure was chosen that allows the expression of the antigen as a recombinant protein in a human cell line (HEK-293). This strategy enables the construction of a variety of properly folded chimeric molecules in which the α3(IV)NC1 sequence, which harbors the Goodpasture epitope, can be progressively replaced by the corresponding sequence of the homologous α1(IV)NC1, which is not recognized by the toxic autoantibodies. Indeed, the high homology between both chains, as well as the conserved disulfide bonds, enhances the likelihood for proper folding of the hybrid constructs as a prerequisite for conformation-dependent autoantibody binding. The present study focuses on the molecular characterization of the Goodpasture epitope in the amino-terminal part of the α3(IV)NC1 domain, to which the antibody response correlates with kidney disease. For this purpose, chimeric constructs were devised in which the clinically irrelevant central and carboxyl-terminal parts of the NC1 domain were expressed as α1(IV). The sera of 20 Goodpasture patients with biopsy-proven anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis were obtained from the serum bank at the Department of Nephrology, Lund University. All patients showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with linear deposits of IgG in direct immunofluorescence. Seven of the patients also had an overt lung hemorrhage. The mean age was 49 years (range, 18–78 years; 10 males and 10 females). The mean serum creatinine level at the time of diagnosis was 920 μmol/liter, and 12 of the patients were maintained on dialysis, 4 had died, and 4 survived with native functional kidneys after 6 months of follow-up. Sera from 10 healthy age-matched blood donors were used as controls. Monoclonal antibodies against type X collagen (clone X53 (16Girkontaite I. Frischholz S. Lammi P. Wagner K. Swoboda B.

Butkowski R. Wieslander J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1991; 25: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were used for standardization of the ELISAs and for immunoblotting experiments. HEK-293 cells were cultured in 90-mm cell culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 (1:1) with 5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For each construct, 5 μg of the linearized plasmid DNA was transfected into 1 × 106 HEK-293 cells using an electroporator (Bio-Rad) with electrical settings of 200 V and 640 microfarads in a 0.4-cm cuvette. The transfected cells were seeded onto a new plate, and, after 48 h, selection was started by supplementation with 800 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was renewed every 2 days, and collection of the supernatants was started when the G418-resistant cells reached confluence. During harvesting, the transfected cells were kept in fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with ascorbate (18Schulte S. Unger C. Mo J.A. Wendler O. Bauer E.

The full-length type X collagen cDNA in the pBluescript SK− vector was cloned between the Hin dIII and Not I sites. Both plasmids were cleaved with Bam HI and Not I, and the α3(IV)NC1 cDNA was ligated into the internal Bam HI site of type X collagen cDNA. This construct contained five unique restriction enzyme sites: a Hin dIII site in the 5′ end of the construct, a Bam HI site in the junction between the type X collagen and the type IV collagen NC1, Hin dII and Xba I in the α3(IV)NC1 cDNA, and a Not I site 3′ of the coding DNA. The Bam HI, Hin dII, Xba I, and Not I cleavage sites were introduced into the α1(IV)NC1 cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp 2400) using primers 1–6. Upon restriction with the appropriate enzymes, the fragments of the α1(IV)NC1 cDNA were used to replace the corresponding cassettes of the wild type α3(IV) sequence, as described previously (15Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The constructs were restricted with Hin dIII and Not I and subcloned into a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression vector (pcDNA3; Invitrogene, Leek, the Netherlands). Because the major epitope region could be localized to the amino-terminal domain of the α3(IV)NC1 (the D1 construct in Table II), this region was subjected to further mutational analysis.Table IIConstruction design (see Fig. 1 for nomenclature and amino acid positions)NameConstructNo. of immunoreactive sera2-an = 20 patients with biopsy-proven Goodpasture disease.

The immunoreactivity was assessed by ELISA experiments (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Open table in a new tab For the construction of six α1/α3(IV) chimeric NC1 domains (the D2–D7 constructs in Table II), the overlap extension polymerase chain reaction technique (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar) was applied using the primers 6–20 in Table I, using the D1 construct as a template. Fourteen positions were selected for mutational analysis in a chimeric construct that harbors the amino-terminal α3(IV) NC1 (from A to G in Fig. 1). The selection criteria were based on the identity in human and bovine α3(IV) sequences, as well as on concurrent, nonconserved exchanges in the corresponding amino acid residues of the human α1(IV) and α5(IV) sequences. These 14 amino acid residues are emphasized in Fig. 1 by numbering their positions in the sequence. The point mutations were introduced in the D1 construct by the megaprimer method (20Barik S. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology. 15. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1993: 277-286Google Scholar) using primers 6, 7, and 21–34. As the last step, replacement mutations were introduced into chimeric constructs comprising the entire α1(IV)NC1 domain. By site-directed mutagenesis, five and nine codons were changed from wild type α1(IV) to the corresponding α3(IV), respectively. The substitutions were introduced by an overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6824) Google Scholar) using primers 6 and 7 with primers 35–40 and primers 6 and 7 with primers 15, 16, 19, 20, 39, and 40, respectively. After sequencing, all constructs were tested for the translation of a protein with the correct molecular weight using an in vitro system (Promega, Madison, WI) with [35S]cysteine and T7 RNA polymerase. Before transfection, the plasmid DNA was linearized using Sca I. Native type IV collagen NC1 domains were purified as described previously (10Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and coated at 0.5 μg/ml. The coating efficiency of the different recombinant proteins was calibrated by their equal immunoreactivity with the anti-collagen type X monoclonal antibody (16Girkontaite I. Frischholz S. Lammi P. Wagner K. Swoboda B. Aigner T. von der Mark K. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Human sera were diluted 1:100, and the monoclonal antibodies were diluted 1:1000. The ELISA was performed following standard procedures (10Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated swine anti-human IgG (Orion Diagnostica AB, Trosa, Sweden) or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) as secondary antibodies. Results were considered positive when the absorbance values exceeded the mean + 2 S.D. of 10 healthy control sera. Notably, none of the control sera was positive in any ELISA. Dilutions of human sera were adjusted to give the same absorbance after 1 h in a conventional ELISA with purified native type IV collagen NC1 domains and preincubated overnight at 4 °C with the different inhibitors, i.e. recombinant or purified native proteins in concentrations ranging from 0.0025 to 25 μg/ml. The amount of IgG that reacted with surface-bound Goodpasture antigen (despite the presence of inhibitor molecules in the fluid phase) was determined after extensive washing procedures with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies as described above. One ml of the cell supernatants was precipitated with Triton X-100 and trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10–16% gradient gels under nonreducing conditions (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Immunoblot experiments were performed on samples that were separated with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Saint-Quentin, France) (22Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5905) Google Scholar). For the construction of recombinant chimeric molecules that harbor the Goodpasture epitope, the amino-terminal two-thirds of the α1 chain of type X collagen, including the leader sequence, was fused to the NC1 domain of type IV collagen (Fig.1). The use of type X collagen in the amino-terminal part of the recombinant molecule results in a protein that is exported from the cells into the cell culture medium. Furthermore, the type X collagen part of the molecule is invariable and can therefore serve as a flag for protein detection. The epitope mapping strategy with these constructs comprised four subsets of experiments: 1) the NC1 domain was divided into three parts and separately replaced the α3(IV) sequence with the corresponding α1(IV) sequence for each part. This was done in a previous study and showed that the amino-terminal portion of the α3(IV)NC1 harbors the major Goodpasture epitope and that only antibodies against this part of the molecule correlate with kidney disease (15Hellmark T. Segelmark M. Unger C. Burkhardt H. Saus J. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 936-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); 2) the immunoreactive sequence was further narrowed down in the amino-terminal part of the α3(IV)NC1 domain; 3) point mutations were introduced in the α3(IV)NC1 to identify replacements that interfere with antibody recognition; and 4) amino acid substitutions were performed in the α1(IV)NC1 at selected positions that reconstituted the Goodpasture epitope in a domain that is normally not recognized by the patient sera. To narrow down the sequence within the D1 construct that harbors the major epitope, six different constructs were generated that contained replacements of different parts of the amino-terminal domain of α3(IV)NC1 with the corresponding sequences from the α1(IV). These six chimeric proteins were designated D2–D7 (Table II). All sera (n = 20) reacted with the D2, D3, and D5 chimeric proteins, whereas no antibody binding to D4 and D7 was detectable. A subset of four sera also reacted with the D6 chimeric protein. Thus, reactivity of the Goodpasture sera with the constructs indicated the localization of the major epitope to a region consisting of 42 amino acid residues between the positions C and F (as shown in Fig. 1). However, for 20% of the sera, the requirements for antibody recognition remained confined to the 15 amino acid residues of α3(IV) from position C to E (Fig. 1). Comparison of the amino acid sequences for the α1(IV) and α3(IV) chains revealed 33 nonconserved residues in the amino-terminal portion of the NC1 domain from position A to G (Fig. 1). For the identification of amino acid differences of critical importance for antibody binding, the sequence comparison was extended to bovine α3(IV) and human α5(IV) sequences. This strategy was chosen because bovine α3(IV) is recognized by autoantibodies from Goodpasture patients, in contrast to the nonreactive human α5(IV) (23Kalluri R. Wilson C.B. Weber M. Gunwar S. Chonko A.M. Neilson E.G. Hudson B.G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1995; 6: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only positions with identity in the human and bovine α3(IV) sequences but with differences from the corresponding human α1(IV) and α5(IV) sequences were then selected for the introduction of replacement mutations. The criterion was fulfilled by 14 amino acid residues, the localization of which is indicated by the numbering of positions 1–14 in Fig. 1. In these positions, the α3(IV)-specific codons were replaced with the corresponding α1(IV) residues in construct D1 (Table II), resulting in different chimeric molecules that harbor a single amino acid exchange (named P1–P14 in Table II). Despite slight differences in the reactivity of sera from different individuals with the recombinant proteins, two of the constructs, namely P9 and P10, remained totally negative with all patients' sera, whereas the mutations P6, P7, and P13 at least partially abolished their reactivity. The results on the localization of critical positions for immunoreactivity by single amino acid residue substitutions were in concordance with the effect of replacement mutations of longer stretches of the α3(IV) sequence by the corresponding α1(IV) domains in the amino-terminal portion of the NC1 domain. Thus, all essential positions localize within the same 42-amino acid-long region (between position C and F in Fig. 1) that has been shown in the above-described experiments to require α3(IV) sequences for binding of the Goodpasture sera. The reactivity of the four sera that remained insensitive to the Q to R mutation in the P13 construct, in contrast to the majority of Goodpasture samples (n = 16), had previously been shown to be restricted to a subdomain of the critical region (from position C to E in Fig. 1) that does not include the P13 position. Based on the knowledge of positions in the α3(IV)NC1, in which a single replacement mutation can destroy immunoreactivity, we attempted the reconstruction of the Goodpasture epitope, within the frame of the nonreactive α1(IV)NC1, by site-directed mutagenesis of five and nine amino acid residues, respectively. First, the five critical residues in positions P6, P7, P9, P10, and P13 (with a negative effect of mutations on autoantibody binding) were replaced in the α1(IV)NC1 with the corresponding amino acid residues I, S, P, S, and Q from the α3(IV) sequence (construct S1 in Table II). Second, four additional nonconserved residues were substituted that are localized in the region between position C and E in Fig. 1. The resulting α1(IV)NC1 construct harbored eight amino acid substitutions from the α3(IV) sequence between position C and E in Fig. 1 and the amino acid exchange R to Q in the P13 position (construct S2 in Table II). The first construct, S1, reacted only weakly with Goodpasture sera in immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 2); also, the mutational changes were insufficient to render the molecule reactive with patient sera in ELISA. In contrast, the second chimeric protein, S2, was recognized by all sera in both immunoblotting (Fig. 2) and ELISA, thereby indicating that the reactivity of the Goodpasture autoantibodies is directed toward this limited region in the NC1 domain of type IV collagen. Notably, in this respect, there was no difference between the epitope specificities of autoantibodies from patients with or without overt lung bleeding. In contrast to the 20 Goodpasture patients, there was no reactivity in the 10 sera of healthy humans used as a control (Fig. 3). All reactivity of the Goodpasture sera disappears upon reduction of the antigens (data not shown).Figure 3Immunoreactivity against the chimeric construct S2 (see Table II for details) of Goodpasture sera (n = 20) (13 patients without overt lung hemorrhage (•) and 7 patients with lung hemorrhage (○)) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 10) (■). ELISA experiments showed a clear distinction between the Goodpasture patients and the healthy control populations. The cut off value (the mean value of the healthy controls + 2 S.D.) is indicated as a horizontal line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The affinity of the proteins to the Goodpasture sera (n = 20) was determined by inhibition ELISA experiments using recombinant α3(IV)NC1, D1, S1, and S2 to block the binding to native NC1 domains from type IV collagen (Fig.4). The results confirmed that the major epitope in Goodpasture syndrome is preserved in the S2 chimeric protein, whereas the S1 construct proved insufficient for competitive binding, thus consistent with the results of a conventional ELISA shown in Table II. Below saturation, the D1 and S2 chimeric proteins bound to the Goodpasture antibodies with an affinity comparable to recombinant α3(IV)NC1. The maximal inhibitory capacity, in turn, differed slightly between D1 and S2 on one side (approximately 85%, ranging from 65% to 90%) and the complete α3(IV)NC1 (virtually 100%). Thus, as many as 85% of the autoantibodies present in the Goodpasture sera recognized an epitope that was fully contained in the critical nine amino acid residues presented in the S2 construct (Table II). Conversely, it was likewise remarkable that only 15% of the patient autoantibodies recognized unrelated structures. These observations were observed consistently in all 20 Goodpasture patients. This study provides the first molecular characterization of a conformational B-cell epitope that is the univocal target of pathogenic autoantibodies in a human autoimmune disease. In Goodpasture syndrome, the anti-type IV collagen autoantibodies cause immune complex formation in the basement membranes of the kidney glomeruli and lung alveoli, thereby leading to fatal kidney disease and lung bleeding. Because the toxic autoantibodies are highly selective for the α3 chain of the heterotrimeric type IV collagen, its immunoreactive domains were subjected to a mutation analysis by replacements with the corresponding sequences of the nonreactive, highly homologous α1(IV) chain in chimeric recombinant constructs. Although the different sera showed small differences in fine specificity, this mapping strategy allowed the identification nine amino acid residues in the amino-terminal part of the α3(IV)NC1 as the recognition site of all 20 sera derived from biopsy-proven Goodpasture patients. Replacement mutations of these nine amino acid residues from the α3(IV) into the wild-type α1(IV) sequence converted the nonreactive α1(IV)NC1 into a recombinant hybrid molecule that was recognized by all patients' sera with comparable affinity to that of the native purified Goodpasture antigen, as shown by competition ELISA. In contrast to most other autoimmune diseases, 100% of the patients with Goodpasture disease have autoantibodies against the α3(IV) chain. Furthermore, all Goodpasture patients have one major epitope. In another autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis, antibodies against type II collagen are found in 30–70% of the samples (25Ahmed E.E. Peters J.B. Shoenfeld Y. Autoantibodies. Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands1996: 185-194Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, at least in animal models of collagen II-induced arthritis, there seem to be antibodies against several different epitopes (18Schulte S. Unger C. Mo J.A. Wendler O. Bauer E. Frischholz S. von der Mark K. Kalden J.R. Holmdahl R. Burkhardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1551-1561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which complicates the epitope mapping considerably. The identified nine amino acid residues are localized in the amino-terminal part of the α3(IV)NC1 and form a discontinuous epitope in close vicinity to the cysteine residues, which are critically involved in the folding of the NC1 domain (24Siebold B. Deutzmann R. Kühn K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). The formation of disulfide bonds between the cysteine residues stabilizes the tertiary structure in the native NC1 domain, bringing the identified amino acid residues in a reciprocal spatial relationship that is critical for antibody recognition. Conversely, it is very likely that breakage of the disulfide bonding dramatically affects the position of the critical residues, consistent with earlier results documenting the loss of immunoreactivity upon reduction of the Goodpasture antigen (8Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epitope localization within the complex suprastucture of the basement membrane cannot be predicted at present, due to the lack of appropriate structural models. Thus, the extent to which the critical amino acid residues are normally exposed to the immune system and which mechanisms enhance the accessibility for autoimmune recognition in vivo remain a matter of speculation. Whereas the etiology of Goodpasture syndrome is still unknown, the restricted reactivity of autoantibodies from different patients strongly indicates an antigen-driven autoimmune process. It is therefore tantalizing to speculate that an immune response to a heterologous determinant of an infectious agent may mimic the Goodpasture epitope in the amino-terminal part of the α3(IV)NC1. The close correlation between the specificity of the autoantibody response and the clinical outcome indicates, in any case, that the epitope is part of a region with important biological function, e.g. the maintenance of basement membrane integrity. This may be disturbed by the interference of antibody binding with the homotypic interactions of the collagen molecules in the meshwork association. The present investigation provides important structural information about the immunodominant B-cell epitope in Goodpasture syndrome. This is the first example in a human autoimmune disease of a conformation-dependent epitope, which is recognized by the pathogenic autoantibodies in all affected individuals but by none of the sera from healthy controls. Moreover, spreading of the autoantibody response to other determinants seems to be a rather limited event in Goodpasture disease. This new information may prove valuable not only for diagnostic and prognostic purposes but also for the development of therapeutic epitope-specific immunomodulatory strategies. The present study may also bear important implications for the understanding of other human autoimmune diseases.

There are two forms of HB-EGF, the membrane-anchored form (pro-HB-EGF) and the soluble form (sHB-EGF). We studied the biological activity of pro-HB-EGF by using a model in which pro-HB-EGF-expressing effector cells was co-cultured with EGFR-expressing target cells. The DER cell, an EGFR-expressing derivative of the interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic 32D cell line, grows well in the presence of EGF or sHB-EGF without IL-3. When DER cells were co-cultured on a monolayer of Vero-H cells overexpressing pro-HB-EGF, growth inhibition and subsequent apoptosis were induced in the DER cells even in the presence of excess amounts of EGF or sHB-EGF. Such growth inhibition of DER cells was abrogated when specific antagonists for pro-HB-EGF were added in the culture medium or when direct contact of DER cells with Vero-H cells was prevented, indicating that pro-HB-EGF is involved in this inhibitory effect. Pro-HB-EGF-induced apoptosis of DER cells was also observed even in the presence of IL-3. This rules out the possibility of simple competition between soluble EGFR ligands and pro-HB-EGF. Moreover, 32D cells expressing EGFR mutant composed of the extracellular and the transmembrane domain of EGFR and the cytoplasmic domain of erythropoietin receptor did not undergo apoptosis by co-culture with Vero-H cells, indicating that the inhibitory signal induced by pro-HB-EGF-expressing Vero-H cells is mediated to DER cells via EGFR and that the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR is essential for pro-HB-EGF-induced apoptosis. From these results, we concluded that pro-HB-EGF has unique biological activity through cell-cell contact that is distinct from the activity of sHB-EGF.

A number of molecules of different functional categories play a role in this interaction. Growth factors, cytokines, and their receptors are important constituents of intercellular signaling. Until recently, growth factors or cytokines had been recognized to be soluble proteins usually found in blood or other body fluid, and many studies have been done to understand the function of these soluble factors. However, recent studies revealed that several growth factors and cytokines are synthesized as membrane-anchored proteins and that such membrane-anchored forms may have functions distinct from the soluble forms. For example, the epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 family of growth factors, tumor necrosis factor-α, colony-stimulating factor-1, c-Kit ligands 1 and 2, ligands for Eph family (B type of ephrins), and Fas ligand are synthesized as membrane-anchored forms, and these transmembrane forms are biologically active. In the case of transforming growth factor-α, the membrane-anchored form is mitogenically active and transduces the mitogenic signal to neighboring cells by cell-cell contact, termed “juxtacrine stimulation” (1Anklesaria P.

Med. 1998; 4: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), the membrane-anchored form is fully biologically active, but the soluble form shows limited or no biological function. Thus, it is now clear that the membrane-anchored forms of growth factors and cytokines are not only precursor proteins of the soluble factors but also biologically active proteins having unique roles in cell-to-cell interaction. Despite the importance of studying membrane-anchored growth factors, not many studies on the biological functions of membrane-anchored growth factors and the molecular mechanisms through which they act have been done due to the lack of suitable methods. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) was first identified as a 20–22-kDa glycoprotein in a conditioned medium of macrophage-like cells (10Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). It is structurally a member of the EGF family, which encompasses a number of structurally homologous mitogens including EGF, transforming growth factor-α, vaccinia virus growth factor, amphiregulin, β-cellulin, epiregulin, and neuregulin-1 and -2 (for a review, see Ref. 11Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 179-199PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to other EGF-family growth factors, HB-EGF binds to the EGFR, thereby inducing phosphorylation. More recently, HB-EGF has been shown to bind and stimulate HER4 as well as EGFR (12Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). HB-EGF can bind to heparin and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (11Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 179-199PubMed Google Scholar). Like other members of the EGF family, HB-EGF is synthesized as a transmembrane protein (pro-HB-EGF) and can be cleaved on the plasma membrane to yield soluble HB-EGF (sHB-EGF) (13Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). sHB-EGF is a potent mitogen for a number of cells including NIH3T3 cells, smooth muscle cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and kidney tubule cells (for a review, see Ref. 11Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: 179-199PubMed Google Scholar). Not only is pro-HB-EGF the precursor protein of sHB-EGF, but pro-HB-EGF itself is a biologically active protein. Pro-HB-EGF is known to be the specific receptor for diphtheria toxin (DT) and mediates endocytosis of the receptor-bound DT, resulting in entry of its A fragment into the cytoplasm (15Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 16Naglich J.G. Metherall J.E. Russel D.W. Eidels L. Cell. 1992; 69: 1051-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). As a growth factor, pro-HB-EGF has mitogenic activity to neighboring cells in a juxtacrine mode when pro-HB-EGF-expressing cells are fixed with formalin (17Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). A feature of pro-HB-EGF that is distinct from other membrane-anchored growth factors is that it forms a complex with other membrane proteins. CD9, a tetramembrane-spanning protein family, forms complexes with pro-HB-EGF (15Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 18Mitamura T. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Yomo T. Urabe I. Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), thereby up-regulating the biological activity of pro-HB-EGF by protein-protein interaction (15Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition to CD9, pro-HB-EGF forms a complex with integrin α3β1 (19Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate proteoglycan(s) also binds to the heparin-binding domain of pro-HB-EGF (20Shishido Y. Sharma K.D. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29578-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The fact that the complex composed of pro-HB-EGF, CD9, and integrin α3β1co-localizes at cell-cell contact sites supports the notion that pro-HB-EGF plays a role in intercellular communication in a juxtacrine manner (19Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We previously showed that pro-HB-EGF-expressing cells pretreated with formalin, stimulate cell growth of neighboring cells in a juxtacrine manner (17Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Although these results clearly indicate that pro-HB-EGF itself is a biologically active protein and affects the cell growth of neighboring cells, formalin treatment may modulate the biological functions of pro-HB-EGF. In order to examine the biological activities of pro-HB-EGF under more physiological conditions, we used a co-culture system in which intact cells expressing pro-HB-EGF were incubated with EGFR-expressing cells. The juxtacrine activities of pro-HB-EGF were evaluated by measuring the cell growth of the EGFR-expressing recipient cells. Using this system, we provide evidence of different biological activity of pro-HB-EGF from that of the soluble form. Mouse anti-human EGFR mAb (LA-1) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany).

Murine 32D cells and their derived cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 5% WEHI-3 cell-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 (25Blotnick S.

All cell lines used in this study were determined to be mycoplasma-free. Contamination of mycoplasma would greatly affect the experimental results in the present study. To obtain stable transformants expressing EGFR and EGFR/EpoR chimera, 32D cells were transfected with plasmids containing human EGFR cDNA (pTJNeo-EGFR) (26Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and cDNA of EGFR-EpoR chimera (designated −108, obtained from Dr. A. Yoshimura, Kurume University) (27Iwatsuki K. Endo T. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Matsumoto A. Ohtsubo M. Mori K.J. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8149-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), respectively, by electroporation using the Cell-Porator Electroporation System I (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were cultured in the presence of 600 μg/ml of G418, and clones of G418-resistant cells were isolated. The level of expression of EGFR in the stable transformants was determined by flow cytometry analysis as described below. Cells were allowed to react with anti-human EGFR mAb (LA-1) followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The cells were then analyzed using an EPICS XL Flow Cytometer (Coulter Co., Miami, FL). The scatter window was set to eliminate dead cells and cell debris. For each measurement, 1 × 104 cells were analyzed. Effector cells (Vero cells or Vero-H cells) were placed in tissue culture dishes at a density of 1–2.5 × 104cells/cm2 and cultured in MEM-NEAA containing 10% FCS for 18 h. The cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. Then 1–10 × 104 cells/ml of target cells (DER cells or 32D-derived cell lines) were added to the monolayer, followed by incubation in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. Recombinant EGF (0.3 nm), recombinant HB-EGF (1 nm), or recombinant IL-3 (1.3 pm) was also added to the culture medium. In some cases, Transwell (0.4-mm pore size, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was introduced into the well to separate the recipient cells from the effector cells (Fig. 1). After co-culture for 24–48 h, the rate of DNA synthesis or degree of apoptosis of the target cells was determined. The degree of DNA synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the DNA of the target cells by incubation with [3H]thymidine (74 kBq/ml) for 4 h. Then the target cells were harvested by gentle pipetting, and the radioactivity of the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was measured with a scintillation counter. The degree of apoptosis was measured by three methods. Target cells were harvested by gentle pipetting, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 300 μl of TE-T buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mmEDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, the supernatant was subject to digestion with ribonuclease A (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with proteinase K (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. The sample was then extracted with isopropyl alcohol overnight at −20 °C. The precipitated DNA was resuspended in 20 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.7 or 1.3% agarose gel in the presence of 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Target cells were harvested and analyzed by Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target cells were harvested and analyzed using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The percentage of apoptosis-positive cells was determined by the ratio of the cell number in the second peak of the stronger relative fluorescence intensity to the total cell number (1 × 104), which was set to 100%. In order to study the biological activity of pro-HB-EGF, we employed a co-culture assay in which target cell lines expressing EGFR were incubated with a monolayer of an effector cell line expressing pro-HB-EGF (Fig. 1). Vero-H cells (13Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), stable transformants of Vero cells that express pro-HB-EGF at a level 20 times higher than the parental Vero cells, were used as the effector cell line (Fig.2 a). As target cells, we used the DER cell line, which is a stable transformant of IL-3-dependent 32D cells expressing human EGFR (Fig.2 b). Similar to other 32D-derived cell lines expressing EGFR (30Pierce J.H. Ruggiero M. Fleming T.P. Di-Fiore P.P. Greenberger J.S. Varticovski L. Schelrssinger J. Rovela G. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1988; 239: 628-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), DER cells can grow in a medium containing EGFR ligands without IL-3. Fig. 2 c shows that DNA synthesis in DER cells was maximally promoted by EGF at concentrations over 30 pm or by sHB-EGF at concentrations over 300 pm. DER cells were co-cultured on a monolayer of Vero-H cells or Vero cells in a medium containing 10% FCS. After incubation for 48 h, [3H]thymidine was added to the medium, followed by incubation for 4 h. The DER cells were then separated from the Vero-H cells or Vero cells by gentle pipetting, and the amount of DNA synthesis was determined. Vero-H cells and Vero cells do not detach by this pipetting procedure. Furthermore, under these culture conditions, incorporation of [3H]thymidine into Vero-H cells or Vero cells was negligible; thus, co-culture does not affect the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DER cells. As shown in Fig. 3 a, only a little DNA synthesis was observed in DER cells under these co-culture conditions with the monolayer of Vero cells or Vero-H cells, compared with that of DER cells cultured alone in the presence of 0.3 nm EGF. However, growth of DER cells, monitored by DNA synthesis, was enhanced to a great degree when DER cells were separated from the Vero cells or Vero-H cells by Transwell. Although Vero cells and Vero-H cells express pro-HB-EGF molecules on their cell surface, they also constitutively secrete significant amounts of sHB-EGF into the medium (13Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Therefore, DER cells would be affected by both pro-HB-EGF and sHB-EGF under these co-culture conditions but affected by only sHB-EGF when separated by Transwell. The present results, therefore, imply the possibility that the secreted sHB-EGF in the medium is mitogenic, but the membrane-anchored form (pro-HB-EGF) does not efficiently support DER cell growth in a juxtacrine manner or rather antagonizes the mitogenic activity of sHB-EGF. In order to examine whether pro-HB-EGF exhibits the antagonizing property to the mitogenic activity of soluble EGF receptor ligand, a co-culture assay was carried out in the presence of 0.3 nmof EGF in the culture medium. This concentration of EGF is enough to support DER cell growth (Fig. 2 c). As shown in Fig.3 b, DER cell growth was markedly reduced in the presence of EGF when they were co-cultured with Vero-H cells, as compared with DER cells cultured alone in the same amount of EGF. Co-culture with Vero cells resulted in a slight reduction of DER cell growth. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of Vero-H cells and Vero cells on the growth of DER cells was abrogated when the DER cells were separated from the effector cells by Transwell, indicating that direct contact of DER cells with Vero-H cells is required for inhibitory activity. The higher inhibitory activity seen by co-culture with Vero-H cells than by co-culture with Vero cells, suggests that pro-HB-EGF is involved in this inhibitory activity. To further show that pro-HB-EGF is involved in the inhibitory activity of Vero-H cells, pro-HB-EGF activity was neutralized by CRM197. CRM197, a nontoxic mutant protein of DT (21Uchida T. Pappenheimer Jr., A.M. Greany R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3838-3844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), specifically binds to the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF; thus, CRM197 neutralizes the activity of human HB-EGF but not other EGF ligands (31Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). When CRM197 was added to the medium, it reduced the growth-inhibitory activity of Vero-H cells (Fig. 3 c). CRM197 per se did not affect the rate of DER cell growth (data not shown). These results indicate that pro-HB-EGF is implicated in the inhibitory activity of Vero-H cells. The amount of pro-HB-EGF expressed on the cell surface of Vero-H cells was about 1 × 106 molecules/cell, determined by DT binding. Therefore, the concentration of pro-HB-EGF in the present co-culture conditions is estimated at about 0.03 nm (0.03 pmol/2 × 104 cells/ml). Since the concentration of EGF added to this co-culture assay was 0.3 nm, this suggests that the inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF is unlikely to be due to simple competition with EGF. The growth of DER cells was inhibited by co-culture on the monolayer of Vero-H cells. Since cell death was observed under a microscope in the co-culture of DER cells with Vero-H cells (data not shown), we examined whether apoptosis of DER cells is induced when their growth is inhibited by co-culture on Vero-H cells. Apoptosis was examined by detection of DNA ladder formation (Fig. 4 a). Consistent with cell growth, a DNA ladder was observed in DER cells cultured in the absence of EGF, while a DNA ladder was not observed in DER cells cultured in the presence of EGF. When DER cells were co-cultured for 24 h on Vero-H cells, a DNA ladder was observed in DER cells even in the presence of EGF. CRM197 abrogated such DNA ladder formation of DER cells. A DNA ladder was also observed when DER cells were co-cultured on Vero-H cells in the presence of recombinant HB-EGF instead of EGF. A DNA ladder was not observed when DER cells and Vero-H cells were separated by Transwell. The level of apoptosis was examined more quantitatively by measuring the amount of fragmented nucleosomal complex by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (28Sung K.J. Paik E.M. Jang K.A. Suh H.S. Choi J.H. J. Dermatol. 1997; 24: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 b, the level of apoptosis of DER cells co-cultured on Vero-H cells was reduced by about 60% when DER cells and Vero-H cells were separated with Transwell and by 90% by the addition of CRM197. To examine the percentage of the population of DER cells that undergo apoptosis when co-cultured with Vero-H cells, we also measured the level of apoptosis of DER cells by flow cytometry using the FITC-labeled Annexin V method (29Koupman G. Reutelingsperger C.P.M. Kuijten G.A.M. Keehnen R.M.J. Pals S.T. Oes M.H.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1415-1420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under this assay condition, apoptosis was detected in 50% of DER cells cultured alone for 36 h without any EGFR ligands (data not shown). When DER cells were cultured with 0.3 nm EGF, only 2.5% of the cells were counted as apoptosis-positive (Fig. 4 c). When DER cells were co-cultured with Vero-H cells, more than 15% of DER cells were apoptosis-positive even in the presence of EGF. When the contact of DER cells with Vero-H cells was abrogated by Transwell, the percentage of apoptotic DER cells was reduced to about 6%. When the activity of pro-HB-EGF was inhibited by CRM197 or anti-HB-EGF neutralizing antibody, the percentage of apoptotic DER cells was reduced to less than 6%. Neither CRM197 nor anti-HB-EGF neutralizing antibody per se affected the rate of apoptosis of DER cells (data not shown). These results indicate that pro-HB-EGF, or pro-HB-EGF-expressing Vero cells, have the capability of inducing not only growth inhibition but also apoptosis of DER cells, even in the presence of the soluble form of EGF or sHB-EGF. Pro-HB-EGF-mediated apoptosis was also observed when EGFR-expressing Ba/F3 cells were used as the target cells (data not shown), indicating that the apoptosis is not a specific phenomenon of the 32D cell lines. We have shown that pro-HB-EGF induces apoptosis of DER cells even in the presence of an abundant amount of EGF or sHB-EGF. This inhibitory effect could be explained by the following possibility. Pro-HB-EGF might not have any biological activity, but it might inhibit the mitogenic activity of EGF and sHB-EGF by competitive binding to EGFR. To examine this possibility, we analyzed whether pro-HB-EGF induces apoptosis of DER cells that are cultured in the presence of IL-3. DER cells, derived from IL-3-dependent 32D cells, grow well in the presence of IL-3, and DER cell growth would not be affected by co-culture on Vero-H cells if the inhibitory effect of pro-HB-EGF is due to competitive binding activity. However, this was not the case. Apoptosis of DER cells was induced even in the presence of IL-3 by co-culture with Vero-H cells, although the degree of apoptosis was lower than that in the presence of EGF (Fig.5). CRM197 and anti-EGFR mAb each inhibited apoptosis of DER cells co-cultured on Vero-H cells in the presence of IL-3, indicating that the apoptosis-inducing activity of pro-HB-EGF is not due to simple competition with soluble EGFR ligands to bind to EGFR. Anti-EGFR mAb did not affect the rate of apoptosis of DER cells when used alone (data not shown). Vero-H cells that overexpress pro-HB-EGF inhibit the growth of EGFR-expressing DER cells in a cell contact-dependent manner, and they consequently induce apoptosis of DER cells even in the presence of soluble mitogens. This inhibitory effect was neutralized by anti-HB-EGF antibody and CRM197, indicating that pro-HB-EGF is involved in this inhibitory activity. To examine whether this inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF is mediated to DER cells through EGFR, 32D cells expressing EGFR-EpoR chimeric receptor (32D/EGFR-EpoR) were used as the effector cells instead of DER cells. This chimeric receptor is composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR and the cytoplasmic domain of the erythropoietin receptor. 32D/EGFR-EpoR cells, similar to DER cells, grow well in the presence of EGF or sHB-EGF without IL-3 (data not shown). When 32D/EGFR-EpoR cells were co-cultured with Vero-H cells, their cell growth was not inhibited; thus, apoptosis was not induced (Fig. 6 a). The level of expression of the chimeric receptor on the cell surface was low compared with that of EGFR on DER cells. However, the insusceptibility of 32D/EGFR-EpoR cells is not due to lower expression of the chimeric receptor, since apoptosis was also observed in another 32D cell line expressing EGFR (DER2), which had a much lower number of EGFR than the number of chimeric receptors on 32D/EGFR-EpoR cells (Fig.6 b). Furthermore, when 32D/EGFR-EpoR cells were cultured alone in the absence of EGF or IL-3, apoptosis was observed similar to DER cells and DER2 cells (data not shown). Thus, the difference of the responsiveness of EGFR-expressing 32D cells and the chimeric receptor-expressing 32D cells to apoptotic induction by Vero-H cells would not be due to the difference in level of expression of receptor molecules. A similar result was also observed when EGFR-EpoR-expressing Ba/F3 cells were used as the target cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibitory activity toward cell growth and induction of apoptosis by pro-HB-EGF are transmitted to target cells through their EGFR and that the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR is required for transducing the apoptotic signal. In this study, we have shown that co-culture of EGFR-expressing target cells with pro-HB-EGF-expressing effector cells resulted in growth inhibition and consequent apoptosis in the target cells. Neutralization experiments on the inhibitory activity of Vero-H cells with CRM197 or anti-HB-EGF antibody indicated that pro-HB-EGF is involved in this inhibitory activity. This is also supported by the weak inhibitory activity of Vero cells expressing a lower amount of pro-HB-EGF than Vero-H cells. Moreover, experiments using Transwell indicated that direct contact of effector cells with target cells is required for growth inhibition and apoptosis. From these results, we concluded that pro-HB-EGF is involved in inhibiting the growth of target cells and induces apoptosis in a contact-dependent manner. The results also show that pro-HB-EGF has biological activity that is distinct from that of sHB-EGF. Pro-HB-EGF did not induce apoptosis in 32D cells expressing EGFR-EpoR chimeric receptors. This indicates that the apoptotic activity of pro-HB-EGF-expressing cells is transmitted to the target cells via EGFR and that the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR is required for induction of apoptosis. Although recent reports have shown that HB-EGF binds to HER4 as well as EGFR (HER1) (12Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), at least HER1 is implicated in this inhibitory response. Both direct contact of the target cells with pro-HB-EGF-expressing cells and expression of EGFR with intact cytoplasmic domain on the surface of the target cells were required for induction of apoptosis of the target cells. This suggests that direct interaction between pro-HB-EGF and EGFR in a juxtacrine manner is necessary for the inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF. Pro-HB-EGF-expressing effector cells inhibit the cell growth of target cells. However, it has not been clear whether this growth inhibition and apoptosis are due to innate activity of pro-HB-EGF itself or a secondary effect induced by pro-HB-EGF. In either case, however, it should be emphasized that interaction of pro-HB-EGF with EGFR is the initial trigger for growth inhibition and apoptosis. In addition, the present study does not discriminate between growth inhibition and apoptosis. The cell lines used in our study are of 32D or Ba/F3 origin, which are both IL-3-dependent. Apoptosis was concomitant with growth inhibition in these cells when cultured without IL-3 or EGFR ligands. Thus, it is difficult to determine whether pro-HB-EGF induces growth inhibition, which consequently causes apoptosis, or if pro-HB-EGF generates a direct apoptotic signal. As shown in this study, EGF and sHB-EGF stimulate the growth of DER cells, while pro-HB-EGF inhibits their growth even in the presence of EGF or sHB-EGF. Why do two forms of HB-EGF, the soluble form and membrane-anchored form, exhibit opposite biological effects? One possible explanation might be that pro-HB-EGF is a mitogenically inactive molecule but that it inhibits the mitogenic activity of EGF and sHB-EGF by competitive binding to EGFR. However, this possibility is denied by the following results: 1) growth inhibition and apoptosis of target cells were observed in the presence of a sufficient amount of EGF (300 pm), while the concentration of pro-HB-EGF molecule in the co-culture conditions with Vero-H cells is estimated to be about 30 pm; 2) apoptosis of target cells was also observed in the presence of IL-3, which transduces mitogenic signal to the target cells in an EGFR-independent manner; and 3) apoptosis induced by the co-culture with Vero-H cells was strongly reduced in target cells expressing EGFR mutant (EGFR-EpoR), although the EGFR mutant binds to HB-EGF. The addition of EGF to the culture medium of A431 cells, a cell line that naturally overexpresses EGFR, causes growth inhibition (32Gill G.N. Lazar C.S. Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is plausible that a too strong signal generated by EGFR causes growth inhibition of cells. In fact, constitutive and strong induction of Ras, Raf or mitogen-activated protein kinase can lead to apoptosis (33Chen C.Y. Faller D.V. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1487-1498PubMed Google Scholar, 34El-Ashry D. Miller D.L. Kharbanda S. Lippman M.E. Kern F.G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35Fukasawa K. Rulong S. Resau J. Pinto da Silva P. Vande Woude G.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). The target cells used in this study also express a large amount of EGFR. Therefore, we can assume that the binding of pro-HB-EGF to EGFR causes constitutive activation and/or hyper-activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling molecules. However, neither constitutive phosphorylation nor hyperphosphorylation of EGFR was observed in DER cells co-cultured with Vero-H cells (data not shown). In addition to EGFR phosphorylation, activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was also examined by using the specific antibody to phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase. However, significant activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was not observed (data not shown). Thus, pro-HB-EGF-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis cannot be explained by hyperactivation of EGFR. A more plausible explanation for pro-HB-EGF-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis is that interaction of EGFR with pro-HB-EGF may generate a downstream signal linked to growth inhibition and apoptosis. As shown here, pro-HB-EGF-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis were not seen in 32D cells expressing EGFR/EpoR chimeric receptor, despite the fact that these cells can grow well in the presence of EGF. These suggest a requirement of the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR for the inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF and support the notion that a qualitatively different signal is generated from EGFR by interaction with pro-HB-EGF. What differences in the molecular nature of pro-HB-EGF and sHB-EGF are responsible for inducing an opposite biological response in EGFR-expressing cells? The importance of the clustering of membrane-anchored ligands has generally been suggested. In the case of the B type of ephrin, the secreted form has no function, but clustering of the soluble form by antibody makes it active (8Davis S. Gale N.W. Aldrich T.H. Maisonpierre P.C. Lhotak V. Pawson T. Goldfarb M. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 266: 816-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that dimerization of the membrane-anchored c-Kit ligand is important for its activity (36Tajima Y. Huang E.J. Vosseler K. Ono M. Moor M.A.S. Besmer P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1451-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Analogous to these previous findings, we hypothetically propose the formation of a homodimer or homooligomer of pro-HB-EGF molecules. Pro-HB-EGF-associating CD9 (15Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), integrin α3β1 (19Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (20Shishido Y. Sharma K.D. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29578-29585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) may induce this oligomer formation. Oligomerized pro-HB-EGF molecules on the cell surface may result in oligomerization of EGFR, which may lead to recruitment of signaling molecules involved in growth inhibition and apoptosis to EGFR in EGFR-expressing cells. We previously reported that pro-HB-EGF on formalin-fixed cells has mitogenic activity similar to sHB-EGF (17Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this is perturbation of oligomer formation of pro-HB-EGF molecules by fixation with formalin. The growth-inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF may be helpful for maintaining cultured cells in saturation-dependent growth arrest. Vero cells and Vero-H cells, which we used as effector cells, express EGFR as well as pro-HB-EGF, and both pro-HB-EGF and EGFR localize at cell-cell contact sites (19Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). When these cell cultures reach confluent states, the proliferation of these cells stops or decreases, as seen in cultures of many other types of cells. Even at the confluent stage, pro-HB-EGF and EGFR are expressed in these cells and localize at cell-cell contact sites. Thus, it would be possible to transmit a growth-inhibitory signal to a neighboring cell by virtue of pro-HB-EGF. Vero-H cells express pro-HB-EGF at a level about 20 times higher than Vero cells, and Vero-H cells show higher growth-inhibitory activity to EGFR-expressing target cells, as shown in this paper. We have found that the saturation density of Vero-H cells is lower than that of the parental Vero cells, 2R. Iwamoto, K. Handa, and E. Mekada, unpublished observation.consistent with the notion that pro-HB-EGF is involved in arresting the growth of confluent cells. It has also been reported that hepatoma cells transfected with the construct expressing pro-HB-EGF, proliferate slower than the same cells transfected with the construct expressing only sHB-EGF (37Miyoshi E. Higashiyama S. Nakagawa T. Hayashi N. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14349-14355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the growth-inhibitory activity of pro-HB-EGF may partly fill the role of the growth arrest mechanism seen in confluent cells or in so-called “contact inhibition” state.

Akihiko Yoshimura (Kurume University, Kurume) and Masabumi Shibuya (University of Tokyo, Tokyo) for kind gifts of EGFR-EpoR chimeric receptor cDNA and EGFR cDNA, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2324806349,"We have previously shown that expression of the papillomavirus E2 protein in HeLa cells induces p53 accumulation and causes both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast to growth arrest, onset of apoptosis was not correlated with an increase of p53 transcriptional activity. In the present study, we conducted biochemical and genetic experiments in order to determine whether E2-induced apoptosis was independent of p53 induction. We showed that E2 did not alter the transcription of Bax, a known p53-activated cell death inducer. The time course of apoptotic cell death preceded p53 induction by several hours. Overexpression of the HPV18 E6 oncogene prevented E2-mediated p53 accumulation, but did not alter the rate of cell death. Finally, point mutants of the HPV18 E2 transactivation domain induced apoptosis, although they were unable to induce high p53 accumulation or cell cycle arrest. In addition, the results obtained with these mutants indicated that both transcriptional activation and replication functions of E2 were dispensable for the induction of cell death. These observations show that E2-induced apoptosis is an early event, independent of p53 accumulation and unrelated to downstream p53-dependent transcriptional events."
https://openalex.org/W2153868739,"It has been proposed that in rat and murine tissues glucosidase II (GII) is formed by two subunits, GIIα and GIIβ, respectively, responsible for the catalytic activity and the retention of the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

The oligosaccharide transferred from the dolichol-P-P-derivative to Asn residues in nascent polypeptide chains (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is first deglucosylated by glucosidase I (GI), which removes the more external glucose unit, and then by glucosidase II (GII), which excises both remaining glucose units. The UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) then transfers a single glucose unit to glucose-free oligosaccharides (1Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). According to the model proposed for the quality control of glycoprotein folding in mammalian cells, monoglucosylated oligosaccharides formed either by partial deglucosylation of the transferred compound or by GT-mediated reglucosylation are recognized by two ER lectins, membrane-bound calnexin or its soluble homolog calreticulin (3Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Further deglucosylation of the oligosaccharides by GII liberates the glycoproteins from their lectin anchors. The oligosaccharides are then reglucosylated by GT and thus recognized again by the lectins, only when linked to misfolded protein moieties as it has been found that GT only glucosylates glycoproteins not displaying their proper tertiary structures (2Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Sousa M. Ferrero-García M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The deglucosylation-reglucosylation cycle continues until proper glycoprotein folding is achieved.The calnexin/calreticulin-monoglucosylated glycoprotein interaction was called quality control of glycoprotein folding as it was found to be one of the several existing alternative mechanisms by which cells retain misfolded species in the ER and eventually transport them to the cytosol where they are degraded in the proteasomes (5Zhang J.-X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E.S. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, the above mentioned interaction facilitates glycoprotein folding by preventing aggregation and formation of non-native disulfide bonds (6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,7Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a result of this interaction, a decrease in glycoprotein folding rate but an increase in folding efficiency were observed (6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).All evidence for the proposed mechanism of quality control of glycoprotein folding was derived from experiments performed in mammalian cell systems (3Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), but presumably a similar mechanism is operative in Schizosaccharomyces pombe as this yeast expresses a GT activity and a calnexin homolog (8Fernández F.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3064-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the oligosaccharide transferred to nascent polypeptides in S. pombe is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the same as in most eukaryotic cells, and that this compound is processed in the ER to Man9GlcNAc2, thus indicating the presence of both GI and GII activities (12Ziegler F.D. Gemmil T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 12527-12535Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have recently reported that GT-mediated formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides is essential for S. pombe viability under conditions of severe ER stress such as underglycosylation of glycoproteins caused by the alg6 mutation and high temperature (Man9GlcNAc2 and not Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is transferred in alg6 mutants) (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was proposed that folding of a glycoprotein involved in cell wall formation was affected in gpt1/alg6 double mutants as the wild type phenotype could be restored not only upon transfection with a GT-encoding expression vector but also in a hyperosmotic growth medium (1 msorbitol). No evidence was presented, however, indicating that monoglucosylated oligosaccharides actually facilitated glycoprotein folding in this yeast.Purification of GII from rat and murine tissues yielded two tightly bound polypeptides (named GIIα and GIIβ) that could not be separated by procedures commonly used for enzyme purification without loss of the enzymatic activity. Subunit GIIα (a 104-kDa soluble protein) had a certain homology to other glucosidases and no ER retrieval signal at its C terminus, whereas this last feature was found in subunit GIIβ, a 58-kDa soluble polypeptide with no sequence similarity to other proteins (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It was proposed that GIIα was GII catalytic subunit, whereas GIIβ was responsible for its ER retention, but no actual evidence for this proposal was presented. The proposal remained controversial, however, as no such dimeric structure was found in GII purified from pig liver and kidney and from plant tissues (16Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol.

Moreover, although a GIIα homolog devoid of an ER retrieval sequence is encoded in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, no protein with significant homology to GIIβ and having an ER retrieval sequence at its C terminus is encoded in the DNA of this budding yeast (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).The purpose of work reported here is to present genetic support for the proposed heterodimeric structure of GII as well as for the occurrence of monoglucosylated oligosaccharide-mediated glycoprotein folding facilitation in low eukaryote cells.DISCUSSIONAs mentioned above, it has been proposed that GII is a heterodimer composed by catalytic (GIIα) and ER retention (GIIβ) subunits (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This proposal remained controversial as such structure was detected in mouse T-lymphoma cell and rat liver enzyme preparations but not in GII purified to homogeneity from plants and pig liver and kidney (16Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16271-16279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Flura T. Brada D. Ziak M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, although the GIIα homolog in S. cerevisiae also lacks an ER retrieval sequence and shows significant similarity to its mammalian counterpart, no protein with significant homology to GIIβ and having an ER retrieval sequence was found in the budding yeast genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The possibility exists, therefore, that the heterodimeric structure could be restricted to mouse and rat tissues or, alternatively, that it could be an artifact created during enzyme purification.We herein present genetic evidence for the heterodimeric structure of GII. Genes coding for either GIIα or GIIβ homologs in S. pombe were disrupted, and no GII activity was detected in in vitro assays performed with microsomal fractions isolated from the respective mutants. On the other hand, GI activity in both mutant microsomal fractions had levels similar to those found in wild type cells. Despite the total absence of GII activity revealed by in vitro assays, structural analysis of protein-linked oligosaccharides synthesized in intact wild type and mutant cells pulsed with [14C]glucose confirmed that GIIα is indeed responsible for catalysis and GIIβ for GIIα ER retention; although Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc2Man8GlcNAc2 were the only compounds synthesized in the gls2α mutant, formation of small amounts of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2was detected in gls2β cells. It may be speculated that the latter compound was formed by gls2αp transiently present in the ER before secretion. The notion that gls2αp (GIIα) is the catalytic subunit agrees with the fact that it shows significant similarity to the so-called family 31 and 9 glucosidases (27Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Although GIIβ displays an ER retrieval sequence (VDEL) and as such its primary role is probably that of retaining GIIα in the ER, it cannot be discarded that it might also contribute to the stability of the latter subunit. It is worth mentioning that a GIIβ homolog has been detected also in the human genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This fact as well as results presented in the present report strongly suggest that GII is a heterodimer in most if not all eukaryotic cells. The presence of ER-retaining subunits has been already described for prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the triglyceride transfer proteins that lack ER retrieval signals (28Pihlahaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanem K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 29Gordon D. Wetterau J. Gregg R. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In both cases the retaining protein (protein disulfide isomerase) is essential for cell viability, thus precluding confirmation of its retaining role by gene disruption.Retention of two glucose units in protein-linked oligosaccharides is not expected to cause misfolding of glycoproteins per se as it has been determined that oligosaccharides are mainly processed in S. pombe ER to Man9GlcNAc2 and that the tertiary structure of this compound is identical whether it has one, two, or no glucoses (12Ziegler F.D. Gemmil T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 12527-12535Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Petrescu A.J. Butters T.D. Reinkensmeier G. Petrescu S. Platt F.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, GIIα and GIIβ are minor lumenal ER proteins, so their absence is not expected to trigger the unfolded protein response for unspecific reasons. Nevertheless, gls2α and gls2β mutant cells grown in the absence of exogenous stress accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER as judged by the induction of BiP-encoding mRNA. That misfolding of glycoproteins (and therefore BiP induction) in gls2α and gls2β mutants was not caused by a deleterious effect of the two retained glucoses on the tertiary structure of the protein moieties but by a deficiency in the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides was also indicated by the fact that the unfolded protein response was observed in gpt1 mutants, that is in cells that lacked GT-mediated reglucosylation. No diglucosylated oligosaccharides accumulated in those mutant cells. Induction of BiP-encoding mRNA in the absence of exogenous stress was shown to occur also in GII-defective mammalian cells (31Balow J.P. Weissman J.D. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29025-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be concluded that BiP mRNA induction in the latter cells was an exclusive consequence of the lack of GII because those mutants had been obtained by selecting cells resistant to Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin after treatment with chemical mutagens (32Reitman M.L. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10357-10363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Trowbridge I.S. Hyman R. Ferson T. Mazauskas C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1978; 8: 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). On the contrary, Southern blotting analysis of all mutants employed in the present report (gls2α, gls2β, and gpt1) showed that the marker gene employed (ura4 +) had always only disrupted the intended target. Misfolding glycoproteins in cells deficient in monoglucosylated oligosaccharide formation was also revealed by the much higher proportion of ER-specific, protein-linked oligosaccharides detected in gls2α and gpt1 mutants when compared with wild type cells.Formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides decreased the folding rate but increased the folding efficiency in S. pombe, the same as in mammalian cells, because monitoring of CPY processing indicated that this glycoprotein arrived early but in diminished amounts to the vacuoles of gls2α than to those of wild type cells. This result and the already mentioned accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER of cells grown under non-stressed conditions but having impaired formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides confirm that those compounds are indeed involved in glycoprotein folding facilitation in S. pombe. The absence of a discernible phenotype in gls2α, gls2β, and gpt1 cells may be explained by the up-regulation of BiP and probably of other chaperones and folding-assisting proteins that compensate for the null or lower amount of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides formed. As mentioned above, only under extreme stress conditions (glycoprotein underglycosylation and high temperature) the formation of monoglucosylated glycoproteins was found to be required for S. pombe viability (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).No induction of BiP mRNA was observed in S. cerevisiae GII-deficient mutants grown under non-stressed conditions (34Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 35Simons J.F. Ebersold M. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 396-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This result, as well as the absence of GT, the sensor of misfolded protein conformations, from those cells and the existence of a calnexin homolog with striking structural variations in the domain that recognizes monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (P-domain) (8Fernández F. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jakob C.A. Burda P. te Heesen S. Aebi M. Roth J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 244-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) casts doubts on the occurrence of a quality control mechanism of glycoprotein folding in S. cerevisiae similar to that described for mammalian cells. Glucosidase II (GII)1plays a pivotal role in the processing of N-oligosaccharides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The oligosaccharide transferred from the dolichol-P-P-derivative to Asn residues in nascent polypeptide chains (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is first deglucosylated by glucosidase I (GI), which removes the more external glucose unit, and then by glucosidase II (GII), which excises both remaining glucose units. The UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) then transfers a single glucose unit to glucose-free oligosaccharides (1Parodi A.J. Mendelzon D.H. Lederkremer G.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8260-8265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). According to the model proposed for the quality control of glycoprotein folding in mammalian cells, monoglucosylated oligosaccharides formed either by partial deglucosylation of the transferred compound or by GT-mediated reglucosylation are recognized by two ER lectins, membrane-bound calnexin or its soluble homolog calreticulin (3Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Further deglucosylation of the oligosaccharides by GII liberates the glycoproteins from their lectin anchors. The oligosaccharides are then reglucosylated by GT and thus recognized again by the lectins, only when linked to misfolded protein moieties as it has been found that GT only glucosylates glycoproteins not displaying their proper tertiary structures (2Trombetta S. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Sousa M. Ferrero-García M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The deglucosylation-reglucosylation cycle continues until proper glycoprotein folding is achieved. The calnexin/calreticulin-monoglucosylated glycoprotein interaction was called quality control of glycoprotein folding as it was found to be one of the several existing alternative mechanisms by which cells retain misfolded species in the ER and eventually transport them to the cytosol where they are degraded in the proteasomes (5Zhang J.-X. Braakman I. Matlack K.E.S. Helenius A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1943-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In addition, the above mentioned interaction facilitates glycoprotein folding by preventing aggregation and formation of non-native disulfide bonds (6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,7Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). As a result of this interaction, a decrease in glycoprotein folding rate but an increase in folding efficiency were observed (6Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). All evidence for the proposed mechanism of quality control of glycoprotein folding was derived from experiments performed in mammalian cell systems (3Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), but presumably a similar mechanism is operative in Schizosaccharomyces pombe as this yeast expresses a GT activity and a calnexin homolog (8Fernández F. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Fernández F. Jannatipour M. Hellman U. Rokeach L. Parodi A.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3064-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the oligosaccharide transferred to nascent polypeptides in S. pombe is Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, the same as in most eukaryotic cells, and that this compound is processed in the ER to Man9GlcNAc2, thus indicating the presence of both GI and GII activities (12Ziegler F.D. Gemmil T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 12527-12535Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have recently reported that GT-mediated formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides is essential for S. pombe viability under conditions of severe ER stress such as underglycosylation of glycoproteins caused by the alg6 mutation and high temperature (Man9GlcNAc2 and not Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 is transferred in alg6 mutants) (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was proposed that folding of a glycoprotein involved in cell wall formation was affected in gpt1/alg6 double mutants as the wild type phenotype could be restored not only upon transfection with a GT-encoding expression vector but also in a hyperosmotic growth medium (1 msorbitol). No evidence was presented, however, indicating that monoglucosylated oligosaccharides actually facilitated glycoprotein folding in this yeast. Purification of GII from rat and murine tissues yielded two tightly bound polypeptides (named GIIα and GIIβ) that could not be separated by procedures commonly used for enzyme purification without loss of the enzymatic activity. Subunit GIIα (a 104-kDa soluble protein) had a certain homology to other glucosidases and no ER retrieval signal at its C terminus, whereas this last feature was found in subunit GIIβ, a 58-kDa soluble polypeptide with no sequence similarity to other proteins (14Trombetta E.S.

It was proposed that GIIα was GII catalytic subunit, whereas GIIβ was responsible for its ER retention, but no actual evidence for this proposal was presented. The proposal remained controversial, however, as no such dimeric structure was found in GII purified from pig liver and kidney and from plant tissues (16Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J.

Moreover, although a GIIα homolog devoid of an ER retrieval sequence is encoded in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome, no protein with significant homology to GIIβ and having an ER retrieval sequence at its C terminus is encoded in the DNA of this budding yeast (14Trombetta E.S.

The purpose of work reported here is to present genetic support for the proposed heterodimeric structure of GII as well as for the occurrence of monoglucosylated oligosaccharide-mediated glycoprotein folding facilitation in low eukaryote cells. DISCUSSIONAs mentioned above, it has been proposed that GII is a heterodimer composed by catalytic (GIIα) and ER retention (GIIβ) subunits (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This proposal remained controversial as such structure was detected in mouse T-lymphoma cell and rat liver enzyme preparations but not in GII purified to homogeneity from plants and pig liver and kidney (16Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol.

In addition, although the GIIα homolog in S. cerevisiae also lacks an ER retrieval sequence and shows significant similarity to its mammalian counterpart, no protein with significant homology to GIIβ and having an ER retrieval sequence was found in the budding yeast genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The possibility exists, therefore, that the heterodimeric structure could be restricted to mouse and rat tissues or, alternatively, that it could be an artifact created during enzyme purification.We herein present genetic evidence for the heterodimeric structure of GII. Genes coding for either GIIα or GIIβ homologs in S. pombe were disrupted, and no GII activity was detected in in vitro assays performed with microsomal fractions isolated from the respective mutants. On the other hand, GI activity in both mutant microsomal fractions had levels similar to those found in wild type cells. Despite the total absence of GII activity revealed by in vitro assays, structural analysis of protein-linked oligosaccharides synthesized in intact wild type and mutant cells pulsed with [14C]glucose confirmed that GIIα is indeed responsible for catalysis and GIIβ for GIIα ER retention; although Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc2Man8GlcNAc2 were the only compounds synthesized in the gls2α mutant, formation of small amounts of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2was detected in gls2β cells. It may be speculated that the latter compound was formed by gls2αp transiently present in the ER before secretion. The notion that gls2αp (GIIα) is the catalytic subunit agrees with the fact that it shows significant similarity to the so-called family 31 and 9 glucosidases (27Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Although GIIβ displays an ER retrieval sequence (VDEL) and as such its primary role is probably that of retaining GIIα in the ER, it cannot be discarded that it might also contribute to the stability of the latter subunit. It is worth mentioning that a GIIβ homolog has been detected also in the human genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This fact as well as results presented in the present report strongly suggest that GII is a heterodimer in most if not all eukaryotic cells. The presence of ER-retaining subunits has been already described for prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the triglyceride transfer proteins that lack ER retrieval signals (28Pihlahaniemi T. Helaakoski T.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In both cases the retaining protein (protein disulfide isomerase) is essential for cell viability, thus precluding confirmation of its retaining role by gene disruption.Retention of two glucose units in protein-linked oligosaccharides is not expected to cause misfolding of glycoproteins per se as it has been determined that oligosaccharides are mainly processed in S. pombe ER to Man9GlcNAc2 and that the tertiary structure of this compound is identical whether it has one, two, or no glucoses (12Ziegler F.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, GIIα and GIIβ are minor lumenal ER proteins, so their absence is not expected to trigger the unfolded protein response for unspecific reasons. Nevertheless, gls2α and gls2β mutant cells grown in the absence of exogenous stress accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER as judged by the induction of BiP-encoding mRNA. That misfolding of glycoproteins (and therefore BiP induction) in gls2α and gls2β mutants was not caused by a deleterious effect of the two retained glucoses on the tertiary structure of the protein moieties but by a deficiency in the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides was also indicated by the fact that the unfolded protein response was observed in gpt1 mutants, that is in cells that lacked GT-mediated reglucosylation. No diglucosylated oligosaccharides accumulated in those mutant cells. Induction of BiP-encoding mRNA in the absence of exogenous stress was shown to occur also in GII-defective mammalian cells (31Balow J.P. Weissman J.D. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29025-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be concluded that BiP mRNA induction in the latter cells was an exclusive consequence of the lack of GII because those mutants had been obtained by selecting cells resistant to Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin after treatment with chemical mutagens (32Reitman M.L.

On the contrary, Southern blotting analysis of all mutants employed in the present report (gls2α, gls2β, and gpt1) showed that the marker gene employed (ura4 +) had always only disrupted the intended target. Misfolding glycoproteins in cells deficient in monoglucosylated oligosaccharide formation was also revealed by the much higher proportion of ER-specific, protein-linked oligosaccharides detected in gls2α and gpt1 mutants when compared with wild type cells.Formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides decreased the folding rate but increased the folding efficiency in S. pombe, the same as in mammalian cells, because monitoring of CPY processing indicated that this glycoprotein arrived early but in diminished amounts to the vacuoles of gls2α than to those of wild type cells. This result and the already mentioned accumulation of misfolded glycoproteins in the ER of cells grown under non-stressed conditions but having impaired formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides confirm that those compounds are indeed involved in glycoprotein folding facilitation in S. pombe. The absence of a discernible phenotype in gls2α, gls2β, and gpt1 cells may be explained by the up-regulation of BiP and probably of other chaperones and folding-assisting proteins that compensate for the null or lower amount of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides formed. As mentioned above, only under extreme stress conditions (glycoprotein underglycosylation and high temperature) the formation of monoglucosylated glycoproteins was found to be required for S. pombe viability (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).No induction of BiP mRNA was observed in S. cerevisiae GII-deficient mutants grown under non-stressed conditions (34Jakob C.A.

This result, as well as the absence of GT, the sensor of misfolded protein conformations, from those cells and the existence of a calnexin homolog with striking structural variations in the domain that recognizes monoglucosylated oligosaccharides (P-domain) (8Fernández F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 244-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) casts doubts on the occurrence of a quality control mechanism of glycoprotein folding in S. cerevisiae similar to that described for mammalian cells. As mentioned above, it has been proposed that GII is a heterodimer composed by catalytic (GIIα) and ER retention (GIIβ) subunits (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar,15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This proposal remained controversial as such structure was detected in mouse T-lymphoma cell and rat liver enzyme preparations but not in GII purified to homogeneity from plants and pig liver and kidney (16Brada D. Dubach U.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Kaushal G.P. Pastuszak I. Hatanaka K. Elbein A.D. J. Biol.

In addition, although the GIIα homolog in S. cerevisiae also lacks an ER retrieval sequence and shows significant similarity to its mammalian counterpart, no protein with significant homology to GIIβ and having an ER retrieval sequence was found in the budding yeast genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The possibility exists, therefore, that the heterodimeric structure could be restricted to mouse and rat tissues or, alternatively, that it could be an artifact created during enzyme purification. We herein present genetic evidence for the heterodimeric structure of GII. Genes coding for either GIIα or GIIβ homologs in S. pombe were disrupted, and no GII activity was detected in in vitro assays performed with microsomal fractions isolated from the respective mutants. On the other hand, GI activity in both mutant microsomal fractions had levels similar to those found in wild type cells. Despite the total absence of GII activity revealed by in vitro assays, structural analysis of protein-linked oligosaccharides synthesized in intact wild type and mutant cells pulsed with [14C]glucose confirmed that GIIα is indeed responsible for catalysis and GIIβ for GIIα ER retention; although Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and Glc2Man8GlcNAc2 were the only compounds synthesized in the gls2α mutant, formation of small amounts of Glc1Man9GlcNAc2was detected in gls2β cells. It may be speculated that the latter compound was formed by gls2αp transiently present in the ER before secretion. The notion that gls2αp (GIIα) is the catalytic subunit agrees with the fact that it shows significant similarity to the so-called family 31 and 9 glucosidases (27Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). Although GIIβ displays an ER retrieval sequence (VDEL) and as such its primary role is probably that of retaining GIIα in the ER, it cannot be discarded that it might also contribute to the stability of the latter subunit. It is worth mentioning that a GIIβ homolog has been detected also in the human genome (14Trombetta E.S. Simons J.F. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27509-27516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Arendt C.W. Ostergaard H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13117-13125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This fact as well as results presented in the present report strongly suggest that GII is a heterodimer in most if not all eukaryotic cells. The presence of ER-retaining subunits has been already described for prolyl 4-hydroxylase and the triglyceride transfer proteins that lack ER retrieval signals (28Pihlahaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanem K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.L. Koivu J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 29Gordon D. Wetterau J. Gregg R. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 317-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In both cases the retaining protein (protein disulfide isomerase) is essential for cell viability, thus precluding confirmation of its retaining role by gene disruption. Retention of two glucose units in protein-linked oligosaccharides is not expected to cause misfolding of glycoproteins per se as it has been determined that oligosaccharides are mainly processed in S. pombe ER to Man9GlcNAc2 and that the tertiary structure of this compound is identical whether it has one, two, or no glucoses (12Ziegler F.D. Gemmil T.R. Trimble R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 268: 12527-12535Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 30Petrescu A.J. Butters T.D. Reinkensmeier G. Petrescu S. Platt F.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition, GIIα and GIIβ are minor lumenal ER proteins, so their absence is not expected to trigger the unfolded protein response for unspecific reasons. Nevertheless, gls2α and gls2β mutant cells grown in the absence of exogenous stress accumulated misfolded proteins in the ER as judged by the induction of BiP-encoding mRNA. That misfolding of glycoproteins (and therefore BiP induction) in gls2α and gls2β mutants was not caused by a deleterious effect of the two retained glucoses on the tertiary structure of the protein moieties but by a deficiency in the formation of monoglucosylated oligosaccharides was also indicated by the fact that the unfolded protein response was observed in gpt1 mutants, that is in cells that lacked GT-mediated reglucosylation. No diglucosylated oligosaccharides accumulated in those mutant cells. Induction of BiP-encoding mRNA in the absence of exogenous stress was shown to occur also in GII-defective mammalian cells (31Balow J.P. Weissman J.D. Kearse K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29025-29029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be concluded that BiP mRNA induction in the latter cells was an exclusive consequence of the lack of GII because those mutants had been obtained by selecting cells resistant to Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin after treatment with chemical mutagens (32Reitman M.L. Trowbridge I.S. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10357-10363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Trowbridge I.S. Hyman R. Ferson T. Mazauskas C. Eur. J.

This process depends on one tyrosine of the IL-9 receptor, which is necessary for proliferation, gene induction, and inhibition of apoptosis induced by glucocorticoids. By introduction of point mutations in amino acids surrounding this tyrosine, we obtained receptors that activated either STAT5 alone or both STAT1 and STAT3, thus providing us with the possibility to study the respective roles of these factors in the biological activities of IL-9. Both mutant receptors were able to prevent apoptosis, but only the mutant that activated STAT1 and STAT3 was able to support induction of granzyme A and L-selectin. In line with these results, constitutively activated STAT5 blocked glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. In Ba/F3 cells, significant proliferation and pim-1 induction were observed with both STAT-restricted mutants, though proliferation was lower than with the wild-type receptor. These results suggest that survival and cell growth are redundantly controlled by multiple STAT factors, whereas differentiation gene induction is more specifically correlated with individual STAT activation by IL-9.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). IL-9 interacts with a complex composed of the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) and the IL-2 receptor γ-chain. Other cytokines using the IL-2 receptor γ-chain, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (10Demoulin J.-B. Renauld J.-C. Cytokines Cell. Mol. Ther. 1998; 4: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar), share some activities with IL-9 such as T cell proliferation in vitro and inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Yet, IL-9 specifically induces the expression of several genes, such as Ly-6A/E, granzymes, and mast cell-specific genes, which are not regulated by IL-2.We recently showed that these effects are mediated by the JAK (Janus kinase)-STAT (signaltransducer and activator oftranscription) pathway (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). IL-9 activates two JAK tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, pre-associated with IL-9R and the IL-2 receptor γ-chain, respectively (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D.

Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases are responsible for the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 transcription factors by IL-9 (11Demoulin J.-B.

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). For instance, the phospho-Tyr-Glu-XX-His sequence in the IFN-γ receptor interacts specifically with STAT1 (16Greenlund A.C. Farrar M. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and phospho-Tyr-XX-Gln motifs in gp130 do so with STAT3 (17Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). A second factor controlling specificity lies in the DNA sequences recognized by each STAT complex, as shown by EMSA in vitro analysis (18Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Rothman P. Kreider B. Azam M. Levy D. Wegenka U. Eilers A. Decker T. Horn F. Kashleva H. Ihle J. Schindler C. Immunity. 1994; 1: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, STAT5 binds to the β-casein promoter element (βCAS) required for the control of this gene by prolactin (20Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other DNA sequences, such as GRR, a Fcγ receptor type I promoter motif responsible for regulation by IFN-γ, bind to most STAT factors (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Lin J.-X. Migone T.-S. Tsang M. Friedmann M.

However, it is not known if the Fcγ receptor type I gene can be regulated in vivo via all these STAT proteins. More generally, specificity in the regulation of gene expression by different STAT proteins has been studied only to a limited extent (22Leonard W. O'Shea J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar).Activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 by IL-9 depends on a single phosphotyrosine at position 367 in IL-9R. This amino acid is also required for gene induction, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis inhibition by IL-9 (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Bauer J. Liu K. You Y. Lai S. Goldsmith M. J. Biol.

The aim of this work was to discriminate between the respective roles of each STAT in IL-9 signaling by mutating amino acids surrounding IL-9R tyrosine 367. Our data point to a specific role for STAT1 and STAT3 in differentiation gene induction. By contrast, protection against apoptosis and proliferation was observed in mutants activating either STAT5 or both STAT1 and STAT3, suggesting redundancy in these cases.DISCUSSIONActivation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 by IL-9 depends on a single phosphorylated tyrosine of IL-9R (tyrosine 367). Here, we show that distinct amino acids surrounding tyrosine 367 are involved in the activation of these factors: full STAT1 activation required proline 369 and glutamine 370; STAT3 required glutamine 370; and STAT5 required leucine 368, in line with proposed consensus sequences (11Demoulin J.-B.

The results are summarized in Table I. We first showed that induction of differentiation genes such as granzyme A, Ly-6A/E, and L-selectin could be mediated by STAT1 alone, although STAT3 (but not STAT5) may also be involved. Granzyme A has been identified as a gene induced by IL-9 (but not by IL-2) in the TS2 T cell clone (25Louahed J. Kermouni A. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5061-5070PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, IL-9 activates the same STAT proteins as in BW5147 cells, whereas IL-2 activates only STAT5.2 Thus, our data suggest that specific gene induction in this model could be due to a distinct STAT activation pattern. Moreover, IFN-γ and IL-6, cytokines that activated only STAT1 or both STAT1 and STAT3, also induced the expression of granzyme A and Ly-6A/E in BW5147 cells. Further analysis of the STAT-binding site in the Ly-6A/E promoter indicated that differences in DNA-binding properties of the different STAT proteins account for specific gene induction. Analysis of mice deficient in STAT1 and/or STAT3 should further establish the role of these STAT proteins in gene induction by IL-9.Table ISTAT1, STAT3, and/or STAT5 activation: correlation with IL-9 activitiesCytokine/receptorActivated STATGranzyme A Ly-6A2L-selectinpim-1ProliferationApoptosis inhibitionIL-9/wild-type1, 3, 5++++++IL-9/mut1−−−−−IL-9/mut61, 3++++++IL-9/mut75−−+++IL-9/mut9(1), 3, 5+ND1-aND, not determined.ND+++IFN-γ1++1-bIFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26, 36).−IL-6(1), 3++1-bIFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26, 36).+IL-35−+++IL-251-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).2+1-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).2+1-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).21-a ND, not determined.1-b IFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26Yip-Scheider M.

The role of this kinase in IL-9 signaling has to be further analyzed, particularly in hematopoietic cells, where pim-1 is predominantly expressed (36Lilly M. Le T. Holland P. Hendrickson S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 727-732PubMed Google Scholar). IL-3 also induced pim-1 expression, as described by Mui et al. (34Mui A. Wakao H. Kinoshita T. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2425-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a role for STAT5 in this process. Accordingly, pim-1 induction by IL-9 could be mediated by STAT5 alone, but also by STAT1 and/or STAT3. Noticeably, IFN-γ has been shown to regulate this gene via the binding of STAT1 on a GAS promoter element (26Yip-Scheider M. Horie M. Broxmeyer H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicated that STAT3 and STAT5 are also able to bind to this GAS, which most likely participates in pim-1 regulation by IL-9 and IL-3. Interestingly, pim-1 expression is also induced by other cytokines activating STAT3 (IL-6) or STAT5 (IL-2, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Thus, pim-1 expression in response to cytokines may be mediated by binding of STAT1, STAT3, or STAT5 to a single GAS promoter element, indicating redundancy between STAT proteins in this case.We have recently shown that the activation of STAT factors is correlated with IL-9-induced proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The experiments presented here suggest that activation of a single STAT is sufficient to obtain a significant (but lower) IL-9 response, pointing to an additive effect of STAT factors. In line with our data, a potent constitutively active mutant of STAT5 has been shown recently to drive Ba/F3 proliferation in the presence of serum (38Onishi M. Nosaka T. Misawa K. Mui A. Gorman D. McMahon M. Miyajima A. Kitamura T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Identification of the STAT-regulated genes that are responsible for proliferation should help to understand this effect.Finally, analysis of protection against dexamethasone-induced apoptosis revealed functional redundancy between IL-9-activated STAT3 and STAT5. Moreover, the use of a constitutively activated STAT5 protein demonstrated that STAT activation alone is sufficient to protect against apoptosis. Interestingly, STAT5 is also activated by IL-2 and IL-7, which are other potent inhibitors of glucocorticoid-induced cell death (7Renauld J.-C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that IL-6 fails to prevent apoptosis in STAT3-deficient T cells (39Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with our results. By contrast, STAT1 might not be involved in the process since IFN-γ did not inhibit apoptosis in our model.We hypothesize that this effect of IL-9 is mediated by the induction of a gene via either STAT3 or STAT5. However, we failed so far to detect any change in the expression of well known inhibitors of apoptosis such as bcl-2, bcl-X, and iap family genes in BW5147 cells. Alternatively, STAT3 and STAT5 dimers have been shown to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor and, at least for STAT5, to repress glucocorticoid-mediated transcription (40Stöcklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J. Fuentes N. Fuller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, IL-9 does not inhibit the expression of several corticoid-regulated genes in T cell clones (9Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. Demoulin J.-B. Baughman G. Bourgeois S. Sugamura K. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). Further work will have to determine which mechanism may account for apoptosis inhibition by IL-9. In summary, the results reported here show that the activation of distinct STAT factors in response to IL-9 plays both specific and redundant roles in the activity of this cytokine and that cooperation between STAT proteins may be required for some complex activities such as proliferation. Interleukin-9 (IL-9)1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is active on hematopoietic progenitors, lymphocytes, and mast cells (1Renauld J.-C. Kermouni A. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Demoulin J.-B. Renauld J.-C. Int. Rev.

Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In particular, IL-9 inhibits apoptosis in T lymphomas and enhances their proliferation (7Renauld J.-C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vink A. Renauld J.-C. Warnier G. Van Snick J. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). IL-9 interacts with a complex composed of the IL-9 receptor (IL-9R) and the IL-2 receptor γ-chain. Other cytokines using the IL-2 receptor γ-chain, namely IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 (10Demoulin J.-B. Renauld J.-C. Cytokines Cell. Mol. Ther. 1998; 4: 243-256PubMed Google Scholar), share some activities with IL-9 such as T cell proliferation in vitro and inhibition of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Yet, IL-9 specifically induces the expression of several genes, such as Ly-6A/E, granzymes, and mast cell-specific genes, which are not regulated by IL-2. We recently showed that these effects are mediated by the JAK (Janus kinase)-STAT (signaltransducer and activator oftranscription) pathway (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). IL-9 activates two JAK tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, pre-associated with IL-9R and the IL-2 receptor γ-chain, respectively (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 12Russell S. Johnston J. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.

Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 297-304PubMed Google Scholar). These kinases are responsible for the activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 transcription factors by IL-9 (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Bauer J. Liu K. You Y. Lai S. Goldsmith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9255-9260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Unlike classical kinase substrates, the type of STAT activated by a given cytokine is not dependent on the type of activated JAK kinase, but on the ability of receptor phosphotyrosine motifs to interact with certain STAT SH2 (Src homology 2) domains (15Darnell J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). For instance, the phospho-Tyr-Glu-XX-His sequence in the IFN-γ receptor interacts specifically with STAT1 (16Greenlund A.C. Farrar M. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), and phospho-Tyr-XX-Gln motifs in gp130 do so with STAT3 (17Stahl N. Farruggella T. Boulton T. Zhong Z. Darnell J. Yancopoulos G. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). A second factor controlling specificity lies in the DNA sequences recognized by each STAT complex, as shown by EMSA in vitro analysis (18Schindler U. Wu P. Rothe M. Brasseur M. McKnight S. Immunity. 1995; 2: 689-697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 19Rothman P. Kreider B. Azam M. Levy D. Wegenka U. Eilers A. Decker T. Horn F. Kashleva H. Ihle J. Schindler C. Immunity. 1994; 1: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, STAT5 binds to the β-casein promoter element (βCAS) required for the control of this gene by prolactin (20Wakao H. Gouilleux F. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2182-2191Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other DNA sequences, such as GRR, a Fcγ receptor type I promoter motif responsible for regulation by IFN-γ, bind to most STAT factors (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 21Lin J.-X. Migone T.-S. Tsang M. Friedmann M. Weatherbee J. Zhou L. Yamauchi A. Bloom E. Mietz J. John S. Leonard W. Immunity. 1995; 2: 331-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). However, it is not known if the Fcγ receptor type I gene can be regulated in vivo via all these STAT proteins. More generally, specificity in the regulation of gene expression by different STAT proteins has been studied only to a limited extent (22Leonard W. O'Shea J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Activation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 by IL-9 depends on a single phosphotyrosine at position 367 in IL-9R. This amino acid is also required for gene induction, cell growth regulation, and apoptosis inhibition by IL-9 (11Demoulin J.-B. Uyttenhove C. Van Roost E. de Lestré B. Donckers D. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4710-4716Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Bauer J. Liu K. You Y. Lai S. Goldsmith M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9255-9260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to discriminate between the respective roles of each STAT in IL-9 signaling by mutating amino acids surrounding IL-9R tyrosine 367. Our data point to a specific role for STAT1 and STAT3 in differentiation gene induction. By contrast, protection against apoptosis and proliferation was observed in mutants activating either STAT5 or both STAT1 and STAT3, suggesting redundancy in these cases. DISCUSSIONActivation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 by IL-9 depends on a single phosphorylated tyrosine of IL-9R (tyrosine 367). Here, we show that distinct amino acids surrounding tyrosine 367 are involved in the activation of these factors: full STAT1 activation required proline 369 and glutamine 370; STAT3 required glutamine 370; and STAT5 required leucine 368, in line with proposed consensus sequences (11Demoulin J.-B.

The results are summarized in Table I. We first showed that induction of differentiation genes such as granzyme A, Ly-6A/E, and L-selectin could be mediated by STAT1 alone, although STAT3 (but not STAT5) may also be involved. Granzyme A has been identified as a gene induced by IL-9 (but not by IL-2) in the TS2 T cell clone (25Louahed J. Kermouni A. Van Snick J. Renauld J.-C. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5061-5070PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, IL-9 activates the same STAT proteins as in BW5147 cells, whereas IL-2 activates only STAT5.2 Thus, our data suggest that specific gene induction in this model could be due to a distinct STAT activation pattern. Moreover, IFN-γ and IL-6, cytokines that activated only STAT1 or both STAT1 and STAT3, also induced the expression of granzyme A and Ly-6A/E in BW5147 cells. Further analysis of the STAT-binding site in the Ly-6A/E promoter indicated that differences in DNA-binding properties of the different STAT proteins account for specific gene induction. Analysis of mice deficient in STAT1 and/or STAT3 should further establish the role of these STAT proteins in gene induction by IL-9.Table ISTAT1, STAT3, and/or STAT5 activation: correlation with IL-9 activitiesCytokine/receptorActivated STATGranzyme A Ly-6A2L-selectinpim-1ProliferationApoptosis inhibitionIL-9/wild-type1, 3, 5++++++IL-9/mut1−−−−−IL-9/mut61, 3++++++IL-9/mut75−−+++IL-9/mut9(1), 3, 5+ND1-aND, not determined.ND+++IFN-γ1++1-bIFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26, 36).−IL-6(1), 3++1-bIFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26, 36).+IL-35−+++IL-251-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).2+1-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).2+1-cIn murine T helper cell lines such as TS2 (9,25).21-a ND, not determined.1-b IFN-γ and IL-6 have been reported to induce pim-1 in another system (26Yip-Scheider M.

Moreover, the use of a constitutively activated STAT5 protein demonstrated that STAT activation alone is sufficient to protect against apoptosis. Interestingly, STAT5 is also activated by IL-2 and IL-7, which are other potent inhibitors of glucocorticoid-induced cell death (7Renauld J.-C. Vink A. Louahed J. Van Snick J. Blood. 1995; 85: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that IL-6 fails to prevent apoptosis in STAT3-deficient T cells (39Takeda K. Kaisho T. Yoshida N. Takeda J. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4652-4660PubMed Google Scholar), in agreement with our results. By contrast, STAT1 might not be involved in the process since IFN-γ did not inhibit apoptosis in our model. We hypothesize that this effect of IL-9 is mediated by the induction of a gene via either STAT3 or STAT5. However, we failed so far to detect any change in the expression of well known inhibitors of apoptosis such as bcl-2, bcl-X, and iap family genes in BW5147 cells. Alternatively, STAT3 and STAT5 dimers have been shown to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor and, at least for STAT5, to repress glucocorticoid-mediated transcription (40Stöcklin E. Wissler M. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Nature. 1996; 383: 726-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 41Zhang Z. Jones S. Hagood J. Fuentes N. Fuller G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30607-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, IL-9 does not inhibit the expression of several corticoid-regulated genes in T cell clones (9Louahed J. Renauld J.-C. Demoulin J.-B. Baughman G. Bourgeois S. Sugamura K. Van Snick J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3704-3710PubMed Google Scholar). Further work will have to determine which mechanism may account for apoptosis inhibition by IL-9. In summary, the results reported here show that the activation of distinct STAT factors in response to IL-9 plays both specific and redundant roles in the activity of this cytokine and that cooperation between STAT proteins may be required for some complex activities such as proliferation.

Inhibition of p38α by the specific inhibitor SB 203580 prevented activation-induced cell death in T cells. SB 203580 had no effect on Fas-initiated apoptosis. Instead, SB 203580 preferentially inhibited activation-induced Fas ligand (FasL) expression. The inhibition on FasL expression by SB 203580 was correlated with the suppression on the FasL promoter activation. Overexpression of active MAPK kinase 3b, the activator of p38 MAPK, led to activation of FasL promoter and induction of FasL transcripts in T cells. Stress stimulation of T cells by anisomycin also induced FasL expression in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner. The induction of FasL expression in nonlymphoid cells such as 293T also required activation of p38 MAPK. Our results suggest that p38 MAPK is essential for FasL expression. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is activated by T cell receptor engagement.

T cell receptor engagement leads to increased expression of Fas and FasL.

In this study, we examined the role of p38 MAPK in activation-induced lymphocyte death. We observed that suppression of p38α by SB 203580 substantially prevented activation-induced cell death in T cells. The inhibition of activation-induced cell death by SB 203580 was attributed to a suppression of the FasL expression. The role of p38 MAPK was further demonstrated by the fact that activation of p38 MAPK by MKK3b increased FasL expression. Our results suggest the possibility that apoptosis induction may be enhanced by p38 MAPK activation through increased expression of FasL. Concanavalin A, TPA, and A23187 were purchased from Sigma.

Lai M.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18094-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For study on activation-induced apoptosis, splenic T cells were activated with TPA/A23187 for 24 h. Activated splenic T cells were then washed and incubated in the presence of IL-2 (10 units/ml) for another 3 days before anti-CD3 treatment. 1.6 × 107 T cells were washed once with STBS (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2) and incubated with DNA in 1.2 ml of STBS containing 0.5 mg/ml DEAE-dextran for 20 min at room temperature. T cells were then treated with 15% dimethyl sulfoxide for 3 min and washed once with STBS (54Hsueh Y.-P. Liang H.-E. Ng S.-Y. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 85-93PubMed Google Scholar). For luciferase activity, the production of light through oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP was measured using a luminometer. For transfections with pGL2-FasL and PGL2-basic, 1 μg of pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was included (50Ho H.-Y. Lee H.-H. Lai M.-Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity was normalized against the β-galactosidase activity determined in each transfection. Cell extracts (10–30 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) for 4 h at 20 V. Membranes were washed in rinse buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 2% Tween 20) at room temperature for 15 min and incubated in blocking buffer (5% nonfat milk in rinse buffer) for 1.5 h. The membrane was then incubated with anti-p38α antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-p38β (36Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J.

The membrane was incubated with 1:1000 diluted horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig antibody (Sigma) followed by development with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by using oligo(dT) as primer. One-tenth of the cDNA synthesized was then amplified by using the following primers: mouse Fas 5′-ATC CGA GCT CTG AGG AGG CGG GTT CAT GAA AC; mouse Fas 3′-GGT TCT AGA TTC AGG GTC ATC CTG; mouse FasL 5′-CAG CTC TTC CAC CTG CAG AAG G; mouse FasL 3′-AGA TTC CTC AAA ATT GAT CAG AGA GAG (55Collette Y. Razanajaona D. Ghiotto M. Olive D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); human Fas 5′-TGC CCA AGT GAC TGA CAT CAA C; human Fas 3′-AAG AAG AAG ACA AAG CCA CCC C; human FasL 5′-CAG CTC TTC CAC CTA CAG AAG G; and human FasL 3′-CAT TGA TCA CAA GCC CAC C. All cultures were performed in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol. The extent of apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide staining. At the end of different treatments, cells were resuspended in hypotonic fluorochrome solution (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) (56Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4415) Google Scholar) and placed at 4 °C in the dark overnight. DNA contents were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Fraction of cells with sub-G1 DNA content was assessed using the CELLFIT software program (Becton Dickinson) (57Hsu S.-C. Wu C.-C. Luh T.-Y. Chou C.-K. Han S.-H. Lai M.-Z. Blood. 1998; 91: 2658-2663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T cells were treated with anti-CD3, TPA/A23187, anisomycin, or hydrogen peroxide in the absence or presence of SB 203580 (10 μm). Cell lysates were prepared 20 min after activation, and 100–200 μg of lysate was precipitated with 1 μg of anti-p38α or anti-p38δ antibodies (36Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) for p38 assay, 1 μg of anti-ERK2 C-14 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) for ERK assay (53Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18094-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), or 1 μl of anti-JNK1 Ab101 (58Meyer C.F. Wang X. Chang C. Templeton D. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) for JNK assay, followed by 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose. The kinase activity of the immune complexes was determined by using GST-ATF-2 (1–109) as substrates for p38 assay, myelin basic protein as substrates for ERK assay, or GST-c-Jun (1–79) as substrates for JNK assay. The reaction mixtures were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). T cell activation is accompanied by activation of p38 MAPK. Treatment of EL4 T cells with TPA/A23187 led to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK to an extent indistinguishable from stimulation with sorbitol or TNF-α (Fig.1 A). This was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation kinase assay using GST-ATF-2 (1–109) as substrate (Fig. 1 B). Similar to anisomycin treatment, TPA/A23187 treatment significantly activated p38α in EL4 T cells. The p38 MAPK activation mediated by T cell activation was not limited to stimulation with TPA/A23187. Engagement of T cell receptor in EL4 cells by anti-CD3 antibody also induced activation of p38α (Fig.1 C). Activation of p38α was further enhanced when co-stimulated with anti-CD28. A similar extent of p38α activation by TCR engagement was found in T cell hybridomas 10I and 9C12.7 (52Lee M.-R. Liou M.-L. Liou M.-L. Yang Y.-F. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5208-5217PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in the purified splenic T cells (Fig. 1 C, not shown for 9C12.7 and splenic T cells). Both anisomycin- and TCR-coupled p38α kinase activation was substantially inhibited by SB 203580 (10 μm) (Fig. 1, B and C). As report previously (37Wang X.S. Diener K. Manthey C.L. Wang S. Rosenzweig B. Bray J. Delaney J. Cole C.N. Chan-Hui P.-Y. Mantlo N. Lichenstein H.S. Zukowski M. Yao Z. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 4246-4252PubMed Google Scholar) and confirmed in our immunoblots (not shown), p38α and p38δ are the major isoforms of p38 MAPK in T lymphocytes. p38δ is not inhibited by SB 203580 (35Goedert M. Cuenda A. Craxton M. Jakes R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 36Jiang Y. Gram H. Zhao M. New L. Gu J. Feng L. Di Padova F. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. J.

We next examined whether p38δ was activated by TCR engagement. Immunoprecipitation kinase assay indicated that, in contrast to p38α, p38δ was not activated by stimulation with anti-CD3 or anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 (Fig. 1 C). Neither did treatment of anisomycin activate p38δ in T cells (not shown). On the contrary, hydrogen peroxide was an effective activator of both p38α and p38δ in T cells (Fig. 1 D). Hydrogen peroxide-activated p38α, but not p38δ, was suppressed by SB 203580. The induction of p38 MAPK activation was essential for TCR-mediated IL-2 production (46Matsuda S. Moriguchi T. Koyasu S. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12378-12382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 48Zhang J. Salojin K.V. Gao J.-X. Cameron M.J. Bergerot I. Delovitch T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3819-3829PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that IL-2 secretion was suppressed by 45% with the addition of SB 203580 at concentration as low as 0.625 μm in concanavalin A-stimulated splenic T cells (not shown). Further inhibition was found at higher concentrations of SB 203580. The same extent of inhibition was seen in EL4 and 10I T cells (not shown). Because the concentrations of SB 203580 (10–20 μm) used in the present study have been reported to inhibit JNK activation in monocytes and neuronal cells (59Dean J.L.E. Brook M. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 264-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 60Le-Niculescu H. Bonfoco E. Kasuya Y. Claret F.-X. Green D.R. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), we tested whether JNK was similarly suppressed in T cells. As a control, TCR-induced ERK activation was not affected by SB 203580 (Fig.2). Anti-CD3-induced JNK activation was slightly enhanced in the presence of SB 203580. Therefore, the effect observed with SB 203580 was not due to an inhibition of JNK and ERK in activated T cells. Because activation of p38 MAPK is essential for T cell activation, we investigated whether p38 MAPK was involved in activation-induced cell death. Activation of immature T cells such as T hybridomas by anti-CD3 induced cell death (52Lee M.-R. Liou M.-L. Liou M.-L. Yang Y.-F. Lai M.-Z. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5208-5217PubMed Google Scholar), as assessed by DNA fragmentation using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig.3 A). SB 203580 by itself did not trigger significant cell death during the time course of experiments (18–24 h). However, as previously reported (61Nemoto S. Xiang J. Huang S. Lin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16415-16420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), prolonged incubation with SB 203580 (>24 h) did trigger apoptosis in T cells. All cell death analyses were thus conducted within 24 h period. Activation-induced cell death in T cell hybridoma 10I was suppressed by SB 203580, with a reduction in hypohaploid fraction from 45 to 15% (Fig. 3 A). The extent of inhibition decreased with reduced concentrations of SB 203580 (Fig. 3 B), yet antagonism on activation-induced death was evident with 5 μm SB 203580. A similar inhibitory effect of SB 203580 was also observed in 9C12.7 and reactivated splenic T cells (not shown). Previous reports have demonstrated that Fas-initiated apoptosis was completely resistant to SB 203580 (62Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol.

UV-B activates JNKs via UV-B-induced ribotoxic stress. Because oxidative stress also activates JNKs, we have addressed the question of whether the ribotoxic and the oxidative stress responses are mechanistically similar. The pro-oxidants sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and hydrogen peroxide activated JNK1 with slow kinetics, whereas UV-B potentiated the activity of JNK1 rapidly.N-acetyl cysteine (a scavenger of reactive oxygen intermediates) abolished the ability of all oxidative stressors tested to activate JNK1, but failed to affect the activation of JNK1 by UV-B or by another ribotoxic stressor, the antibiotic anisomycin. In contrast, emetine, an inhibitor of the ribotoxic stress response, was unable to inhibit the activation of JNK1 by oxidative stressors. Although UV-A and long wavelength UV-B are the spectral components of the ultraviolet solar radiation that cause significant oxidative damage to macromolecules, the use of a filter to eliminate the radiation output from wavelengths below 310 nm abolished the activation of JNK1 by UV.

Similar to the short wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UV-C, λ = 200–280 nm), UV-B produces oxygen-independent damage to DNA, RNA, and proteins. Similar to the long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UV-A, λ = 320–400 nm), UV-B also induces oxidative damage to diverse cellular substrates. Murine fibroblasts exposed to UV-B generate superoxide anion radicals (O⨪2), which are, in turn, dismutated to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide dismutases (1Masaki H. Sakurai H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1997; 14: 207-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus generated, H2O2 further participates in the Fenton reaction (H2O2 + Fe2+ →⋅OH + OH− + Fe3+) to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) (2Masaki H. Atsumi T. Sakurai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Apart from fibroblast cultures, the Fenton reaction has also been detected in UV-B-irradiated mouse skin (3Taira J. Mimura K. Yoneya T. Hagi A. Murakami A. Makino K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 693-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals contribute to cellular damage by inducing lipid peroxidation. In addition to the generation of ⋅OH, H2O2 can react with hypochlorous acid (HOCl) to generate singlet oxygen (1O2). Indeed, 1O2 has been detected in UV-B irradiated mammalian cells (4Dalle Carbonare M. Pathak M.A. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 1992; 14: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a substantial component of the oxygen-dependent damage to DNA (formation of the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine lesion) in response to UV-B has been attributed to the generation of1O2 (5Zhang X. Rosenstein B.S. Wang Y. Lebwohl M. Wei H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The cytoprotective, survival reaction of cells to UV-C and UV-B involves the rapid activation of the pre-existing transcription factor AP-1, a dimer composed of members of the c-Fos and c-Jun families of gene products. AP-1 activation is mediated by a profound (10–100-fold) increase in the activity of a group of related serine/threonine protein kinases collectively termed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) (reviewed in Ref. 6Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). JNKs phosphorylate and activate c-Jun, as well as the transcription factors TCF/Elk-1 and ATF-2 that positively regulate the expression of the c-fos and c-jun genes, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 7Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of UV-C- and UV-B-induced activation of JNKs have been subjects of considerable investigation and debate over the last few years (8Adler V. Schaffer A. Kim J. Dolan L. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26071-26077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 9Adler V. Polotskaya A. Kim J. Dolan L. Davis R. Pincus M. Ronai Z.

We have recently discovered a novel signaling pathway to JNK1 that is initiated in, or in close proximity to, the functional center of actively translating eukaryotic ribosomes (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This center contains the 3′-end of 28 S rRNA and its proteinaceous environment and is responsible for aminoacyl-tRNA binding, peptidyl transfer, and ribosome translocation. This region of the 28 S rRNA is the target of the antibiotics anisomycin and blasticidin S and of the enzymatic ribotoxins ricin A chain and α-sarcin, all of which strongly activate JNK1 (see Ref. 12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and a detailed list of references therein). The activation of JNK1 by the foregoing agents was termed the ribotoxic stress response and is characterized by the absolute requirement for the presence of actively translating ribosomes at the moment of cellular encounter with the 28 S rRNA-acting antibiotic or ribotoxin. Cells whose ribosomes are not engaged in translational elongation fail to activate JNK1 in response to these agents. In contrast, the activation of JNK1 by nonribotoxic stressors, such as inflammatory cytokines, osmotic stress, and some DNA-damaging drugs, is intact in cells containing nontranslating ribosomes (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, both UV-C and UV-B require the presence of active ribosomes to activate JNK1; furthermore, nucleotide- and position-specific damage to the 3′-end of 28 S rRNA was detected in UV-C- or UV-B-irradiated cells (10Iordanov M.S.

We concluded, therefore, that both UV-C and UV-B trigger the ribotoxic stress response that leads to the activation of JNK1. Our previous work, however, has not addressed the possibility that the ribotoxic stress response triggered by UV-C- or UV-B may be mediated by UV-induced oxidative damage (for instance to RNA or protein components of ribosomes). Such a possibility is plausible because the damage to the 28 S rRNA incurred in response to UV-C involved guanosine-specific lesions (potentially 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanosines) (10Iordanov M.S.

Indeed, oxidative stressors are potent activators of JNK activity. Sodium arsenite, the carcinogenic form of trivalent arsenic (As3+), has been found to induce elevated levels of⋅OH through depletion of cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) (13Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar). Arsenite interacts directly with the sulfhydryl group of both GSH and proteins, leading to the formation of mixed protein-As-GS complexes (14Winski S.L. Carter D.E. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1995; 46: 379-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 15Jennette K.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 1981; 40: 233-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several groups have reported that arsenite is a potent activator of JNK activity (16Cavigelli M. Li W.W. Lin A. Su B. Yoshioka K. Karin M.

H2O2, a precursor of ⋅OH (see above), was found to activate JNK as well (20Dhar V. Adler V. Lehmann A. Ronai Z. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 841-846PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S.

Cadmium chloride, an agent that, similar to sodium arsenite, depletes the cellular levels of reduced GSH (13Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar), has also been found to activate JNK (19Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkovsky H.L. J. Biol.

In this investigation we have employed Rat-1 fibroblasts (the cells used initially to describe the ribotoxic stress response) to address the question of whether UV-B, on the one hand, and three oxidative stressors (sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and H2O2), on the other hand, share common signal transduction pathways to induce the activation of JNK1. We present several lines of evidence that suggest that UV-B does not activate JNK1 through oxidative damage. First, sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and H2O2 activated JNK1 with relatively slow kinetics, whereas UV-B potentiated JNK1 activity rapidly. Second, pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, a potent scavenger of H2O2, ⋅OH, and HOCl (25Gillissen A. Scharling B. Jaworska M. Bartling A. Rasche K. Schultze-Werninghaus G. Res. Exp.

Third, emetine, an immediate inhibitor of ribosomal translocation and of UV-B- and anisomycin-induced activation of JNK1 (10Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J.

Fourth, eliminating more than 90% of the spectral output below 310 nm (i.e. the wavelengths that produce more direct, oxygen-independent damage to macromolecules than oxidative damage) abolished the activation of JNK1 by UV. Taken together, these results strongly argue that, although oxidative damage plays a role in the long-term effects of UV-B, it does not participate in the immediate-early cellular response that involves the activation of JNK. Anisomycin, sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and N-acetyl cysteine were from Sigma. Recombinant mouse IL-1α was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). H2O2 was from Fisher Chemicals (Fair Lawn, NJ). The cell culture and all experimental techniques employed in this work have been previously described in Iordanov et al. (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, JNK1 activity was determined by a coupled immunoprecipitation/immunocomplex kinase assay using an anti-JNK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., sc-474) to precipitate the active kinase and GST-Elk1 recombinant protein as a substrate for phosphorylation (12Iordanov M.S.

The phosphorylated GST-Elk1 was quantified from dried gels using a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager and IP Lab Gel software (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L.

The activation of SEK1/MKK4 was determined in a Western blot procedure using an antibody directed against SEK1/MKK4 protein phosphorylated at Thr-223 (New England BioLabs Inc., Beverly, MA, 9151S). The antibody was used following the instruction of the manufacturer (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization with the phospho-specific antibody, the same membrane was stripped, and total SEK1/MKK4 protein was detected through re-hybridization using the anti-SEK1/MKK4 antibody K-18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The UV-B source and the method of UV-B irradiation of cells have been described in Iordanov et al. (10Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The A-18 glass filter was from Eastman-Kodak. For the NAC pretreatment of cells, cell culture medium was made to contain 30 mm NAC freshly before use. The pH of the NAC-containing medium was then adjusted with NaOH to the pH value of the medium without NAC. Either NAC-free or NAC-containing medium (after equilibrating in humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2) was then used to exchange the old cell culture mediums 30 min before treatment with UV-B or another agent. In Rat-1 cells irradiated with UV-B, the activity of JNK1 was markedly elevated as early as 15 min after the irradiation and remained elevated throughout the next 2 h, as determined in immunocomplex kinase activity assays (12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 9–12). This kinetics of activation resembled that observed in anisomycin-treated cells (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 25–28). In contrast, the activity of JNK1 in cells treated with sodium arsenite was not substantially elevated 15 min after the treatment and displayed a slow, graded, increase during the 2 h postincubation period (Fig. 1, compare lanes 1–4 with lanes 17–20). Similarly, cadmium chloride-treated cells displayed a slow, graded, dose-dependent, increase in JNK1 activity (Fig.2 B, lanes 1–8, and not shown). The response of JNK1 in Rat-1 cells treated with H2O2 appeared to be complex; activation of JNK1 was not observed in cells treated with doses below 1 mm(not shown) as well as in cells treated with 10 mmH2O2 (Fig. 2 A, lanes 6–9). Potent activation of JNK1 was observed only in cells treated with 1 mm H2O2 and, in addition, reproducibly only at 4 h after the treatment (Fig.2 B, lanes 2–5). These results demonstrate that three oxidative stressors (sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, and H2O2) are slow activators of JNK1, whereas the ribotoxic stressors UV-B and anisomycin are rapid JNK1 activators.Figure 2Kinetics and dose-dependence of JNK1 activation in response to treatment with H2O2 and cadmium chloride and the effect of NAC on JNK1 activity.

To investigate whether UV-B-induced activation of JNK is dependent on reactive oxygen intermediates, we employed pretreatment of Rat-1 cells with NAC (30 mm) for 30 min before challenging the cells with UV-B or other stimuli. Because NAC acidifies the cell culture medium (not shown), we adjusted the pH of the medium containing NAC to physiological values (pH ∼8.0 at atmospheric CO2concentrations; decreases to pH ∼7.0 at 5% CO2). Under these conditions, NAC specifically abolished the ability of sodium arsenite (Fig. 1, compare lanes 17–20 with lanes 21–24), cadmium chloride (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1–8 with lanes 9–16), and H2O2 (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) to activate JNK1. However, neither UV-B- nor anisomycin-induced JNK1 activities were affected by NAC pretreatment (Fig. 1, compare lanes 9–12 with lanes 13–16 and lanes 25–28 with lanes 29–32). Furthermore, the activation of JNK1 in response to IL-1α was not affected by NAC (Fig. 1, compare lanes 33–36 with lanes 37–40). We considered the possibility that NAC might have failed to inhibit rapid JNK activators (such as UV-B and anisomycin) because of the insufficient time of pretreatment with NAC (30 min, see Fig. 1). Rat-1 cells were therefore pretreated with NAC for 4 h and then challenged with UV-B for 15 min. Even under these conditions NAC failed to inhibit the activation of JNK1 by UV-B, whereas, in the same experiment, NAC completely inhibited cadmium chloride-induced JNK1 activity (Fig. 3 A). Next, we considered the possibility that the failure of NAC to inhibit UV-B-induced JNK1 activity might result from the high (presumably, saturating) doses of radiation (1200 J/m2 UV-B). However, NAC also failed to inhibit JNK1 activities induced by significantly lower does of UV-B radiation (150, 300, or 600 J/m2; Fig.3 B). In fact, NAC slightly potentiated the UV-B-induced activity of JNK1, especially at lower UV-B doses (Fig. 3 B). The ability of NAC to potentiate the activation of JNK1 by UV-B, however, might be because of the slightly elevated levels of JNK1 basal activity in the presence of NAC (Fig. 3 B, see 0 J/m2, and also see Figs. 2 A and 3 A, graphs). We have recently reported that agents that induce ribotoxic stress activate the JNK1 cascade through signal transduction pathways that are independent (downstream) of cell surface cytokine receptors but are upstream of the dual specificity protein kinase MKK4/SEK1 (also known as JNK kinase-1, JNKK1) (10Iordanov M.S.

Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate whether MKK4/SEK1 is activated by oxidative stressors as well, we monitored the phosphorylation of threonine 223 of this kinase, an event indicative of MKK4/SEK1 activation by upstream kinases such as MEKK1 (31Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 32Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Similar to the ribotoxic stressor UV-B (Fig.4, lanes 5–7), both cadmium chloride and sodium arsenite induced a clear pattern of MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, lanes 11–14, and not shown for sodium arsenite) as detected in immunoblot assays using an antibody specific for MKK4/SEK1 protein phosphorylated at threonine 223. The kinetics of MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylation by either UV-B or cadmium chloride correlated closely with the kinetics of JNK1 activation by the same agents (compare Fig. 1, lanes 9–12, to Fig. 4, lanes 5–7, and Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–8, to Fig. 4, lanes 11–14). In agreement with the results obtained using JNK1, NAC was unable to reduce the UV-B-induced MKK4/SEK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, compare lanes 5–7 with lanes 8–10) but was very efficient in inhibiting the phosphorylation of the kinase induced by cadmium chloride and sodium arsenite (Fig. 4, compare lanes 11–14 with lanes 15–18, and not shown for sodium arsenite). We concluded, therefore, that the ribotoxic stress- and the oxidative stress-induced signal transduction pathways to JNK1 are separate, but converge at, or upstream of, MKK4/SEK1. We have previously demonstrated that the most characteristic feature of the ribotoxic stress-induced signaling to JNK1 is its absolute requirement for ribosomes actively engaged in translational elongation to elicit a signaling cascade to JNK1 (10Iordanov M.S.

Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells, pretreated with emetine (and inhibitor of translational elongation), cannot activate JNK1 in response to ribotoxic stress, but possess a full capacity to activate JNK1 in response to cytokines, osmotic stress, and DNA-damaging agents (10Iordanov M.S.

Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The possible effects of ribosomal inhibitors on the oxidative stress-induced JNK1 activation have not, however, been investigated. Fig. 5 demonstrates the ability of emetine pretreatment to abolish the activation of JNK1 by UV-B. However, neither sodium arsenite- nor cadmium chloride-induced activation of JNK1 was inhibited by emetine pretreatment (Fig. 5). We concluded, therefore, that oxidative damage-induced signal transduction to JNK1 is ribosome-independent. Both in vitro and in living cells, the ratio of oxidative damage (e.g. the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine lesion, 8-oxodGuo) to direct damage (e.g. the cyclobutyl pyrimidine dimers, CPD) caused by UV increases with the wavelength. For instance, at equal doses, the 8-oxodGuo/CPD ratio for UV-A (320–400 nm)-irradiated HeLa cells was found to be approximately 1000-fold higher than that for UV-B- (280–320 nm) or UV-C (200–280 nm)-irradiated HeLa cells (33Zhang X. Rosenstein B.S. Wang Y. Lebwohl M. Mitchell D.M. Wei H. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If UV-induced oxidative damage is an important intermediate in the signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation of JNK1, the action spectrum of UV (measured by JNK1 activation) should be shifted toward wavelengths with high 8-oxodGuo/CPD ratios (i.e. UV-A). Because the UV-B source employed in our work has a substantial portion of UV-A spectral output (Fig. 6 A), it became possible to address this question experimentally. We observed that the A-18 glass filter from Eastman-Kodak retains more than 90% of the UV wavelengths shorter than 310 nm (Fig. 6 A). By appropriately adjusting the irradiation time, we were able to deliver to cells equal doses of radiant energy containing either 100% of the original 280–310 nm spectral output (irradiation without the A-18 filter) or less than 10% of the original 280–310 nm spectral output (irradiation through the A-18 filter). Fig. 6 B demonstrates that the use of the A-18 filter to eliminate more than 90% of the 280–310 nm spectral output abolished the ability of UV to activate JNK1 (compare lanes 1–6 with lanes 7–11). Thus, the JNK1-activating spectral portion of the UV source used belongs to the wavelengths below 310 nm that have lower 8-oxodGuo/CPD ratios than UV-A. This finding is consistent with the previous results (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) indicating that UV-B activates JNK1 through mechanisms that do not involve UV-induced oxidative damage. Ultraviolet radiation and oxidative agents are relevant environmental hazards for eukaryotic organisms with cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and tumor-promoting properties. Whereas the biochemistry of reactive oxygen intermediates is relatively well understood, the modes of biological action of UV are considerably more complex, as they involve both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent (direct) damage to biomolecules. Although some of the biological activities of UV might be attributed to UV-induced oxidative stress, the question of the role of oxidative stress in the cellular transcriptional responses to UV (that involve the activation of cytoplasmic tyrosine- and serine/threonine-directed protein kinases) has not been extensively addressed. Recently, JNKs have emerged as important mediators of the transcriptional stress responses in mammalian cells to both UV and oxidative stressors. Because of their responsiveness to both UV and oxidative stressors, JNKs constitute biologically relevant end points to investigate the dependence of UV-induced signal transduction on UV-induced oxidative damage. Previously, we have been able to demonstrate that an invariant requirement for the successful activation of JNK1 by either UV-C or UV-B is the presence, at the moment of UV irradiation, of ribosomes actively engaged in translational elongation (10Iordanov M.S.

This finding placed UV in the distinct group of JNK1 activators that share the requirement for active ribosomes to activate JNK1 and that are collectively termed ribotoxic stressors (10Iordanov M.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This group includes agents that either bind to the functional center of 28 S rRNA (anisomycin, blasticidin S, and gougerotin) or cause covalent damage to the functional center of 28 S rRNA (ricin A chain, abrin A chain, and α-sarcin). In contrast, multiple known activators of JNK1, such as signaling cytokines and hyperosmolarity, do not require the presence of active ribosomes to activate JNK1 (10Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 12Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3528-3534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of UV as a ribotoxic stressor and of active ribosomes as essential mediators of the UV-induced signal transduction to JNK1, the possibility could not be ruled out that reactive oxygen intermediates, induced in response to UV irradiation of cells, cause damage to ribosomal components (RNA and/or proteins) thus triggering a ribosome-dependent signaling to JNK1. In the work presented, we have addressed this possibility experimentally by comparing the activation of JNK1 by ribotoxic (UV-B, anisomycin) and by oxidative (sodium arsenite, cadmium chloride, H2O2) stressors. The preponderance of experimental evidence presented in this work strongly supports a notion that reactive oxygen intermediates produced in the irradiated cells do not play a role in the activation of JNK1 by ribotoxic stressors. With regard to the involvement of active ribosomes in UV-induced signal transduction, we have been able to demonstrate that active ribosomes are not required for the activation by UV of a related group of protein kinases, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERKs) (10Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Therefore, UV irradiation of cells generates at least two autonomous signaling cascades: one oxygen-independent, but ribosome-dependent that leads to the activation of JNKs; and another, ribosome-independent, that leads to the activation of ERKs. Interestingly, this second UV-stimulated signaling pathway seems to involve UV-induced oxidative damage. Knebel et al. (35Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) have presented results consistent with the notion that UV-C, UV-B, and UV-A cause oxidative damage to essential sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic pockets of protein phosphatases that dephosphorylate transmembranal receptor tyrosine kinases (such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGF-R). Decreased phosphatase activity, combined with high intrinsic kinase activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase, results in a net increase in the activity of the signal transduction pathways downstream of the respective receptor. Furthermore, Knebel et al. (35Knebel A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Ullrich A. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5314-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) present evidence that the activation by UV of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) correlates with the UV-induced inhibition of EGF-R dephosphorylation. It must be noted, however, that of all the members of the MAP kinase superfamily (that also includes the JNKs and the p38 MAP kinase families of kinases), ERKs are kinases that are the weakest in their responsiveness to UV (10Iordanov M.S.

Taken together, our results and the work of Knebel et al. contribute to an emerging picture of the UV response through the MAP kinase superfamily of protein kinases in which the UV-induced oxidative damage plays a role in the activation of ERK family of kinases, but in which oxygen-independent and ribosome-dependent mechanisms predominate in the activation by UV of the stress-activated protein kinases of the JNK and p38 MAP kinase families.

Analysis of authentic CLIP-170 and the recombinant fragments by electron microscopy after glycerol spraying/low angle rotary metal shadowing reveals CLIP-170 as a thin, 135-nm-long molecule with two kinks in its central rod domain, which are approximately equally spaced from the two ends of the protein. The central domain consisting of heptad repeats, which is alpha-helical in nature and forms a 2-stranded coiled-coil, mediates dimerization of CLIP-170. The rod domain harbors two kinks, each spaced approximately 37 nm from the corresponding end of the molecule, thus providing mechanical flexibility to the highly elongated molecule. The N-terminal domain of CLIP-170 binds to microtubules in vitro with a stoichiometry of one dimeric head domain per four tubulin heterodimers. Authentic CLIP-170 binds to microtubules with lower stoichiometry, indicating that the rod and tail domains affect microtubule binding of CLIP-170. These results document that CLIP-170 is a highly elongated polar molecule with the microtubule-binding domain and the organelle-interacting domains at opposite ends of the homodimer, thus providing a structural basis for the function of CLIP-170 as a microtubule-organelle linker protein."
https://openalex.org/W2016935977,"BAG-1 is an anti-apoptotic protein that interacts with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Hsp70/Hsc70, Raf-1 and numerous hormone or growth factor receptors. Recently, BAG-1 has been found to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and some tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of BAG-1 upregulation is still unclear. In this study, we cloned 0.9 kb of human genomic DNA, BGEV, 5' flanking the BAG-1 open reading frame. BGEV subcloned into a promoterless luciferase reporter vector conferred high promoter activity in various human cancer cell lines. Deletion analysis of this sequence localized the region of maximal BAG-1 promoter activity from nucleotide positions -353 to -54, upstream of the first start codon CTG. Sequence analysis of the BAG-1 promoter region showed the absence of a TATA box but identified a CCAAT box, several GC boxes, a CpG island and several transcriptional factor binding sites, which may be important in the regulation of BAG-1 transcription. Most importantly, functional characterization of the BAG-1 promoter in vivo demonstrated that gain-of-function p53 mutants derived from human tumors upregulated the transcription of BAG-1 RNA and the expression of a reporter gene from the BAG-1 promoter. These results indicated that we have isolated the functional constitutive BAG-1 promoter. Furthermore, the data suggested that overexpression of BAG-1 in some tumors may be due to upregulation of the human BAG-1 promoter by mutant p53."
https://openalex.org/W2072242577,"Plasma prekallikrein, a zymogen of the contact phase system, circulates in plasma as heterodimeric complex with H-kininogen. The binding is mediated by the prekallikrein heavy chain consisting of four apple domains, A1 to A4, to which H-kininogen binds with high specificity and affinity (KD = 1.2 × 10−8m). Previous work had demonstrated that a discontinuous kininogen-binding site is formed by a proximal part located in A1, a distal part exposed by A4, and other yet unidentified portion(s) of the kallikrein heavy chain. To detect relevant binding segment(s) we recombinantly expressed single apple domains and found a rank order of binding affinity for kininogen of A2 > A4 ≈ A1 > A3. Removal of single apple domains in prekallikrein deletion mutants reduced kininogen binding by 21 (A1), 64 (A2), and 24% (A4), respectively, whereas deletion of A3 was without effect. Transposition of homologous A2 domain from prekallikrein to factor XI conferred high-affinity kininogen binding from the former to the latter. The principal role of A2 for H-kininogen docking to the prekallikrein heavy chain was further substantiated by the finding that cleavage of a single peptide bond in A2 drastically diminished the H-kininogen binding affinity. Furthermore, the epitope of monoclonal antibody PKH6 which blocks kallikrein-kininogen complex formation with an IC50 of 8 nm mapped to the center portion of domain A2. Our data indicate that domain A2 and two flanking sequence segments of A1 and A4 form a discontinuous binding platform for H-kininogen on the prekallikrein heavy chain. Domain-specific antibodies directed to these critical sites efficiently interfered with contact phase-induced bradykinin release from H-kininogen. Plasma prekallikrein, a zymogen of the contact phase system, circulates in plasma as heterodimeric complex with H-kininogen.

Previous work had demonstrated that a discontinuous kininogen-binding site is formed by a proximal part located in A1, a distal part exposed by A4, and other yet unidentified portion(s) of the kallikrein heavy chain. To detect relevant binding segment(s) we recombinantly expressed single apple domains and found a rank order of binding affinity for kininogen of A2 > A4 ≈ A1 > A3. Removal of single apple domains in prekallikrein deletion mutants reduced kininogen binding by 21 (A1), 64 (A2), and 24% (A4), respectively, whereas deletion of A3 was without effect. Transposition of homologous A2 domain from prekallikrein to factor XI conferred high-affinity kininogen binding from the former to the latter. The principal role of A2 for H-kininogen docking to the prekallikrein heavy chain was further substantiated by the finding that cleavage of a single peptide bond in A2 drastically diminished the H-kininogen binding affinity. Furthermore, the epitope of monoclonal antibody PKH6 which blocks kallikrein-kininogen complex formation with an IC50 of 8 nm mapped to the center portion of domain A2. Our data indicate that domain A2 and two flanking sequence segments of A1 and A4 form a discontinuous binding platform for H-kininogen on the prekallikrein heavy chain. Domain-specific antibodies directed to these critical sites efficiently interfered with contact phase-induced bradykinin release from H-kininogen. plasma prekallikrein baby hamster kidney cells bradykinin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay human embryonic kidney cells high-molecular mass kininogen maltose-binding protein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis tissue plasminogen activator phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction Human plasma prekallikrein (PPK),1 the zymogen of the plasma serine proteinase α-kallikrein is involved in the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation (1Colman R.W.

The active enzyme, α-kallikrein, is composed of a catalytically active light chain of 35 kDa and a heavy chain of 50 kDa, linked together by a single disulfide bridge (8van der Graaf F. Tans G. Bouma B.N. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14300-14305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autocatalytic cleavage at Lys140-Ala141 of its heavy chain further converts α-kallikrein into a three-chain form, β-kallikrein (9Colman R.W. Wachtfogel Y.T. Kucich U. Weinbaum G. Hahn S. Pixley R.A. Scott C.F. de Agostini A. Burger D. Schapira M. Blood. 1985; 65: 311-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses revealed that the 371 residues of the PPK heavy chain is composed of four tandem repeats of 90–91 amino acid residues each (10Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. McMullen B.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2410-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) with a unique disulfide bridge pattern where the first and sixth, second and fifth, and third and forth cysteine residues are linked (11McMullen B.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These repetitive modules, aptly dubbed “apple” domains A1 to A4, mediate the high-affinity binding of PPK to its major substrate, high molecular mass kininogen (H-kininogen, HK), with an apparent KD of 1.2 × 10−8m (12Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15396-15401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bimolecular complex docks to the plasma membranes of many cells via specific and affine cell-binding sites exposed on HK domains D3 and D5H. Local accumulation of the prohormone and its cognate processing enzyme on the surface of target cells such as neutrophils, platelets, and endothelial cells allows the extremely short-lived effector of the system, bradykinin (BK; t12 < 15 s), to act on cellular receptors next to the site of release (13Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13040-13047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To meet the requirements of a locally operating effector system, an elaborate network of complementary structures ensures that HK and PPK interact both in solution and on surfaces. HK exposes a continuous segment of 27 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal portion of domain D6H of its light chain to which PPK binds (12Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol.

Affinity cross-linking studies indicated that one interacting segment is localized in the amino-terminal portion of A1 (15Herwald H. Jahnen-Dechent W. Alla S.A. Hock J. Bouma B.N. Müller-Esterl W. J.

An antibody-based strategy as well as peptide competition studies identified a second binding segment in the center part of A4 (16Herwald H. Renné T. Meijers J.C.M. Chung D.W. Page J.D. Colman R.W.

On the amino acid level PPK exhibits 58% sequence identity to FXI, another serine proteinase of the contact activation system (1Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Gailani D. Sun M.F. Sun Y. Blood. 1997; 90: 1055-1164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Schmaier A.H. Thromb.

Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the FXI-binding site on HK overlaps with the PPK-binding site, the two zymogens mutually displace each other from the HK light chain (14Vogel R. Kaufmann J. Chung D.W. Kellermann J. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12494-12502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Tait J.F. Fujikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11651-11656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was the identification of crucial structures and domains that make up the discontinuous HK-binding site in PPK. By direct binding studies with recombinantly expressed single apple domains, by analysis of deletion mutants and chimeras of PPK and FXI where apple domains had been removed and exchanged, and by antibody competition experiments we provide convincing evidence that apple domain A2 in PPK is crucial to HK binding. We demonstrate that blockage of the relevant subsites in domains A1, A2, and A4 efficiently attenuates contact phase-dependent bradykinin release from the HK-PPK complex. HK and PPK were isolated from human plasma according to established protocols (22Hock J. Vogel R. Linke R.P. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12005-12011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Müller-Esterl W. Johnson D.A. Salvesen G. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human FXII was from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN) and activated by incubation with glass beads for 30 min at 37 °C. The generation and characterization of the mouse monoclonal antibodies to human PPK, i.e. PKH1, PKH4, PKH6, and PKL16, have been previously detailed (22Hock J. Vogel R. Linke R.P. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12005-12011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody PKH19 was raised against the synthetic peptide PK31 of the human PPK sequence (15Herwald H. Jahnen-Dechent W. Alla S.A. Hock J. Bouma B.N. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14527-14535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera AS176 and AS199 were raised in rabbits against purified human PPK and FXI, respectively. Recombinantly expressed human PPK apple domain A3 fused to human tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA; see below) was used to generate antibodies (“anti-rA3”) in mice following standard immunization protocols. Monoclonal antibodies HKL16 and HKL22 directed to domain D6H, HKH14 directed to D3, and MBK3 directed to the kinin moiety of D4 of human HK were used (24Kaufmann J. Haasemann M. Modrow S. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9079-9091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce active forms of kallikrein, PPK was incubated with FXIIa at a molar ratio of 100:1 in PBS (6.5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 2 h to give α-kallikrein or for 72 h to yield β-kallikrein. For biotinylation, 100 μg of HK was incubated with 10 μg of biotin-ε-aminocaproyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide (biotin-X-NHS, Pierce, St. Augustin, Germany) in 0.1 m NaHCO3for 4 h at 4 °C. The buffer was changed to 150 mmNaCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, and unreacted biotin-X-NHS was removed by 3 centrifugations at 2,000 ×g at 4 °C using a Microcon-10 column (Amicon, Beverly, MA) with a 10,000 Da cut-off. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293t) were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.5% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were kept under the same conditions except that Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was supplemented with fetal bovine serum (5% v/v), penicillin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and neomycin (100 μg/ml). Proteins were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) at 30 mA for 90 min. Marker proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were phosphorylase b (94 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa). The resolved proteins were visualized by silver staining or transferred to nitrocellulose at 100 mA for 30 min by the semi-dry technique. The membranes were blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) dry milk powder and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. For immunoprinting of the transferred proteins (25Towbin H. Schoenenberger C. Ball R. Braun D.G. Rosenfelder G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the first antibody was applied typically at 1:1,000 dilution in PBS/milk. Bound antibody was detected by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody against mouse immunoglobulin (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany), followed by the chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). A direct binding assay was employed to analyze HK binding to the various forms of kallikrein. A serial dilution (2n; starting concentration 8.8 μg/ml = 100 nm) of PPK, α-kallikrein, or β-kallikrein in 100 mm sodium acetate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 5.5 (coating buffer), was applied to microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). The plates were washed 6 times with PBS and blocked with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 45 min, followed by incubation with 1 μg/ml (8.3 nm) biotinylated HK in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of protease inhibitor mixture of 10 μg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and 0.1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 45 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS bound HK was detected by streptavidin-peroxidase (1 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) for 45 min, followed by the substrate, 0.15% (w/v) diammonium 2,2′-azido-bis-(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) and 0.012% (v/v) H2O2 in 100 mm citric acid, pH 4.5, for 30 min. The change in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Dynatech, Deppendorf, Germany). Alternatively PPK deletion mutants or PPK/FXI chimera (see below) present in the supernatants of transfected cells were used for coating and probed as above. To test the interaction of single recombinant apple domains with HK, fusion proteins were coated in a serial dilution (2n) starting from 10 μg/ml (200 nm), followed by incubation with 4 μg/ml (33 nm) HK, 2 μg/ml (13.3 nm) of the monoclonal antibody HKH14, and a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. All incubation steps were done at 37 °C for 45 min except for the coating which was done at 4 °C overnight. A sandwich ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of recombinant proteins present in the supernatants of transfected cells. Antibody AS176 to PPK at 1:1000 dilution was used for coating, free binding sites were blocked with PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin, serial dilutions (2n) of the supernatants were applied, and bound PPK was detected by antibody PKL16 to the PPK light chain followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody against mouse immunoglobulin and the chromogenic substrate. A competitive ELISA was established to test for the interference of unlabeled antibodies with HK·PPK complex formation. PPK was coated at 4 μg/ml (45.4 nm) and serial dilutions (2n, starting concentration 180 μg/ml = 1.2 μm) of antibodies to PPK including 1 μg/ml (8.3 nm) biotinylated HK were applied. Bound biotinylated HK was probed with streptavidin-peroxidase followed by the chromogenic substrate. Values of IC50 were calculated by the KaleidaGraph 3.05 algorithm (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). The pMAL-c2 expression system (New England Biolabs, Bad Schwalbach, Germany) was used for expression and purification of fusion proteins consisting of the bacterial maltose-binding protein (MBP) and PPK apple domains in E. coli strain BL21. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Taq polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) generated cDNA fragments encoding single PPK apple domains with the following upstream and downstream primers (Roth): 5′-gtttctagaatgattttattcaagcaagc-3′ and 5′-cgatggcaaaagcttatttaatgacc-3′ (for domain A1), 5′-catcaaataagtgaattccatcgagac-3′ and 5′-catgtgggatccaatttcttaaagg-3′ (A2), 5′-gccctttctagaattggttgcc-3′ and 5′-gcaagcttcaggttaagttcttttgcag-3′ (A3) and 5′-cctctagatatagccttttaacctgc-3′ and 5′-gcaagcttgtttatgttgtgcagacagag-3′ (A4), respectively. Plasmid pPK was used as the template in a polymerase chain reaction that comprises 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 50 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s in a thermal cycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany). Before ligating the constructs into the pMAL-c2 vector using T4 DNA-ligase (New England Biolabs), the vector and the isolated PCR products were cleaved with restriction enzymes Hin dIII and Xba I (A1), Eco RI and Bam HI (A2), Xba I and Hin dIII (A3 and A4), respectively, and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. Recombinant plasmids were propagated in E. coli XL1-blue strain; vectors were isolated by a plasmid DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) before transfection into E. coli BL21 strain for expression. Exponentially growing cultures containing the relevant constructs were stimulated for 2 h with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roth), and the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 2 times PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml each soybean trypsin inhibitor, benzamidine, leupeptin (Sigma), and 0.1 mm Pefabloc SC), put on ice, and lysed by repeated brief ultrasonic pulses for 3 min. Following centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove the cell debris, the supernatants containing the MBP-PPK apple fusion proteins were applied to an amylose resin. After extensive washing with PBS, bound proteins were eluted with PBS, 20 mm maltose, followed by gel filtration over a Sephadex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS. Pooled fractions of the fusion proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using domain-specific antibodies. The cDNA encoding single PPK apple domains, A1 (Gly1-Ser90), A2 (Ala91-Ile180), A3 (Gly181-Glu271), and A4 (Pro272-Ser362) were amplified by Taq polymerase PCR with primers introducing a Bgl II site and a Xho I site at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, of the amplified DNA. PCR products were cloned into the TA-cloning vector pCRII (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands), and subjected to dideoxy sequencing. The cDNAs were excised from pCRII by Bgl II and Xho I digestion and directionally cloned into the corresponding sites of the tPA expression vector ZpL7(Ser478-Ala) modified as described (16Herwald H. Renné T. Meijers J.C.M. Chung D.W. Page J.D. Colman R.W. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1990; 63: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The corresponding constructs encode fusion proteins with the prepro sequences of tPA, followed by a single PPK apple domain each, kringles 1/2, and the active site-mutated (Ser478-Ala) catalytic domain of tPA. The expression plasmids were transfected into BHK cells, and the corresponding fusion proteins expressed in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) were purified by immunoabsorption using a monoclonal antibody to tPA, as described (16Herwald H. Renné T. Meijers J.C.M. Chung D.W. Page J.D. Colman R.W. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13061-13067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To clone the PPK cDNA as an Eco RI unit, an internal Eco RI site encompassing codon GAA for Glu478 was eliminated by mutation to GAG using overlap extension with PCR (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) in the plasmid vector pZEM229R (a gift from Donald Foster, ZymoGenetics, Inc.). In these studies, the 5′- and 3′-noncoding sequences in the native PPK cDNA were also removed, and Eco RI sites were introduced immediately before the initiator codon and after the stop codon. In the construction process, a silent mutation in the codon for Thr577 (ACA to ACC) was introduced by Taq polymerase. This construct expressing wild-type PPK is designated pZEM-PPK. Gene splicing by overlap extension with PCR (28Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar) was used to construct deletions of each of the four apple domains; the corresponding constructs were designated pZEM-Δ1, pZEM-Δ2, pZEM-Δ3, and pZEM-Δ4, respectively, and the corresponding PPK deletion variants are dubbed Δ1 to Δ4. Similarly, chimeric constructs containing parts of FXI and PPK were spliced together by the overlap extension method. Thus, ZEM-XI codes for wild-type factor XI, whereas pZEM7.1 encodes chimera 7.1 in which the signal peptide and heavy chain of PPK are fused to the light chain of FXI, while pZEM7.2 encodes the complementary chimera 7.2 comprising the signal peptide and heavy chain of FXI fused to the light chain of PPK. pZEM6.3 encodes chimera 6.3 in which apple domain A2 in FXI is replaced by A2 of PPK, whereas pZEM6.2 encodes the complementary chimera 6.2 where A2 in PPK is exchanged for A2 of FXI. The sequence of all constructs was verified by dideoxy sequencing. When indicated, appropriate restriction fragments containing the normal sequence were used to replace and correct for misincorporations introduced by Taq polymerase. In expression studies, the respective expression units were excised by Eco RI and cloned into the Eco RI site of pcDNA3(+) (Invitrogen). Orientation of the constructs was confirmed by restriction analysis and the constructs were transfected into HEK293t cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies). The transfection efficiency monitored by parallel transfections with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein (29Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Müller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar) was ≥40%. Fusion proteins were expressed in serum-free medium. Protein concentrations in supernatants of transfected HEK293t cells were determined by sandwich ELISA (see above) and biospecific interaction analysis using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore, Freiburg, Germany). CM5 sensor chips were coated with antibodies to PPK (AS176) or FXI (AS199) using the Amine Coupling Kit provided by the manufacturer. Serial dilutions (2n) of the supernatants were applied at a continuous flow rate of 20 μl/min, and antigen-antibody association was followed for 90 s. Dissociation of the immune complex was induced by applying PBS, and monitored over 3 min. The chip was reconstituted by a brief wash with 30 mm HCl. For calibration supernatants from control cells that had been transfected with an irrelevant vector construct were spiked with varying concentrations of purified PPK. The relative protein concentrations were calculated with the BIAevaluation 2.1 program (BIAcore). HEK293t cells were transfected by the LipofectAMINE method with pcDNA3(+) vectors encoding wild-type FXI, wild-type PPK, or the chimeric constructs 6.2, 6.3, 7.1, and 7.2. After 60 h the cells were washed with Cys/Met-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and incubated for 45 min at 37 °C. Cells were labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Cys/Met (Tran35S-label, ICN, Eschwege, Germany) for 12 h at 37 °C, washed 3 times with PBS, and lysed in RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% (m/v) SDS, 0.5% (m/v) deoxycholic acid, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine-HCl) under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of a mixture of antibodies to PPK (AS176) and FXI (AS199) bound to Staphylococcus A cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The mixtures were precipitated at 8,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C, and the precipitates were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer (see above). The immunoprecipitates were dissolved in reducing sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed with sodium acetate, impregnated with 15% (w/v) sodium salicylate for 30 min at room temperature, dried for 2 h at 55 °C, and exposed to a Fuji X-Ray film for 24 h at −80 °C. Freshly drawn human citrated plasma (25 μl) was preincubated with 67.5 μg/ml (450 nm) affinity-purified antibodies to PPK apple domains (A1 to A4) or its light chain, and to HK domain D6H for 15 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of FXIIa to a final concentration of 18 μg/ml (20 nm). Following incubation for 1 h, the proteins were separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, and the integrity of the plasma HK, probed by Western blotting using antibodies MBK3 to the kinin portion (D4), was determined. Our strategy to identify relevant interaction site(s) of the PPK heavy chain with the corresponding acceptor site on the HK light chain comprised (i) the analysis of various kallikrein forms generated by limited proteolysis, (ii) the study of HK binding to recombinantly expressed single apple domains of PPK, (iii) competition studies with antibodies interfering with PPK·HK complex formation, (iv) the construction and HK binding analysis of PPK mutants where single apple domains had been deleted, (v) the construction and binding analysis of PPK-FXI chimeras where relevant apple domains had been exchanged, and (v) the study of effects of antibodies directed to the identified interaction sites of PPK and HK on FXIIa-mediated kinin liberation. Initially the binding of HK to three forms of kallikrein, namely PPK, α-kallikrein, and β-kallikrein was determined. The extent of conversion of PPK to α-kallikrein by FXIIa, and the autocatalytic conversion of α-kallikrein to β-kallikrein, was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses using PKH1 and PKH19 antibodies, specific for the A4 and A1 domains, respectively (data not shown). The binding affinity of the three forms of kallikrein for HK was assessed in direct binding assay, in which increasing concentrations of PPK, α-kallikrein, and β-kallikrein were immobilized on a microtiter plate, and exposed to 8.3 nm biotinylated HK. Bound HK was detected by the streptavidin-peroxidase system. As shown in Fig.1, biotinylated HK bound with high affinity to PPK (apparent KD = 6 nm) and α-kallikrein (4 nm), whereas the affinity to β-kallikrein was drastically reduced (90 nm). Since β-kallikrein differs from α-kallikrein in having a single peptide bond cleavage at Lys140 in the A2 domain (9Colman R.W. Wachtfogel Y.T. Kucich U. Weinbaum G. Hahn S. Pixley R.A.

Blood. 1985; 65: 311-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this result indicates that the integrity of A2 is important to the high affinity binding of HK. To further investigate the role of PPK apple domain A2 for HK binding we cloned and recombinantly expressed single apple domains as fusion proteins with tPA in eukaryotic BHK cells (Fig. 2, left panel), and as fusion proteins with MBP in prokaryotic E. coli cells (Fig. 2, right panel). The purity of the affinity-purified fusion proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The recombinantly expressed proteins were essentially homogenous except for the tPA-A4 fusion where minor degradation products were observed (Fig. 2 A). The various apple fusions with tPA or MBP, the carrier proteins tPA and MBP, and β-kallikrein (control; not shown) were coated on microtiter plates and their binding capacity probed by unmodified HK. Bound HK was detected by a monoclonal antibody HKH14 specific for the HK heavy chain not involved in complex formation between HK and PPK. HK bound with highest affinity to immobilized apple domain A2 (set 100%) irrespective of the fusion partner or expression system used (Fig.2 B). The relative binding capacity to other apple domains was reduced to 39–40 (A1) and 48–52% (A4) whereas HK binding to A3 was essentially identical to background binding to the carrier proteins, tPA and MBP (Fig. 2 B). These findings are consistent with the notion that A2 plays a pivotal role in the binding of HK to PPK. In a previous study we have developed a panel of 20 monoclonal antibodies to"
https://openalex.org/W1991643413,"In the development and progression of sporadic tumors multiple tumor suppressor genes are inactivated that may be distinct from predisposing cancer genes. Previously, a tumor suppressor locus on human chromosome 13q14 that is distinct from the retinoblastoma predisposing gene 1 (RB1) has been identified in lung, head and neck, breast, ovarian and prostate tumors. By an approach that combines genomic difference cloning and positional cloning we isolated the cDNA of a novel gene (DICE1) located at 13q14.12-14.2. The DICE1 gene is highly conserved in evolution and its mRNA is expressed in a wide variety of fetal and adult tissues. The DICE1 cDNA encodes a predicted protein of 887 amino acids corresponding to an 100 kD protein that shows 92.9% identity to the carboxy-terminal half of the mouse EGF repeat transmembrane protein DBI-1. The DBI-1 protein interferes with the mitogenic response to insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) and is presumably involved in anchorage-dependent growth. When compared to normal lung tissue expression of the DICE1 mRNA was reduced or undetectable in the majority of non-small cell lung carcinomas analysed. The location of the DICE1 gene in the region of allelic loss, its high evolutionary conservation and the downregulation of expression in carcinoma cells suggests that DICE1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in non-small cell lung carcinomas and possibly in other sporadic carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2104375994,"Mutation of glutamate 62 to lysine in yeast transcription factor (TF) IIB (Sua7) causes a cold-sensitive phenotype. This mutant also leads to preferential transcription of downstream start sites on some promoters in vivo. To explore the molecular nature of these phenotypes, the TFIIB E62K mutant was characterized in vitro. The mutant interacts with TATA-binding protein normally. In three different assays, the mutant can also interact with RNA polymerase II and recruit it and the other basal transcription factors to a promoter. Despite the ability to assemble a transcription complex, the TFIIB E62K protein is severely defective in transcription in vitro. Therefore, the role of TFIIB must be more than simply bridging TATA-binding protein and polymerase at the promoter. We propose that the region around Glu-62 in yeast TFIIB plays a role in start site selection, perhaps mediating a conformational change in the polymerase or the DNA during the search for initiation sites. This step may be related to the yeast-specific spacing between TATA elements and start sites since mutations of the corresponding glutamate in mammalian TFIIB do not produce a similar effect.

An initial committed complex is formed by TBP/TFIID binding to the TATA element of a promoter (4Nakajima N. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4028-4040Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Subsequent interaction with TFIIB bridges TFIID on the TATA element and RNA pol II/TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH (5Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Several steps occur after transcription complex assembly, including promoter melting, start site selection and initiation, promoter clearance, elongation, and reinitiation. During the initiation process, numerous protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions must be established, adjusted, and then disrupted as the transcription machinery moves away from the start site. The mechanism of transcription start site selection is not well characterized. In higher eukaryotes, promoter melting and transcription initiation overlap at a fixed distance of ∼25 nucleotides downstream from a TATA box (6Corden J. Wasylyk B. Buchwalder A. Sassone-Corsi P.

Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar), suggesting that start site selection is simply due to the geometry of the transcription complex. In contrast, initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae generally occurs at multiple sites within a broad window of 30–120 nucleotides from TATA (8Guarente L. Annu. Rev.

Genetic methods have been applied to identify factors that affect start site selection in yeast cells. Mutations in TBP (spt15 alleles (12Winston F. Transcriptional Regulation.

In contrast to the spt mutations, which affect TATA element selection, the sua and shi mutations alter the spacing between the TATA element and initiation sites. Rather than causing completely novel initiation sites to be used, the mutations change the relative usage of normal initiation sites (i.e. strongly favoring upstream or downstream start sites). It is interesting to note that these mutations generally do not affect overall promoter strength and that many promoters are unaffected. In agreement with the genetic experiments, species-specific selection of transcription start sites in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe was specified in vitro by pairwise replacement of both TFIIB and pol II (19Li Y. Flanagan P.M. Tschochner H. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1994; 263: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TFIIB has two domains that correlate with its two known interactions. At the N terminus is a zinc ribbon domain that is essential for the pol II/TFIIF recruiting activity (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A proteolytically resistant C-terminal domain of TFIIB is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with the TBP·DNA complex (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ikura M. Cell. 1995; 82: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 26Zhu W.L. Zeng Q.D. Colangelo C.M. Lewis L.M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). However, a highly conserved region linking two domains does not appear in the structures and has been proposed to be a flexible “hinge” region. Although the N-terminal domain of TFIIB is absent from the x-ray structure of the DNA·TBP·TFIIBc complex, this domain is predicted to be close to the initiation site (27Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). TFIIB physically links TBP/TFIID and pol II/TFIIF and may thereby define the spacing between them. Some mutations in the TFIIB hinge region can dramatically affect the spacing between the TATA element and the initiation sites in vivo (13Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 28Pinto I. Wu W.-H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol.

This phenotype allowed the original isolation of the yeast TFIIB gene (SUA7) as a suppressor of upstreamATG codons (13Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these start site selection mutants also exhibit a cold-sensitive phenotype. In an attempt to characterize the role of TFIIB in transcription start site selection, we analyzed one of the Sua7 mutant proteins in vitro. Surprisingly, we found that the Sua7 E62K mutant can assemble transcription complexes normally, but is severely defective in transcription in vitro. These findings indicate that TFIIB is required not only for initial assembly of the transcription complex, but also for a later step in initiation such as promoter melting, start site selection, or promoter clearance. The purification of RNA pol II and TFIIH was described (30Cho E.-J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The Mono S (HR 5/5) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fractions obtained during the purification of TFIIH (30Cho E.-J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) were used for the purification of TFIIF. The fractions were assayed by immunoblot analysis using anti-Tfg2 polyclonal antibody. The TFIIF fractions were pooled and applied directly onto a Mono Q (HR 5/5) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.5m KOAc and protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm benzamidine HCl, 5 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The column was developed with a 15-ml gradient of 0.5–1 m KOAc in the same buffer. Fractions containing TFIIF, which eluted at ∼0.85 m KOAc, were pooled and dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 0.1 m KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 50% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors). The open reading frames of wild-type and E62K, G204D, and C45F mutant Sua7 genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction; cloned into pET-11d; and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS. The C-terminal truncation expression construct (Met-119 to the end) was generously provided by Song Tan (Pennsylvania State University). Each strain containing wild-type or mutant plasmid was cultured in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) at 30 °C. Cells were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.4 mm) when A600 nm reached 0.6. The preparation of extract and the purification of each recombinant protein were performed essentially as described for human TFIIB by Buratowski and Zhou (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the case of E62K and G204D, the full-length recombinant protein fraction also contained a truncation product that arises from the internal translation initiation at methionine 119 (31Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Bushnell D.A. Sayre M.H. Brickner J.H. Gileadi O. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27549-27553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To separate the full-length protein from this product, the S-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) eluate fraction was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.7), 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient to 240 mm potassium phosphate in the same buffer. A second round of hydroxylapatite chromatography was necessary for complete isolation of the full-length protein. The final hydroxylapatite eluate was further purified by Mono S (HR 5/5) fast protein liquid chromatography as described (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Proteins were monitored by Coomassie Blue staining and confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Human wild-type and E51A and E51R mutant TFIIB proteins were purified as described (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Yeast TBP was expressed and purified as described (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The purification of Gal4-VP16 was described (30Cho E.-J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). 200 ng of recombinant yeast TFIIB (wild type or the indicated mutants) was incubated with 400 ng of purified pol II in 200 μl of buffer A containing 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.03% Nonidet P-40 for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture also contained 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to preclear the reaction. After centrifugation to remove the beads, either preimmune serum or anti-Sua7 serum (1 μl) and a fresh aliquot of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to the reaction mixture. Incubation continued for another hour at room temperature. The beads were collected and washed five times with ice-cold buffer A plus 0.03% Nonidet P-40 (1 ml each time). The precipitate was resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Mouse monoclonal antibody 8WG16 against the C-terminal domain (CTD) of pol II (32Thompson N.E. Steinberg T.H. Aronson D.B. Burgess R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11511-11520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect RNA pol II. The 10–13-μl binding reaction mixture typically contained 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgOAc, 30–60 μg/ml poly(dG·dC), 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 1–3 × 104 cpm of probe. The Eco RI/Hin dIII fragment of pRW, which contains the adenovirus major late promoter TATA element and initiator, was used as a probe (5Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Protein components were added to the binding reaction as indicated. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30–50 min and loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mm Tris, 40 mm glycine, and 1 mmEDTA. Magnesium acetate (3 mm) was added to the gel in the experiment shown in Fig. 3 B. A typical binding reaction contained 10 ng of TBP, 30 ng of TFIIB, 80 ng of pol II fraction, and 25 ng of TFIIF fraction. Whole cell extracts were prepared from wild-type TFIIB cells (YSB143 = MAT a, ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, his3Δ200, sua7Δ::LEU2 (pRS313-SUA7)) or isogenic TFIIB E62K mutant cells (YSB176 = same genetic background as YSB143 but containing (pRS313-sua7-35)) as described by Woontner et al. (33Woontner M. Wade P.A. Bonner J. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4555-4560Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription was performed as described by Woontner and Jaehning (34Woontner M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8979-8982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 100 mm KOAc, 8–10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 unit of creatine kinase (Sigma), 10 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 10 units of rRNasin (Promega), 4 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mm each CTP and ATP, 10 μm UTP, 5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 0.5 mm3′-O-methyl-GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 60–80 μg of whole cell extract protein, and 200 ng of pGal4CG− (35Lue N.F. Flanagan P.M. Sugimoto K. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1989; 246: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). After a 50–60-min incubation at room temperature, reactions were stopped and processed with RNase T1 and proteinase K as described (34Woontner M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8979-8982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For single round transcription, extracts were incubated with template for 20 min in the transcription reaction buffer without NTPs to allow formation of PIC. For multiple round initiations, the NTPs were added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 20 min. For single round transcriptions, Sarkosyl (0.1 or 0.3% final concentration) was added 1.5 min after NTP addition and incubated for 10 min. The RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and analyzed on a 7m urea and 5% polyacrylamide gel. Reactions were supplemented, where indicated, with 100 ng of Gal4-VP16. Mammalian in vitro transcription was performed in a reconstituted system as described by Buratowski and Zhou (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Transcription template DNA was made by cutting pGal4CG− with Ehe I and Afl III. The Afl III site was filled with biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc.), dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP using Klenow fragment. Template DNA was then gel-purified. The 1.1-kilobase pair fragment contains one Gal4-binding site, the CYC1 promoter, and a G-less cassette. The biotinylated fragment was incubated with streptavidin-coupled M-280 Dynabeads (3–5 pmol of DNA/mg of streptavidin-coupled M-280 Dynabeads; Dynal Inc.) in buffer B (2 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40) at room temperature overnight. As a promoterless negative control, the Ehe I/Afl III fragment of p(C2AT)19 (36Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) was used. The DNA-bound beads were washed several times in buffer B and subsequently in Tris/EDTA buffer. The beads were preincubated with bovine serum albumin (0.05 mg/ml) and washed briefly right before use with simple transcription buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 100 mm KOAc, and 10% glycerol). Transcription initiation complexes were assembled on immobilized template DNA by incubation of 120 μg of whole cell extract with 3 μl of beads in 60 μl of simple transcription buffer. Hexokinase (2 units) and glucose (2 mm final concentration) were added to the mixture during the assembly reaction to deplete endogenous NTPs. After 40 min, the transcription complexes were magnetically purified and extensively washed with simple transcription buffer containing 0.003% Nonidet P-40. Beads were resuspended in either SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer directly or kinase reaction buffer (37Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The kinase reaction continued for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of sample loading buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoresed on a 4∼20% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). The proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies against TFIIB (anti-Sua7), TFIIE (anti-Tfa1), TFIID (anti-TBP), and TFIIH (anti-Tfb1, provided by W. J. Feaver and R. D. Kornberg) and monoclonal antibody 8WG16. Autoradiography was used to detect phosphorylated pol II. The yeast TFIIB allele sua7-1 contains a substitution of lysine for glutamate 62 (E62K) and was isolated as a suppressor of an aberrant ATG translation initiation site in the leader region of the CYC1 gene (13Pinto I. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Cell. 1992; 68: 977-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As a result of this single amino acid substitution, transcription initiation sites at some promoters are shifted downstream in vivo. In a search for conditional alleles of SUA7, we independently isolated E62K as a cold-sensitive variant. 2C. Dollard, H. Zhou, and S. Buratowski, unpublished data. To characterize the mechanism of transcription start site selection in vitro, whole cell extract was prepared from yeast strains expressing either wild-type or E62K mutant TFIIB. The transcription template (pGal4CG−) contains a single Gal4-binding site and the CYC1 TATA element upstream of a 400-bp G-less cassette (35Lue N.F. Flanagan P.M. Sugimoto K. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1989; 246: 661-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In wild-type extracts, two major in vitro transcription initiation sites are apparent (Fig.1, lane 1). In contrast to its in vivo behavior, E62K replacement greatly reduced in vitro transcription activity at the CYC1 promoter (Fig.1, lanes 2 and 3). The small amount of transcription supported by E62K was still responsive to the activator Gal4-VP16 (see below). PhosphorImager quantitation indicated that the mutant extracts produced ∼10–15-fold less transcript than the wild-type extracts. Since the E62K mutant in vivo causes a downstream shift in start site selection, the ratio of the two transcripts was quantitated. Surprisingly, the ratio was roughly the same in both extracts: ∼1.5 downstream transcripts to each upstream transcript. Transcription activity could be restored to the mutant extract by addition of recombinant wild-type TFIIB (Fig. 1, lanes 6 and 7). However, addition of excess amounts of recombinant E62K protein to the mutant extract did not increase transcription levels, suggesting that the defect was not due to low levels of TFIIB protein (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). The recombinant E62K protein also failed to support the transcription in a purified reconstituted transcription system (data not shown). We also tested several other promoters, including the adenovirus major late promoter (pMLΔ53(200) (38Buratowski S. Hahn S. Sharp P.A. Guarente L. Nature. 1988; 334: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)), the IgH promoter (pμ(−47)-G−-IV (39Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)), the IgH-adenovirus major late hybrid promoter (pμ(-47)-ML-(G−) (40Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22878-22886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), the PYK1 promoter (pPYKC/G−; gift from R. D. Kornberg), and his4-912δ (pLG80; gift from F. Winston). None of them were transcribed efficiently in the E62K mutant extract (data not shown). Based on these findings, we conclude that the TFIIB E62K mutant protein is intrinsically defective in at least one function required for normal transcription. Since E62K extracts are defective in transcription, one or more essential interactions within the transcription complex must be affected. TFIIB is known to interact directly with TBP and with pol II. To characterize the biochemical defect of E62K, two protein interaction assays were used: co-immunoprecipitation with pol II and native gel electrophoresis of partial transcription complexes. We also tested three additional mutant proteins with well characterized defects. C45F mutant TFIIB is mutated at a conserved cysteine residue within the zinc finger motif, and the “core” TFIIB is a complete deletion of this N-terminal domain. These mutants do not support viability in yeast (data not shown), and similar substitutions in mammalian TFIIB block interaction with pol II (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another mutant, G204D, causes a severe growth defect in yeast and is severely defective in the interaction with TBP, consistent with predictions from the DNA·TBP·TFIIB structure (27Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.2 A) showed that pol II could bind to the wild-type and E62K and G204D mutant TFIIB proteins. In contrast, the zinc finger mutant (C45F) and the N-terminal truncation mutant (core) were not able to precipitate pol II, consistent with other reports that the zinc finger region of TFIIB is necessary for pol II interaction (20Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5633-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 21Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X. Kim L.-U. Green M. Reinberg D.

Science. 1993; 261: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The interaction between E62K and pol II was not affected by lowering the temperature (Fig. 2 B). Therefore, the in vitro transcription defect and cold-sensitive phenotype of E62K cannot be attributed to a defect in pol II interaction. We next used native gel electrophoresis to determine whether E62K and the other mutant proteins were able to interact with TBP and to recruit pol II and TFIIF to the promoter DNA. This system has previously been used to analyze mammalian transcription complexes (5Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 549-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). With yeast factors, complexes consisting of DNA·TBP·TFIIB (Fig.3 A) and DNA·TBP·TFIIB·pol II·TFIIF (Fig. 3 B) can be visualized. All the TFIIB proteins except for G204D were able to form the DNA·TBP·TFIIB complex, indicating that E62K is not defective in this interaction (Fig. 3 A). Formation of partial transcription complexes is visualized in Fig. 3 B. In Fig.3 B, 3 mm magnesium acetate was included in the gel and running buffer to destabilize nonspecific polymerase complexes. The DNA·TBP·TFIIB complex was not seen under these conditions. Both the wild-type and E62K mutant TFIIF proteins were able to form the DNA·TBP·TFIIB·pol II·TFIIF complex (Fig. 3 B). This complex was completely dependent upon the presence of TFIIF. The TFIIB mutant proteins defective in pol II interaction or TBP interaction were unable to form a DNA·TBP·TFIIB·pol II·TFIIF complex on the promoter. Therefore, the E62K mutant appears to be functional for recruitment of pol II and TFIIF to the promoter DNA. The native gel electrophoresis assay allowed observation of only partial transcription complexes, and therefore, it was possible that the TFIIB mutant might block the association of other transcription factors such as TFIIE or TFIIH. To look at complete transcription complexes assembled from whole cell extracts, we took the advantage of an immobilized template assay (30Cho E.-J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Wild-type or mutant extract was incubated with template DNA linked to magnetic beads. After incubation to allow transcription complexes to assemble, the beads were collected magnetically and washed extensively. The presence of basal transcription factors was assayed by immunoblotting, and phosphorylation of the pol II CTD by TFIIH was detected by autoradiography (Fig. 4 A). Assembly of the transcription complex was dependent on the presence of the promoter sequences (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 1 and 2) and was modestly stimulated by the presence of the activator Gal4-VP16. Interestingly, the transcriptionally inactive E62K extract assembled all the required transcription factors at the promoter. Upon addition of ATP, the transcription complexes containing the TFIIB E62K mutant also exhibited phosphorylation of the Rpb1 CTD. Therefore, the E62K mutant does not affect the ability of TFIIH to phosphorylate the CTD. To compare the immunoblot results with transcription activity, complexes assembled on immobilized template beads were washed extensively and then incubated in a transcription reaction (Fig.4 B). To test for the ability of transcription factors to exchange, a second template (pJJ460) was added along with the NTPs. Transcription from wild-type complexes was dependent upon an intact promoter and responded to the activator (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2–4). Trans"
https://openalex.org/W1993985212,"In Escherichia coli, DNA methylation regulates both origin usage and the time required to reassemble prereplication complexes at replication origins. In mammals, at least three replication origins are associated with a high density cluster of methylated CpG dinucleotides, and others whose methylation status has not yet been characterized have the potential to exhibit a similar DNA methylation pattern. One of these origins is found within the ∼2-kilobase pair region upstream of the human c-myc gene that contains 86 CpGs. Application of the bisulfite method for detecting 5-methylcytosines at specific DNA sequences revealed that this region was not methylated in either total genomic DNA or newly synthesized DNA. Therefore, DNA methylation is not a universal component of mammalian replication origins. To determine whether or not DNA methylation plays a role in regulating the activity of origins that are methylated, the rate of remethylation and the effect of hypomethylation were determined at origin β (ori-β), downstream of the hamster DHFR gene. Remethylation at ori-β did not begin until ∼500 base pairs of DNA was synthesized, but it was then completed by the time that 4 kilobase pairs of DNA was synthesized (<3 min after release into S phase). Thus, DNA methylation cannot play a significant role in regulating reassembly of prereplication complexes in mammalian cells, as it does in E. coli. To determine whether or not DNA methylation plays any role in origin activity, hypomethylated hamster cells were examined for ori-β activity. Cells that were >50% reduced in methylation at ori-β no longer selectively activated ori-β. Therefore, at some loci, DNA methylation either directly or indirectly determines where replication begins. In Escherichia coli, DNA methylation regulates both origin usage and the time required to reassemble prereplication complexes at replication origins.

However, as development progresses past the blastula stage, initiation of DNA replication begins to occur at specific sites (1Sasaki T. Sawado T. Yamaguchi M. Shinomiya T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 547-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hyrien O. Maric C. Méchali M. Science. 1995; 270: 994-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that initiation sites for DNA replication in cultured mammalian cells occur at specific genomic loci (3DePamphilis M.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For example, a 200-kb1 region at the human β-globin gene (4Aladjem M.I. Groudine M. Brody L.L. Dieken E.S. Fournier R.E. Wahl G.M. Epner E.M. Science. 1995; 270: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 5Kitsberg D. Selig S. Keshet I. Cedar H. Nature. 1993; 366: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and a 500-kb region at the mouse IgH gene (6Ermakova O.V. Nguyen L.H. Little R.D. Chevillard C. Riblet R. Ashouian N. Birshtein B.K. Schildkraut C.L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) are both replicated from a single initiation locus. Moreover, what previously had been viewed as random initiation events distributed throughout “initiation zones” in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and hamster cells more likely reflects the presence of several strongly preferred initiation sites (7Dubey D.D. Zhu J. Carlson D.L. Sharma K. Huberman J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3638-3647Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise size and composition of these initiation loci, as well as the parameters that define them remain the subject of intense investigation.The fact that specific sites for initiation of DNA replication can be developmentally acquired makes it clear that initiation sites in the metazoa are determined at least in part by epigenetic parameters. These parameters include nuclear structure, chromatin structure, and events that occur during G1 phase of the cell division cycle (reviewed in Ref. 3DePamphilis M.L. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, replication origins are determined by specific DNA sequences, although the precise nature of these sequences is not yet known. Initiation occurs at the same well defined sites within a large genetic locus that is present as a single copy per haploid genome as it does in cells that have amplified the locus into hundreds of copies (9DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Carroll S.M. DeRose M.L. Kolman J.L. Nonet G.H. Kelly R.E. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5931-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, each copy must contain specific cis-acting sequences that determine where replication can begin. Moreover, replication origins exhibit initiation activity when they are translocated to other chromosomal sites (13Aladjem M.I. Rodewald L.W. Kolman J.L. Wahl G.M.

The distal sequences may act as enhancers to alter chromatin structure, while the proximal sequences may act as assembly sites for prereplication complexes. Several reports of autonomously replicating sequence elements that function in mammalian cells and cell extracts have been documented in detail and shown to correspond to initiation sites for DNA replication in mammalian chromosomes (17Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 92-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells.

This does not exclude the possibility that, under appropriate conditions, other sequences may promote autonomous plasmid DNA replication in mammals (21Krysan P.J. Smith J.G. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as they do in Xenopus eggs (22Blow J.J. Chong J.P.J. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 971-982Google Scholar) and in yeast (23Kipling D. Kearsey S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).One mechanism by which chromatin structure or nuclear organization might affect origin activity is through DNA methylation at replication origins. In Escherichia coli, DNA methylation plays a direct role in regulating the efficiency of origin usage and the timing of origin activation (see “Discussion”). In mammals, two replication origins in hamster cells (24Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and one in human cells (32Araujo J.D. Knox F.D. Ramchandani S. Peletier R. Bigey P. Price G. Szyf M. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9335-9341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are associated with an unusually dense cluster of methylated CpG dinucleotides (CpGs) while other origins contain sufficient CpGs to generate a similar pattern of DNA methylation (24Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In one case (24Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), these CpGs were shown to be methylated in active origins as well as in the total cell population. Earlier reports that mammalian replication origins were associated with an unusual “densely methylated island” consisting of ∼100 to ∼500 base pairs in which all cytosines were methylated, regardless of their dinucleotide composition (25Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5636-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Tasheva E.S. Roufa D.J. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1995; 19: 369-383Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar), apparently resulted from incomplete DNA cleavage by methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases and incomplete reaction of DNA with bisulfite followed by selective amplification of unreacted DNA segments (24Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 27Rein T. Natale D.A. Gärtner U. Niggemann M. DePamphilis M.L. Zorbas H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10021-10029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).DNA methylation at mammalian DNA replication origins might affect initiation of DNA replication in at least two ways. First, DNA methylation might delay reinitiation at origins in mammalian cells, as it does in E. coli. For example, while newly replicated DNA appears to be rapidly remethylated throughout most of the genome (28Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,29Gruenbaum Y. Szyf M. Cedar H. Razin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4919-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), remethylation is delayed in as yet undefined parts of the genome for up to 6 h (30Woodcock D.M. Simmons D.L. Crowther P.J. Cooper I.A. Trainor K.J. Morley A.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 102-112Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These genomic regions may represent replication origins. Since the tumor suppressor p21WAF1 can disrupt the interaction between PCNA and DNA methyltransferase (31Chuang L.S.-H. Ian H.-I. Koh T.-W. Ng H.-H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar), p21 could potentially play a dual role at replication origins by regulating activation of prereplication complexes through control of Cdk2-cyclin A and E protein kinase activity and by delaying remethylation of newly synthesized DNA. Following the E. coli scenario, this would allow hemimethylated origin DNA to be sequestered by proteins that are sensitive to its methylation status, thus delaying reassembly of a prereplication complex.Alternatively, DNA methylation might promote specificity in the selection of initiation sites, because DNA methylation can alter DNA secondary structure (38Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 39Zacharias W. O'Connor T.R. Larson J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and 5-methylcytosine in DNA can bind specific proteins (40Nan X. Tate P. Li E. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 414-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), one of which (MeCP2) also binds to nuclear matrix (41Weitzel J.M. Buhrmeister H. Strätling W.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5656-5666Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These properties could alter chromatin structure to make some sites more or less accessible, or they could facilitate binding of DNA replication proteins. Support for this hypothesis comes from observations that induction of hypomethylation often advances the time when specific sequences are replicated during S phase (33Bickmore W.A. Carothers A.D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2801-2809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Jablonka E. Goitein R. Marcus M. Cedar H. Chromosoma. 1985; 93: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Selig S. Ariel M.

J. 1990; 265: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Vogel M.C.

Science. 1996; 271: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) at mid-G1 phase in the cell cycle.These considerations raised two important questions. First, is DNA methylation a feature common to all mammalian replication origins? Second, does DNA methylation play a role in regulating origin activity? To address the first question, we determined the methylation status of the human c-myc replication origin. This origin lies just upstream of the c-myc promoter and is located within a CpG island (17Berberich S. Trivedi A. Daniel D.C. Johnson E.M. Leffak M. J. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1887-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), typical of a class of replication origins that map to promoter regions of actively transcribed genes (18DePamphilis M.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 45-86Google Scholar) that replicate at the beginning of S phase (49Simon I. Cedar H. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication In Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 387-408Google Scholar). CpG islands are regions of ∼1 kb that contain more than 50% G and C residues and a ratio of observed/expected CpGs of greater than 0.6 (11Kelly R.E. DeRose M.L. Draper B.W. Wahl G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4136-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although CpG islands are considered devoid of 5-methylcytosine (50Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), attempts to evaluate the methylated state of these origins have so far relied either on methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases that sample only a small subset of cytosines (50Delgado S. Gomez M. Bird A. Antequera F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2426-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or on sequence analysis of only a small fraction of the total number of CpGs within the island (28Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These studies would not have detected a situation in which some of the CpGs within a CpG island are methylated, because they are associated with the replication origin. These studies also would not have detected a situation in which some cells within a population utilize the replication origin and are therefore methylated at this site, while other cells utilize the promoter and are therefore unmethylated at this site. Neither possibility would be detected without a complete sequence analysis for methylated cytosines in total genomic DNA and in newly replicated DNA where the methylated status of active replication origins is specifically revealed. Our results demonstrate that DNA methylation is not a component of all mammalian replication origins.To address the second question, we determined the rate of remethylation and the effect of hypomethylation at ori-β, a well characterized replication origin located within a large nontranscribed intergenic region in hamster cells. Our results demonstrate that the rate of remethylation in mammalian cells cannot play a significant role in regulating the rate at which prereplication complexes are reassembled, because origins are rapidly remethylated. Nevertheless, hamster cells containing hypomethylated DNA no longer exhibited site-specific initiation of DNA replication in the ori-β locus, revealing that DNA methylation does affect the initiation process at some origins. This could occur either directly by facilitating the binding or activity of replication proteins or indirectly by altering the concentrations of critical replication proteins.MATERIALS AND METHODSMapping Methylated Cytosines in Specific DNA SequencesThe bisulfite method was used to detect methylated cytosines at specific DNA sequences as described previously (24Rein T. Zorbas H. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For analysis of nascent DNA, 1 μg of ΦX174 DNA was added as carrier prior to bisulfite conversion.Isolation Of Newly Synthesized DNA from Early Replication BubblesNascent Strand LengthTo isolate nascent DNA of different lengths, CHO K1 cells were cultured and synchronized at their G1/S transition by a double aphidicolin block as described previously (8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The fraction of cells at their G1/S boundary was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to be >90%. DNA was labeled, extracted, fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and purified as described previously (8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), except that sucrose gradient fractions were collected that contained DNA from 400 to 4000 residues in length.Replication TimeTo isolate nascent DNA at different times after cells were released into S phase, cells synchronized at their G1/S transition were washed twice with prewarmed complete medium and then cultured for 14 min in complete medium before pulse-labeling nascent DNA for 1–2 min at 37 °C by the addition of 1 μm3H-labeled deoxycytidine and 100 μm 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Cells then were washed twice with prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and cultured in fresh prewarmed medium for 1 min to 6 h. DNA was isolated and purified as described previously (8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).c-myc Origin DNAHeLa cells were synchronized at their G1/S transition by serum starvation and aphidicolin arrest as described for CHO K1 cells (8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cells were released into S phase for 10 min by washing twice with prewarmed medium before labeling nascent DNA for 5 min with BrdUrd. Cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium for another 4 h. Chromosomal DNA was extracted and digested with restriction endonucleases (8Kobayashi T. Rein T. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3266-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nascent Br-DNA then was affinity-purified and reacted with bisulfite. Alternatively, nascent DNA was isolated from synchronized HeLa cells and fractionated according to size by gel electrophoresis after sedimentation through two sequential cesium chloride gradients as described previously (20Trivedi A. Waltz S.E. Kamath S. Leffak M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONA role for DNA methylation in the regulation of DNA replication in mammalian cells was suggested two decades ago based on the E. coli paradigm (57Taylor J. Molineux I. Kohiyama M. DNA Synthesis: Present and Future. Plenum Press, New York1978: 149-159Google Scholar). The E. coli origin of chromosome replication, ori-C, is a 245-bp region containing 11 GATC sites (58Oka A. Sugimoto K. Takanami M. Hirota Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) that are methylated at the N-6 position of adenine by deoxyadenosine methyltransferase (59Geier G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1408-1413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Antequera F. Tamame M. Villanueva J.R. Santos T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8033-8036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Control of replication timing within each cell is critically dependent on the level of deoxyadenosine methyltransferase (61Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The activity of both ori-C and the closely related ori-R in bacteriophage P1 is regulated by methylation on two levels: sequestration of hemimethylated origin DNA through SeqA (62Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and severely reduced origin activity in unmethylated DNA (63Abeles A. Brendler T. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7801-7807Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). When ori-C is replicated, the GATC sequences within ori-C become hemimethylated (64Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M.

Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) through association with SeqA protein (62Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). SeqA inhibits both the formation and activity of prepriming complexes (62Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 66Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N.

Methylation at ori-C also influences the local DNA structure and stability (62Brendler T. Abeles A. Austin S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 66Lu M.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 673-719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hemimethylated ori-C is refractory to further initiation events (73Messer W. Bellekes U. Lother H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1327-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 74Russell D.W. Zinder N.D. Cell. 1987; 50: 1071-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 75Smith D.W. Garland A.M. Herman G. Enns R.E. Baker T.A. Zyskind J.W. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) due to the inability of DnaA protein to access ori-C (76Landoulsi A. Malki A. Kern R. Kohiyama M. Hughes P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), thus preventing premature reinitiation when free DnaA levels are still high (64Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M. Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 65Campbell J.L. Kleckner N.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1053-1060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). OriC persists in this hemimethylated/sequestered state for ∼8 min, or about 10 times longer than for most other sites on the E. coli chromosome (64Ogden G.B. Pratt M.J. Schaechter M. Cell. 1988; 54: 127-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 65Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar).Thus, although deoxyadenosine methyltransferase is not required for E. coli cell proliferation, the methylation status at replication origins in E. coli regulates both origin efficiency and the rate at which replication origins can be reused. In fact, GATC sites and the dam methylation system are conserved among enteric bacteria, suggesting that this form of regulation is widespread (77Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is not universal, since it is absent from Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas. An analogous situation may exist in eukaryotes.DNA Methylation at Mammalian Replication OriginsOne would not expect DNA methylation to be universally required for initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes, because mammals appear to use the same proteins for assembly of prereplication complexes as do yeast and flies, and th"

We have shown previously that reduced wild-type p53 binds strongly to supercoiled DNA (scDNA) regardless of the presence or absence of p53CON. Here we compare the effects of oxidation of p53 by azodicarboxylic acid bis[dimethylamide] (diamide) and other agents on p53 binding to p53CON and to scDNA. Oxidation decreases the binding of p53 to scDNA; however, under conditions where binding to p53CON in a DNA fragment is completely abolished, some residual binding to scDNA is still observed. Increasing the concentration of oxidized p53 confers minimal changes in p53 binding to both scDNA and p53CON. Reduction of the oxidized protein by dithiothreitol neither restores its binding to DNA nor to p53CON in DNA fragments. In the presence of excess zinc ions, oxidation of p53 is, however, reversible. We conclude that the irreversibility of p53 oxidation is due, at least in part, to the removal of intrinsic zinc from its position in the DNA binding domain accompanied by a conformational change of the p53 molecule after oxidation of the three cysteines to which the zinc ion is coordinated in the reduced protein.

Mutated p53 was found in about 50% of human malignancies. The majority of these mutations maps to the p53 core domain, which is responsible for sequence-specific binding to the p53 consensus sequence 5′-RRRC(A/T)(T/A)GYYY-3′ (where R is a purine nucleoside, and Y is a pyrimidine nucleoside) separated by 0–13 base pairs. p53 is a transcription factor involved in maintaining the integrity of the genome. p53 responds to DNA damage by promoting cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (2Cox L.S.

The activity of the DNA binding domain in the full-length protein is modulated by other domains in the protein. Deletion of the C terminus produces a p53 molecule that is considered to be constitutively active for sequence-specific DNA binding (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

The role of the basic C terminus of p53 (amino acids 363–393) in regulating DNA binding has been the subject of several studies.

Curran T. Xanthoudakis S. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 558-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) that the redox/repair protein Ref-1 is a strong activator of p53 for DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, the C terminus of p53 may play a role in negative regulation of sequence-specific DNA binding by the protein central domain. Negative regulation of p53 also occurs by binding of the oncoprotein mdm2 to the transactivation domain of p53 (19Ciechanover A. Shkedy D. Oren M. Bercovich B. J. Biol.

On the other hand, oxidized and reduced protein forms showed no difference in the nonspecific DNA binding and in binding to mismatched DNA in gel mobility shift assays (26Hainaut P. Butcher S.

Hydrogen peroxide treatment of cells resulted in a decrease in the ability of p53 to bind to p53CON and to transactivate target genes in vivo (28Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that wild-type human p53 protein (expressed in insect cells) is strongly bound to scDNA1 at native superhelix density (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) both in the presence and absence of p53CON in the DNA molecule. Binding of p53 to scDNA resulted in full or partial relaxation of DNA as demonstrated by scanning force microscopy images. In competition assays p53 showed a preference for scDNA as compared with linear double-stranded DNA containing p53CON. On the other hand, thermally denatured DNA was efficient in competing for the binding of p53 to scDNA. These results suggested that interactions involving both the core domain and the C-terminal domain may regulate the binding of p53 to scDNA. In this paper, we compare the effect of p53 oxidation on binding of the protein to scDNA and to p53CON in linear DNA fragments. We show that oxidation strongly decreases but does not completely abolish the ability of p53 to bind to scDNA under conditions when binding to p53CON is completely abolished. We also show that oxidation of p53 by diamide, which has been considered to be an irreversible process, may become reversible under certain conditions. pBSK(−) and pPGM1 (a derivative of pBSK(+) containing 20-mer p53CON (AGACATGCCTAGACATGCCT)) were prepared as described (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fragments of the same plasmids generated with restriction endonuclease Pvu II (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) were purified by electrophoresis in low gel temperature agarose (Bio-Rad) followed by phenol/chloroform deproteination and ethanol precipitation (32Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Denatured DNA was prepared by heating calf thymus or plasmid DNA (pBSK(−) or pBR322) at 100 °C for 6 min followed by quenching on ice. Human wild-type p53 protein was expressed in a baculoviral system in insect cells and isolated and purified as described previously (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The p53 concentration was determined with the protein dye binding procedure according to Bradford, with bovine serum albumin as a standard (33Paleček E. Brázdová M. Černocká H. Vlk D. Brázda V. Vojtěšek B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3617-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Free p53 protein or p53·DNA complexes (prepared as described below) were treated with diamide (Sigma) or other reagents (concentrations and other details indicated in figure legends) in 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100 (pH 7.6) at 0 °C for 30 min. The reduced form of p53 was incubated with 2 or 5 mmDTT (Sigma) in parallel experiments. DNA (400 ng of whole plasmid or 70 ng of isolated fragments) was added to the pretreated p53 samples to a final volume of 20 μl at p53/DNA molar ratios between 1 and 15 (calculated from the concentrations of DNA molecules and p53 tetramers) and incubated for 30 min on ice followed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose (Bio-Rad) gel in 30 mm Tris, 30 mmH3BO3, 0.7 mm EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) at 120 V and 4 °C for 3–4 h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose transfer membrane Protran R (Schleicher & Schuell) or nylon membrane Hybond N+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 3m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate (pH 7.0) under 80 millipascals on a vacuum blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was blocked by 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline. p53 was detected with primary monoclonal antibody DO-1 (supernatant diluted 1:5–1:15) and secondary antibody anti-mouse IgG (alkaline phosphatase conjugate, Sigma) diluted 1:1000. p53 bands were visualized with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Sigma). p53 was measured using an EG&G PAR 263A potentiostat/galvanostat connected to a Metrohm 663 VA stand electrode in hanging mercury drop electrode mode. The following settings were used for the differential pulse voltammetric measurements: accumulation time 90 s, accumulation potential −0.6 V, scan rate 10 mV s−1, step potential 5 mV, pulse amplitude 50 mV. p53 was incubated with zinc ions at a given concentration (up to 0.1 mm) for 20 min on ice in 5 mm Tris, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100. Diamide was added, and the samples were incubated for another 20 min, followed by a 20 min incubation in a 2-fold molar excess (related to diamide) of DTT. In some experiments, the order or concentrations of the above reagents was altered. Finally, the excess of Zn2+ ions was removed by 1 mm EDTA. After 20 min, DNA was added, and the p53·DNA complexes were allowed to form for 30 min on ice. For other details, see Figs. 4 and 5. Since Zn2+ and diamide were present in reaction mixtures, we examined the possibility of interactions between these two compounds by voltammetry and obtained negative results. Diamide was used in a 5- to 50-fold excess over zinc, and no significant effect of diamide concentration was observed; the diamide-zinc interaction was, thus, not further considered.Figure 5Protection of p53 against the diamide-induced irreversible loss of specific binding to p53CON in pPGM1 DNA fragments (lanes 5–9) and nonspecific binding to pBSK(−) fragments (lanes 11–15) by zinc ions.

The complex of pBSK(−) scDNA with reduced p53 produced at p53/DNA = 5 retarded bands 1–4 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) with maximal intensity in bands 1 and 2 containing 15 and 17% of total monomeric scDNA, as estimated from densitometric tracing, and the fastest band 0 of the free (protein-unbound) scDNA corresponding only to 14% of total monomeric scDNA in the DNA sample free of p53. We used diamide to oxidize the sulfhydryl groups in the p53 protein (27Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar) and found that its effect on p53 binding to scDNA did not depend on concentration between 0.2 and 5 mm diamide. Incubation of oxidized p53 with scDNA yielded only two retarded bands, a well developed band 1 and a weak, smeared band 2 (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). Band 0 corresponded to 42% of total monomeric covalently closed circular DNA; this band was much more intense than the sc band obtained with reduced p53 (lane 2). p53 protein was blotted and detected on a membrane using the antibody DO-1 (Fig. 1 B), which maps to amino acids 20–25 of the N-terminal domain of p53 (34Stephen C.W. Helminen P. Lane D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 58-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 35Vojtesek B. Bártek J. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 151: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). A superimposition of the immunoblot with the ethidium-stained gel (Fig. 1 C) showed four bands corresponding to ethidium-stained bands 1–4 obtained with reduced p53 and an additional (slowest) band 5 detectable on the blot but not on the gel. No band on the blot corresponded to band 0 on the gel (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with our assumption that band 0 is due to scDNA free of p53 protein (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). No free p53 was detected on the blot, suggesting that almost all reduced p53 protein was bound to DNA. On the other hand, an appreciable amount of the free p53ox was detected with oxidized protein (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The band of p53ox on the blot matching the ethidium-stained band 1 was more intense, whereas band 2 was weaker (Fig. 1, A–C, lane 4) than the respective bands of reduced p53 (lane 2); a weak band 3 was observed on the blot (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) but not on the gel (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). These results suggest that oxidation of p53 with diamide results in a decrease in its affinity to scDNA but does not completely abolish this binding. Parks et al. (28Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that increasing the concentration of reduced murine p53 resulted in enhanced protection of p53CON sequence, whereas increasing the concentration of oxidized p53 conferred minimal protection to p53CON in the DNase I footprinting of supercoiled DNA. Considering our finding (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that (reduced) p53 binds preferentially to scDNA, their results (28Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) can be taken as evidence for the ability of reduced p53 to bind to p53CON in scDNA and of a decrease in this ability in p53ox. We studied the effect of increasing the concentration of p53ox on its binding to pBSK(−);i.e. to scDNA not containing p53CON (Fig. 1, A–C). With reduced p53, increasing the p53/DNA ratio from 5 to 10 resulted in a greater retardation of the bands and appearance of an intense band migrating more slowly than the band of relaxed DNA on the ethidium-stained gel (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 and 3). At p53/DNA = 10, a marked increase in intensities of the well resolved bands was observed on the blot (Fig. 1, inset in panel B, lane 3); these bands matched well with the respective ethidium-stained bands (Fig.1 C, lanes 2 and 3). In addition to a strong band 5, a weaker band 6 was observed on the blot that was not detectable by the ethidium staining (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). Increasing of p53ox/DNA from 5 to 10 also produced greater retardation of the DNA bands, but the bands were smeared both on the ethidium-stained gel and on the blot (Fig. 1, A–C, lanes 4 and 5). At p53ox/DNA = 15, the smear strongly prevailed over hardly detectable bands (Fig. 1, A–C, lane 6). The amount of free p53 observed on the blot (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 4–6) increased with increasing p53ox/DNA; no free p53 was detected on the blot of reduced p53 (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 2 and 3). A similar experiment was performed using the isolated 474-base pair DNA fragment containing p53CON (instead of scDNA) in the presence of a 7-fold weight excess of calf thymus DNA (to reduce nonspecific binding of p53 to the fragment at high protein/DNA ratios). With reduced p53, we obtained a retarded band R at p53/DNA = 5 (Fig. 1, D and E). With oxidized protein at p53ox/DNA = 5, no band R appeared, and the band of the (protein-free) 474-bp fragment was much stronger than that obtained with reduced p53. Increasing the p53ox/DNA up to 15 did not produce any retarded band. These results suggest that increasing the concentration of p53ox does not improve the ability of the protein to bind to p53CON (Fig. 1, D and E) (in agreement with Parks et al. (28Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) and to scDNA not containing p53CON (Fig. 1, A–C). At lower p53/DNA ratios, differences between the effect of p53 oxidation on binding to scDNA on one hand and to p53CON in linear DNA fragment on the other hand was observed; at p53/DNA = 2.5 or 1, p53ox produced at least one retarded band of p53·DNA complex, whereas under the same conditions p53ox did not bind to p53CON (data not shown). This suggests that the binding of p53 to scDNA may be less affected by p53 oxidation than binding to p53CON in a linear DNA fragment. It has been shown (27Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar, 28Parks D. Bolinger R. Mann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1289-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that p53 oxidized on air is unable to bind p53CON in a DNA 21-mer, but the DNA binding activity of the protein can be restored by the addition of DTT. However, oxidation of p53 with diamide prevented the DNA binding even in the presence of 5 mm DTT. Preformed complexes of p53 with p53CON-containing DNA oligomers were partially resistant to diamide at concentrations sufficient to oxidize the free protein and cancel its DNA binding activity (27Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar). Using scDNA of pBSK(−) (not containing p53CON), we obtained similar results. Our experiments also indicated that the presence of an excess of DTT protected p53 against oxidation with diamide. On the contrary, binding of diamide-oxidized p53 was not improved by the addition of DTT. The effects of diamide on free protein and on p53 bound in a complex with scDNA were compared (Fig. 2). The diamide treatment of p53·DNA complexes produced a smaller effect than the same treatment of free p53, as detected both on the ethidium-stained gel (Fig. 2 A) and on the immunoblot (Fig.2, B and C). As compared with diamide-untreated DNA·p53 complexes (Fig. 2, lane 2), the bands in diamide-treated samples were more diffuse and smeared (Fig. 2, lane 4); such a pattern suggests a reduced stability of the diamide-treated complex, which continuously decomposes during electrophoresis. Other oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, osmium tetroxide, potassium permanganate, and sodium hypochlorite at 1 mmconcentrations) were also tested for their influence on p53-scDNA binding. With the exception of NaClO, treatment of free p53 with these agents completely abolished the ability of p53 to bind scDNA. Treatment with hypochlorite produced a retarded band 1 (data not shown). When these agents were applied to the preformed p53·scDNA complex under the given conditions, only permanganate fully abolished the DNA binding activity of p53; NaClO, OsO4, and a complex of OsO4 with 2,2′-bipyridine produced partial inhibition of the p53 binding, whereas H2O2 displayed virtually no effect. No significant difference was observed in the binding of diamide-oxidized p53 to scDNA containing (pPGM1) and not containing the consensus sequence (Bluescript) (Fig. 3). We have previously shown (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) that single-stranded (ss) DNA is a strong competitor for binding of (reduced) p53 to pBSK(−) scDNA. Here we tested p53 oxidized with diamide for its binding to supercoiled pBSK(−) and pPGM1 DNAs using ss calf thymus DNA or pBSK(−) DNA as a competitor. Compared with reduced p53, the oxidized protein produced a smaller number of retarded bands on binding to scDNAs detectable both on an ethidium-stained gel (Fig. 3 A) and on the blot (Fig.3 B, lanes 2, 4, 7, and 9). On the addition of thermally denatured calf thymus DNA (mass ratio ssDNA/scDNA = 0.5), these bands were completely eliminated (lanes 5 and 10). Reduced p53 yielded the same result with pBSK(−) scDNA (lane 3), whereas pPGM1 retarded band 1 on the ethidium-stained gel (Fig. 3 A) and on the blot was resistant to competition of ssDNA (Fig. 3 B, lane 8), in agreement with the assumption that band 1 is due to binding of reduced p53 to p53CON (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Binding of p53 to ssDNA was clearly observed on the blot (Fig. 3), suggesting that both the reduced and oxidized forms of p53 bind to ssDNA. When denatured pBSK(−) was used as the competitor, similar results were obtained (not shown). In some experiments involving p53 binding to DNA oligomers (e.g. 28), the supercoiled DNA was used as competitor. The results contained in this and in our previous papers (31Paleček E. Vlk D. Stankova V. Brázda V. Vojtesek B. Hupp T.R. Schaper A. Jovin T.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Paleček E. Brázdová M. Černocká H. Vlk D. Brázda V. Vojtěšek B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3617-3625Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) showing specific binding properties of scDNAs should be therefore considered prior to the use of scDNA as a competitor; it cannot be excluded that reinterpretation of some earlier data will be necessary. In agreement with previous data (27Hainaut P. Milner J. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4469-4473PubMed Google Scholar), loss of DNA binding activity of baculovirus-expressed full-length human wild-type p53 due to its oxidation with diamide (concentration range between 0.2 and 10 mm) was irreversible and was not reverted by the addition of an excess of DTT. This conclusion could be made from the results obtained with sc pBSK(−) DNA (Fig. 4, lane 4) as well as with a linear p53CON-containing DNA fragment (Fig. 5, lane 4). This irreversibility might be due (a) to a deeper oxidation of sulfhydryl groups (as opposed to formation of disulfidic bonds), (b) to a release of zinc ion from the DNA binding domain resulting from oxidation of the three sulfhydryl groups to which the metal ion is coordinated, and (c) to an irreversible change in protein conformation due to protein oxidation (possibly related to b). To test possibility a, we examined p53 treated with 1 mm diamide, performic acid, KMnO4, or OsO4 by voltammetry with a mercury electrode in a solution containing cobalt ions (36Tomschik M. Havran L. Fojta M. Paleček E. Electroanalysis. 1998; 10: 403-409Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 37Brdicka R. Collect. Czech. Chem. Commun. 1933; 5: 112-128Crossref Google Scholar, 38Paleček E. Pechan Z.

Academic Press, Inc., New York1991: 205-213Google Scholar). This voltammetric/polarographic method is known to provide a sensitive test for the presence of cysteine/cystine residues in proteins (Refs. 38Paleček E. Pechan Z. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 42: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Olafson R.W. Olsson P.E. Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods in Enzymology. 205.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, Chichester, UK1983: 65-155Google Scholarand references therein). Cystine and cysteine residues yield the same voltammetric effect, because the disulfidic groups are reduced at the electrode to sulfhydryl groups at less negative potentials than the potential of the measured catalytic current produced by the cysteine residues. Oxidation of p53 with 5 mm diamide yielded a voltammetric curve identical to that obtained with p53 before its oxidation (Fig. 7), suggesting that the oxidation of cysteine with diamide did not proceed further than to a disulfidic group. Treatment of p53 with performic acid (known to oxidize sulfhydryl groups to sulfonic acid) with potassium permanganate (Fig. 7) and with osmium tetroxide (not shown) resulted in strong depression of the catalytic currents, suggesting deeper oxidation of sulfur in the protein. Similar results were also obtained with bovine serum albumin used as a control (not shown). To test possibilities b and c we assumed that the irreversible loss of DNA binding might be prevented by the presence of abundant zinc ions in solution during the oxidation or reduction steps. When 20–100 μm zinc was added to p53 before incubation with 1 mm diam"

Neither RAP nor Ni2+ blocked the binding of125I-α2M* to α2MSR on insulin- or buffer-treated cells, but they both blocked binding to LRP/α2MR. Insulin significantly increased LRP/α2MR mRNA levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Insulin-augmented125I-α2M* binding to macrophages was severely reduced by wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, SB203580, or rapamycin. The increase in α2MSR receptor synthesis was reflected by augmented generation of IP3 and increased [Ca2+]i levels upon receptor ligation. Incubation of macrophages with wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, SB203580, rapamycin, or antibodies against insulin receptors before insulin treatment and α2M* stimulation significantly reduced the insulin-augmented increase in IP3 and [Ca2+]i levels. Pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide blocked the synthesis of new α2MSR.

LRP/α2MR is a scavenger receptor (Kd ∼5 nm) that binds multiple structurally and functionally diverse ligands besides α2M*, including Pseudomonas exotoxin A, lipoproteinase lipase, apolipoprotein E-enriched lipoproteins, urokinase, and tissue-type plasminogen activator alone or in combination with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and lactoferrin (2Chu C.T.

These observations were later confirmed by others (37Gliemann J. Sonne O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 845: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 38Corvera S. Graver D.F. Smith R.M. J.

In the present study, we have studied the effect of insulin on expression of macrophage LRP/α2MR and α2MSR by the following parameters: 1) binding of125I-α2M* to high (α2MSR) and low (LRP/α2MR) affinity binding sites on the cells and generation of second messengers, namely IP3 and Ca2+; 2) RAP and Ni2+ sensitivity of binding of125I-α2M* to α2MSR and LRP/α2MR on buffer- or insulin-treated cells; 3) sensitivity of 125I-α2M* binding and second messenger generation to PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and p70s6k inhibitor rapamycin; and 4) LRP/α2MR receptor mRNA levels. Based upon these criteria, we report here that insulin appears to regulate the expression of macrophage LRP/α2MR and α2MSR in a coordinate manner.

In experiments where insulin effects were studied on α2M*-induced changes in IP3 levels, the cells were treated with insulin at the specified concentrations or time periods, and insulin was washed out with HHBSS before stimulating with α2M*. In studies where the effects of cycloheximide, actinomycin D, genestein, or staurosporin were studied on changes in IP3 in cells pretreated with insulin followed by stimulation with α2M*, these agents were added at the specified concentration and incubated for the specified time period at 37 °C prior to the addition of insulin or buffer. The effects of wortmannin, LY294002, PD98059, SB203580, or rapamycin also were examined on insulin-augmented increased IP3 formation of α2M*-stimulated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2151037552,"Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) declines in cells that accumulate an excess of polyamines, the downstream products of the enzyme. Superfluous production of polyamines is thus prevented. In animal cells, polyamines reduce ODC activity by accelerating its degradation. Similar down-regulation of ODC activity has been observed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but induced degradation has not been documented. Here we show using pulse-chase analysis that the loss of enzyme activity is the result of increased degradation of ODC. Polyamines reduce the half-life of the newly synthesized protein from 3 h to approximately 10 min. Degradation of bulk ODC pools is also accelerated by polyamines, but the absolute rate of turnover is slower, with a half-life of 5 h in untreated and 1 h in treated cells. Newly synthesized ODC polypeptide thus undergoes a process of maturation that renders it relatively resistant to both basal and polyamine-induced degradation. Proteasome mutants have a blunted or absent regulatory response, implicating both the core protease and the regulatory cap of the proteasome in induced degradation of yeast ODC. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) declines in cells that accumulate an excess of polyamines, the downstream products of the enzyme. Superfluous production of polyamines is thus prevented. In animal cells, polyamines reduce ODC activity by accelerating its degradation. Similar down-regulation of ODC activity has been observed in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but induced degradation has not been documented. Here we show using pulse-chase analysis that the loss of enzyme activity is the result of increased degradation of ODC. Polyamines reduce the half-life of the newly synthesized protein from 3 h to approximately 10 min. Degradation of bulk ODC pools is also accelerated by polyamines, but the absolute rate of turnover is slower, with a half-life of 5 h in untreated and 1 h in treated cells. Newly synthesized ODC polypeptide thus undergoes a process of maturation that renders it relatively resistant to both basal and polyamine-induced degradation. Proteasome mutants have a blunted or absent regulatory response, implicating both the core protease and the regulatory cap of the proteasome in induced degradation of yeast ODC. ornithine decarboxylase open translational reading frame yeast ornithine decarboxylase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 The enzymes that control polyamine metabolism share a common characteristic: the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)1 (1Hayashi S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13423-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) depends in large part on post-translational mechanisms. This property has perhaps been documented most fully for ODC of animal cells (1Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Coffino P. Peters J.-M. Finley J.R.H.D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell. Plenum Press, New York1998: 411-427Crossref Google Scholar). ODC catalyzes the initial step in the biosynthesis of polyamines, small, ubiquitous, abundant, and essential cellular polycations (5Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 749-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar). When these rise to excess levels, the half-life of the enzyme becomes shorter, and its steady-state level falls. This sequence of events provides a form of feedback regulation whereby the end products of the biosynthetic pathway limit the activity of the initial enzyme of the pathway. A second protein, termed antizyme, controls the process. Production of antizyme requires a translational frameshift to align a small upstream ORF with a second ORF that encodes all known functions of the protein. Polyamines greatly enhance frameshifting, and thus control the level of antizyme (6Matsufuji S. Matsufuji T. Miyazaki Y. Murakami Y. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Hayashi S. Cell. 1995; 80: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Antizyme associates with ODC, disrupting the homodimeric enzyme and rendering it inactive. The ODC:antizyme heterodimer thus formed is degraded by the proteasome (7Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). ODC represents an unusual substrate for the proteolytic action of the proteasome. Proteasomes act predominantly on proteins that have been modified by covalent association with multiple copies of the protein ubiquitin (8Baumeister W. Walz J. Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar), but accelerated ODC degradation depends instead on 1:1 stoichiometric noncovalent association with antizyme (9Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Li X. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2377-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the mechanism of regulation of ODC (yODC) is less well understood. However, many key attributes are similar to those observed in animal cells (11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Augmenting polyamines reduces yODC activity and protein, without changing the amount of yODC mRNA; changes in transcription or yODC mRNA stability are therefore implausible as mechanisms of control. Polyamines do not change the distribution of yODC mRNA on the polyribosomes, implying that translation is unaltered. Expression of the yODC open reading frame without flanking regions of the mRNA confers activity that remains under the control of polyamines, suggesting that the protein itself is subject to control (11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Degradation of yODC in response to polyamines subsists as the most probable explanation both because it is not excluded by the data and because animal cells utilize this mechanism. Direct evidence for this conclusion has, however, proven elusive. In yeast, genetic evidence has demonstrated that the proteasome digests yODC (13Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Elias S. Bercovich B. Kahana C. Coffino P. Fischer M. Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Ciechanover A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but polyamine excess has not been shown to influence this process. Here we provide evidence that polyamines accelerate the degradation of yODC by the proteasome in yeast.DISCUSSIONAs described in “Introduction,” previous findings suggested that cellular polyamines reduce yODC activity and protein by accelerating the degradation of the enzyme. However, the low level of expression of yODC has impeded direct measurements of stability. We constructed well regulated cells with augmented yODC expression and produced highly specific antiserum (“Experimental Procedures”). These technical tools made it possible to measure changes in the level of immunoreactive yODC and to perform pulse-chase analysis to measure its rate of turnover. We found that polyamine treatment greatly reduces the amount of yODC and diminishes the half-life of newly synthesized yODC, reducing it from about 3 h to 10 min. These changes in degradation were not associated with altered synthesis; using a short pulse labeling time of 3 min, polyamines were found to cause no consistent alteration in metabolic labeling of yODC. This result is consistent with that previously found in animal cells (26van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Brabant M. Sittler A. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5484-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to exclude small changes in translation rate, it is clear that the bulk and perhaps all of the polyamine-induced change in yODC activity results from a post-translational process. This is in contrast to the fungus Neurospora crassa, in which polyamines exert a repressive influence on ODC by reducing the abundance of ODC mRNA (27Williams L.J. Barnett G.R. Ristow J.L. Pitkin J. Perriere M. Davis R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Previous investigations of yODC stability employed inhibitors of synthesis, predominantly cycloheximide, to assess the rate at which activity falls when synthesis of proteins is halted (11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies showed that by this measure of stability, yODC has a half-life of more than an hour, regardless of whether or not polyamines are augmented. These results are only apparently discrepant with those reported here. Two models could reconcile these results with ours. Model 1 asserts that yODC is subject to accelerated degradation only or predominantly during a brief period after translation, perhaps before the newly synthesized polypeptide folds into an enzymatically active conformation. In that case, steady-state pools of enzymatically active yODC, those that are determined in cycloheximide chase experiments, would be predominantly in a matured form no longer susceptible to rapid degradation. Experiments using inhibitors of synthesis would reveal little or no effect of polyamines on degradation. To directly test this, we carried out prolonged labeling to uniformly label yODC pools. Cells were labeled for 2.5 h before initiating a chase. At the end of the label period, most of the labeled yODC cohort present will have been synthesized more than an hour ago, a calculation based on an 3-h yODC half-life and a 2-h cell division time. These labeled yODC pools were then chased; at the time of initiation of the chase, cells were either treated with polyamines or left untreated. In long labeled cells not treated with polyamines, labeled yODC pools declined with a 5-h half-life. In polyamine-treated cells, the half-life was reduced to 1 h. Polyamines therefore accelerate degradation of long-labeled yODC 5-fold. These results show that model 1 is untenable.Model 2 offers a offers a different resolution of the apparent conflict between cycloheximide chase versus pulse-chase experiments: simultaneous treatment with polyamines and inhibitors of protein synthesis may prevent the production of a polyamine-induced protein required for accelerated degradation. This is the case in animal cells. There the more marked effect on ODC activity of treatment with polyamines alone, compared with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus polyamines (28Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 893-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is because of the polyamine-induced synthesis of the protein antizyme, which binds to ODC and accelerates its degradation. Cycloheximide prevents antizyme synthesis but allows pre-formed ODC to be degraded at a rate characteristic of an antizyme-independent process or one dependent on the lesser amount of antizyme present in cells with basal levels of polyamines. In yeast as well, cycloheximide plus polyamines produce changes in yODC activity identical to those seen with cycloheximide and slower than those seen with polyamines alone (12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, in yeast too, excess polyamines stimulate the synthesis of a protein responsible for degradation. In yeast, polyamine treatment produces similar kinetics of decline in yODC activity, regardless of whether or not cycloheximide treatment is superimposed an hour after polyamines are added (12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This too is consistent with the possibility that polyamines cause a protein to appear which accelerates degradation of yODC and which can persist if synthesis is later impeded. Model 2 is fully compatible with our data and that of others.Our attempts to obtain direct biochemical evidence for induction in yeast of a hypothetical functional analog of antizyme have, however, been unsuccessful. Such an analog is likely to act catalytically on its substrate, as does mammalian antizyme, and hence be present in cells in a still smaller amount than the already scarce yODC. This suggests that genetic approaches to its identification will likely prove more useful than attempts at biochemical isolation. Whatever the mechanism of yODC regulation, amounts greatly in excess of that normally present in the cell exceed its capacity (Ref. 11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2 C). As shown here, a modest degree of over-expression, about 3-fold normal, is compatible with full or near-full regulation. The nature of the component limiting regulatory capacity remains to be determined, as does its relationship with the hypothetical yeast antizyme analog.Proteasome mutations in either the catalytic 20 S core (29Mamroud-Kidron E. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Rom E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or 19 S regulatory cap (13Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) interfere with yODC degradation in cells with basal polyamine levels. The same mutations are here shown to strongly impede polyamine-induced reduction in yODC. Induced degradation as well as basal degradation therefore depends on the integrity of both these functional elements of the proteasome, the core, and regulatory cap. As both elements of the yeast proteasome are required in vitro for proteolysis of mouse and yeast ODC (14Elias S. Bercovich B. Kahana C. Coffino P. Fischer M. Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Ciechanover A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the proteasome itself is the agent of induced yODC degradation.The observed difference in polyamine-induced lability of “new”versus “aged” yODC is not because of the use of a 4-h polyamine pre-treatment before pulse-chase for the short label experiment, versus addition of polyamines at initiation of the chase in the long label experiment. A treatment period of 1 h is in fact sufficient to fully establish yODC lability. That 1 h suffices to establish lability is consistent with our data and that of others (Ref. 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 1 A) and directly supported by our observation that the short label experiment yields an identical result if a 1-h rather than 4-h pretreatment is used (data not shown). Hence the cellular conditions required to produce extreme lability of newly synthesized yODC had been established within one h. of inception of the chase in the long label experiment. At what point after synthesis does yODC become less susceptible to degradation? Compared with newly synthesized yODC, “mature” molecules degrade about 2-fold more slowly in untreated cells (half-life 3 h versus 5 h) and about 6-fold more slowly in polyamine-treated cells (half-life 10 min versus 60 min). We know little about the time scale over which maturation takes place because we compared cohorts of molecules labeled for very dissimilar times, 3 min or 2.5 h. The timing and mechanism of the transition of yODC from more to less degradation-susceptible, therefore, remain highly conjectural. The relevant transition could be associated with one or more of several steps: completion of polypeptide translation, folding to a native monomeric configuration, self-association of monomers to form the enzymatically active homodimer, or association with some other cellular component. Two decades ago, Wheatley et al. (30Wheatley D.N. Giddings M.R. Inglis M.S. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated using pulse-chase labeling of cultured mammalian cells that newly synthesized proteins are surprisingly labile. After a 5-min pulse with 3H-leucine, about one third of incorporated (acid precipitable) counts were hydrolyzed by cells within 1 h, a fraction that fell progressively as the labeling time was increased. This result was interpreted to indicate that a large class of nascent proteins are initially at high risk for degradation and then undergo time-dependent stabilization. It is possible that yODC represents but a special case of this general phenomenon.Is accelerated degradation sufficient to account for the reduction in yODC activity observed in cells exposed to high polyamine concentrations? This treatment causes activity to fall with a 1-h half-life (Ref. 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 1 A). Some of the reduction in activity is because of very fast degradation of newly synthesized yODC, functionally equivalent to a near cessation of synthesis. The remaining reduction in activity is the result of a change in the half-life of the bulk steady-state yODC pool from 5 h to 1 h, a new rate consistent with the rate of loss of enzymatic activity. Significantly, polyamines cause similar kinetics of decline in enzymatic activity and in long labeled yODC, implying that these are measuring different properties of a common molecular population. Degradation therefore accounts for loss of activity. The enzymes that control polyamine metabolism share a common characteristic: the regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC)1 (1Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 27-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 2Coffino P. Peters J.-M. Finley J.R.H.D. Ubiquitin and the Biology of the Cell.

Hence the cellular conditions required to produce extreme lability of newly synthesized yODC had been established within one h. of inception of the chase in the long label experiment. At what point after synthesis does yODC become less susceptible to degradation? Compared with newly synthesized yODC, “mature” molecules degrade about 2-fold more slowly in untreated cells (half-life 3 h versus 5 h) and about 6-fold more slowly in polyamine-treated cells (half-life 10 min versus 60 min). We know little about the time scale over which maturation takes place because we compared cohorts of molecules labeled for very dissimilar times, 3 min or 2.5 h. The timing and mechanism of the transition of yODC from more to less degradation-susceptible, therefore, remain highly conjectural. The relevant transition could be associated with one or more of several steps: completion of polypeptide translation, folding to a native monomeric configuration, self-association of monomers to form the enzymatically active homodimer, or association with some other cellular component. Two decades ago, Wheatley et al. (30Wheatley D.N. Giddings M.R. Inglis M.S. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1980; 4: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) demonstrated using pulse-chase labeling of cultured mammalian cells that newly synthesized proteins are surprisingly labile. After a 5-min pulse with 3H-leucine, about one third of incorporated (acid precipitable) counts were hydrolyzed by cells within 1 h, a fraction that fell progressively as the labeling time was increased. This result was interpreted to indicate that a large class of nascent proteins are initially at high risk for degradation and then undergo time-dependent stabilization. It is possible that yODC represents but a special case of this general phenomenon.Is accelerated degradation sufficient to account for the reduction in yODC activity observed in cells exposed to high polyamine concentrations? This treatment causes activity to fall with a 1-h half-life (Ref. 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 1 A). Some of the reduction in activity is because of very fast degradation of newly synthesized yODC, functionally equivalent to a near cessation of synthesis. The remaining reduction in activity is the result of a change in the half-life of the bulk steady-state yODC pool from 5 h to 1 h, a new rate consistent with the rate of loss of enzymatic activity. Significantly, polyamines cause similar kinetics of decline in enzymatic activity and in long labeled yODC, implying that these are measuring different properties of a common molecular population. Degradation therefore accounts for loss of activity. As described in “Introduction,” previous findings suggested that cellular polyamines reduce yODC activity and protein by accelerating the degradation of the enzyme. However, the low level of expression of yODC has impeded direct measurements of stability. We constructed well regulated cells with augmented yODC expression and produced highly specific antiserum (“Experimental Procedures”). These technical tools made it possible to measure changes in the level of immunoreactive yODC and to perform pulse-chase analysis to measure its rate of turnover. We found that polyamine treatment greatly reduces the amount of yODC and diminishes the half-life of newly synthesized yODC, reducing it from about 3 h to 10 min. These changes in degradation were not associated with altered synthesis; using a short pulse labeling time of 3 min, polyamines were found to cause no consistent alteration in metabolic labeling of yODC. This result is consistent with that previously found in animal cells (26van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Brabant M. Sittler A. Coffino P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5484-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although it is difficult to exclude small changes in translation rate, it is clear that the bulk and perhaps all of the polyamine-induced change in yODC activity results from a post-translational process. This is in contrast to the fungus Neurospora crassa, in which polyamines exert a repressive influence on ODC by reducing the abundance of ODC mRNA (27Williams L.J. Barnett G.R. Ristow J.L. Pitkin J. Perriere M. Davis R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Previous investigations of yODC stability employed inhibitors of synthesis, predominantly cycloheximide, to assess the rate at which activity falls when synthesis of proteins is halted (11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies showed that by this measure of stability, yODC has a half-life of more than an hour, regardless of whether or not polyamines are augmented. These results are only apparently discrepant with those reported here. Two models could reconcile these results with ours. Model 1 asserts that yODC is subject to accelerated degradation only or predominantly during a brief period after translation, perhaps before the newly synthesized polypeptide folds into an enzymatically active conformation. In that case, steady-state pools of enzymatically active yODC, those that are determined in cycloheximide chase experiments, would be predominantly in a matured form no longer susceptible to rapid degradation. Experiments using inhibitors of synthesis would reveal little or no effect of polyamines on degradation. To directly test this, we carried out prolonged labeling to uniformly label yODC pools. Cells were labeled for 2.5 h before initiating a chase. At the end of the label period, most of the labeled yODC cohort present will have been synthesized more than an hour ago, a calculation based on an 3-h yODC half-life and a 2-h cell division time. These labeled yODC pools were then chased; at the time of initiation of the chase, cells were either treated with polyamines or left untreated. In long labeled cells not treated with polyamines, labeled yODC pools declined with a 5-h half-life. In polyamine-treated cells, the half-life was reduced to 1 h. Polyamines therefore accelerate degradation of long-labeled yODC 5-fold. These results show that model 1 is untenable. Model 2 offers a offers a different resolution of the apparent conflict between cycloheximide chase versus pulse-chase experiments: simultaneous treatment with polyamines and inhibitors of protein synthesis may prevent the production of a polyamine-induced protein required for accelerated degradation. This is the case in animal cells. There the more marked effect on ODC activity of treatment with polyamines alone, compared with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus polyamines (28Murakami Y. Hayashi S. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 893-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is because of the polyamine-induced synthesis of the protein antizyme, which binds to ODC and accelerates its degradation. Cycloheximide prevents antizyme synthesis but allows pre-formed ODC to be degraded at a rate characteristic of an antizyme-independent process or one dependent on the lesser amount of antizyme present in cells with basal levels of polyamines. In yeast as well, cycloheximide plus polyamines produce changes in yODC activity identical to those seen with cycloheximide and slower than those seen with polyamines alone (12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that, in yeast too, excess polyamines stimulate the synthesis of a protein responsible for degradation. In yeast, polyamine treatment produces similar kinetics of decline in yODC activity, regardless of whether or not cycloheximide treatment is superimposed an hour after polyamines are added (12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This too is consistent with the possibility that polyamines cause a protein to appear which accelerates degradation of yODC and which can persist if synthesis is later impeded. Model 2 is fully compatible with our data and that of others. Our attempts to obtain direct biochemical evidence for induction in yeast of a hypothetical functional analog of antizyme have, however, been unsuccessful. Such an analog is likely to act catalytically on its substrate, as does mammalian antizyme, and hence be present in cells in a still smaller amount than the already scarce yODC. This suggests that genetic approaches to its identification will likely prove more useful than attempts at biochemical isolation. Whatever the mechanism of yODC regulation, amounts greatly in excess of that normally present in the cell exceed its capacity (Ref. 11Fonzi W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18110-18118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2 C). As shown here, a modest degree of over-expression, about 3-fold normal, is compatible with full or near-full regulation. The nature of the component limiting regulatory capacity remains to be determined, as does its relationship with the hypothetical yeast antizyme analog. Proteasome mutations in either the catalytic 20 S core (29Mamroud-Kidron E. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Rom E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) or 19 S regulatory cap (13Mamroud-Kidron E. Kahana C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) interfere with yODC degradation in cells with basal polyamine levels. The same mutations are here shown to strongly impede polyamine-induced reduction in yODC. Induced degradation as well as basal degradation therefore depends on the integrity of both these functional elements of the proteasome, the core, and regulatory cap. As both elements of the yeast proteasome are required in vitro for proteolysis of mouse and yeast ODC (14Elias S. Bercovich B. Kahana C. Coffino P. Fischer M. Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Ciechanover A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), it is very likely that the proteasome itself is the agent of induced yODC degradation. The observed difference in polyamine-induced lability of “new”versus “aged” yODC is not because of the use of a 4-h polyamine pre-treatment before pulse-chase for the short label experiment, versus addition of polyamines at initiation of the chase in the long label experiment. A treatment period of 1 h is in fact sufficient to fully establish yODC lability. That 1 h suffices to establish lability is consistent with our data and that of others (Ref. 12Tyagi A.K. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12156-12163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and Fig. 1 A) and directly supported by our observation that the short label experiment yields an identical result if a 1-h rather than 4-h pretreatment is used (data not shown).

The mouse PDCR cDNA contains an 892-base pair open reading frame and is predicted to encode a 292-amino acid protein with a deduced molecular mass of 31,298 Da that terminates in a consensus type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal. Purified recombinant PDCR protein was generated from Escherichia coli and catalyzed the NADPH-dependent reduction of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA with a specific activity of 20 units/mg. Enzymatic characterization followed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of the products revealed that PDCR converted Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA to a Δ3-enoyl-CoA but not to a Δ2-enoyl-CoA. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that PDCR is active on a broad range of Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoAs. Although the observed substrate preference was to Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA, PDCR was also active on a C22 substrate with multiple unsaturations, a result consistent with the role of peroxisomes in the oxidation of complex, very long chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids. The presence of a type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal Ala-Lys-Leu-COOH at the C terminus of PDCR suggested that this protein may be peroxisomal. We observed that tagged PDCR was efficiently transported to the peroxisome lumen in normal human fibroblasts but not in cells derived from a Zellweger syndrome patient with a specific defect in peroxisomal matrix protein import. We conclude that this protein resides within the peroxisome matrix and therefore represents the first mammalian peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to be characterized at the molecular level.

In addition, peroxisomes are able to degrade a variety of unsaturated fatty acids and thus must contain auxiliary enzymes such as Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, and Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The oxidation of fatty acids with an unsaturation at an even positioned carbon eventually leads to formation of a Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA, which cannot be oxidized by β-oxidation. Instead, the further oxidation of Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoAs requires the successive action of Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase to generate a Δ3-enoyl-CoA, and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase to convert this intermediate to a Δ2-enoyl-CoA that can re-enter the β-oxidation spiral (see Fig. 1) (2Kunau W.-H. Dommes P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The oxidation of fatty acids with pre-existing unsaturations at odd-positioned carbons would appear to be even simpler, with one round of β-oxidation converting the Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoA to a Δ3-enoyl-CoA and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase converting this to a Δ2-enoyl-CoA substrate for further oxidation (see Fig. 1) (3Stoffel W. Caesar H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1965; 341: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, studies have established that there also exists a Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase-dependent pathway for returning Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoAs to the core spiral (Fig.1) (4Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductases appear to play important roles in the oxidation of virtually all unsaturated fatty acids. Recent studies have identified mammalian genes that encode the peroxisomal Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (6Palosaari P.M. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2446-2449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (7Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpelainen S.H. Novikov D. Fitzpatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but the structural basis for peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase remains to be determined. However, genes encoding mammalian mitochondrial Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductases have been identified in both rat and humans (8Hirose A. Kamijo K. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Mizugaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Koivuranta K.T. Hakkola E.H. Hiltunen J.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and it is formally possible that the peroxisomal reductase mRNA could be generated from the same gene as the mitochondrial enzyme. In fact, such a mechanism is used to generate both peroxisomal and mitochondrial forms of Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (7Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpelainen S.H. Novikov D. Fitzpatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, another possibility is that the peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase is encoded by a distinct gene that has yet to be recognized. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel mouse gene, PDCR, and show that it encodes a peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. All sequence searches were performed using algorithms and data bases available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information web site. Mammalian homologues of the putative Caenorhabditis elegans peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (F53C11.3) were identified by TBLASTN searches of the human and mouse expressed sequence tag data bases. Two cDNA clones from the IMAGE consortium (1924380 and 1888282) corresponded to the mouse ESTs1AI316477 and AI286384(GenBankTM accession numbers) and appeared to contain the full-length open reading frame of murine PDCR cDNAs. This was determined by the ability of these ESTs to encode proteins that (i) shared significant sequence similarities over the N terminus of F53C11.3 and yeast Sps19p and (ii) contained an appropriately positioned ATG codon with a good match to the Kozak consensus for high efficiency translation initiation (10Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar, 11Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). These two clones were obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO), and the clone with the longer 5′-untranslated region (1924380) was sequenced in its entirety on both strands. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed with DNASTAR MegAlign software (Madison, WI) using the PAM250 substitution matrix. The Escherichia coli strain DH10B was used for the maintenance and amplification of all plasmids (12Grant S.G. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Hanahan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4645-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). All polymerase chain reactions were performed with a low error rate mixture of polymerases (Expand; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A full-length form of the mouse PDCR open reading frame was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the cDNA clone 1888282 as a template and the oligonucleotides MmPDCR.5 (5′-GAAGTCGACCATGGCCCAGCCGCCGCCCGACGTTG-3′) and MmPDCR.3 (5′-GAACGCGGCCGCGAATGCCTTTAATCCCAG-3′) as primers. These oligonucleotides append Sal I and Not I sites (underlined) at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the mouse PDCR open reading frame, respectively. The product of this polymerase chain reaction was digested with Sal I and Not I and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pT7-His6. pT7-His6 is a modified form of pET28A (Novagen, Inc.) that contains Xho I and Sal I sites in place of the Nhe I-Hin dIII fragment found in the parental vector. The sequence of the mouse PDCR open reading frame in pT7-His6 was confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing, and the resulting plasmid was denoted pT7-His6-PDCR. This plasmid allows for T7-driven expression of a form of mouse PDCR bearing an N-terminal hexahistidinyl extension in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). To generate the N-terminal c-myc-tagged form of the mouse PDCR open reading frame, the Sal I-Not I insert of pT7-His6-PDCR was excised and subcloned into Xho I and Not I sites of pcDNA3-N myc (13Jones J.M. Nau K. Geraghty M.T. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9216-9223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This plasmid allows for constitutive expression of an N-terminally c-myc-tagged form of mouse PDCR in mammalian cells. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was chosen for high level heterologous expression of the His6-PDCR protein. Specifically, several colonies from a plate of freshly transformed BL21(DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pT7-His6-PDCR were used to inoculate a 50-ml preculture of LB medium supplemented with 1% glucose and 25 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. This preculture was grown 12 h at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (300 rpm), at which time 20 ml of the preculture were used to inoculate 500 ml of 2YT medium supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin sulfate. This culture was grown with vigorous shaking for approximately 7 h at 18 °C until the A600 was approximately 0.4, at which time induction of protein expression was begun by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-galactothiopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The induced culture was grown for an additional 18 h under the same conditions. The induced cells were harvested at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C at the end of this period. The induced cells were resuspended in 50 ml of binding buffer (20 mm sodium-Pi (pH 7.8), 500 mmsodium chloride, and 5 mm benzamidine HCl) with 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and the cells were lysed by sonication (14Geisbrecht B.V.

Following cell lysis, a clarified extract was prepared by centrifuging the sonicate at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. This extract (50 ml) was diluted to 150 ml with binding buffer and was applied at 1.5 ml/min to a 2-ml bed of Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was previously charged with nickel (II) chloride and equilibrated in binding buffer at 18 °C. After the entire extract was applied, the resin was washed sequentially with 50 bed volumes of binding buffer at pH 7.8 followed by 50 bed volumes of binding buffer at pH 6.0. An imidazole step gradient in binding buffer at pH 6.0 was chosen to elute the bound proteins. Specifically, 2.5 column volumes of buffers containing imidazole at 50, 250, 350, and 500 mm were applied sequentially to the resin, and the individual eluents were collected. Proportional amounts of each fraction were analyzed by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the presence and purity of His6-PDCR (apparent Mr = 33,000). Fractions containing highly purified His6-PDCR (>95%) were removed, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to 5 mm final concentration, and the protein in each fraction was precipitated for storage by adding solid ammonium sulfate to 0.4 mg/ml. The purified, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation and stored under buffer at −70 °C until needed. Δ2-Enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase) from bovine liver (15Steinman H. Hill R.L.

All protein determinations were done by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Kinetic parameters (apparent Vmax and Km) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting using the Sigma plot program. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate to product per min.

Acyl-CoA thioesters were analyzed or purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a Waters μBondapak C18 column (30 cm × 3.9 mm) attached to a Waters gradient HPLC system. The absorbance of the effluent was monitored at 254 nm. Separation of different acyl-CoA thioesters was achieved by linearly increasing the acetonitrile/H2O (9:1 v/v) content of the 50 mmammonium-Pi buffer (pH 5.5) from 20 to 50% at a flow rate of 2 ml/min.

Standard immunofluorescence conditions involved fixing the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and then permeabilizing all cellular membranes in 1% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. For differential permeabilization experiments, the cells were fixed identically but permeabilized with 25 μg/ml digitonin for 2 min only. The tissue culture supernatant from mouse hybridoma line 1–9E10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as the source of the monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody. Guinea pig polyclonal anti-PMP70 antibodies were raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 18 amino acids of human PMP70 (21Gärtner J. Moser H. Valle D. Nat.

Mammalian peroxisomes are capable of oxidizing unsaturated fatty acids, and this process requires the enzymatic activity of Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. Although this activity has been detected in purified peroxisomes from mammalian sources (22Hiltunen J.K. Karki T. Hassinen I.E. Osmundsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16484-16493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dommes V. Baumgart C. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1984; 96: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the purification of this enzyme has proved difficult and has limited detailed mechanistic and molecular studies of mammalian peroxisomal β-oxidation. To understand the structural basis for mammalian peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity and to provide material for mechanistic studies of this enzyme, we initiated a computer-based search for genes that might encode such an enzyme. We attempted to identify the mammalian peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase gene by searching for mammalian genes that were capable of encoding proteins with significant sequence similarity to yeast peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, Sps19p (25Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpelainen S.H. Hartig A. Hiltunen J.K. Binder M. Dawes I.W. Hamilton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22140-22147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, our searches using the Sps19p sequence as a BLAST query versus the data base of expressed sequence tags identified only ESTs corresponding to the previously identified mammalian mitochondrial Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase gene. Therefore, we altered our search strategy and restricted our search to the recently completed C. elegans genome sequence. Three putative Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase genes were identified in C. elegans, and the sequences of their deduced products (C. elegans proteins T05C12.3, W01C9.4, and F53C11.3) were examined. These three proteins were all highly similar to Sps19p, with BLAST e values of e −27 to e −28. However, one of these, F53C11.3, contained a match to the consensus type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal, Ser-Lys-Leu-COOH (26Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), at its C terminus. The presence of the type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal indicated that F53C11.3 might represent the peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase of C. elegans, and we used the F53C11.3 sequence to rescan the data bases of human and murine expressed sequence tags. Once again, the majority of ESTs we identified corresponded to the previously characterized mammalian mitochondrial Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductases. However, we also identified expressed sequence tags representing a second gene (a gene we have designated PDCR) that also shared significant similarity to F53C11.3. Two murine ESTs encoded proteins that shared sequence similarity to the N terminus of both F53C11.3 and yeast Sps19p and the corresponding cDNA clones were obtained and characterized. Sequence analysis of the longer PDCR cDNA clone revealed the presence of a 2048-base pair cDNA containing a 5′-untranslated region of 121 base pairs, an 876-base pair open reading frame, and a 1451-base pair 3′-untranslated region (Fig. 2). The sequence of the PDCR open reading frame was confirmed by sequencing the second PDCR cDNA clone, which differed only in that it had a slightly shorter 5′-untranslated region. The deduced product of the PDCR gene is 292 amino acids long, has a predicted molecular mass of 31,298 Da, and has a pI of 9.4. Like Sps19p and F53C11.3, murine PDCR terminates in a match to the consensus type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (26Gould S.J. Keller G.A. Hosken N. Wilkinson J. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1657-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar), Ala-Lys-Leu-COOH. Furthermore, an amino acid alignment between mouse PDCR, C. elegans F53C11.3, and S. cerevisiae Sps19p demonstrates that these proteins share extensive sequence similarities across their lengths (Fig. 3), with mouse PDCR showing 32 and 41% identity to the C. elegans and S. cerevisiae proteins, respectively.Figure 3Amino acid alignment of mouse PDCR with putative C. elegans and S. cerevisiae homologues. Clustal amino acid alignment of mouse PDCR with the hypothetical C. elegans protein F53C11.3 and S. cerevisiae Sps19p is shown. Residues that are conserved in all three sequences are shown as white letters on a black background.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test the hypothesis that mouse PDCR encoded a protein with Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity, we subcloned the entire mouse PDCR open reading frame into the prokaryotic expression vector pT7-His6, expressed the His6-PDCR protein in E. coli, and purified the soluble, recombinant enzyme by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Fig.4). Analysis of the purified protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the protein was greater than 95% pure. As a first assessment of the enzymatic activity of recombinant PDCR, we employed a spectrophotometric method to monitor changes in the absorbance spectrum of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA following the addition of PDCR (Fig. 5). The characteristic spectrum of a Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA is shown in Fig. 5, spectrum 1, with major absorbance bands centered near 260 and 300 nm that are attributable to the coenzyme A and dienoyl thioester moieties, respectively. Addition of purified PDCR to the assay mixture resulted in the disappearance of the dienoyl thioester chromophore at 300 nm and a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm that reflects the oxidation of NADPH (Fig. 5, spectra 2–4). This result demonstrated that recombinant, purified mouse PDCR has intrinsic Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity. It has previously been observed that the enzyme catalyzed reduction of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-dienoyl-CoAs can result in either Δ3-enoyl-CoAs (25Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpelainen S.H. Hartig A.

Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mizugaki M. Kimura C. Nishimaki T. Yamamoto H. Sagi M. Nishimura S. Yamanaka H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 92: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the PDCR-catalyzed reduction of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA shown in Fig. 5 was expected to yield either Δ3-decenoyl-CoA, as observed for bovine and yeast reductases, or Δ2-decenoyl-CoA, as formed by the E. coli enzyme. To address the stereochemistry of the PDCR catalyzed reaction directly, the reduction product of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA was further characterized enzymatically, and the resulting products were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 6). As expected, the substrate Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA gave rise to a single peak on HPLC (Fig. 6 A). Following addition of both purified PDCR and NADPH, a second peak was detected and was assigned to Δ3-decenoyl-CoA because this compound did not serve as a substrate for purified crotonase (Δ2-enoyl-CoA hydratase) (Fig. 6 B). However, when purified Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase was added to the reaction mixture, a third compound, presumably Δ2-decenoyl-CoA, was detected (Fig. 6 C). This assignment was verified by the conversion of the putative Δ2-decenoyl-CoA to 3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA in the presence of crotonase (Fig. 6 D). Thus, the PDCR-catalyzed reduction of Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoAs gives rise to Δ3-enoyl-CoAs as previously observed for other eukaryotic Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductases (25Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpelainen S.H. Hartig A. Hiltunen J.K. Binder M. Dawes I.W. Hamilton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22140-22147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1984; 95: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As a final test of PDCR activity, the chain length specificity of purified PDCR was assessed with three substrates. The substrates chosen for this study were Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-hexadienoyl-CoA, Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA, and Δ2-trans,Δ4,Δ7,Δ10,Δ13,Δ16,Δ19-cis-docosaheptaenoyl-CoA. The apparent Km and Vmaxvalues for Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA, the best of the three substrates, were determined to be 6 μm and 20 units/mg, respectively (TableI). This Km value is similar to the value of 6.7 μm reported for the same substrate with the bovine reductase (27Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the Vmax of 20 units/mg is significantly higher than the value of 3.9 units/mg reported for the bovine enzyme (27Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that PDCR was active with substrates having acyl chains of 6 and 22 carbon atoms as well. However, the activities of PDCR toward these Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoAs were markedly lower, and the Km values were much higher than the corresponding values obtained with Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA as the substrate.Table IKinetic parameters of recombinant mouse Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductaseSubstrateKm1-aApparent kinetic constant determined at 0.1 mm [NADPH].Vmax1-aApparent kinetic constant determined at 0.1 mm [NADPH].Vmax/Kmμmunits/mgunits/μmmg2,4-Hexadienoyl-CoA10880.0742,4-Decadienoyl-CoA6203.332,4,7,10,13,16,19-Docosaheptanenoyl-CoA1-bAssay contained additionally 0.06% Triton X-100.15550.0321-a Apparent kinetic constant determined at 0.1 mm [NADPH].1-b Assay contained additionally 0.06% Triton X-100. Open table in a new tab The presence of a consensus type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal (Ala-Lys-Leu-COOH) at the C terminus of PDCR strongly suggested that this Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase was in fact a peroxisomal enzyme. To determine whether PDCR was located within peroxisomes, we modified the PDCR cDNA so that it encoded the 10 amino acid c-myc epitope tag at its N terminus and placed it downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3-N myc PDCR, was transfected into human skin fibroblasts. Three days later, the transfected cells were processed for double indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies specific for the c-myc epitope tag, and for the cytoplasmically exposed C-terminal tail of PMP70, an integral peroxisomal membrane protein (30Kamijo K. Taketani S. Yokata S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4534-4540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following permeabilization of all cellular compartments, we observed that N myc PDCR colocalized with PMP70 to discrete, punctate structures characteristic of peroxisomes (Fig.7, A and B). To determine whether N myc PDCR was transported into the peroxisome lumen, we repeated these experiments under differential permeabilization conditions that allow detection of proteins on the outer surface of peroxisome but not in the peroxisome lumen (Fig. 7, C and D) (31Swinkels B.W. Gould S.J. Bodnar A.G. Rachubinski R.A. Subramani S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3255-3262Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The inability to detect N myc PDCR under these conditions suggested that the protein was inside the peroxisome membrane, whereas the detection of cytosolic tail of PMP70 confirmed that the antibodies did detect cytoplasmically exposed antigens. Similar results were observed for the prototypic peroxisomal enzyme marker, catalase, thereby reaffirming the validity of the differential permeabilization protocol (Fig. 7, E and F). The hypothesis that PDCR is a peroxisomal matrix protein predicts that it should accumulate in the cytoplasm of cells that have a specific defect in matrix protein import. Zellweger syndrome is a lethal human disorder characterized by defects in peroxisomal matrix protein import and is caused by defects in any of at least 12 different genes, all of which play roles in peroxisome biogenesis. Previous studies have established that the cell line PBD100, which was derived from a Zellweger syndrome patient and has inactivating mutations in the PEX10 gene, is unable to import peroxisomal matrix proteins but has no apparent defect in the import of peroxisomal membrane proteins (20Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We transfected PBD100 cells with pcDNA3-N myc PDCR and processed these cells for double indirect immunofluorescence, again using antibodies specific for the c-myc epitope tag and for PMP70 (Fig. 7, G and H). The cytoplasmic accumulation of N myc PDCR in these cells, even though they are able to import PMP70 into the peroxisome membrane, supports the hypothesis that PDCR is a peroxisomal matrix protein. The work presented here describes the first molecular characterization of a mammalian peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase. The mouse cDNA encoding this enzyme (PDCR) was identified on the basis of its potential to encode a protein highly similar to S. cerevisiae Sps19p. Enzymatic characterization of PDCR demonstrated that this enzyme has significant, intrinsic Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity and that the product of its action on Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA was Δ3-decenoyl-CoA. Thus the catalytic mechanism of PDCR can be assumed to be analogous to other eukaryotic Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductases, which have previously been shown to reduce Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoAs to Δ3-enoyl-CoAs (25Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpelainen S.H. Hartig A. Hiltunen J.K. Binder M. Dawes I.W. Hamilton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22140-22147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 27Dommes V. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1781-1788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mizugaki M. Kimura C. Kondo A. Kawaguchi A. Okuda S. Yamanaka H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We observed that mouse PDCR displays a substrate preference for Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA over both Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-hexadienoyl-CoA and Δ2-trans,Δ4,Δ7,Δ10,Δ13,Δ16,Δ19-cis-docosaheptaenoyl-CoA based on the ratio of the observed Vmax and Km constants for these substrates. The observed preference for Δ2-trans,Δ4-trans-decadienoyl-CoA likely reflects the cellular role of PDCR in peroxisomal β-oxidation, namely in the oxidation of long and very long chain fatty acids that contain unsaturations near the middle of the acyl chain (1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Furthermore the observed activity of PDCR on Δ2-trans,Δ4,Δ7,Δ10,Δ13,Δ16,Δ19-cis-docosaheptaenoyl-CoA is consistent with the established role of peroxisomes in the metabolism of complex, very long chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid and prostaglandins (1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Using immunofluorescence microscopy we observed that mouse PDCR is targeted to the peroxisomal lumen. This experimental observation of peroxisomal localization is consistent with several lines evidence presented here and elsewhere. First, the presence of the C-terminal sequence Ala-Lys-Leu-COOH in PDCR suggested that this enzyme would be targeted efficiently to peroxisomes. This sequence represents a consensus match to the type-1 peroxisomal targeting signal, an obligatory C-terminal tripeptide motif that is present on the vast majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins (32Subramani S. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 445-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Second, we observed a distinct accumulation of PDCR in the cytoplasm of skin fibroblasts derived from a PEX10-deficient Zellweger syndrome patient. The molecular defects in these cells have been characterized at both the genetic and protein level, and it is well established that these cells are deficient in peroxisomal matrix protein import specifically (20Warren D.S. Morrell J.C. Moser H.W. Valle D. Gould S.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported previously that a homotetrameric Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase isolated from rat liver peroxisomes has a subunit molecular mass of approximately 33,000 Da (24Kimura C. Kondo A. Koeda N. Yamanaka H. Mizugaki M. J. Biochem. 1984; 96: 1463-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on the deduced protein sequence of PDCR, the calculated molecular mass of this novel enzyme is predicted to be 31,298 Da. Thus, the subunit mass of mouse PDCR is in good agreement with that of an orthologous enzyme isolated from peroxisomes of a highly related species. Mammalian cells contain differentially compartmentalized pathways for the β-oxidation of fatty acids and the chemical details of the individual steps in both mitochondrial and peroxisomal pathways appear highly similar. For example, both systems require the action of the auxiliary enzymes shown in Fig. 1 to completely oxidize unsaturated fatty acids. Although the enzymatic steps involved in metabolizing Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA intermediates are relatively well understood, the presence of two distinct shunts for degrading Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoAs raises questions as to which pathway is responsible for the main flux of carbon skeletons arising from such intermediates. Recent studies on the mitochondrial metabolism of Δ2-trans,Δ5-cis-octenoyl-CoA suggest that the hydratase/isomerase shunt handles a majority of the metabolic flux for these intermediates (33Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A corollary to this finding is that the reductase-dependent pathway is responsible for maintaining coenzyme A homeostasis in the presence of the unavoidable and possibly deleterious action of Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase on Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoAs (Fig. 1) (33Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Currently there is no report in the literature that addresses questions of metabolic flux for peroxisomal Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoAs. Thus, an assessment of these issues is needed to elaborate our general understanding of peroxisomal unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. These molecular studies of mouse peroxisomal Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase complete the preliminary characterization of the known auxiliary enzymes of mammalian peroxisomal β-oxidation. The significance of these studies is underscored by the well established observation that defects in peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism are directly linked to lethal inherited human disorders (34Wanders R.J. Jansen G. van Roermund C.W. Denis S. Schutgens R.B. Jakobs B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As of this report four genetically distinct complementation groups of these peroxisomal disorders have been described (34Wanders R.J. Jansen G. van Roermund C.W. Denis S. Schutgens R.B. Jakobs B.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although two complementation groups are attributable to defects in acyl-CoA oxidase and thed-specific multifunctional enzyme, the precise enzymatic deficiency in the remaining complementation groups is unknown. 2R. J. A. Wanders, personal communication. Because Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase activity is required for complete oxidation of all Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoAs, as well as a portion of Δ2,Δ5-dienoyl-CoAs, the human form of PDCR represents a candidate disease gene for these disorders. In addition to these uncharacterized complementation groups of peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation deficiency, there also exist reports of a lethal human deficiency in Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (35Roe C.R. Millington D.S. Norwood D.L. Kodo N. Sprecher H. Mohammed B.D. Nada M. Schulz H. McVie R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1703-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 36Kimura M. Yamaguchi S. Ryoikibetsu Shokogun Shirizu. 1998; 18: 411-413Google Scholar). Interestingly, the molecular basis of this deficiency has yet to be resolved. Although one group suggested that the defect lies in a mitochondrial Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (35Roe C.R. Millington D.S. Norwood D.L. Kodo N. Sprecher H. Mohammed B.D. Nada M. Schulz H. McVie R. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1703-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), no report describing patient mutations in a gene encoding a mitochondrial Δ2,Δ4-dienoyl-CoA reductase exists in the literature, and the possibility that this deficiency is peroxisome-associated has not been examined.

Recent studies have demonstrated a role for RAP as a molecular chaperone for the LDL receptor-related protein during receptor folding and trafficking within the early secretory pathway. In the present study, we investigated a potential role for RAP as a chaperone for the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, another member of the LDL receptor gene family. Using intracellular cross-linking techniques, we found that RAP is associated with newly synthesized VLDL receptor. In the absence of RAP co-expression, newly synthesized VLDL receptor exhibited slower trafficking along the early secretory pathway, most likely due to misfolding of the receptor. The role of RAP in the folding of the VLDL receptor was further studied using an anchor-free, soluble VLDL receptor. Metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments showed that while only 3% of the soluble VLDL receptor was folded and secreted in the absence of RAP co-expression, over 50% of the soluble receptor was secreted in the presence of RAP co-expression. The functions of RAP in VLDL receptor folding and trafficking were mediated by its carboxyl-terminal repeat but not by the amino-terminal and central repeats. Using truncated VLDL receptor constructs, we identified the RAP-binding site within the first three ligand-binding repeats of the VLDL receptor. Thus, our present study demonstrates that RAP serves as a folding and trafficking chaperone for the VLDL receptor via interactions of its carboxyl-terminal repeat with the three amino-terminal ligand-binding repeats of the VLDL receptor.

Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar and 2Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar). Common structural features of these receptors include 1) cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats (LBR), 2) epidermal growth factor precursor homology repeats, 3) spacer regions that include YWTD repeats, 4) a single transmembrane domain, and 5) a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail with one or two copies of the NP X Y motifs, which serve as potential endocytosis signals. The most striking difference among these receptors is the number of LBR. The LDL receptor and the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, both with an approximate molecular mass of 130 kDa, contain seven and eight LBR, respectively, whereas the much larger 600-kDa LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) has 31 LBR arranged in four distinct clusters (3Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Yamamoto T. Davis G.C.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4119-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar). Each LBR consists of approximately 40 amino acids that include six cysteine residues, which form three disulfide bonds (8Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Russell D.W. Schneider W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). As shown with LBR 1, 2, and 5 of the LDL receptor, these disulfide bonds are formed between cysteines I and III, II and V, and IV and VI (9Bieri S. Djordjevic J.T. Daly N.L. Smith R. Kroon P.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13059-13065Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These disulfide bonds, along with calcium ions (10Fass D. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Berger J.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 691-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), appear to play an important role in stabilizing the structure of the receptor. Whether identical structural arrangements are present within the LBR of other members of the LDL receptor gene family remains to be elucidated but appears to be highly likely due to their sequence homology and functional similarities. Studies with LRP and its minireceptors indicate that intramolecular disulfide bond formation is of crucial importance for the proper folding and trafficking of the receptor within the early secretory pathway (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 13Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a 39-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) associates with LRP upon receptor synthesis and assists the folding and trafficking of the receptor (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As the receptors reach the medial Golgi compartments, where post-translational oligosaccharide modifications become endoglucosidase H (Endo H)-resistant, RAP dissociates from the receptor as a result of decreased pH. RAP is then retrieved back to the ER, while the receptor is transported to the cell surface (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of RAP co-expression, high molecular weight aggregates of misfolded LRP are seen when analyzed under nonreducing SDS-PAGE. These aggregates are probably due to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds during misfolding, since these aggregates are reduced to monomers when analyzed under reducing conditions (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 13Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting folding, RAP also regulates ligand binding to LRP as a means of preventing premature ligand interactions with the receptor within the early secretory pathway (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 16Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have shown that RAP binds strongly to and prevents ligand binding of all known ligands to LRP, megalin/LRP2, and the VLDL receptor (3Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J.

In contrast, binding of RAP to the LDL receptor is much weaker, and inhibition of ligand binding to this receptor requires higher concentrations of RAP (21Mokuno H. Brady S. Kotite L. Herz J. Havel R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13238-13243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While recombinant RAP has been used experimentally as a receptor antagonist, this protein is not present extracellularly under normal physiological conditions (22Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) due to the presence of an ER retention signal at its carboxyl terminus (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,15Bu G.J. Rennke S. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, RAP consists of relatively homologous triplicate repeats of about 100 amino acid residues (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP is the only repeat that promotes the folding and trafficking of LRP, while both the amino-terminal and the central repeats are able to inhibit the binding of certain ligands (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). While the LDL receptor and LRP are highly expressed in the liver, the VLDL receptor is virtually absent therein (6Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y. Nakai T. Sakai J. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9252-9256Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 23Webb J.C. Patel D.D. Jones M.D. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Hum. Mol.

Soutar A.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), brain, and kidney (26Jokinen E.V. Landschulz K.T. Wyne K.L. Ho Y.K. Frykman P.K. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26411-26418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression pattern of the VLDL receptor resembles that of lipoprotein lipase, the major enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of triacylglycerides in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (for a review, see Ref. 27Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, it was hypothesized that the VLDL receptor was involved in lipoprotein metabolism (6Takahashi S.

Iijima H. Sakai J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Studies in RAP knockout mice have indicated that RAP may play a role in the biogenesis of the VLDL receptor, since VLDL receptor transport to the cell surface was completely blocked in heart muscle cells of RAP−/− mice (16Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The objective of the current study was to investigate whether RAP serves as a molecular chaperone during the folding and trafficking of the VLDL receptor, and if so to identify the structural basis for RAP-VLDL receptor interaction. We found that interaction between the carboxyl-terminal repeat of RAP and the three amino-terminal repeats of the VDLD receptor plays important role in the folding and trafficking of this receptor. Construction of cDNAs for sLRPs using polymerase chain reaction has been described previously (13Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The same strategies were used for generating constructs for the human VLDL receptor and for the following constructs of truncated human VLDL receptor: LBR 1–8 (i.e. full-length VLDL receptor), LBR1–3, LBR 1–5, LBR 6–8. All of these constructs contained a HA tag inserted after the cleavage site. The cDNA for the full-length human VLDL receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Tokuo Yamamoto (Tohoku University, Japan). A construct of RAP and the properties of the RAP repeats have been described previously (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cDNA construct for RAP lacking the HNEL ER retention sequence was described before (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Human glioblastoma U87 cells, human hepatoma HepG2 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEF-4 (LDLR−/−, LRP−/−) and MEF-7 (RAP−/−) cells were cultured as described before (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Obermoeller L.M. Chen Z. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22374-22381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). MEF-4 and MEF-7 cells were obtained from Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). For transient transfection, cells were transfected with various plasmids (total 45 μg of cDNA/100-mm plate in a total volume of 16.5 ml) at 20–30% confluence using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (30Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Sixteen hours after the start of transfection, cells were washed with medium and cultured for an additional 24 h before the experiment. For generating stable cell lines, CHO-LRP(−/−) cells (31FitzGerald D.J. Fryling C.M. Zdanovsky A. Saelinger C.B. Kounnas M. Winkles J.A. Strickland D. Leppla S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), were transfected with the respective pcDNA construct and selected for resistance to Geneticin (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Clones were then screened with anti-HA antibody, and positive clones expressing proteins of the correct size were then expanded and used for experiments. Metabolic labeling with [35S]cysteine (0.2 mCi/ml) and intracellular cross-linking with dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; 0.5 mm) were essentially performed as described before (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 30 or 60 min followed by a chase for 1, 2, or 3 h, as described in each experiment. For continuous labeling cells were labeled for 3 or 4 h, with no chase period, as indicated. Polyclonal anti-RAP and anti-LRP and monoclonal anti-HA antibodies have been described previously (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-VLDL receptor antibody was raised against a recombinant fragment of the VLDL receptor that contains all of the ligand-binding domains. Immunoprecipitation was essentially carried out as described previously (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation in the absence of SDS was carried out as described by Bu et al. (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Protein-IgG complexes were precipitated with protein A-agarose beads (Repligen Corp., Cambridge, MA), and the immunoprecipitated material was released from the beads by boiling each sample for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). If immunoprecipitated material was to be analyzed under reducing conditions, 5% β-mercaptoethanol was included in the Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with the percentage of polyacrylamide indicated in each figure legend. Rainbow molecular weight markers from Bio-Rad were used as molecular weight standards. Quantitation of bands on gels was performed using PhosphorImager analysis techniques on a STORM 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Reported values are mean values ± S.D. (n ≥ 3). To test whether RAP is associated with the VLDL receptor intracellularly, we examined if RAP could be cross-linked to the VLDL receptor in intact cells. U87 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for the human VLDL receptor and RAP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfected cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine at 37 °C for 4 h. After labeling, cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with phosphate-buffered saline, in the absence or in the presence of 0.5 mm of the membrane-permeable, thiol-cleavable cross-linker DSP (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed; immunoprecipitated with anti-VLDL receptor, anti-LRP, or anti-RAP antibodies; and analyzed via SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (Fig.1 A) or reducing conditions (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of the cross-linker, the polyclonal anti-VLDL receptor antibody precipitated a single band of ∼130 kDa, the expected size of the VLDL receptor (3Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S. Chappell D.A. Strauss III, J.F. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23268-23273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Polyclonal anti-LRP antibody immunoprecipitated a high molecular weight band corresponding to the size of LRP (lane 2). No cross-reactivity was observed between the VLDL receptor and LRP antibodies under these conditions. In the presence of the intracellular cross-linker DSP, in addition to the monomeric VLDL receptor band, anti-VLDL receptor antibody also immunoprecipitated high molecular weight complexes probably representing the VLDL receptor cross-linked to RAP (lane 4). High molecular weight complexes were also observed after cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with anti-LRP antibody when analyzed under nonreducing conditions (lane 5) (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, these high molecular weight complexes disappeared when analyzed under reducing conditions, which reduce the cross-linker and thus dissociate cross-linked proteins (Fig.1 B). As seen in Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 3, in the absence of cross-linker, anti-RAP antibody immunoprecipitated neither the VLDL receptor nor LRP. Due to the lack of cysteine in its sequence, RAP itself is not labeled in these experiments. However, in the presence of cross-linker, anti-RAP antibody immunoprecipitated both the VLDL receptor and LRP, suggesting that these proteins were associated with RAP at the time DSP was added (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 6). Taken together, these results indicate that within intact cells, RAP is associated not only to LRP but also to the VLDL receptor. To facilitate immunoprecipitation of different variants of the VLDL receptor via a monoclonal anti-HA antibody, a HA epitope was introduced near the amino terminus of each VLDL receptor construct. To ensure that the HA epitope did not affect the receptor's association with RAP, we transiently transfected U87 cells with cDNAs encoding the HA-tagged VLDL receptor and RAP. The experiment described in Fig. 1 was then repeated exactly as described, except for the use of the monoclonal anti-HA antibody in place of the polyclonal anti-VLDL receptor antibody. The results were identical to those obtained and described above, indicating that addition of the HA epitope on the VLDL receptor had no influence on its interaction with RAP (data not shown). To examine the potential role of RAP in the proper folding and trafficking of the VLDL receptor within the early secretory pathway, we analyzed the kinetics of the VLDL receptor trafficking in the absence or presence of RAP co-expression. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA for the VLDL receptor with co-transfection of either pcDNA3 or cDNA for RAP. Transfected cells were then metabolically pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and chased for 0, 1, or 2 h. After each chase period, cells were lysed and quantitatively immunoprecipitated with either polyclonal anti-VLDL receptor antibody or monoclonal anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Initially, after 30 min of labeling, a single band of labeled protein was observed in the absence of RAP co-expression (Fig.2 A, lane 1). After 2 h of chase, 26% of the labeled proteins appears as a slower migrating band (Fig. 2 A, lane 5). Treatment of immunoprecipitated material with 1.0 milliunits of Endo H indicates that the lower band, which is Endo H-sensitive, represents the ER form of the receptor. Co-expression of RAP significantly promotes the conversion of the Endo H-sensitive ER form to the Endo H-resistant Golgi form (Fig. 2 B). After 2 h of chase, 44% of labeled VLDL receptor had been processed into the Golgi-form, indicating that processing of the VLDL receptor is facilitated by RAP co-expression. When samples from identical experiments were analyzed under nonreducing conditions, a broader, fuzzier band was observed in the absence when compared with in the presence of RAP. A likely explanation for this observation is that misfolding of the VLDL receptor in the absence of RAP co-expression is due predominantly to mislinkage of disulfide bonds within the receptor molecule, which slightly alters the VLDL receptor molecules' mobility on SDS-PAGE. This result is distinct from that observed with LRP in which the mislinkage of disulfide bonds primarily occurs between LRPs (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that RAP promotes proper folding and intracellular trafficking of the VLDL receptor. We have also noted that the conversion of the ER to the Golgi form of the VLDL receptor appears to differ between different cell lines. Pulse-chase analysis with U87 cells (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), instead of HepG2 cells as described above, consistently resulted in a major ER band and a much weaker, sometimes absent, Golgi band of the VLDL receptor. This suggests that various cell types may process the VLDL receptor differently during the post-translational processing and trafficking. However, cell surface iodination studies suggest that only the Golgi form, and not the ER form, traffics to the cell surface (data not shown). In previous studies with sLRP minireceptors (encoding each of the four ligand binding domains but lacking the transmembrane domain), it was shown that co-expression of RAP is required for proper folding and secretion of sLRP2, sLRP3, and sLRP4 (13Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To examine whether secretion of a soluble VLDL receptor was dependent on RAP co-expression, we transiently transfected U87 cells with cDNA for a soluble VLDL receptor encoding the eight ligand binding repeats and the first two epidermal growth factor precursor repeats, with co-transfection of cDNA for the vector, pcDNA3, or RAP. The transfected cells were then pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 1 h and chased for 3 h (Fig.3 A). Both culture media and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing or nonreducing conditions and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. As seen in Fig. 3, A and C, less than 3% of the soluble VLDL receptor is secreted to the media in the absence of RAP co-expression (lane 2), compared with about 50% when RAP is co-expressed (lane 4). This indicates that RAP significantly promotes proper folding and secretion of the soluble VLDL receptor. Similar to sLRP (13Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), when analyzed under nonreducing conditions, high molecular weight aggregates, corresponding to dimer, trimer, and multimers, were observed in the absence of RAP co-expression (data not shown). The three internal triplicate repeats (about 100 amino acids each) of the 323-amino acid RAP share high sequence homology (14Obermoeller L.M. Warshawsky I. Wardell M.R. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10761-10768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate which RAP repeat(s) facilitate VLDL receptor folding and secretion, we transiently transfected U87 cells with cDNA for the soluble VLDL receptor together with cDNA for the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–110), the central domain (amino acids 91–210), or the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 191–323). When the amino-terminal or the central domain of RAP was co-expressed, 6.6 ± 0.1 and 16 ± 3% of the soluble VLDL receptor was secreted, respectively, compared with 63 ± 8% when the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP was co-expressed (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2, 4, and 6). The amount of labeled receptors retained intracellularly decreased accordingly when the carboxyl-terminal domain of RAP was co-expressed (Fig. 3 B, compare lane 5 with lanes 1 and 3). These results indicate that the carboxyl-terminal domain, but not the amino-terminal and the central domain, of RAP is sufficient to promote the proper folding and subsequent secretion of soluble VLDL receptor. To exclude the possibility that the carboxyl-terminal ER retention signal (15Bu G.J. Rennke S. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is present in the full-length and the carboxyl-terminal domain but not in the amino-terminal or central domain constructs of RAP, affected the chaperone function of RAP, we compared the secretion of soluble VLDL receptor with co-expression of RAP or RAPΔHNEL (12Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). No difference in the amount of secreted soluble VLDL receptor was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the presence or the absence of the ER retention signal does not affect the chaperone function of RAP during the folding and secretion of the soluble VLDL receptor. Thus, the function of RAP as a folding chaperone resides within its carboxyl-terminal domain. To determine which LBR of the VLDL receptor interacts with RAP and thereby facilitate its proper folding and intracellular processing, we generated VLDL receptor constructs containing the first three, the first five, or the last three of its eight LBR (see Fig.4). Cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs for each one of these constructs with co-transfection of cDNA for the empty vector or RAP. Transfected cells were then metabolically labeled for 4 h. Cell lysates were then divided into two equal parts. One half was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody, and the other half was subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP antibody under mild conditions (no SDS). The immunoprecipitated material was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. With MEF-4 cells, which express neither the LDLR nor LRP, 2J. Herz, unpublished observations. immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody resulted in the same amount of each VLDL receptor construct independent of the presence of RAP co-expression (Fig.5 A). However, co-immunoprecipitation under mild conditions with anti-RAP antibody resulted in detection of abundant VLDL receptor LBR 1–8, 1–3, and 1–5 but not VLDL receptor LBR 6–8 (Fig. 5 B). The weaker bands in the absence of RAP co-transfection are probably due to expression of endogenous RAP that co-immunoprecipitated VLDL receptor constructs. To overcome this potential effect of this endogenous RAP, we repeated the same experiment with MEF-7 (RAP−/−) cells (16Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody also indicated that all the constructs were expressed to the same extent (data not shown). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation with anti-RAP antibody resulted in abundant VLDL receptor constructs LBR 1–8, 1–3, and 1–5, but not LBR 6–8, when RAP was co-expressed (data not shown). Furthermore, similar results were found in parallel experiments in CHO LRP−/− cells stably transfected with VLDL receptor constructs (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that the RAP binding site resides within the first three LBR of the VLDL receptor.Figure 5RAP interacts with three amino-terminal ligand binding repeats of the VLDL receptor. MEF-4 cells (LDL receptor−/−; LRP−/−) were transiently transfected with cDNA for the respective VLDL receptor construct containing different groups of LBR (as shown in Fig. 4) with co-transfection of either pcDNA3 or cDNA for RAP. Transfected cells were continuously labeled with [35S]cysteine for 4 h. After cell lysis, half of the lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody and analyzed via 7.5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (A). The other half of the lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-RAP antibody under mild conditions (i.e. no SDS) (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous observations that demonstrated that RAP associates with newly synthesized LRP and assists in the proper folding and trafficking of the receptor established that RAP is an intracellular chaperone for LRP within the early secretory pathway (reviewed by Bu and Schwartz (34Bu G.J. Schwartz A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 272-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)). Since RAP also functions as an antagonist of ligand binding to other members of the LDL receptor gene family, it was hypothesized that RAP also serves as a molecular chaperone for these other receptors. The focus of the current investigation was to examine the potential role of RAP as a molecular chaperone for the VLDL receptor. Our results demonstrate that RAP indeed is a molecular chaperone for the VLDL receptor via interaction of its carboxyl-terminal domain with the first three LBR of the VLDL receptor. One common feature of RAP as a chaperone for LRP and the VLDL receptor is that RAP prevents the formation of mislinked disulfide bonds, which result in misfolding and retention of the receptors. In the absence of RAP co-expression, LRP appears to form high molecular weight aggregates as a result of intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, our results indicate that the major misfolding event for the VLDL receptor is primarily intramolecular. The importance of RAP as an intracellular trafficking chaperone for the VLDL receptor is further supported by the markedly increased intracellular accumulation of soluble VLDL receptor in the absence of RAP co-expression. Studies of RAP knockout mice by Willnow et al. (16Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) showed that functional LRP was reduced by 75%. In addition, only the ER form of the VLDL receptor was detected by Western blotting, supporting the notion that in these animals RAP is required for intracellular trafficking. Since our immunoprecipitation and cell surface iodination studies demonstrate that only the Golgi form, and not the ER form, traffics to the cell surface, it is likely that a significant portion of the VLDL receptor was misfolded and retained in the early secretory pathway in the RAP knockout mice. Previous studies have shown that RAP interacts with the LDL receptor with lower affinity when compared with LRP and the VLDL receptor (3Battey F.D. Gafvels M.E. FitzGerald D.J. Argraves W.S.

Consistent with this, the expression of the LDL receptor in RAP−/− mice is normal (16Willnow T.E. Rohlmann A. Horton J. Otani H. Braun J.R. Hammer R.E. Herz J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In transfection studies not shown here, we found that proper folding of a soluble form of the LDL receptor is not dependent on RAP;i.e. similar amounts of soluble LDL receptor are detected in transiently transfected cells independent of RAP co-expression. 3R. Savonen, L. M. Obermoeller, A. L. Schwartz, and G. Bu, unpublished data. Since the VLDL receptor and the LDL receptor share a high degree of structure homology, this is an interesting observation and suggests that it is the first LBR of the VLDL receptor that may account for the difference in RAP-dependent folding and trafficking between the VLDL and the LDL receptor. However, recent results from Rettenberger et al. (39Rettenberger P.M. Oka K. Ellgaard L. Petersen H.H. Christensen A. Martensen P.M. Monard D. Etzerodt M. Chan L. Andreasen P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8973-8980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) suggest that the absence of the third LBR of the VLDL receptor significantly reduces RAP binding. In addition, our data (Fig. 5) indicate that RAP interacts with one or more of the three amino-terminal LBR of the VLDL receptor, while the last three LBR do not bind RAP. Additional studies will be necessary to further identify which of the three LBR are most important for RAP and/or ligand binding and to explain the differences in ligand binding specificity between the LDL receptor and the VLDL receptor. The VLDL receptor is a multiligand receptor. The receptor probably plays a role in lipoprotein metabolism, since it binds apoE-enriched lipoproteins, such as β-VLDL (6Takahashi S. Kawarabayasi Y.

Furthermore, hypercholesterolemia can be reversed by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of the VLDL receptor (43Kozarsky K.F. Jooss K. Donahee M. Strauss III, J.F. Wilson J.M. Nat.

However, the importance of the receptor in lipoprotein metabolism under normal physiological conditions might be limited, since VLDL receptor knockout mice appear to be essentially normal, except for a slight decrease in body weight, body mass index, and adipose tissue (45Frykman P.K.

Along these lines, it is not currently known whether the sites of interaction of these ligands coincide with RAP binding sites of the VLDL receptor. A recent report by Webb et al. (47Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) suggests that the VLDL receptor regulates cell surface expression of the urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor and thereby modulates cellular motility. Hence, the VLDL receptor may play a role in tumor invasion and metastasis. In addition, a recent study has shown that the VLDL receptor and apoE receptor 2 are required for neuronal migration (48Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In that process, the VLDL receptor and apoE receptor 2 may bridge an extracellular matrix protein Reelin with a cytosolic adaptor protein mammalian Disabled (mDab 1), which activates intracellular kinase pathways. Thus, it will be of interest to examine whether differential RAP expression affects the biogenesis of the VLDL receptor under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In summary, the current study demonstrates that RAP functions as a molecular chaperone to facilitate the proper folding and trafficking of the VLDL receptor within the early secretory pathway. Although likely, further studies are required to determine whether RAP is a general chaperone for other members of the LDL receptor gene family.

https://openalex.org/W2083771851,"ArsA, an anion-stimulated ATPase, consists of two nucleotide binding domains, A1 in the N terminus and A2 in the C terminus of the protein, connected by a linker. The A1 domain contains a high affinity ATP binding site, whereas the A2 domain has low affinity and it requires the allosteric ligand antimonite for binding ATP. ArsA is known to form a UV-activated adduct with [α-32P]ATP in the linker region. This study shows that on addition of antimonite, much more adduct is formed. Characterization of the nature of the adduct suggests that it is between ArsA and ADP, instead of ATP, indicating that the adduct formation reflects hydrolysis of ATP. The present study also demonstrates that the A1 domain is capable of carrying out unisite catalysis in the absence of antimonite. On addition of antimonite, multisite catalysis involving both A1 and A2 sites occurs, resulting in a 40-fold increase in ATPase activity. Studies with mutant proteins suggest that the A2 site may be second in the sequence of events, so that its role in catalysis is dependent on a functional A1 site. It is also proposed that ArsA goes through an ATP-bound and an ADP-bound conformation, and the linker region, where ADP binds under both unisite and multisite catalytic conditions, may play an important role in the energy transduction process.

Full-Text PDF Open Access N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid ArsA and ArsB proteins together form a transport complex for efflux of arsenite or antimonite in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. ArsA is a peripheral membrane protein that forms the catalytic component of this transport complex (1Kaur P. Andersen J.P. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 23B. Jai Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 453-488Google Scholar, 2Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is of interest to determine how the energy of ATP hydrolysis by ArsA is transduced to the integral membrane protein ArsB that forms the carrier for the anions through the membrane. To obtain insights into how ArsA and ArsB proteins interact to form this primary pump, it is important to understand the mechanism of function of ArsA. ArsA is an anion-stimulated ATPase that consists of two consensus nucleotide binding sites, one in the N-terminal (A1) and other in the C-terminal (A2) half of the protein (1Kaur P. Andersen J.P. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 23B. Jai Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 453-488Google Scholar). The A1 and A2 domains of ArsA show significant internal sequence homology. An alignment of their primary amino acid sequence suggests that these two domains are connected by a linker region of about 40 amino acid residues (residues 283–323), the significance of which is not clear (1Kaur P. Andersen J.P. Advances in Molecular and Cell Biology. 23B. Jai Press, Inc., Greenwich, CT1998: 453-488Google Scholar). Mutations in either nucleotide binding fold have been shown to result in a loss of the anion-stimulated ATPase activity (3Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implying that both sites are required for function of the protein. It is not understood how the A1 and the A2 sites participate in catalysis or whether both sites are catalytic in nature. ATP binding studies carried out between ArsA and [α-32P]ATP by UV cross-linking showed that only the A1 domain is involved in forming a UV-activated adduct in the presence of ATP (4Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 351-357Crossref Google Scholar). The site of the adduct was identified to lie in the linker region connecting the A1 and the A2 domains (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Mutations in the A1 nucleotide binding fold resulted in an inability of the protein to form the adduct, whereas mutations in the A2 domain had no effect (3Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the A1 domain is crucial for formation of the ATP adduct with ArsA. The reason for lack of a similar adduct with ATP in the A2 domain has not been clear. That the A2 half of the protein actually binds nucleotide was recently shown by use of an ATP analogue, 5′-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine, which was shown to bind preferentially to the A2 site (7Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In that study, it was suggested that the A1 and A2 sites of ArsA have different conformations and different affinities for ATP. It was proposed that the A1 site is a high affinity ATP site that binds ATP in the absence of the ligand, whereas the A2 site has a very low affinity, and the binding of the ligand, arsenite or antimonite, acts as a switch that allows ATP binding to the A2 site. However, it is not clear whether two sites in ArsA have independent catalytic activity or what is the mechanism for catalytic co-operativity in this protein. The present study shows that the A1 domain of ArsA is capable of carrying out unisite catalysis in the absence of antimonite at a low rate. When the A2 site is also occupied with ATP, in the presence of antimonite, the catalytic activity increases. The data shown here also suggest that the A2 site is not an independent site and that it comes into action only after the A1 site is occupied, indicating antimonite-induced interaction between the A1 and A2 sites and thus providing first biochemical evidence of co-operativity between the the two sites in ArsA. Wild type or mutant His-tagged ArsA proteins were purified from E. coli cells containing the plasmid pET16b arsA as described earlier (7Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purified wild type and mutant ArsA proteins were photolabeled in the presence of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) or [3H]ADP (25 Ci/mmol) by a modification of the procedure described earlier (5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 351-357Crossref Google Scholar, 8Yue V.T. Schimmel P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 16: 4678-4684Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 10 μCi of labeled ATP or ADP. The samples were preincubated in the presence or absence of antimonite or magnesium for 10 min at 37 °C as indicated in the figure legends. Photolabeling reactions were carried out on ice for 30 min with a short wavelength (254 nm) hand-held torch. The photolabeled samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. Where indicated, the reactions were quenched by the addition of excess ADP or ATP to the sample before exposure to UV light. The labeled proteins from above were precipitated with 4 volumes of 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. The precipitated protein was washed three times with ether, air dried, and dissolved in 0.1 ml of 4m urea, pH 8.0. V-8 protease was added at a 10:1 ratio of protein to protease, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The samples were analyzed by a 12% polyacrylamide gel using the Tricine1-SDS electrophoresis system (9Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Analytical Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). ATPase activity of ArsA was determined by measurement of inorganic phosphate released from [γ-32P]ATP. Activity was measured in a 40-μl reaction volume containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol and the indicated amounts of the ArsA protein and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). Where indicated, the samples were preincubated with 0.5 mm antimonite at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of 5 mm magnesium chloride and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, 5-μl samples were withdrawn, and the reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of 10% SDS solution. The reactants and the products were separated by spotting 2 or 3 μl of the reaction on a polyethyleneimine TLC plate. Chromatography was carried out with a mobile phase consisting of 1 m formic acid and 0.7m LiCl (10Hiromura M. Yano M. Mori H. Inoue M. Kido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5435-5438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the resolved spots was quantitated with a Fuji phosphoimager, and the amount of32Pi released was calculated in nmol/mg of the ArsA protein. To determine kinetic parameters of hydrolysis for unisite or multisite catalysis, ATPase activity at different concentrations of ATP was determined in the absence or presence of antimonite. The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was kept constant at all the concentrations of ATP tested. The data were analyzed by the enzyme analysis software Enzfitter using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics equation. ArsA has previously been shown to form an adduct with [α-32P]ATP on activation with UV light (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Rosen B.P. Weigel U. Karkaria C. Gangola P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3067-3070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, effect of antimonite on the cross-linking reaction was investigated. These experiments led to a reevaluation of the nature of the adduct and have provided significant new insights into the mechanism of function of the enzyme. To determine the effect of antimonite on UV cross-linking of ArsA with [ α-32P]ATP, one set of samples was preinucbated in the presence of antimonite at 37 °C before exposure to UV light. Data shown in Fig.1 A indicate that the sample that had been preincubated with antimonite contained much higher levels of the adduct (lane 3) compared with the sample that either contained no antimonite (lane 2) or the sample that contained antimonite but was not preincubated at 37 °C (lane 1). Because antimonite is known to bring about stimulation of hydrolysis of ATP by ArsA (2Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), increased labeling in the presence of antimonite may be resulting from increased hydrolysis of ATP by ArsA rather than due to enhanced binding of ATP. Addition of excess cold ADP or ATP to the reaction just before exposure to UV light was found to quench the adduct. At 0.5 and 1.0 mm concentrations of the cold nucleotide, ADP was found to be more effective at quenching the reaction compared with ATP as seen in Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4, but at 5.0 mm, both quenched the reaction completely (lanes 5 and 6). To determine the nature of the adduct in the UV cross-linking reaction, labeling of ArsA in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP was compared. Data in Fig. 1 C indicate that much less adduct is formed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (lanes 5–8) compared with when [α-32P]ATP is used (lanes 1–4), indicating that the adduct might be formed between ArsA and [32P]ADP resulting from hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP. [32P]ADP would not result from hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP, thus explaining the absence of a detectable adduct. To verify that it is indeed ADP that forms the adduct with ArsA, [3H]ADP was used directly in the cross-linking reaction. Data in Fig.2 show that ArsA can be cross-linked to ADP on exposure to UV light (lane 1). The presence or absence of antimonite or magnesium did not affect the adduct formation significantly (lanes 1–4). Presence of excess cold ADP in the reaction quenched the reaction completely (lane 5). From the data shown in Figs. 1 and 2, it can be concluded that the adduct on exposure to UV light is between ArsA and ADP and that increased hydrolysis of ATP by ArsA in the presence of antimonite results in increased adduct with ADP. Mutants in the A2 domain of ArsA, which contain a normal A1 domain, have previously been shown to form an adduct in the presence of ATP on UV cross-linking (4Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mutants in the A1 domain do not form the adduct (3Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data in Fig.3 A indicate that, unlike the case with the wild type protein (lanes 1 and 2), preincubation with antimonite has no significant effect on the adduct formed with the A2 mutants GA337 or GR337 (lanes 3–6). A1 mutant GS20 showed no adduct in the presence or absence of antimonite (lanes 7 and 8). Previous studies have indicated that the N-terminal peptide N35 (residues 1–323), consisting of the A1 domain plus the linker, forms an independent domain capable of forming an adduct in the presence of ATP on exposure to UV light (5Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 175: 351-357Crossref Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 3 B indicate that, as in the case of A2 mutants, antimonite has no effect on the amount of the adduct formed with N35 (lanes 1 and 2), indicating that the A2 domain is required for the stimulatory effect of antimonite. The UV cross-linking experiments described above suggest that adduct in the absence of antimonite results primarily from the function of A1 site, whereas increased adduct on addition of antimonite is the result of involvement of both A1 and A2. Because the adduct is between ArsA and ADP, these data suggest that ArsA carries out unisite catalysis from the A1 site in the absence of antimonite and multisite catalysis from both A1 and A2 in the presence of antimonite. This is further supported by the observation that mutants in the A2 site are still able to form the adduct due to catalysis by A1 and the adduct in these mutants is not affected by antimonite, whereas mutants in the A1 site do not form the adduct due to absence of both unisite and multisite catalysis. The site where the adduct forms in the absence of antimonite has previously been identified to lie in a 40-amino acid stretch in the linker region (residues 283–320) connecting the A1 and the A2 domains (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 4, lane 4). Because enhanced adduct formation was seen under conditions where antimonite was present, it was of interest to determine whether this was due to the formation of the adduct at an additional site, perhaps resulting from catalysis in the A2 domain. In the present study, the same amounts of the the ArsA protein labeled with [α-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of antimonite were subjected to complete digestion with the V-8 protease, as carried out earlier (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Data in Fig. 4 suggest that in both samples (labeled in either the presence (lane 3) or the absence (lane 4) of antimonite), the same 5-kDa fragment is labeled. The 5-kDa fragment originating from the protein labeled in the presence of antimonite contained much more adduct (lane 3) compared with the fragment originating from the protein labeled in the absence of antimonite (lane 4). These results suggest that the site of adduct under both conditions is same, and only the amount of the adduct is different; in either case, the adduct lies in the linker region. To further analyze unisite and multisite catalysis by ArsA, the amounts of phosphate released upon hydrolysis of ATP from A1 or from A1 and A2 together were determined. [γ-32P]ATP was employed in these experiments, and the amount of32Pi released was determined by TLC as described under “Materials and Methods.” The autoradiogram of a TLC obtained from a typical experiment is shown in Fig.5. In this experiment, the wild type ArsA protein was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of magnesium and antimonite. The upper spot in the autoradiogram is the released 32Pi, whereas the lower spot represents the unhydrolyzed [γ-32P]ATP. The results in Fig. 5 show hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of magnesium without the addition of antimonite (lane 1) as predicted from UV cross-linking experiments mentioned earlier (Figs. 1 and 2). On addition of antimonite, the amount of 32Pi released is significantly higher (Fig. 5, lane 3). In the absence of magnesium, no ATP hydrolysis was observed either in the presence (lane 4) or in the absence (lane 2) of antimonite, which indicates that the catalysis observed in lane 1 (in the presence of magnesium and absence of antimonite) is significant and that a two-step catalysis mechanism exists; the first step involves the function of A1 in the presence of magnesium but absence of antimonite, and second step involves function of both A1 and A2 in the presence of magnesium and antimonite. Hydrolysis by ArsA in the absence of antimonite has been observed before (2Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the fact that it is the result of unisite catalysis from A1 could not be deduced from earlier observations. In this study, it was also found that the A2 mutants are able to carry out unisite catalysis at almost the same rate as the wild type protein; however, on addition of antimonite, no further increase in the Pi released was seen, as would be expected due to a mutation in the A2 site. A1 mutants showed a much lower rate of32Pi release, implying absence of both unisite and multisite catalysis (data not shown). Because ATP is hydrolyzed by ArsA at different rates under conditions utilizing the A1 domain alone (in the absence of antimonite) or A1 and A2 domains together (in the presence of antimonite), it was of interest to determine the Km and Vmax of the protein under these conditions. Hence, the initial rate of hydrolysis by ArsA at several different concentrations of ATP was determined. Fig.6 shows the rate of32Pi released at different concentrations of ATP in the absence and presence of antimonite. The kinetic constants obtained upon analysis of the data by the Lineweaver-Burk plot suggest that the Vmax of the A1 site alone is about140th the Vmax obtained for the A1 + A2 sites together. However, Km of the A1 site alone or A1 + A2 sites together lies within the same range, which is around 150–200 μm, implying that the A1 site by itself has a high affinity for ATP that is equal to the overall affinity obtained in the presence of antimonite. Km and Vmax data in the presence of antimonite have been reported earlier (2Hsu C.-M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17349-17354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the values obtained in this study are in the same range as before. In most positively regulated allosteric proteins, the binding of an effector serves to increase the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Hence, the effect of the ligand can be bypassed by increasing the substrate concentration. However, allosteric regulation of the ATPase activity of ArsA by antimonite appears to occur by a novel mechanism, in which binding of antimonite acts as an “on/off” switch that allows ATP binding to the A2 site (7Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The A1 site of ArsA is a high affinity site, and it does not require antimonite for ATP binding; however, the A2 site appears to be inaccessible to ATP in the absence of the ligand (7Ramaswamy S. Kaur P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9243-9248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This novel mechanism of allosteric regulation in ArsA results from the fact that the two ATP binding sites in ArsA have different conformations, and the A2 site is in an “open” conformation only when the ligand is present. In the present study, it is shown that the A1 site of ArsA is capable of carrying out unisite catalysis in the presence of magnesium alone; however, the addition of antimonite brings about an involvement of the A2 site, thus switching the protein from unisite to multisite catalysis. For full catalytic activity of ArsA, an interaction between A1 and A2 is required which is brought about by antimonite. Whether the A2 site also carries out unisite catalysis is not clear at the moment. Unisite catalytic activity of the A1 site is strongly supported by UV cross-linking experiments carried out with [α-32P]ATP. Previous experiments with ArsA resulted in the identification of a 40-amino acid stretch of protein that forms a linker connecting the A1 and the A2 domains as the site where the UV-activated adduct lies (6Kaur P. Rosen B.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6456-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The adduct formation was abolished in mutations in the A1 Walker A sequence but was unaffected by mutations in the A2 domain (3Karkaria C.E. Chen C.M. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7832-7836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kaur P. Rosen B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19272-19277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that only the A1 domain of ArsA is involved in binding ATP in the UV-catalyzed reaction. The reason for the lack of a similar adduct in the A2 domain has been elusive. Experiments described in this paper provide an interesting explanation for the absence of the adduct in A2: it might lie in the fact that the site identified earlier is shared between A1 and A2 and that the adduct is the result of stepwise catalytic reactions, involving first A1 and then A2, as described below. The data shown here suggest that UV cross-linking actually reflects binding of ADP and not binding of ATP as assumed earlier. Hence, the site of adduct formation, identified earlier, is the site where the product of the reaction ADP binds. Second, it is shown that addition of antimonite enhances the adduct formation significantly. If the adduct is between ArsA and ADP, thus reflecting hydrolysis of ATP, then adduct formation in the absence of antimonite reflects unisite catalysis by A1, and adduct formation in the presence of antimonite would reflect multisite catalysis involving A1 and A2. This is supported by the fact that point mutants in the A1 site do not form the adduct, whereas point mutants in the A2 site form the adduct. Interestingly, the addition of antimonite has no significant effect on the adduct formation in A2 mutants, implying the absence of multisite catalysis in these mutants. Hence, A2 mutants seem to carry the first half of the reaction, i.e. unisite catalysis in A1 leading to formation of the ADP adduct, correctly. These results imply that the A1 site is first in the sequence of events, and A2 comes into play later. Absence of an adduct in GS20 in either the absence or presence of antimonite suggests that the A2 site, by itself, is not catalytic/functional, and even though antimonite brings about the participation of A2 in catalysis, it requires a functional A1 to do that. Hence, it seems reasonable to suggest that antimonite brings about an interaction between an intact A1 and A2 site that may precede ATP binding to A2 resulting in catalytic co-operativity. It is possible that the A2 site may only play a regulatory role so that ATP binding to A2 allows much faster product release from A1 without itself being catalytic in the process. A model showing unisite and multisite catalysis in ArsA is shown in Fig.7. Unisite and multisite catalytic activity is well documented for the FoF1 ATPase (12Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). F1ATPase contains three catalytic sites on three separate β subunits. The three sites in F1 are equivalent; however, they are asymmetric in their affinity for ATP, resulting in three Km values (13Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Which site is the high affinity site at any particular time is determined by the rotational position of the γ subunit with respect to the α3β3 head. Hence, each site in turn becomes a high affinity site (14Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). At substoichiometric concentrations of ATP, the high affinity site in F1 is filled with ATP and is able to carry out unisite catalysis. At higher concentrations, ATP binds to the second and the third sites, and it causes a 106-fold higher rate of product release from the first high affinity site (13Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ArsA is different in that the asymmetry between the two nucleotide binding sites in ArsA is present in the structure of the protein. The A1 site is a high affinity site and is able to carry out unisite catalysis just like each of the three sites in F1, whereas binding of ATP to A2 seems to be controlled by a switch, which is the binding of the ligand antimonite. Filling of the A2 site with ATP results in catalytic co-operativity between A1 and A2; however, it is not clear whether, like each of the three catalytic sites in F1, the A2 site is able to carry out catalysis. Even though, under multisite catalytic conditions, the amount of the UV-activated adduct formed with ADP is significantly increased, it was found that the adduct under both unisite and multisite conditions lies in the same location, i.e. in the linker region. As discussed above, UV cross-linking between ArsA and [α-32P]ATP identifies a site where the product of the reaction, ADP, binds. The experiments described here suggest that there is only one such site in ArsA, thus explaining why it has not been possible to identify an adduct site specific for the A2 domain. Binding of ADP to the linker under either condition (unisite using A1 or multisite using A1 and A2) suggests that the linker region might lie at the interface of the A1 and the A2 domains, and the ADP binding site in the linker region is a site common to both A1 and A2. In addition, such a location for binding of ADP might have significant implications in the energy transduction process. The fact that there is an ADP-bound conformation resulting from hydrolysis suggests that the ArsA protein switches between the ATP-bound and the ADP-bound states. It seems likely that one of these two conformations may be active in terms of the ability of the protein to interact with the ArsB protein. Hence, the linker region might be actively involved in the energy transduction process. Switching between the ADP- and ATP-bound forms of a protein has been shown for other ATPases, and it has been suggested that this switching is involved in the transduction of energy (15Milburn M. Tong L. DeVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 16Story R. Steitz A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In the RecA protein, it has been suggested that, in addition to the Walker A and Walker B motifs that form the nucleotide binding site, the protein contains a motif C that undergoes conformational changes upon hydrolysis of ATP causing it to interact with its substrate DNA (16Story R. Steitz A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 374-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In ArsA, the linker region might be equivalent to the region C of RecA, and it might be directly involved in interacting with ArsB. This is an interesting extension of the studies described herein, which needs to be investigated further. Hence, understanding the biochemical basis of catalysis in proteins such as ArsA and the conformational changes that result from catalysis would eventually lead to an understanding of the mechanism of energy transduction between the catalytic component and the membrane component of the pump.

However, it cannot be excluded that an ERK-2-independent pathway might be used in primary T cells. Indeed a result obtained with splenocytes from transgenic mice expressing an inactive form of MEK-1 (12Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility of the existence of a TCR/CD3-induced MEK-1/ERK-2-independent pathway even though one can question whether these cells, which developed in the absence of positive selection, are representative of a normal T lymphocyte population. Therefore, a clear physiological involvement of the MEK/ERK cascade in T cell activation is still a matter of debate, in part due to the fact that molecular genetic approaches are limited to cell lines or transgenic animals. Our aim was to study whether the stimulatory signals from the TCR/CD3 complex that promote IL-2 gene transcription obligatorily involve the p21ras/Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 pathway in primary T cells. We used highly purified CD4+ human lymphocytes that we stimulated with UCHT1 or X-35, two mitogenic anti-CD3 mAb (13Bourel D. Genetet N. Merdrignac G. Genetet B. Pathol. Biol. 1987; 35: 1285-1291PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lobach D.F. Singer K.H. Haynes B.F. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 174-175Google Scholar) recognizing the ε chain of the CD3 complex (15Tunnacliffe A. Olsson C. De la Hera A. Int.

Haynes B.F. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 174-175Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of these antibodies on the Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation cascade. We found that, in contrast to what happens with UCHT1, activation of IL-2 gene transcription triggered upon X-35 ligation occurred without activation of the Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 pathway; moreover, we showed that this ERK-2-independent pathway does not involve activation of p21ras. Altogether, the results we present herein demonstrate that activation of p21ras/Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation cascade is not an obligatory event triggered upon TCR/CD3 ligation; moreover, they bring evidence that activation of this cascade is not essential for IL-2 gene transcription in human T lymphocytes. UCHT1 (IgG1) and X-35 (IgG2a) anti-CD3 mAb were from Immunotech (Marseille, France), mouse anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, New York); rabbit anti-ERK-2 Ab, rabbit anti-Raf-1 Ab, and rabbit anti-ZAP-70 Ab were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit anti-phosphoserine 473 PKB and PD098059 were from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA), and PMA and myelin basic protein (MBP) were from Sigma. GST-Elk-1 was obtained from Dr. A. Nordheim (Tubingen University, Germany). Peripheral blood monocyte cells were isolated from peripheral blood from healthy donors. Monocytes were removed by plastic adherence, and CD4+ T cells were purified (>99% pure) by positive immunoselection using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD4 mAb (Dynal International, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before being used, CD4+-purified T cells were left 15 to 18 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. CD4+ cells were stimulated (72 h) either with soluble anti-CD3 mAb or with anti-CD3 coated on anti-IgG-conjugated beads. Proliferation was estimated by a 4-h [3H]thymidine incorporation. CD4+ T cells were stimulated for 6 h in the presence of 1 μm ionomycin and anti-CD3 mAb (1 μg/ml). The cells were treated with PD098059 (30 μm) as described. Total RNA isolation, reverse transcription reaction, and polymerase chain reaction were performed as already described (16Lafont V. Rouot B. Favero J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This analysis was performed as described (16Lafont V. Rouot B. Favero J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, CD4+ cells (5 × 106/ml) were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) or phorbol esters (PMA or phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu)). The supernatants were resolved in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred onto a PVDF membrane (polyscreen, NEN Life Science Products). After blocking of nonspecific binding, the membrane was probed with anti-ERK-2 Ab (0.2 μg/ml) and revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:20,000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products). Reprobing of the same blots with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (1 μg/ml) was performed after stripping of bound Ab. The membrane was revealed with 1:10,000 solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated-anti-mouse Ab and the chemiluminescence detection system. Raf-1 was similarly revealed on PVDF membranes electroblotted from 8% SDS-PAGE (anti-Raf-1 antibody was used as 0.5 μg/ml). This experiment was done as described (16Lafont V. Rouot B. Favero J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Stimulated cells were lysed, and ERK-2 was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-ERK antibody and protein A-Sepharose. After washing, in vitro phosphorylation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase buffer with 10 μg of MBP, 50 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted and visualized by autoradiography, and quantitatively analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). GST-Elk-1 phosphorylation was performed as already reported (17Ruckdeschel K. Machold J. Roggenkamp A. Schubert S. Pierre J. Zumbihl R. Liautard J-P. Heesemann J. Rouot B. J. Biol.

Briefly, activated cells were lysed, and the supernatants were mixed with GST fusion protein kinase substrate and glutathione-agarose (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The substrate-agarose complexes were washed, and in vitro phosphorylation was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C in kinase assay buffer. Proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred, and revealed by autoradiography. Purified CD4+ cells (20.106/ml) were incubated with anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) or phorbol esters (PDBu, 50 ng/ml) and then lysed for 30 min in cold lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaF, 10 mmiodoacetamide, 75 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na2VO3, and pepstatin A, chymostatin, and leupeptin (each at 1 mg/ml). The supernatant were mixed with GST-Ras binding domain of Raf (RDB) fusion protein (10 μg/ml) (a generous gift from Dr. Julian Downward, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) and glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 C. GST-RBD contains the Ras binding domain of Raf and binds only the active form of Ras (19Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Protein-agarose complexes were washed and solubilized in electrophoresis buffer. Proteins were resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted. The membrane was revealed with an anti-Ras mAb (Calbiochem). These experiments were done as in Lafont et al. (18Lafont V. Fischer T. Zumbihl R. Faure S. Hivroz C. Rouot B. Favero J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2261-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, 107 CD4+ T cells stimulated with PDBu or with anti-CD3 mAb were lysed, and p56lck was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-p56lck polyclonal Ab (a generous gift from Dr. S. Fisher, Hôpital Cochin, Paris, France) and protein A-Sepharose. Complexes were resuspended in kinase buffer, and autophosphorylation of p56lck was determined in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products). Radiolabeled protein were then resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto PVDF membrane. and detected by autoradiography. 5 ×107 unstimulated CD4+ T cells as well as X-35-or UCHT1-stimulated cells (5 min at 37 °C) were lysed in lysis buffer, and ZAP-70 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ZAP-70 polyclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitate complexes were recovered and solubilized in electrophoresis buffer. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting, the membrane was revealed with antiphosphotyrosine 4G10. The blot was then reprobed after stripping of bound Ab with anti-ZAP-70 antibody. Purified CD4+ cells (5.106/ml) were incubated with anti-CD3 mAb (10 μg/ml) for the indicated times and lysed in a lysis buffer comprised of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml chymostatin. The supernatants were resolved in a 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking of nonspecific binding, the membrane was probed with a rabbit antiphosphoserine 473 PKB Ab (1:1000) and revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Reprobing of the same blots with the anti-PKB Ab (1:1000) was performed after stripping of bound Ab. The membrane was revealed with 1:2000 solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated-anti-rabbit Ab and the chemiluminescence detection system. Raf-1 was similarly revealed on PVDF membranes electroblotted from 8% SDS-PAGE (anti-Raf-1 antibody was used as 0.5 μg/ml). Cells were stimulated and lysed as described for MAP kinase phosphorylation studies. The proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was transferred onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking of nonspecific binding, the membrane was probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 antibody (1 μg/ml) and revealed with a 1:10,000 solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse Ab followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. We first showed that highly purified CD4+ T cells that do not respond to soluble anti-CD3 mAb are activated by and proliferate in response to both X-35 and UCHT1 when coated on beads (Table I).Table IProliferative response of T cells to X-35 and UCHT1 stimulationStimulationNSPHASoluble X-35Soluble UCHT1Conjugated X-35Conjugated UCHT1[3H]Thymidine incorporation160 ± 2559891 ± 3344161 ± 19157 ± 3821810 ± 208013261 ± 2029CD4+-purified T lymphocytes from healthy donors were stimulated (for 72 h) with optimal doses of soluble X-35 or UCHT1 or with the anti-CD3 mAb previously coated on anti-mouse IgG-conjugated magnetic beads.

Proliferation was estimated by [3H]thymidine incorporation (cpm ± S.D.). S.D. was calculated from quadruplicates. This experiment is representative of three. NS, nonstimulated. We then analyzed phosphorylation (appearance on electroblot of a slow migrating band) (20Whitehurst C.E. Boulton T.G. Cobb M.H. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3230-3237PubMed Google Scholar, 21Trotta R. Kanakaraj P. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1027-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and activation of ERK-2. Fig.1 A shows that a shifted band, not present after 1-min stimulation, is clearly detected by anti-ERK-2 Ab after a 5-min activation with UCHT1, then diminishes after 15 min and is no more detectable after 20 min. Conversely, no shifted band can be detected in X-35 stimulation at any time of the analysis. These experiments were performed using 10 μg/ml anti-CD3 mAb. We checked that the difference between the two mAb in term of ERK-2 activation is also observed in a large concentration range (1 to 20 μg/ml) (data not shown). A parallel study analyzing tyrosine phosphorylation after a 5-min stimulation similarly showed (Fig. 1 B) that ERK-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in UCHT1 but not in X-35-stimulated cells. We also established that only ERK-2 immunoprecipitated from UCHT1 (or PMA)-treated cells was able to phosphorylate (maximum after a 5-min stimulation) over basal level MBP when used as exogenous substrate (Fig. 1 C). Enzymatic activity was confirmed using GST-Elk-1, the GST fusion protein of ERK-2 physiological substrate (22Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), which was highly phosphorylated by lysates from cells pretreated with PMA or UCHT1 but not from cells treated with X-35 (Fig. 1 D). It is noteworthy that we did not detect phosphorylation of ERK1 in neither X-35- nor UCHT1-stimulated cells (not shown). Analysis of Raf-1, the upstream kinase in the MAP kinase cascade, shows that this MAP kinase kinase kinase is also phosphorylated upon UCHT1 and PMA stimulation but not upon X-35 activation (Fig.2). IL-2 gene transcription, a key event in T cell activation and proliferation, is regulated by the coordinate action of multiple nuclear factors including NF-AT. Previous results have brought evidence that NF-AT activation is directly dependent on stimulation of Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation cascade. Since our preceding results suggested that this pathway is not activated in X-35 stimulation, we questioned whether IL-2 gene transcription could occur when the ERK-2 pathway is blocked with PD098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK-1 (23Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A confirms that ERK-2 activation, which only occurs in UCHT1 and PMA stimulation (as assessed by the appearance of a slower migrating band and the phosphorylation of GST-Elk-1), is indeed prevented by PD098059. In parallel, Fig.3 B shows that, in the absence of inhibitor, IL-2 mRNA expression is induced by both mAbs, whereas in the presence of inhibitor, IL-2 mRNA expression is blocked in UCHT1-stimulated cells and is not in X-35-activated cells. This result demonstrates that IL-2 gene transcription triggered upon X-35 ligation does not involve activation of Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 pathway. Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 has been described as a p21ras effector pathway for NF-AT induction in Jurkat T cells. Rac-1, along with other possible pathways, has also been shown in Jurkat cells to participate in this stimulation as downstream effectors of p21ras (9Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), confirming that this small G protein played a pivotal role in lymphocyte stimulation. We therefore questioned whether the ERK-2-independent pathway, which is triggered in human primary T lymphocytes upon X-35 stimulation, involves activation of p21ras. Fig. 4 shows that p21ras activation can be detected in UCHT1 (the most intense band appearing at 5 min) as well as in phorbol ester-treated cells (used as a control) but not in X-35-stimulated lymphocytes. This results strongly suggest that X-35 binding to CD3 on purified T cells triggers IL-2 gene transcription through a stimulation pathway independent of p21ras activation. Upstream of the p21ras/MAP kinase phosphorylation cascade, the events that are directly induced upon engagement of the TCR are tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) of ζ and CD3 chains by Src family tyrosine kinases Fyn and Lck (2Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). These phosphorylated motifs provide docking sites for the protein-tyrosine kinases ZAP-70 and Syk, that are phosphorylated and activated (2Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 24Defranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 75: 163-175Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Activation of these protein-tyrosine kinases has been shown to be necessary for propagating downstream signaling. We therefore studied phosphorylation of p56lck, p59fyn, and of ZAP-70 in primary T cells stimulated either with UCHT1 or X-35; as shown in Fig.5 A, a shifted band can be observed in p56lck only after a 15-min stimulation with UCHT1 and not with X-35. No activation of p59fyn could be detected either with UCHT1 or X-35 stimulation (not shown). Concerning ZAP-70, the presence of which is detected by anti-ZAP-70 Ab, it appears to be phosphorylated in cells stimulated by both anti-CD3 mAb (Fig.5 B). Recently, it was shown that the two serine/threonine kinases PKB/Akt (29Genot E. Reif K. Beach S. Kramer I. Cantrell D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1731-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the Tec kinase ITK (30Gibson S. August A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Dupont B. Mills G.B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2716-2722PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yang W.C. Ghiotto M. Barbarat B. Olive D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) are phosphorylated and activated during T cell activation via TCR/CD3. PKB/Akt as well as ITK have a pleckstrin homology domain (32Frech M. Andjelkovic M. Ingley E. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Hemmings B.A. J Biol Chem. 1997; 272: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 33August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that interacts with membrane-phosphorylated inositol lipids generated by activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; after recruitment to the cell membrane, PKB/Akt and ITK are able to be phosphorylated and activated by PDK1/PDK2 kinases and Src kinases, respectively. PKB/Akt and ITK appear as downstream targets for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (33August A. Sadra A. Dupont B. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11227-11232Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34Boudewijn M. Burgering T.H. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), the activity of which has been detected in immunoprecipitates of the ζ and ε chains of the TCR following cell surface engagement of the TCR (35Exley M. Varticovski L. Peter M. Sancho J. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15140-15146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36de Aos I. Metzger M.H. Exley M. Dahl C.E. Misra S. Zheng D. Varticovski L. Terhorst C. Sancho J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25310-25318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We therefore studied activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and ITK. Most of the studies on ITK activation have been performed using the Jurkat T cell line. Using highly purified primary T cells we actually failed to bring evidence of any phosphorylation of ITK immunoprecipitated from cells activated with one or the other anti-CD3 mAb. In contrast, we showed (Fig. 5 C) that the serine/threonine PKB/Akt, which is immunoprecipitated in equal quantity from one or the other anti-CD3 mAb (visualized by a pan-PKB antibody), was phosphorylated only in cells stimulated with UCHT1 but not in cells activated by X-35 as revealed by an anti-phospho-PKB antibody. This result suggests that X-35 does not trigger activation of TCR-related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. It appears that, except for ZAP-70, which is phosphorylated in both cases, none of the signals we studied that are commonly described as activation signals in T cell stimulation via TcR/CD3, are triggered upon X-35 stimulation. This is in line with what can be observed on phosphorylation electrophoretic profiles obtained with lysates from UCHT1- or X-35-stimulated cells (Fig. 6). Indeed, in UCHT1, several bands appear phosphorylated, whereas in X-35, the profile is very similar to that from unstimulated cells except for one single band at 58 kDa, which is present in X-35- and not in UCHT1-activated cells. This 58-kDa band, which we have not yet characterized, could represent an important signaling intermediate in the Ras/MEK/ERK-independent pathway triggered by X-35 anti-CD3 mAb. The results we present herein provide evidence that activation of the p21ras/Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation cascade is not an event obligatorily triggered upon stimulation of purified T lymphocytes through the TCR/CD3 complex. Moreover they support the related conclusion that, in primary T cells, IL-2 gene transcription may occur independently of the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. Indeed we have shown that, in contrast to the commonly used UCHT1, which triggers MAP kinase activation, the anti-CD3 mAb X-35 triggers lymphocyte stimulation leading to IL-2 gene transcription and cell proliferation without activating ERK-2; moreover, using the MEK-1 inhibitor PD098059, we demonstrated that the blockade of ERK-2 phosphorylation has no effect on IL-2 mRNA expression induced by X-35. These results demonstrate that the Ras/Raf-1/MEK-1/ERK-2 phosphorylation cascade is not an exclusive and necessary pathway in TCR/CD3-induced T cell activation. The possibility of the existence of a MAP kinase-independent stimulation of T cells has been suggested using splenocytes from transgenic mice expressing an inactive form of MEK-1 (12Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); however, as pointed out by others (11Whitehurst C.E. Geppert T.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1020-1029PubMed Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the splenic T cells in these transgenic mice, which developed in the absence of positive selection, are representative of a normal T lymphocyte population. It has been demonstrated that Rac-1 participates in the stimulation process in parallel and in addition to ERK-2 pathway but still as an effector of p21ras (9Genot E. Cleverley S. Henning S. Cantrell D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3923-3933Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); however, a hypothesis of an involvement of Rac-1 as an effector of Ras seems unlikely since we showed that p21ras is not activated upon X-35 binding. However, the possibility remains that in X-35 stimulation, Rac-1 could act instead of p21ras. Recently Rac-1 and/or CDC-42 were shown to be involved in NF-AT activation through activation of the serine threonine kinase Pak-1 (26Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); however, evidence has been provided that Pak-1 acts upstream of Ras and participates in a signaling event required for TCR-mediated Ras activation (26Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We analyzed Jun N-terminal kinase (25Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) stimulation in both UCHT1 and X-35 activation (data not shown); this kinase appeared very faintly but similarly stimulated in both cases and, therefore, is probably not involved in this phenomenon. The difference between the two antibodies in their differential capacity to stimulate ERK-2 cannot be attributed to the fact that they are of different isotype; indeed we studied MAP kinase activation using purified CD4+ T cells totally depleted from Fc receptor-expressing cells. Moreover, we found that OKT3, an anti-CD3 mAb of the same isotype than X-35, behaves as UCHT1, i.e. it stimulates ERK-2. As already described, the two antibodies immunoprecipitate the same proteins, and their different abilities would therefore be more likely related to different epitopes recognized by each anti-CD3 mAbs, likely on the CD3 ε chain as demonstrated by Tunnacliffe et al. (15Tunnacliffe A. Olsson C. De la Hera A. Int. Immunol. 1989; 1: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recognition of different functional epitopes by the two antibodies was confirmed in several other studies (37Yang S.Y. Rhee S. Angelos G. Dupont B. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 116-119Google Scholar, 38Denning M.D. Tuck D.T. Singer K.H. Haynes B.F. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 144-147Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, on tissue section of human thymus, UCHT1 has been shown to present a reactivity to medullary and cortical thymocytes, whereas X-35 reacted only with medullary thymocytes (14Lobach D.F. Singer K.H. Haynes B.F. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 174-175Google Scholar). Our results on proliferative response of purified T cells using immobilized anti-CD3 or of peripheral blood monocyte cells using soluble mAb (not shown) bring evidence that the response to X-35 is higher than that obtained with UCHT1. Such a difference in the response level between the two antibodies was already observed by others (14Lobach D.F. Singer K.H. Haynes B.F. Leukocyte Typing III. Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 174-175Google Scholar). A higher proliferative response induced by X-35 can be explained by the fact that higher amounts of IL-2 are produced by X-35 than by UCHT1 (not shown). This higher production of the protein correlates with a higher expression of IL-2 mRNA in X-35 stimulation. Therefore it seems that stimulation of the p21ras/ERK-2-independent pathway triggered by X-35 could be more efficient for IL-2 gene transcription and IL-2 production. One could then question whether inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway could be a potentiating factor in activation of primary T cells. This appears unlikely since we showed that MEK/ERK inhibition by PD098059 results in the inhibition of IL-2 mRNA production in UCHT1-stimulated cells. A recent study (39Dumont F.J. Staruch M.J. Fisher P. DaSilva C. Camacho R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2579-2589PubMed Google Scholar) has also shown on primary T cells stimulated with a mouse mAb to CD3 (IgE isotype) that the blockade of the MEK/ERK pathway inhibited IL-2 production but differentially modulated the production of other cytokines. It appears, however, that the proximal activation induced by both mAbs after their ligation on CD3 involves phosphorylation of ZAP-70, suggesting that the respective pathways induced by UCHT1 or X-35 diverge downstream in this protein-tyrosine kinase. Concerning p56lck or p59fyn, their autophosphorylation is difficult to detect in primary T cells, and the phosphorylated p56lck band that appears only in UCHT1-activated cells after a relatively long time activation (15 min) is probably not due to its direct autophosphorylation but is likely due to phosphorylation induced by activated ERK-2 as described previously (27Watts J.D. Sangherat J.S. Pelech S.L. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23275-23282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gold M.R. Chiu R. Ingham R.J. Saxton T.M. Van Ooosten I. Watts J.D. Affolter M. Aebersold R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2369-2380PubMed Google Scholar). This result is in line with the fact that UCHT1 triggers ERK-2 activation, whereas X-35 does not. We also considered two other TCR-related signals, i.e. activation of the two protein kinases PKB/Akt and ITK; activation of these kinases is dependent on activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase normally triggered following engagement of the TcR/CD3 complex. We failed to detect phosphorylation of ITK in both cases, but our results show that PKB/Akt is phosphorylated upon UCHT1 treatment and not upon X-35 stimulation, suggesting that the latter anti-CD3 mAb does not induce activation of the TCR-related phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway. Studying the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of total lysates from UCHT1- or X-35-stimulated cells, it appears that a single band around 58 kDa is present in X-35 and not in UCHT1 activation. This band unlikely represents phosphorylated p56lck or p59fyn, since we showed that phosphorylation of these protein-tyrosine kinases are difficult to observe in primary T cells even using [γ-32P]ATP. However, this band, which is not yet characterized, could represent an important signaling molecule involved in the Ras/MEK/ERK-independent pathway triggered by X-35. Previous studies to explore the role of MAP kinases in TCR function have looked at regulation of the transcription factor NF-AT in the Jurkat cell line. In these cells, experiments with inhibitory mutants of the MAP kinase pathway have suggested that NF-AT activation is dependent on the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. These data now show that in peripheral blood T cells ERK-2 activation is not an obligatory signal for IL-2 gene transcription. This illustrates that Jurkat cells, although a good model for the initial receptor proximal biochemical processes associated with T cell activation, may not be an appropriate model for cytokine gene regulation as it relates to primary human T cells. Interestingly, many of the signaling pathways worked out in Jurkat cells, particularly in the context of TCR/Ras/MEK/ERK-2 pathways, have been proven to be important as predicted in TCR function in the thymus. We thank Dr. D. Cantrell (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London) for helpful discussion of the results and for critical reading of the manuscript and Veronica Athié-Morales for her skillful help in performing Ras experiments."
