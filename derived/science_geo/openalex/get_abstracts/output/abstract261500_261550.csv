In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, dark anoxia is characterized by the activation of an extensive set of fermentation pathways that act in concert to provide cellular energy, while limiting the accumulation of potentially toxic fermentative products. Metabolite analyses, quantitative PCR, and high density Chlamydomonas DNA microarrays were used to monitor changes in metabolite accumulation and gene expression during acclimation of the cells to anoxia. Elevated levels of transcripts encoding proteins associated with the production of H2, organic acids, and ethanol were observed in congruence with the accumulation of fermentation products. The levels of over 500 transcripts increased significantly during acclimation of the cells to anoxic conditions. Among these were transcripts encoding transcription/translation regulators, prolyl hydroxylases, hybrid cluster proteins, proteases, transhydrogenase, catalase, and several putative proteins of unknown function. Overall, this study uses metabolite, genomic, and transcriptome data to provide genome-wide insights into the regulation of the complex metabolic networks utilized by Chlamydomonas under the anaerobic conditions associated with H2 production.

The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has emerged as a prototype organism for investigating processes such as photosynthesis, nutrient deprivation, flagellar function, and H2 production (1Dent R.M.

Although most studies of Chlamydomonas have been performed under oxic conditions, it is becoming increasingly apparent that photosynthetic microorganisms frequently experience periods of anoxia. In the laboratory, Chlamydomonas cultures may be grown with limited aeration, in low nutrient medium or under low light conditions. Under such conditions, respiratory O2 uptake may exceed the production of O2 by photosynthesis leading to the onset of anoxia (9Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 13Moseley J. Quinn J. Eriksson M. Merchant S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2139-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Quinn J.M. Eriksson M. Moseley J.L. Merchant S. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the natural environment many photosynthetic microorganisms are also exposed to anoxic conditions. For example, in situ studies have demonstrated that cyanobacteria in Octopus Springs at Yellowstone National Park experience anaerobiosis during the night, which triggers a switch from respiratory metabolism and photosynthesis during the day to fermentation metabolism and nitrogen fixation during the night (15Steunou A.S. Bhaya D. Bateson M.M. Melendrez M.C. Ward D.M. Brecht E. Peters J.W. Kuhl M. Grossman A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2398-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Based on the draft genome sequence and available literature (16Atteia A. van Lis R. Gelius-Dietrich G. Adrait A. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Martin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9909-9918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Hemschemeier A. Happe T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is clear that Chlamydomonas contains genes encoding proteins that participate in a diverse set of metabolic pathways. Interestingly, Chlamydomonas contains several genes encoding proteins usually associated with strict anaerobes, including two [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzymes (18Forestier M. King P. Zhang L. Posewitz M. Schwarzer S. Happe T. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Happe T. Kaminski A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1022-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and the corresponding [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation proteins (20Posewitz M.C. King P.W. Smolinski S.L. Smith R.D. Ginley A.R. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 102-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Posewitz M.C. King P.W. Smolinski S.L. Zhang L. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25711-25720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Moreover, Chlamydomonas is a rare example of a eukaryote that has homologs to all four predominant enzymes used in the fermentative metabolism of pyruvate. These include pyruvate formate lyase (PFL1), pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFR1, often designated as PFOR in other organisms), lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC1). Genes encoding subunits of a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are also present in the genome and presumably function in the aerobic metabolism of pyruvate. The Chlamydomonas genome is ∼120 Mb (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Chlre3/Chlre3.home.html) and is predicted to contain over 15,000 genes, with a significant number of genes encoding polypeptides involved in anaerobic metabolism (22Grossman A.R. Croft M. Gladyshev V.N. Merchant S.S. Posewitz M.C. Prochnik S. Spalding M.H. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2007; 10: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A better understanding of anaerobic metabolism in Chlamydomonas and metabolic fluxes associated with diurnal periods of light and dark will facilitate the development of physiological models able to predict metabolic fluxes under various environmental conditions. However, at this point relatively little is known regarding the following: (a) regulatory mechanisms by which phototrophic microorganisms sense and acclimate to an anoxic environment after periods of photosynthetic activity or to an oxic environment after periods of anoxia; (b) the repertoire of genes and proteins required during anaerobiosis and how changes in gene expression link to changing cellular metabolism; and (c) changes in metabolite fluxes and the importance of these fluxes in sustaining cell viability during anaerobiosis. In the laboratory, fermentation pathways become active in Chlamydomonas as the environment becomes anaerobic. This is achieved in the dark by sparging cultures with an inert gas (or exogenous reductant) to purge them of O2 (23Gfeller R.P. Gibbs M.

Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 27Kosourov S. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L.

Planta. 2002; 214: 552-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), which results in attenuated rates of photosynthetic O2 evolution (30Wykoff D.D. Davies J.P. Melis A. Grossman A.R. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In the dark, fermentation is coupled to the degradation of starch reserves (23Gfeller R.P. Gibbs M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 212-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kreutzberg K. Physiologia Plantarum. 1984; 61: 87-94Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32Ohta S. Miyamoto K. Miura Y. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formate, acetate, and ethanol are formed as major fermentative products, and H2 and CO2 gases are emitted as minor products (23Gfeller R.P. Gibbs M. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 212-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kreutzberg K. Physiologia Plantarum. 1984; 61: 87-94Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32Ohta S. Miyamoto K. Miura Y. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These products are also formed in the light after exposure to sulfur deprivation (27Kosourov S. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 146-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The formation of fermentation products is primarily controlled at the level of pyruvate, and the ratios of the fermentative products may change as a consequence of culture conditions and the use of different laboratory strains. The PFL1 enzyme catalyzes the cleavage of pyruvate into formate and acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) (33Wagner A.F. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The acetyl-CoA generated can be reduced to ethanol via acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities. Alternatively, the acetyl-CoA can be converted to acetate via phosphate acetyl-transferase (PAT) 3The abbreviations used are:PATphosphate acetyltransferaseHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyROSreactive oxygen speciesADHalcohol dehydrogenaseHCPhybrid cluster proteinHIFhypoxia-inducible factorPATphosphate acetyltransferaseACKacetate kinaseMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and acetate kinase (ACK), yielding ATP (16Atteia A. van Lis R.

Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Atteia et al. (16Atteia A. van Lis R. Gelius-Dietrich G. Adrait A. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Martin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9909-9918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that the Chlamydomonas genome contains two copies each of the PAT and ACK genes and suggested that the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate likely occurs in both the chloroplast and mitochondrion. It should be noted that the PAT proteins are referred to as phosphotransacetylase in several previous publications, but are annotated as PAT in the current assembly of the Chlamydomonas genome. phosphate acetyltransferase high pressure liquid chromatography reactive oxygen species alcohol dehydrogenase hybrid cluster protein hypoxia-inducible factor phosphate acetyltransferase acetate kinase 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. In Chlamydomonas, pyruvate may also be oxidized to acetyl-CoA and CO2 by PFR1, which was recently identified in the Chlamydomonas genome (16Atteia A. van Lis R. Gelius-Dietrich G. Adrait A. Garin J.

Trans. 2005; 33: 39-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In amitochondriate eukaryotes and anaerobic microbes such as species of Clostridia, PFOR reduces ferredoxin, providing electrons for H2 generation via the catalytic activity of hydrogenase. The accumulation of ethanol and formate and the acidification of the cellular environment by organic acids can be toxic to the cells (34Kennedy R.A. Rumpho M.E. Fox T.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), which requires dynamic responses in cellular metabolism to balance ATP production while limiting the accumulation of toxic metabolites. Anaerobiosis in Chlamydomonas is currently of significant interest as it represents a potential means to generate H2, a biological source of renewable energy. This potential with respect to energy production has stimulated several studies focused on anaerobic metabolism, and the formation and assimilation of H2 in algae (32Ohta S. Miyamoto K. Miura Y. Plant Physiol. 1987; 83: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ben-Amotz A. Avron M. Plant Physiol. 1972; 49: 240-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kessler E. Stewart W.D.P.

In Chlamydomonas, H2 evolution is catalyzed by two [FeFe]-hydrogenases (HYD1 and HYD2) that are localized in the chloroplast stroma and are coupled to electron donation from ferredoxin (18Forestier M. King P. Zhang L. Posewitz M. Schwarzer S. Happe T. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2750-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Happe T. Kaminski A. Eur. J.

The Chlamydomonas hydrogenases are typically designated as HYDA1 and HYDA2 with the “A” indicating the catalytic enzyme. However, the HYD1 and HYD2 nomenclature is used here for consistency with current Chlamydomonas annotations. The HYD1 and HYD2 enzymes are O2-sensitive, and H2 production is only observed under anaerobic conditions (24Ghirardi M.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1997; 63: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Happe T. Mosler B. Naber J.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 40Happe T. Naber J.D. Eur.

Anaerobically maintained Chlamydomonas generates H2 in the light or dark through photosynthetic and fermentative pathways, respectively. Transient H2 photoproduction is observed after illumination of dark, anaerobically acclimated cells grown in nutrient-replete medium (4Happe T. Hemschemeier A. Winkler M. Kaminski A. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 246-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Posewitz M.C. King P.W. Smolinski S.L. Zhang L. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L. J. Biol.

Photobiol. 1989; 50: 571-576Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, H2 production rates rapidly diminish as the O2, generated from photosynthesis increases to inhibitory levels. Photosynthesis-dependent generation of volumetric amounts of H2 by Chlamydomonas occurs upon sulfur deprivation (9Melis A. Zhang L. Forestier M. Ghirardi M.L. Seibert M. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 27Kosourov S. Seibert M. Ghirardi M.L.

Res. 2005; 85: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This activity can be maintained in the light over a period of several days in batch cultures, whereas H2 production in chemostats can be sustained for several months (45Fedorov A. Kosourov S. Ghirardi M. Seibert M. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2005; 121: 403-412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous physiological studies have linked fermentation and photosynthetic electron transport to H2 production in Chlamydomonas, a precise knowledge of the metabolic and regulatory context required for H2 production will be necessary to understand current limitations in H2 yields. In this study, we have combined molecular and physiological approaches to examine dark anoxic acclimation of Chlamydomonas strain CC-425. The ability to generate H2 and the accumulation of extracellular fermentation products were monitored during the acclimation of Chlamydomonas to anaerobic conditions. The levels of transcripts encoding proteins associated with the various fermentation pathways were monitored in conjunction with the formation of these fermentation products. We also used high density, oligonucleotide (70 mer)-based microarrays to obtain insights into the genome-wide responses initiated by anoxia. Although transcripts from a number of genes associated with fermentation metabolism increased, as expected, there was an unanticipated increase in the levels of several transcripts encoding proteins involved in transcriptional/translational regulation, post-translational modification, and stress responses. Insights obtained from the cellular metabolism and gene expression data are being integrated into a larger systems framework that is focused on understanding the flexibility of whole-cell metabolism under rapidly changing environmental conditions. Strains and Growth Conditions—C. reinhardtii CC-425 (cw15, sr-u-60, arg7–8, mt+) wild-type cells were grown in Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium (pH 7.2) (5Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar), supplemented with 200 mg/liter arginine. Algal cultures were maintained at 25 °C, stirred (105 rpm), and exposed to continuous irradiance of 80 μmol m-2 s-1 PAR. Cell suspensions contained 16–24 μg·ml-1 total chlorophyll. Anaerobic Induction of Liquid Cell Suspensions—Chlamydomonas cultures were grown on TAP medium to ∼20 μg·ml-1 total chlorophyll, centrifuged (500 ml of cells) at 2,500 × g for 1 min, and resuspended in one-tenth volume (50 ml) of anaerobic induction buffer (AIB) containing 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), and 3 mm MgCl2 (24Ghirardi M.L. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1997; 63: 141-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrogenase activity was elicited by placing concentrated cells into a vial wrapped with aluminum foil to exclude light. The vial was sealed with a rubber septum, flushed with argon for 15 min, and then incubated anaerobically in the dark at room temperature. For measuring H2 and O2 production rates, aliquots of cell cultures were placed in a Clark-type oxygen electrode assay chamber maintained at 25 °C and containing 2.25 ml of de-oxygenated MOPS buffer (50 mm, pH 6.8). The algal suspension was kept in the dark for 2 min, exposed to ∼700 μmol m-2 s-1 of actinic light filtered through a solution of 1% CuSO4 for 3 min, and then returned to the dark for 1.5 min. Clark-type oxygen electrodes were used simultaneously to measure H2 and O2 production rates. Chlorophyll Measurements—Chlorophyll a and b content was determined spectrophotometrically in 95% ethanol (5Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego1989Google Scholar). Metabolite Analysis—Organic acid analysis was performed by liquid chromatography (Hewlett Packard Series 1050 HPLC) using an Aminex HPX-87H (300 × 7.8 mm) ion exchange column. Anaerobically adapted cells were collected at the indicated times and centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new vial and frozen in liquid N2 for subsequent analysis. Samples were thawed, centrifuged, and filtered prior to HPLC injection. Twenty μl of cell culture supernatant was injected onto the column and eluted with 8 mm filtered sulfuric acid (J. T. Baker Inc.) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml·min-1 at 45 °C. Retention peaks were recorded using Agilent ChemStation software, and quantification was performed by comparisons with known amounts of standards for each of the organic acids. Ethanol was measured using the YSI 2700 SELECT electrochemical probe (YSI Inc.). This system allows direct reading of ethanol in solution at the enzyme sensor. The enzyme alcohol oxidase, which converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, was immobilized on the enzyme membrane. Identical supernatants were used for metabolite and ethanol analysis; 10 μl of the supernatant was required for the measurement. Extraction of RNA for Real Time PCR and Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the plant RNA reagent protocol, as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Approximately 40 μg of isolated RNA was treated with 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Ambion) for 30 min at room temperature. The Qiagen RNeasy MinElute kit (Qiagen) was used to purify DNase-treated total RNA from degraded DNA, tRNA, 5.5 rRNA, DNase, contaminating proteins, and potential inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase reaction. The A260 of the eluted RNA was measured, and 4 μg of purified RNA was reserved to prepare labeled samples for microarray analysis. Reverse Transcription Reactions—First strand cDNA synthesis was primed from purified, total RNA template using specific primers for each of the Chlamydomonas genes of interest (shown as the reverse primers in supplemental Table 1), or with (dT)12–18 for the ferredoxin genes (the genes are designated FDX, with PETF as the exception). The reverse transcription reaction was done using the reverse transcriptase Superscript III kit (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer. The specific primers were annealed to 250 ng of total RNA and extended for 1 h at 55 °C using 200 units of reverse transcriptase Superscript III. (dT)12–18 primers were annealed to 250 ng of total RNA and extended for 1 h at 50 °C using 200 units of reverse transcriptase Superscript III. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Levels of specific transcripts in total mRNA from each sample were quantified by real time PCR using the Engine Opticon system (Bio-Rad). Four μl of single-stranded cDNA from the reverse transcriptase reaction (see above) was used as template for the real time PCR experiments. The real time PCR amplifications were performed using reagents from the DyNAmo HS SYBR green real time PCR kit (Finnzymes). Specific primers were designed to amplify gene regions consisting of 100–200 nucleotides. Amplifications were performed using the following cycling parameters: an initial single step at 95 °C for 10 min (denaturation) was followed by 40 cycles of the following: (a) 94 °C for 10 s (denaturation), (b) 56 °C for 15 s (primer annealing for the RACK1, HYD1, HYD2, HYDEF, HYDG, PFL1, PFR1, PAT1, ACK2, PETF, FDX2, FDX3, FDX4, FDX5, FDX6, AMYB1, AMYB3, ADH1, CAT1, ppGpp synthetase/degradase, TAB2, HCP4, PDC1, and NADTH genes) or 54 °C for 15 s (primer annealing for the PAT2, ACK1, and PFLA genes), and (c) 72 °C for 15 s (elongation). Annotations associated with these genes are described elsewhere in the text and figure legends. A final single step at 72 °C for 10 min followed these 40 cycles. Melting curve analyses were performed on all PCRs to ensure that single DNA species were amplified, and the product sizes were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The relative expression ratio of a target gene was calculated based on the 2-ΔΔCT method (46Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (Amsterdam). 2001; 25: 402-408Google Scholar), using the average cycle threshold (CT) calculated from triplicate measurements. Relative expression ratios from three independent experiments are reported. The RACK1 gene, previously named CBLP, was used as a constitutive control gene for normalization. The primers used for reverse transcription and real time PCR are described in supplemental Table 1 and were designed using Primer3 software. Microarray Fabrication—Microarrays were fabricated at the Stanford Functional Genomics Facility at Stanford University. Oligonucleotides to be printed were suspended in 8 μl of 3× SSC on a Beckman Coulter BioMek FX liquid handling robot to a concentration of ∼50 μm. The print material was deposited onto Corning GAPS II or UltraGAPS slides using a custom-built microarray robot equipped with Majer Precision MicroQuill 2000 array pins. Replicate spots were created by printing the entire plate set twice in succession. The “.gal” file, which reports the specific genes (and gene models when available) and their location on the array as well as gene annotation information, is available on line. Printed slides were maintained in a desiccator. Prior to use, slides were hydrated in a humidity chamber (100% humidity) for 5 min followed by immediate snap drying on a 100 °C hot plate (∼3 s, array side up), and the array elements were then UV cross-linked to the aminosilane surface of the slide at 600 mJ using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Labeling and Purification of Reverse-transcribed cDNAs—Labeling and purification of reverse-transcribed cDNAs were performed as described previously (47Eberhard S. Jain M. Im C.S. Pollock S. Shrager J. Lin Y. Peek A.S. Grossman A.R. Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 106-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Four micrograms of purified RNA was adjusted to 4 μl with sterile milliQ-treated water. One microliter of oligo-dT(V) (2 μg·μl-1), consisting of 23 consecutive T residues followed at the 3′ end by an A, T, G, or C, was added to the solution prior to heating the reaction mixture for 10 min at 70 °C and then quickly chilled the mixture on ice. The following reagents were then added to the reaction mixture: 2 μl of 5× superscript buffer; 1 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 0.2 μl of 50× dNTPs (5 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and 10 mm dTTP), 1 μl of Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP, and 0.8 μl of Superscript III (200 units·μl-1); the final reaction volume was 10 μl. After allowing the reaction to proceed at 42 °C for 2 h, an additional aliquot of 0.5 μl Superscript III was added, and the reaction was continued for an additional 1 h at 50 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 μl of 500 mm EDTA and 0.5 μl of 500 mm NaOH, and the solution was incubated at 70 °C for 10 min to degrade RNA. Neutralization of the reaction mixture was achieved by adding 0.5 μl of 500 mm HCl. The QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) was used to purify labeled cDNA. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were mixed with 90 μl of DNase-free water and 500 μl of Buffer PB (from kit), and the solution was immediately placed onto a QIAquick column. The column was washed with 750 μl of kit Buffer PE by centrifugation at maximum speed for 1 min, and the flow-through was discarded. The wash procedure was repeated, and the colu"
https://openalex.org/W1967159107,"Dysregulation of the proteasome has been documented in a variety of human diseases such as Alzheimer, muscle atrophy, cataracts etc. Proteolytic activity of 26 S proteasome is ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent. O-GlcNAcylation of Rpt2, one of the AAA ATPases in the 19 S regulatory cap, shuts off the proteasome through the inhibition of ATPase activity. Thus, through control of the flux of glucose into O-GlcNAc, the function of the proteasome is coupled to glucose metabolism. In the present study we found another metabolic control of the proteasome via cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Contrary to O-Glc-NAcylation, PKA activated proteasomes both in vitro and in vivo in association with the phosphorylation at Ser120 of another AAA ATPase subunit, Rpt6. Mutation of Ser120 to Ala blocked proteasome function. The stimulatory effect of PKA and the phosphorylation of Rpt6 were reversible by protein phosphatase 1γ. Thus, hormones using the PKA system can also regulate proteasomes often in concert with glucose metabolism. This finding might lead to novel strategies for the treatment of proteasome-related diseases."

To test the hypothesis that ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1 protect the anterior segment of the eye against environmentally induced oxidative damage, Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out and Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-) single knock-out mice were evaluated for biochemical changes and cataract formation (lens opacification). The Aldh1a1/Aldh3a1- and Aldh3a1-null mice develop cataracts in the anterior and posterior subcapsular regions as well as punctate opacities in the cortex by 1 month of age. The Aldh1a1-null mice also develop cataracts later in life (6–9 months of age). One- to three-month-old Aldh-null mice exposed to UVB exhibited accelerated anterior lens subcapsular opacification, which was more pronounced in Aldh3a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-)/Aldh1a1(-/-) mice compared with Aldh1a1(-/-) and wild type animals. Cataract formation was associated with decreased proteasomal activity, increased protein oxidation, increased GSH levels, and increased levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal- and malondialdehyde-protein adducts. In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that corneal ALDH3A1 and lens ALDH1A1 protect the eye against cataract formation via nonenzymatic (light filtering) and enzymatic (detoxification) functions.

In conclusion, these findings support the hypothesis that corneal ALDH3A1 and lens ALDH1A1 protect the eye against cataract formation via nonenzymatic (light filtering) and enzymatic (detoxification) functions. The cornea serves as a physical and biochemical protective barrier between the external milieu and internal ocular tissues. The anterior segment of the eye absorbs the major fraction of the UV light entering the eye and acts as a filter, protecting the lens and retina from UV-induced damage (1Ringvold A. Acta Ophthalmol. Scand. 1998; 76: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). UV radiation-induced pathologic changes in the eye are associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are:ROSreactive oxygen speciesLPOlipid peroxidationSODsuperoxide dismutase4-HNE4-hydroxy-2-nonenalMDAmalondialdehydeGCSγ-glutamylcysteine synthaseWTwild type. that cause lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein modification and denaturation, and DNA damage (2Spector A.

These effects may cause reduction of corneal epithelial cell viability and cell death by apoptotic pathways (4Shinohara T. Singh D.P. Chylack Jr., L.T. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as well as protein denaturation with the loss of tertiary structural relationships in the lens fibers, essential for transparency (3Spector A. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Exposure to solar radiation, particularly within the UV wavelengths, is a risk factor for the development of age-related cataracts and macular degeneration in the retina as well as some corneal diseases (5Cruickshanks K.J.

The cornea expresses several proteins that minimize the damaging effects of UV radiation to the more internal structures. The corneas of all mammals are rich in antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, that protect other proteins against the oxidative effects of ROS generated by UV light (7Buddi R. Lin B. Atilano S.R. Zorapapel N.C. Kenney M.C. Brown D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Nuclear ferritin, detected in chicken corneal epithelium, protects against UV-induced DNA oxidative damage (8Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1037-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The corneal epithelium of most mammalian species expresses low molecular weight scavengers of ROS, such as glutathione, α-tocopherol, ascorbate, and NADPH (9van Haaften R.I. Haenen G.R. Evelo C.T. Bast A. Drug Metab. Rev. 2003; 35: 215-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Ringvold A. Anderssen E. Kjonniksen I. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 2774-2777PubMed Google Scholar). NADPH is essential for the regeneration of GSH from its oxidized form (GSSG) through the glutathione reductase/peroxidase system, serving as an indirect antioxidant by maintaining the reducing power of GSH (11Atherton S.J. Lambert C. Schultz J. Williams N. Zigman S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). NADPH may also function as a direct antioxidant by reducing glutathiyl and tyrosyl radicals generated during oxidative stress (12Kirsch M. De G.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1569-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Additionally, this molecule directly absorbs UV light (11Atherton S.J. Lambert C. Schultz J. Williams N. Zigman S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 823-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and protects biomolecules through direct binding. For example, bound NADPH is known to offset H2O2-induced inactivation of catalase (13Kirkman H.N. Rolfo M. Ferraris A.M. Gaetani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13908-13914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Corneal crystallins, which are proteins expressed in high levels similar to lens crystallins, are thought to also play a protective role against UV-induced damage (14Piatigorsky J. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, a bovine corneal crystallin, plays a protective role against UV-induced oxidative injury by preventing LPO, protein oxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and intracellular peroxide generation (15Lee S.M. Koh H.J. Park D.C. Song B.J. Huh T.L. Park J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Albumin, the most prevalent protein in the corneal stroma, may serve as an antioxidant scavenger of hydrogen peroxide and protects the cornea against oxidative damage (16Nees D.W. Fariss R.N. Piatigorsky J. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 3339-3345Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two aldehyde dehydrogenases, ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1, are of interest (17King G. Holmes R. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 12-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Piatigorsky J. J. Ocul. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 16: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ALDH3A1 represents 5–50% of the corneal water-soluble proteins in mammalian species (19Piatigorsky J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), although it appears to be absent from the lens, whereas ALDH1A1 is found mainly in the lens and to a lesser extent (<5%) in the cornea (17King G. Holmes R. J. Exp. Zool. 1998; 282: 12-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Early studies have suggested a protective role of ALDH3A1 against UV-induced damage in the cornea. SWR/J mice are susceptible to UV-induced cornea clouding (20Downes J.E. Swann P.G. Holmes R.S. Cornea. 1994; 13: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), apparently from a lack of stable ALDH3A1 expression due to several mutations in the Aldh3a1 gene (21Shiao T. Tran P. Siegel D. Lee J. Vasiliou V. Pharmacogenetics. 1999; 9: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar, 22Pappa A. Sophos N.A. Vasiliou V. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the biological basis is not well characterized, one established mechanism by which both ALDH3A1 and ALDH1A1 protect the corneal epithelium from UV-induced oxidative damage is the detoxification of highly reactive products of LPO, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA). ALDH3A1 metabolizes 4-HNE (23Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), whereas ALDH1A1 metabolizes both 4-HNE and MDA (24Manzer R. Qamar L. Estey T. Pappa A. Petersen D.R. Vasiliou V. DNA Cell. Biol. 2003; 22: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of ALDH1A1 may complement one or more of the functions ascribed to ALDH3A1 and may provide a means of oxidizing MDA, which is a poor substrate of ALDH3A1 (23Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Possible additional functions of ocular ALDH3A1 include direct absorption of UV radiation, chaperone-like activity, and scavenging of UV-generated ROS via the -SH groups of the cysteine and methionine residues (reviewed in Ref. 25Estey T. Piatigorsky J. Lassen N. Vasiliou V. Exp. Eye Res. 2006; 84: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Herein, we establish that the Aldh1a1(-/-), and Aldh3a1(-/-) single knock-outs as well as the Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice develop premature cataracts (lens opacification), documenting the importance of these proteins and their combined roles in preventing ocular toxicity. These studies have important implications for cataract formation in humans. Animals—Transgenic Aldh1a1(-/-), Aldh3a1(-/-), and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice and their wild type counterparts (C57BL/6JX129/sv) were bred. Generation of Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-) single knock-out animals has been previously described (26Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 27Nees D.W. Wawrousek E.F. Robison Jr., W.G. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice were generated by breeding F3 homozygous hybrids of Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-) mice. C57BL/6JX129/sv mice are F3 hybrids of control C57BL/6J and 129/sv mice, the genetic background of all knock-out lines used in this study. Animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled room (21–22 °C) on a 12-h light/dark cycle and supplied with food and water ad libitum. Four to twenty animals of each genetic strain and gender, at various ages, were used for each experiment. All animal use was conducted in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado and was performed according to the published National Institutes of Health guidelines. Clinical Assessment of Cornea and Lens—The clinical transparency of the cornea and lens in the wild type, Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh3a1(-/-) single knock-out, and double knock-out mice of 1–3 and 6–9 months of age was assessed using slit lamp biomicroscopy (FS-2; Nikon, Melville, NY). Mydriasis was induced by a topical application of 1:1 solution of 1% tropicamide (Alcon, Forth Worth, TX) and 10% phenylephrine (Akorn, Buffalo Grove, IL) in conscious animals. Observations lasted 3–5 min per eye and were recorded by a digital camera. To avoid bias, the observer was “blinded” to the genetic background of the mice being examined. To assess the extent of lens opacification, a cataract scoring system ranging from 0 to 3 (where 0 = no opacity, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) based on slit lamp biomicroscopy was utilized. The assessment was made during the examination to minimize misinterpretation of photographic light and positional artifacts. Animals were randomly reexamined for consistency during the assessment. The anterior, middle, and posterior regions of the lens were examined. Quantitative analyses of light scattering from cornea and lens were performed by selecting a line of pixels through the center of the eye with cornea peaks normalized to an arbitrary value of 100, assuming that all images had the same corneal clarity (28Alizadeh A. Clark J. Seeberger T. Hess J. Blankenship T. Fitzgerald P.G. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Protein Studies—To determine any changes in protein expression due to the absence of ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 proteins, corneal and lenticular expression of alcohol dehydrogenase and aldose reductase, which are two major 4-HNE-metabolizing enzymes, as well as antioxidant enzymes (catalase, Cu,Zn-SOD, and glutathione peroxidase) and corneal crystallins (transketolase) were evaluated in all Aldh genetic stocks by Western blot and SDS-PAGE analyses. Preparation of Tissue Extracts—Wild type, Aldh1a1(-/-), Aldh3a1(-/-), and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Corneas and lenses were then immediately removed from enucleated eyes by circumferential sclerotomy posterior to the limbus. Lenses (from one animal), and corneas (pooled from at least three animals) were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose (pH 7.4), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Lysates were sonicated for 5 so nice using a Branson sonifier 250 (VWR Scientific, Willard, OH) and then cooled on ice for 15 s for a total of three cycles. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were collected for analysis by Western blotting. Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA method (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—For silver staining, 10 μg of protein was loaded and subjected to electrophoresis using a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For Western blot analysis, 10–30 μg of protein from lens and cornea were subjected to electrophoresis and immunoblotted according to previously described methods (29Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies included affinity-purified rabbit anti-ALDH1A1 (26Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), monoclonal and polyclonal anti-ALDH3A1 (23Pappa A. Estey T. Manzer R. Brown D. Vasiliou V. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma), antibodies to Cu,Zn-SOD (Calbiochem), Mn-SOD, aldose reductase (a gift from Dr. M. Petrash, University of Washington, St. Louis, MO), catalase (Research Diagnostic, Concord, MA), glutathione peroxidase (Cortex Biochem, San Leandro, CA), transketolase (30Xu Z.P. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6142-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), alcohol dehydrogenase (31Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (GCS) (a gift from Dr. T. Kavanagh, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Anti-rabbit, anti-sheep, and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G-conjugated horse-radish peroxidase antibodies were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). ALDH3A1 Enzymatic Assay—ALDH3A1 activity was determined using either 5 mm benzaldehyde (substrate) and 2.5 mm NADP+ (coenzyme) or 5 mm propionaldehyde (substrate) and 1 mm NAD+ (coenzyme) as described previously (29Pappa A. Chen C. Koutalos Y. Townsend A.J. Vasiliou V. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1178-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). ALDH3A1 activity was normalized to total protein concentration measured by the BCA method (Pierce). Determination of Reduced GSH Levels—Eyes from wild type, Aldh1a1(-/-), Aldh3a1(-/-), and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice 6 months of age were excised, and the lenses and corneas were separated and combined for each animal. The tissues were weighed using an analytical scale (model CAHN C-33; Waltham, MA), sonicated on ice in KPBS buffer (50 mm KH2PO4, 50 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.4, 17.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm serine, and 50 mm boric acid), and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of monobromobimane (for the development of the GSH-monobromobimane derivative). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 70% perchloric acid, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant solution was removed and analyzed for GSH on a Hitachi high pressure liquid chromatograph (model L-2420; San Jose, CA) equipped with a fluorometric detector (model L-2480) as previously described with minor modifications (32Day B.J. van Heeckeren A.M. Min E. Velsor L.W. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2045-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Determination of Protein-Carbonyls and 4-HNE- and MDA-adducted Proteins—Lenses were dissected from 6-month-old wild type and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice, and the soluble and insoluble fractions were processed as previously described (33Gerido D.A. Sellitto C. Li L. White T.W. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 2669-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of samples from each animal strain were processed for detection of carbonyl groups using the Oxyblot® detection kit (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA). Briefly, the soluble and insoluble fractions were treated with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine to derivatize the carbonyl groups to 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone-derivatized protein samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed using specific antibody for the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone-derivatized residues of oxidatively damaged proteins. The same samples were processed for detection of 4-HNE and MDA adducts by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibodies developed against 4-HNE- and MDA-adducted proteins (a gift from Dr. D. Petersen, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Labeled proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Proteasome Activity Assay—Lens homogenates from wild type, Aldh1a1(-/-), and Aldh3a1(-/-) single and double knock-out mice were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml in PBS and assayed for chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity as described previously (34Bulteau A.L. Moreau M. Nizard C. Friguet B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1157-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The chymotrypsin-like activity was measured using a fluorogenic substrate, succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-amido-methylcoumarin (Sigma). Samples were assayed at 37 °C for 1 h in a black 96-well plate (Costar; Corning Inc.) using a temperature-controlled fluorescence plate reader (Spectra MAX Gemini EM, Sunnyvale, CA). The measured excitation and the emission wavelengths were 360 and 430 nm, respectively. Identical samples were prepared with the proteasome inhibitor, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal (MG132; Sigma), to determine specific activity to proteasome degradation. UVB Exposure—One- to three-month-old wild type, Aldh1a1(-/-), and Aldh3a1(-/-) single and double knock-out mice were exposed to UVB light for 2.5 min (0.05 J/cm2) and 10 min (0.2 J/cm2), and lens opacification was evaluated 12 and 48 h after UV exposure by slit lamp biomicroscopy. Animals were first anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of xylazine (10 mg/kg) and ketamine (150 mg/kg) and were placed directly under the UV lamp with the head propped on its side so that each eye faced the lamp one at a time. Both eyes were exposed to equal amounts of energy. The UV source (a 115-V, 60-Hz, 0.16-A non-ozone-producing lamp with a peak wavelength of 302 nm; UVP Inc., San Gabriel, CA) was mounted horizontally in an enclosed box. The distance from the lamp to the eye was 27 cm. The energy output of the lamp at this distance was measured to be 350 milliwatts/cm2 using a UVX digital radiometer attached to a UVX-31 300-nm sensor (UVP Inc.). Heat transmission from the lamp to the bottom of the box was negligible. In addition, the chymotrypsin-like activity of the lens 20 S proteasome was determined. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Statistical analyses were done using Sigmastat®, version 3.10 (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA), or SAS®, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All comparisons of mean (or median, if not normally distributed) values between groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance (or Kruskal-Wallis test based on ranks), with post hoc pairwise comparisons based on Bonferroni's t test. A comparison of the proportion of mice with lens opacification between single or double knock-out mice and control mice was performed using Fisher's exact test. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Each experiment was repeated three times. Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) Double Knock-out Mice—The tail DNA analyses of the mice (Fig. 1) confirmed the genotype of the double knock-out and wild type mice. The Aldh1a1 genotype was determined by Southern blot analysis (26Fan X. Molotkov A. Manabe S. Donmoyer C.M. Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Cuenca A.E. Blaner W.S. Lipton S.A. Duester G. Mol. Cell.

The homozygous mutant mice were born alive in the expected Mendelian gender ratio with no malformations or reduced survival or growth, indicating that Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) double knock-out mice are healthy and fertile. The absence of ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 proteins in the double knock-out mice in lens and cornea was verified using silver staining (Fig. 1A) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). ALDH1A1 protein (55 kDa) was missing from the lens of Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice; ALDH3A1 (51 kDa) was missing from the cornea of the Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice but not from the cornea of Aldh1a1(-/-) mice (Fig. 1A). It is also obvious that no other new proteins are present in the area of ∼50 kDa in either cornea or lens of the Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice as a compensatory mechanism. Immunoblot analyses using specific antibodies confirmed that the Aldh1a1/Aldh3a1-null mutant was generated (Fig. 1B). ALDH1A1 was detected in the lens and cornea of the wild type and Aldh3a1(-/-) mice but not in Aldh1a1(-/-) and Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice. ALDH3A1 was detected in the cornea but not in the lens of wild type and in Aldh1a1(-/-) mice. As expected, ALDH3A1 was absent from the cornea and lens of Aldh3a1(-/-) and double knock-out mice. No traces of ALDH enzymatic activity were detected in the cornea or lens of Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice using benzaldehyde and NADP+ or propionaldehyde and NAD+ as substrates and coenzymes, respectively (Table 1), which suggests that no compensation by any other ALDH has occurred in the Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice.TABLE 1ALDH activity in cornea and lens in wild type (WT) and Aldh1a1(–/–)/Aldh3a1(–/–) double knock-out mice (DKO)SubstrateActivityaSpecific activities are expressed as nmol of NAD(P)H/min/mg protein as mean ± S.E. from triplicates in three separate experiments and were assayed using benzaldehyde and NADP+ or propionaldehyde and NAD+ as substrates and coenzymes, respectivelynmol NAD(P)H/min/mg proteinNADP+/benzaldehyde WT cornea3430.5 ± 3.1 WT lens9.1 ± 3.6 DKO corneaNDbND, no enzymatic activity detected DKO lensNDNAD+/propionaldehyde WT cornea853.7 ± 9.9 WT lens2.9 ± 8.6 DKO corneaND DKO lensNDa Specific activities are expressed as nmol of NAD(P)H/min/mg protein as mean ± S.E. from triplicates in three separate experiments and were assayed using benzaldehyde and NADP+ or propionaldehyde and NAD+ as substrates and coenzymes, respectivelyb ND, no enzymatic activity detected Open table in a new tab Lenticular Opacification—Two age groups of mice (1–3 and 6–9 months old) were evaluated for cataract phenotype by slit lamp biomicroscopy. We quantified the cataract phenotype using a grading scale ranging from 0 to 3 (where 0 = no opacity, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = advanced). The lenses of wild type mice were clear in most animals, although a 17 and 26% incidence of cataract was detected in the young and older animals, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). The Aldh1a1(-/-) mice had a consistent lenticular opacification detected in ∼63% of the older mice only (Table 2). Cataract was almost undetectable in young Aldh1a1(-/-) mice, whereas older animals developed mild anterior subcapsular cataract as compared with the age-matched wild type counterpart (supplemental Table 1B and Fig. 2B). Cataract was observed in Aldh3a1(-/-) mice as early as 1 month of age as compared with wild type mice; this opacification was severe in older mice as compared with both younger Aldh3a1(-/-) and wild type mice (Table 2). Approximately 60 and 80% of the young and old Aldh3a1-null mice, respectively, had mild to moderate lens opacification in the anterior subcapsular region (supplemental Table 1, A and B, and Fig. 2C). The Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) mice exhibited the highest proportion of cataracts at all ages with the location being anterior subcapsular cataract, as compared with wild type mice (Fig. 2D, Table 2, and supplemental Table 1, A and B). The cataract incidence was higher in older (94%) than in younger mice (79%) in the double knock-out as compared with wild type mice (Table 2). By quantitative analyses, opacification in the anterior portion of the lens was denser in the double knock-out Aldh1a1(-/-)/Aldh3a1(-/-) as compared with single knock-out Aldh1a1(-/-) or Aldh3a1(-/-) and wild type mice (Fig. 2, A–D). Cataract morphology was documented in the anterior subcapsular and posterior capsular regions in a double knock-out mouse of more than 12 months of age (supplemental Fig. 2). Anterior subcapsular lenticular opacities (supplemental Fig. 2B) and punctate, refractile opacities were visible in the posterior cortex (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D) in contrast with the embryonal nucleus, which was relatively clear (supplemental Fig. 2, B and C). Age-matched wild type mice had clear lenses, although a small proportion developed mild cataracts with age (data not shown).TABLE 2Cataract detection in wild type, Aldh1a1(–/–), and Aldh3a1(–/–) single and Aldh1a1(–/–)/Aldh3a1(–/–) double knock-out (DKO) mice by in vivo slit lamp biomicroscopy Cataract was documented in wild type, Aldh1a1(–/–), and Aldh3a1(–/–) single and Aldh1a1(–/–)/Aldh3a1(–/–) double knock-out mice 1–3 and 6–9 months of age.AgeGenotypeTotal miceMice with cataractPercentagep valueap values comparing proportion of mice with cataracts among Aldh1a1(–/–) and Aldh3a1(–/–) single and double knock-out mice versus wild type mice (Fisher's exact test). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

https://openalex.org/W2023557746,"The regulation of PTEN intrinsic biochemical properties has not been fully elucidated. In this report, we investigated the role of the PTEN carboxyl-terminal tail domain in regulating its membrane targeting and catalytic functions. Characterization of a panel of PTEN phosphorylation site mutants revealed that mutating Ser-385 to alanine (S385A) promoted membrane localization in vivo and phosphatase activity in vitro. Furthermore, S385A mutation was associated with a substantial reduction in the phosphorylation of the Ser-380/Thr-382/Thr-383 cluster. Therefore, Ser-385 could prime additional dephosphorylation events to regulate PTEN catalytic activity. Moreover, substituting Ser-380/Thr-382/Thr-383 to phosphomimic residues reversed the phosphatase activity of the S385A mutation. Next, we further defined the underlying mechanisms responsible for the COOH-terminal tail region in modulating PTEN biological activity. We have identified an interaction between the 71-amino acid carboxyl-terminal tail region and the CBRIII motif of the C2 domain, which has been implicated in membrane binding. In addition, a synthetic phosphomimic peptide encompassing the phosphorylation site cluster between amino acids 368 and 390 within the tail region mediated the suppression of PTEN catalytic activity in vitro. This same peptide when expressed in cultured cells also impeded PTEN membrane localization and enhanced phospho-Akt levels. Thus, our data suggest that the COOH-terminal tail can act as an autoinhibitory domain to control both PTEN membrane recruitment and phosphatase activity.

The mechanism by which PTEN targets the plasma membrane is under intense investigation. In addition, how the intrinsic catalytic activity of PTEN is regulated has not been fully delineated. The resolution of the PTEN crystal structure has provided biophysical data in identifying functional motifs responsible for mediating PTEN membrane binding (12Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). PTEN possesses in its carboxyl terminus between amino acids (aa) 186 and 351 a C2 domain, which is similar to that found in phospholipase C81. In particular, the conserved CBRIII loop possesses five positively charged and two hydrophobic residues that are implicated in phospholipids binding (12Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M.

A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Additional positively charged residues interfacing the lipid bilayer at Arg-161, Lys-163, and Lys-164 have been shown to contribute to membrane binding through electrostatic interactions (14Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7491-7496Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Consequently, these interactions orient the catalytic pocket toward the lipid bilayer. Based on protease sensitivity assays, the 7-aa NH2-terminal and 49-aa COOH-terminal regions of PTEN are unstructured and therefore unable to be crystallized (12Lee J.O. Yang H. Georgescu M.M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J.E. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, structure-functional analysis of these regions has implicated their involvement in membrane binding and PTEN biological activities. The NH2-terminal 16-aa polybasic region constitutes a PIP2-binding motif that is essential for PTEN tumor suppressor function. Deletion of this region or the acquisition of a tumor-associated Lys → Glu-13 mutation greatly reduces PTEN membrane binding and tumor suppressing activity (15Walker S.M. Leslie N.R. Perera N.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). PIP2 binding to this motif greatly stimulates the intrinsic catalytic activity of PTEN (16Campbell R.B. Liu F. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33617-33620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Iijima M. Huang Y.E. Luo H.R. Vazquez F. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16606-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The fact that PIP2 fails to stimulate PTEN when a soluble lipid substrate, inositol 1,3,4,5-trisphosphate, was used argues for a role of a PIP2-rich membrane in orientating the catalytic pocket of PTEN toward the lipid bilayer (18Iijima M.

However, it has also been suggested that PIP2 may activate PTEN through an allosteric mechanism (16Campbell R.B. Liu F. Ross A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33617-33620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). All of these findings favor an interfacial activation mechanism of PTEN at the lipid bilayer involving interactions of multiple membrane binding moieties (19McConnachie G. Pass I. Walker S.M. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal 63-aa region (aa 347-399) of PTEN was initially referred to as the PEST domain (20Vazquez F.

There are six phosphorylation sites at Thr-366, Ser-370, Ser-380, Thr-382, Thr-383, and Ser-385 that are implicated in modulating PTEN tumor suppressor functions, subcellular distribution, and stability. In general, PTEN mutants with these sites substituted with nonphosphorylatable amino acids have greater tumor suppressor activity, enhanced membrane affinity, and reduced protein stability (14Das S.

The biochemical basis for these observations is believed to be the result of a more open conformation displayed by these mutants (17Vazquez F. Devreotes P. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1523-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Vazquez F. Grossman S.R. Takahashi Y. Rokas M.V. Nakamura N. Sellers W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48627-48630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, whether these phosphorylation sites contribute to the intrinsic catalytic activity of PTEN remained to be determined. By mass spectroscopy, two casein kinase II sites at Ser-370 and Ser-385 have been shown to be preferentially phosphorylated in vivo (30Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The biological relevance of phosphorylation at Ser-370 and Ser-385 is not well defined, although a double mutant of S370A/S385A has been shown to have shorter half-life than the wild-type protein (24Torres J. Pulido R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 993-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Additional phosphorylation sites at Ser-362 and Thr-366 have been reported to be the targets of glycogen synthase kinase-3. It is speculated that phosphorylation at these sites constitutes a negative feedback mechanism in attenuating signaling events initiated by insulin-like growth factor (29Al-Khouri A.M. Ma Y. Togo S.H. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35195-35202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ROCK has been shown to phosphorylate Ser-229, Thr-232, Thr-319, and Thr-321 within the C2 domain of PTEN in cells exposed to chemoattractants (31Li Z. Dong X. Wang Z. Liu W. Deng N. Ding Y. Tang L. Hla T. Zeng R. Li L. Wu D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2005; 7: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The cluster of Ser-380, Thr-382, and Thr-383 residues in the tail region are minor phosphorylation sites (29Al-Khouri A.M. Ma Y. Togo S.H. Williams S. Mustelin T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35195-35202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 30Miller S.J. Lou D.Y. Seldin D.C. Lane W.S. Neel B.G. Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc. 2002; 528: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, leptin has recently been reported to stimulate their phosphorylation, resulting in the inhibition of PTEN catalytic activity (32Ning K. Miller L.C. Laidlaw H.A. Burgess L.A. Perera N.M. Downes C.P. Leslie N.R. Ashford M.L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2377-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Thr-383 has been identified as a putative autodephosphorylation site for PTEN, since its dephosphorylation greatly enhances the ability of PTEN to suppress cell migration in human glioblastoma cell lines (33Raftopoulou M. Etienne-Manneville S. Self A. Nicholls S. Hall A. Science. 2004; 303: 1179-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). There is still considerable uncertainty in how the COOH-terminal domain of PTEN regulates its biochemical function. In this report, we provide evidence that this tail region mediates intramolecular interactions with the C2 domain. In addition, the PEST domain rich in acidic residues can serve as an autoinhibitory motif in suppressing PTEN catalytic activity. Cell Cultures—The PTEN-null human prostate carcinoma cell line PC3 and human kidney epithelial cell line 293T were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection of 293T cells, ∼106 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates with 10 μg of DNA using 12 μl of Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) in 6 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 4 h. Cells were lysed after 48 h of incubation. For gene transfer in PC3 cells, ∼105 cells on a 6-well plate were transfected with 2-4 μg of DNA using 2 μl of Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) in 1 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 4 h. Cells were analyzed after 48 h of incubation. Plasmids—The construction of the PTEN-WT cDNA has been described previously (22Tolkacheva T. Chan A.M.

For the generation of PTEN S370A, S380A, T382A, T383A, S385A, S370A/S385A, S380A/T382A/T383A, S380E, S385E, S380D/T382E/T383E, S385A, and CBR3 mutants, standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used. All PTEN mutant cDNAs were restriction-digested with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes and cloned into the BglII and EcoRI sites of the expression vector, pCEFL-KZ-AU5. The MYR-PTEN was constructed by fusing an adaptor, agcttctcgaggccgccaccatggggagtagcaagagcaagcctaaggaccccagccagcgcg, containing the myristoylation signal peptide (GSSKSKPKDPSQR) in the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pCEFL-KZ-AU5-PTEN expression plasmid. The ΔN16-PTEN mutant was generated by a tandem PCR-based strategy using two overlapping primers to delete the NH2-terminal 16 aa of PTEN: aaaagcttctcgaggccgccaccatgggatcc accgacttctacctaaagagatcc and ttctacctaaagagatccatgcaagaggatggattcgactta. The PCR fragment was cloned into the HindIII and BglII sites of pCEFL-KZ-AU5-PTEN. GFP-Cp23 and GFP-Cp23/385E expression plasmids were generated by subcloning cDNA fragments encompassing aa 368-390 of PTEN into the BglII-EcoRI sites of the pEGFP expression vector (Clontech). Antibodies—The anti-PTEN mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cascade Bioscience) the anti-Ser(P)-380/Thr(P)-382/Thr(P)-383-PTEN polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), the anti-Ser(P)-385-PTEN polyclonal antibody (AnaSpec), the anti-AU5 monoclonal antibody (Covance), the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), the polyclonal α-AKT, the polyclonal α-Thr(P)-308-AKT (Cell Signaling), the anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the anti-lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma) antibodies were purchased from commercial sources. The anti-PTEN rabbit polyclonal antibody, GPC07, was raised against a fusion protein of GST and the COOH-terminal 216 aa of PTEN. The anti-Ser(P)-380-PTEN antibody was generated using the phosphopeptide EPDHYRYpSDTTDSD (where pS represents phosphoserine) as the immunogen (Research Genetics). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were solubilized in buffer A: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4), 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate (Na4P2O7), and 10 mm sodium fluoride (NaF). 1 mg of total protein was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of α-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) or α-PTEN polyclonal antibody for 5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were absorbed onto 30 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer, boiled in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and subjected to Western blotting analysis. Hypotonic Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were scraped in a hypotonic buffer composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm Na4P2O7, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cell extracts were homogenized with 30 strokes in a glass Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 50 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in a Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, and 10 mm NaF) and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was the membrane fraction. Sucrose Gradient—Cells were scraped in an extraction buffer (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, and 10 mm NaF) for 20 min on ice. The extracts were homogenized by 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and sucrose was adjusted to 40%. The samples were placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and step sucrose gradient (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) was layered on top. The samples were centrifuged for 18 h at 34,000 × g at 4 °C. A 1-ml fraction was collected, diluted 1:1 with 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and centrifuged again at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets for each fraction were resuspended in 1× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting. Saponin Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% saponin, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, and 10 mm NaF for 20 min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g. The supernatant was collected as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF and centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g. The supernatant was collected as the membrane fraction. Nuclear-Cytosolic Fractionation—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared using the NE-PER fractionation kit (Pierce) according to a modified manufacturer’s protocol. Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cells were plated on polylysine-coated glass coverslips. Following fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-AU5 (1:500). Bound antibody was detected with an Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Specimens were mounted onto glass slides and analyzed by confocal microscopy on a Leica TCS-SP inverted microscope with a ×63 objective. Purification of Recombinant PTEN and C-tail from Bacteria—BL21 bacteria harboring pET15B-His-PTEN or pET15B-His-C-tail were grown to A600 = 0.5-0.7 and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 25 °C, pelleted, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were lysed by sonication, and Triton X-100 and NaCl were adjusted to 1% and 350 mm, respectively. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g, and supernatant was treated with 20 μg/μl DNase I for 1 h at 4 °C. PTEN was purified on a HisTrap HP column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 20-500 mm imidazole gradient. The monomeric protein was isolated through gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Recombinant PTEN from Insect Cells—Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses harboring His-tagged PTEN WT, S370A, T382A, T382A, T383A, S385A, S370A/S385A, and S380A/T382A/T383A expression plasmids for 5-7 days. Cells were lysed in buffer A, and monomeric PTEN was purified as described above. PTEN purified by this method has an average PIP3 phosphatase activity of ∼1.3 pmol/ng/min. Phosphatase Activity Assay—Recombinant PTEN was incubated with 50 μm synthetic diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3 (Echelon) with or without 50 μm synthetic diC8-PI(4,5)P2 (Echelon), both in soluble form for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction buffer was in 10 mm dithiothreitol and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The reaction was stopped with 100 μl of malachite green reagent (Echelon). The amount of phosphate released was measured by reading the absorbance at 620 nm. The amount of protein used was predetermined and within the linear range of the reaction. The amount of phosphate released was normalized to the amount of protein used in the reaction. For measuring PTEN activity in vitro, 5 × 106 293T cells were transfected with 15 μg of expression plasmids using 9 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were solubilized in 600 μl of a lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Approximately 3 mg of total cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of an anti-AU5 antibody for 4 h, and immunocomplexes were affinity-absorbed onto 30 μl of GammaBind G-Sepharose beads. PTEN phosphatase activity was then assayed as described above. Peptide Inhibition Assay—20 nm bacterial PTEN was incubated with 50 μm synthetic diC8-PI(3,4,5)P3 in soluble form, in the presence of increasing amounts of the Cp-23 (0.1, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, and 2 mm), Cp-23DE (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mm), and Cp-23DEr (0, 0.07, 0.2, 0.7, and 2 mm) peptides for 10 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 25 μl. The phosphatase reaction was carried out as described above. The peptide sequences were as follows: Cp-23, DVSDNEPDHYRYSDTTDSDPENE; Cp-23DE, DVDDNEPDHYRYDDEEDDDPENE; Cp-23DEr, EDHNDPDVDRDDYYDEENEDEPD. In Vitro Binding—The expression plasmids (2 μg) were in vitro translated with 2 μl of [35S]methionine/cysteine (10 mCi/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) and 90 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The C-tail was expressed in bacteria, purified on a nickel-agarose column (Qiagen) to a final concentration of 3 μg of protein/30 μl of beads. The binding reaction was performed using 45 μl of the in vitro translation reaction and 3 μg of the C-tail in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer composed of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The binding reaction was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with the binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed on a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). Subcellular Distribution of PTEN in Cultured Cells—To gain insights into the distribution of PTEN in different cellular compartments, the subcellular distribution of endogenous PTEN was investigated in three nontransformed cell lines, NIH3T3, MCF10A, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Solubilizing cells with a hypotonic buffer followed by Triton X-100 (1%) extraction resulted in the majority of PTEN proteins being found in the cytosolic fractions. The levels of PTEN in the membrane fractions were almost undetectable under these experimental conditions (Fig. 1A). As has been reported previously, the use of a weaker nonionic detergent, saponin (0.01%), increased the amount of PTEN in the membrane fraction to a detectable level in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1B) (34Nagata Y. Lan K.H. Zhou X. Tan M. Esteva F.J. Sahin A.A. Klos K.S. Li P. Monia B.P. Nguyen N.T. Hortobagyi G.N. Hung M.C. Yu D.

The potential of cross-contamination was monitored by using lactate dehydrogenase and R-Ras as the cytoplasmic and membrane marker, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, the levels of PTEN in the nuclei of these cell lines were substantially lower than in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, by sucrose gradient fractionation, PTEN was not detected in the caveolin-rich lipid raft fractions (Fig. 1D). All of these data were consistent with several previous reports showing the predominant cytosolic localization of PTEN in mammalian cells (34Nagata Y. Lan K.H. Zhou X. Tan M. Esteva F.J. Sahin A.A.

Involvement of Ser-380 and Ser-385 in PTEN Membrane Targeting Capacity—Phosphorylation events in the C-tail region have been implicated in PTEN membrane binding capacity (14Das S. Dixon J.E. Cho W.

However, the relative contribution of individual phosphorylation sites to membrane targeting in mammalian cells has not been clearly defined. For this, a panel of PTEN phosphorylation site mutants was constructed. They consisted of single site mutants S370A, S380A, T382A, T383A, and S385A; double site mutant S370A/S385A; and triple site mutant S380A/T382A/T383A. Using a PTEN null cell line, PC3, PTEN mutants were transiently transfected and subjected to subcellular fractionation using the saponin-containing lysis buffer as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. Among the single site mutants, both S380A and S385A displayed 4- and 3.5-fold greater proportion in the membrane fraction when compared with wild-type PTEN, respectively (Fig. 2A). The double site mutant, S370A/S385A, has the highest membrane targeting capacity, which was 5.5-fold greater than that of the wild-type protein. On the contrary, single site mutants S370A and T382A did not display differences from the wild-type protein. Finally, the T383A and the triple mutant only showed a 2-fold increase. To ascertain the role of phosphorylation at positions Ser-380 and Ser-385 in membrane recruitment, we constructed two phosphomimic mutants, S380E and S385E. Using the saponin-based fractionation procedures, the S380E mutant showed similar membrane distribution when compared with the S380A mutant. On the contrary, the S385E mutant has a significantly lower membrane binding capacity tha"

P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 are Rac GEFs connecting Gβγ and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling to Rac activation. Their complex architecture suggests their regulation by protein-protein interactions. Novel mechanisms of activation of Rho GTPases are associated with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase known as a central regulator of cell growth and proliferation. Recently, two independent multiprotein complexes containing mTOR have been described. mTORC1 links to the classical rapamycin-sensitive pathways relevant for protein synthesis; mTORC2 links to the activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal events via undefined mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 establish, through their tandem DEP domains, interactions with mTOR, suggesting their potential as effectors in the signaling of mTOR to Rac activation and cell migration. This possibility was consistent with the effect of dominant-negative constructs and short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of P-Rex1, which decreased mTOR-dependent leucine-induced activation of Rac and cell migration. Rapamycin, a widely used inhibitor of mTOR signaling, did not inhibit Rac activity and cell migration induced by leucine, indicating that P-Rex1, which we found associated to both mTOR complexes, is only active when in the mTORC2 complex. mTORC2 has been described as the catalytic complex that phosphorylates AKT/PKB at Ser-473 and elicits activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal reorganization.

The initial reports on the characterization of mTORC2 demonstrated the ability of this complex to activate Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal events and opened the possibility that mTORC2 would be responsible for cell movement in response to agonists activating mTOR pathways. Interestingly, a recent report indicated that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are participants of type I insulin-like growth factor-stimulated motility (15Liu L. Li F. Cardelli J.A. Martin K.A. Blenis J. Huang S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear if differential signals activate mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. Neither is known what effector systems are directly sensitive to mTORC2 activation. Although the participation of Rho guanine exchange factors in the activation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeletal dynamics elicited by mTORC2 is expected, their identity and mechanism of action remain to be revealed. Here we identified the Rac guanine exchange factors P-Rex1 and P-Rex2 as the putative catalytic components of mTORC2 critical for the activation of Rac and cell migration elicited by leucine through the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex 2. These results implicate that P-Rex family members link mTORC2 signaling to Rac activation and cell migration in response to the activation of the rapamycin-insensitive mTOR complex. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The DEP-DEP domains of P-Rex1 were used as a bait to screen a human brain cDNA library with the Matchmaker System III (Clontech) following both the manufacturer’s instructions and the ones indicated by Vazquez-Prado et al. (29Vazquez-Prado J. Basile J. Gutkind J.S. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 259-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Clones were obtained under high stringency conditions using media lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. The specificity of the interaction between the DEP-DEP P-Rex1 domain with the mTOR carboxyl-terminal domain was confirmed using the control bait and prey provided by the Matchmaker System III kit. Constructs and Antibodies—prk5-myc-Rictor, prk5-myc-Raptor, and prk5-HA-GβL were obtained from D. Sabatini (see Ref. 4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H.

The shRNA for P-Rex1 corresponds to RNA interference codex HP_187924 cloned into the pSM2 vector, which was generated based on the sequence of the hairpin TGCTGTTGACAGTGAGCGAGGACACACTGTGCTTCCAGATTAGTGAAGCCACAGATGTAATCTGGAAGCACAGTGTGTCCGTGCCTACTGCCTCGGA. mTOR shRNA was obtained from P. Amornphimoltham. Anti-P-Rex1 rat monoclonal antibodies were obtained from M. Hoshino (see Ref. 13Yoshizawa M. Kawauchi T. Sone M. Nishimura Y.V. Terao M. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4406-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293T cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and harvested after 48 h. When indicated cells were starved of leucine for 2 h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Specialty Media (Cell & Molecular Technologies) before stimulation. Cross-linking Assay and Immunoprecipitations—HEK 293T cells in 10-cm dishes were placed on ice, rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and either 1% Triton X-100 or 0.3% CHAPS, for immunoprecipitation of mTOR complexes) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). For cross-linking assays 2.5 mg/ml dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce) was added to the lysis buffer, and cells were rotated for 30 min on ice. Cross-linking reactions were quenched by adding 75 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) followed by an additional 30 min incubation at room temperature. After clearing, 1 μl of each antibody for immunoprecipitation was added to the supernatant and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C.25 μl of 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added and rotated again for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 1× protein sample buffer. The interaction between endogenous P-Rex1 and mTor was detected using lysates from HeLa cells processed as described for HEK 293T cells; in this case, mTor antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and PTEN antibody, also from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, was used as a control. and both were goat polyclonal antibodies; 10 μl of each antibody per 1 ml of lysate was used. Endogenous P-Rex1 was detected with Anti-P-Rex1 rat monoclonal antibodies obtained from M. Hoshino (see Ref. 13Yoshizawa M. Kawauchi T. Sone M. Nishimura Y.V. Terao M. Chihama K. Nabeshima Y. Hoshino M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4406-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), and the following antibodies were used for the immunoblots: mouse monoclonal antibodies against Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories), GFP (Covance), FLAG (Sigma), HA (Covance), Myc (Covance), rabbit monoclonal antibodies against mTOR (Cell Signaling), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein Ser-240/244 (Cell Signaling), S6 ribosomal protein (Cell Signaling), and GST (prepared in the laboratory). Rac-GTP Assays—HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids and shRNAs; 48 h later, cells were starved and stimulated as described above. When indicated, cells were incubated with rapamycin (Calbiochem) for 30 min before the assay. Cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were cleared, and aliquots were saved to check for total protein expression. 50 μl of GST-PAK CRIB beads were added and rotated for 45 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of protein sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto a 12% gel. Migration Assays—Serum-free media containing either l-leucine or 10% FBS, which was used as a positive control, was placed in the bottom wells of a Boyden chamber; media containing HeLa cells, starved for 2 h in serum-free media lacking leucine, were added to the top chamber. The two chambers were separated by a polycarbonate filter membrane (Neuro Probe, 8 μm-pore), coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Calbiochem). After a 6-h incubation, membranes were stained with crystal violet, placed on a glass slide, and scanned. Densitometric quantitation was performed with ImageJ software. Where indicated cells were previously transfected with plasmids and shRNAs and starved for 2 h before this assay as described above. For the rapamycin assay, cells were starved for 2 h and preincubated with rapamycin for 30 min. Rapamycin was also added to the cell suspension placed on the top chamber wells and also to the chemoattractant added to the bottom chamber wells in order to be present during the migration time. In Vitro Translation and in Vitro Interactions—All in vitro translation reactions were carried out using the Expressway cell-free Escherichia coli expression system (catalog number K9901-00, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, for each reaction we mixed in an Eppendorf tube, the E. coli SlyD-Extract, 2.5× in vitro protein synthesis E. coli Reaction Buffer (-amino acids), 50 mm amino acids (-Met), 75 mm methionine, T7 Enzyme Mix. 3XFLAG-mTor prey cloned into pEF1/His (Invitrogen) was used as DNA template containing the T7 promoter. The reactions were incubated in a shaker at 3000 rpm at 37 °C for 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, 50 μl of Feed Buffer (2× IVPS Feed Buffer, 50 mm amino acids (-Met), 75 mm methionine) was added, followed by an additional incubation for 6 h. The reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 containing protease inhibitors). In vitro translated FLAG-mTor prey was incubated overnight with glutathione beads containing either P-Rex1 carboxyl-terminal domain or P-Rex1 DEP-DEP domains, both expressed as GST fusion proteins isolated from transfected HEK 293T cells. Before incubation with in vitro translated mTor prey, beads were washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl. The isolated complexes were denatured in SDS sample buffer under reducing conditions, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon membranes for Western blotting using FLAG and GST antibodies. mTOR Interacts with P-Rex1 in Yeast and Mammalian Cells—In order to identify proteins that may regulate P-Rex1, we used the tandem DEP domains of P-Rex1 (Fig. 1A) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen using a human brain cDNA library. We found that in yeast P-Rex1 DEP-DEP interacted with the carboxyl-terminal region, including the kinase domain, of mTOR; this interaction was specific as indicated by the growth, in restrictive media lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, of yeast transformed just with the combination of P-Rex DEP-DEP and mTOR prey or the positive control of the system composed of p53 and T antigen (Fig. 1, A and B). To assess in mammalian cells the interaction of P-Rex1 with mTOR, the region of P-Rex1 comprising the two tandem DEP domains and the carboxyl-terminal region of mTOR (corresponding to the prey from the yeast two hybrid) were transfected into the human epithelial cell line HEK293T as GST fusion and 3XFLAG-tagged proteins, respectively. The corresponding cell extracts were incubated with glutathione Sepharose beads. The carboxyl-terminal region of mTOR (mTOR prey) was detected associated with P-Rex1-DEP-DEP fused to GST but not with GST used as control (Fig. 1C). Endogenous mTOR also interacted with P-Rex1 DEP-DEP expressed as a GST fusion protein (Fig. 1D). To further analyze this interaction, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the mTOR prey fused to GST and GFP-tagged P-Rex1 DEP-DEP domains (Fig. 1E) or HA-tagged mTOR prey and 3XFLAG-tagged P-Rex1 (Fig. 1F). In either case, both the bait (P-Rex1-DEP-DEP) and full-length P-Rex1 specifically interacted with mTOR prey (Fig. 1, E-F). To demonstrate a direct interaction between P-Rex1 and mTOR, an in vitro interaction assay was conducted using in vitro translated FLAG-tagged mTOR prey and recombinant P-Rex1 DEP-DEP domains or P-Rex1 carboxyl-terminal domain (used as control), both expressed as GST fusion proteins. P-Rex1 domains were affinity-purified and washed with 0.5 m NaCl before the interaction assay. mTOR prey was detected associated with P-Rex1 DEP-DEP (Fig. 1G). The interaction of both endogenous proteins was also assessed by immunoprecipitating mTOR, and detecting P-Rex1, a control lysate from cells in which P-Rex1 was knocked down, was included in the Western blot to further support the identification of the band corresponding to endogenous P-Rex1 (Fig. 2). We next wished to evaluate the possible interaction between mTOR and other members of the P-Rex family. HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with GST-tagged mTOR prey and GFP-tagged P-Rex1, P-Rex2a, or P-Rex2b (Fig. 3). The GST pulldown assays proved that mTOR not only interacts with P-Rex1 but also with P-Rex2a and P-Rex2b. No interaction was observed with the Rho GEF PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG) used as control (Fig. 3). These results, together with the two-hybrid screen, demonstrate that P-Rex family of Rac GEFs, including P-Rex1, P-Rex2a, and P-Rex2b, are able to interact directly with mTOR, opening the possibility that this group of GEFs could participate in the activation of Rac and cytoskeletal events downstream of mTORC2.FIGURE 2Interaction of endogenous mTOR with P-Rex1. The interaction between endogenous mTor and P-REX1 was assessed by immunoprecipitation (IP) using lysates from HeLa cells. A control lysate from cells in which P-Rex1 was knocked down was included in the Western blot (WB) to further support the immunodetection of the band corresponding to endogenous P-Rex1. A goat antibody was used as a negative control. Endogenous mTOR was immunoprecipitated, and endogenous P-Rex1 was found associated with it. Total lysates (TCL, left and middle panels) and immunoprecipitation (IP, right) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3mTOR interacts with all the different P-Rex family members. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with GST-mTOR prey and GFP-tagged P-Rex1, P-Rex2a, and P-Rex2b. Pulldown assays were performed. Total cell lysates (TCL) and pulldowns were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting. Interactions of mTOR prey with the three P-Rex family members were found.

Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar, 6Jacinto E.

Thus, we wanted to determine whether the interaction of mTOR with P-Rex1 could be involved in the recently described ability of mTORC2 to promote the activation of Rac. Since amino acids activate mTOR, we decided to use l-leucine as a model to evaluate the role of this protein in Rac activation and cell migration. First, we evaluated whether mTOR stimulation by leucine would promote the formation of active, GTP-bound, Rac in HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). The amount of GTP-bound Rac increased with the addition of leucine after 1 min of stimulation and remained elevated for 10 min. These results correlated with the activation of S6K, a very well characterized mTOR effector, determined by an increase in the phosphorylation of its substrate, S6, in response to leucine, in samples from the same cell lysates. TIAM, a well characterized Rac GEF, used as positive control, was able to induce activation of Rac and promote the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6. Next, considering that knocking down mTOR with specific short interfering RNA has been reported to decrease basal Rac-GTP in NIH 3T3 cells (6Jacinto E. Loewith R. Schmidt A. Lin S. Ruegg M.A. Hall A. Hall M.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar), we evaluated the participation of mTOR in leucine-induced Rac activation; mTOR shRNA was transfected, and the amount of GTP-bound Rac was measured after leucine stimulation (Fig. 4B). The ability of leucine to induce the activation of Rac was dramatically decreased in cells transfected with mTOR shRNA; as expected, the phosphorylation of S6, induced by leucine, was also prevented in cells in which mTOR was knocked down (Fig. 4B). These results correlated with the important decrease of mTOR detected by Western blot (Fig. 4B). To investigate the participation of P-Rex1 in the ability of mTORC2 to promote Rac activation in response to leucine, two independent approaches were used. First, a dominant-negative P-Rex1 (ΔDH-P-Rex1) was transfected, and the amount of GTP-bound Rac was measured after leucine stimulation (Fig. 4C). Second, P-Rex1 shRNA was used to knock down the expression of endogenous P-Rex1 (Fig. 4D). The activation of Rac induced by leucine was significantly decreased by both complementary approaches (Fig. 4, C and D). These results indicated a relevant participation of this GEF in the signaling pathway from mTOR to Rac. It is well known that branched chain amino acids such as leucine regulate the mTORC1 complex by activation of mTOR and further phosphorylation of the S6 protein (27Kim D.H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M.

Vary T.C. Wallin R. Damuni Z. Hutson S.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-E863): E854Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In these experiments we wished to address the state of phosphorylation of the S6 after leucine stimulation in nontransfected cells (Fig. 4A) and in cells transfected with the mTOR shRNA (Fig. 4B), the dominant-negative P-Rex1 (Fig. 4C), and the shRNA to P-Rex1 (Fig. 4D). The results show a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of S6 only in the cells transfected with mTOR shRNA (Fig. 4B) as opposed to the cells transfected with either the dominant-negative P-Rex1 or the P-Rex1 shRNA, in which the phosphorylation of S6 increased with the addition of leucine to the media. Together, these results indicate that S6 phosphorylation is independent of P-Rex1, supporting the hypothesis that P-Rex1 is active as a component of mTORC2 and inactive when associated to mTORC1. A GST pulldown assay was performed to further analyze the role of the DEP-DEP domains of P-Rex1 with respect to mTOR interaction. As seen in Fig. 4E, the interaction of both proteins (P-Rex1 and mTOR prey) was dramatically weakened by the expression of the DEP domains of P-Rex1, which compete with the endogenous domains of this protein. In addition, P-Rex1 DEP domains inhibit the activation of Rac induced by leucine (Fig. 4F), and this result is coincident with the reduced effect of Rac activation seen with the dominant-negative P-Rex1 (Fig. 4C). P-Rex1 Is Part of Both mTOR Complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2—Since mTOR has been found in two different multiprotein complexes (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R.

In order to assess this possibility, we explored the presence of P-Rex1 in isolated mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) or complex 2 (mTORC2). HEK 293T cells were transfected with 3XFLAG-tagged P-Rex1, HA-tagged GβL/mLST8, and either Myc-tagged Raptor or Myc-tagged Rictor; mTORC1 and mTORC2 were isolated by immunoprecipitation of Raptor and Rictor, respectively (Fig. 5A). Unexpectedly, P-Rex1 was found associated with both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Fig. 5A), and it did not interact with an unrelated Myc-tagged protein (associate molecule with the Src homology 3 domain of STAM) that was used as a negative control (Fig. 5B). mTOR Induces Cell Migration via P-Rex1—Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by mTORC2 has been described (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar, 6Jacinto E.

Moreover, recent findings in Dictyostelium show the involvement of the TORC2 complex in chemotaxis and cell polarity (33Lee S. Comer F.I. Sasaki A. McLeod I.X. Duong Y. Okumura K. Yates J.R. II I Parent C.A. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4572-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). So far, we have demonstrated that leucine activates Rac via mTOR and P-Rex1-dependent pathways; therefore, we wished to determine whether leucine could also induce cell migration dependent on P-Rex1. The ability of HeLa cells to migrate in the presence of leucine was demonstrated (supplemental Fig. 1). Then a migration assay was performed using HeLa cells transfected with the dominant-negative P-Rex1 or the shRNA to P-Rex1, and cells transfected with empty shRNA vector (pENTR) were also used as a control. Cells were either non-stimulated or stimulated with leucine or fetal bovine serum as a positive control and left to migrate for 6 h at 37 °C. The results show a remarkable increase in the number of migrating cells when stimulated with leucine or serum in control cells. On the contrary, cells transfected with either dominant-negative P-Rex1 or P-Rex1 shRNA showed a dramatic decrease in the number of migrating cells only when stimulated with leucine (Fig. 6, A and B). As expected, cells in which mTOR was knocked down with specific shRNA were unable to migrate in response to a leucine gradient (Fig. 6B). A transfection efficiency of at least 50% (monitored with GFP) was accomplished for these experiments. To discern if mTORC1 is relevant for the chemokinetic activity induced by leucine, we evaluated the migration of HeLa cells incubated with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1; the results, shown in Fig. 6C, indicated that only serum-induced migration of HeLa cells was only slightly decreased in presence of a high dose of rapamycin, whereas the one induced by leucine was not affected by it. A Rac activation assay was also carried out; the results (Fig. 6D) showed no decrease in Rac activity after leucine stimulation in cells treated with rapamycin compared with control cells. Overall, these results demonstrate that leucine induces cell migration and Rac activation in a P-Rex1-dependent manner involving the participation of the mTORC2 complex. Our findings provide a novel mechanism by which mTORC2 can control the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of Rho GTPases (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R.

Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5176) Google Scholar). Based on our results, we can postulate that by virtue of its ability to form molecular complexes with mTOR, P-Rex1 can link mTORC2 activation to the stimulation of Rac signaling, leading to the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. This molecular pathway involves proteins that have previously been identified as part of the mTORC2 complex, mLST8 and Rictor (4Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R.

Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5176) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6E). Our data show that both P-Rex1 and mTOR are needed for Rac activation and cell migration induced by leucine, and whether they are part of the same signaling route or acting through independent pathways remains to be elucidated. However, as P-Rex1 is also a constituent of mTORC1, it may also participate in mTORC1-initiated Rac activation, as recently observed in cell migration in response to insulin-like growth factor (15Liu L. Li F. Cardelli J.A. Martin K.A. Blenis J. Huang S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar); or alternatively, P-Rex1 may be a component of oligomeric complexes containing both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (16Wullschleger S.

The fact that TIAM was able to activate both Rac and the ribosomal protein S6 drew our attention. These results are coincident with demonstrated ability of Rac to promote the activation of p70 S6K (30Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and the ability of this Rac GEF, in a complex with spinophilin, to contribute to the activation of p70 S6K (31Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18833-18841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative P-Rex1 and the shRNA to P-Rex1 had no effect on pS6 levels; this could be due to P-Rex1 participating only in Rac activation processes (15Liu L. Li F. Cardelli J.A. Martin K.A. Blenis J. Huang S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7029-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) even when it is also associated to complex 1 of mTOR. Eukaryotic cells rely on the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton and chemotaxis to find nutrients in order to survive starvation conditions; the participation of TOR signaling in these events has been recognized in yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum (18Schmidt A. Kunz J. Hall M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13780-13785Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 19Lee S. Comer F.I. Sasaki A. McLeod I.X. Duong Y. Okumura K. Yates J.R. II I Parent C.A. Firtel R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 4572-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In yeast, ROM2 is the RhoGEF acting downstream of TOR2 in the pathway leading to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (20Schmidt A. Bickle M. Beck T. Hall M.N. Cell. 1997; 88: 531-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ROM2 contains a DEP domain as part of its structure; thus the finding that P-Rex1 uses its DEP domains to interact with mTOR suggests that P-Rex1 and its homologs might represent the mammalian orthologs of ROM2. Indeed, our findings showing that HeLa cells can migrate in the presence of leucine, and the central role of P-Rex1 in this process, may reflect the existence of a mammalian counterpart of this ancestral survival mechanism. Furthermore, the identification of P-Rex1 as a participant in the signaling route by which mTOR controls Rac activation and cell migration may also provide a novel therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention in many pathological conditions that are characterized by the overactivity of mTOR, including human cancer (21Sabatini D.M.

https://openalex.org/W2002480100,"Recent observations point to the role played by Zn2+ as an inducer of neuronal death. Two Zn2+ targets have been identified that result in inhibition of mitochondrial respiration: the bc1 center and, more recently, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Zn2+ is also a mediator of oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial failure, release of apoptotic peptides, and neuronal death. We now present evidence, by means of direct biochemical assays, that Zn2+ is imported through the Ca2+ uniporter and directly targets major enzymes of energy production (lipoamide dehydrogenase) and antioxidant defense (thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase). We demonstrate the following. (a) These matrix enzymes are rapidly inhibited by application of Zn2+ to intact mitochondria. (b) Delayed treatment with membrane-impermeable chelators has no effect, indicating rapid transport of biologically relevant quantities of Zn2+ into the matrix. (c) Membrane-permeable chelators stop but do not reverse enzyme inactivation. (d) Enzyme inhibition is rapid and irreversible and precedes the major changes associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). (e) The extent and rate of enzyme inactivation linearly correlates with the MPT onset and propagation. (f) The Ca2+ uniporter blocker, Ruthenium Red, protects enzyme activities and delays pore opening up to 2 μm Zn2+. An additional, unidentified import route functions at higher Zn2+ concentrations. (g) No enzyme inactivation is observed for Ca2+-induced MPT. These observations strongly suggest that, unlike Ca2+, exogenous Zn2+ interferes with mitochondrial NADH production and directly alters redox protection in the matrix, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction. Inactivation of these enzymes by Zn2+ is irreversible, and thus only their de novo synthesis can restore function, which may underlie persistent loss of oxidative carbohydrate metabolism following transient ischemia. Recent observations point to the role played by Zn2+ as an inducer of neuronal death. Two Zn2+ targets have been identified that result in inhibition of mitochondrial respiration: the bc1 center and, more recently, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Zn2+ is also a mediator of oxidative stress, leading to mitochondrial failure, release of apoptotic peptides, and neuronal death. We now present evidence, by means of direct biochemical assays, that Zn2+ is imported through the Ca2+ uniporter and directly targets major enzymes of energy production (lipoamide dehydrogenase) and antioxidant defense (thioredoxin reductase and glutathione reductase). We demonstrate the following. (a) These matrix enzymes are rapidly inhibited by application of Zn2+ to intact mitochondria. (b) Delayed treatment with membrane-impermeable chelators has no effect, indicating rapid transport of biologically relevant quantities of Zn2+ into the matrix. (c) Membrane-permeable chelators stop but do not reverse enzyme inactivation. (d) Enzyme inhibition is rapid and irreversible and precedes the major changes associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). (e) The extent and rate of enzyme inactivation linearly correlates with the MPT onset and propagation. (f) The Ca2+ uniporter blocker, Ruthenium Red, protects enzyme activities and delays pore opening up to 2 μm Zn2+. An additional, unidentified import route functions at higher Zn2+ concentrations. (g) No enzyme inactivation is observed for Ca2+-induced MPT. These observations strongly suggest that, unlike Ca2+, exogenous Zn2+ interferes with mitochondrial NADH production and directly alters redox protection in the matrix, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction. Inactivation of these enzymes by Zn2+ is irreversible, and thus only their de novo synthesis can restore function, which may underlie persistent loss of oxidative carbohydrate metabolism following transient ischemia. Recently a growing number of reports have linked changes in intracellular free Zn2+ to pathological processes, particularly in the nervous system (1Dineley K.E. Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Elevated Zn2+ has been implicated in neuronal death following ischemia (2Koh J.Y. Suh S.W. Gwag B.J. He Y.Y. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. Science. 1996; 272: 1013-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) and excitotoxicity (3Frederickson C.J. Maret W. Cuajungco M.P. Neuroscientist. 2004; 10: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The role of Zn2+ in Alzheimer disease has been controversial (4Cuajungco M.P. Faget K.Y. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2003; 41: 44-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), although a recent study strongly associates elevated cortical Zn2+ with Alzheimer disease diagnosis and severity of dementia (5Religa D. Strozyk D. Cherny R.A. Volitakis I. Haroutunian V. Winblad B. Naslund J. Bush A.I. Neurology. 2006; 67: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). One mechanistic theme that has emerged is that elevated intracellular Zn2+ is correlated with mitochondrial dysfunction, loss of mitochondrial defenses, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (1Dineley K.E.

Although Ca2+ is a recognized physiological inducer of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) 2The abbreviations used are: MPT, mitochondrial permeability transition; DTNB, dithio-nitrobenzoic acid; GR, glutathione reductase; TR, thioredoxin reductase; GR + TR, combined glutathione and thioredoxin reductases; LA, lipoamide; LADH, LA dehydrogenase; TPEN, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine. pore, the role of Zn2+ in mitochondria dysfunction is a newly arising question. Zn2+ is a much more potent inducer of MPT than Ca2+ (i.e. it works at doses at least an order of magnitude lower than those needed for Ca2+ (9Bossy-Wetzel E. Talantova M.V. Lee W.D. Scholzke M.N.

Early publications demonstrated Zn2+ inhibition of mitochondrial respiration (12Skulachev V.P. Christyakov V.V. Jasaitis A.A. Smirnova E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1967; 26: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), which was attributed to the cytochrome bc1 center (13Link T.A. von Jagow G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that Zn2+ inhibits mitochondrial matrix multienzyme complexes (15Brown A.M. Kristal B.S. Effron M.S. Shestopalov A.I. Ullucci P.A. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Cooper A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Gazaryan I.G.

Other targets have been identified (11Jiang D. Sullivan P.G. Sensi S.L. Steward O. Weiss J.H. J. Biol.

Mitochondrion (Kidlington). 2005; 5: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), including pore-forming proteins in the outer membrane (18Bonanni L. Chachar M. Jover-Mengual T. Li H. Jones A.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6851-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). There is also evidence for Zn2+ import through the calcium uniporter (11Jiang D. Sullivan P.G. Sensi S.L. Steward O.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Elucidation of plausible targets for Zn2+ is complicated by the fact that the mechanistic details underlying the classical phenomenon of Ca2+-induced MPT itself are unclear. The composition of the pore complex is still disputed (21Halestrap A.P. McStay G.P. Clarke S.J. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 22Verrier F. Mignotte B. Jan G. Brenner C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 1010: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this work, we addressed the question of Zn2+ targets in MPT using a quantitative approach that is well established for the study of enzyme mechanism. We employed analysis of the combined effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on the time course of mitochondrial swelling, whereas varying the concentrations of both metals. This “enzyme kinetics” approach has been complemented by the direct assay of enzymatic activities of flavin-dependent thiol reductases in the mitochondrial matrix during the course of metal-induced swelling. Kinetic analysis provides evidence for both independent and competing sites of action for Ca2+ and Zn2+ that contribute to MPT induction. We also present direct evidence for the impairment of these major enzymes of energy production and antioxidant defense in mitochondrial matrix in the course of Zn2+-induced pore opening, which is distinct from the mechanism of Ca2+-induced pore opening. Reagents—NADH, NADPH, α-lipoamide (dl-6, 8-thioctic acid amide), oxidized glutathione, dithio-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB), recombinant Escherichia coli thioredoxin, Tris, HEPES, ZnCl2, EDTA, N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine (TPEN), Ruthenium Red, alamethicin, succinic acid, rotenone, glutamic acid, malic acid, isocitric acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, and KOH were from Sigma. All reagents were “SigmaUltra” grade, if available, to reduce the possibility of contamination by divalent cations. Me2SO was from Fisher Scientific, and HCl was from J. T. Baker, Inc. All solutions were prepared using distilled, deionized water with >16 megao-hms/cm of resistance. NADPH and NADH were freshly prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in water. Oxidized glutathione and DTNB were freshly prepared as 30 and 60 mm stock solutions in water and ethanol, respectively. Lipoamide (LA) was dissolved in Me2SO (25 mm) and was used to make 0.2-2 mm LA solutions in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. ZnCl2 was made as a 10 mm stock solution in water. Mitochondria Preparation and MPT Studies—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described earlier (23Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial suspensions (50-60 mg of protein/ml) were kept on ice for no longer than 6 h prior to MPT and/or enzymatic activity measurements. MPT experiments were performed with 2 mg/ml mitochondria suspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.4, and 5 mm potassium succinate as a respiration substrate, unless otherwise stated. 100-μl aliquots were placed into a microplate, and the changes in absorbance at 540 nm were recorded using a plate reader, as described below. The temperature was maintained at 26 °C. Concentrations of Ca2+ and Zn2+ were varied within the range of 1-64 and 0.3-9 μm, respectively. Enzyme activities were measured in parallel with absorbance monitoring. At varied intervals, aliquots were removed, and enzyme activities were measured as described below. In experiments with TPEN and EDTA chase, mitochondria were loaded with Zn2+, and then 1-ml aliquots were transferred into wells containing EDTA or TPEN after 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-min incubations. In experiments with Ruthenium Red, it was added to mitochondria simultaneously with Zn2+ loading. Enzymatic Assays—All enzymatic assays were performed in a 96-well plate reader (SpectraMax Plus, GE Healthcare) with a 200-μl reaction mixture per well at 20 °C. The absorbance of DTNB (ɛ412 = 13.6 mm-1 cm-1 (24Zhong L. Arner E.S. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)) was monitored. The light path was 0.43 cm. All reactions were run in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA and either 0.1 mg/ml alamethicin or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 to permeabilize mitochondria. (No difference in recovered activity was observed between alamethicin and Nonidet P-40 treatments.) GR + TR activity was measured with 0.2 mm NADPH, 2 mm DTNB, and 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione. LADH activity was measured in a mixture containing 0.2 mm NADH, 2 mm DTNB, and 0.1 mm lipoamide. Reactions were initiated by the addition of mitochondrial aliquots (10 μl for LADH activity and 50 μl for TR + GR activity) to the reaction buffers. Preincubation with EDTA in the presence of alamethicin did not result in higher activity. We note that DTNB-based detection has a significant advantage over monitoring disappearance of NAD(P)H at 340 nm because it provides a 4-fold increase in the absorbance change per unit reaction. In addition, we observed that the use of DTNB as a terminal electron acceptor rescues LADH from product inhibition, i.e. removes reduced lipoamide from the reaction mixture. Discrimination between the enzymes took advantage of differences in catalytic properties of the enzymes, i.e. the absence of LADH activity with NADPH, with DTNB alone; the absence of TR and GR activity with NADH; and reduced GR activity in the absence of oxidized glutathione. In all cases, a linear slope was observed for a minimum of 20 min. Description of Microplate-based Ca2+ and Zn2+ Swelling Titrations—The MPT is commonly monitored as changes in light scattering, which is especially pronounced for liver mitochondria. It is well established that changes in mitochondrial light scattering correspond to matrix swelling associated with pore opening (25Beavis A.D. Brannan R.D. Garlid K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13424-13433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Swelling can conveniently be recorded spectrophotometrically as a decrease in the apparent absorbance at 540 nm (i.e. increased transmittance). Our laboratory introduced the use of a microtiter plate reader to collect experimental data on mitochondria swelling (23Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 26Stavrovskaya I.G. Narayanan M.V. Zhang W. Krasnikov B.F. Heemskerk J. Young S.S. Blass J.P. Brown A.M. Beal M.F. Friedlander R.M. Kristal B.S. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 200: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The advantage of this approach is that it allows many different experimental conditions to be monitored simultaneously and directly compared. Henceforth, we will refer to absorbance changes as the primary output signal corresponding to MPT-associated mitochondrial swelling. An example of a two-dimensional titration is shown in Fig. 1A, where two different MPT effectors are titrated simultaneously. In Fig. 1A, the far left column presents the titration against increasing concentrations of Ca2+ in the absence of added Zn2+, whereas the other columns contain different fixed concentrations of Zn2+. Conversely, the highlighted row presents the titration against Zn2+ in the absence of Ca2+, whereas the other rows contain either EDTA or a different fixed concentration of Ca2+. This experimental format allows simultaneous generation of a complete set of titration data for two effectors. Quantitative relationships between these effectors can therefore be determined from analysis of a single experimental run, eliminating the confounding effects of variations in reagent concentration or aging of the mitochondria. The data presented in Fig. 1B (Zn2+ only) and Fig. 1C (Ca2+ only) appear superficially similar and might lead one to conclude (erroneously) that Zn2+ and Ca2+ are qualitatively similar, except that Zn2+ is ∼20-fold more potent Ca2+. It is true that increasing concentrations of either Ca2+ or Zn2+ accelerate pore opening by shortening the lag period, and both agents increase the maximum rate of swelling. However, this first impression is incomplete, as we will show below. Kinetic Model of Swelling Curves—The sigmoidal shape of the swelling time course is characterized by the lag period and maximum slope (Fig. 1, inset). The swelling time course resembles the shape of a sigmoid (Fig. 1, inset), particularly for faster transitions. The simplest reaction model (27Dedov V.N. Demin O.V. Chernyak V.Y. Chernyak B.V. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 809-816PubMed Google Scholar) for sigmoidal kinetics is a series of two consecutive steps for mitochondria transformation via at least one intermediate, which has the same absorbance characteristics as the original state. In this model, only the final state manifests itself by the changes in absorbance. This reaction model is described in Scheme 1. The first step corresponds to the binding or uptake of Ca2+ by mitochondria, presumably by the Ca2+ uniporter, and may be reversible. The second step corresponds to the rate-limiting step in the unknown intermediate transformation(s) that eventually lead(s) to pore opening. Similarly, a recent study proposes that MPT is at least a two-step mechanism culminating in pore opening (28Ricchelli F. Jori G. Gobbo S. Nikolov P. Petronilli V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The effector (e.g. Ca2+ or Zn2+) may alter any or all of these characteristics by influencing different steps in the transformation chain presented in Scheme 1. The lag period may correspond principally to a “pore-forming event” (28Ricchelli F. Jori G. Gobbo S. Nikolov P. Petronilli V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 1858-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or a “cristae remodeling event” (29Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In contrast, the maximum rate of swelling will reflect contributions from both the processes leading to the initial pore-opening event and the propagation of pore opening through the mitochondrial population. This is because pore opening results in Ca2+ release, which increases the concentration of effector in the first step of Scheme 1. Large-amplitude swelling is a consequence of the pore-opening event that is conjectured to be “all-or-none” in nature (30Massari S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31942-31948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. the pore is either open or closed. Once the pore opens, the released calcium is consumed by the remaining coupled mitochondria, leading to progressively greater Ca2+ overload to the coupled fraction of mitochondria. Moreover, swollen mitochondria are known to release more calcium than was added initially, further contributing to the overall Ca2+ load. In the terminology of chemical kinetics, the Ca2+-induced swelling reaction is autocatalytic or product-catalyzed. No analytical solution exists for the complete system of equations describing autocatalytic reactions in chemical kinetics. Nevertheless, kinetic analysis can be applied to separate the “events” represented by different characteristics of the swelling curves. Analysis of Maximum Rates of Swelling, Mixed Competition of Zn2+ and Ca2+ Sites in MPT—The maximum rate of swelling, measured as the maximal rate of change of mitochondrial absorbance, has been recognized as an integral characteristic of the process and analyzed in double-reciprocal plots (31Bernardi P. Vassanelli S. Veronese P. Colonna R. Szabo I. Zoratti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2934-2939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach is based on the assumption that the maximum rate corresponds to the establishment of a pseudo-steady state where the concentration of Mintermediate reaches the maximum, and for a short time period, its concentration can be considered constant. During this interval, the maximum rate corresponds to the maximum concentration of Mintermediate multiplied by the rate constant for its final conversion (k2). In the most general case, the maximum concentration of Mintermediate will be a function of both rate constants (formation and consumption) in Scheme 1. Therefore, if an inducer (such as Zn2+) influences both rate constants, the maximum rate may be a complex function of the inducer concentration. Nevertheless, double reciprocal treatment may point to the relationships between two co-varied inducers. Fig. 2 presents double-reciprocal plots for the maximum rate of swelling. The plots indicate that both Zn2+ and Ca2+ influence the maximum rate (intercept on the y axis) and apparent “binding constant” (intercept on the x axis) for the site(s) that regulate the swelling process. Stated in other words, the two metals compete in stimulating the swelling process but do not fully substitute for each other. The activation constants for the competitive Zn2+ and Ca2+ site, determined from the intersection points, are equal to 0.25 and 5 μm, respectively. This corresponds to the 20-fold more potent effect of Zn2+ when compared with Ca2+ in MPT induction seen by inspection of Fig. 1, B and C. It is well established that MPT induction involves the Ca2+ uniporter (32Kroner H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 251: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Crompton M. Andreeva L. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As we will show later, Zn2+ also enters the mitochondrial matrix through the Ca2+ uniporter. The possible identity of the competitive Zn2+ and Ca2+ site will be commented on in the “Discussion.” Analysis of Swelling at Saturating Concentrations, Identification of Kinetically Independent Zn2+ and Ca2+ Sites—An enzyme kinetics approach that can help to untangle the relationship between two activators or inhibitors is to study the effect of varying one in the presence of the saturating concentration of the other. If the effectors (i.e. Ca2+ and Zn2+) compete for a single “physical site” (which in the case of MPT may be the Ca2+ uniporter, a component of the permeability pore, or an unknown matrix enzyme/protein), this site can be completely occupied by saturating concentrations of either metal. No effect will be observed upon the addition of the second effector if the concentration of the first one was saturating. In contrast, if the effector sites are independent, the addition of the second effector at the saturating concentration of the first one will still result in a pronounced change on the time course curve. In the case of MPT, the concentration of the effector is considered saturating if its subsequent addition causes no major changes in the time course of swelling. In the case of Ca2+, the saturated concentration range starts at ∼30 μm, whereas for Zn2+, it is above 3 μm. The existence of two distinct sites in MPT for Ca2+ and Zn2+ was visualized by the following approach. Varying Zn2+ in the presence of saturating Ca2+ (Fig. 3A) results in lag period shortening with the maximum slope lines that are nearly parallel. In contrast, varying Ca2+ in the presence of saturating Zn2+ (Fig. 3B) results in the increase of the maximum slope with no changes in the lag period duration (see the slope lines intersecting at the same time point). This qualitative difference in the concentration-dependent behavior is evidence for the presence of distinct, kinetically independent effector sites Ca2+ and Zn2+ in MPT. We interpret this qualitative difference in the following manner. Zn2+ speeds up step(s) that precede large-amplitude swelling with a resulting shortening of the lag period. On the other hand, Ca2+ speeds up propagation of the pore-opening event through the mitochondrial population, resulting in a faster swelling rate. Irreversible Inactivation of LADH and GR + TR Pools in Zn2+, but not Ca2+, MPT—An important goal for understanding the nature of the Zn2+-induced shortening of lag is the identification of molecular targets that are altered by Zn2+.We have previously observed that LADH is a target of Zn2+ (16Gazaryan I.G. Krasnikov B.F. Ashby G.A. Thorneley R.N. Kristal B.S. Brown A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10064-10072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), an NADH-dependent thiol reductase. Therefore, we investigated the impact of Zn2+ treatment upon NAD(P)H-dependent thiol reductase enzyme activities inside mitochondria, whereas simultaneously monitoring the time course of MPT pore opening. We monitored the activity changes of mitochondrial LADH and GR + TR activities in the course of Zn2+- and Ca2+-induced MPT. This was accomplished by exposing coupled mitochondria to Ca2+ or Zn2+ and then assaying residual enzyme activities at different times after the addition of effector. Rapid assay of these matrix enzymes was accomplished by adding mitochondrial aliquots directly to assay mixtures that included detergent or ala-methicin, a pore-forming antibiotic peptide, to rapidly expose the matrix contents to enzyme substrates. The assay mixture also included a large excess of EDTA (0.5 mm) to chelate all free Zn2+ or Ca2+ and prevent inhibition by Zn2+ or Ca2+ that had not entered into the mitochondria prior to lysis. Because this procedure also relieved any reversible metal-dependent enzyme inhibition, the changes detected represent irreversible enzyme inactivation. Previous studies demonstrated that reversal of Zn2+ inhibition of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex is gradual, as demonstrated by upward curvature of the reaction curves (15Brown A.M. Kristal B.S. Effron M.S. Shestopalov A.I. Ullucci P.A. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Cooper A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Delayed recovery of activity has been avoided in the current experiments by the use of higher EDTA concentrations (0.5 mm versus 10 μm). The resulting activity measurements show no curvature (see “Experimental Procedures”), in contrast to our previous observations. Inactivation of LADH (Fig. 4A) and GR + TR (Fig. 4B) occurs largely prior to pore opening (Fig. 4C) and is proportional to Zn2+ concentration. No consistent drop in these enzyme activities was observed (Fig. 4D) upon the addition of sufficient Ca2+ to induce MPT in a similar time scale. Furthermore, inactivation of these enzymes requires that Zn2+ treatment be applied to intact, coupled mitochondria. Fig. 4E illustrates that even high doses of Zn2+ applied to permeabilized mitochondria result in only modest enzyme inhibition when compared with low doses applied to intact mitochondria (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these results suggest that Zn2+ enters the mitochondrial matrix prior to pore opening, resulting in irreversible inactivation of LADH and GR + TR. Enzyme inactivation was observed in coupled mitochondria for all respiration substrates tested (succinate, succinate/rotenone, glutamate/malate, α-ketoglutarate, isocitrate). LADH inactivation is well fit by a single exponential (Fig. 4A), whereas GR + TR inactivation is biphasic (Fig. 4B). The initial phase of the GR + TR pool inactivates more rapidly and is more sensitive to Zn2+ than LADH, although the residual GR + TR activity remains higher than LADH (Fig. 4F, compare curves). The biphasic response reflects the complex composition of the GR + TR pool. The order of sensitivity to Zn2+ is TR ≫ LADH > GR. 3I. G. Gazaryan, I. P. Krasinskaya, S. V. Kazakov, I. V. Uporov, A. B. Gorovits, A. A. Turanov, V. N. Gladyshev, and A. M. Brown, submitted for publication. Therefore, we suggest that Zn2+ rapidly inactivates TR, whereas GR is less sensitive to Zn2+ than LADH. TPEN, but Not EDTA, Rescues the Intramitochondrial Enzymes from Zn2+—The enzyme inactivation observed after the addition of Zn2+ to intact mitochondria might be due to direct or indirect effects of Zn2+. An example of the indirect effects of Zn2+ is inhibition of the electron transport chain (12Skulachev V.P. Christyakov V.V. Jasaitis A.A. Smirnova E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1967; 26: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Link T.A. von Jagow G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 197: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which would increase matrix NADH levels and result in over-reduction of LADH. EDTA was previously shown to reverse inhibition of mitochondrial respiration resulting from Zn2+ binding to Complex III (17Dineley K.E. Richards L.L. Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. Mitochondrion (Kidlington). 2005; 5: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, EDTA has almost no effect on the enzyme inactivation time course (Fig. 5, A and B). This suggests that the Zn2+ binding site responsible for inactivation thiol enzymes is not on the mitochondrial membrane. Direct inhibition of matrix enzymes requires Zn2+ entry into the matrix. If this is the cause of inactivation of the enzymatic activities, then the enzymes should be rescued from inactivation by a membrane-permeable Zn2+ chelator, such as TPEN. In contrast to EDTA, TPEN stabilizes the enzyme activity to the level at the time of its addition (Fig. 5, C and D). These results are consistent with rapid Zn2+ entry into the matrix followed by direct Zn2+ action on these matrix enzymes. Once Zn2+ has entered the matrix, subsequent EDTA treatment is unable to prevent enzyme inactivation. However, TPEN penetrates the matrix and chelates Zn2+, thereby arresting the inactivation process. The enzymological evidence of Zn2+ entry into the matrix is in agreement with previous studies where intramitochondrial Zn2+ was visualized with fluorescent indicators (8Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 20Malaiyandi L.M. Vergun O. Dineley K.E.

The data presented above make it clear that sufficient Zn2+ enters the matrix to alter critical enzyme activities. Zn2+ Competes with Ca2+ for the Uniporter—As shown in Fig. 4D, inactivation of these enzymes occurs only with Zn2+ but not Ca2+ treatment, indicating that LADH and GR + TR are exclusively targets of Zn2+. In contrast, analytical treatment of swelling curves presented above (Fig. 2) revealed a kinetic step where Zn2+ and Ca2+ compete. Candidates for this competitive site include ion transporters and pore components. Several studies have suggested a role for the calcium uniporter in mitochondrial uptake of Zn2+ (11Jiang D.

Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1242-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), based upon the inhibition of Zn2+ uptake by ruthenium red. Ruthenium Red, a Ca2+ blocker (34Gunter T.E. Pfeiffer D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258 (-C786): C755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), protected GR + TR and LADH from Zn2+-induced inactivation (Fig. 6). The time course of enzyme inactivation in the presence of Ruthenium Red shows almost complete protection for LADH and partial protection for GR + TR pool (Fig. 6B). Ruthenium Red also prolonged the lag period for Zn2+-treated mitochondria (Fig. 6B). Ruthenium Red protects LADH within the whole range of Zn2+ concentrations studied, whereas the GR + TR pool appears to be more sensitive to Zn2+ concentrations above 1 μm (not shown). This difference probably reflects the greater sensitivity of TR to Zn2+.3 These results provide direct evidence for Zn2+ import through the uniporter. Relationship between Enzyme Inactivation and MPT Induction—There was a linear relationship between the characteristic time of pore opening (lag period duration) and the residual LADH or GR + TR activity preserved by the mitochondria (Fig. 7). The different slopes for GR + TR and LADH probably reflect the presence of easily inactivated TR in the GR + TR pool. The observed linear correlation does not prove that enzyme inactivation results in pore opening but suggests that perturbation of the reducing capacity may make mitochondria more susceptible to the sequence of events, such as oxidative damage, resulting in pore opening. Alternately, inactivation of flavin-dependent thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases is a marker of Zn2+ penetration into the mitochondrial matrix. Once Zn2+ has entered the matrix, it may interact with other targets that are directly relevant to the mechanism of pore opening. Conclusions—We have shown that Zn2+ can be imported through the Ca2+ uniporter into the mitochondrial matrix where it inactivates LADH, GR, and TR. Inactivation of LADH will prevent NADH (energy) production because it is the terminal component of the pyruvate, ketoglutarate, and branched chained dehydrogenase complexes. Antioxidant defense will be severely affected because LADH, TR, and GR are the major generators of reduced thiols in the matrix. Inhibition of LADH may be the mechanism underlying the loss of α-ketoglutarate-stimulated respiration in the presence of Zn2+ that we previously reported (15Brown A.M. Kristal B.S. Effron M.S. Shestopalov A.I. Ullucci P.A. Sheu K.F. Blass J.P. Cooper A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13441-13447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is supported by our preliminary observation that matrix α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activity is inhibited following treatment of intact mitochondria with Zn2+, with kinetics that appear to parallel the inactivation of LADH (data not shown). Zn2+ is mobilized following brain ischemia/reperfusion. Therefore, Zn2+ inhibition of LADH may underlie the persistent loss of flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase complex observed after transient ischemia in either heart or brain (35Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1836-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Bogaert Y.E. Sheu K.F. Hof P.R. Brown A.M. Blass J.P. Rosenthal R.E. Fiskum G. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is the entry point for carbohydrate oxidative metabolism into the Krebs cycle, Zn2+ inhibition may be the cause of the well documented depression of post-infarct oxygen utilization (37Sims N.R. Pulsinelli W.A. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1367-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to the inactivation of LADH, Zn2+-induced irreversible inactivation of glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase will likely contribute to gradual oxidation of matrix thiols, consistent with the data that the drop in enzyme activities parallels the delay in MPT induction. This raises the question of whether the thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system is directly involved in controlling the thiol (“S”-) site in MPT (38Costantini P. Chernyak B.V. Petronilli V. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6746-6751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Future work will be directed toward the elucidation of a molecular link between the inactivation of these important enzymes by Zn2+ and the opening of MPT."

The association with schizophrenia was first reported in an Icelandic population in which a NRG1 haplotype (Hapice) consisting of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two microsatellites covering the 5′-end of the gene doubled the risk for the disorder (9Stefansson H.

Four of these SNPs (SNP8NRG221132, SNP8NRG221533, SNP8NRG241930, and SNP8NRG243177 (rs6994992)) represent a 22-kb surrogate haplotype that resides in the 5′ flanking putative promoter region of NRG1 directly upstream of the novel E187 exon, which is unique to the NRG1 type IV isoform (7Steinthorsdottir V.

However, evidence for a relationship between genetic risk in the gene and increased expression of type I mRNA in the brain was inconclusive. Subsequently, Law et al. (10Law A.J. Lipska B.K. Weickert C.S. Hyde T.M. Straub R.E. Hashimoto R. Harrison P.J. Kleinman J.E. Weinberger D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This finding suggests a novel molecular mechanism for the genetic association of the Hapice region of NRG1 with schizophrenia, implicating specifically the type IV isoform. Moreover, based on the location of rs6994992 (in the proximal promoter of NRG1, 1.2 kb upstream of the transcription start site (TSS)) and on the in silico prediction that the SNP maps to a serum response element, Law et al. (10Law A.J. Lipska B.K. Weickert C.S. Hyde T.M. Straub R.E. Hashimoto R. Harrison P.J. Kleinman J.E. Weinberger D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, other studies have demonstrated that Hapice, and especially rs6994992, is linked to aspects of altered brain function (13Hall J. Whalley H.C. Job D.E. Baig B.J. McIntosh A.M. Evans K.L.

Psychiatry. 2007; (, in press)Google Scholar) providing convergent evidence for an important biological role for genetic regulation of the NRG1 gene, in particular the type IV isoform, in normal brain function and the development of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the biology of NRG1 type IV or even the structure of its full-length transcripts. Given the discovery of the potential relevance of NRG1 type IV to genetic risk for schizophrenia, gaining knowledge of its full-length structure, its cell-type specific and transcriptional regulation, and whether it is translated into a protein is a critical step toward understanding its role in human brain development and disease. In the present study, we have isolated and comprehensively characterized full-length cDNA clones of NRG1 type IV from the fetal and adult human brain and identified novel splice variants of the NRG1 gene belonging to the type IV family. We have also performed expression profiling of a number of human tissues and show that NRG1 type IV undergoes cell-type specific regulation (unlike NRG1 types I-III), in the context of it being exclusively expressed in the brain at both the mRNA and protein level. NRG1 type IV is also more abundant in the fetal brain, where novel type IV splice variants were identified, indicating potentially unique functions of this gene during human brain development. In addition, we have isolated and characterized ∼1.5 kb of the type IV promoter and demonstrate allelic-specific differences related to rs6994992 in promoter activity and promoter competition with a neighboring NRG1 promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of rs6994992 in the context of the 1.5-kb promoter confirmed differential allele-specific promoter activity. Overall, these data demonstrate that the schizophrenia risk-associated SNP, rs6994992, is a functional promoter variant associated with schizophrenia genetic predisposition and NRG1 type IV expression. Molecular Cloning and Characterization of NRG1 Type IV cDNA Clones: RT-PCR and cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—To isolate full-length cDNA clones encoding type IV splice isoforms of the human NRG1 gene, RT-PCR and primer-specific amplifications were performed using human brain and human fetal brain cDNAs. Marathon-Ready cDNA libraries were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Adult human brain cDNA libraries were generated using total RNA from the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Clontech, BD Biosciences, and Ambion (Austin, TX), respectively). For construction of human cDNA libraries, 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a total volume of 20 μl by using SuperScript™III (Invitrogen) primed with oligo(dT)20 according to manufacturer’s instructions. After reverse transcription, the cDNA product was digested with 2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 min. Two microliters of the first-strand cDNA was employed in PCR amplification using Platinum TaqDNA Polymerase High Fidelity (Invitrogen). RT-PCR primers for full-length NRG1 type IV transcript amplification were designed specific to the unique 5′ exon E187 of NRG1 type IV (E187_s3, 5′-GGCAGCAGCATGGGGAAAGGA-3′) overlapping the putative translation start site and reverse primers specific for the conserved termination exon of the NRG1 gene, the a-tail (E846;Atail_anti2, 5′-AGGTTTTATACAGCAATAGGGTCTT-3′). To identify potential transcripts containing a cytoplasmic b-tail (E778), we used a reverse primer located in the a-b-tail junction (a/bjunc anti 1, 5′-TAGCAGGGAGGCTGTTACTGTCAT-3′). Reverse primers for full-length cloning of type IV were designed specific to exon E846 based on previous data, suggesting that NRG1 type IV represents a class of Ig-containing NRG1 variants (7Steinthorsdottir V. Stefansson H. Ghosh S. Birgisdottir B. Bjornsdottir S. Fasquel A.C. Olafsson O. Stefansson K. Gulcher J.R. Gene. 2004; 342: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the vast majority of Ig-NRG1 variants (types I and II) E846 represents the conserved termination exon. To search for the potential existence of rare b-cytoplasmic tail variants (2Falls D.L. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we used a reverse primer in the a-b-tail junction that would delineate a b-tail from the common a-tail. Long range PCR was performed as follows: 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 68 °C for 6 min. After the last cycle, extension was conducted at 68 °C for 10 min. PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide, and the DNA bands were visualized with a Kodak EDAS 290 imaging setup that consists of an orange band pass filter, a Kodak DC290 Camera, and a 302 nm UVA transilluminator. A fragment of ∼1.8 kb was excised from the gel for each individual sample and purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The purified fragment was cloned into either pCR®-XL-TOPO or pCR®2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently transformed into TOP10F-competent cells (Invitrogen). Five-to-ten-well isolated colonies were picked up and grown at 37 °C, 225 rpm overnight. The plasmid miniprep DNAs were prepared from 1.5 ml of bacterial cultures by using QIAprep®Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen). The insert in selected clones was bidirectionally sequenced by the BigDye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with M13 primers (M13forward, 5′-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3′; M13reverse, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′). For deeper sequencing of the inserts and confirmation of clone sequences generated with M13 primers, additional purified plasmid DNAs were resequenced using a “primer walking” strategy with a set of NRG1 sequencing primers designed to the conserved exons within the NRG1 gene (supplemental data, Table 1). The combination of these primers covered the full-length coding region of NRG1 type IV. Sequence data were constructed using the Sequencher software (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI), and the exon structure of each clone was determined by aligning the cDNA sequence to the genomic DNA sequence of the human NRG1 gene (Gen-Bank™ BK000383). Nucleotide Sequence Accession—The cDNA sequences of the NRG1 type IV splice variants have been submitted to the Gen-Bank™ data base under accession numbers EF372273-EF372277 and EF517295-EF517297. The NRG1 genomic DNA sequence used in comparison with the NRG1 type IV cDNA sequences has the GenBank™ accession number BK000383. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Analysis of NRG1 Type IV Expression in Human Tissues—To investigate whether NRG1 type IV is expressed in a panel of selected human tissues, qRT-PCR assays were performed using cDNAs constructed from poly(A)+ mRNA or total RNA from human heart, skeletal muscle, breast tumor, liver, lung, testis, adult hippocampus, fetal brain (Clontech BD Biosciences), human B lymphoblast, and human monocyte cell lines. The human cell lines were derived from normal volunteers participating in studies at the National Institutes of Health. NRG1 type IV mRNA expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system with 384-well format (Applied Biosystems) as described previously (10Law A.J. Lipska B.K. Weickert C.S. Hyde T.M. Straub R.E. Hashimoto R. Harrison P.J. Kleinman J.E. Weinberger D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The forward primer for qRT-PCR amplification overlaps with that used for RT-PCR amplification of NRG1 type IV in the cloning experiments. Co-amplification and normalization of NRG1 type IV mRNA levels were to the internal control gene, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). Fold changes in expression were calculated as 2-ΔΔ CT (cycle at threshold) relative to adult human hippocampus. For comparison, NRG1 types I, II, and III were measured in the same panel of cDNAs as described previously (10Law A.J. Lipska B.K. Weickert C.S. Hyde T.M. Straub R.E. Hashimoto R. Harrison P.J.

Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using an antibody to the a-tail cytoplasmic domain of NRG1 (neuregulin-1a/b1/2 (C-20) (sc-348, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 20 μg of protein from human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, fetal brain, human heart, and skeletal muscle (Clontech, Protein Medleys) and lymphocytes and monocytes was denatured in 4× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 0.75 μl of 1.0 m dithiothreitol at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated by gel electrophoresis using NuPAGE 4-12% bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The sc-348 antibody dilution was 1:200. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 0.1%) and incubated for 1 h with 1:2000 goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Membranes were washed five times (for 5 min each) with TBS-T. Horseradish peroxidase-immunoreactive protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting analysis system (RPN2109, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Kodak scientific imaging film. Prestained Kaleidoscope standards were used for product size determination (Bio-Rad, 161-0324) Blots were stripped using Restore Western blot stripping buffer (21062, Pierce Biotechnology) and reprobed with 1:5000 anti-β-actin antibody (A5441, Sigma). Construction of Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Plasmids, DNA Sequencing, Cell Culture, Transfection, and Measurement of NRG1 Promoter Activity—To investigate whether a mechanism of the genetic association of the 5′ region of NRG1 with schizophrenia involves transcriptional regulation, we used a combined approach of bioinformatic modeling and informed promoter-luciferase fusion experiments. To test whether the 5′ flanking region of the NRG1 gene upstream of E187 represents a functional promoter and rs6994992 represents a cis-acting regulatory element, a 1.5-kb fragment of the human NRG1 gene 5′ to the type IV transcription initiation site was amplified by PCR and used in the construction of luciferase fusion plasmids. PCR primers were designed based on human GenBank™ sequence BK000383 (forward primer F-1500, 5′-GCAGAGCCATCAATGAGGTCA-3′; reverse primer R2, 5′-CTGGGAGTGAGAGGTGACGCTTCA-3′). To examine the effects of genetic variation specifically at rs6994992, promoter fragments were amplified from separate control individuals based on genotype at this SNP. Each construct was compared in single experiments. The recombinants pGL4.SNPC and pGL4.SNPT represent the ancestral and derived alleles, respectively, at rs6994992. Furthermore, to confirm that rs6994992 per se is the functional SNP responsible for differential promoter activity, we used the 1.5-kb pGL4.SNPT construct as a template for site-directed mutagenesis of rs6994992. Single mutants were generated with the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Strategene) with mutagenic primers to convert T to C at rs6994992 (supplemental Table 1). All mutagenic reactions were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions, and all constructs were verified by direct sequencing. Because gene transcription can be regulated by promoter competition (15Choi O.R. Engel J.D. Cell. 1988; 55: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 16Conte C. Dastugue B. Vaury C. EMBO. J. 2002; 21: 3908-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the NRG1 type IV promoter may be comparatively inefficient (based on low expression levels in the brain (10Law A.J. Lipska B.K. Weickert C.S. Hyde T.M. Straub R.E. Hashimoto R. Harrison P.J. Kleinman J.E. Weinberger D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6747-6752Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar)) compared with the neighboring promoter for the type II isoform, we sought insight into neighboring NRG1 promoter localization and activity through the use of a Markov model-based statistical tool for promoter detection (17Ohler U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5943-5950Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on bioinformatic predictions we also amplified promoter constructs containing DNA sequence upstream of E187 and into the type II exon TSS including: 1) 1.5 kb upstream of the type IV TSS combined with the downstream tandem promoter for the type II isoform (forward primer F-1500, 5′-GCAGAGCCATCAATGAGGTCA-3′; reverse primer -215B, 5′-CTTCTGGCTGTCGGTTCGGACT-3′); 2) 2 kb upstream of the type IV TSS combined with the downstream tandem promoter for the type II isoform (forward primer F-2000, 5′-TTGGAGAGATGGGAGTAAAACT-3′; reverse primer -215B, 5′-CTTCTGGCTGTCGGTTCGGACT-3′); and 3) 3 kb upstream of the type IV TSS combined with the downstream tandem promoter for the type II isoform (forward primer F-3000, 5′-GGAAGATTCAAGATGGAGGGGA-3′; reverse primer -215B, 5′-CTTCTGGCTGTCGGTTCGGACT-3′). Type IV/II promoter fusion constructs were generated from the SNP-T individual above and were used for comparison with the NRG1 type IV-only promoter constructs to determine the relative strengths of these regions to drive gene expression in vitro. All promoter PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the polylinker region of pGL4.10 (Promega) using standard molecular techniques. The promoter region sequences obtained by PCR were verified by direct sequence analysis using M13 forward and reverse primers. Orientations of all promoter sequence constructs were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. Sequencing results were analyzed with BLAST. For transfection, a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293) was isolated and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 3-5 × 105 cells/well were seeded into 6- or 12-well plates, respectively, for transfection. NRG1 promoter-luciferase fusion plasmids (4 μg, 6-well, and 1.6 μg, 12-well; and 400 ng, 6-well, and 160 ng, 12-well) of PRL-TK plasmid (Renilla luciferase expression vector, an internal control for transfection efficiency) were co-transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pGL4-SV40 was used as a positive control promoter vector. Negative controls comprised transfection with empty pGL4.10 and no vector-transfected cell controls. All experiments were performed in triplicate and then repeated. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed. Luciferase and Renilla activity was measured in 20-μl reactions using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system kit (Promega) on a Lumat LB9507 luminometer. Levels of luciferase activity are expressed as relative light units. The ratio of firefly to Renilla relative light units was determined, and data are normalized to the pGL4.10 empty vector. To address the potential tissue and species specificity of NRG1 type IV promoter activity, we also transfected under similar conditions the following additional cell lines: Neuro 2A, SH-SY5Y, and SK-N-SH-neuroblastoma cell lines. Rat primary cortical neurons were cultured and transfected as described previously (18Sala C. Piech V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). qRT-PCR analysis of NRG1 type IV expression in these additional cell lines also was examined. Cloning, Sequencing, and Characterization of Human Full-length NRG1 Type IV cDNAs—Human NRG1 type IV full-length cDNAs were cloned from adult and fetal human brain cDNA libraries. Sequencing of cDNA clones derived from the adult human brain (hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) revealed that they contained an ∼1800-bp insert and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1770 bp encoding a putative NRG1 type IV proprotein of 590 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of ∼66 kDa. This variant corresponds to full-length NRG1 of the novel type IV family, and we termed this variant “type IV-β1a” (Fig. 1). We report that E187 has an AUG codon in the context of a Kozak sequence (CAGCATGG), potentially encoding 13 unique amino acids upstream of E178 (Fig. 1). Detailed characterization of the sequenced products aligned to the assembled genomic sequence (BK000383) revealed the presence of 11 exons (Fig. 1). Each of the 11 exons identified have been reported previously as part of the NRG1 gene and the 5′ exon structure upstream of the EGFc domain (E130) confirms identification of partial NRG1 type IV transcripts utilizing 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) in the human brain (7Steinthorsdottir V. Stefansson H. Ghosh S. Birgisdottir B. Bjornsdottir S. Fasquel A.C. Olafsson O. Stefansson K. Gulcher J.R. Gene. 2004; 342: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Characterization of the full-length NRG1 type IV transcript revealed that the 3′-exons downstream of the EGF-like domain (E130c) comprise E103, E127, E131, E207, and E846 with a termination codon, placing the transcript in the β1a′ family of NRG1 proteins (Fig. 1). These findings categorize the adult full-length type IV as a NRG1 proprotein belonging to the Ig class of EGF β-1 containing transmembrane variants with a cytoplasmic a-tail. In the fetal brain, the main full-length β1a variant of NRG1 type IV is identical to that found in the adult human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Fig. 1, Fetal A, IV-β1a). In addition two other full-length variants were identified with variability in the “spacer region” (s1/E51a and s2/E51b) downstream of the Ig-like domains (E178/122) with either the inclusion of exons E51a and E51b (Fig. 1, Fetal B) or just E51a alone (Fetal C). The ORF was maintained in both transcripts. These observations suggest that these variants represent full-length spliced versions of the adult and fetal NRG1 type IV-β1a. In addition, a transcript was identified (Fig. 1, Fetal D, IV-β1a) in the fetal brain that is identical to Fetal C but harbors a nonsense mutation (CAG/TAG) in the TMc domain (E103), creating a premature stop codon. This transcript is predicted to produce a putative truncated NRG1 type IV"
https://openalex.org/W2008541058,"FimH is a mannose-specific adhesin located on the tip of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli that is capable of mediating shear-enhanced bacterial adhesion. FimH consists of a fimbria-associated pilin domain and a mannose-binding lectin domain, with the binding pocket positioned opposite the interdomain interface. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, purified lectin and pilin domains, and docking simulations, we show here that the FimH domains interact with one another. The affinity for mannose is greatly enhanced (up to 300-fold) in FimH variants in which the interdomain interaction is disrupted by structural mutations in either the pilin or lectin domains. Also, affinity to mannose is dramatically enhanced in isolated lectin domains or in FimH complexed with the chaperone molecule that is wedged between the domains. Furthermore, FimH with native structure mediates weak binding at low shear stress but shifts to strong binding at high shear, whereas FimH with disrupted interdomain contacts (or the isolated lectin domain) mediates strong binding to mannose-coated surfaces even under low shear. We propose that interactions between lectin and pilin domains decrease the affinity of the mannose-binding pocket via an allosteric mechanism. We further suggest that mechanical force at high shear stress separates the two domains, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low affinity to a high affinity state. This shift provides a mechanism for FimH-mediated shear-enhanced adhesion by enabling the adhesin to form catch bond-like interactions that are longer lived at high tensile force.

This shift provides a mechanism for FimH-mediated shear-enhanced adhesion by enabling the adhesin to form catch bond-like interactions that are longer lived at high tensile force. Receptor-ligand specific adhesion is among the most fundamental of biological phenomena in nature. This phenomenon underlies eukaryotic cell-cell or cell-surface attachment, initiates recognition and signaling events, binds bacteria or viruses to target cells, and mediates biofilm formation on medical implants. Usually, the adhesion is mediated by protein-protein, protein-lipid, or often, protein-saccharide interactions (1Deller M.C. Yvonne Jones E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Most of these adhesive interactions occur under a certain level of tensile force that arises from shear stress. Whereas a number of receptor-ligand binding interactions are weakened by tensile force, recent studies have shown that certain physiologically important biomolecular interactions can be enhanced by mechanical force (2Isberg R.R. Barnes P. Cell. 2002; 110: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 3Konstantopoulos K. Hanley W.D. Wirtz D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13 (-R613): R611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Zhu C. McEver R.P. Mol. Cell Biomech. 2005; 2: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies have exposed a novel, so-called catch bond, mode of receptor-ligand adhesion, the precise structural mechanism for it remains elusive. One type of receptor-ligand interaction that is enhanced by mechanical force is that of the most common family of bacterial adhesins, mannose-specific type 1 fimbriae. In Escherichia coli, mannose-specific adhesion is mediated by the FimH adhesin at the tip of type 1 fimbriae. FimH has two domains, the mannose-binding lectin domain (Ld) 4The abbreviations used are: Ld, lectin domain; Pd, pilin domain; aa, amino acid(s); 1M, monomannose; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MD, molecular dynamics. (1–156 aa) and the fimbria-incorporating pilin domain (Pd) (160–273 aa), which are connected via a 3-aa interdomain linker peptide chain (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The Ld is a β-barrel fold with the monomannose (1M)-binding site located at its distal end, opposite from the interface between the Ld and Pd. We have shown that shear stress enhances FimH-mediated binding of E. coli to both eukaryotic cells and 1M-coated surfaces. This enhanced binding results in increased bacterial accumulation and adhesion strength on the mannosylated surface under increased flow conditions (6Thomas W.E. Nilsson L. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 7Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations within FimH (that are predominantly found in uropathogenic E. coli) have been shown to increase adhesion to a 1M-surface up to 15-fold under static or low shear conditions (8Sokurenko E.V. Chesnokova V. Doyle R.J. Hasty D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17880-17886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whereas many of the mutations are located in various regions of the Ld, some are found in the Pd, with majority of all mutations located around the interdomain interface. The shear-enhanced adhesion of FimH is reminiscent of shear-dependent rolling of leukocytes on the endothelium surface mediated by the interaction between P- and L-selectin protein and Lewis X antigen oligosaccharides (9Finger E.B. Puri K.D. Alon R. Lawrence M.B. von Andrian U.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The FimH and P- and L-selectin-mediated binding have been suggested to occur via a catch bond mechanism (2Isberg R.R. Barnes P.

This mechanism differs from a slip bond of traditional interactions that are inhibited by force. Despite data that show longer interaction lifetimes with increasing force (10Thomas W.E. Forero M.

Here we show that the fimbriae-anchoring Pd could play a direct role in modulating the activity of the mannose-binding Ld. This modulation occurs through interdomain interactions that keep the Ld in the 1M weak-binding state. This state can switch to a 1M strong-binding state when the Ld is separated from Pd. Thus, the interdomain regulation we report here provides a mechanism for switching from weak to strong binding under high shear stress. Reagents—Monomannosylated-BSA (Man1-BSA) was a generous gift of Dr. Y. C. Lee, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Strains—Recombinant strains utilized here were constructed using a fim null K-12 derivative, AAEC191A (provided by Dr. Ian Blomfield, University of Kent, UK), and were described previously (15Sokurenko E.V.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Structural replacements and mutations were introduced as described previously (6Thomas W.E. Nilsson L. Forero M. Sokurenko E.V. Vogel V. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Bacterial Binding—Static assays of bacterial adhesion to immobilized 1M/ligands (1M/BSA or yeast mannan) were carried out in 96-well plates as described previously (15Sokurenko E.V. Schembri M.A. Trintchina E. Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Binding under shear stress were performed using parallel plate flow chambers as described in Ref. 7Thomas W.E. Trintchina E. Forero M. Vogel V. Sokurenko E.V. Cell. 2002; 109: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar. Rolling adhesion was defined as movement of greater than one bacterial radius in 1 s. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed in general as described previously (16Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In brief, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain L40 with the yeast his3 gene as a reporter that, when properly expressed, enables yeast growth on medium lacking histidine. Expression of his3 in L40 is driven by the minimal his3 promoter fused to multimerized binding sites for the DNA-binding protein LexA. Gene regions encoding for Ld of different variants of FimH were cloned to create in-frame fusion with the LexA DNA-binding domain, whereas different variants of Pd (with self-complementing β-strand) were cloned to create in-frame fusion with the activation domain of transcriptional activator VP16. Both expression vectors, carrying LexA-Ld and VP16-Pd fusions, were transformed into strain L40 and productive interaction between Ld and Pd were detected by the ability of transformants to grow on plates of minimal YNB media lacking histidine with and without 3-aminotriazole inhibitor of the his3 protein. Interdomain Docking—Docking predictions were performed using the docking mode of the Rosetta program (17Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The sequences of the Ld and Pd from the FimH variant of the starting crystal structure were identical to the FimHK12 variant used in these studies. To isolate the two domains for the docking predictions, the linker chain residues (Pro157–Gly159) and the FimC chaperone molecule were computationally removed from the x-ray structure of FimH (Protein Data Bank code 1klf (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)). The domains were allowed to move freely relatively to each other in the predictions, although there was a distance constraint of 13.0 Å between the C-terminal residue of the Ld and N-terminal residue of Pd to ensure the linker chain connection in the docked structure. A total of 5,000 models were generated followed by clustering of the top 200 scoring models (17Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) and five models were selected based on their relative score rank among all models. However, two of the top-scoring models presented severe conformational constrains that would have prevented repositioning the linker chain between the domains, whereas another model created overlaps between the Ld and groove into which the β-strand of the FimC chaperone and, in native fimbriae, the FimG subunit is being incorporated. The remaining two models were identical within 0.9 Å and included the highest scoring model. The highest scoring model was selected from the five models and the interdomain linker was successfully rebuilt in the selected model using the loop mode of the Rosetta program (19Rohl C.A. Strauss C.E. Misura K.M. Baker D. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 383: 66-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar). Steered Molecular Dynamics—Domain-domain interactions were examined using molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics simulations. All simulations were performed using NAMD 2.5, which was developed by the Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group in the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (20Kale L. Skeel R. Bhandarkar M. Brunner R. Gursoy A. Krawetz N. Phillips J. Shinozaki A. Varadarajan K. Schulten K. J. Comput. Phys. 1999; 151: 283-312Crossref Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). To set up the simulations, α-d-mannose and crystal waters were aligned to the docked structure based on the x-ray crystal structure (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The Pd from the docked structure was aligned to the Pd from the crystal structure (PDB code 1klf (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar)) and we selected the coordinates of residues Asn101–Ile111 from the chaperone FimC. These coordinates match an alignment that simulates the donor β-strand of the FimHC complex (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D.

The final structure was solvated in a periodic box of explicit water molecules that ranged in size from 129 to 140 × 78–91 × 84–91 Å3. Disulfide bonds were assumed between residues Cys3:Cys44 and Cys161:Cys187. Residue His45 was assumed to have both nitrogen atoms protonated due to the position of the negatively charged Asp47 and Asp100 residues (18Hung C.S. Bouckaert J. Hung D. Pinkner J. Widberg C. DeFusco A. Auguste C.G. Strouse R. Langermann S. Waksman G. Hultgren S.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 903-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Ions (sodium and chlorine) were randomly added to the water box to: 1) give the solvent an ionic strength of 150 mm and 2) ensure the system had a zero net charge as required for the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm. The computational mutation (A188D) was performed on the docked structure using the side chain prediction algorithm SCRWL3.0 (21Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed using a 1-fs time step. Minimization was carried out in 80 steps and four stages to allow the entire system to reach a stable energy minimum. Thermalization was achieved in 40 ps by increasing the temperature in steps of 10 K every 1 ps until a final temperature of 310 K. Equilibration was conducted for 2 ns. During equilibration, the system was held at a temperature of 310 K and anisotropically coupled to a Berendsen pressure piston. The pressure was set to 1.013 bar with a relaxation time of 1 ps and a compressibility factor of 4.57 × 10-5 bar-1. To simulate separation of the two domains by mechanical force, the Cα atom on the N terminus of the donor β-strand (FimC Asn101) was pulled with a constant force in one direction and the O-1 atom of α-d-mannose was pulled with an equal force in the opposite direction.

Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB media to A600 = 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, with induction continuing overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and periplasmic fractions were prepared using osmotic shock. Periplasmic proteins were precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate and dialyzed overnight in 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole. His-tagged proteins were purified on Ni-NTA-agarose according to standard procedures (Qiagen Inc.), dialyzed in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, and further purified on gel filtration column Superdex-75. Pd-His6 Expression and Purification—Pilin domain (residues 160–279) with dsc-extension was created as described for dsc-FimH (24Barnhart M.M. Pinkner J.S. Soto G.E. Sauer F.G. Langermann S.

Expression, periplasmic preparation, and purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was done as described for Ld (see above). Ni-NTA-purified fraction was dialyzed in 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.25, and loaded on a HiTrap CM column. Pd containing fraction was eluted in 50 mm NaAc, pH 5.25, buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and further fractionated on Superdex 75 gel filtration column. Purification of Fimbrial Tips—Genes encoding for FimC (with His6 tag at the C-terminal end) and FimF-FimG-FimH were cloned into the pRSET-B expression plasmid. Expression, preparation of periplasmic fraction, and purification on Ni-NTA-agarose was done as described above. A FimC-His6-FimFGH containing fraction after elution from Ni-NTA-agarose was dialyzed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5 m NaCl and loaded on α-d-mannose-agarose column. After extensive washing tips were eluted with 10% α-d-mannose and fractionated on Superdex 75 gel filtration column. Binding of the tips to the Co2+ beads was done as described for Ld-His6. FimC-FimH Complex Purification—Genes encoding for FimC and FimH were cloned in tandem in pRSET-C plasmid under control of the T7 promoter. Plasmid was transformed into BL21Star cells. Expression and purification of the complex was done as described previously (57Jones C.H. Pindner J.S. Nicholes A.V. Slonim L.N. Abraham S.N. Hultgren S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bead-anchored FimH Construct Binding—Dynabeads® Talon™ Co2+ beads (Dynal Biotech) were coated with His-tagged FimH constructs as advised by the manufacturer using 0.22 μm protein per 10 μl of beads. Briefly, beads were washed in sodium phosphate buffer with 0.1% Tween 20, mixed with protein, and rotated for 20 min at room temperature, then washed 5 times with 0.75 ml of same buffer. Prepared beads were used in parallel plate flow chamber experiments at a final dilution of 1:1000 in the same way as whole bacteria. Solution Affinity Measurement—Solution affinity of purified fimbriae, fimbrial tips, and Ld was measured by surface plasmon resonance on Biacore2000™ (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) in solution competition experiments according to protocols described in the BIAevaluation Handbook (Biacore). In brief, 1M-BSA was immobilized on a CM5 censor chip via amino coupling at 2000 resonance units (2000 pg of ligand mm-2). A series of concentrations of fimbriae, tips, and Ld were injected over the 1M-BSA ligand at a flow rate of 20 ml min-1 in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore, Inc.) at 25 °C. To obtain the calibration curve, the average response value at a certain time point (in a 5-s time window) was plotted against concentration of the analyte. The fixed concentration of fimbriae, tips, or Ld (used for the calibration curve) was pre-equilibrated with several concentrations of α-methyl-d-mannopyranoside (1M) and injected over the same surface. The average response value at the same time point as above was determined, and the concentration of free analyte (not bound to mannose in solution and therefore able to bind mannose immobilized on the chip) was calculated using the calibration curve. Free analyte was plotted against the concentration of 1 m, and solution affinity analysis was performed to determine solution affinity (KD, M) using a general fit solution affinity in BIAevaluation software 3.0 (Biacore AB, Inc.). All experiments were performed at least twice with every curve in triplicates, different chips, sugar batches, and protein preparations used. Structural Alteration of the Pilin Domain Increases Mannose Binding of FimH—We previously compared the 1M-specific binding of bacteria expressing a hybrid adhesin containing residues 1–185 (including the entire Ld and N-terminal part of Pd) of the FimH variant from E. coli K12 (FimHK12) and residues 186 to 273 (the rest of Pd) of the adhesin FocH, which has 80% homology to FimH (15Sokurenko E.V. Schembri M.A. Trintchina E. Kjaergaard K. Hasty D.L. Klemm P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The hybrid exhibited very strong 1M binding activity under static conditions relative to FimHK12, suggesting an importance of the pilin domain to binding. At the same time, replacement of 202–273 residues with the corresponding FocH sequence did not affect binding (see supplemental Table 1S). Considering the results of the previous study, here we replaced residues 186–201 (YCAKSQNLGYYLSGTH) within the Pd of FimHK12 with the corresponding sequence from FocH (RCDQTQSVSYTLSGSV) to look in more detail at the influence of Pd structure on 1M binding. This FimHK12: (186–201)FocH mutant exhibited very strong 1M binding (Table 1). To probe the exact mutations that are responsible for the change in phenotype, we screened a number of point substitutions within this sequence of 16 aa. Whereas most point replacements did not affect the FimHK12 phenotype (for some examples, see supplemental Table 1S), two substitutions, Y186R and A188D, increased 1M binding significantly (Table 1). Of these two mutations, A188D resulted in the largest change in 1M binding.TABLE 1Strength of FimH-mediated binding in static conditions Binding of isogenic bacteria to immobilized 1M-BSA under static conditions (all binding is >90% inhibitable by mannose) and affinity of purified fimbriae, fimbrial tips, and lectin domains to soluble mannose in SPR experiments.

We have shown previously that neither the amount of FimH presented on the bacterial surface nor the fimbriae morphology change when a high 1M-binding mutant FimH or FimH/FocH hybrid is expressed (15Sokurenko E.V.

Here also, the fimbriae purified from the surface of bacteria expressing either FimHK12 or mutant FimH had the same amount of FimH (see supplemental Fig. 1S). To determine whether the increased 1M binding of bacteria was due an exposure of an additional 1M binding site within the mutant FimH, we introduced the mutation Q133A into FimH. This mutation alters a critical mannose-interacting residue within the only 1M binding pocket identified in the crystal structure (5Choudhury D. Thompson A. Stojanoff V. Langermann S. Pinkner J. Hultgren S.J. Knight S.D. Science. 1999; 285: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). The Q133A replacement completely abolished the 1M-specific adhesion mediated by either FimHK12 or the FimHK12:A188D mutant (see supplemental Table 1S), demonstrating that the 1M high-binding FimH variants do not expose an additional 1M-binding site. Thus, the observed changes in 1M binding appear to be due to increased affinity of the 1M binding pocket in the mutant FimH. To test this directly, purified fimbriae from the FimHK12, FimHK12:(186–201)FocH, and FimHK12:A188D were examined for their solution affinity to soluble mannose using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Indeed, the affinity of the 1M high-binding FimH variants increased dramatically relatively to FimHK12, more than 15-fold in FimHK12:A188D and almost 300-fold in FimHK12:(186–201)FocH (Table 1). The same results were obtained when recombinant fimbrial tips were used that incorporate FimHK12 or FimHK12:A188D (Table 1). The fimbrial tips are composed of sequentially assembled FimH, FimG, and FimF subunits (with FimF complexed with His6-tagged FimC chaperone). Unlike fimbriae, however, these tips lack the polymeric major subunit FimA that forms the fimbrial rod. Together, these results demonstrate that the increase in 1M binding of FimH with the altered Pd structure is due to an increase in affinity toward the 1M ligand in a single FimH binding pocket located on the tip of the Ld. Thus, it appears that the binding pocket in the Ld can assume a low-affinity conformational state toward 1M in FimHK12 and a high-affinity state toward the 1M high-binding FimH variants.

https://openalex.org/W2108918917,"Until now, the glycation reaction was considered to be a nonspecific reaction between reducing sugars and amino groups of random proteins. We were able to identify the intermediate filament vimentin as the major target for the AGE modification Nɛ-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) in primary human fibroblasts. This glycation of vimentin is neither based on a slow turnover of this protein nor on an extremely high intracellular expression level, but remarkably it is based on structural properties of this protein. Glycation of vimentin was predominantly detected at lysine residues located at the linker regions using nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS. This modification results in a rigorous redistribution of vimentin into a perinuclear aggregate, which is accompanied by the loss of contractile capacity of human skin fibroblasts. CML-induced rearrangement of vimentin was identified as an aggresome. This is the first evidence that CML-vimentin represents a damaged protein inside the aggresome, linking the glycation reaction directly to aggresome formation. Strikingly, we were able to prove that the accumulation of modified vimentin can be found in skin fibroblasts of elderly donors in vivo, bringing AGE modifications in human tissues such as skin into strong relationship with loss of organ contractile functions."
https://openalex.org/W2007631186,"Isoflavones, a class of flavonoids, play very important roles in plant-microbe interactions in certain legumes such as soybeans (Glycine max L. Merr.). G. max UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase (GmIF7GT) is a key enzyme in the synthesis of isoflavone conjugates, which accumulate in large amounts in vacuoles and serve as an isoflavonoid pool that allows for interaction with microorganisms. In this study, the 14,000-fold purification of GmIF7GT from the roots of G. max seedlings was accomplished. The purified enzyme is a monomeric protein of 46 kDa, catalyzing regiospecific glucosyl transfer from UDP-glucose to isoflavones to produce isoflavone 7-O-β-d-glucosides (kcat = 0.74 s-1, Km for genistein = 3.6 μm, and Km for UDP-glucose = 190 μm). The GmIF7GT cDNA was isolated based on the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis showed that GmIF7GT is a novel member of glycosyltransferase family 1 and is distantly related to Glycyrrhiza echinata UDP-glucose:isoflavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase. The purified enzyme was unexpectedly devoid of the N-terminal 49-residue segment and thus lacks the histidine residue corresponding to the proposed catalytic residue of glycosyltransferases from Medicago truncatula (UGT71G1) and Vitis vinifera (VvGT1). The results of kinetic studies of site-directed mutants of GmIF7GT showed that both His-15 and Asp-125, which correspond to the catalytic residues of UGT71G1 and VvGT1, are not important for GmIF7GT activity. The results also suggest that an acidic residue at position 392 is very important for primary catalysis of GmIF7GT. These results led to the proposal that GmIF7GT utilizes a strategy of catalysis that is distinct from those proposed for UGT71G1 and VvGT1.

Isoflavones are a class of plant flavonoids with a 3-phenylchromone structure and occur predominantly in legumes, where these flavonoids play very important roles in plant-microbe interactions. For example, the isoflavone genistein is excreted from soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) roots to serve as a signaling molecule in rhizobia-mediated nodulation of this plant (1Phillips D. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Recent Adv. Phytochem. 1992; 26: 201-231Google Scholar, 2Hungria M. Stacey G. Soil Biol. Biochem. 1997; 29: 819-830Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). They are also involved in defensive mechanisms of legumes against pathogen infection (3Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. 1992: 139-164Google Scholar, 4Graham T. Graham M. Stacey G. Keen N.T. Plant-Microbe Interactions. 5. 2000: 181-220Google Scholar). Moreover, isoflavones exhibit a wide variety of bioactivities that are beneficial to human health (5Wiseman H. Andersen Ø.M. Markham K.R. Flavonoids: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Applications. 2006: 371-396Google Scholar). The isoflavonoid skeleton is derived from (2S)-flavanones, a class of general flavonoid intermediates that undergo 2-hydroxylation catalyzed by 2-hydroxyflavanone synthase, a microsomal cytochrome P450 enzyme (see Fig. 1) (6Akashi T. Aoki T. Ayabe S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Steele C.L. Gijzen M. Qutob D. Dixon R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In G. max and some other legumes, the resulting product, 2,5,7,4′-tetrahydroxyisoflavanone or 2,7,4′-trihydroxyisoflavanone, then undergoes enzymatic dehydration to produce genistein or daidzein, respectively (8Akashi T. Aoki T. Ayabe S. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting isoflavone aglycons are 7-O-glucosylated and subsequently 6″-O-malonylated (9Suzuki H. Nishino T. Nakayama T. Phytochemistry. 2007; 10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.05.017Google Scholar) to produce isoflavone conjugates, which then accumulate in vacuoles (3Barz W. Welle R. Stafford H. Ibrahim R. Phenolic Metabolism in Plants. 26. 1992: 139-164Google Scholar). The release of aglycons from these conjugates is catalyzed by an isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase. We showed previously that, in G. max seedlings, this β-glucosidase is localized exclusively in the root apoplast (10Suzuki H. Takahashi S. Watanabe R. Fukushima Y. Fujita N. Noguchi A. Yokoyama R.

Most biological and biomedical activities of isoflavones have been identified with their aglycon forms (4Graham T. Graham M. Stacey G. Keen N.T.

Flavonoids: Chemistry, Biochemistry and Applications. 2006: 371-396Google Scholar). Therefore, the conjugation of isoflavones is important for controlling the interactions of legumes with their symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms as well as the dietary effects of these flavonoids on human health. The 7-O-glucosylation is the first step of isoflavone conjugation and is specifically catalyzed by G. max UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase (GmIF7GT) 2The abbreviations used are: GmIF7GT, G. max UDP-glucose:isoflavone 7-O-glucosyltransferase; PSPGs, plant secondary product glycosyltransferases; VvGT1, V. vinifera UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase-1; IFGT, UDP-glucose:isoflavone glucosyltransferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; RACE, rapid amplification cDNA ends; AmC4′GT, A. majus UDP-glucose:chalcone 4′-O-glucosyltransferase; LvC4′GT, L. vulgaris UDP-glucose:chalcone 4′-O-glucosyltransferase; SbB7GAT, S. baicalensis UDP-glucuronate:baicalein 7-O-glucuronosyltransferase; GeIF7GT, G. echinata UDP-glucose:isoflavonoid 7-O-glucosyltransferase.

However, the primary structure and phylogenetics of this important glycosyltransferase of G. max have long remained unclear, mainly because of the difficulty of enzyme purification. Glycosyltransferases generally catalyze the transfer of the glycosyl group from nucleotide diphosphate-activated sugars to acceptor molecules. A vast variety of glycosyltransferase genes have been identified thus far, which are currently classified on the basis of their phylogenetics into >70 families (12Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V.

These PSPGs are characterized by a unique well conserved sequence of ∼45 amino acid residues (called a PSPG box (14Vogt T. Jones P. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 380-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar)) and a catalytic mechanism leading to an inversion of the anomeric configuration of transferred sugar (12Campbell J.A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 34441-34447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), afforded important information relative to the mechanism and specificity of PSPG-catalyzed reactions. In both of these enzymes, a histidine residue (His-22 in UGT71G1 and His-20 in VvGT1) that is highly conserved among PSPGs is proposed to act as a key catalytic residue that activates the hydroxy group of the glucosyl acceptor molecule to facilitate glucosidic linkage formation. A well conserved aspartic acid residue (Asp-121 in UGT71G1 and Asp-119 in VvGT1) is hydrogen-bonded with the His residue and is proposed to assist in its general acid/base role during catalysis. In this study, the 14,000-fold purification of GmIF7GT from the roots of G. max seedlings was accomplished. This permitted the identification of the GmIF7GT cDNA and its phylogenetic analysis. The purified enzyme, which displayed a high glucosyl transfer activity, unexpectedly lacked an N-terminal 49-residue segment and thus was devoid of the conserved His residue (His-15 in GmIF7GT) that corresponds to the catalytically important residues His-22 in UGT71G1 and His-20 in VvGT1. This observation prompted the undertaking of the mutagenesis studies to evaluate the importance of His-15 as well as that of other conserved amino acid residues for GmIF7GT catalysis. Soybean seeds (G. max L. Merr. cv. Wase-Hakucho; Takii & Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) were pretreated with running tap water for 10 min and then germinated on planting medium containing 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.5% (w/v) agar. The roots of 7-9-day-old seedlings were washed with tap water to remove the medium and frozen at -80 °C until used. Benzoic acid, m- and p-hydroxy-benzoic acids, salicylic acid, salicyl alcohol, hydroquinone, caffeic acid, trans-p-coumaric acid, and naringenin were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto). Esculetin and esculin were from Tokyo Kasei Industries (Tokyo, Japan). Kaempferol and quercetin were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Genistein, genistin, daidzein, and daidzin were products of Fujicco Co., Ltd. (Kobe, Japan). UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, and UDP-glucuronic acid were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were analytical grade. UDP-glucose:isoflavone glucosyltransferase (IFGT) activity was measured using genistein and UDP-glucose as substrates. The standard reaction mixture (100 μl) consisted of 200 μm genistein, 200 μm UDP-glucose, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and enzyme. The mixture without enzyme was preincubated at 30 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 10-30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The reaction products were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a J’Sphere ODS-M80 column (4.6 × 150 mm; YMC, Kyoto). The substrates and products were eluted with a linear gradient of 13.5-90% (v/v) CH3CN containing 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 8 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min and detected at 260 nm using an SPD-10Avp UV-visible detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217529) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The concentration of purified GmIF7GT was determined by absorption coefficients ɛ280 = 46,410 m-1cm-1 (for the purified enzyme lacking an N-terminal 49-residue segment; see below) and 47,900 m-1cm-1 (for the full-length recombinant enzyme), which were calculated from the amino acid sequence. The initial velocity assays for GmIF7GT and its mutants were carried out under steady-state conditions using the standard assay system (see above) with varying concentrations of substrates. Apparent Km and Vmax values for glucosyl donor and acceptor substrates in the presence of a saturating concentration of their countersubstrate were determined by fitting the initial velocity data to a Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression analysis (24Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems. 1975; (, pp. , John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York): 505-664Google Scholar). All operations were performed at 4 °C. All buffers used throughout the enzyme purification contained 56 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Step 1: Preparation of Crude Extract—Frozen roots of G. max seedlings (1.2 kg) were suspended in 3800 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 16% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and disrupted in a Waring blender, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was used for further purification. Step 2: Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation—The protein fraction that precipitated between 40 and 60% saturated ammonium sulfate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was dissolved in 800 ml of buffer S1 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5)). Step 3: DEAE-Sepharose—The enzyme solution was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 51.5 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer S1 at a flow rate of 2 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.36 m NaCl in 500 min in buffer S1. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer S1 by repeated concentrations and dilutions using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Mr 30,000 cutoff; Millipore Corp.). Step 4: Q-Sepharose—The enzyme solution was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (1.6 × 31.5 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer S1 at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min using an AöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.42 m NaCl in 600 min in buffer S1. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer S1 by ultrafiltration as described above. Step 5: Phenyl-Sepharose—Ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme solution to 20% saturation. The enzyme solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose HP column (1.0 × 29 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 20% saturated ammonium sulfate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (0-100% in 480 min) of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 50% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 50 μm UDP-glucose) as described above. Step 6: Hydroxylapatite Chromatography—The enzyme solution was applied to a hydroxylapatite column (1.0 × 12.5 cm; Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (0-25% in 200 min) of 0.4 m potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 50 μm UDP-glucose. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, and 50 μm UDP-glucose) as described above. Step 7: Gel Filtration—The enzyme solution was applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (GE Health-care) equilibrated with buffer B and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and re-chromatographed under the same conditions. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer S2 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 50 μm UDP-glucose) as described above. Step 8: Resource Q—The enzyme solution was applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer S2 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.24 m NaCl in 90 min in buffer S2. The active fractions were combined and subjected to re-chromatography on Resource Q under the same conditions. The active fractions were concentrated and equilibrated with buffer C (25 mm bis-Tris/iminodiacetic acid (pH 7.1) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 50 μm UDP-glucose). Step 9: Chromatofocusing on Mono P—The enzyme solution was applied to a Mono P column (0.5 × 20 cm; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using an AöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with 10% (v/v) Polybuffer 74 (GE Healthcare)/iminodiacetic acid (pH 4.0) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and 50 μm UDP-glucose for 120 min. Fractions (0.75 ml each) were collected in a 96-well DeepWell plate (Greiner Bio-One International AG, Frickenhausen, Germany) containing 0.25 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) to avoid prolonged exposure of the enzyme to acidic pH. The active fractions were combined, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer S3 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS) as described above, thereby eliminating Polybuffer 74 from the purified enzyme. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207529) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gels were visualized by silver staining or with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the partial amino acid sequences determined (see “Results and Discussion”): IF1, 5′-GCIATHGTIATHGAYTTYATGAA-3′; IF2, 5′-TTYATGAAYTTYAAYGAYCCIAA-3′; IR1, 5′-TCICKIACICKRTCICCIARYTCIGT-3′, and IR2, 5′-TCIGTISWISWIACRAAICCRTC-3′. The total RNA was isolated from the roots of G. max seedlings using an RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a Qiagen OneStep reverse transcription-PCR kit with primers IF1 and IR1 and total RNA from the roots of G. max seedlings. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows. The reverse transcription-PCR mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min for the reverse transcriptase reaction, followed by 35 cycles of PCR (one cycle consisted of 94 °C for 30 s, 42 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) and incubation at 72 °C for 10 min. An amplified fragment was further subjected to nested PCR using primers IF2 and IR2. Thermal cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min and, finally, 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified fragment, which was ∼1 kilobase pair in length, was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and subjected to sequencing using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) with a CEQ 2000 DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). The 5′-fragment was obtained using a 5′-RACE system (Invitrogen) with primers 5GSP1 (5′-GGATTTGCAAAGGTTGGTCTGTATCC-3′), 5GSP2 (5′-GAGGGTTGGGTGAATGGTGGG-3′), and 5GSP3 (5′-GTGAATGGTGGGGTAGTAAAGGAG-3′) and total RNA from the roots of G. max seedlings. The 3′-fragment was obtained using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and KOD-Plus (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka) with primers 3GSP1 (5′-GGGTTGTGGGAACCGAGTTGG-3′), 3GSP2 (5′-GTGCTGATGACTCGGCGGAG-3′), oligo(dT) primer, and total RNA from the roots of G. max seedlings. The internal fragment was obtained using SuperScript™ II reverse transcriptase and KOD-Plus with primers F400 (5′-GCCCTCACTGAAAATCTCAACAAC-3′) and R1160 (5′-CTTCACCATAACCATCCTGTTCAT-3′) and total RNA from the roots of G. max seedlings. To obtain the full-length GmIF7GT cDNA, recombinant PCR amplification was performed using the 5′-fragment, 3′-fragment, and internal fragment as templates with primers 5Nd (5′-CATATGAAAGACACCATTGTTCTATACCC-3′, with the NdeI site underlined) and 3Ba (5′-AACGGATCCTCAACTCTGTTTCCACAGCTTAG-3′, with the BamHI site underlined). The amplified fragment was cloned into the pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector using a kit (Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit for sequencing, Invitrogen) and sequenced to confirm the absence of PCR errors. The plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragment was ligated with the pET-15b vector (Novagen) that had been previously digested with NdeI and BamHI to obtain plasmid pET-15b-GmIF7GT, which encodes an N-terminal in-frame fusion of GmIF7GT with a His6 tag. The resultant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The transformant cells were precultured at 37 °C for 16 h in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Ten milliliters of the preculture was then inoculated into 2000 ml of the same medium. After cultivation at 20 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyrano-side was added to the broth at a final concentration of 0.4 mm, followed by further cultivation at 20 °C for 15 h. All subsequent operations were conducted at 0-4 °C. The recombinant E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min, washed with distilled water, and resuspended in buffer D (20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 56 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 m NaCl). The cells were disrupted at 4 °C by 10 cycles of ultrasonication (where one cycle corresponded to 10 kHz for 1 min, followed by an interval of 1 min) or using a Multi-Beads Shocker Model MBS200 apparatus (Yasui Kikai Corp, Osaka). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. Polyethyleneimine was slowly added to the supernatant solution to a final concentration of 0.12% (v/v). The mixture was allowed to stand at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a HisTrap™ HP column (1 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with buffer D, and the enzyme was eluted with buffer D containing 0.2 m imidazole. The active fractions were collected, concentrated, and equilibrated with buffer S1 by ultrafiltration as described above. The resulting enzyme solution was applied to a Resource Q column (6 ml) equilibrated with buffer S1 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using anAöKTApurifier apparatus. The column was washed with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-0.3 m NaCl in buffer S1. The enzyme solution was concentrated and extensively dialyzed at 4 °C against buffer S3 to remove imidazole. In vitro mutagenesis of the GmIF7GT gene was carried out by recombinant PCR with plasmid pET-15b-GmIF7GT (see above) as a template and a specific mutagenesis oligonucleotide primer (data not shown) and primer F400 (see above for nucleotide sequence) or the T7 terminator primer (5′-TGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′) to obtain the site-directed mutants H15A, D125A, H359A, H368A, E376A, E392A, E456A, and E392D. The amplified fragments were digested with XhoI and BamHI, and the resulting DNA fragments were ligated with pET-15b-GmIF7GT that had been previously digested with XhoI and BamHI. Individual mutation was verified by DNA sequencing on both strands. The NΔ49 mutant was prepared by a PCR-based strategy. The GmIF7GT mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) transformant cells and purified essentially as described above. The IFGT activity in the crude extract of roots from G. max seedlings was extremely unstable to oxidation, and the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol was essential for its efficient purification. Two activity peaks of IFGT were identified by DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography (Step 3) (Table 1). These activity peaks were completely separated from each other by hydroxylapatite chromatography (Step 6), where the first eluted peak showed higher specific activity than the second one. In this study, the first eluted IFGT was further purified. The addition of CHAPS to purification buffers was also essential for purification of this IFGT activity after Step 6, otherwise the activity was irreversibly lost during column chromatography, probably because of irreversible adsorption of the enzyme to matrices of purification resins. Finally, the enzyme (termed GmIF7GT) could be purified to homogeneity with an activity yield of 2.6% after nine purification steps (Fig. 2 and Table 1). The apparently high degree of the present purification (14,000-fold) should not arise from possible underestimation of IFGT activities due to the contaminating activity of the isoflavone conjugate-hydrolyzing β-glucosidase (10Suzuki H. Takahashi S. Watanabe R. Fukushima Y. Fujita N. Noguchi A. Yokoyama R. Nishitani K. Nishino T. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30251-30259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) in the crude extracts because this β-glucosidase was inert at the pH employed for IFGT assay (pH 8.5). Purified GmIF7GT showed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 45 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2). The native molecular mass of purified GmIF7GT was estimated to be 46 kDa by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 prep grade column, indicating that the enzyme is monomeric. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme was determined by automated Edman degradation to be Thr-Thr-Thr-Leu-Ala-Cys-Asp-Ser-Asn-Ala-Gln-Tyr-Ile-Ala (termed sequence 1) (supplemental Fig. 1S). To obtain the internal amino acid sequences of the purified protein, it was digested with a lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus M497-1 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (27Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Sato T. Kikuchi S. Fukui Y. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Ueda T. Nakao M. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Nishino T. Science. 2000; 290: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of some of these peptides were determined to be Ala-Ile-Val-Ile-Asp-Phe-Met-Asn-Phe-Asn-Asp-Pro-Lys (sequence 2), Val-Ala-Leu-Ala-Val-Asn-Glu-Asn-Lys (sequence 3), Asp-Gly-Phe-Val-Ser-Ser-Thr-Glu-Leu-Gly-Asp-Arg-Val-Arg-Glu (sequence 4), and Leu-Trp-Lys (sequence 5).TABLE 1Purification of GmlF7GT from the roots of G. max seedlingsStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgpicokatalspicokatals/mg protein-fold%1.

https://openalex.org/W2100072622,"The modification of proteins by nonenzymatic glycation leading to accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is a well-established phenomenon of aging. In the eyes of elderly patients, these adducts have been observed in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), particularly within the underlying pentalaminar substrate known as Bruch's membrane. AGEs have also been localized to age-related subcellular deposits (drusen and basal laminar deposits) and are thought to play a pathogenic role in progression of the major sight-threatening condition known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The current study has quantified AGEs in Bruch's membrane from postmortem eyes and established age-related correlations. In particular, we investigated the potential of confocal Raman microscopy to identify and quantify AGEs in Bruch's membrane in a nondestructive, analytical fashion. Bruch's membrane and the innermost layers of the underlying choroid (BM-Ch) were dissected from fresh postmortem eye-cups (n=56). AGE adducts were quantified from homogenized tissue using reverse-phase HPLC and GC/MS in combination with immunohistochemistry. For parallel Raman analysis, BM-Ch was flat-mounted on slides and evaluated using a Raman confocal microscope and spectra analyzed by a range of statistical approaches. Quantitative analysis showed that the AGEs pentosidine, carboxymethyllysine (CML), and carboxyethyllysine (CEL) occurred at significantly higher levels in BM-Ch with age (P<0.05-0.01). Defined Raman spectral ""fingerprints"" were identified for various AGEs and these were observed in the clinical samples using confocal Raman microscopy. The Raman data set successfully modeled AGEs and not only provided quantitative data that compared with conventional analytical approaches, but also provided new and complementary information via a nondestructive approach with high spatial resolution. It was shown that the Raman approach could be used to predict chronological age of the clinical samples (P<0.001) and a difference in the Raman spectra between genders was highly significant (P<0.000001). With further development, this Raman-based approach has the potential for noninvasive examination of AGE adducts in living eyes and ultimately to assess their precise pathogenic role in age-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2137443892,"Recent studies strongly suggest that the cannabinoid system is a key player in cell growth control. Since the organ-culture of human hair follicles (HF) offers an excellent, clinically relevant model for complex tissue interaction systems, we have asked whether the cannabinoid system plays a role in hair growth control. Here, we show that human scalp HF, intriguingly, are both targets and sources of endocannabinoids. Namely, the endocannabinoid N-arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) as well as the exocannabinnoid delta (9) -tetrahydrocannabinol dose-dependently inhibited hair shaft elongation and the proliferation of hair matrix keratinocytes, and induced intraepithelial apoptosis and premature HF regression (catagen). These effects were inhibited by a selective antagonist of cannabinoid receptor-1 (CB1). In contrast to CB2, CB1 was expressed in a hair cycle-dependent manner in the human HF epithelium. Since we successfully identified the presence of endocannabinoids in human HF, our data strongly suggest that human HF exploit a CB1-mediated endocannabinoid signaling system for negatively regulating their own growth. Clinically, CB1 agonists may therefore help to manage unwanted hair growth, while CB1 antagonists might counteract hair loss. Finally, human HF organ culture offers an instructive, physiologically relevant new research tool for dissecting ""nonclassical"" effects of endocannabinoids and their receptor-mediated signaling in general."

Physically, motoneurons are unique, representing the longest cells in the body, with axons of some motoneurons in the spinal cord extending a meter or more to reach an end organ. As a result of this morphology, exceptional demands are placed on motoneurons. Active transport along lengthy axons is required to convey newly made materials from the cell body to the farthest nerve endings, and to convey nutrients and metabolites back to the cell body. Microtubules are an essential component of the neuron’s scaffold and represent the “roadway,” or conveyer belt, that neurons use to transport nutrients (6Tashiro T. Komiya Y. J.

Microtubule-based transport is mandatory for survival of motoneurons and muscle cells; changes in slow axonal transport have been linked to neuropathogenesis in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice (11Collard J.F.

In addition, the assembly and disassembly of microtubule polymers in motoneurons is highly responsive to cellular insults, such as excitotoxic stimuli (8McMurray C.T.

The relation between dynamics of microtubules and neuronal pathogenesis has not been explored in detail, in part due to limited techniques for measuring microtubule dynamics in vivo. In most non-neuronal cells, tubulin dimers and microtubule polymers exist in rapid dynamic equilibrium, as we have recently shown in vivo by isotopic labeling (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R.

In neurons, however, this rapid turnover of axonal and dendritic microtubules is believed to be less dynamic due to their interactions with a specific subclass of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (18Brandt R. Lee G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3414-3419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Baas P.W. Slaughter T. Brown A. Black M.M. J. Neurosci.

This stability of microtubules is presumed to be necessary to maintain the integrity of the microtubule-based axonal transport of synaptic vesicles and nutrients (21Roos J. Kelly R.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 415-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Kirkpatric L.L. Witt A.S. Payne H.R. Shine H.D. Brady S.T. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2288-2297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we hypothesized that instability of microtubules, i.e. the induction of a population of hyperdynamic microtubules, whether due to altered MAP function, intrinsic factors in the microtubules, or excitotoxic stimuli, might compromise axonal transport and represent a novel pathogenic mechanism in neurodegenerative disorders. This could then provide new therapeutic targets in motoneuron diseases, including ALS. We recently developed a stable isotope-mass spectrometric technique for quantifying the turnover kinetics of specific microtubule populations in vivo (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49940-49947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Here, we apply this technique to neurons and test the above hypothesis. We report that microtubule dynamics are abnormal in the SOD1G93A transgenic mouse model of ALS, in association with altered axonal transport. Moreover, pharmacologic interventions that reduce the fraction of hyperdynamic microtubules prevent neuronal death, restore axonal transport, delay the onset of disease, and extend survival in the SOD1G93A mouse. Genetic Background of SOD1G93A Mice, Disease Onset, and Survival—All experiments received approval from the local animal use committee and were carried out according to Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare-National Institutes of Health guidelines. Transgenic mice (female and male) carrying human SOD1 gene with a G93A mutation (TgN [SOD1-G93A] 1Gur) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory or were donated from Project A.L.S. The colony was maintained by breeding male heterozygous carriers to female B6SJLF1 hybrids. Animals were housed in a controlled temperature and humidity environment and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, with access to food and water provided ad libitum. Mice were assessed daily for survival and bi-weekly for weighing and stride length analysis starting at 10 weeks of age. The disease end point was determined as previously described (4Gurney M.E. N.

Animal Studies—Each experimental group contained age-matched drug-treated and untreated littermates. All experiments were performed blinded with coded drugs. Noscapine (an microtubule-modulating agent (MTMA)) was obtained from Sigma, and pioglitazone (Pio) and riluzole were from Takeda Pharmaceuticals and Aventis, respectively. MTMA was injected intraperitoneally at 100 mg.kg-1.d-1. Pio and riluzole were given in a diet, with a final drug dose computed to be 40 mg.kg-1.d-1 (Pio) and 44 mg.kg-1.d-1 (riluzole), based on average food consumption of 3 g of chow per mouse. The same doses and regimens were chosen for combined treatment with MTMA/riluzole or MTMA/Pio. Drugs were begun in all mice at the symptomatic age of 10 weeks and continued until the end stage (n = 23/group). In a subset of mice, microtubule dynamics were measured at 13 weeks of age (after onset of disease) to compare with untreated mice (n = 3/treatment group). Isolation of tubulin dimers and polymers is described in the supplemental materials. For 2H2O labeling, mice received an intraperitoneal bolus of 30–35 ml/kg 2H2O (99.9 mol% 2H2O) containing 0.9% w/v NaCl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), resulting in 4–5% body water 2H enrichment. Mice were then maintained on 8% 2H2O in drinking water (to allow for dilution of 2H2O by metabolic water) for 48 h prior to sacrifice. All animals tolerated the treatments well, and there were no differences in body weight among animals in different groups. Motor Function Testing (Stride Length)—Stride length was determined by painting the paws with glycerol tinted with food coloring. The test was repeated until a mouse walked in a straight line and four clear continuous stride-length measurements could be obtained. Stride length is the distance between prints made by the same paw, and taken from the center of one print to the center of the next (23Azzouz M. Ralph G.S. Storkebaum E. Walmsley L.E. Mitrophanous K.A. Kingsman S.M. Carmeliet P. Mazarakis N.D. Nature. 2004; 429: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The analysis was always carried out at the same time of the day, using age-matched transgenic untreated, treated, and control animals of mixed and same gender (n = 20). Motoneuron Survival—After transcardiac perfusion with 4% para-formaldehyde, the lumbar region of the spinal cord was removed and post-fixed for 6 h. Tissue samples were shipped to the Premier Laboratory (Boulder, CO), where 20-μm transverse sections were cut and stained with gallocyanin (Nisslstain). Nissl-stained motoneurons located within the sciatic motor pool, in which the nucleolus was clearly visible, were counted in each ventral horn on every third section between the L2 and L5 levels of the spinal cord. Processing of Tubulin for GC/MS Analysis—Tubulin samples from MTs or dimers were hydrolyzed by treatment with 6 n HCl for 16 h at 110 °C. Protein-derived amino acids were derivatized to pentafluorobenzyl derivatives, and 2H incorporation in alanine released from tubulin was measured by GC/MS, as described elsewhere (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol.

Misell M.L. Hellerstein M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). 2H enrichment was calculated as the increase, over natural abundance, in the percentage of alanine present as the (M+1) mass isotopomer (EM1). The processing and derivatization procedures for amino acid analysis remove all exchangeable hydrogen atoms (e.g. -OH and -NH bonds), so that only the 2H label incorporated into stable -CH bonds in vivo is measured (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol.

Measurement of 2H2O Enrichment in Body Water—Measurement of 2H2O enrichment in body water was measured using a modification of previously described procedures (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49940-49947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, hydrogen atoms from plasma water were transferred to acetylene by reaction with calcium carbide. Acetylene samples were then analyzed using a Series 3000 cycloidal mass spectrometer (Monitor Instruments), which was modified to record ions at m/z 26 and 27 (M0 and M1) and calibrated against a standard curve prepared by mixing 99.9% 2H2O with unlabeled water. Body water 2H enrichments were not affected by drug treatment (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—The fraction of newly synthesized alanine in each sample was calculated as the ratio of the measured EM1 value to the maximal or asymptotic value possible at the measured body water enrichment, calculated by mass isotopomer distribution analysis, as described elsewhere (26Busch R. Kim Y.K. Neese R.A. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. Awada M. Gardner J. Beysen C. Marino M.M. Misell M.L. Hellerstein M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This ratio represents the fraction of tubulin that was newly synthesized. The presence of newly synthesized tubulin in MTs represents the assembly or dynamics of polymer from free tubulin dimers during the period of label exposure. The statistical significance of drug or treatment effects was assessed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey post-hoc testing. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for survival comparisons. Software for statistics included SigmaStat 3.0 and Microsoft Excel 2003. Hyperdynamic Microtubules Accompany Impaired Axonal Transport and Disease Progression—Changes in slow axonal transport have been linked to neuropathogenesis in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice (11Collard J.F. Cote F. Julien J.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 12Sasaki S. Iwata M. Neurology. 1996; 47: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Williamson T.L. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Slow axonal transport has previously been shown to have two components, based on rates of movement of cargo: one at ∼0.5 mm/day (SCa) the other at ∼1–2 mm/day (SCb). Both components include the transport of tubulin (13Williamson T.L. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Using a stable isotope-mass spectrometric technique, we measured the in vivo rate of transport of endogenously 2H-labeled tubulin in sciatic nerves of SOD1G93A mice (Fig. 1). Tubulin is synthesized in the cell body and transported along the axon. To include all forms of transport, whether as individual dimers, oligomers, or polymers (7Baas P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 605-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we measured the kinetics of label incorporation into combined soluble tubulin dimers and polymers in serial anatomical segments of the sciatic nerve. An intraperitoneal bolus of 30–35 ml/kg 2H2O (99.9 mol% 2H2O) was administered to 10-week-old wild-type (WT) and SOD1G93A transgenic mice, resulting in 4–5% body water 2H enrichment that washed out over the next 4–5 days (26Busch R. Kim Y.K. Neese R.A. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. Awada M. Gardner J. Beysen C. Marino M.M. Misell M.L. Hellerstein M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). At 21 days post-labeling (13 weeks of age), the L5 roots and sciatic nerves were removed and cut into 2-mm segments (Fig. 1A). The soluble tubulin dimer and microtubule polymer fractions (Fig. 1B) were separated by centrifugation and combined for analysis by GC/MS for 2H isotope enrichment of tubulin-bound amino acids (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49940-49947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Busch R. Kim Y.K. Neese R.A. Schade-Serin V. Collins M. Awada M. Gardner J. Beysen C. Marino M.M. Misell M.L. Hellerstein M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After 21 days, 2H-labeled tubulin had advanced well along the nerve of WT mice, revealing a clear dual wave pattern (Fig. 1A). The SCa fraction moved at ∼0.3 mm per day, and the SCb fraction moved at ∼0.7 mm per day, similar to published values (13Williamson T.L. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In the WT mice, slightly more labeled tubulin was present in the SCa fraction at 3 weeks after label exposure. Similar analysis in SOD1G93A mice revealed accumulation of 2H labeled tubulin in the L5 root, hillock, and proximal region of axons with a marked retardation and a decreased fraction of tubulin present in SCb (Fig. 1A). Minor differences were also observed in the portion of tubulin that moved in the SCa fraction. To test whether alterations in microtubule dynamics underlies impaired axonal transport 2H2O (8%) in drinking water was administered to WT and SOD1G93A transgenic mice and microtubule polymerization/depolymerization (dynamics) rates were measured as described previously (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49940-49947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 2H2O administration was begun at 8.5, 11, 12.5, and 16 weeks of age, and animals were sacrificed after 48 h of labeling. The lumbar region of the spinal cord (between L2 and L5 levels) and the whole length of both sciatic nerves were dissected and carefully removed. Cytosolic extracts were fractionated to isolate free tubulin dimers and microtubule polymers (Fig. 1B). After separation, microtubule polymers (MTs) were further isolated as dendritic (i.e. MAP2-associated MTs) and dynamic axonal MTs (i.e. Tau-associated MTs) by making use of the compartment-specific distribution of the neuronal MAPs Tau and MAP2 (28Pirollet F. Derancourt J. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8849-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 29Kwei S.L. Clement A. Faissner A. Brandt R.

Hundelt M. Shahani N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This was achieved by sequential binding to immunoaffinity TAU5 and MAP2 columns, leaving all other microtubules in the unbound fraction (Fig. 1B and see supplemental “Methods”). It should be noted that TAU5 and MAP2 antibodies recognize their antigens independently of phosphorylation state and variable exons of MTs, thereby binding to all isoforms (29Kwei S.L. Clement A. Faissner A. Brandt R. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 32Brandt R. Hundelt M. Shahani N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1739: 331-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The vast majority of MAP2 and Tau-non-associated fractions are the cold-stable (CS) microtubules (28Pirollet F. Derancourt J. Haiech J. Job D. Margolis R.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8849-8855Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Inglefield J.R. Mundy W.R. Meacham C.A. Shafer T.J. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Slaughter T. Black M.M. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As judged by Western blotting, Tau-associated MTs were quantitatively captured by the TAU5 affinity column (see supplemental Fig. 6A, lane 3). MAP2-associated MTs were found in the flow-through (see supplemental Fig. 6A, lane 2), confirming the specificity of the affinity separation and indicating that microtubules associated with both MAPs were rare or absent. Tubulin was purified from each fraction to ≥95% purity as determined by SDS-PAGE (see supplemental Fig. 6B). Altered dynamics of Tau-associated and CS MTs was detected in SOD1G93A mice as early as 8.5 weeks of age (presymptomatic), and MT dynamics increased as the mice approached disease onset and began to show symptoms (Fig. 1C). The CS MTs (enriched for axonal shaft) isolated from sciatic nerve of WT mice were the least dynamic population and remained so in older WT mice. In contrast, CS MTs from sciatic nerve of SOD1G93A mice were strikingly more dynamic at 8.5 weeks, which increased with age. The total content of Tau-associated and CS MTs in sciatic nerve of SOD1G93A mice was indistinguishable from WT littermates, indicating that greater label incorporation in MT represented true turnover rather than net assembly (de novo formation) of MT (see supplemental Fig. 7A). A similar degree of hyperdynamicity was observed in all the populations of MTs isolated from sciatic nerve, cerebral cortex, and lumbar region of the spinal cord of symptomatic (13 weeks old) SOD1G93A mice (Fig. 2A). Cortical neurons as well as the lumbar spinal cord neurons showed particularly increased turnover of CS MTs. This increase was ∼5-fold in the cerebral cortex and the lumbar region of the spinal cord and over 8-fold in sciatic nerve, compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A). With the exception of Tau-MTs from the cerebral cortex and MAP2-MTs from the cervical region of the spinal cord, all the other Tau- and MAP2-associated MTs showed higher dynamicity in G93ASOD1 mice at the symptomatic age of 13 weeks compared with WT mice (Fig. 2A). Thus, the spatial distribution of MT hyperdynamicity corresponds to established areas of neuronal degeneration in symptomatic SOD1G93A mice, which exhibit acute axonal pathology along the corticospinal tract and sciatic nerve (4Gurney M.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1721-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Wong P.C. Pardo C.A. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1105-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Importantly, label incorporation measured in the different MT subsets does not reflect exchange with tubulin dimers in vitro during extraction and purification. No label incorporation into Tau- or MAP2-associated MTs was detected when purified 2H-labeled tubulin dimers were added to unlabeled spinal cord extracts (see supplemental Fig. 7B). 2H incorporation into MTs therefore represents in vivo incorporation of labeled tubulin dimers that were newly synthesized during the period of 2H2O exposure (17Fanara P. Turner S. Busch R. Killion S. Awada M. Turner H. Mahsut A. Laprade K.L. Stark J.M. Hellerstein M.K. J. Biol.

Misell M.L. Hellerstein M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 730-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because the sciatic nerve contains both motor and sensory fibers, we compared MT dynamics in a motor nerve (rectus femoris muscle) and a sensory nerve (saphenous nerve) (Fig. 2B). After 48 h of 2H2O labeling, the Tau-associated and CS MTs from the motor nerve were extremely hyperdynamic in symptomatic SOD1G93A mice (13 weeks), whereas no perturbation was observed in the same MT populations from the sensory nerve (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results reveal the presence of markedly hyperdynamic MT subpopulations in the peripheral motor and sciatic mixed nerves, in the cerebral cortex, and in the lumbar region of the spinal cord, but not in sensory nerves, of SOD1G93A mice. Furthermore, hyperdynamicity of MTs occurs early in disease progression and correlates with impaired axonal transport of nutrients. Stabilization of Hyperdynamic Microtubules Delays Disease Onset and Increases Survival—Perturbation of MT dynamics appears to be an early event in motoneuron degeneration in SOD1G93A mice. Based on these findings, we determined whether pharmacologic modulation of MT dynamics prevents neuronal dysfunction and results in clinical benefits. We first examined the effect on MT dynamics of a specific MTMA, noscapine (33Landen J.W. Lang R. McMahon S.J. Rusan N.M. Yvon A.M. Adams A.W. Sorcinelli M.D. Campbell R. Bonaccorsi P. Ansel J.C.

Neurol. 2005; 191: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All drugs were administered to symptomatic SOD1G93A mice beginning at 10 weeks of age. Treatment was for 3 weeks, and 2H2O (8%) was administered during the last 2 days of treatment. The lumbar region of the spinal cord and the entire length of both sciatic nerves were dissected and removed. As shown in Fig. 3A, both MTMA and Pio decreased but did not normalize MT dynamics, whereas riluzole did not have significant general effects but modulated only the Tau- and MAP2-associated MTs in the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Next, we investigated whether co-administration of MTMA/riluzole or MTMA/Pio would further reduce hyperdynamicity of MTs (Fig. 3B). The same treatment and labeling protocol was used, with combination drug therapy started at 10 weeks. Bo"

We hypothesize that hookworms actively manipulate the host immune response through the production of specific molecules designed to facilitate infection by larval stages and adult worm survival within the intestine.

Elucidation of the three-dimensional crystal structure of recombinant AceMIF (rAceMIF) revealed an overall structural homology with significant differences in the tautomerase sites of the human and hookworm proteins. The relative bioactivities of human and hookworm MIF proteins were compared using in vitro assays of tautomerase activity, macrophage migration, and binding to MIF receptor CD74. The activity of rAceMIF was not inhibited by the ligand ISO-1, which was previously determined to be an inhibitor of the catalytic site of human MIF. These data define unique immunological, structural, and functional characteristics of AceMIF, thereby establishing the potential for selectively inhibiting the hookworm cytokine as a means of reducing parasite survival and disease pathogenesis.

Hookworms are bloodfeeding intestinal nematodes that currently infect more than 700 million people in developing countries (1de Silva N.R. Brooker S. Hotez P.J. Montresor A. Engels D. Savioli L. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 547-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). The hookworm life cycle begins when eggs excreted in the feces of an infected individual hatch in soil and undergo successive molts to the infectious L3 stage. After contacting the skin of a permissive host, larvae migrate to the pulmonary vasculature, traverse alveolar capillaries, ascend the respiratory tree and are swallowed. Hookworms molt to the adult stage in the intestine, where they attach to the mucosal surface and feed on blood and tissue. Chronic blood and serum protein loss attributable to hookworm infection is associated with anemia, malnutrition, and growth/developmental delay, resulting in the loss of tens of millions of disability adjusted life-years annually (2Stephenson L.S. Latham M.C. Ottesen E.A. Parasitology. 2000; 121 (,(suppl.), -S38): S23Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is no clear evidence of sterile immunity in humans following naturally acquired infection, suggesting that hookworms may modulate the host immune response, perhaps during tissue migration, and/or while attached to the intestinal mucosa. The fact that adult hookworms can survive within a single human host for many years (3Beaver P.C. Am J. Trop Med. Hyg. 1988; 39: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) further suggests that these worms are capable of evading or dampening host immune responses that might kill parasites and/or trigger expulsion. Of the immunomodulatory activities that have been identified from the hookworms Ancylostoma or Necator, none has yet been shown to play a definitive role in the pathogenesis of infection or intestinal disease (4Moyle M.

Bucala R. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mammalian MIF inhibits the random migration of macrophages and can act as a counterregulator of the immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects of endogenous glucocorticoids (9Aeberli D. Leech M. Morand E.F. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2006; 45: 937-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MIF promotes cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12) production by macrophages, triggers proliferation of T cells, and induces the release of nitric oxide, matrix metalloproteases, COX-2, and prostaglandin E2 (10Sampey A.V.

The molecular mechanism of action of MIF involves sustained activation of the ERK-1/2 family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which leads to increased levels of phospholipase A2 and arachidonic acid, the precursors of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes (13Shi X.

We report here the molecular cloning of a cDNA corresponding to an orthologue of MIF that is secreted by host-dwelling stages of the hookworm parasite Ancylostoma ceylanicum. In vitro characterization confirms that the recombinant A. ceylanicum MIF (rAceMIF) is an active tautomerase and lymphocyte chemoattractant, similar to the human orthologue. Unlike human MIF, however, AceMIF is not inhibited by the small molecule ligand ISO-1, and the three-dimensional crystal structure reveals functionally relevant differences between the hookworm and human proteins. Together, these data establish a structural basis for the development of pathogen-specific MIF inhibitors as potential treatments for infectious diseases, including hookworm. Parasites—The life cycle of A. ceylanicum was maintained in Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) (22Bungiro Jr., R.D. Greene J. Kruglov E. Cappello M. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 183: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) under protocols approved by the Yale Animal Care and Use committee. Soluble hookworm protein extracts (HEX) were prepared from A. ceylanicum by grinding adult worms in a tissue homogenizer, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Protein preparations of eggs/first stage (L1) A. ceylanicum larvae, third stage (L3) larvae and adult hookworm excretory/secretory (ES) proteins were prepared as described (23Brown A.C. Harrison L.M.

Kuzmic P. Cappello M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29391-29399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cloning of the AceMIF cDNA—A partial sequence of the Ace-MIF gene was initially identified in the A. ceylanicum EST data base available through the Nematode EST project (25Wylie T. Martin J.C. Dante M. Mitreva M.D. Clifton S.W. Chinwalla A. Waterston R.H. Wilson R.K. McCarter J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (-D426): D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 451-bp EST sequence (GenBank™ accession no. BM131124) corresponds to a 98-amino acid fragment of the mature Ace-MIF protein. To clone the cDNA corresponding to the AceMIF gene, A. ceylanicum RNA was extracted from adult worms in the presence of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was prepared with oligo(dT) primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase as previously described (24Milstone A.M. Harrison L.M. Bungiro R.D. Kuzmic P. Cappello M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29391-29399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The full-length AceMIF cDNA was subsequently amplified from adult A. ceylanicum cDNA by RT-PCR using a gene-specific 3′-primer and a 5′-primer corresponding to the nematode spliced leader sequence (SL-1) (26Bungiro Jr., R.D. Solis C.V. Harrison L.M. Cappello M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alignment of the various MIF clones was conducted using MegAlign software from DNASTAR, Inc. and BLAST analysis was conducted using the NCBI BLAST utility. Expression and Purification of Recombinant AceMIF—The cDNA corresponding to the mature AceMIF protein was directionally cloned into the pET11b expression plasmid vector as described (27Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed by transforming Escherichia coli BL21-Gold (DE3) competent cells, and individual colonies containing the rAceMIF cDNA were identified through screening by PCR. Expression of recombinant AceMIF protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galacto-pyranoside to a culture of E. coli containing the expression plasmid, followed by shaking at 37 °C for 3 h. The rAceMIF protein was purified from soluble cell lysates using sequential anion exchange, cation exchange, and size exclusion chromatography following procedures described previously for mammalian MIF (27Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA kit (Pierce), and the mass of the purified rAceMIF was determined using electrospray mass spectrometry as described (26Bungiro Jr., R.D. Solis C.V. Harrison L.M. Cappello M. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Generation of a Polyclonal α-AceMIF IgG and Immunodetection of AceMIF Protein—A single New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with 700 μg of rAceMIF in Freund’s Complete adjuvant. The rabbit was subsequently boosted twice at 3-week intervals with 700 μg of protein in Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Serum was collected after the third vaccination, and the IgG purified using affinity chromatography (26Bungiro Jr., R.D. Solis C.V. Harrison L.M. Cappello M. Infect.

Parasitol. 2003; 129: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The presence of native AceMIF in soluble protein extracts of A. ceylanicum eggs/L1 larvae, L3 larvae, adult worms, as well as pooled adult worm ES proteins was assessed by immunoblot (23Brown A.C. Harrison L.M. Kapulkin W. Jones B.F. Sinha A. Savage A. Villalon N. Cappello M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2007; 151: 141Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes containing various native hookworm protein preparations were probed with the rabbit α-rAceMIF IgG, followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat α-rabbit IgG and chemiluminescent detection. A similar method was used to perform immunoblots of rAceMIF and recombinant human MIF (rhMIF) using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human protein (29Donnelly S.C. Haslett C. Reid P.T. Grant I.S. Wallace W.A. Metz C.N. Bruce L.J. Bucala R. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 320-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). X-ray Crystal Structure of rAceMIF—For crystallographic studies, rAceMIF was expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells transformed with the pET-11b expression vector containing the AceMIF cDNA and purified using anion and cation exchange chromatography as described above. Se-methionine containing rAceMIF was prepared for multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) phasing according to a previously reported method (30Sun H.W. Swope M. Cinquina C. Bedarkar S. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The rAceMIF was initially crystallized in 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate pH 5.6, and 0.2 m potassium sodium tartrate (Crystal Screen2 14 from Hampton Research) at 20 °C using the hanging drop method. Se-methionine rAceMIF was crystallized in 4% of isopropyl alcohol and 2.2–2.3 m ammonium sulfate. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the X29 beam line in Brookhaven National Laboratory. All crystals were soaked in 20% glycerol in the crystallization solution for cryo-protection under liquid nitrogen during data collection. Native crystal diffraction data were collected at 1.1 Å by 1° oscillation for 180°. Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled using HKL2000 (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The space group was confirmed by examining images of the processed data in reciprocal space using HKLVIEW (31Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). Crystallographic statistics for data collection, processing, and refinement are summarized in Table 1. Selenium sites and phases were determined using ShelxD and E (32Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) via HKL2MAP (33Pape T. Schneider T.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 843-844Crossref Google Scholar). Model building was initiated by Arp-Warp (34Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

In Vitro Characterization of rAceMIF Activity—Tautomerase activity was assessed using the substrate p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) prepared as described (42Lin E.C. Pitt B.M. Civen M. Knox W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 668-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate and buffer were mixed in 96-well plates, followed by addition of purified protein (rAceMIF or rhMIF). Tautomerase activity was determined by measuring the increase in absorbance at 306 nm (A306) over 30–90 s. The inhibitory effect of ISO-1 (Calbiochem) (43Al-Abed Y. Dabideen D. Aljabari B. Valster A.

The raw data were processed using Prism4 from GraphPad to obtain the kinetic parameters. The molar extinction coefficient of the enol form of HPP (ɛ = 11,400 m-1) was determined experimentally (42Lin E.C. Pitt B.M. Civen M. Knox W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 668-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chemoattractant activities of rAceMIF and rhMIF were measured using human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) isolated from whole blood by centrifugation on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma) (45Tan T.H. Edgerton S.A. Kumari R. McAlister M.S. Roe S.M. Nagl S. Pearl L.H. Selkirk M.E. Bianco A.E. Totty N.F. Engwerda C. Gray C.A. Meyer D.J. Rowe S.M. Biochem.

These assays were carried out in 24-well tissue culture plates utilizing 8.0-μm cell culture inserts (Falcon). Washed cells were placed in the cell culture insert with or without recombinant MIF, followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Experiments were also carried out by incubating PMBCs with recombinant MIF proteins (AceMIF or hMIF) in the presence of ISO-1. Cells that migrated through the membrane were fixed in methanol and stained with Geimsa, followed by counting under light microscopy. Results are expressed as the mean number of cells counted per high power field for each of two replicates ± S.E. Analysis of Binding of rAceMIF to CD74—Binding to the MIF receptor (CD74) was characterized by coating wells of a 96-well plate with recombinant, soluble CD74 ectodomain (sCD7473–232) as described (47Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Biotinylated human MIF (2 ng/μl) (Roche Applied Sciences) was added together in triplicate wells with increasing concentrations of purified (non-biotinylated) recombinant human MIF (rhMIF) (27Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), heat-denatured rhMIF, rAceMIF, heat-denatured rAceMIF, or a neutralizing, α-CD74 monoclonal antibody (clone LN2) (47Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The bound biotinylated rhMIF was detected by adding streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (R&D), followed by detection of the alkaline phosphatase with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Absorbance at 405 nm was plotted as percent A405 relative to wells containing biotinylated human MIF alone. Each plot represents at least three independently performed assays, and each data point depicts a S.E. ≤10%. The real time binding interaction of rAceMIF with CD74 was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 optical biosensor (BIAcore AB, Sweden) (47Leng L. Metz C.N. Fang Y. Xu J. Donnelly S. Baugh J. Delohery T. Chen Y. Mitchell R.A. Bucala R. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The CM5 sensor chips and the BIA Evaluation software were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The MIF receptor (sCD7473–232) was immobilized according to a standardized method using the Biacore Amine Coupling Kit. The immobilized CM5 chips were equilibrated in HEPES (pH 8.0) at 20 μl/min, and the ligand (rAceMIF) was introduced at five serial dilutions in BIAcore buffer (1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Binding was measured at 25 °C for 5 min, followed by 15 min of dissociation. After regeneration with 1 m NaCl/50 mm NaOH, the process was repeated 3 times for each dilution sample. Sensorgram response data were analyzed in the BIA evaluation kinetics package and the equilibrium binding constants calculated. Cloning and Expression of the Ace-MIF cDNA—A partial nucleotide sequence with homology to human and nematode MIF genes was identified from the adult A. ceylanicum EST data base (GenBank accession no. BM131124) (25Wylie T. Martin J.C. Dante M. Mitreva M.D. Clifton S.W. Chinwalla A. Waterston R.H. Wilson R.K. McCarter J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (-D426): D423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A full-length AceMIF cDNA was subsequently amplified from adult A. ceylanicum cDNA by RT-PCR using a 5′-primer corresponding to the nematode spliced leader (SL-1) (28Del Valle A. Jones B.F. Harrison L.M. Chadderdon R.C. Cappello M. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 129: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 48Bungiro R.D. Harrison L.M. Cappello M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and a 3′-primer that was derived from the original EST sequence. The translated amino acid sequence predicted by the AceMIF cDNA corresponds to a mature protein that is 119 amino acids in length, with a predicted mass of 12,993 Da and pI of 7.92. Similar to other MIF orthologues (49Flieger O. Engling A. Bucala R. Lue H. Nickel W. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 551: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), the AceMIF cDNA contained no secretory signal sequence following the initiating methionine codon. Analysis of the translated amino acid sequence of AceMIF reveals that the hookworm protein shares between 28–35% sequence identity and 53–63% similarity with MIF orthologues from other parasitic nematodes (Fig. 1A). Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences from nine parasitic nematode MIF proteins indicates that there are 40 highly conserved amino acids, including 17 that are invariant among all nine sequences. By comparison, AceMIF is 33% identical and 53% similar to the human MIF amino acid sequence (GenBank™ accession no. AAP36881) (Fig. 1B). The cDNA corresponding to the mature AceMIF coding sequence was expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously for mammalian MIF (27Bernhagen J. Mitchell R.A. Calandra T. Voelter W. Cerami A. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14144-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Analysis of the purified rAceMIF protein using electrospray mass spectrometry (48Bungiro R.D. Harrison L.M. Cappello M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) revealed a mass of 12,996 Da (data not shown), which is within 0.02% of the predicted mass of the translated amino acid sequence (12,993 Da). Stage-specific Expression of rAceMIF and Comparison of Immunoreactivity with Human MIF—Probing of immunoblots with the α-rAceMIF IgG revealed recognition of a single protein band at a mass of ∼13 kDa present in soluble protein extracts of adult male, female, and L3 A. ceylanicum worm (Fig. 2). In contrast, no signal was observed in the soluble protein preparation of eggs and newly hatched (L1) larvae, suggesting that the translation of AceMIF protein is developmentally regulated in vivo, with expression initiated between the L1 and L3 stage. Immunoblots of pooled adult worm ES proteins identified a protein doublet, with the higher MW species at the estimated size of the full-length AceMIF (12,993 Da), and a smaller species likely representing a breakdown product. The immunoblot data suggest that the native protein does not undergo significant post-translational modification, given the close approximate size of the protein band compared with the predicted size of AceMIF. To determine whether there are any cross reacting epitopes shared by the recombinant human MIF (rhMIF) and rAceMIF proteins, immunoblot experiments were carried out using specific antisera (Fig. 2B). The α-rhMIF IgG only recognizes the human protein, while the α-rAceMIF IgG recognizes only the hookworm recombinant, confirming that the epitope recognized by the α-rhMIF is not present in the hookworm protein. Moreover, the fact that the polyclonal α-rAceMIF IgG does not recognize the human homologue, despite 33% amino acid sequence identity and 53% similarity, suggests that the two recombinants share few immunoreactive epitopes. In control blots, preimmune IgG did not react with either protein (not shown). Three-dimensional Crystal Structure of rAceMIF and Analysis of the Active Site—The structure of rAceMIF, as defined by the crystallography data (Table 1), consists of four protomers in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3). Three of the protomers form a trimer, and the last monomer forms a trimer with two other protomers from adjacent asymmetric units. As expected, the topology is very similar to human MIF (Fig. 3). However, despite the backbone similarity, the protein surface and electrostatic potential of AceMIF are distinct (Fig. 4A). Also, the interface between subunits of the AceMIF trimer is highly charged compared with human MIF (Fig. 4B), making it unlikely that the two MIF molecules form heterotrimers in solution.FIGURE 4Electrostatic surface potential of AceMIF and hMIF.

Recombinant CysK1 is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of O-acetylserine to cysteine. The crystal structure of the enzyme was determined to 1.8Å resolution. CysK1 belongs to the family of fold type II PLP enzymes and is similar in structure to other O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases. We were able to trap the α-aminoacrylate reaction intermediate and determine its structure by cryocrystallography. Formation of the aminoacrylate complex is accompanied by a domain rotation resulting in active site closure. The aminoacrylate moiety is bound in the active site via the covalent linkage to the PLP cofactor and by hydrogen bonds of its carboxyl group to several enzyme residues. The catalytic lysine residue is positioned such that it can protonate the Cα-carbon atom of the aminoacrylate only from the si-face, resulting in the formation of l-cysteine. CysK1 is competitively inhibited by a four-residue peptide derived from the C-terminal of serine acetyl transferase. The crystallographic analysis reveals that the peptide binds to the enzyme active site, suggesting that CysK1 forms an bi-enzyme complex with serine acetyl transferase, in a similar manner to other bacterial and plant O-acetylserine sulfhydrylases.

Gene expression and proteome analysis of various models of dormancy in Mycobacterium tuberculosis have shown that the genes involved in sulfate transport (1Wooff E. Michell S.L. Gordon S.V.

Nature. 2000; 406: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar), where it is exposed to oxidative stress and reactive nitrogen intermediates as a cellular response to pathogen invasion, leading to oxidation and S-nitrosylation of cysteine residues (8Rhee K.Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Bacteria in the group designated as Actinomycetales, including mycobacteria, produce mycothiol (1-d-myo-inosityl-2-(N-acetyl-cysteinyl) amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside) as their principal low molecular-mass thiol, which plays the role of glutathione and contains a cysteine moiety (9Bornemann C. Jardine M.A. Spies H.S. Steenkamp D.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Thereby the first defense line in oxidative stress is directly linked to the availability of cysteine. Inhibition of cysteine biosynthesis therefore appears to be an attractive route to novel antibacterials that may also be active against persistent M. tuberculosis. In plants, some archaea, and most eubacteria, the de novo biosynthesis of l-cysteine starts from serine and involves two enzymes. Serine acetyl transferase (SAT, 3The abbreviations used are: SAT, serine acetyl transferase; OAS, O-acetyl-l-serine; OASS, O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentane-diol; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Bis-Tris, 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. EC 2.3.1.30), also denoted CysE, catalyzes the formation of O-acetylserine (OAS) from acetyl-CoA and serine. This metabolite is then converted to cysteine through the elimination of acetate and addition of hydrogen sulfide by the enzyme O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS, EC 2.5.1.47) (for recent reviews, see Refs. 10Tai C-H. Cook P.F. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and 11Rabeh W.M. Cook P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26803-26806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The sulfur source is supplied by the sulfate reduction (APS/PAPS) pathway. In most bacteria, pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent OASS is found as two isoenzymes, OASS-A (also denoted CysK) and OASS-B (denoted CysM). These isoenzymes show 25–45% identity in amino acid sequence but exhibit characteristic differences in their substrate specificity with respect to the sulfur donor. CysK uses hydrogen sulfide as sulfur source, whereas the characterized CysM proteins tend to accept thiosulphate and larger substrates as sulfur source (12Nakamura T. Iwahashi H. Eguchi Y. J.

The genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv encodes three genes that were annotated as OASS (the TubercuList World-Wide Web Server). CysK1 (Rv2334) is homologous to OASS-A, and CysM (Rv1336) is homologous to OASS-B. The third isoenzyme, encoded by Rv0848, shows similarities to the other two enzymes to the same extent and is therefore designated as either CysK2 or CysM2. The crystal structure analysis of OASS from Salmonella typhimurium (14Burkhard P. Rao G.S. Hohenester E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol.

Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8 (-R6): R1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The enzymatic mechanism of OASS follows a ping-pong mechanism typical for PLP-dependent enzymes (10Tai C-H. Cook P.F. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Rabeh W.M. Cook P.F. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reaction can be divided into two halves (Scheme 1). In the resting state, the cofactor forms an internal Schiff base with the invariant catalytic lysine residue (compound I in Scheme 1). The incoming substrate then forms an external Schiff base with PLP (II) followed by a β-elimination in which acetate is released and a proton is abstracted from the α position, most likely by the lysine side chain (21Rege V.D. Kredich N.M. Tai C.H. Karsten W.E. Schnackerz K.D. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13485-13493Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A similar role of the invariant lysine residue has been proven in the homologous tryptophan synthase β-subunit (22Lu Z. Nagata S. McPhie P. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8727-8743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The product of the first half-reaction is the α-aminoacrylate intermediate (23Schnackerz K.D. Ehrlich J.H. Giesemann W. Reed T.A. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3557-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), covalently linked to PLP (III). The second half-reaction starts with a nucleophilic attack of the sulfide (or HS-) on the β-carbon of the aminoacrylate intermediate, and the α-carbon is reprotonated (20Rabeh W.M. Alguindigue S.S. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Tai C.H. Nalabolu S.R. Simmons J.W. II I Jacobson T.M. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12311-12322Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), resulting in cysteine bound as external Schiff base (IV). Finally, the product is released via regeneration of the internal aldimine. Formation of the external aldimine appears to be coupled to a large conformational change that leads to the closure of the active site, as suggested by the structure of the S. typhimurium CysK K41A mutant in complex with methionine, a substrate analogue (25Burkhard P. Tai C.H. Ristroph C.M. Cook P.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 941-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, in the corresponding structure of OASS from A. thaliana, the enzyme also remained in the open conformation after formation of the covalent PLP-methionine adduct (17Bonner E.R. Cahoon R.E. Knapke S.M. Jez J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38803-38813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The latter is assumed to mimic the external aldimine (II). In this work, we describe the cloning, purification, characterization, and 1.8 Å x-ray structure of CysK1 from M. tuberculosis. We were also able to trap the α-aminoacrylate in the crystal and report the structure of this reaction intermediate to 2.2 Å resolution, thus providing novel structural insights in the reaction cycle of CysK1. We also determined the crystal structure of CysK1 from M. tuberculosis bound to an inhibitory four-residue peptide derived from the C terminus of M. tuberculosis CysE (SAT, Rv2335). The structure of this inhibited form of CysK1 may provide the basis for the design of strong binding inhibitors of this enzyme. Gene Cloning and Protein Production—The DNA sequence coding for CysK1 from M. tuberculosis (Rv2334) was amplified by PCR and cloned using upstream NdeI and downstream HindIII restriction sites. Subsequently, the sequence was verified, and the fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET28a (Novagen), resulting in a cleavable six-histidine tag at the N terminus of the polypeptide chain. In this construct, thrombin cleavage results in a recombinant protein with three additional amino acids (Gly-Ser-His) at the N terminus. E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the expression construct pET-His6CysK1 was cultivated in 1.5 liters of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (30 μg/ml) at 21 °C. At an A600 value of 0.5–0.6, gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After ∼24 h, the cells were harvested and then resuspended in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted by freeze-thaw cycles, lysozyme, and DNase I treatment and sonication. The clarified lysates were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) with a column volume of 1.8 ml. After extensive washing with 10 mm imidazole, remaining proteins were eluted with an imidazole step gradient. Pure His6-CysK1 eluted in fractions containing 100–200 mm imidazole. His6-CysK1-containing fractions were pooled, loaded on a desalting PD10 column (GE-Healthcare), and eluted in a buffer of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage. Residual non-cleaved His-CysK1 was removed by passage through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The flow-through containing the cleaved CysK1 protein was further purified using an ion-exchange step on a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) column and NaCl gradient elution. The CysK1-containing fractions (200–250 mm NaCl) were pooled and loaded on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl. This procedure resulted in homogeneous CysK1 as verified by SDS chromatography. CysK1 protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using an Amicon centrifugation device with a 3-kDa molecular mass cut-off. Aliquots of the protein preparations were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until further use. Spectrophotometry—UV-visible absorbance spectra of CysK1 were recorded at a concentration of 3.3 mg/ml using a Jasco-V65 spectrophotometer. Spectra of the covalent amino-acrylate complex were obtained after the addition of 300 μm O-acetylserine to the enzyme solution. Enzyme Activity—Recombinant CysK1 was assayed for O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase activity spectrophotometrically at 560 nm by monitoring the formation of cysteine using the acid-ninhydrin method (26Gaitonde M.K. Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out in 1500 μl of 100 mm MOPS buffer at pH 7.0. O-Acetyl-l-serine and sodium sulfide (dissolved in 1 mm NaOH) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 0.25 mm, respectively, and the reactions were started by the addition of the enzyme (0.025 μg) to the assay mixtures. Aliquots of 250 μl were taken at various time points, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 16.6%). Following centrifugation, the amount of product was determined spectrophotometrically using a standard curve for cysteine in the range 0.04–0.8 mm. Specific activities were derived from the linear part of the time curves, and each measurement was carried out in triplicate at 30 and 37 °C, respectively. Peptide Binding Assay and Inhibition Studies—The chemically synthesized oligopeptide DFSI was obtained from the GenScript Corp., Scotch Plains, NJ. The binding interaction was probed in a ThermoFluor experiment (27Ericsson U.B. Hallberg B.M. Detitta G.T. Dekker N. Nordlund P. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 357: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar) in the buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl in the presence of the dye Sypro Orange (Sigma). CysK1 at a concentration of 0.4 μg/μl (12 pmol/μl) in a total volume of 25 μl was mixed with the DFSI peptide at concentrations of 0.0016, 0.016, 0.16, and 1.6 mm. Fluorescence at the wavelength 575 nm was recorded in the temperature interval 20–90 °C. The initial rate of cysteine formation by CysK1 was determined at 22 °C in the absence and presence of various DFSI peptide concentrations, and varying the OAS concentration in the range 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 8.0, and 10 mm at a constant sodium sulfide concentration of 1.0 mm in 100 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. At various time intervals, aliquots of the reaction mixture were removed and assayed for l-cysteine formation as described above. The mode of inhibition was determined from double reciprocal plots, and the KI value for the peptide was derived using the formalism described in (28Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. 2004; (, Portland Press Ltd., London, UK)Google Scholar). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystallization screening was carried out using the vapor diffusion method and a Phoenix crystallization robot. After extensive screening and optimization, two conditions were established that resulted in single crystals of CysK1. Both contained unusually high 2-methyl-2,4-pentane-diol (MPD) concentrations. Crystal form I was obtained by mixing 3 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (Bis-Tris-propane, pH 7.5, and 60–65% MPD) in sitting drops. The rod-like crystals diffracted, however poorly (∼6 Å), and were not characterized further. Crystal form II was obtained by mixing 2 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml) with 2 μl of reservoir solution (sodium HEPES, pH 7.2–8.2, and 80% MPD) in either sitting or hanging drops. The diamond-shaped single crystals reproducibly diffracted to 1.8–2.0 Å resolution. The CysK1 α-aminoacrylate complex was prepared by a combination of soaking and freeze-trapping. Sitting drops containing CysK1 crystals obtained at pH 8.2 were layered cautiously with a droplet of mother liquor containing the substrate O-acetylserine at concentrations of 1 and 2 mm, respectively. At various time intervals (1 mm OAS concentration after 10, 15, 20, 30, 35, and 30 min; at 2 mm OAS concentration after 10 and 20 min), crystals were removed, flash-frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen until x-ray analysis. Due to the high MPD concentration in the mother liquor, no cryoprotectant was necessary. Co-crystallization of CysK1 with the DFSI-peptide was achieved using the crystallization conditions established for the holoenzyme. CysK1 at a concentration of 10 mg/ml was mixed with the peptide at various peptide concentrations (0.1, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 10.0 mm) and preincubated at 22° for 30–60 min before setting up the crystallization drops using the conditions described above. Diffraction data for crystals of the holoenzyme were collected at beamline ID14:3 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). Diffraction data for the peptide complex were collected at the beamline ID14:1 of the ESRF. Diffraction data sets for the CysK1-aminoacrylate complexes were collected at beamline 9/11 at MAX-lab (Lund, Sweden). All data sets were collected in a nitrogen gas stream at 110 K. The x-ray data were processed and scaled with the programs MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The native crystals belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 with cell dimensions a = b = 71.0 Å and c = 179.6 Å. Soaking of the crystals with OAS resulted in a minor change of cell parameters to a = b = 71.7 Å and c = 181.0 Å. The co-crystallization of CysK1 with the DFSI peptide resulted in crystals with cell dimensions a = b = 72.45 and c = 178.93.

Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4175) Google Scholar). The coordinates for OASS from A. thaliana (17Bonner E.R. Cahoon R.E. Knapke S.M. Jez J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38803-38813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 1Z7W) with the cofactor PLP and the bound sulfate ion omitted were used as the search model. The best solution had a score of 0.435 and an R-factor of 48.3%, with a single monomer in the asymmetric unit. To monitor the behavior of the refinement process, 5% of the x-ray data were removed for the calculation of R-free. Initial cycles of restrained refinement using Refmac5 (31Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) resulted in a drop of the R-factor by 12.8%. The correctness of the molecular replacement solution was confirmed by electron density for the cofactor, including the covalent linkage to the active site lysine residue appearing at the expected positions. Manual rebuilding of the model was carried out with the program Coot (32Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) based on σ-A weighted 2Fo - Fo and Fo - Fo electron density maps (33Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). Manual adjustment of the model was interspersed with rounds of refinement by Refmac5 (31Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Water molecules were added based on peak heights, shape of the electron density, temperature factor, and capability to form hydrogen bonds to surrounding protein residues and/or other water molecules. The final model contains amino acid residues 1–300 from CysK1, one PLP molecule, four MPD molecules, one chloride ion, and 205 water molecules. The last 10 residues at the C terminus did not have defined electron density. Due to the change in cell dimensions upon soaking with OAS, molecular replacement was used to solve the structure of the CysK1 α-aminoacrylate complex. An initial CysK1 model was used as search model. The electron density maps calculated from the data set collected from a crystal soaked in 1 mm OAS for 30 min clearly indicated formation of the α-aminoacrylate intermediate. Refinement of the complex was carried out using a similar protocol as outlined above. At the final stage, TLS refinement (34Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) was used with 20 TLS groups as defined by the TLSMD server (35Painter J. Merritt E.A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2006; 39: 109-111Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar), which resulted in a 2% drop in the free R-factor. The final model contains residues 1–306 from CysK1, the amino-acrylate PLP covalent complex, one MPD, and 47 crystallographic water molecules. The structure of the CysK1-peptide complex was solved by molecular replacement using the initially refined CysK1 structure as a search model. The electron density calculated after the initial refinement rounds indicated the presence of the peptide bound at the enzyme active site. Refinement of the complex was carried out using a similar protocol as outlined above. The final model comprises CysK1 residues 1–300, the four-residue-long peptide, one MPD molecule, and 163 water molecules. The protein models were analyzed with PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar) to monitor the stereochemistry. Details of the refinement and protein models are given in Table 1. Figures were made using the program PyMOL. The sequence alignment was made by ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Characterization of CysK1 from M. tuberculosis—CysK1 was produced with a hexahistidine tag at the N terminus. The tag was removed by thrombin leaving three extra residues Gly-Ser-His on the N terminus of the purified protein. Recombinant CysK1 has a yellow color and shows the typical absorption spectrum of PLP-dependent enzymes (38Karsten W.E. Cook P.F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 354: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The absorbance peak at 410 nm is characteristic of the internal Schiff base formed between the cofactor and the active site lysine residue (Fig. 1). Gel filtration chromatography suggested that CysK1 is a dimer in solution and that the enzyme migrated in a native gel as a single well defined band (data not shown). Purified recombinant CysK1 is catalytically active as an O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase. The specific activity was determined with O-acetyl-l-serine and sodium sulfide as substrates. The turnover number was 211 s-1 at 30 °C and 352 s-1 at 37 °C. These values compare well with those determined for the related enzyme from S. typhimurium, which showed 280 s-1 at 25 °C as turnover rate for the reaction (39Hwang C.C Woehl E.U. Minter D.E. Dunn M.F. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6358-6365Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Overall Structure of M. tuberculosis CysK1—The asymmetric unit contains a single copy of the CysK1 subunit, corresponding to a solvent content of 65%. The subunit consists of two domains, each having a α/β-fold (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1), typical of the fold type II PLP enzymes (18Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1291-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 19Schneider G. Kaöck H. Lindqvist Y. Structure (Lond.). 2000; 8 (-R6): R1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain (residues 43–145) is built up by a central four-stranded parallel β-sheet, which is flanked by three α-helices on one side and one α-helix on the other side. The C-terminal domain consists of residues 11–42 and 151–304 that fold into a six-stranded mixed β-sheet sandwiched by four α-helices. In the crystal, the enzyme is a dimer, with the molecular axis coinciding with the 2-fold crystallographic axis. The buried surface at the dimer interface is 2130 Å2, which corresponds to 15.7% of the total surface of one monomer. CysK1 is related in fold to other PLP enzymes of the fold type II class, i.e. the β-subunit of tryptophan synthase (40Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1995788052,"Mutations in PINK1 cause the mitochondrial-related neurodegenerative disease Parkinson's. Here we investigate whether obesity, type 2 diabetes, or inactivity alters transcription from the PINK1 locus. We utilized a cDNA-array and quantitative real-time PCR for gene expression analysis of muscle from healthy volunteers following physical inactivity, and muscle and adipose tissue from nonobese or obese subjects with normal glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Functional studies of PINK1 were performed utilizing RNA interference in cell culture models. Following inactivity, the PINK1 locus had an opposing regulation pattern (PINK1 was down-regulated while natural antisense PINK1 was up-regulated). In type 2 diabetes skeletal muscle, all transcripts from the PINK1 locus were suppressed and gene expression correlated with diabetes status. RNA interference of PINK1 in human neuronal cell lines impaired basal glucose uptake. In adipose tissue, mitochondrial gene expression correlated with PINK1 expression although remained unaltered following siRNA knockdown of Pink1 in primary cultures of brown preadipocytes. In conclusion, regulation of the PINK1 locus, previously linked to neurodegenerative disease, is altered in obesity, type 2 diabetes and inactivity, while the combination of RNAi experiments and clinical data suggests a role for PINK1 in cell energetics rather than in mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2098009765,"A growing body of evidence suggests that chromogranin A (CgA), a secretory protein released by many neuroendocrine cells and frequently used as a diagnostic and prognostic serum marker for a range of neuroendocrine tumors, is a precursor of several bioactive fragments. This work was undertaken to assess whether the N-terminal fragment CgA(1-76) (called vasostatin I) can inhibit the proangiogenic activity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a factor involved in tumor growth. The effect of recombinant human vasostatin I (VS-1) on VEGF-induced human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVEC) signaling, proliferation, migration, and organization has been investigated. We have found that VS-1 (3 microg/ml; 330 nM) can inhibit VEGF-induced ERK phosphorylation, as well as cell migration, proliferation, morphogenesis, and invasion of collagen gels in various in vitro assays. In addition, VS-1 could inhibit the formation of capillary-like structures in Matrigel plugs in a rat model. VS-1 could also inhibit basal ERK phosphorylation and motility of HUVEC, leading to a more quiescent state in the absence of VEGF, without inducing apoptotic or necrotic effects.These findings suggest that vasostatin I may play a novel role as a regulator of endothelial cell function and homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2118308841,"Severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by complex precapillary arteriolar lesions, which contain phenotypically altered smooth muscle (SM) and endothelial cells (EC). We have demonstrated that VEGF receptor blockade by SU5416 {3-[(2,4-dimethylpyrrol-5-yl)methylidenyl]-indolin 2-one} in combination with chronic hypoxia causes severe angioproliferative PH associated with arterial occlusion in rats. We postulate that endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation can take place in the occlusive lesions and that endothelium-derived mesenchymal cells can further differentiate toward a SM phenotype. To examine this hypothesis, we incubated human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMVEC) with SU5416 and analyzed these cells utilizing quantitative-PCR, immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometry analysis. In vitro studies in HPMVEC demonstrated that SU5416 suppressed PGI2S gene expression while potently inducing COX-2, VEGF, and TGF-beta1 expression; and caused transdifferentiation of mature vascular endothelial cells (defined by Dil-ac-LDL, Lectin and Factor VIII) to SM-like (as defined by expression of alpha-SM actin) ""transitional"" cells, coexpressing both endothelial and SM markers. SU5416 expanded the number of CD34 and/or c-kit positive cells and caused transdifferentiation of CD34 positive cells but not negative cells. In conclusion, our data show that SU5416 generated a selection pressure that killed some EC and expanded progenitor-like cells to transdifferentiate to SM-like and neuronal-like cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038413365,"Abstract The x-ray crystal structures of five triclosan analogs, in addition to that of the isoniazid-NAD adduct, are described in relation to their integral role in the design of potent inhibitors of the malarial enzyme Plasmodium falciparum enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (PfENR). Many of the novel 5-substituted analogs exhibit low micromolar potency against in vitro cultures of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive strains of the P. falciparum parasite and inhibit purified PfENR enzyme with IC50 values of <200 nm. This study has significantly expanded the knowledge base with regard to the structure-activity relationship of triclosan while affording gains against cultured parasites and purified PfENR enzyme. In contrast to a recent report in the literature, these results demonstrate the ability to improve the in vitro potency of triclosan significantly by replacing the suboptimal 5-chloro group with larger hydrophobic moieties. The biological and x-ray crystallographic data thus demonstrate the flexibility of the active site and point to future rounds of optimization to improve compound potency against purified enzyme and intracellular Plasmodium parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1975825303,"We have previously identified Trp14 as a critical residue that stabilizes the kink in the boomerang structure of the influenza fusion domain and found that cells expressing hemagglutinin with a Trp14 to Ala mutation cannot fuse with red blood cells. However, mutating another aromatic residue, Phe9, on the other side of the kink did not have a significant effect on fusion or the ability of the mutant fusion peptide to bind to or perturb the bilayer structure of lipid model membranes. We reasoned that Phe is not as potent to contribute to the kink as the larger Trp and that the cooperation of Phe9 and Ile10 might be needed to elicit the same effect. Indeed, the double mutant F9A/I10A diminished cell-cell fusion and the ability of the fusion domain to bind to and perturb lipid bilayers in a similar fashion as the W14A mutant. A structure determination of F9A in lipid micelles by solution NMR shows that F9A adopts a similarly kinked structure as wild type. Distances between the two arms of the boomerang structure of wild type, F9A, W14A, and F9A/I10A in lipid bilayers were measured by double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy and showed that the kinks of W14A and F9A/I10A are more flexible than those of wild type and F9A. These results underscore the importance of large hydrophobic residues on both sides of the kink region of the influenza hemagglutinin fusion domain to fix the angle of the boomerang structure and thereby confer fusion function to this critical domain.

Enveloped viruses enter host cells by membrane fusion. Influenza virus, as an example, first attaches to the plasma membrane of the host cell, and the virus is then taken up by the host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Each monomer of the HA homotrimer consists of two subunits, HA1 and HA2. While HA1 is responsible for receptor recognition, HA2, which also anchors HA in the viral membrane, is responsible for membrane fusion. The fusion domain or fusion peptide of HA consists of a relatively hydrophobic sequence located at the N terminus of the HA2 subunit. Under resting condition at neutral pH, the fusion domains are buried in hydrophobic pockets at the interfaces between monomers in the HA trimer. However, under acidic conditions, the fusion domains become exposed and insert into the endosomal target membrane of the host cell, where they initiate fusion. A single fusion site is thought to consist of several HA trimers. Thus, multiple fusion domains are suggested to work cooperatively to merge the two membranes. In addition to these fusion domain-lipid interactions, the pH-induced conformational change also tilts the coiled-coil rods of HA2 relative to the two membranes and thereby drags them into close proximity (1Tatulian S.A. Hinterdorfer P. Baber G. Tamm L.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5514-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Some current models of HA-mediated membrane fusion suggest that there are interactions between the transmembrane and fusion domains and that these interactions may facilitate late steps of membrane fusion (2Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fusion domain of influenza HA consists of ∼24 quite highly conserved residues, of which six are glycines. The sequence is overall quite hydrophobic, but also contains a few polar residues. The structure of the HA fusion domain has been determined by solution NMR spectroscopy in DPC micelles and its disposition and depth of membrane penetration has been determined by site-directed spin-label EPR spectroscopy in lipid bilayers (3Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). At pH 5, the domain adopts a shallow angle boomerang structure, with an α-helix in the N-terminal arm and a short 310-helix in the C-terminal arm. The domain docks into lipid bilayers with the N-terminal and C-terminal arms inserting into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer, while the apex of the kink, Asn12, is located in the hydrophilic head group region of the bilayer. The structure and lipid interaction of the non-fusogenic mutant, W14A, is very different and its location in the bilayer also differs significantly from that of the wild-type structure (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The N-terminal arm lies almost parallel in the interface and the C-terminal arm is very flexible and points out of the membrane without adopting a regular secondary structure. W14A also binds more weakly to model membranes and perturbs the order of lipid bilayers to lesser degree than the wild-type fusion domain. These results suggested that a boomerang structure with a fixed kink angle is important to confer fusion activity to HA. Because Phe9 is on the opposite side of the kink region but still close to the other aromatic residue, Trp14, in the wild-type structure and since a hydrogen bond between the amide NH of Trp14 and the carbonyl of Phe9 has been thought to stabilize the kink region, we initially hypothesized that Phe9 and Trp14 might serve similar functions in stabilizing the kink region (3Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). However, later studies showed that the F9A mutation supports full fusion in cell-cell fusion assays, and its strength of membrane binding and lipid perturbation is also similar to that of the wild type (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Phe9 and Trp14 are not the only residues that contribute to the stability of the kink region. Additional residues may contribute to the hydrophobic pocket in this region, stabilizing the angled structure and thereby supporting the function of the fusion domain. To examine this hypothesis, we made additional mutations of hydrophobic residues in the kink region of full-length HA and studied their effect on membrane fusion. We also used peptide models of the same mutations to assess their effects on lipid interactions that could explain their altered fusion activities. To establish that a fixed-angle boomerang structure is indeed necessary to promote fusion, we solved the structure of the F9A mutant fusion domain and measured the flexibility of the kink of wild-type and several mutant fusion domains in lipid bilayers. Peptides and Lipids—All peptides were synthesized by the Biomolecular Research Facility at the University of Virginia. Lipids and detergents were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Mutagenesis and HA Expression—Mutations were introduced into the pTM-HA (X:31) vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers were from Integrated DNA Technologies. The sequence of F9A/I10A was confirmed by complete sequencing. All other mutants were sequenced in the region around the fusion domains (> 500 bp). Wild-type and mutant HAs were expressed in CV-1 cells as described previously using 1 μg of DNA for each transfection (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and FACS were carried out as previously described (5Armstrong R.T. Kushnir A.S. White J.M. J. Cell. Biol. 2000; 151: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). SDS-gels were developed with streptavidinhorseradish peroxidase. Fusion Assays—Fusion between HA-expressing CV-1 cells that were treated with neuraminidase and trypsin and fresh human red blood cells that were double-labeled with octadecylrhodamine B chloride and carboxyfluorescein (both from Molecular Probes) was measured after a 5-min exposure to pH 5 on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The lipid and contents mixing ratios are defined as the ratios of the number of CV-1 cells that undergo lipid or content mixing to the number of CV-1 cells that bound RBCs. Bulk fluorescence dequenching experiments were carried out in a Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog 3 spectrofluorometer (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Percent fluorescence dequenching was calculated as (F1–F0)/(Fdet–F0) × 100, where F1 is the fluorescence intensity at the end of the pH 5 incubation period and before the addition of detergent, F0 is the fluorescence during the initial pH 7.0 incubation, and Fdet is the fluorescence during the final incubation in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. Preparation of Liposomes—Desired amounts of POPC and POPG were mixed in chloroform and dried overnight under vacuum. Fusion buffer (5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, pH 5) was added and vortexed to give 5 mm lipid dispersions. To prepare SUVs, the dispersion was sonicated in an ice-water bath using a Branson titanium tip ultrasonicator for ∼1 h at 50% duty cycle until it was transparent. To prepare LUVs, the dispersion was five times frozen and thawed in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath, followed by extrusion (15 times) through polycarbonate membranes with 100-nm pores (Avestin, Ottawa, CN). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a high-sensitivity MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc). For reaction enthalpy measurements, 10-μl aliquots of peptide at a concentration of around 18 μm were injected into the sample cell containing 2 ml of 5 mm POPC:POPG (4:1) SUVs. For free energy measurements, 10-μl aliquots of 5 mm POPC:POPG (4:1) SUVs were injected into the sample cell containing 2 ml of 1 mm peptide. Exact concentrations of peptides were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. The data were analyzed as previously described (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—CD spectra of fusion domains bound to SUVs, LUVs, or DPC micelles were measured at peptide:lipid ratios of 1:200 at 25 °C in an model 215 spectropolarimeter (AVIV). Polarized ATR-FTIR spectra of fusion domains bound to supported bilayers on germanium ATR plates were recorded on a Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker) and analyzed as described (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 6Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—The sample was prepared by mixing the 2 mm F9A fusion domain and 200 mm DPC in pH 5 buffer. All NMR spectra were collected on a Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (Varian). The data were processed with the program NMRPipe (7Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar), and the resonance assignments were completed with the program Sparky (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). Structural ensembles were calculated using the program DYANA (8Luginbuöhl P. Guöntert P. Billeter M. Wuöthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 136-146PubMed Google Scholar). The 30 conformers with the lowest energy target function value were further energy-minimized using the program OPAL with the Amber94 force field (8Luginbuöhl P. Guöntert P. Billeter M. Wuöthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 136-146PubMed Google Scholar). The energy-minimized conformers were aligned and displayed using the program MOLMOL (9Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuöthrich K. J. Mol. Graph 14. 1996; 51–55: 29-32Google Scholar). Continuous Wave EPR Spectroscopy—Fusion domains were labeled with the spin-label MTSSL and purified as previously described (3Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Labeling was monitored by mass spectrometry. For line-shape analysis and distance measurements, samples were mixed with molar ratios of 1:500 DPC, 1:200 SUV, or 1:200 LUV in pH 5 buffer and incubated for at least 20 min. The samples were then sealed in glass capillary tubes with an inner diameter of 0.60 mm (VitroCom Inc). To ensure the removal of potential free spin-labels, some samples were first diluted 10 times and then concentrated through a Microcon centrifugal filter with a cutoff size of 3 kDa (Millipore, Bedford, MA). EPR spectra were recorded on an E-line Centuries Series spectrometer (Varian). All spectra for line-shape analysis and CW distance determinations were recorded at 2.0 milliwatt incident power at room temperature. For power saturation measurements, the spin-labeled fusion domains were mixed with POPC:POPG (4:1) LUVs at a molar ratio of 1:1000. Spectra were collected in the presence of nitrogen, air, and nitrogen with 20 mm NiEDDA, respectively, as described previously (3Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). All spectra were analyzed with the Labview EPR analysis software developed by Drs. C. Altenbach and W. Hubbell. Double Electron-Electron Resonance Spectroscopy—The samples contained 100 μm double-spin-labeled fusion domains bound to POPC:POPG(4:1) LUVs at molar a ratio of 1:200 in pH 5 buffer. DEER measurements were performed at a temperature of 80 K on a EleXSys 580 spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a 2 mm split-ring resonator. The samples were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately before insertion into the resonator. The four-pulse sequence (π /2)ν1–τ1–(π) ν1–t–(π) ν2–(τ1 + τ2–t)–(π) ν1–τ2 -echo was used (ν1, observe frequency; ν2, pump frequency; π ν1, 32-ns pulse; π ν2, 32-ns pump pulse; τ1, 200-ns delay; τ2, 1200-ns delay; t, dipolar evolution time) (10Pannier M. Veit S. Godt A. Jeschke G. Spiess H.W. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 142: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The observed and pump frequencies were selected from the positions of the center and low field EPR maxima, respectively, of the CW spectra of each sample. 70 or more scans were added for each spectrum. Data were analyzed with the program DEERAnalysis 2006 developed by Dr. G. Jeschke. A homogeneous two-dimensional background model was applied to fit the data. Docking of NMR Structure to EPR Depth Data—The NMR structural conformer with the smallest r.m.s.d. to the mean structure of the 35 conformers was substituted with spin labels in the four measured positions. This structure was docked with the program Insight II (Accelrys) to a lipid bilayer using the depth data obtained from the EPR power saturation experiments. The dihedral angles χ1 and χ2 were set to 300°. The values of χ3 were determined for each site by energy minimization with the Amber force field and restricting their values to either +90 (p) or –90 (n). The energy-minimized structure of the substituted F9A fusion domain had the χ3 combination ppnp for the four consecutively labeled residues. Fusion Activity of HA Mutants—The influenza HA fusion domain adopts a kinked boomerang structure in membranes at pH 5 with two helical arms on either side of the kink at Asn12. Because the two aromatic residues Phe9 and Trp14 that face each other on opposite sides of the kink have different effects on fusion, we reasoned that the smaller Phe9 needs the help of the neighboring Ile10 to elicit the same effect on fusion as Trp14. To test this hypothesis, we made two new mutants in the kink region, the single-site mutant I10A and the double-site mutant F9A/I10A, examined their effects on fusion, and compared them to the previously described mutants F9A and W14A (4Lai A.L. Park H. White J.M. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5760-5770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fusion was first examined by fluorescence microscopy. R18 and CF double-labeled RBCs were bound to the HA-expressing CV-1 cells and the pH was adjusted to pH 5 to trigger fusion between the two cells. The transfer of the red dye (R18) indicates the mixing of lipids and the transfer of the green dye (CF) indicates the mixing of soluble contents between the two cells. As shown in Fig. 1, the F9A and I10A mutations did not impair lipid or content mixing, but the F9A/I10A and W14A mutations blocked both. The lipid and contents mixing ratio of I10A were around 88 and 75%, respectively, which are a little lower than those of WT, but similar to those of F9A. Because both dyes are effectively transferred, WT, F9A, and I10A are full fusion phenotypes. However, since neither dye is transferred in the F9A/I10A and W14A mutants, these mutations are identified as non-fusogenic. The kinetics of lipid mixing were further examined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Fusion between prebound cell couples was monitored by fluorescence dequenching after adjusting the pH to 5 (Fig. 2). The I10A mutant had a relatively high rate of lipid mixing, i.e. almost as high as that of WT and F9A. The mutant F9A/I10A, however, had a very low initial rate of lipid mixing, which was even lower than that of W14A. These results obtained in bulk from a large population of cells fully support the results obtained on individual cells by fluorescence microscopy. Expression and Processing of Mutant HAs on the Cell Surface—To ascertain that these results were not due to expression or proteolytic processing problems, FACS and immunoprecipitation were carried out to examine the level of surface expression and proteolytic processing of HA to form the active heterodimer HA1/HA2. For FACS analysis, the HA-expressing cells were labeled with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody followed by a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody. This experiment reveals the percentage of cells that express HA on their surface as well as the HA expression level of the population of surface HA-expressing cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the percentage of surface HA-expressing cells and the HA expression level in the HA-expressing cell population were the same for the wild type and the mutants. For immunoprecipitation, transfected CV-1 cells were first treated with a small amount of trypsin followed by labeling of all surface-expressed proteins with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. After lysis of the cells, HAs were immunoprecipitated by an anti-HA monoclonal antibody and protein A-conjugated beads. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel of Fig. 3C shows that wild type and both mutants were properly cleaved by trypsin into HA1 and HA2. Taken together, these controls show that the observed fusion phenotypes are the results of fusion defects of the mutants, and not the results of deficiencies in surface expression or proteolytic processing. Binding of HA Fusion Domains to Lipid Bilayers—To investigate the strengths of the fusion domain-lipid interactions, we used synthetic fusion peptides comprising the first 20 amino acids of the HA2 wild-type (strain X31) or mutant sequences followed by the non-perturbing hydrophilic solubility tag GCGKKKK (11Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We first measured the equilibrium partition coefficients and free energies of the binding of the wild-type and mutant fusion domains to lipid bilayers composed of POPC/POPG (4:1) by isothermal titration calorimetry. Small aliquots of SUVs were injected into the reaction cell containing the soluble fusion domains. Saturating binding curves were obtained as shown for I10A in supplemental Fig. S1A. The small residual heats that were produced after saturation are the heats of dilution that were subsequently subtracted using a control experiment. The data were plotted as mol fraction bound peptide/lipid versus free peptide, which gives a straight line with a slope corresponding to the apparent partition coefficient Kapp (supplemental Fig. S1B). Because the peptides are positively charged and the membranes are negatively charged, the concentration of free peptides near the membrane surface is different from that in buffer far away from the membrane. The contributions of this electrostatic effect, calculated by the Gouy-Chapman theory, were subtracted from Kapp as previously described (11Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), resulting in the intrinsic partition coefficients K0, and free energy change, ΔG = –RTlnK0, describing the non-electrostatic fusion domain interactions with the lipid bilayer. As shown in Table 1, the free energy changes of WT, F9A, and I10A are around –7 kcal/mol, while those of F9A/I10A and W14A are only about –5.5 kcal/mol.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of the binding of wild-type and mutant fusion domains to lipid bilayers composed of POPC/POPG (4:1) at pH 5MutantKapp/105K0/104ΔΔGΔΔH-TΔΔSm-1m-1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molWTaData of WT, F9A, and W14A are from Lai et al.

Open table in a new tab We also measured the enthalpy change associated with the binding of the fusion domains to lipid bilayers. In this case, small aliquots of peptides were injected into the reaction cell containing a large excess of SUVs. Therefore, all peptides bind to lipids at each titration step (supplemental Fig. S1C and S1D). Heats of mixing and the contribution of the binding of the hydrophilic solubility tag are subtracted by a control measurement with the tag peptide AcH7 alone (12Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), resulting in the values of ΔΔH in Table 1. WT, F9A, and I10A had similar enthalpy changes on the order of –15 to –16 kcal/mol, while the fusion-deficient mutants F9A/I10A and W14A had significantly smaller negative enthalpy changes on the order of –8 to –9 kcal/mol. Using the enthalpy and free energy changes, the entropy changes were calculated from ΔG = ΔH–TΔS (Table 1). As noted before (12Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the fusion domain-lipid interactions are driven by enthalpy and opposed by entropy. The enthalpy change, which includes contributions from folding and lipid insertion, provides the driving force for fusion domain insertion. Perturbation of Lipid Bilayer Structure by Fusion Domains—We used polarized ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to investigate the perturbation of lipid order by the binding and membrane insertion of the HA fusion domains. The order of the acyl chains in a lipid bilayer is described by the order parameter, SL, which may be calculated from the experimental ATR dichroic ratio, RATR, i.e. the ratio between the absorptions of parallel and perpendicular polarized infrared light at the lipid methylene stretch vibration frequencies around 2920 cm–1 and 2850 cm–1. A high value of RATR indicates a low order of the lipid acyl chains, and vice versa, a low value indicates high order. We determined the perturbation of the bilayer structure by comparing the dichroic ratios with and without bound fusion domains. The results presented in supplemental Fig. S2 and Table 2 show that the fusion-deficient mutants F9A/I10A and W14A perturb the bilayer structure to a significantly smaller degree than the fusion-supporting WT and mutants F9A and I10A. As shown in Fig. 4, these results correlate well with the binding and fusion data. The higher lipid order induced by the fusogenic domains may be related to a dehydration of the membrane surface, which is a prerequisite for membrane fusion. The fusion-deficient mutants do not bind strongly enough and thereby may be unable to sufficiently dehydrate the membrane surface in preparation for fusion. The active fusion domains also reduce the entropy of the system more than the inactive fusion domains when they bind to membranes (Table 1), but it is not clear whether this is primarily an effect of lipid or protein ordering.TABLE 2ATR dichroic ratios of the lipid methylene stretching vibrations and derived orders parameters in the absence and presence of bound wild-type and mutant fusion domainsRATRRATRSL2920 cm-12850 cm-1Lipid only1.36 ± 0.031.34 ± 0.030.34 ± 0.01WTaData of WT, F9A, and W14A are from Lai et al.

The observed Fe–O bond length (1.86–1.90 Å) is consistent with that of a single bond. The compound II state of myoglobin in crystals was controlled by single-crystal microspectrophotometry before and after synchrotron data collection. We observe some radiation-induced changes in both compound II (resulting in intermediate H) and in the resting ferric state of myoglobin. These radiation-induced states are quite unstable, and compound II and ferric myoglobin are immediately regenerated through a short heating above the glass transition temperature (<1 s) of the crystals. It is unclear how this influences our compound II structures compared with the unaffected compound II, but some crystallographic data suggest that the influence on the Fe–O bond distance is minimal. Based on our crystallographic and spectroscopic data we suggest that for myoglobin the compound II intermediate consists of an FeIV–O species with a single bond. The presence of FeIV is indicated by a small isomer shift of δ = 0.07 mm/s from Moössbauer spectroscopy. Earlier quantum refinements (crystallographic refinement where the molecular-mechanics potential is replaced by a quantum chemical calculation) and density functional theory calculations suggest that this intermediate H species is protonated.

Its function in oxygen storage and transportation has been well known for a long time, but more recently an understanding of Mb as a multifunction protein (functions as protection against oxidative damage and NO scavenging) has evolved (4Frauenfelder H.

Patel R.P. Cashon R.E. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 313-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that Mb can react with hydrogen peroxide and give a ferryl species in a peroxidase-style manner (but with important differences, as will be detailed below) was studied already in the 1950s (8Keilin D. Hartree E.F. Nature. 1950; 166: 513-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 9George P. Irvine D.H. Nature. 1951; 168: 164-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For a classic peroxidase, like horseradish peroxidase (HRP), the reaction cycle involves a two-electron oxidation-reduction (Scheme 1). In the first classic HRP step the resting ferric (FeIII) high spin (S = 5/2) form is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to a water molecule and a heme state that is two oxidation equivalents higher (compound I) than the resting ferric form. This first step propagates through a hydroperoxo-intermediate (compound 0) where compound I is generated through a heterolytic cleavage of the O–O bond (11Ibrahim M. Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Kincaid J.R. Sligar S.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 13714-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 12Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

The distal His is assumed to function as an acid/base catalyst to facilitate heterolytic cleavage by accepting a proton from the inner oxygen (oxygen ligated to the iron) and then donating it to the outer (leaving) oxygen. The negative charge on the leaving hydroxide during bond cleavage is then stabilized by the distal Arg in HRP (not found in Mb) (14Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the proximal His can stabilize higher oxidation states on the heme iron by hydrogen bonding to a neighboring carboxylate group, thus making the Fe-bound nitrogen more negative (14Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sono M. Roach M.P. Coulter E.D. Dawson J.H. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2841-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The compound I intermediate formed is two oxidation equivalents higher than the resting form (FeIII). One electron is withdrawn from the iron, resulting in a ferryl (FeIV = O) state with a double-bonded oxygen atom and intermediate spin state (S = 1), which could interact magnetically with radicals. Depending on the peroxidase, the second oxidizing electron comes from either the porphyrin ring, giving a π-cation radical, or from an amino acid residue (Trp or Tyr) near the heme ring (16Poulos T.L. Phil. Trans. Soc. A. 2005; 363: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Everse J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the second step of the peroxidase reaction cycle compound I carries out a substrate (e.g. organic molecules A) oxidation (A → A+·) resulting in a one-electron reduction to compound II (S = 1) by the loss of the heme/protein radical. The last step of the cycle is a further one-electron reduction of compound II to the resting ferric form accompanied again by a second substrate oxidation (A → A+·). Compound II was until a few years ago thought of as an Fe = O double bond state, but this changed when the crystal structures indicating a single-bond character were published (18Hersleth H-P. Dalhus B. Goörbitz C.H. Andersson K.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 86 (260): 260Google Scholar, 19Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szoöke H. Henriksen A. Hajdu J. Nature. 2002; 417: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of compound II all indicate this single-bond character, but some recent extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) studies lean toward a double-bond character, so the question is still under some debate (20Poulos T.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2005; 33: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Green M.T. Dawson J.H. Gray H.B.

Biochem. 2006; 100: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Mb (Scheme 1 and Fig. 1) can react with hydrogen peroxide in a manner similar to peroxidases, including oxidizing several classes of small organic molecules, but at a much lower rate (23King N.K. Winfield M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1520-1528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Guilivi C. Cadenas E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reduced efficiency can be explained by the lack of three essential residues; the Asp that forms the hydrogen bond to the proximal His, the distal Arg that stabilize the negative charge on the leaving group, and the distal His that is suggested to be too close to the heme to fully function as an acid-base catalyst during the heterolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond (14Poulos T.L.

Furthermore, a homolytic cleavage of the peroxide bond in compound 0 that gives Mb compound II and a hydroxyl radical have been suggested (29Allentoff A.J. Bolton J.L. Wilks A. Thompson J.A.

Formation of radicals was also observed in the reaction of Mb with hydrogen peroxide (32Gibson J.F. Ingram D.J.E. Nature. 1956; 178: 871-872Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For horse Mb the semi-stable radicals were shown to be a peroxyl-radical on Trp-14 and a phenoxyl-radical at Tyr-103 (33Gunther M.R. Free Rad. Biol.

Several crystal structures of these intermediates have been solved (22Hersleth H-P. Ryde U. Rydberg P. Goörbitz C.H. Andersson K.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, active site amino acids of peroxidases are involved in deprotonation/protonation of the iron-linked peroxide in the first step of the reaction cycle. In contrast, it appears that for the monooxygenases cytochrome P450 (P450), nitric-oxide synthase, and heme oxygenases it is the solvent molecules that are responsible for the protonation of the dioxygen leading to the cleavage of the O–O bond (34Poulos T.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For P450 and nitric-oxide synthase as well as for bromo- and chloroperoxidase (CPO) the proximal ligand is not a His, but a Cys, and for most catalases it is a Tyr. These three residues differ in their electron donating capability to the iron, which can lead to some differences between these enzymes. There have been some conflicting reports through the years regarding the two pH-dependent structural forms of compound II (35Andersson L.A. Dawson J.H. Struct. Bonding. 1990; 64: 1-40Google Scholar). For HRP two different distances for the Fe–O bond length in compound II (1.6 and 1.9 Å, respectively) were observed in EXAFS studies and suggested to be due the pH dependence of compound II (35Andersson L.A.

The ferryl state of Mb is important, because it is believed to be of physiological relevance through its involvement in oxidative stress reactions (5Garry D.J. Kanatous S.B. Mammen P.P.A.

During ischemia oxymyoglobin (oxyMb) is converted to ferrous deoxymyoglobin (deoxyMb), which in turn is much more easily oxidized during reperfusion when reactive oxygen species are formed, initially to ferric Mb and then further to ferryl Mb (43Arduini A.

Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but it can be reduced back to ferric Mb if the supply of reductants is sufficient (43Arduini A. Hochstein P. Oxidative Damage & Repair. 1991; (Davies, K. J., ed) pp. , Pergamon, Oxford: 406-414Google Scholar) and thereby plays a defensive role in protection of the heart by removal of reactive oxygen species (45Floögel U. Goödecke A. Klotz L-O. Schrader J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1156-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Mb can function as a detoxifier of both H2O2 and NO (46Herold S. Rehmann F-J.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 543-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). High valent Mb may, however, have harmful effects by oxidizing lipids and be involved in muscle injury and subsequent renal failure, in which heme to protein cross-linked Mb and acidic pH play an important role (42Reeder B.J.

In the present study we try to elucidate the structure of Mb compound II by the use of crystallography in combination with spectroscopy and previous theoretical studies (22Hersleth H-P. Ryde U. Rydberg P. Goörbitz C.H. Andersson K.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 48Nilsson K. Hersleth H-P. Rod T.H Andersson K.K Ryde U. Biophys.

In the crystallographic studies the potential radiation damage and radiation-induced reduction of the metal-center must be addressed. The use of light absorption on small protein crystals, so-called single-crystal microspectrophotometry, is essential for generation of the correct oxidation state, and for monitoring changes of this state during data collection for proteins (19Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szoöke H. Henriksen A. Hajdu J. Nature. 2002; 417: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 49Srajer V. Ren Z. Teng T-Y. Schmidt M. Ursby T. Bourgeois D.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). About 90% of the interacting x-ray photons deposit their energy into the crystal lattice mainly through the photoelectric effect by generating electrons (50Wilmot C.M. Sjoögren T. Carlsson G.H. Berglund G.I. Hajdu J. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 353: 301-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This, together with further secondary electron emission, produces reactive species that can lead to radiation damage. The x-ray diffraction experiment then generates potential reducing equivalents (electrons) that can change the redox-state of metal-proteins (51Carugo O. Carugo K.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 213-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The importance of these questions and the use of single-crystal microspectrophotometry was acknowledged early in the study of these peroxidase, oxygenase, and catalase intermediates (52Jouve H-M. Andreoletti P. Gouet P. Hajdu J. Gagnon J. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 53Fuöloöp V. Phizackerley R.P. Soltis S.M. Clifton I.J. Watatsuki S.

Nussaume L. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 951-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The actual rate by which these intermediates are reduced varies considerably among proteins (22Hersleth H-P. Ryde U. Rydberg P. Goörbitz C.H. Andersson K.K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 460-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The use of single-crystal microspectrophotometry is therefore essential to determine the redox-state correctly in each case. The use of crystallography in combination with microspectrophotometry, resonance Raman (rRaman), and Moössbauer spectroscopy suggests that compound II has a single FeIV–O bond and is probably protonated. Purification and Crystallization—Horse heart Mb (Sigma) was further purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G75 column using the absorption ratio of 410/280 nm as the purification criterion. Mb was crystallized at three pH values: 5.2, 6.8, and 8.7. The crystals were grown at room temperature by batch methods with a 6–12 mg/ml Mb concentration and 80–85% of the crystallization stock solution (55Hersleth H-P. Dalhus B. Goörbitz C.H. Andersson K.K. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 56Sherwood C. Mauk A.G. Brayer G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 227Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The stock solution contained 3.9 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m buffer depending on the pH and 5–10% of glycerol. No buffer was applied at pH 5.2, whereas MOPS or HEPES was used at pH 6.8 and TAPS at pH 8.7. Rosette-shaped clusters of thin, plate-shaped crystals were grown within 1–7 days. X-ray Data Collection—For each x-ray diffraction experiment a single crystal was separated from a rosette and transferred into a cryo-solution containing 75–80% crystallization stock solution and 20–25% glycerol. Compound II intermediates were prepared by 30 s of incubation in a cryo-solution to which had been added H2O2 to a final concentration of 22 mm, with subsequent flash freezing in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were mainly collected at the Swiss-Norwegian Beam Line (SNBL) BM01A at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France, but also at beamline ID14-3 at ESRF and at beamline X11 at EMBL, DESY, Hamburg, Germany (Table 1). Usually, two separate scans, at high and low resolution, were collected using at SNBL a MAR345 image plate, at ID14-3 a ADSC Q4R charge-coupled device detector and at X11 a MARCCD 165-mm detector. Data collection temperatures were in the range of 100–110 K.TABLE 1Crystal data, data collection, and refinement statisticsRadiation-induced Mb comp.

The integral membrane proteins TatA, TatB, and TatC are essential components of the Tat pathway. TatA forms high order oligomers and is thought to constitute the protein-translocating unit of the Tat system. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis was used to systematically investigate the functional importance of residues in the essential N-terminal transmembrane and amphipathic helices of Escherichia coli TatA. Cysteine substitutions of most residues in the amphipathic helix, including all the residues on the hydrophobic face of the helix, severely compromise Tat function. Glutamine 8 was identified as the only residue in the transmembrane helix that is critical for TatA function. The cysteine variants in the transmembrane helix were used in disulfide mapping experiments to probe the oligomeric arrangement of TatA protomers within the larger TatA complex. Residues in the center of the transmembrane helix (including residues 10–16) show a distinct pattern of cross-linking indicating that this region of the protein forms well defined interactions with other protomers. At least two interacting faces were detected. The results of our TatA studies are compared with analogous data for the homologous, but functionally distinct, TatB protein. This comparison reveals that it is only in TatA that the amphipathic helix is sensitive to amino acid substitutions.

They are predicted to share a common structure comprising an N-terminal transmembrane α-helix, followed by a basic amphipathic α-helix, and then a water-soluble C-terminal region of variable length (Fig. 1A).

Gene fusion experiments have been used to suggest that the amphipathic helix of TatA may change topology in the course of protein translocation (25Gouffi K. Gerard F. Santini C.L. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11608-11615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas disulfide cross-linking experiments carried out with the chloroplast Tha4 protein also suggest a rearrangement of the amphipathic helix during transport (23Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It is likely that the amphipathic helix either forms or controls access to the pathway of transmembrane substrate movement (6Cline K. Theg S.M. Dalbey R.E. Koehler C. The Enzymes. 2007Google Scholar, 16Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5476-5483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An alternative approach to understanding TatA structure-function relationships is to identify which features of the TatA molecule distinguish it from the homologous, but functionally distinct, TatB protein. Domain swapping experiments between the two proteins have been used to infer that the transmembrane helix confers the distinctive properties of TatA, whereas the amphipathic helix is necessary specifically for TatB function (17Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). More recently, a genetic suppressor selection was used to isolate TatA variants that could simultaneously substitute for both wild-type TatA and TatB functions (26Blaudeck N. Kreutzenbeck P. Muöller M. Sprenger G.A. Freudl R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3426-3432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These variants have amino acid substitutions in the early part of the TatA transmembrane helix. To obtain a more complete picture of structure-function relationships within the TatA protein we have carried out systematic cysteine scanning mutagenesis of the entire functionally essential region of the TatA molecule. These studies have identified so far unrecognized residues that are important for TatA function. Scanning disulfide mapping experiments have been used to identify regions of the TatA molecule that are involved in forming protomer-protomer interactions. We have also compared the cysteine scanning mutagenesis and disulfide mapping data obtained with TatA to equivalent data that we previously reported for the homologous, but functionally distinct, TatB protein (27Lee P.A. Orriss G.L. Buchanan G. Greene N.P. Bond P.J. Punginelli C. Jack R.L. Sansom M.S. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34072-34085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This comparison reveals differences between the two proteins in both functionally important residues and protomer-protomer interactions, which help in understanding the distinct roles of TatA and TatB in the Tat protein transport system.

Plasmid pUNITATA contains the tatA gene in pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene). pUNITATA was constructed by amplifying the tatA gene with primers TATA5 (8Sargent F. Bogsch E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Robinson C. Berks B.C. Palmer T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3640-3650Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and UNIA1 (5′-GCGCGGATCCCACGTGTTACACCTGCTCTTTATCG-3′), digesting the product with EcoRI and BamHI, and then cloning it into pBluescript II SK+ that had been previously digested with the same enzymes. Site-specific cysteine mutations were initially introduced into the tatA gene in pUNITATA using the QuikChange™ method (Stratagene). Each mutation was subsequently subcloned into pUNITATCC4 for cysteine cross-linking and TMAO reductase assays. All clones obtained from PCR-amplified DNA were sequenced to ensure that no undesired mutations had been introduced. The primer sequences for introduction of site-specific mutations are available on request. Cell Growth, Fractionation, and Protein Methods—During all genetic manipulations, and for cysteine cross-linking experiments, E. coli strains were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (29Russell D.W. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2001; (, 3rd Ed., Cold Spring Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY)Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Concentrations of antibiotics were as described previously (10Sargent F. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1197) Google Scholar). Membranes for cysteine cross-linking experiments were prepared from cells harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl supplemented with DNase I, 0.6 mg ml–1 lysozyme, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were disrupted by three passages through a French pressure cell at 8,000 p.s.i., and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 4 °C for 15 min. The total membrane fraction was then collected by centrifugation at 150,000 × g and 4 °C for 90 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C until use. For TMAO reductase assays cells were cultured anoxically at 37 °C in 30 ml of modified Cohen and Rickenberg medium (31Cohen G.N. Rickenberg H.W. Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1956; 91: 693-720PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.4% TMAO. Subcellular fractions were prepared using a cold osmotic shock protocol (32Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and TMAO:benzylviologen oxidoreductase activity was measured as described (33Silvestro A. Pommier J. Giordano G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 954: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting analyses were as described before (34Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3024) Google Scholar, 35Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar), and immunoreactive bands were visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal TatA antibodies were as described (36Sargent F. Gohlke U. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations for the TMAO reductase assays were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (37Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the cysteine cross-linking experiments using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Cysteine Scanning Mutagenesis—We employed cysteine scanning mutagenesis to systematically probe the importance of residues in the E. coli TatA protein. Previous studies have shown that the C-terminal tail of TatA is not essential for Tat transport (17Lee P.A. Buchanan G. Stanley N.R. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5871-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Hicks M.G. Lee P.A. Georgiou G. Berks B.C. Palmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore restricted our analysis to residues 2–43 within the critical N-terminal region. This range of substitutions contains the predicted transmembrane and amphipathic helices (Fig. 1A). Each mutant tatA allele was introduced into an expression plasmid carrying a tatABC operon that had been modified to remove all endogenous cysteine codons (i.e. the four in TatC). It has previously been demonstrated that a cysteineless TatC protein does not display significant defects in Tat-dependent transport (38Buchanan G. de Leeuw E. Stanley N.R. Wexler M. Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The effect of individual cysteine substitutions on the transport activity of the Tat system was examined by assessing the extent to which the variant-coding plasmid could restore the Tat transport activity of a strain lacking Tat function. Tat transport activity was quantified in these experiments by measuring the amount of the Tat substrate trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase that reaches the periplasm. All variants with cysteine substitutions in the predicted transmembrane helix retained significant levels of Tat transport activity with the notable exception of the Gln-8 to Cys substitution (Fig. 2A). The distinctive phenotype of the Gln-8 substitution prompted us to test the side-chain requirement at this position in more detail (Fig. 3). Replacement of the glutamine by asparagine, which retains the functionality of the side chain but decreases its length by one carbon atom, did not significantly affect the activity of the TatA protein. Substantive transport activity was also retained upon substitution of the glutamine by glutamate, a change that modifies the hydrogen-bonding potential of the side chain and introduces a potentially ionizable group. However, a variant in which the side-chain functionality was removed by an alanine substitution was, like the cysteine substitution, not able to support Tat transport.FIGURE 3Relative Tat transport activities of variants of TatA with substitutions at position 8. Tat transport activity was assessed by measuring the activity of the Tat substrate TMAO reductase in the periplasmic fraction of cells grown in TMAO-containing medium. Data are shown for strain DADE-P (ΔtatABCDΔtatE pcnB) containing no plasmid (“None”), transformed with plasmid pUNITATCC4, which expresses cysteineless TatABC (“WT”), or containing derivatives of pUNITATCC4 in which the tatA gene encodes specific single amino acid variants at position 8 (the nature of the substitution in the TatA protein is shown under each column). All activities are quoted relative to that of the strain carrying the parental plasmid pUNITATCC4. Three independent cultures of each strain were each assayed in triplicate. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In marked contrast to the tolerance of the transmembrane helix to cysteine substitutions the majority of the cysteine substitutions in the amphipathic helix abolished Tat activity (Fig. 2B). Of the seven mutants that retained significant activity, three were conservative serine to cysteine substitutions. Disulfide Cross-linking—The availability of a set of single cysteine variants of TatA presented an opportunity to use disulfide cross-linking to probe the interactions between the protomers in TatA complexes in their native membrane environment. This approach is expected to be particularly useful in analyzing the interactions of the predicted transmembrane helix, because this helix is essential for TatA oligomerization (24Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Wallis R. van den Brink-van der Laan E. de Kruijff B. Wallace B.A. Palmer T. Berks B.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13690-13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and is, thus, presumably in direct contact with the transmembrane helices of other TatA protomers. A cysteine residue in the transmembrane helix of one protomer should be at the same vertical height in the membrane as the same cysteine residue in another protomer. Whether the two cysteine residues can approach closely enough to form a disulfide bond will, therefore, depend on the relative arrangement of the helices within the plane of the membrane (Fig. 1B). To determine the disulfide cross-linking patterns of single cysteine TatA variants we co-expressed each variant with TatBC using the same plasmids that were employed for the activity studies. Subcellular fractionation of the strains followed by immunoblotting with anti-TatA serum established that all our cysteine variants were expressed and localized to the membrane fraction of the cells although some variation in TatA levels was noted (Figs. 4, 5, 6).FIGURE 5Disulfide cross-linking of TatA variants with single cysteine substitutions in the predicted amphipathic helix. E. coli strain DADE-P (ΔtatABCDΔtatE pcnB) was transformed with the plasmid pUNITATCC4 encoding cysteineless TatBC together with either the wild type TatA protein (WT) or a single cysteine variant (as labeled). The cells were cultured aerobically in LB medium at 37 °C and processed as detailed below. The extent of cross-linking was assessed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with anti-TatA serum. The monomer and dimer of TatA are indicated with one or two stars, respectively. The uncharacterized TatA adduct is indicated by a horizontal bar.

E. coli strain DADE-P (ΔtatABCDΔtatE pcnB) was transformed with the plasmid pUNITATCC4 encoding cysteineless TatBC together with either the wild type TatA protein (WT) or a single cysteine variant (as labeled). The cells were cultured aerobically in LB medium at 37 °C and a membrane fraction prepared. Membrane samples (30 μg of total protein) were incubated for 60 min at 20 °C in the presence of 1 mm of the oxidation catalyst CuP (lanes O), or 10 mm of the reductant dithiothreitol (lanes R), or were incubated with buffer alone (lanes C). Reactions were quenched by addition of NEM to 25 mm final concentration and EDTA to 50 mm final concentration. The I12C panel contains an additional control experiment to demonstrate the efficacy of the quenching reaction. In this experiment (lane B) the sample was treated with the quenching agents for 10 min prior to CuP addition, and the sample was then incubated for a further 60 min. The extent of cross-linking was assessed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with anti-TatA serum. The monomer and dimer of TatA are indicated with one or two stars, respectively. The uncharacterized TatA adduct is indicated by a horizontal bar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It was immediately apparent for variants with cysteine substitutions at the N terminus of the transmembrane helix (residues 2–8) that TatA was present in the purified membrane fractions predominantly in the form of a cross-linked dimer (Fig. 4A). To test whether these cross-links had been formed in vivo we treated cells expressing the TatA variants with the membrane-permeant thiol-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) prior to harvesting. NEM will react with any free cysteine thiols present in the TatA variants in vivo and thus prevent these residues forming disulfide bridges during cell fractionation. NEM treatment decreased the proportion of TatA present in disulfide-linked dimers (Fig. 4B). We, therefore, conclude that the close to quantitative cross-linking exhibited in purified membranes by the cysteine variants at positions 2–8 takes place partially in vivo and partially during preparation of the membranes. The observation that cysteine variants at positions 2–8 exhibit substantive in vivo disulfide bond formation suggests that this region of TatA may be exposed to the oxidizing environment at the periplasmic side of the membrane. The major route of disulfide bond formation in E. coli is the periplasmic DsbAB system in which DsbA is the primary oxidant (39Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). However, the cross-linking pattern of the position 2–8 variants was not altered when the variants were expressed in a dsbA null background (data not shown). The observation that all cysteine variants at positions 2–8 show strong disulfide cross-linking suggests that this region of the protein has high conformational flexibility. Because the position 2–8 variants are almost fully cross-linked following isolation of the membranes, no further analysis of the cross-linking propensity of this region of the TatA molecule was possible. Cysteine variants in the amphipathic helix also generally exhibited significant dimer formation following membrane purification (Fig. 5A). However, in complete contrast to the behavior of the position 2–8 variants no disulfide cross-links were seen for the amphipathic helix variants following in vivo NEM treatment (Fig. 5B). We conclude that the disulfide bonds seen in the membrane samples of the amphipathic helix variants form during cell fractionation. Importantly, this allows us to exclude the possibilit"

To examine the physiologic consequences resulting from ADAR2 misexpression, we have generated mutant mice expressing either wild-type or deaminase-deficient ADAR2 transgenes under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Transgenic mice expressing either wild-type or inactive ADAR2 isoforms demonstrated adult onset obesity characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, and increased adiposity. Paired feeding analysis revealed that mutant mice on caloric restriction had a growth rate and body composition indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, indicating that the observed obesity predominantly results from hyperphagia rather than a metabolic derangement. The observation that expression of catalytically inactive ADAR2 also is capable of producing an obese phenotype in mutant animals suggests that ADAR2 may possess additional biological activities beyond those required for the site-selective deamination of adenosine or may interfere with the actions of other double-stranded RNA-specific binding proteins in the cell.

The conversion of adenosine to inosine by RNA editing results in subtle alterations in the primary nucleotide sequence of mature mRNAs, thereby producing specific changes in amino acid coding potential that can affect the biological activity of the resulting protein(s) (1Emeson R.B.

ADAR2, a member of the ADAR family, has been shown to be involved in the editing of numerous mammalian pre-mRNAs to affect subsequent protein function, including transcripts encoding glutamate-gated ion channels, a voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1.1), and the 2C subtype of serotonin receptor (5Melcher T.

Genetically modified mice lacking ADAR2 expression develop progressive seizures and die by postnatal day 21 due to a lack of editing (Q/R site) in transcripts encoding a subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid subtype glutamate receptor (GluR-2) (8Higuchi M.

Nature. 2000; 406: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), demonstrating the critical role that ADAR2 plays in the normal development and function of the central nervous system. Multiple cDNA isoforms of ADAR2 have been identified in rats, mice, and humans resulting from alternative splicing events that affect protein expression and function (9Gerber A. O'Connell M.A. Keller W. RNA. 1997; 3: 453-463PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lai F. Chen C.X. Carter K.C. Nishikura K. Mol. Cell.

Use of an alternative 3′-splice site near the 5′-end of the ADAR2 coding region produces a –1 frameshift to generate a truncated protein lacking the dsRBDs and catalytic deaminase domain required for editing activity (11Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Use of this proximal 3′-acceptor is dependent upon the ability of ADAR2 to edit its own pre-mRNA, thereby providing a unique negative autoregulatory strategy by which ADAR2 can modulate its own expression (11Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Feng Y. Sansam C.L. Singh M. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell.

To examine whether over- or misexpression of ADAR2 could result in the aberrant editing of ADAR2 target RNAs and subsequent physiologic changes, we generated mutant mouse lines expressing ADAR2 transgenes under the control of the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Results from these studies have indicated that expression of transgenes encoding either wild-type or catalytically inactive ADAR2 protein results in maturity onset obesity characterized by hyperphagia and elevated plasma levels of leptin and glucose. The observation that expression of catalytically inactive ADAR2 also is capable of producing an obese phenotype in mutant animals suggests that ADAR2 may possess additional biological activities beyond those required for the site-selective deamination of adenosine or may act as a competitive inhibitor of other dsRNA-specific binding proteins in the cell. Construction of FLAG-ADAR2b and FLAG-ADAR2b (E396A) Transgenes—A NotI restriction site, an initiation codon, and a FLAG epitope tag (DYKDDDDK) were introduced into the wild-type rat ADAR2b cDNA (11Rueter S.M.

A 2.9-kb NruI-XbaI fragment encompassing 660 bp of the human CMV promoter and the ADAR2b coding region was further subcloned into a pBSK–-based plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) that contained a 2.1-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment with the entire human growth hormone (hGH) gene derived from the p0GH plasmid (13Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Introduction of the E396A mutation was performed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and the deaminase-deficient transgene was assembled as described for the wild-type FLAG-rADAR2b-hGH construct. For the generation of wild-type and deaminase-deficient rADAR2b transgenes containing the SV40 polyadenylation signal, an initiation codon and three tandem copies of the influenza hemagglutinin tag (YPYDVPDYA) were introduced into the wild-type rat ADAR2b cDNAs immediately upstream of amino acid position 2 in the open reading frame by PCR amplification. Transgenes bearing the hemagglutinin-tagged cDNAs were assembled in a manner identical to that described for FLAG-rADAR2b-hGH transgene except for the presence of a 682-bp BamHI-EcoRI fragment of pcDNA1 (Invitrogen; positions 3120–3801) containing the SV40 polyadenylation signal in place of the hGH-derived sequences. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenes were microinjected into the pronucleus of C57Bl/6J × DBA2 (F1) hybrid embryos (14Palmiter R.D.

For mice bearing wild-type or deaminase-deficient ADAR2b-hGH transgenes, 20 μg of mouse genomic DNA was digested with ApaI and resolved by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Denatured DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Biosciences), baked in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80 °C, and hybridized to a 32P-labeled DNA probe, as described previously (16Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1998; (, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar), using a randomprimed probe (Prime-It II; Stratagene) generated from a 2.1-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment containing the entire human growth hormone gene (13Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar); the expected 2.6- and 3.7-kb hybridizing fragments were detected in multiple founder animals for each transgene construct (data not shown). For rapid screening of transgenic mice by PCR, genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood using the RED Extract-N-Amp Blood PCR Kit (Sigma) and amplified using sense and antisense primers corresponding to positions 258–275 and 639–659 relative to the start codon of rat ADAR2, respectively. The 402-bp PCR amplicon was subsequently digested with ApaI to generate 313- and 89-bp fragments for the rat ADAR2 transgene or an uncut 402-bp fragment for mouse ADAR2-derived sequences. All studies were performed on wild-type or hemizygous transgenic animals that were subsequently maintained on a C57BL/6J × DBA2 hybrid background by back-crossing to the C57BL/6J × DBA2 (F1) parental strain. RNA Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For quantification of expression levels for transgene-derived RNA transcripts, ribonuclease (RNase) protection analysis was performed, essentially as described (17Emeson R.B. Hedjran F. Yeakley J.M. Guise J.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1989; 341: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), using an antisense probe uniformly labeled with [α-32P]UTP corresponding to a region from –6to +313, relative to the start codon of the rat ADAR2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_012894). Due to sequence differences between the rat ADAR2-derived transgene and endogenous mouse ADAR2 RNAs, the probe generates a 343-nt protected fragment from transgene-derived RNA transcripts. A 111-nt antisense RNA probe for cyclophilin (nucleotides 34–144; GenBank™ accession number M19533) was used as an internal control for RNA loading and normalization of expression levels. Reaction products were separated on a 4% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel, and the relative levels of protected fragments were quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager. To assess the expression of specific 2C subtype of serotonin receptor (5-HT2CR) RNA isoforms in mouse hypothalamus, the editing of individual cDNA isolates was determined by pyrosequencing analysis as described previously (18Sodhi M.S. Airey D.C. Lambert W. Burnet P.W. Harrison P.J. Sanders-Bush E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine the extent of site-selective editing for other ADAR substrates, first-strand cDNA was synthesized and amplified using gene-specific primers and assessed using a modified primer extension analysis (11Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar); the primers and mixtures of deoxy- and dideoxynucleotides used in each primer-extension assay are indicated in supplemental Table S1. To quantify levels of ADAR1, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) and subjected to Taqman real time PCR analysis (Applied Biosystems). All primers and probes used for the real time PCRs were products of Assay-On-Demand from Applied Biosystems (ADAR1, Assay ID Mm00508001_m1; NPY, Assay ID Mm00445771_m1; POMC, Assay ID Mm00435874_m1). Eukaryotic 18 S rRNA (product 4319413E; Applied Biosystems) was included in each multiplex PCR as an internal control. Real-time PCRs and subsequent analyses were performed with the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (SDS version 2.1; Applied Biosystems). Quantification of target gene expression in all samples was normalized to 18 S rRNA expression (Cttarget – Ct18 S =ΔCt) as previously described (12Feng Y. Sansam C.L. Singh M. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western Blotting Analysis—Total cellular lysates were prepared using modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA 630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1% aprotinin) as described previously (16Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1998; (, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York)Google Scholar); 25 μg of each protein sample were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Super; Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with an affinity-purified ADAR2-specific antiserum raised against amino acids 6–66 of the rat ADAR2 open reading frame (19Sansam C.L. Wells K.S. Emeson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14018-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and a β-actin-specific antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and detected with an Alexa Fluor 680-labeled secondary antiserum. Total immunoreactive ADAR2 protein was quantified using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and normalized to the level of β-actin immunoreactive material in each tissue sample. Body Composition—Quantification of global body fat in whole animals was performed by magnetic resonance imaging using a modified fast spin echo for the fat suppression difference method (20Baudouin C.J. Bryant D.J. Young I.R. Br. J. Radiol. 1992; 65: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar); the modified fast spin echo sequence was verified with a phantom containing water and olive oil. Because image acquisition was not respiration-gated, data analysis was limited to the hind portion of the mouse to avoid motion artifacts. Fat measurements were made by acquiring data from the implementation of three different forms of a fast spin echo sequence. The first two acquisitions were used primarily for quantification of fat and water: one acquisition with fat suppression pulses centered on the fat resonance and one with no fat suppression pulses applied. A third acquisition was used to check for the possibility of direct saturation of the water peak, whereby the suppression pulses were placed on the opposite side of the water resonance but at the same chemical shift difference as the fat resonance. Fat suppression was achieved with saturation by a series of three 10-ms Gaussian pulses centered on the fat resonance, followed by an increasing crusher gradient amplitude after each pulse; the nominal suppression bandwidth was 700 Hz. The saturation pulses were placed in front of a fast spin echo imaging sequence, using an echo time of 6 ms and a repetition time of 1 s. Eight echoes were collected, with the first echo being centered on K-space. This was done to minimize both T2 losses and chemical shift artifacts. Slice thickness was 2 mm with no slice gap and a field of view of 60; the acquired image matrix was 256 × 128. Each of the three scans took approximately 5 min. All images were acquired with a Varian Inova spectrometer (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA) operating at 7 teslas. Fat and water levels were determined by the subtraction of the two corresponding images. Water-fat difference images were analyzed with MATLAB (Mathworks, Inc.). Percentage of fat was defined as IFat = 1 – (INS – IS)/(INS) × 100, where INS represents the intensity from the nonsuppressed image and IS is the intensity of the suppressed image. The analysis implemented a pixel-by-pixel subtraction, followed by application of a threshold. The effect of direct saturation of water was found not to be a contributing factor in the experiments. This was verified by subtraction of images acquired with no saturation pulses and those images in which saturation pulses were placed at the same frequency as fat but in the opposite frequency direction. These difference images yielded images at the noise level, indicating no measurable effects of direct saturation. Growth Rate and Plasma Hormone Analysis—Mice were maintained on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle in a humidity- and temperature-controlled room with water and standard laboratory chow (mouse chow 5015; Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) supplied ad libitum. The growth rates of transgenic mice and control littermates were monitored on a weekly basis between 0900 and 1000 h. Blood from ad libitum fed mice was collected by retro-orbital sinus puncture with heparinized capillary tubes. Blood glucose levels were measured from whole blood using a B-Glucose analyzer and Hemocue strips (Hemocue, Lake Forest, CA); leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay using 25 μl of plasma with recombinant mouse leptin as a standard (Linco Research, Inc., St. Charles, MO). Activity and Metabolic Analysis—Locomotor activity, oxygen consumption (VO2), and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) of mice were measured using a four-chamber Oxymax system with automatic temperature and light controls and equipped with infrared beams crossing the cage to assess animal movement (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Temperature was maintained at 23 °C, and lights were on from 0600 to 1800 h. System settings included a flow rate of 0.5 liters/min, a sample line purge time of 2 min, and a measurement period of 60 s every 15 min. Mice had ad libitum access to chow and water. The respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was calculated as the ratio of carbon dioxide produced (VCO2) divided by oxygen consumed (VO2) (21Elia M. Livesey G. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1992; 70: 68-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Feeding Behavior—Cumulative food consumption was assessed for wild-type and transgenic animals using an automated feeding apparatus that measured free feeding behavior by allowing animals ad libitum access to food cups that were mounted on a balance and monitored every 30 s (22Jones J.R. Barrick C. Kim K.A. Lindner J. Blondeau B. Fujimoto Y. Shiota M. Kesterson R.A. Kahn B.B. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6207-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). All feeding studies were performed after animals had been acclimated to the apparatus for at least 24 h. Weight-matched transgenic and control littermates were subjected to a paired feeding paradigm (23Kurtz T.W. Morris R.C. Pershadsingh H.A. Hypertension. 1989; 13: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 24Furuhata Y. Kagaya R. Hirabayashi K. Ikeda A. Chang K.T. Nishihara M. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) in which mice were housed individually and permitted to acclimate to this condition for 3 days before food intake measurements using a normal mouse chow diet. Food intake amounts for ad libitum fed transgenic and wild-type mice were measured daily starting at 4 weeks of age. Pair feeding was accomplished by measuring the food intake of the ad libitum fed control animals every 24 h; the following day, individually housed transgenic mice (pair-fed group) were given the average amount of food consumed by the control mice on the previous day. Body weight was monitored on a weekly basis. To assess the ability of leptin and d-fenfluramine to suppress feeding behavior, mice were housed singly and acclimated for 72 h prior to the onset of feeding studies. Mice were fasted overnight, and ad libitum access to food was provided 30 min after intraperitoneal administration of leptin (2.5 μg/g mouse) in phosphate-buffered saline (25Tecott L.H. Sun L.M. Akana S.F. Strack A.M. Lowenstein D.H. Dallman M.F. Julius D. Nature. 1995; 374: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar) or d-fenfluramine (3 μg/g mouse) in 0.9% saline (26Nonogaki K. Strack A.M. Dallman M.F. Tecott L.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1152-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Total food consumption was measured for 6 and 10 h after administration of d-fenfluramine and leptin, respectively. Tissue Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells were transiently co-transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) with increasing amounts (5, 10, and 15 μg) of FLAG-rADAR2b-hGH or FLAG-rADAR2b(E396A)-hGH with a constant level of ADAR1 cDNA (5 μg) and a 289-bp 5HT2CR minigene (5 μg) in each transfection (6Burns C.M.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4941-4951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The total amount of plasmid DNA in each transfection was kept constant using an empty expression vector plasmid (pRC/CMV; Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 72 h after transfection and total RNA was isolated for quantification of A site editing by primer extension analysis as described above. Statistical Analysis—Standard statistical analysis (Student’s t test, analysis of variance, and χ2) were applied depending upon the type of experiment and performed using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values are reported as mean ± S.E., except where indicated. Statistical significance of body weight, cumulative food intake, hypothalamic neuropeptide mRNA expression, ADAR1 mRNA expression, and plasma hormone analysis between genotypes was determined by Student’s t test. Percentage editing of 5-HT2CR transcripts from control and rADAR2b-hGH transgenic animals was compared by χ2 analysis for five editing sites. Differences in the growth rate and RER were analyzed using Student’s t test and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey’s multiple comparison test, respectively; a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Transgenic Mice Expressing Wild-type and Deaminase-deficient ADAR2b-hGH Demonstrate Maturity Onset Obesity—To determine if overexpression of ADAR2 resulted in either altered editing patterns or phenotypic alterations, we generated transgenic mice in which the cDNA encoding rat ADAR2b was modified with an amino-terminal epitope (FLAG) tag and placed under control of the CMV promoter (Fig. 1A, left). Since negative autoregulation of ADAR2 protein expression by RNA editing has been shown to occur at the level of pre-mRNA splicing (11Rueter S.M. Dawson T.R. Emeson R.B. Nature. 1999; 399: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Feng Y. Sansam C.L. Singh M. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the cDNA encoding an ADAR2 transgene is not subject to such modulation. Due to the broad expression pattern for ADAR2 (3Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar), we chose the CMV promoter, since it previously has been shown to demonstrate efficient expression in numerous cell types (28Davis M.G. Huang E.S. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1988; 10: 6-12PubMed Google Scholar). The hGH gene was added to the transgene construct as 3′-untranslated information, based upon studies indicating that multiple splicing events can significantly increase the level of transgene expression (14Palmiter R.D. Sandgren E.P. Avarbock M.R. Allen D.D. Brinster R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 15Brinster R.L. Allen J.M. Behringer R.R. Gelinas R.E. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 836-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Transgenic founder animals (C57BL/6 × DBA2 (F1)) were screened by Southern blotting and PCR amplification of genomic DNA (data not shown); four independent founder animals were shown to carry the transgene, and subsequent offspring were viable, fertile, and initially indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. Total body weight was monitored for the offspring of a single founder animal for 25 weeks, demonstrating a dramatic increase in body weight for both male and female transgenic mice that reached statistical significance at 8 and 18 weeks, respectively, when compared with wild-type littermates (Figs. 1, B and C). Both male and female transgenic mice experienced normal life spans in which they continue to gain weight, reaching as much as 90 and 125 g by 15 months of age, respectively (data not shown). Although the transgene copy number for each mutant line was not determined, nearly identical growth patterns were observed for the offspring of all four independent founder animals, indicating that the altered phenotype was a result of transgene expression rather than the disruption of a specific genomic locus from random transgene integration (data not shown). To ascertain whether the altered growth rate in mutant mice resulted from transgene-mediated increases in adenosine to inosine conversion for endogenous ADAR substrates, we developed an additional strain of transgenic animals in which the deaminase domain of the ADAR2b transgene was selectively inactivated by mutation of a highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu396) required for proton transfer during catalysis (29Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Previous studies of ADAR1 with an analogous glutamate-to-alanine substitution at position 912 (E912A) demonstrated a complete abolition of deaminase activity without affecting substrate RNA binding capability (29Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Kim U. Wang Y. Sanford T. Zeng Y. Nishikura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11457-11461Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To verify that the introduced point mutation (E396A) resulted in ADAR2 inactivation, we examined editing activity on ADAR2 (–1 site; Fig. 2), GluR-2 (Q/R site), and 5-HT2CR (D site) transcripts using a heterologous expression system as well as a synthetic duplex RNA using an in vitro editing system (data not shown), yet no editing was observed for any of these substrates. We generated two independent lines of transgenic mice bearing the ADAR2b (E396A) transgene, yet these mutant animals demonstrated an increased growth rate and obesity that were indistinguishable from mice expressing the catalytically active ADAR2b protein (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrated that the increased growth rate of transgenic animals was dependent upon the expression of transgene-derived ADAR2b yet could not result from a direct increase in the editing of endogenous ADAR2 substrates. Maturity Onset Obesity in ADAR2 Transgenic Mice Does Not Result from Aberrant Growth Hormone Expression—Although the entire hGH gene was added to ADAR2b constructs as a 3′-untranslated sequence to increase transgene expression (Fig. 1A, left), the dramatic increase in body mass for mice expressing active or deaminase-deficient ADAR2b-hGH transgenes mice raised questions regarding whether unanticipated hGH expression could be responsible for the observed increase in growth. Previous studies have shown that transgenic mice expressing the rat growth hormone gene demonstrate an increase in growth rate and body length accompanied by increased lean body mass (31Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Hammer R.E. Trumbauer M.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Birnberg N.C. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 300: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). More recent studies, however, have revealed that although transgenic rats expressing hi"
https://openalex.org/W2028243443,"Helicobacter pylori, bacteria that colonize the human gastric mucosa, are naturally competent for transformation by exogenous DNA, and show a panmictic population structure. To understand the mechanisms involved in its horizontal gene transfer, we sought to define the interval required from exposure to substrate DNA until DNA uptake and expression of a selectable phenotype, as well as the relationship of transforming fragment length, concentration, homology, symmetry, and strandedness, to the transformation frequency. We provide evidence that natural transformation in H. pylori differs in efficiency among wild-type strains but is saturable and varies with substrate DNA length, symmetry, strandedness, and species origin. We show that H. pylori cells can be transformed within one minute of contact with DNA, by DNA fragments as small as 50 bp, and as few as 5 bp on one flank of a selectable single nucleotide mutation is sufficient substrate for recombination of a transforming fragment, and that double-stranded DNA is the preferred (1000-fold >single-stranded) substrate. The high efficiency of double-stranded DNA as transformation substrate, in conjunction with strain-specific restriction endonucleases suggests a model of short-fragment recombination favoring closest relatives, consistent with the observed H. pylori population biology."
https://openalex.org/W2004371220,"In the current study, we investigated the role of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestins in δ-opioid receptor (DOR) signaling and trafficking by using a DOR mutant in which all Ser/Thr residues in the C terminus were mutated to Ala (DTS). We demonstrated that the DOR agonist d-[Pen2,Pen5]enkephalin could induce receptor internalization and adenylyl cyclase (AC) desensitization of DTS, but with comparatively slower kinetics than those observed with wild type DOR. Blockade of the internalization of DTS by the dominant-negative mutant dynamin, dynamin K44E, did not affect AC desensitization. However, depletion of β-arrestins almost totally blocked both internalization and AC desensitization of DTS. A BRET assay suggested that DOR phosphorylation promotes receptor selectivity for β-arrestin 2 over β-arrestin 1. Furthermore, in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lacking either β-arrestin 1 (βarr1–/–) or β-arrestin 2 (βarr2–/–), agonist-induced DTS desensitization and internalization were similar to that observed in wild type MEFs. In contrast, although DOR internalization decreased in both βarr1–/– MEFs and βarr2–/– MEFs, DPDPE-induced DOR desensitization was significantly reduced in βarr2–/– MEFs, but not in βarr1–/– MEFs. Additionally, the BRET assay suggested that depletion of phosphorylation did not influence the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex. Consistent with this observation, DTS did not recycle after internalization, which is like wild type DOR. Taken together, these results indicate that receptor phosphorylation confers DOR selectivity for β-arrestin 2 without affecting the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex and the fate of the internalized receptor.

The recruited arrestins promote uncoupling of the GPCRs (desensitization) from G proteins and subsequent internalization (also termed endocytosis or sequestration) via clathrin-coated pits (1Lefkowitz R.J.

Being a member of rhodopsin subfamily of GPCRs, the opioid receptor undergoes receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization upon agonist activation. Concrete demonstration of opioid receptor phosphorylation has long been reported for all three classes of opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ receptors (4Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 16Wang C. Zhou D. Cheng Z. Wei Q. Chen J. Li G. Pei G. Chi Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, a “brake mechanism” theory has been suggested, in which phosphorylation is required for the endocytosis of full-length DOR, but not for the carboxyl tail-truncated receptor (17Whistler J.L. Tsao P. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34331-34338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation-independent internalization of full-length DOR was reported recently (18Zhang X. Wang F. Chen X. Li J. Xiang B. Zhang Y-Q. Li B.-M Ma L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of phosphorylation in internalization and desensitization of DOR remains to be fully resolved. β-Arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 are ubiquitously expressed and are major regulators for most of the GPCRs. Although agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation has been demonstrated to be of great importance for arrestins binding (19Ferguson G. Watterson K.R. Palmer T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Gibson S.K. Parkes J.H. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5738-5749Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the ability of opioid receptors to recruit arrestins without being phosphorylated has been illustrated in MOR and DOR where the putative agonist-induced phosphorylation sites are removed or mutated (14Qiu Y.

Neurochem. 2005; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recently, the different roles of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 in the internalization of DOR have been suggested (18Zhang X. Wang F. Chen X. Li J. Xiang B. Zhang Y-Q. Li B.-M Ma L. J. Neurochem. 2005; 95: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, how the absence of receptor phosphorylation influences the binding property of the receptor to β-arrestins, and the regulatory profile of β-arrestins on phosphorylation-independent receptor signaling, are not well interpreted. Moreover, receptor phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in the intracellular fate of the internalized receptors. Overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 can increase the down-regulation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (21Pan L. Gurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11623-11632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Phosphatase inhibitors can prevent effective receptor recycling of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor (22Hsieh C. Brown S. Derleth C. Mackie K. J.

Class A GPCRs bind β-arrestins transiently and tend to recycle rapidly, whereas class B receptors form stable complexes with β-arrestins and tend to recycle slowly. Stable complexes between receptor and β-arrestin are shown to be determined by the phosphorylation of specific clusters of Ser and Thr residues in the carboxyl tail (26Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), in which depletion of phosphorylation reverses the internalized receptor from lysosome targeting to rapid recycling. In addition, a study using a “preactive” mutant of β-arrestins indicated that an unphosphorylated receptor forms a less stable complex with β-arrestin than a phosphoreceptor, and is more likely to recycle (21Pan L. Gurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11623-11632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DOR, exhibiting a high affinity for β-arrestins as compared with MOR (27Cen B. Xiong Y. Ma L. Pei G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), activates β-arrestins more efficiently (28Lowe J.D. Celver J.P. Gurevich V.V. Chavkin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15729-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and traffics to lysosome after endocytosis (29Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Hence, if observations with other GPCRs apply to the DOR function, then eliminating phosphorylation sites would destabilize the interaction between the receptor and β-arrestin, thus changing the eventual fate of the internalized receptor. Therefore, in our current study, we investigated the role of receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestins in DOR adenylyl cyclase (AC) signaling and trafficking. Our study demonstrated that full-length DOR could undergo phosphorylation-independent internalization and AC desensitization. In addition, the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex and the fate of the internalized receptor were not affected by the phosphorylation status. However, receptor phosphorylation affected DOR preference to β-arrestins, underlying the differential roles of β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 in the internalization and desensitization of opioid receptors. Materials—Plasmid encoding dynamin K44E (in pcDNA3 zeo(+)) was a gift from Dr. Mark von Zastrow (University of California, San Francisco, CA). β-Arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 tagged with GFP2 at the COOH terminus (in pEGFP-N1) were kindly provided by Dr. Mario Ascoli (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). GFP2 fusion protein expression vector (GFP2-C3) and DeepBlueC coelenterazine were from PerkinElmer Life Science. d-[Pen2,Pen5]Enkephalin (DPDPE) was supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin protein (HA) antibody (HA.11) was from Convance (Richmond, CA). Anti-β-arrestins1/2 antibody (SGODDA, 2004) was kindly provided by Dr. Martin Oppermann (University of Goöttingen, Goöttingen, Germany). Anti-GFP antibody was from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Alexa™-488 goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids and Adenovirus Construction—The construction of human influenza virus HA epitope-tagged mouse wild type δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and HA-tagged mutant DOR with all 7 Ser and Thr residues in the carboxyl tail mutated to Ala (DTS) in pcDNA3 has been described previously (30Kouhen O.M.-E. Wang G. Solberg J Erickson L.J. Law P.-Y Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For the construction of receptor-luciferase fusion proteins, a multisite mutation of HA-tagged mouse DOR and mutant DTS pcDNA3 plasmids was performed to insert an XbaI site after the coding sequence and to remove the stop codon using the QuikChange® multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Renilla luciferase coding sequence was amplified from pRL-null vector (Promega, Madison, WI), using sense and antisense primers harboring unique cloning sites (XbaI and ApaI). The PCR fragments were then inserted after DOR and DTS coding sequences to yield constructs that were named HA-DOR-Rluc and HA-DTS-Rluc. Construction of plasmids for GFP2-β-arrestin fusion proteins were carried out by digesting β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 coding sequences from their expression plasmids (in pEGFP-N1) with HindIII and ApaI, and then inserting them in-frame into GFP2-C3 vector to generate GFP2-β-arrestin 1 and GFP2-β-arrestin 2. Recombinant HA-tagged mouse DOR and DTS adenovirus was constructed using AdEasy™ adenoviral vector system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DOR and DTS in pcDNA3 were digested with Asp718 and XbaI and cloned into the pShuttle vector. Homologous recombination of the pShuttle vector with pAdEasy-1 vector in the BJ5183 cells was carried out as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasmids from the identified and isolated recombinants were digested with PacI before transfecting into HEK293 for virus production. Successful production of the virus was determined by opioid receptor binding of the cell pellets. Titer of the amplified virus was determined using the Adeno-X™ rapid titer kit (BD Biosciences). Transfection of HEK293 Cells—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The establishment of pools of stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing DOR or DTS has been described previously (30Kouhen O.M.-E. Wang G. Solberg J Erickson L.J. Law P.-Y Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), and experiments were performed 48 h after transfection. Infection of MEF Cells—Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines with or without β-arrestins were generously provided by Dr. Robert Lefkowitz (Duke University, Durham, NC). Five MEF cell lines were established (31Kohout T.A. Lin F-T. Perry S.J Conner D.A Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar): MEFs lacking β-arrestin 1 and its wild-type littermate controls WT1–7 MEFs; MEFs lacking β-arrestin 2 and its wild-type littermate controls WT-1 MEFs; MEFs lacking both β-arrestin 1 and 2; and WT-1 MEFs also served as its wild type controls. All MEFs were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For overexpression of DOR and DTS, MEF cells were infected with recombinant DOR or DTS adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection sufficient for expression of the receptor around 200–400 fmol/mg of protein. Determination of Receptor Internalization and Recycling by FACS Analysis—Receptor internalization was quantified by FACS analysis as previously described (14Qiu Y. Law P-Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36733-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, after incubation with 1 μm DPDPE for the indicated time intervals, cells were chilled on ice to terminate receptor trafficking, and cell surface receptors were visualized by incubating the cells with anti-HA antibody (1:1000), followed by incubation with the Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000). Surface receptor staining intensity of the antibody-labeled cells was analyzed using fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, BD Biosciences). For recycling experiments, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h. Then, DPDPE was added at 1 μm, and the cells were further treated for 30 min for DOR or 2 h for DTS. The cells were washed repeatedly to remove DPDPE, followed by incubation in agonist-free medium containing 10 μg/ml cycloheximide at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals before staining the cell surface receptors. Determination of Receptor Desensitization by Measurement of Intracellular cAMP Levels—Receptor desensitization was determined as previously described (14Qiu Y. Law P-Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36733-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to 1 μm DPDPE for the indicated time intervals. The medium was then removed and replaced with 100 μl of treatment buffer, with or without agonist. The treatment buffer consisted of 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and 10 μm forskolin in Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (KRHB; 110 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 55 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by heating the cells at 90 °C for 6 min. The cAMP level in the supernatant was measured by the AlphaScreen™ cAMP detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Science), as described previously (32Claude-Geppert P.A. Liu J. Solberg J. Erickson-Herbrandson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P-Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 313: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) Assay—HEK293 cells were co-transfected with constructs coding receptor-Rluc and GFP2 or GFP2-β-arrestin proteins. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Then, the cells were suspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% glucose + 0.01% CaCl2 + 0.01% MgCl2) and distributed into 96-well microplates (White Optiplate, PerkinElmer Life Science) at a density of 100,000 cells per well. The cells were warmed to 37 °C. DeepBlueC coelenterazine was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and 1 or 2 readings were collected. Vehicle or 1 μm DPDPE was then added and readings were taken for 10 min. The reading was performed using the Fusion-α system (Packard Bioscience) that allows the sequential reading of the signals detected in the 370–450- and 500–530-nm windows. The BRET signal was determined by the ratio of the light emitted by the GFP2 or GFP2-β-arrestin (500–530 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-Rluc (370–450 nm). The agonist-induced BRET ratio increase was calculated by subtracting the BRET ratio observed for vehicle-treated cells containing both Rluc and GFP2 or GFP2 fusion proteins from the ratio observed for the same cells treated with the agonist. Expression levels of receptors were determined by radioligand binding assay with [3H]diprenorphine. GFP2 and GFP2-β-arrestins transfected were determined by Western blot. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Either unpaired Student’s t test (two-tailed) or a one-way analysis of variance was performed for statistical comparisons. When analysis of variance was used and when this analysis indicated significance (p < 0.05), Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to determine which conditions were significantly different from the controls. Internalization and AC Desensitization of DTS—Phosphorylation of DOR at Thr358 and Ser363 residues within the carboxyl tail upon agonist activation has been reported (30Kouhen O.M.-E. Wang G. Solberg J Erickson L.J. Law P.-Y Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 33Guo J. Wu Y. Zhang W. Zhao J. Devi L.A. Pei G. Ma L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), where Ser363 is the primary phosphorylation site. Our previous study with a mutation of Ser363 of DOR suggested that DOR could undergo phosphorylation-independent internalization and AC desensitization (12Law P-Y. Kouhen O. M.-E. Solberg J. Wang W. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32057-32065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a brake mechanism theory has been put forward that suggests that phosphorylation is required for the endocytosis of full-length DOR (17Whistler J.L. Tsao P. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34331-34338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility of undetectable phosphorylation of other Ser and Thr residues at the carboxyl tail, a mutant of DOR with all Ser and Thr residues within the carboxyl tail mutated to Ala (designated as DTS), which fails to show any detectable phosphorylation under agonist treatment (30Kouhen O.M.-E. Wang G. Solberg J Erickson L.J. Law P.-Y Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was used to further investigate the role of receptor phosphorylation in full-length DOR desensitization and internalization. Receptor internalization evaluated by FACS analyses showed that 1 μm DPDPE treatment could cause internalization of phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptor DTS, although the rate was slower than that of DOR (Fig. 1A). The half-life (t½) of DTS internalization was 3.4 ± 1.3 h, whereas DOR internalized with t½ = 0.40 ± 0.55 h. The levels of DOR and DTS being internalized after 6 h of agonist exposure were 87 ± 2.2 and 73 ± 0.68%, respectively. When the desensitization kinetics of DOR and DTS were compared, the ability of DPDPE to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production was measured in cells pretreated with DPDPE for the indicated time intervals. It showed that DTS desensitized much more slowly than DOR in the presence of 1 μm DPDPE, reaching the maximum of 44 ± 1.4% at 6 h, suggesting that the t½ was >6 h (Fig. 1B). DOR desensitized faster with t½ = 0.80 ± 0.08 h, and almost totally desensitized after 4 h of agonist pretreatment (Fig. 1B). These data conform to our previous results with DOR-S363A and indicate that unphosphorylated DTS still can undergo receptor internalization and AC desensitization after pretreatment with agonist, but with slower kinetics. Effect of Dominant-negative Dynamin on Internalization and AC Desensitization of DTS—Internalization and desensitization are two independent but related processes. The observed slower desensitization of DTS may be due to slower internalization. Thus, we used a dominant-negative dynamin, dynamin K44E, a mutant shown to inhibit the internalization of receptor, to block the internalization of DOR and DTS. As shown in Fig. 2A, dynamin K44E significantly inhibited the internalization of both DOR and DTS. However, dynamin K44E did not significantly alter the ability of either DOR or DTS to desensitize after agonist activation (Fig. 2B), suggesting that internalization contributes little to desensitization of either wild type DOR or mutant DTS. The Role of β-Arrestins in the Internalization and AC Desensitization of DTS—β-Arrestins are key elements in terminating receptor signaling, and act as scaffolding proteins in coupling GPCRs to clathrin-coated vesicles (34Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 35Goodman O.B. Krupnick J.G.

To further characterize the observed internalization and desensitization of DTS, the role of β-arrestins in phosphorylation-independent internalization and desensitization was examined. MEF cells lacking both β-arrestin 1 and β-arrestin 2 (βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– MEF) were employed. As shown in Fig. 3A, 1 μm DPDPE-induced internalization of wild type DOR was markedly blocked in βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– cells, with only 20 ± 3.5% of the receptor internalized after 6 h of incubation. In contrast, 80 ± 1.5% of DOR was internalized after 6 h of agonist treatment in corresponding wild type MEFs (WT-1). These data confirm that the internalization of DOR is mainly β-arrestin-dependent. Similar to wild type DOR, most of DTS remained at the cell surface of βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– MEFs upon agonist treatment, with only 11 ± 4.4% of the receptor internalized, whereas the internalization was not blocked in WT-1 MEFs (64 ± 8.2%, Fig. 3A). A similar approach was used to examine the AC desensitization profile of wild type DOR and DTS in βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– MEFs. As depicted in Fig. 3B, 6 h of treatment with 1 μm DPDPE on DOR-expressing βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– MEFs only desensitized the receptor by 18 ± 4.0%, whereas agonist-induced desensitization of DOR in WT-1 MEFs reached 75 ± 5.1% after 6 h of incubation. For the phosphorylation-deficient mutant DTS, similar characteristics of agonist-induced desensitization were observed. Fig. 3B also shows that lacking both β-arrestins strongly inhibited the desensitization of DTS, with only 14 ± 2.7% receptor desensitization observed after treating βarr1–/–/βarr2–/– MEFs with 1 μm DPDPE for 6 h. Whereas DTS in WT-1 MEFs showed 58 ± 6.6% loss of DPDPE ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production after 6 h of agonist exposure. Taken together, these findings indicate that phosphorylation-independent internalization and desensitization of DOR, like wild type DOR, are β-arrestin-dependent processes. However, the small amount of DOR internalized in MEFs lacking both β-arrestins suggests DOR may undergo internalization through other pathway(s). The Interaction of β-Arrestins with DTS—We next examined the ability of β-arrestins to interact with DTS upon agonist treatment, using BRET assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The expression levels of luciferase-tagged receptors were controlled to be within 10% difference (Fig. 4B). The GFP and GFP-β-arrestins were blotted with anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B) and quantified to be at about the same level (data not shown). DPDPE induced rapid and sustained interaction of wild type DOR with β-arrestins 1 and 2 (Fig. 4A). More interestingly, DOR showed a stronger association with β-arrestin 2 than with β-arrestin 1; the difference was significant after 4 min of treatment with DPDPE (p < 0.05). The plateau value of DPDPE-induced BRET ratio increase for DOR and β-arrestin 2 was 0.026 ± 0.001, whereas for DOR and β-arrestin 1, it was 0.014 ± 0.003 (p < 0.05). DPDPE also induced a prolonged interaction of unphosphorylated DTS withβ-arrestins 1 and 2. The interaction profiles of DTS with bothβ-arrestins were similar to that of DOR withβ-arrestin 1 (Fig. 4A, p > 0.05). The plateau values of DPDPE"

The purine degradation pathway has an essential role in nitrogen metabolism in most organisms. In this catabolism pathway, inosine monophosphate, which is the final product of de novo purine biosynthesis, is degraded through sequential enzymatic steps into uric acid, which contains a high level of nitrogen (1Smith P.M.C. Atkins C.A. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Most organisms, including some bacteria, plants, and animals, utilize a common pathway for uric acid metabolism and produce stereospecific (S)-allantoin as the final product (2Atkins C.A.

Subsequently, (S)-allantoin, which contains an even ratio of nitrogen to carbon, is used as a nitrogen source through further enzyme-dependent degradation. This metabolism of uric acid, a process named the ureide pathway, has a pivotal role in transforming the nitrogen that is fixed in leguminous plants (2Atkins C.A. Smith P.M.C.

Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The third enzyme, OHCU decarboxylase, was identified through the phylogenetic analysis of a whole genome and has been shown to catalyze the decarboxylation of OHCU, producing the stereospecific (S)-allantoin (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the previous identification of two chemically distinct labile intermediates produced by urate oxidase (9Kahn K. Serfozo P. Tipton P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5435-5442Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar) but differ in that racemic allantoin is produced in the nonenzymatic decomposition of HIU (10Sarma A.D. Serfozo P. Kahn K. Tipton P.A.

Because the three enzymes in the pathway, produced from individual genes, are present in most organisms, the proteins belong to a large family of enzymes. However, Arabidopsis thaliana and Bacillus subtilis possess a bifunctional enzyme in which two of the three enzymes are fused into a single polypeptide (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R.

However, the biochemical characteristics of OHCU decarboxylase are still unknown, except for the findings that the enzyme is unrelated in sequence to other known decarboxylases and has been implicated in regulating plant growth by interacting with a component of the brassinosteroid receptor (17Nam K.H. Li J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2406-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), indicative of its unusual structural and functional properties. In this study, we identified novel structural and functional features of the A. thaliana and B. subtilis OHCU decarboxylases. Given the sequence similarities of OHCU decarboxylases from many organisms, other members of this family in prokaryotes and eukaryotes likely function similarly to the proposed mechanism. Protein Purification and Crystallization—For the expression of His-tagged recombinant A. thaliana OHCU decarboxylase, a portion of the cDNA (483 bp; residues 1–161) encoding the A. thaliana bifunctional enzyme was amplified using two sequence-specific primers (Table 1). The PCR product was inserted between the NdeI and BamHI sites of a version of pET28 (Novagen) that had been modified to contain a tobacco etch virus cleavage site between the N-terminal His tag and the multiple cloning site. Subsequently, Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3) harboring the plasmid for A. thaliana OHCU decarboxylase was grown at 37 °C in LB and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 16 h at 20 °C. The cells were harvested and sonicated in buffer A (100 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.6). The N-terminal His-tagged enzyme was purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with buffer B (buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole) followed by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200, GE Healthcare) with buffer A, and subsequently concentrated to ∼4 mg/ml. Selenomethionine-substituted protein was prepared as above except that the constructed plasmid was transformed into E. coli B834(DE3) methionine auxotroph cells (Novagen). Crystallization was performed using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method at 22 °C. Crystals of OHCU decarboxylase were produced using the selenomethionine-substituted protein in the presence of 20 mm racemic allantoin with a crystallization buffer of 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, and 16% polyacrylic acid 5100.TABLE 1DNA sequences for the primers used in these studies Restriction sites used for cloning are underlined, and the underlined-boldface characters show the mutated sequences.Gene sourceSequence (5′ → 3′)A. thaliana decarboxylaseForward primer for cloningGGAATTCCATATGGCGATGGAGATCGGAGAAGReverse primer for cloningGCGGATCCCTACTTATCGGAGAACAGCTTTGB. subtilis decarboxylaseForward primer for H68A mutantCAAAAAGGCTCCCCGGCTCGGReverse primer for H68A mutantCCGAGCCGGGGAGCCTTTTTGForward primer for E84A mutantGGTACGAGCTCAGCAGAACGCReverse primer for E84A mutantGCGTTCTGCTGAGCTCGTACCForward primer for R158A mutantGCCCGCTTTGCTCTGGCTGACReverse primer for R158A mutantGTCAGCCAGAGCAAAGCGGGC Open table in a new tab Data Collection and Structure Determination—Multiwavelength anomalous and single-wavelength diffraction data to 2.7 and 2.5 Å, respectively, were collected on beamlines 4A and 6C at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Pohang, Korea) using crystals of selenomethionine OHCU decarboxylase complexed with 20 mm allantoin. Data were collected at 100 K, and the crystals were cryoprotected by adding 20% glycerol to the crystallization solution. The collected data were processed using HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The identification of five selenium sites was sufficient to trace most of the residues, excluding residues 1–5 and 66–78. Manual model building was performed using O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

Urate oxidase from Candida sp. was purchased from Sigma. A gene encoding the mutation site in OHCU decarboxylase (residues 1–170) was generated by PCR using specifically designed primers (Table 1), and the sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed as N-terminal His-tagged proteins and purified as described above for the wild-type and mutant OHCU decarboxylases and as described previously for HIU hydrolase (14Jung D-K. Lee Y. Park S.G. Park B.C. Kim G.-H. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9790-9795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was concentrated to ∼1.0 mg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for the wild-type and mutant OHCU decarboxylases, and ∼1.0 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 200 mm NaCl for HIU hydrolase. CD measurements were performed at 30 °C in a 10-mm path-length cuvette with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Uric acid (50 μm) in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6, was incubated in the cuvette with urate oxidase (1 unit) and HIU hydrolase (4.0 μg), and once OHCU reached its maximal concentration, OHCU decarboxylase (4.0 μg) was added. Rate constants for the decay of OHCU were obtained by fitting curves at 257 nm to a model of exponential decay by a first-order reaction (SigmaPlot). The formation of allantoin in the presence of the three enzymes of the ureide pathway was measured in the range of 200–360 nm at specified incubation times. Overall Structure of OHCU Decarboxylase—The OHCU decarboxylase of A. thaliana consists of the N-terminal 161 residues of a bifunctional enzyme fused with HIU hydrolase (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 17Nam K.H. Li J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2406-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The enzyme was crystallized in the presence of racemic allantoin as a P3121 space group with one monomer in an asymmetric unit. In the crystal, dimerization was observed between two crystallographic symmetry-related monomers, consistent with size-exclusion chromatography results, which predicted that the enzyme exists as a homodimer. Fig. 2A shows the structure of the dimer, in which the crystallographic 2-fold axis coincides with the molecular 2-fold axis running perpendicularly to the plane of the figure. Except for highly disordered regions, including residues 1–5 and 66–78, monomeric OHCU decarboxylase folds largely into α-helices, representing an unprecedented structure based on DALI searches (the highest Z score of 2.3) (24Home L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Overall structure of OHCU decarboxylase. A, a ribbon representation of a dimer is shown with the bound (S)-allantoin in a stick model. Each monomer is presented in a different color and labeled with the corresponding secondary structure. B, a close-up view of the N-terminal domain of the monomer is displayed in stereo view. The core consists of the conserved hydrophobic residues. C, the interactions mediated mainly by the hydrophobic residues are shown for the C-terminal domain. For clarity, some residues and/or labels are not included in these figures. See the text for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The L-shaped monomer contains two distinct domains, composed of two layers of α-helices and oriented at ∼90° relative to each other. The N-terminal domain consists of helices 1–4 and the C-terminal region of helix 8. Four geometrically adjacent helices, numbered 1–3 and 8, are arranged in an anti-parallel manner, such that the overall architecture of the four helices is largely reminiscent of a four-helix bundle (Fig. 2B). Hydrophobic residues, including Trp-10, Phe-19, Ala-20, Ile-35, Ala-38, Ile-41, Trp-42, Ala-142, Ala-143, and Phe-158, create a hydrophobic core in the center of the bundle, consistent with other known four-helix bundles. Helix 4, which is perpendicular to the four-helix bundle, further stabilizes this arrangement by providing the additional hydrophobic residues Val-46, Trp-51, and Phe-55 in the hydrophobic core. The residues that form the hydrophobic core are conserved for the hydrophobic properties in the OHCU decarboxylase family (Fig. 1), and their side chains are largely or completely buried in the core, as predicted on the basis of the accessible area calculated by the program AREAIMOL in CCP4 (23Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Helices 5–7 and the N-terminal region of helix 8 are in the C-terminal domain. Two parallel helices, numbered 6 and 7, are also stabilized by the continuous hydrophobic interactions along the helices with the conserved residues Ala-92, Ile-96, Trp-99, Tyr-103, Phe-107, Phe-109, Phe-111, Leu-124, Leu-127, and Tyr-131 (Fig. 2C). Helix 5, which is in a position almost perpendicular to helices 6 and 7, caps the N-terminal regions of these two helices. The 24-residue helix 8 is intercalated between the two domains and stabilizes the perpendicular orientations of the domains, mainly by hydrophobic interactions. In the dimeric conformation, the dimer interface of 1500 Å2 of buried surface area mainly consists of interactions between the side chains and the backbone atoms of the two domains of each monomer. Active Site—The active site in each monomer, which was identified by the binding of allantoin, is located at the cleft between the two domains. Although the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of racemic allantoin, the observed density for the bound allantoin corresponds to an (S)-form, consistent with the stereospecificity of OHCU decarboxylase. The active site is enclosed by several structural segments from the two domains that contain the highly conserved residues of the OHCU decarboxylase family (Fig. 3A). Loops between helices 4 and 5, although partly missing in the current structure, and between helices 6 and 7 are primary elements of the top and bottom of the pocket, respectively, which is directly lined on both sides by the completely buried hydrophobic residues Ile-61, Ile-112, Ala-115, and Ile-149. Hydrophilic residues of the two domains, including His-58, Glu-80, and Arg-153, also contribute side chains to the active site. Therefore, the bound (S)-allantoin is embedded in a hydrophobic environment but is covered with these hydrophilic residues on the surface of the pocket. The active site contains no indications of any electron density for cofactor(s) or metals, distinguishing this enzyme mechanistically from other cofactor-dependent decarboxylases (25Liu A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10407-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Possible hydrogen bonds between the bound (S)-allantoin and the active site residues are mainly mediated by atoms of the main chain of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). In particular, N6, O7, and N8 at the 5-ureido group of (S)-allantoin form hydrogen bonds exclusively with either the backbone carbonyl oxygen or nitrogen. In addition, N1 and O2 interact within 3.1 Å with the carbonyl oxygen of Ile-113 and the main-chain nitrogen of Ala-115, respectively. Four residues, including Ile-61, Ile-112, Ala-115, and Ile-149, also mediate extensive hydrophobic interactions within4Åofthe bound (S)-allantoin. In contrast to these nonspecific interactions, specific interactions are present that may be related to the stereospecificity of the reaction. The residues His-58, Glu-80, and Arg-153, the invariant residues in the family (Fig. 1), are the only amino acids whose side chains interact directly with the bound (S)-allantoin. These interactions are unusual in that all three side chains are localized 3.0–4.2 Å from the O4 of (S)-allantoin, with the exception of a 2.9-Å hydrogen bond between N3 of (S)-allantoin and Oɛ1 of Glu-80 (Fig. 3B). In addition to interacting with (S)-allantoin, Glu-80 and Arg-153 perform other structural roles in the active site. The side-chain carboxylate of Glu-80 forms bidentate hydrogen bonds of 3.0 Å with the side chain of Arg-153, bridging the N- and C-terminal domains. The resulting extended conformations of these side chains serve as a lid to the active site, effectively sequestering (S)-allantoin from the solvent (Fig. 3A). The production of (S)-allantoin by OHCU decarboxylase requires the removal of the carboxylate group from C4 and protonation at the re-face of C5 in OHCU (Scheme 1). Inspection of the active site revealed that His-58 can fulfill the stereochemical requirements for (S)-allantoin formation, in both distance and orientation. Unlike Glu-80 and Arg-153, His-58 is the only possible proton donor within 4.0 Å of C5, and moreover is located at the re-face of C5 in OHCU, based on the observed (S)-allantoin conformation (Fig. 3A). In particular, Nδ1 of His-58, which is 3.0 Å from O4 in (S)-allantoin, is not only proximal to C5 at a distance of 3.7 Å but also shows enhanced basicity due to the possible 2.7-Å hydrogen bond between the side-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln-146 and Nɛ2 of His-58 (Fig. 3C). Functional Analysis of OHCU Decarboxylase—To investigate the roles of the proposed catalytic residue His-58 and the two nearby residues Glu-80 and Arg-153, we measured the enzyme activity of the wild-type OHCU decarboxylase and mutants of the enzyme that are altered at one of three residues. Because some of the A. thaliana enzymes exhibit solubility problems, in particular the bifunctional enzyme that has both OHCU decarboxylase and HIU hydrolase activities, the HIU hydrolase and OHCU decarboxylase from B. subtilis (7Lee Y. Lee D.H. Kho C.W. Lee A.Y. Jang M. Cho S. Lee C.H. Lee J.S. Myung P.K. Park B.C. Park S.G. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4769-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Jung D-K. Lee Y. Park S.G. Park B.C. Kim G.-H. Rhee S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9790-9795Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were used in this experiment. The residues His-58, Glu-80, and Arg-153 in the A. thaliana enzyme are equivalent to His-68, Glu-84, and Arg-158 in the B. subtilis OHCU decarboxylase, respectively (Fig. 1). In CD measurements, optically active HIU, OHCU, and (S)-allantoin exhibit unique CD spectra in the region of 210–360 nm (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Given that the conversion of OHCU into (S)-allantoin is catalyzed by OHCU decarboxylase, we first selectively monitored the decay of OHCU in a time course by measuring CD signals at 257 nm, at which wavelength only OHCU shows noticeable ellipticity (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows CD spectra of the decay of OHCU and the formation of (S)-allantoin over time. In the absence of OHCU decarboxylase, OHCU produced by the consecutive reactions of urate oxidase and HIU hydrolase underwent nonenzymatic degradation with a rate constant of 1.8 × 10-3 s-1 at 30 °C, which is comparable to the previously published value of 1.2 × 10-3 s-1 at 25 °C (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The presence of the wild-type OHCU decarboxylase, along with the other two enzymes, caused a rapid decomposition of OHCU, and thus there were no appreciable changes in the ellipticity at 257 nm. However, in a reaction containing the OHCU decarboxylase H68A mutant at 4 μg/ml, OHCU slowly disappeared with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 5.8 × 10-3 s-1. This rate of OHCU decay is only three times greater than that of the nonenzymatic spontaneous decay and those of the E84A and R158A mutants under identical experimental conditions (see below), indicating that a mutation at His-68 eliminates the enzyme activity. In the presence of the E84A and R158A mutant enzymes (Fig. 4A), the decomposition of OHCU, with rate constants of 2.0 × 10-3 s-1 and 1.8 × 10-3 s-1, respectively, was almost identical to that in the absence of OHCU decarboxylase, suggesting that these two mutant enzymes are essentially inactive and the observed decay of OHCU is due to nonenzymatic decomposition. The formation of (S)-(+)-allantoin was also measured using the various OHCU decarboxylase forms. In the presence of all three enzymes, including the wild-type OHCU decarboxylase, the CD spectrum corresponding to (S)-(+)-allantoin appeared within 3 min and remained stable (Fig. 4B). However, in the presence of the OHCU decarboxylase H68A mutant, the addition of uric acid produced a spectrum corresponding to OHCU within 3 min of the reaction, but after 8 min the spectrum disappeared and the (S)-(+)-allantoin spectrum did not appear. This result indicates that through the completion of the reaction, no optically active substances were produced. Furthermore, in reactions with the E84A or R158A mutant enzymes, the OHCU spectrum was observed upon the addition of uric acid but gradually disappeared over time, and no optically active substances were observed after 25 min of reaction time (Fig. 4C). The absence of optically active substances in the presence of a mutant OHCU decarboxylase, even though the OHCU was apparently degraded, could be due to the formation of a racemic mixture of allantoin. In an uncatalyzed reaction in which the spontaneous decay of OHCU was monitored, a racemic mixture of allantoin was produced, with (S)- and (R)-allantoin showing mirror image CD spectra in the 200–240 nm region (8Ramazzina I. Folli C. Secchi A. Berni R. Percudani R. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These data on the kinetics of OHCU decomposition and the formation of (S)-(+)-allantoin suggest that a mutation at the proposed catalytic residue His-68 in the B. subtilis enzyme essentially inactivated the OHCU decarboxylase activity and caused a significant slowing in the rate of decay of OHCU while eliminating the stereospecificity of the enzyme. Other mutations at Glu-84 and Arg-158 also abolished the enzyme activity, possibly by impairing their catalytic roles or the binding affinity of the substrate to the enzyme. We have presented structural and functional evidence that OHCU decarboxylase, an enzyme of the ureide pathway, contains a novel helical structural fold and is a cofactor-independent enzyme. This is only the second demonstration of a direct decarboxylation by a decarboxylating enzyme. Our structural and functional analyses of OHCU decarboxylase revealed that histidine, glutamate, and arginine in the hydrophobic active site (His-58, Glu-80, and Arg-153 in A. thaliana and His-68, Glu-84, and Arg-158 in B. subtilis in these studies) are the only residues that interact directly through their side chains with the product. In addition, these residues play essential roles in catalysis, specifically in the stereospecificity and/or the affinity of the ligand for the enzyme. These proposed functional roles are substantiated by the conservation of the residues in members of the OHCU decarboxylase family (Fig. 1) and by structural differences in the binding mode of (S)-allantoin in OHCU decarboxylase and urate oxidase. In particular, the binding environment of (S)-allantoin in OHCU decarboxylase sharply contrasts with that captured in the active site of urate oxidase, which was initially revealed by crystallization of the enzyme in the presence of uric acid, during which HIU produced in the crystallization process decomposed into allantoin in a nonenzymatic manner. Unexpectedly, (S)-allantoin was observed to bind selectively in the active site of urate oxidase (26Gabison L. Chiadmi M. Colloc'h N. Castro B. El Hajji M. Prangé T. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2087-2091Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of urate oxidase complexed with (S)-allantoin, the five-member ring of (S)-allantoin lacks specific interactions with the side chains of active site residues but instead shows nonspecific interactions with nearby water molecules, providing structural differentiation between the enzymatic (stereospecific) reaction in OHCU decarboxylase and the nonenzymatic (nonstereospecific) reaction in urate oxidase. On the basis of the structural and functional analyses of OHCU decarboxylase, we propose a mechanism for (S)-allantoin formation (Scheme 2). The active sites of most decarboxylating enzymes bind metals or other cofactors, which function to activate decarboxylation and stabilize the carbanion upon the elimination of CO2 from the substrate (25Liu A. Zhang H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 10407-10411Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 27Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The absence of cofactors or metals in the active site of OHCU decarboxylase leads us to postulate that the decarboxylation reaction occurs directly. This type of direct decarboxylation is unusual but has been extensively characterized in orotidine 5′-monophosphate (OMP) decarboxylase, the only enzyme of this class discovered to date, in which decarboxylation and protonation occur at the same C6 carbon of orotidine. In OMP decarboxylase, the substrate carboxylate group was suggested to form unfavorable electrostatic interactions with the side-chain carboxylate of an active site aspartate residue, thereby destabilizing the substrate carboxylate and facilitating a decarboxylation reaction. However, the binding environment of the substrate OMP to the enzyme indicates that the resulting negative charge cannot be delocalized into the pyrimidine ring (27Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Decarboxylation and protonation in OMP decarboxylase is therefore a concerted event in which protonation is mediated by a nearby lysine residue (27Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Miller B.G. Wolfenden R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 847-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Further mutational studies have indicated that a mutation at this aspartate abolishes enzyme activity, consistent with the proposed catalytic role of this residue (29Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Wolfenden R. Short S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15174-15176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the features of the OHCU decarboxylase reaction differ from those of the OMP decarboxylase, in that decarboxylation at C4 and protonation at C5 are separated, and more importantly, that the carbanion can be stabilized by using the double bond between C5 and N1 as an electron sink. From a stereochemical perspective, these two events cannot occur in a concerted mode, but must occur in the order of decarboxylation and then protonation. On the basis of a bound (S)-allantoin, a substrate carboxylate was modeled on an sp3 C4 of OHCU with two possible orientations, toward either His-58 or Gln-81. Given the cavity in the region between (S)-allantoin and Gln-81 (Fig. 3A), the substrate carboxylate fits better into the orientation toward Gln-81, suggesting that OHCU favors the (S)-configuration at C4, with the hydroxyl group at C4 locating toward His-58 (Scheme 1). In this modeled OHCU, Glu-80 is the only negatively charged residue in the vicinity (∼4 Å) of the modeled substrate carboxylate on OHCU, implying that Glu-80 could play a catalytic role for a decarboxylation, analogous to the aspartate in OMP decarboxylase. However, geometrically its side chain is not oriented toward a substrate carboxylate but instead points away from OHCU (Fig. 3A). In OMP decarboxylase, two carboxylate groups lie almost in the same plane, with a head-to-head orientation (27Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 508-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Changes in torsion angle χ1 of Glu-80 might place the side chain carboxylate in a more optimal orientation for a decarboxylation reaction, although this proposed movement would make the reaction intermediate vulnerable to solvent by opening the active site. Thus, although this mechanism cannot be ruled out, it seems unlikely that a mechanistic analogy to OMP decarboxylase can be extended to OHCU decarboxylase. An alternative proposal for direct decarboxylation by OHCU decarboxylase is based on the hydrophobic features of the active site, which may cause considerable destabilization of the carboxylate group on OHCU. This relatively simple postulate is supported by sequence conservation, in that the hydrophobic residues in the active site of the A. thaliana enzyme are highly conserved in the members of the OHCU decarboxylase family (Figs. 1 and 3A). These structural considerations, along with the identical functional results from the E84A and R158A mutants of the B. subtilis enzyme (Fig. 4), suggest that Glu-80 does not participate directly in a decarboxylation reaction but instead is involved in closing the active site in a concerted movement together with Arg-153 (Fig. 3A). Unlike the wild-type enzyme, in which these two residues are thought to sequester the bound OHCU from the solvent, the mutant enzymes may be unable to enclose the active site effectively, allowing the degradation of OHCU in a nonenzymatic manner. Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements have been made to determine whether the mutations have an effect on the binding of a ligand to OHCU decarboxylase, with a stable allantoin as the ligand. However, due to the extremely low binding affinity of allantoin to the enzymes, even with an excess molar ratio of ligand to enzyme (data not shown), no firm conclusion could be made. Therefore, decisive roles for Glu-80 and Arg-153 in direct decarboxylation require further investigation. Upon the elimination of CO2 from OHCU, the resulting negative charge on C4 could be delocalized through the conjugated π electron system in the substrate and the protonation of N1; although the proton donor to N1 is not clear of the structure, the environment around N1 suggests that it is protonated (Fig. 3B). Subsequently, the unprotonated Nδ1 of His-58, with its enhanced basicity, may be involved in deprotonating the hydroxyl group at C4 from the re-face of C5 in OHCU. This stereochemistry allows the scissile σ bond to be perpendicular to the plane of the π electron system of a possible transition state, gaining delocalization energy with a maximum σ-π overlap. Finally, protonation at the sp2 C5 on the same side is presumably achieved by the protonated Nδ1 of His-58, producing a stereospecific (S)-allantoin. This proposed proton transfer by His-58 is supported by the stereochemical considerations of OHCU, in which the hydroxyl group of the imidazoline ring appears to be on the re-face of C5. Proton transfer in enzyme catalysis has been well characterized in the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase reaction, where the Nζ of lysine carries out the 1,3-prototropic shift of a proton in the external aldimine, resulting in a ketimine intermediate (30Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This proposal is consistent with the structural and functional results obtained in the present study, as well as with the conservations of a histidine residue in the active site, e.g. His-58 in A. thaliana and His-68 in B. subtilis. This histidine residue is the only candidate for protonating the re-face of the prochiral trigonal center C5, and thus a mutation of this histidine residue abolishes the enzyme activity and stereospecificity of the allantoin that is produced. We note the recent publication of Zanotti et al. (32Cendron L. Berni R. Folli C. Ramazzina I. Percudani R. Zanotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18182-18189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) describing the crystal structure of this enzyme from zebrafish. Although the tertiary structures of the enzymes in their monomeric forms are essentially identical, the two OHCU decarboxylases differ with respect to quaternary structure and the stereoisomer of the bound allantoin. The relative orientations of the two monomers are different in these homodimeric structures, and (R)-allantoin is observed in the active site of the zebrafish enzyme, unlike the binding of (S)-allantoin in the active site of A. thaliana shown in the present study, which is consistent with the stereospecificity of the enzyme. Also a mechanism for direct decarboxylation that is analogous to that of OMP decarboxylase has been postulated. We thank Drs S. G. Park and Y. Lee (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Korea) for providing cDNAs used in this study and Dr. K. Kim (Sungkyunkwan University, Korea) for the CD experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2065240767,"Secretion of saliva to aid swallowing and digestion is an important physiological function found in many vertebrates and invertebrates. Pavlov reported classical conditioning of salivation in dogs a century ago. Conditioning of salivation, however, has been so far reported only in dogs and humans, and its underlying neural mechanisms remain elusive because of the complexity of the mammalian brain. We previously reported that, in cockroaches Periplaneta americana, salivary neurons that control salivation exhibited increased responses to an odor after conditioning trials in which the odor was paired with sucrose solution. However, no direct evidence of conditioning of salivation was obtained. In this study, we investigated the effects of conditioning trials on the level of salivation. Untrained cockroaches exhibited salivary responses to sucrose solution applied to the mouth but not to peppermint or vanilla odor applied to an antenna. After differential conditioning trials in which an odor was paired with sucrose solution and another odor was presented without pairing with sucrose solution, sucrose-associated odor induced an increase in the level of salivation, but the odor presented alone did not. The conditioning effect lasted for one day after conditioning trials. This study demonstrates, for the first time, classical conditioning of salivation in species other than dogs and humans, thereby providing the first evidence of sophisticated neural control of autonomic function in insects. The results provide a useful model system for studying cellular basis of conditioning of salivation in the simpler nervous system of insects."

Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2003; 16: 501-506PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ryu H. Ferrante R.J. Expert Opin. Emerg. Drugs. 2005; 10: 345-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 4Di Prospero N.A. Fischbeck K.H. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 756-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most of these targets have been identified by looking at disease mechanisms triggered by gain of function defects caused by mutant huntingtin (5Sipione S. Cattaneo E. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 21-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and we and other groups have hypothesized that diminished wild-type huntingtin function may also contribute to the pathogenesis of HD (6Cattaneo E. Zuccato C. Tartari M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). This suggests that a complementary approach based on identifying compounds that mimic wild-type huntingtin activity should be considered: the administration of novel compounds capable of restoring wild-type huntingtin function, together with drugs reducing mutant huntingtin toxicity, may be an optimal therapeutic strategy. The repressor element 1/neuron restrictive silencer element (RE1/NRSE) was the first example of an affected target of wild-type huntingtin activity to be discovered and is a silencer of gene expression (7Mori N.

Bioinformatic studies indicate that more than 1000 neuronal genes in the human genome bear an RE1/NRSE sequence in their promoters (10Bruce A.W. Donaldson I.J. Wood I.C. Yerbury S.A. Sadowski M.I.

We have previously shown that wild-type huntingtin stimulates BDNF gene transcription (12Zuccato C. Ciammola A. Rigamonti D. Leavitt B.R. Goffredo D. Conti L. MacDonald M.E. Friedlander R.M. Silani V. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Sipione S. Cattaneo E.

Mutant huntingtin is less capable of recruiting REST/NRSF in the cytoplasm, which leads to its pathological translocation to the nucleus and increased occupancy of its cognate RE1/NRSE genomic loci (13Zuccato C.

In HD, the occupied RE1/NRSE silences transcription from RE1/NRSE-regulated genes, thus contributing to neuronal dysfunction (13Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L.

Interest in compounds acting on a transcriptional system that supports the transcription of the BDNF gene (among others) is sustained by the fact that positive outcomes have been observed in HD models after increasing BDNF levels by means of transplanting cells engineered to overexpress BDNF into a chemical model of HD (15Perez-Navarro E. Canudas A.M. Akerund P. Alberch J. Arenas E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) or delivering BDNF via gene therapy (16Kells A.P. Fong D.M. Dragunow M.

Transgenic overexpression of BDNF in the cerebral cortex can delay the progression of disease phenotypes in the R6/1 HD mouse model carrying the first 63 amino acids of mutant human huntingtin protein (18Xu G. Gharami K. Russel T. 277.17/MM3 Neuroscience. 2006; Google Scholar), and the genetic reduction of BDNF in the same R6/1 mice causes a worse phenotype (19Canals J.M. Pineda J.R. Torres-Peraza J.F.

Furthermore, these findings are paralleled by the fact that mice lacking cortical BDNF show a hind limb clasping phenotype similar to that observed in mouse models of HD (20Baquet Z.C. Gorski J.A. Jones K.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4250-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been more recently demonstrated that cystamine improves the HD phenotype in mice by enhancing BDNF release from the Golgi compartment in brain cells (21Borrell-Pages M. Canals J.M. Cordelieres F.P. Parker J.A. Pineda J.R. Grange G. Bryson E.A. Guillermier M. Hirsch E. Hantraye P. Cheetham M.E. Neri C. Alberch J. Brouillet E. Saudou F. Humbert S. J. Clin.

We here describe the development of the first cell-based assay designed to screen for compounds that are potentially capable of restoring the loss of wild-type huntingtin function in RE1/NRSE-mediated gene transcription by identifying genetic and chemical RE1/NRSE modulators. We used this assay to identify some small molecules that inhibit RE1/NRSE activity and then assessed their efficacy on molecular and phenotype parameters in HD cellular models. Transcription Factor and Reporter Gene Constructs—The RE1/NRSEbdnf-LUC reporter construct was constructed using the enhanced luciferase reporter gene pGL3-promoter (Promega, Madison, WI) as a backbone. A 300-bp portion of the rat BDNF promoter exon II containing the RE1/NRSE sequence was obtained from the BDNF+II CAT construct (41Timmusk T. Lendahl U. Funakoshi H. Arenas E. Persson H. Metsis M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and subcloned into the Xho-HindIII digested pGL3-promoter from which SV40 was excised. The same cloning strategy was used for the mutated RE1/NRSEbdnf-LUC. The 300-bp insert was obtained from the BDNFI+IImut CAT construct (42Timmusk T. Palm K. Lendahl U. Metsis M. J. Biol.

Cell Cultures, Engineering, and Antibiotic Selection—ST14A and STHdhQ111/HdhQ111 cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 33 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (43Cattaneo E. Conti L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 223-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For the transient transfection experiments, the harvested ST14A cells were resuspended in electroporation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at a density of 625,000 cells/ml, and 400 μl of the cell suspension was put into an electroporation cuvette together with plasmids (see “Results” for the amounts). The cells were electroporated using a BTX ElectroSquare Porator™ ECM 830 at 160 V for 30 ms and one pulse, after which they were diluted in complete medium and plated in 24-well plates. To obtain stable clones, 8 μg of the RE1/NRSEbdnf-LUC reporter construct and 2 μg of pLXSP for puromycin resistance were delivered to one million neural cells. After electroporation, the cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes and a selection medium containing 3 μl/ml puromycin was applied 24 h later. After 15 days of selection pressure, 25 single clones were transferred to 24-well plates and expanded. The subclones were tested for basal luciferase activity and, in a second step, those that were positive were electroporated with DN:REST (5 μg) to detect subclones expressing a functional and responsive RE1/NRSEbdnf. For DN:REST infection, 109 plaque-forming units/ml of virus particles were used to infect 145,000 cells. Chemicals and Chemical Exposure—A panel of compounds of interest to test in the developed assay was assembled. Small molecules known to be pan-HDAC inhibitors (TSA or SAHA) and other transcriptional activators were included, in addition to entities that might modulate BDNF pathway and expression. CRF, CRF antagonist, forskolin, azacitidine-A, TSA, SAHA, and tranylcipromine were purchased from Sigma. Compounds 2, 18, and 19 and amonafide and its derivatives were purchased from Chembridge Corp. (San Diego, CA). The compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and kept in 10 mm stock solutions before being added at the indicated doses to the cells plated in on the day before. The mRNA or proteins were collected for the different experiments at the indicated time points. Determination of Luciferase Expression—In transient experiments, Renilla was used to normalize the transfection efficiency data, and a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were determined using the Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Promega), counting each sample for 8 s. The results are given as firefly/Renilla relative light units (RLUs). Alternatively, after the addition of luciferin as a substrate (Beetle Luciferin, Promega), firefly luciferase activity was determined using the luminometer and is given as RLUs in relation to protein content, as assessed using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Gene Expression Analyses—Three independent room temperature reactions were set up for each RNA stock of 1 μg of total RNA preparations, and gene expression was assessed by means of real-time PCR. The analyses were made in triplicate for each of the genes to obtain replicates for statistical analysis. We used an iCycler Thermal Cycler with a multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). All of the reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl, containing 25 ng of cDNA, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 25 units/ml iTaq DNA polymerase, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 nm SYBR Green I fluorescein, stabilizers (iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix-Bio-Rad), and 0.2 μm of forward and reverse primers. The amplification cycles for total BDNF consisted of an initial 10-min denaturing cycle at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 56 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence was quantified during the 56 °C annealing step, and product formation was confirmed by means of a melting curve analysis (55–94 °C). The amounts of target gene mRNA were normalized to a reference gene (β-actin) amplified following the same protocol. The primer sequences were: BDNF-F, 5′-GAT GAG GAC CAG AAG GTT CG-3′; BDNF-R, 5′-GAT TGG GTA GTT CGG CAT TG-3′; β-actin-F, 5′-AGT GTG ACG TTG ACA TCC GTA-3′; and β-actin-R, 5′-GCC AGA GCA GTA ATC TCC TTC T-3′ (F, forward; R, reverse). The amplification cycles for synapsin I and M4 muscarinic receptor consisted of an initial 3-min denaturing cycle at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence was quantified during the 60 °C annealing step, and product formation was confirmed by means of a melting curve analysis (55–94 °C). The primer sequences were: synapsin I-F, 5′-TTT TTG GGG GAC TTG ACA TC-3′; synapsin I-R, 5′-AGT TCC ACG ATG AGC TGC TT-3′; M4 muscarinic-F, 5′-GGA ACC TCT GGC TTG TTC C-3′; M4 muscarinic-R, 5′-CAG ACT GAT TGG CTG AGC TG-3′. The amplification cycles for E2F1 consisted of an initial 10-min denaturing cycle at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. Fluorescence was quantified during the 60 °C annealing step, and product formation was confirmed by means of a melting curve analysis (55–94 °C). The primer sequences were: E2F1-F, 5′-CCC GCC GGT GAA ACG-3′; E2F1-R, 5′-GCC TCT GCC CCG GAA T-3′. The amplification cycles for REST/NRSF consisted of an initial 3-min denaturing cycle at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence was quantified during the 60 °C annealing step, and product formation confirmed by a melting curve analysis (55–94 °C). The primer sequences were: REST/NRSF-F, 5′-CGA ACT CAC ACA GGA GAA CG-3′; REST/NRSF-R, 5′-GAG GCC ACA TAA TTG CAC TG-3′. All the amounts of target gene mRNA were normalized to a reference gene (β-actin) according to a previous study (44Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24586) Google Scholar). ELISA Assay—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer consisting of glycerol 10%, 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, Triton X-100 1%, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA supplemented with 1:100 of Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Sigma). The samples were homogenized, sonicated, and centrifuged (Biofuge, 15 min at 4 °C at maximum speed), and the supernatants were collected and stored at −80 °C. The samples were assayed for BDNF using an ImmunoAssay System (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. The proteins were quantified by means of a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) before loading. Cell Viability Assay—80,000 cells per well were plated in triplicate into 24-well plates. After 24-h incubation at 33 °C in 5% CO2, the cultures were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the medium was replaced by serum-deprived medium and then incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points, the cells were exposed to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-phenyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich), and the mitochondrial release of formazan was quantified at 560 nm after incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Immunocytochemistry—4500 STHdhQ111/HdhQ111 cells were plated in 96-well Cellomics plates, coated with poly-lysine, and, after adhesion, exposed to the selected compound. At the indicated time points, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% for 15 min, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1× phosphate-buffered saline. They were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat milk, and 5% goat serum. The cells were exposed to primary antibody (1:500) rabbit polyclonal anti-REST (Upstate) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the goat anti-rabbit FluoroLink Cy2 (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibody (1:500) for 2 h. The nuclei were stained blue with DAPI. Automatic image capture and analysis were performed using a Cellomics Array Scan IV (Thermo Fisher) with the Cytoplasm to Nucleus Translocation BioApplication. For the BrdUrd incorporation study, STHdhQ111/HdhQ111 cells were exposed to stress stimuli in the presence or absence of compound 18. BrdUrd incorporation was performed over the last 24 h, and the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. After DNA denaturation, the cells were stained using anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). For DNA staining, fixed cells were incubated with DAPI. A total of 200 cells was counted for each sample. Statistical Analysis—Bonferroni's test or an ANOVA t test were used as indicated to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. Development of the RE1/NRSEbdnf Luciferase Reporter Assay—We initially evaluated the functioning of the RE1/NRSEbdnf luciferase construct and its responsiveness to REST/NRSF. ST14A neural cells, which are known to express endogenous REST/NRSF (13Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L. Cataudella T. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar), were transiently transfected with the reporter construct and a dominant negative REST/NRSF construct (DN:REST) (22Wood I.C. Belyaev N.D. Bruce A.W. Jones C. Mistry M. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The latter consists of the DNA binding domain of REST/NRSF, but lacks the repressor domain, and was expected to attenuate REST/NRSF binding to RE1/NRSEbdnf within the luciferase reporter and increase luciferase activity. Forty-eight hours after transfection, there was a proportional increase in luciferase activity with increasing doses of DN:REST in comparison with untransfected cells or cells treated with an empty vector (Fig. 1A), thus indicating that DN:REST overexpression attenuates endogenous REST/NRSF binding to RE1/NRSEbdnf in a dose-dependent manner. When co-transfected with RE1/NRSEbdnf luciferase, REST/NRSF counteracted the luciferase expression induced by DN:REST (Fig. 1A, light gray column). Consistently, when present in the promoter controlling the reporter (mRE1/NRSEbdnf-LUC), a specific mutation in the RE1/NRSE sequence abolished the effect of DN:REST (Fig. 1B). It is also worth noting that mRE1/NRSEbdnf -LUC transfection gave rise to a stronger luciferase signal than RE1/NRSEbdnf because of the lack of the silencing activity of mutant RE1/NRSEbdnf (Fig. 1B, third versus first column). We therefore concluded that the RE1/NRSEbdnf luciferase reporter is functional and specifically responsive to REST/NRSF transcription factor. Generation and Genetic Validation of the Stable DiaNRSELuc8 Reporter Cell Line—To obtain stable cell subclones, the ST14A neural cell line was co-transfected with RE1/NRSEbdnf luciferase and pLXSP vector. After antibiotic selection, 25 puromycin-resistant subclones were isolated, and the basal expression of the transgene was evaluated by means of a luciferase assay; 13 subclones were discarded because of the decrease in luciferase activity over multiple passages. The remaining subclones were transiently transfected with DN:REST or an empty vector, and their luciferase activity was tested to select subclones stably expressing a functional and responsive RE1/NRSEbdnf luciferase reporter. 8 of the 12 clones showed no more than a 1.5-fold increase in luciferase expression, which we thought might be due to effects of the surrounding chromatin at the transgene integration sites. However, DN:REST significantly increased luciferase activity in the remaining four clones, and we selected the one with the best signal-to-background ratio for further characterization. Fig. 1C shows that this clone (designated DiaNRSELuc8) specifically responds to DN:REST infection with a 6-fold increase in luciferase activity. Pharmacological Evaluation of DiaNRSELuc8 Cell-based Assay—As REST/NRSF recruits HDACs and acts as a repressor through chromatin remodeling (23Roopra A. Sharling L. Wood I.C. Briggs T. Bachfischer U. Paquette A.J. Buckley N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2147-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Lunyak V.V. Burgess R. Prefontaine G.G. Nelson C. Sze S.H. Chenoweth J. Schwartz P. Pevzner P.A. Glass C. Mandel G. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2002; 298: 1747-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), the assay response was tested in the presence of the known transcriptional activators: pan-HDAC inhibitors TSA and SAHA. In particular, when DiaNRSELuc8 cells were exposed to TSA at concentrations of up to 300 nm, there was a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 1D). The effect of TSA indicates that HDAC activity is required for the repression of RE1/NRSEbdnf by REST/NRSF, and that the RE1/NRSEbdnf within the luciferase reporter is responsive to an HDAC inhibitor. For this reason, we selected TSA as the reference compound for further assay development. After scaling down the assay to 96 wells, we calculated the Z′ factor, a dimensionless measure of the quality of a high-throughput screening assay that considers the mean signal and standard deviation from positive and negative controls (25Zhang J.H. Chung T.D. Oldenburg K.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 1999; 4: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). The calculated Z′ factor value from 20 independent experiments in which DiaNRSELuc8 cells were exposed to 75 nm of TSA for 72 h was 0.81 ± 0.12, thus indicating the reliability of the assay. The basis for the transcriptional response of the developed assay was evaluated in a pilot drug screening study of a panel of selected compounds. In the search for a de-repressor of transcription, we first used compounds that are known to possess this activity. We included a DNA-demethylating agent, azacitidine-A, which activates gene transcription by reducing the stability of silencing signals, and amonafide and its structurally similar derivatives of the C91 series, which have previously been identified as increasing transcriptional activity in a reporter assay of mutant huntingtin knock-in cells in which the reporter was regulated by six Specificity protein-1 binding sites (26Kazantsev A.G. Hersch S.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2007; PubMed Google Scholar). Small molecules targeting the cell pathways involved in regulating BDNF expression were also chosen, in particular forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, because an increase in cAMP levels enhances BDNF expression (27Condorelli D.F. Dell'Albani P. Mudo G. Timmusk T. Belluardo N. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As it is known that antidepressants also increase BDNF expression levels (28Nibuya M. Morinobu S. Duman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7539-7547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Altar C.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 59-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), we selected tranylcipromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor; and as some published findings indicate that CRF stimulates BDNF expression (30Schaaf M.J.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two COG subunits were originally discovered as Sec34p (now called Cog3p) and Sec35p (Cog2p); yeast carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in either of the corresponding genes exhibited a block in trafficking and accumulation of small vesicles at non-permissive temperatures (1Wuestehube L.J. Duden R. Eun A. Hamamoto S. Korn P. Ram R. Schekman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 393-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells several lines of evidence likewise argue for a trafficking role for COG (for review, see Refs. 2Lupashin V. Sztul E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 3Oka T. Krieger M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2005; 137: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Ungar D. Oka T. Krieger M.

Perhaps most directly, mammalian COG was initially purified based on its ability to stimulate an in vitro intra-Golgi transport assay (5Ungar D. Oka T. Brittle E.E. Vasile E. Lupashin V.V.

In vivo, depletion of COG causes defects in glycosylation that appear to arise from defects in retrograde trafficking within the Golgi (7Bruinsma P. Spelbrink R.G. Nothwehr S.F. J. Biol.

Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Consistent with a retrograde role for COG, genetic and physical interactions between COG and components of the coat protein I (COPI) vesicle coat have been reported in several systems (10Oka T. Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Krieger M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2423-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Kim D.W. Massey T. Sacher M. Pypaert M. Ferro-Novick S.

Duden R. Lupashin V.V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The COG complex belongs to a group of multisubunit protein assemblies commonly termed “tethering complexes” (14Pfeffer S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 15Sztul E. Lupashin V. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290 (-C26): C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Waters M.G.

Tethering complexes are thought to act upstream of SNAREs, mediating the initial attachment of intracellular trafficking vesicles to their membrane targets. Many, if not all, tethering complexes are also Rab effectors. One model for the molecular function of tethering complexes is that they act as protein interaction hubs, orchestrating the sequential actions of Rabs and SNAREs (and potentially other proteins) during the process of vesicle docking and fusion (4Ungar D. Oka T. Krieger M. Hughson F.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 113-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A hurdle in critically evaluating such models is a dearth of structural information. Recently, structures of several subunits of the exocyst complex have been determined (18Dong G. Hutagalung A.H.

Biol. 2005; 12: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These results are of particular relevance to COG because detectable sequence homology has been reported between regions of some exocyst and COG subunits (17Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), although the possibility that this homology represents convergent evolution has been raised recently (25Koumandou V.L. Dacks J.B. Coulson R.M. Field M.C. BMC Evol. Biol. 2007; 7: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To begin to investigate the structure of COG, we have initially focused on the Cog2p (Sec35p) subunit. The choice of Cog2p was based on several considerations. First, cog2 mutants display severe phenotypes in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary cells (1Wuestehube L.J. Duden R. Eun A. Hamamoto S. Korn P. Ram R. Schekman R. Genetics. 1996; 142: 393-406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Segal M. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1576-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Second, a pool of soluble Cog2p exists in yeast cytosol, suggesting that free Cog2p is likely well folded (Ref. 27VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; but see also Ref. 24Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Third, Cog2p is relatively modest in size; at 30 kDa, it is the smallest of the yeast subunits (although its mammalian ortholog is much larger at 83 kDa). Fourth, initial attempts to overproduce Cog2p for the production of antibodies (27VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) revealed that recombinant Cog2p was largely soluble in Escherichia coli, boding well for structural studies. Here we report the structure of a fragment constituting a major portion of yeast Cog2p (residues 61–262), determined using multidimensional NMR. Residues 61–108, which are important for solubility in vitro and function in vivo, populate helical conformations in this Cog2p fragment but do not appear to adopt a fixed tertiary structure. The remainder of the fragment (residues 109–262) forms a six-helix bundle. The fold bears a general resemblance to exocyst subunit domains, strengthening the hypothesis that helical bundle domains are a common structural unit from which both COG and exocyst complexes are constructed (22Sivaram M.V. Furgason M.L. Brewer D.N. Munson M. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Munson M. Novick P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Protein Overexpression and Purification—Recombinant Cog2 constructs were generated by PCR and expressed in E. coli BL21 as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins using the expression plasmid pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare). Cultures were grown in Luria Bertani media at 37 °C to an A600 of ∼0.6–0.8 before adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were grown an additional 12–16 h at 23 °C and then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer 300 (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resuspended cells were lysed using a EmulsiFlex homogenizer (Avestin); the resulting lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 24,000 × g and applied to glutathione-agarose resin (Sigma). After washing the immobilized fusion proteins sequentially with buffer 300, buffer 500 (containing 500 mm NaCl), and buffer 150 (containing 150 mm NaCl), the Cog2p moiety was released by thrombin cleavage. Thrombin was removed from the eluate using benzamidine-agarose affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare). Final purification was accomplished using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75 or Superose 12; GE Healthcare) in buffer 300. For isotopic labeling, cells were instead grown in M9 minimal media with 15NH4Cl and/or uniformly 13C-labeled glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as the sole source of nitrogen and/or carbon (29Muchmore D.C. McIntosh L.P. Russell C.B. Anderson D.E. Dahlquist F.W. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 177: 44-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Cultures in M9 media were grown as above but were harvested 4 h after induction. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were carried out using 7–15 μm protein in 1 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 250 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein concentration was determined using a ninhydrin assay (30Rosen H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1957; 67: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Spectra were collected in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette using Aviv 62DS or Jasco 810 CD spectropolarimeters. All wavelength scans were collected at 4 °C with 1-s averaging times and represent the average of three scans. Generation of Yeast Expression Constructs—Plasmids were based on pSV15 (27VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), which contains the entire COG2 gene along with ∼500 bp of genomic flanking sequence at both the 5′ and 3′ ends, in a pRS415 background (31Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 32Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each deletion was created by PCR, using 5′ primers designed to loop out a region corresponding to residues 2–60 or 2–96. The 5′ primers included a HindIII site upstream of the start codon, whereas the 3′ primer included a BamHI site in the 3′-flanking region. Yeast cells were co-transformed with an excess of the resulting PCR product together with pSV15 that had been digested with BsgI and AvrII to remove sequences corresponding to Cog2p residues 57–262 and a portion of the 3′-flanking region. Transformants capable of growing on SC -Leu were screened by PCR for the desired deletions, the presence of which was subsequently confirmed by DNA sequencing. Haploid Growth Curves—Colonies from single germinated spores were grown in 5 ml of rich media (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) overnight at 30 °C. From these cultures, 2.5 A600 units were transferred to 25 ml of fresh media in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, for an initial A600 of ∼0.1, and the optical density was monitored during a further 12 h of growth at 30 °C. NMR Sample Preparation—Purified Cog2p fragments were exchanged into 3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% D2O, and 0.02% sodium azide using a NAP5 column (GE Healthcare). The exchanged proteins were concentrated to ∼1 mm using pre-rinsed UltraFree 4 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Data Collection and Processing—All data were acquired for Cog2-(61–262) using Varian Inova spectrometers. Preliminary NMR experiments were performed at Princeton University using a 600-MHz instrument. All of the spectra used for structure determination were acquired at the Environmental and Molecular Sciences Laboratory at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 13C,1H HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, HNCO, and HSQC spectra were collected on a 600-MHz instrument; CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB, HNCO, and HSQC spectra were collected on a 750-MHz instrument, and 13C-edited and 15N-edited NOESY spectra were collected on an 800 MHz instrument.

Preliminary spectra were acquired at 25 °C, and spectra used for structure determination were acquired at 35 °C. Spectra were processed using NMRPipe (33Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11562) Google Scholar) and analyzed using NMRView (34Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1994; 29: 1012-1014Crossref Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Data Analysis and Structure Calculation—Backbone and most side-chain resonances were assigned using gradient-enhanced HNCO, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, HCCH-TOCSY, and 13C,1H HSQC-NOESY spectra and standard assignment procedures (35Bax A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16106-16115Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Aromatic side chain resonance assignments required homonuclear two-dimensional TOCSY, NOESY, and double quantum-filtered COSY experiments and a 13C,1H NOESY-HSQC experiment acquired with the carbon carrier in the center of the aromatic region. A 13C,1H HSQC experiment performed on 10% 13C-labeled Cog2-(61–262) was obtained to determine stereospecific assignments of valine and leucine methyl groups. ϕ and Ψ torsion angle restraints were predicted by the program TALOS (38Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) based on backbone chemical shifts. Dihedral angle predictions were restrained to 1.5 times the S.D. observed in the TALOS data base, with a minimum of 22.5°. H-bond restraints were assumed for regions of the protein exhibiting strongly helical chemical shift indices, specifically 108–128, 132–150, 159–176, 185–207, 215–242, 249–258. Structures calculated without these restraints were of similar energy and fold. Structures were calculated using CNS (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4427) Google Scholar). A total of 1200 structures was calculated, and the 20 structures with the lowest NOE energy were selected. Structure figures were generated using PyMOL (41DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. 2002; (, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA)Google Scholar). Alignment and Structure Comparison—BLAST searching revealed three Cog2p homologs with E < 10-17, all of them from other fungi. The next best score was E = 0.06; iterative searching using Psi-BLAST was needed to detect more distant homologs including human Cog2p (23% sequence identity over 111 residues). ClustalW (42Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55749) Google Scholar) was used to align S. cerevisiae Cog2p with the three other fungal homologs, Candida glabrata (40% identity over 253 residues), Ashbya gossypii (29% identity over 254 residues), and Kluyveromyces lactis (31% identity over 243 residues). The alignment figure was produced using Alscript (43Barton G.J. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Buried residues were defined as those residues with <15% of their side chains exposed to solvent, as calculated using WHAT IF (44Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1990; 8: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The previously determined exocyst subunit structures were divided into domains according to the description of each structure in the corresponding original report (18Dong G. Hutagalung A.H. Fu C.

Park J. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 566-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae Cog2 subunit, originally named Sec35p, contains 262 residues. 4The original genome annotation misplaced the start codon 39 bases upstream, with the consequence that earlier literature refers to a 275-residue protein with shifted residue numbering. CD spectroscopy revealed that recombinant Cog2p is highly (∼85%) α-helical (Fig. 1A). Our efforts to produce diffraction quality crystals of the full-length protein were, however, unsuccessful. To identify large fragments that might constitute more favorable targets for structural analysis, we subjected recombinant Cog2p to limited proteolysis using a battery of nonspecific proteases. Two cleavage products appeared, based on their electrophoretic mobility, to be produced consistently by several of the proteases. These species, identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry, differed only at their N termini: Cog2-(56–262) and Cog2-(97–262). Next, we overproduced each of these Cog2p fragments as a recombinant protein in E. coli. Both fragments, like the full-length protein, were highly α-helical (Fig. 1A). While scaling up production of Cog2-(56–262), we observed that it precipitated at concentrations greater than ∼1 mg/ml. A more soluble variant was produced by eliminating five predominantly hydrophobic residues (His-Tyr-Leu-Pro-Leu) to generate Cog2-(61–262), and this variant was overexpressed and purified to >95% homogeneity. Its CD spectrum was indistinguishable from that of Cog2-(56–262) (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Cog2-(61–262) remained soluble and monomeric at concentrations in excess of ∼20 mg/ml (1 mm), as judged by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering (data not shown). Because of its excellent solution properties, Cog2-(61–262) became the subject of most of the subsequent studies described here. This fragment contains 77% of the full-length Cog2p subunit, including almost all of the “conserved amphipathic helical region” (residues 60–125) identified by Whyte and Munro (17Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) near the N terminus of several COG, exocyst, and Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) subunits. To determine whether the N-terminal-truncated versions of Cog2p identified by limited proteolysis were functional in vivo, we analyzed whether they could substitute for the full-length protein in S. cerevisiae. Deletion of the COG2 gene leads to a very severe growth defect at 30 °C and complete inviability at 21 °C (27VanRheenen S.M. Cao X. Lupashin V.V. Barlowe C. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1107-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CEN-based yeast plasmids were constructed to express a truncated COG2 gene under the control of its own promoter. These plasmids were transformed into a diploid yeast strain with only one copy of the COG2 gene (Research Genetics); the other copy of COG2 was deleted and replaced by the G418 marker. After sporulation and tetrad dissection, haploid spores were tested for the ability to grow into colonies. Because spores lacking COG2 grow extremely slowly, tetrads from the strain transformed with the parent plasmid (empty vector) never yielded more than two colonies. The same result was observed for a strain transformed with an expression plasmid encoding Cog2-(97–262). Thus, Cog2-(97–262) was unable to functionally replace full-length Cog2p, perhaps because it lacks more than half of the conserved amphipathic helical region. For the strain expressing Cog2-(61–262), however, 16 of 36 dissected tetrads yielded four viable spores. The presence of both the expression plasmid and the chromosomal deletion within the same spores was confirmed by growth on selective media. Dissected tetrads yielding fewer than four viable spores are readily explained by the random segregation of both the plasmid expressing Cog2-(61–262) and the intact chromosomal copy of COG2 into the same spore. These results establish that Cog2-(61–262), but not Cog2-(97–262), can functionally substitute for full-length Cog2p. The colonies formed by the strain expressing only Cog2-(61–262) were smaller than the colonies formed by strains expressing full-length Cog2p. A significant growth defect was also observed in liquid culture, with the cells expressing only Cog2-(61–262) displaying a 2.7-fold longer doubling time compared with a control strain (Fig. 1B). Nonetheless, it was clear that Cog2-(61–262) provides sufficient Cog2p function to partially rescue the growth of haploid cells lacking full-length Cog2p. Based on the excellent solution properties of this fragment together with the observation that a fragment of similar apparent molecular weight was produced as a limited digest product by all four proteases tested (chymotrypsin, proteinase K, subtilisin, and trypsin), we conclude that Cog2-(61–262) retains much of the core structure as well as the core function of the full-length protein. Although Cog2-(61–262) formed large crystals, they did not diffract beyond 8 Å resolution, precluding x-ray structure determination. At 23.4 kDa, however, Cog2-(61–262) presented a potential target for structure determination by multidimensional NMR. The dispersion and relatively uniform intensity of cross peaks in 1H,15N HSQC spectra confirmed that Cog2-(61–262) is folded and stable (Fig. 2). The size and high α-helicity of the protein gave rise to severe spectral overlap. Nonetheless, by using three-dimensional spectra to resolve ambiguities, it proved possible to make backbone resonance assignments for 182 non-proline residues (91% completeness). Comparison of the Cα chemical shifts observed for Cog2-(61–262) with those of a random coil revealed six unambiguously α-helical regions: amino acids 107–127, 133–153, 158–177, 184–209, 217–243, and 249–257 (Fig. 3). The extent of α-helical structure is in agreement with the CD spectra (Fig. 1A). The chemical shift data, moreover, appear generally consistent with the proposal by Whyte and Munro (24Whyte J.R. Munro S. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) that the conserved amphipathic helical region has two helices (Cog2p residues 60–82 and 92–125) separated by an extended loop. We were unable to identify long-range NOEs between residues within the region 61–108 or between this region and the remainder of the protein. Lacking sufficient NOEs, it was not possible to define the tertiary structure of this N-terminal region. Interestingly, residues 61–108 are required for good solution behavior; shorter recombinant fragments beginning at residues 97, 110, or 116 displayed poor solubility, poor folding, or both (data not shown). Nonetheless, it appears that residues 61–108, including 73% of the conserved amphipathic helical region, fails to adopt a fixed tertiary structure in Cog2-(61–262). Structure calculations were, therefore, restricted to residues 109–262. A total of 2915 structurally informative NOE restraints, 555 of which were long-range, were used to calculate 1200 structures. The 20 structures with the lowest NOE energy are presented in Fig. 4. General structural statistics are presented in Table 1.TABLE 1Structure calculation statistics for Cog2p-(109-262) Presented is an ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures, all of which have NOE energies below 6.8 kcal/mol.

The prodomains of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to the food vacuole. Using serial truncations, deletions, and point mutations, we showed that both a 20-amino acid stretch of the lumenal portion and a 10-amino acid stretch of the cytoplasmic portion of the falcipain-2 prodomain were required for efficient food vacuolar trafficking. Mutants with altered trafficking were arrested at the plasma membrane, implicating trafficking via this structure.

Malaria causes hundreds of millions of illnesses annually, and Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent human malaria pathogen, causes a million or more deaths each year (1Greenwood B.M. Bojang K.

Intraerythrocytic P. falciparum parasites develop over 48 h from rings to more metabolically active trophozoites and then to multinucleated schizonts, which rupture host erythrocytes, releasing invasive merozoites that reinitiate erythrocytic infection. Trophozoites take up and hydrolyze hemoglobin to obtain amino acids for protein synthesis (2Rosenthal P.J. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Liu J.

Hemoglobin is acquired from the erythrocyte via large endocytic vesicles called cytostomes and is degraded in the food vacuole, a lysosome-like acidic organelle (4Rosenthal P.J. Sherman I.W.

Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 8840-8845Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin hydrolysis requires the action of multiple proteases, including falcipain cysteine proteases, plasmepsin aspartic proteases, and others (5Rosenthal P.J. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Shenai B.R.

Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Disruption of the falcipain-2 gene led to accumulation of undegraded hemoglobin in the food vacuole, confirming that this enzyme participates in hemoglobin hydrolysis (13Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4384-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Disruption of falcipain-3 could not be achieved, but the gene was readily replaced with a tagged functional copy, indicating that falcipain-3 is essential for erythrocytic parasites (14Sijwali P.S. Koo J. Singh N. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The roles of falcipain-2′ (a near-identical copy of falcipain-2) and falcipain-1 are unknown; knock out of these two proteases led to no apparent alterations in erythrocytic parasites (14Sijwali P.S. Koo J. Singh N. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 15Sijwali P.S. Kato K. Seydel K.B. Gut J. Lehman J. Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Miller L.H. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8721-8726Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanism of trafficking to the P. falciparum food vacuole is poorly understood. In higher eukaryotes, lysosomal targeting generally requires glycosylation and trafficking is mediated by mannose-6-phosphate receptors (16Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, P. falciparum does not have a robust glycosylation machinery (17Gowda D.C. Davidson E.A. Parasitol. Today. 1999; 15: 147-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and there is no evidence for trafficking mediated by this process. Zymogenic enzymes in some eukaryotes, including yeast (18Klionsky D.J. Banta L.M. Emr S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2105-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and plants (19Matsuoka K. Neuhaus J. J. Exp. Botany. 1999; 50: 165-174Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), carry vacuolar localization signals in their prodomains. In yeast, proforms of soluble vacuolar enzymes are targeted via a receptor-mediated transport mechanism (20Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, zymogenic forms of food vacuolar falcipains and plasmepsins are membrane-bound (6Klemba M. Goldberg D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 275-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); it is unclear whether classical receptor-mediated transport is possible for membrane-bound proteins. Membrane-bound vacuolar proteins are trafficked by adaptor-mediated mechanisms in yeast and other eukaryotes (21Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). However, the classical dileucine or hydrophobic cytoplasmic motifs required for adaptor binding by many vacuolar/lysosomal proteins (21Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 22Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5349-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are not seen in falcipains or plasmepsins. These observations suggest that previously described mechanisms may not mediate food vacuole trafficking of P. falciparum proteases. Indeed, immunoelectron microscopy studies suggested that plasmepsin II initially traffics to the plasma membrane, followed by transport with erythrocyte contents in cytostomes to the food vacuole (23Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, targeting signals for plasmepsins or other food vacuole proteins have not been characterized in detail. As a first step toward characterizing food vacuolar trafficking pathways, we sought to identify motifs that target falcipains to this organelle. We therefore created multiple chimeras linking portions of the falcipain prodomains with green fluorescent protein (GFP). 3The abbreviations used are: FPfalcipainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineHSPheat shock protein 3The abbreviations used are: FPfalcipainGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPBSphosphate-buffered salineHSPheat shock protein Our data reveal a novel mechanism of trafficking for the P. falciparum cysteine proteases, with portions of both the cytoplasmic and lumenal domains of these membrane-bound proenzymes necessary for food vacuolar trafficking and alterations in targeting signals leading to trapping at the plasma membrane. falcipain green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline heat shock protein falcipain green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline heat shock protein Plasmid Construction—Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used for all PCR reactions.

Parasitol. 2003; 130: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which contains a Cam5/hDHFR/Hrp2 selection cassette and Hsp86/Hsp60-GFP/PbDT3 cassette for expression of GFP fusion proteins. pSSPF2 bearing Hsp60-GFP was digested with BglII, its ends were filled in with Klenow, and it then was digested with AvrII to release the Hsp60 fragment. The full-length prodomain of falcipain-2 was amplified using forward primers with BstB1/PstI/SalI and reverse primers with KpnI/AvrII sites. AvrII-digested PCR product was ligated to the digested plasmid to generate the proFP2-GFP construct under the HSP86 promoter. A linker sequence (from the KpnI/AvrII sites) encoding for amino acids Gly-Thr-Pro-Arg is present between the end of the prodomain coding sequence and the start of the GFP sequence in all the proFP2 constructs. For generating falcipain-3 constructs, the prodomain of falcipain-3 was amplified using forward primers with SalI and reverse primers with KpnI sites. SalI/KpnI-digested PCR product was placed in the proFP2-GFP plasmid to replace proFP2. All proFP3 constructs described in this report are under the HSP86 promoter. proFP2-GFP, proFP2-CT-GFP, and proFP2-lum-GFP constructs were generated under both the HSP86 and the endogenous FP2 promoter; all other proFP2 truncation/deletion/point mutation constructs were generated under the endogenous promoter. To replace the HSP86 promoter with the native falcipain-2 promoter, a 1.2-kb DNA sequence upstream from the start codon of falcipain-2 was amplified. The plasmid and product were digested with SacII and SalI and cloned into the vector to replace the HSP86 promoter. For all truncation constructs the forward primer contained SalI and the reverse primer was truncation-specific, carrying a KpnI site. The PCR product and plasmid were digested with SalI and KpnI and ligated together. For specific deletions or point mutations, two sets of PCR reactions were performed to amplify the regions upstream and downstream of the deletion independently, with slight overlap at the ends. Primers were designed such that the 3′-end of the reverse primer of the upstream PCR was complementary to the 5′-end of the forward primer of the downstream PCR. The PCR products were gelpurified and mixed in equal volume. These products recombined in vitro and were used as a template for a secondary PCR reaction. The PCR product and plasmid were digested with SalI and KpnI and then ligated as mentioned above. Expected sequences of all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Parasite Culture and Plasmid Transfection—All the experiments were performed in P. falciparum strain 3D7 (MRA151 from the Malaria Research and Reference Reagent Resource Center). Parasites were cultured in human erythrocytes at 2% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (UCSF Cell Culture Facility) supplemented with 10% human serum. Synchronization was maintained by serial treatment with 5% d-sorbitol. Early ringstage parasites (100-μl packed cell volume, 4–6% parasitemia) were transfected with 80–100 μg of plasmids (prepared with a Qiagen maxiprep kit) in a 0.2-cm cuvette by using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 0.31 kV, 950 μF, and maximum resistance (13Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4384-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Transfectants were selected with WR99210 (2.5 nm; Jacobus Pharmaceuticals), which was added 48 h after the electroporation and maintained thereafter. One week after emergence of parasites (3–4 weeks after transfection), WR99210 was increased to 5.0 nm, and transfectants were maintained at this concentration of the drug henceforth. Microscopy—Microscopy was performed on live trophozoites at 22–28 h after erythrocyte invasion unless indicated otherwise. Parasites were washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and once in PBS and then allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma) for 30 min in the presence of Hoechst 33342 (10 μm; Molecular Probes) to visualize the nucleus. Unattached cells were gently washed off using PBS. A coverslip was placed on the barely wet slide, and the cells were imaged immediately using a Zeiss Axioplan epifluorescence microscope using a 63× objective lens. A Hamamatsu CCD camera was used to capture images, and the images were processed using Openlab software (Improvision) for artificial coloring, contrast adjustment, and overlapping images. For Fig. 1, confocal microscopy was performed as mentioned above using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope under a 100× objective. For immunofluorescence microscopy, trophozoites washed with 1× PBS (as mentioned above) were allowed to adhere to poly-l-lysine-coated slides (Sigma) for 30 min. Excess unattached cells were washed off with 1× PBS. The cells were fixed for 30 min with 3% formaldehyde + 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at room temperature, followed by 15 min of permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After three washes with PBS, the cells were incubated with 10 mm NH4Cl for 10 min, followed by blocking for 3 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. 1/150 dilution rat anti-FP2 or FP3 (12Dahl E.L.

After several washes, 1/300 dilution Cy3-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratory) or 1/300 Alexa-594-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) was added to the slide for 45 min along with 10 μm Hoechst 33342. Cells were washed thoroughly and mounted using ProLong gold anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes) and visualized under a ×100 objective in a Nikon Optiphot epifluorescence microscope. Immunoelectron microscopy was performed as described elsewhere (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected trophozoites were purified using a 63% Percoll gradient after washing twice with serum-free RPMI medium. Concentrated parasites were fixed for 2 h at room temperature with 3% formaldehyde (Electron Microscopy grade) and 0.01% glutaraldehyde. Fixed parasites were washed twice with PBS, and electron microscopy was performed at the UCSF Cell Imaging core facility using standard protocols (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Molecular Probes) was used at a 1/1000 dilution and rat anti-falcipain-2 (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) at a 1/500 dilution for immunodetection. The Prodomains of Falcipain-2 and Falcipain-3 Are Sufficient to Direct Trafficking to the Food Vacuole—To test whether the prodomains of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are sufficient for food vacuolar targeting, we generated constructs encoding GFP fused to the C-terminal ends of the falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 prodomains (proFP2-GFP, proFP3-GFP), with expression driven by the HSP86 promoter, and plasmids bearing these constructs were transfected into P. falciparum (Fig. 1a). Expression of GFP fusions of expected sizes was confirmed by Western blots (supplemental Fig. S1). GFP fusion proteins were targeted to the food vacuoles of young trophozoites, as evidenced by co-localization with hemozoin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin in this compartment, when visualized using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1, b and c). Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed co-localization of proFP2-GFP (15-nm gold particles) and native falcipain-2 (10-nm gold particles) in the food vacuole (Fig. 1d). Co-localization of proFP2-GFP and proFP3-GFP was also observed with antibodies directed against the endogenous food vacuolar proteins falcipain-2, falcipain-3 (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the P. falciparum Chloroquine Resistance Transporter (PfCRT) (26Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Talley A.K. Cooper R.A. Dzekunov S.M. Ferdig M.T. Ursos L.M. Sidhu A.B. Naude B. Deitsch K.W. Su X.Z. Wootton J.C. Roepe P.D. Wellems T.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 861-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). With some young trophozoites, we also observed proFP2-GFP in discrete structures both on the parasite membrane and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, e and f). With proFP3-GFP, in addition to food vacuolar localization we observed GFP-labeled punctate structures consistently within the parasite cytoplasm and sometimes at the parasite plasma membrane (Fig. 1c and supplemental Fig. S2). Addition of Brefeldin A, a compound that blocks traffic from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi compartment, led to perinuclear localization of proFP2-GFP, suggesting accumulation in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1g), as expected for a protein normally entering the secretory pathway. It is known that during the 48-h intraerythrocytic life cycle of the malaria parasite, timing of expression is critical for proper protein targeting and function (27Rug M. Wickham M.E. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 6095-6105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To mimic native gene expression, we also generated a proFP2-GFP construct in which expression was driven by the endogenous falcipain-2 promoter. No differences were observed in the localization pattern between cells with expression driven by the HSP86 or falcipain-2 promoters (supplemental Fig. S2), and fluorescence intensity was stronger with the endogenous promoter. Subsequent studies of falcipain-2 localization therefore utilized constructs with the endogenous promoter. The Cytoplasmic Portions of the Falcipain-2 and Falcipain-3 Prodomains Are Not Sufficient for Food Vacuolar Trafficking—Falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are type II membrane proteins with prodomains containing N-terminal cytoplasmic portions and C-terminal lumenal portions that flank a membrane-spanning domain (Fig. 1a). To determine whether individual domains could efficiently target GFP to the food vacuole, we generated additional constructs. Trophozoites expressing only the cytoplasmic and transmembrane portions of the prodomain fused to GFP (proFP2-CT-GFP and proFP3-CT-GFP) displayed predominant plasma membrane GFP fluorescence, seen as bright fluorescent rims on the periphery of intraerythrocytic parasites (Fig. 3a). We also observed some perinuclear GFP in these parasites. Thus, the cytoplasmic portion of falcipain-2 or falcipain-3 is not sufficient for food vacuolar trafficking but targets to the plasma membrane. Trophozoites expressing only the lumenal portion of the prodomain fused to GFP (proFP2-lum-GFP and proFP3-lum-GFP) displayed fluorescence throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b), as expected for proteins lacking a signal sequence directing entry into the secretory pathway. Our results here suggest that trafficking pathways for falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are similar and that trafficking includes vesicular transport via the plasma membrane. Falcipain-2 Trafficking Is Driven by Both Lumenal and Cytoplasmic Targeting Motifs—We next focused our efforts on characterizing trafficking signals in the falcipain-2 prodomain, as the robust transport of proFP2-GFP to the food vacuole allowed us to easily distinguish phenotypes. To this end, we generated serial truncations of the lumenal domain, yielding constructs encoding partial prodomains with between 65 and 225 lumenal amino acids, in each case fused to GFP at the C terminus (Fig. 4). GFP fusion proteins of expected size were produced for each construct (supplemental Fig. S1). Trophozoites expressing proFP2–65-GFP, proFP2–75-GFP, and proFP2–84-GFP displayed a fluorescence pattern identical to that of proFP2-CT-GFP, with distinct plasma membrane localization (supplemental Fig. S3, a–c). Trophozoites transfected with proFP2–95-GFP showed an intermediate phenotype, with a majority of cells (60–80%) showing exclusive plasma membrane fluorescence (Figs. 5a and 6a), and the rest displaying fluorescence in both the plasma membrane and the food vacuole. Most trophozoites (>70%) expressing proFP2–105-GFP showed exclusive food vacuolar fluorescence (Figs. 5b and 6a), and the remainder of cells showed both food vacuole and plasma membrane fluorescence (Fig. 5c). Larger constructs (proFP2–115-GFP, proFP2–120-GFP, proFP2–173-GFP, and proFP2–225-GFP) were efficiently transported to the trophozoite food vacuole (supplemental Fig. S3, d–g). Localization was not uniform among all parasites for each construct, but quantification of GFP localization patterns in trophozoites demonstrated predominant food vacuole localization for proFP2-GFP and all larger constructs (Fig. 6a).FIGURE 5Localization of mutant prodomain constructs.

Most amino acids in this region are identical between falcipain-2, falcipain-2′, falcipain-3, and homologues from several other plasmodial species (Fig. 7b). To further evaluate the roles of these residues in trafficking, we generated constructs with deletion of amino acids 81–110 (proFP2-Δ81–110-GFP) or 95–110 (proFP2-Δ95–110-GFP) fused to GFP (Fig. 4). Trophozoites expressing proFP2-Δ81–110-GFP predominantly displayed patches of fluorescence on the parasite plasma membrane, a phenotype that had not previously been seen (Fig. 5d). Trophozoites transfected with proFP2-Δ95–110-GFP displayed a similar pattern of fluorescence on the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S4b), but more commonly localization of GFP to the parasite food vacuole (supplemental Fig. S4a). Additionally, we mutated conserved lysines in the region of interest to glutamic acid. Trophozoites expressing K95E-GFP resembled those expressing proFP2-Δ95–110-GFP, with some patches of fluorescence on the plasma membrane, but principally localization to the food vacuole (supplemental Fig. S4c). In contrast, trophozoites expressing the triply mutated construct proFP2-K89,90,95E-GFP predominantly had patches of fluorescence on the plasma membrane with or without food vacuolar fluorescence (Fig. 5e), whereas ∼35% of trophozoites showed exclusive food vacuolar GFP localization. Taken together, our results demonstrated a critical role in trafficking for residues 84–105 within the lumenal falcipain-2 prodomain, suggesting that positively charged residues are necessary for proper trafficking, and offered further support for the conclusion that falcipains are transported to the food vacuole via the plasma membrane. We wished also to explore roles of amino acids in the profalcipain-2 cytoplasmic domain in food vacuole trafficking, as motifs on the cytoplasmic side of membrane-bound proteins mediate vacuolar targeting in other organisms (21Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 22Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5349-5352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore generated constructs with deletions in the falcipain-2 cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 4). Trophozoites expressing proFP2-Δ2–15-GFP showed food vacuolar fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S4d). Those transfected with proFP2-Δ5–25-GFP displayed patches of plasma membrane fluorescence in nearly all cells (Fig. 5f), and those transfected with proFP2-Δ16–30-GFP showed patches of plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S4e) and/or food vacuole fluorescence (supplemental Fig. S4f). These results indicate that, in addition to the lumenal domain characterized above, cytoplasmic residues 16–25 are also required for trafficking to the food vacuole. All results described above are for trophozoite-stage parasites. Initial results suggested differential trafficking of some constructs depending on the life cycle stage that was studied. To more systematically address this area, for select constructs we evaluated localization of fusion proteins over the course of the erythrocytic life cycle. Interestingly, for both proFP2–75-GFP and proFP2–95-GFP, young trophozoites showed primarily plasma membrane localization as noted above, but food vacuole localization increased with maturation, and over 75% of late schizonts had only food vacuolar localization of GFP (Fig. 6, b and c). With qualitative assessments of mature schizonts, some localization of GFP to the food vacuole was seen with all constructs in late schizonts, including constructs that localized almost exclusively to the plasma membrane in younger parasites (Fig. 6d). These data suggest a default pathway for targeting proteins to the food vacuole in mature parasites. However, because native falcipain-2 is expressed predominantly in trophozoites (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and because the native promoter led to expression of labeled constructs consistent with that of the native protease, our results showing varied trafficking of constructs in trophozoites are most informative regarding the biologically relevant food vacuole-trafficking pathway. We have investigated the molecular determinants of trafficking of falcipain cysteine proteases to the food vacuole of P. falciparum. We show that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 contain the information required for food vacuolar trafficking in their prodomains, as is the case for many other eukaryotic proteins that are trafficked to vacuoles. However, surprisingly, this trafficking signal is bipartite in nature, with motifs in both the lumenal and cytoplasmic portions of the membrane-bound prodomains. In the lumenal portion, amino acids 84–105 are needed for food vacuolar targeting, with lysine residues within this domain contributing to efficient trafficking. In the cytoplasmic portion, amino acids 16–25 are also necessary for proper trafficking. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of a requirement for signals on both sides of a transmembrane domain for trafficking of a vacuolar protein. Most constructs that did not traffic to the food vacuole were localized to the parasite plasma membrane, with at least two patterns seen, showing diffuse or discontinuous membrane localization. These results suggest that the bipartite falcipain-trafficking signal directs an ordered set of events leading to localization at discrete regions of the plasma membrane followed by trafficking to the food vacuole. Although similar, results for trafficking of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 were not identical. Prior studies have shown that, although these vacuolar hemoglobinases are biochemically very similar, they differ in some important respects. First, falcipain-2 is expressed earlier in the life cycle than falcipain-3 (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Second, knock out of the falcipain-2 gene led to a transient block in hemoglobin hydrolysis, but parasites remained viable (13Sijwali P.S. Rosenthal P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4384-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); parasites could not tolerate knock out of falcipain-3 (14Sijwali P.S. Koo J. Singh N. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 150: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Third, autoprocessing of falcipain-2 occurs over a wide pH range, but falcipain-3 requires acidic pH (9Shenai B.R. Sijwali P.S. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29000-29010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 11Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fourth, the proform and processing intermediates of falcipain-3 are much longer lived than those of falcipain-2 (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Adding to these data, our new studies show that falcipain-3 is transported to the food vacuole with slower kinetics than is falcipain-2, such that falcipain-3 localizes much more commonly to subcellular structures (also seen with labeling of native falcipain-3) (12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 139: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that likely represent vesicles containing trafficking intermediates. Using point mutations we demonstrated that lysines in the lumenal targeting motif contribute toward proper and efficient targeting to the food vacuole. These positively charged amino acids might be crucial for the structural stability of the prodomain and/or its interactions with proteins required for proper trafficking. Similarly, positively charged residues play a key role in trafficking the cysteine protease cruzain to the lysosome/endosome compartment in the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (28Huete-Perez J.A. Engel J.C. Brinen L.S. Mottram J.C. McKerrow J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16249-16256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the cytoplasmic side of the falcipain-2 prodomain, a Phe-Val motif between residues 15 and 25 is conserved across homologues of falcipains (Fig. 7a). A hydrophobic trafficking motif, YXXϕ, on the cytoplasmic side of membrane proteins has been shown to bind to adaptor molecules, which traffic proteins to lysosomal and endosomal compartments (21Robinson M.S. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), but this motif is not found in falcipains. Alternatively, the Phe-Val motif of falcipains might interact with receptors or adaptors to be targeted to the food vacuole. It is not clear whether similar mechanisms of targeting apply to other P. falciparum food vacuole proteins. In the case of aspartic proteases, plasmepsin II appears to follow a similar pathway, with evidence for transit through the cytostome (23Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), but similarities of prodomain sequences at sites shown to be important for falcipain trafficking are not obvious. A recent report showed that the first 70 amino acids of plasmepsin IV (including 39 cytoplasmic, 20 transmembrane, and 11 lumenal residues) are sufficient for food vacuolar targeting (29Kuhn Y. Rohrbach P. Lanzer M. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It is possible that both cytoplasmic and lumenal motifs are also required for targeting of plasmepsin IV, but additional studies will be needed for full characterization of plasmepsin-trafficking motifs. Our results suggest a model for the trafficking of falcipains. As expected, the transmembrane domains of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are required for entry into the endoplasmic reticulum and secretory pathway; absence of transmembrane domains led to localization of GFP chimeras to the cytoplasm. Once in the endoplasmic reticulum, the proteins appear to traffic to the plasma membrane. At the plasma membrane falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 appear to be endocytosed in a process requiring the presence of both cytoplasmic and lumenal prodomain-trafficking motifs, followed by vesicular transport to the food vacuole. Trafficking to the food vacuole via the plasma membrane was previously proposed for plasmepsin aspartic proteases (23Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our demonstration of arrest of trafficking mutants at the plasma membrane offers strong evidence that falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 similarly traverse the plasma membrane en route to the food vacuole. Evidence for our model is indirect, and it remains possible that falcipains are trafficked in a fashion similar to that of vacuolar proteins in yeast, with targeting from the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi to food vacuole (20Mullins C. Bonifacino J.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and that a defect in sorting at the Golgi led to plasma membrane localization of some of our constructs. However, arguing for our model, with wild type proFP2-GFP, and more often with wild type proFP3-GFP, some localization in cytostome-like vesicular structures on the plasma membrane was seen in young parasites. Although further study will be needed to better characterize the architecture of these membrane structures, our results support the notion that the plasma membrane is an intermediary site of protein trafficking to the food vacuole. However, this route is apparently not taken by all food vacuolar proteins, as a recent study revealed that a newly identified food vacuolar protein, FCP (FVYE domain-containing protein), is trafficked to the food vacuole directly from the cytoplasm (30McIntosh M.T. Vaid A. Hosgood H.D. Vijay J. Bhattacharya A. Sahani M.H. Baevova P. Joiner K.A. Sharma P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11499-11508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As seen earlier for a variety of GFP fusion proteins in P. falciparum (23Klemba M. Beatty W. Gluzman I. Goldberg D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 31Adisa A. Rug M. Klonis N. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), in addition to full-length fusion protein, we observed processed GFP in parasite extracts (supplemental Fig. S1). The cleavage of GFP was more pronounced in constructs that were localized to the food vacuole, suggesting that some GFP processing occurred in this organelle. GFP cleavage might lead to fluorescence at sites of transport of exclusively free GFP. However, localization of both GFP and native falcipain-2 in the food vacuole with a full profalcipain-2 construct (Fig. 1) and differential trafficking of other constructs, with many showing little food vacuole fluorescence, argue strongly that fluorescence was indicative of localization of falcipain-2 constructs and thus informative regarding trafficking determinants for the enzyme. We observed that mutant GFP chimeras that were arrested at the plasma membrane during the trophozoite stage of the life cycle were found in the food vacuole in mature schizonts. Our results suggest that trafficking to the food vacuole in late schizonts was via a default pathway that likely traffics many proteins to this organelle for hydrolysis prior to completion of the erythrocytic cycle. Importantly, it is the trafficking of falcipains in trophozoites and early schizonts that is most relevant for parasite metabolism, as expression of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 and hemoglobin hydrolysis occur primarily at these stages (11Sijwali P.S. Shenai B.R. Gut J. Singh A. Rosenthal P.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 481-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 12Dahl E.L. Rosenthal P.J. Mol. Biochem.

Similarly, some (presumably default) trafficking to the food vacuole has also been seen with PfEXP1, a parasitophorous vacuolar protein (31Adisa A. Rug M. Klonis N. Foley M. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6532-6542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and PfEMP1, a protein targeted to the erythrocyte plasma membrane (33Wickham M.E. Rug M. Ralph S.A. Klonis N. McFadden G.I. Tilley L. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5636-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The trafficking constructs evaluated in this study included a number with an unusual phenotype, with localization in a patchy configuration apparently contiguous with the plasma membrane. This phenotype was distinct from that of other constructs that demonstrated diffuse membrane localization. This result suggests that the P. falciparum plasma membrane may have a more complex architecture than is currently appreciated, with accumulation of trafficking intermediates at discrete sites, perhaps overlapping with cytostomes that are taking up erythrocytic contents or with ports that mediate cargo-specific endocytosis. It is also possible that proteins are held in these structures by cytoskeletal molecules. Interestingly, this localization pattern requires an intact C terminus of the prodomain, as this phenotype was seen only in point mutants and internal deletion constructs, whereas truncated fusion proteins distributed uniformly through the plasma membrane. Therefore, it is possible that the C-terminal portion of the prodomain might interact with proteins that anchor falcipains to patches on the membrane as a prerequisite to transport to the food vacuole. In any event, our results suggest that molecules that inhibit falcipain trafficking might inhibit parasite development by blocking hemoglobin hydrolysis, as is the case with inhibitors of the enzymatic functions of falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 (7Rosenthal P.J. Rosenthal P.J. Anti-malarial Chemotherapy: Mechanisms of Action, Resistance, and New Direction in Drug Discovery. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2001: 3-13Google Scholar). If targeting signals or pathways are shared by other proteins, disruption of trafficking may engender marked antiparasitic effects. Thus, further exploration of mechanisms by which proteins are trafficked to the P. falciparum food vacuole may identify targets for novel means of antimalarial chemotherapy.

https://openalex.org/W2106008915,"One mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in vivo involves reversible dissociation into its component V1 and V0 domains, which in yeast occurs in response to glucose depletion. V-ATPase complexes containing the Vph1p isoform of subunit a (VCC) are targeted to the vacuole, and Stv1p-containing complexes (SCC) are targeted to the Golgi. Overexpression of Stv1p results in mistargeting of SCC to the vacuole. We have investigated the role of the a subunit isoform and cellular environment in controlling dissociation using vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants that accumulate proteins in either the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) (vps27Δ) or a post-Golgi compartment (PGC) (vps21Δ). Dissociation of both VCC and SCC depends upon cellular environment, with dissociation most complete in the vacuole and least complete in the PVC. The dependence of dissociation on V-ATPase activity was also investigated using both concanamycin and inactivating mutations. Concanamycin partly blocks dissociation of both VCC and SCC in all three compartments, with inhibition generally greater for SCC than VCC. The R735Q mutant of Vph1p results in loss of both ATPase and proton transport, whereas the R735K mutant lacks proton transport but has 10% of wild type ATPase activity. For VCC in the vacuole, dissociation is completely blocked for the R735Q but not the R735K mutant. Significant dissociation of VCC is observed for both mutants in the PVC and PGC, indicating that V-ATPase activity is not absolutely required for dissociation. Similar results were obtained for SCC, although dissociation of SCC is again generally more sensitive to activity than VCC. These results suggest that the cellular environment is important both in controlling in vivo dissociation of the V-ATPase and the dependence of this process on catalytic activity.

Within intracellular compartments, V-ATPases function in receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular membrane traffic, degradation and processing of proteins, and coupled transport of small molecules, such as neurotransmitters. They also assist in the entry of envelope viruses, such as influenza virus, and the killing of cells by toxins, such as diphtheria toxin and anthrax toxin (5Abrami L. Lindsay M. Parton R.G.

V-ATPases are composed of a peripheral V1 complex consisting of eight subunits (A–H) that hydrolyzes ATP and an integral V0 complex consisting of six subunits (a, d, e, c, c′, and c″) that conducts protons (1Nishi T.

The V0 complex includes a ring of proteolipid subunits (c, c′, and c″) onto which subunit d sits (11Iwata M. Imamura H. Stambouli E. Ikeda C. Tamakoshi M. Nagata K. Makyio H. Hankamer B. Barber J.

Subunit a is a 100-kDa protein composed of a hydrophilic amino terminus and a hydrophobic carboxyl terminus that is in contact with the proteolipid ring (12Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J.

Subunit a is also important for targeting the V-ATPase to different membranes in the cell. In yeast there are two isoforms of subunit a, Vph1p and Stv1p (15Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A.

Vph1p targets V-ATPases to the vacuole, whereas Stv1p causes V-ATPases to be retained in the Golgi (16Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Jones E.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 47411-47420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In a strain disrupted in both Vph1p and Stv1p, overexpression of Stv1p results in the appearance of a significant number of Stv1p-containing complexes in the vacuole (16Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D.

Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the vacuole show lower assembly of V0 and V1 as well as a 4-fold lower coupling of proton transport to ATP hydrolysis relative to Vph1p-containing complexes (17Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In mammals there are four isoforms of subunit a (a1–a4) (6Toyomura T.

The a3 isoform is present in the plasma membrane of osteoclasts, and mutations in the a3 gene cause the disease osteopetrosis (21Frattini A. Orchard P.J. Sobacchi C. Giliani S. Abinun M.

The a4 isoform is expressed in the plasma membrane of renal intercalated cells, and mutations cause the disease renal tubule acidosis (22Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S.

An important mechanism of controlling V-ATPase activity in vivo involves reversible dissociation of the V1 and V0 domains (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Reversible dissociation has been shown to regulate V-ATPase activity in both yeast and insect cells (23Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sumner J.P. Dow J.A. Earley F.G. Klein U. Jager D. Wieczorek H. J. Biol.

Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and in dendritic cells (26Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), where V-ATPases are essential for antigen processing. A distinctive feature of dissociation of V-ATPases is that the free V1 domain does not hydrolyze MgATP (27Parra K.J. Keenan K.L. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21761-21767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and free V0 is not passively permeable to protons (28Zhang J. Myers M. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9773-9778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This property is essential to avoid generation of an uncoupled ATPase activity in the cytosol or an unregulated passive proton conductance in cellular membranes. In yeast, dissociation of V-ATPase complexes is induced by glucose depletion, occurs rapidly and reversibly, and does not require new protein synthesis (23Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various signaling pathways involved in response to glucose depletion appear not to be involved in this process (29Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although dissociation (but not reassembly) requires an intact microtubular network (30Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24855-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By contrast, reassembly (but not dissociation) requires a novel cytoplasmic complex termed RAVE, which is also important for normal assembly of the V-ATPase (31Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 32Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus dissociation and reassembly appear to be independently controlled processes. Dissociation has also been shown to require catalytic activity (29Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to be blocked by chloroquine, which neutralizes internal acidic compartments (33Shao E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48663-48670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Previous results from our laboratory have shown that Vph1p-containing complexes localized to the vacuole undergo glucose-dependent dissociation, whereas Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the Golgi do not (17Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By contrast, Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the vacuole do show dissociation. Trafficking of Vph1p-containing complexes to the vacuole can be blocked using vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants. Strains disrupted in VPS27 accumulate proteins (including Vph1p) in a prevacuolar compartment (PVC), whereas vps21 mutants retain proteins (including Vph1p) in a post-Golgi compartment (34Gerrard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Vph1p-containing complexes localized to the PVC or post-Golgi compartments showed glucose-dependent dissociation but less completely than when localized to the vacuole (17Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To determine whether the a subunit isoform plays any role in controlling in vivo dissociation, we have now examined the dissociation behavior of both Vph1p- and Stv1p-containing complexes in wild type, vps21Δ, and vps27Δ strains. The dependence of dissociation on activity has also been examined in these strains. The results suggest that the intracellular environment plays an important role in controlling both dissociation behavior and its dependence on activity.

Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium or synthetic dropout medium (35Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 3-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Yeast Gene Replacement—The strains MM112 vps21Δ and MM112 vps27Δ were constructed following the protocol of two-step gene disruption (36Johnston M. Riles L. Hegemann J.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 290-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The VPS21 and VPS27 genes were replaced by homologous recombination in MM112 by the marker gene Kanr, and the strains MM112 vps21Δ and MM112 vps27Δ were selected using media containing the antibiotic G418. Transformation and Selection—The single copy plasmid pRS316 carrying the HA-VPH1 sequence (pRS316-VPH1::HA, also called pSKN12) or the HA-STV1 sequence (pRS316-STV1::HA, also called pSKN11) and the high copy plasmid YEp352 carrying HA-Stv1p (YEp352-STV1::HA, also called pSKN14) were constructed previously (17Kawasaki-Nishi S.

Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). The transformants were selected on uracil minus (Ura–) plates. For co-transformation of yeast strains with HA-Stv1p and untagged Vph1p, the VPH1 gene was subcloned into pRS413, a vector containing the HIS3 selectable marker. A yeast strain carrying pSKN14 was transformed with pRS413-Vph1p and then selected on uracil and histidine minus (Ura–His–) plates. Construction of Mutants—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce mutations R795K and R795Q on EcoRI-BamHI fragments of the HA-Stv1p using the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega). The mutagenic oligonucleotides are designed as 5′-CATCATATCTACAACTTTGGGCACTA-3′ and 5′-AGCATCATATCTAAAACTTTGGGCACTAT-3′ for R795Q and R795K, respectively. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fragments containing the indicated mutations were then substituted back into the pSKN14 (YEp352-STV1::HA). Cloned plasmids were again confirmed by DNA sequencing. The EcoRI-BamHI region of HA-Vph1p was substituted by the corresponding sequence from either the R735Q or R735K mutant of Vph1p constructed previously (38Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Vivo Dissociation of Yeast V-ATPases in Response to Glucose Deprivation—In vivo dissociation of yeast V-ATPases was induced by glucose deprivation as described before (23Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. The yeast strains MM112, MM112 vps21Δ, and MM112 vps27Δ expressing either normal levels of Vph1p (using pSKN12) or high levels of Stv1p (using pSKN14) were grown overnight, diluted in fresh media to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.1–0.2, and grown to an absorbance of 0.6–0.8. Cells were harvested and converted to spheroplasts by addition of 0.3 mg/ml Zymolyase in lysis buffer (YEPD, 0.1 m Tris/MES, pH 7.5, 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Cells were then split into 2 aliquots and incubated in YEP (without glucose) and YEPD medium (with 2% glucose) at 30 °C for 15 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted and lysed in PBS, pH 7.2 containing 1% C12E9, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate). For concanamycin A inhibition experiments, the inhibitor was added to the medium to a final concentration of 1 μm in the final 10 min of spheroplasting and then kept at this concentration until spheroplasts were lysed. V-ATPase complexes were immunoprecipitated from the lysate using the antibody 8B1 against subunit A and protein A-Sepharose followed by electrophoresis on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was then performed using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody 3F10 against HA to blot the a subunit of the V0 domain or the antibody 8B1 against the A subunit to blot the V1 domain followed by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Dissociation of the V-ATPase complex is reflected as a reduction in the amount of subunit a (in V0 complexes) co-immunoprecipitated by the antibody directed against subunit A (in the V1 complexes). Densitometry analysis was performed using the software ImageJ (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). To determine the linearity of the signal obtained in the Western blotting experiments, a titration was performed analyzing the signal obtained with varying amounts of the immunoprecipitates using both the anti-HA and anti-A subunit antibodies. Over the intensity range employed in these experiments (relative intensities of ∼1,000 to 16,000 units), the signal obtained was linear with the amount of HA-Vph1p loaded but showed some deviation from linearity for subunit A. This may be because detection of subunit A involved both a primary antibody (8B1) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, whereas detection of HA-Vph1p was done directly using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-HA antibody (3F10), eliminating the necessity of a secondary antibody. Quantitation of assembly was done by measuring the amount of subunit a precipitated, which was linear. The slight nonlinearity of signal with the amount of subunit A was not a problem because samples were matched for the amount of subunit A within a given experiment and nearly matched between experiments. Immunoisolation of Compartments Carrying HA-Stv1p—The strains MM112, MM112 vps27Δ, and MM112 vps21Δ were cotransformed with pPRS413-VPH1 and YEp352-STV1::HA, cultured, harvested, and converted to spheroplasts as described under the procedure for measurement of in vivo dissociation. Spheroplasts were lysed by osmotic shock in the absence of detergent in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% glycerol), followed by sedimentation twice for 1 min at 3,000 × g to remove unbroken cells and nuclei. Supernatants were precleared by addition of protein G-agarose, incubation for 1 h, and sedimentation at 3,000 × g for 1 min. Supernatants were then incubated with the anti-HA antibody (3F10) plus protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. The compartments carrying HA-Stv1p were then precipitated by sedimentation, and the proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of both HA-Stv1p and Vph1p in the immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibodies against HA (3F10) and Vph1p (10D7), respectively. Other Procedures—Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated using the protocol described previously (39Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Quinacrine staining of yeast was performed as described previously (40Conibear E. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 408-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a coupled spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A as described previously (33Shao E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48663-48670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent proton transport was measured in transport buffer (25 mm MES/Tris, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2) using the fluorescence probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin, as described previously (42Feng Y.

Stv1p-containing Complexes Localized to the Golgi Show Reduced Assembly with V1 Relative to Vph1p-containing Complexes Localized to the Vacuole—Previous results from our laboratory have demonstrated that V0 complexes containing the Stv1p isoform of subunit a, when localized to the vacuole through overexpression, showed significantly lower levels of assembly with the V1 domain than V0 complexes containing Vph1p, thus giving rise to the ∼10-fold difference in ATPase activity for these two complexes (17Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because the vacuolar environment is different in a number of respects from that of the Golgi, it was of interest to determine whether this reduced assembly with V1 was also observed for Stv1p-containing complexes present in their normal cellular environment, namely the Golgi. HA-tagged Stv1p was expressed at low levels in the yeast strain MM112 using the single copy plasmid pRS316. As a control, HA-tagged Vph1p was also expressed in MM112 using the same plasmid. Complexes containing either HA-Vph1p or HA-Stv1p were immunoprecipitated using the antibody 3F10 directed against the HA tag. After SDS-PAGE, the precipitants were Western blotted using the anti-HA antibody and an antibody directed against subunit A of the V1 domain. Because subunit A is co-immunoprecipitated with subunit a only when the V1 and V0 domains are assembled, the amount of subunit A precipitated using the anti-HA antibody is a reflection of the degree of assembly of the V1 and V0 domains. As can be seen in Fig. 1 (left two lanes), Vph1p-containing complexes localized to the vacuole show much better assembly with V1 than do Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the Golgi. Thus, the difference in assembly behavior of Vph1p- and Stv1p-containing complexes is not an artifact of mislocalization of Stv1p to the vacuole. For comparison, the degree of assembly of Stv1p localized to the vacuole through overexpression is also shown (Fig. 1, 3rd lane). For this experiment, the amount of antibody used to precipitate HA is limiting, such that no significant difference between the HA signal in the 2nd and 3rd lanes of Fig. 1 is observed. To determine whether Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the Golgi might be unstable during solubilization and immunoprecipitation, the experiments were repeated in the presence of the specific V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin, which has been shown to inhibit both Vph1p and Stv1p-containing V-ATPases (17Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17941-17948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1 (4th and 5th lanes), the difference in assembly of Vph1p-containing complexes in the vacuole and Stv1p-containing complexes localized to the Golgi was observed even in the presence of concanamycin, although Stv1p-containing complexes in the vacuole s"

But how do such bacteria rapidly down-regulate an activated FBPase in order to avoid futile cycling? Demonstrated here is the allosteric inhibition of E. coli FBPase by glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P), the first metabolite produced upon glucose transport into the cell. FBPase undergoes a quaternary transition from the canonical R-state to a T-like state in response to Glc-6-P and AMP ligation. By displacing Phe15, AMP binds to an allosteric site comparable with that of mammalian FBPase. Relative movements in helices H1 and H2 perturb allosteric activator sites for phosphoenolpyruvate. Glc-6-P binds to allosteric sites heretofore not observed in previous structures, perturbing subunits that in pairs form complete active sites of FBPase. Glc-6-P and AMP are synergistic inhibitors of E. coli FBPase, placing AMP/Glc-6-P inhibition in bacteria as a possible evolutionary predecessor to AMP/fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition in mammalian FBPases.

Moreover, concentrations of PEP rise coordinately with the availability of nonglucose nutrients (20Franzen J.S. Binkley S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 236: 515-519Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But then how does E. coli respond to a sudden influx of glucose? Eukaryotic organisms produce Fru-2,6-P2 to activate PFK and inhibit FBPase. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for instance, produces inhibitory levels of Fru-2,6-P2 within 1 min of glucose exposure (22Lederer B. Vissers S. Van Schaftingen E. Hers H.-G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Heterotrophic bacteria, such as E. coli, however, have no known mechanism for the rapid inhibition of FBPase in response to a sudden influx of glucose. Glucose is immediately phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) upon transport into the bacterial cell via the action of either the PEP phosphotransferase system or glucokinase (23Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 189-198Google Scholar). Glc-6-P levels vary as much as 10-fold between E. coli grown on different carbon sources and can rapidly fluctuate 5–7-fold in response to nutrient availability (21Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glc-6-P, being downstream of the FBPase reaction and subject to nutrient-induced variations in concentration, has the desired attributes of a dynamic regulator of FBPase. A mutant strain of E. coli, lacking phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, accumulates large amounts of intracellular Glc-6-P (∼50 mm, normal range 0.2–2 mm); its failure to grow on glycerol suggests in vivo inhibition of gluconeogenesis by Glc-6-P (21Lowry O.H. Carter J. Ward J.B. Glaser L. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6511-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty percent inhibition of impure FBPase, however, required 10 mm Glc-6-P, undermining a physiological role for Glc-6-P in the regulation of FBPase (24Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate here the inhibition of purified E. coli FBPase (specific activity 1000-fold higher than that used in Ref. 24Fraenkel D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 6451-6457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at physiologically relevant concentrations of Glc-6-P. Moreover, Glc-6-P enhances AMP inhibition by as much as 10-fold, even in the presence of 1 mm PEP. The latter property might allow Glc-6-P to override PEP activation of gluconeogenesis. Glc-6-P binds to distinct allosteric sites never before observed in FBPase structures, shearing subunits that pair off in forming complete active sites. E. coli FBPase, ligated by Glc-6-P and AMP, is in a T-like state, similar to the IT-state of the porcine enzyme. AMP displaces the side chain of Phe15 and axially dislocates helices H1 and H2 in opposite directions. Helix displacement distorts the PEP activation site, destabilizes the R-state, and allows Arg80 to stabilize the T-like state through its interaction with Glu6 from a symmetry-related subunit. Arg80 and Glu6 are conserved in organisms possessing signature residues of the PEP and Glc-6-P sites. Similarities between Glc-6-P and Fru-2,6-P2 inhibition suggest an evolutionary linkage; both inhibitors are one-reaction products of Fru-6-P, and both inhibit their respective FBPases synergistically with AMP. Materials—Fru-1,6-P2, Glc-6-P, Fru-6-P, AMP, NADP+, and ammonium molybdate came from Sigma; PEP was from MP Biomedicals; and zinc acetate, ascorbic acid, and sulfuric acid were from Fisher. 1,5-Anhydro-d-glucitol 6-phosphate (AnG6P) was synthesized from 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol (Toronto Research Chemicals) and quantified as previously described (25Ferrari R.A.

All other chemicals were of reagent grade. Enzyme Isolation and Purity—Native and selenomethionine-substituted E. coli FBPases, prepared as previously described (7Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B.

Preparations of selenomethionine-substituted enzyme were used for structure determinations and native enzyme for kinetics. Purified enzymes migrate as single bands on SDS-PAGE, have specific activities of 35–40 units/mg, and have a single residue type (methionine or selenomethionine) at the N terminus. Kinetic Experiments—Assays of E. coli FBPase use coupling enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and monitor the formation of NADPH at 22 °C by either fluorescence emission at 470 nm or absorbance at 340 nm (13Iancu C.V.

Assay mixtures (total volume, 2 ml) included 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 μm EDTA, and 150 μm NADP+ with up to saturating levels of Fru-1,6-P2 (40 μm) and MgCl2 (10 mm). Assays were initiated either by the addition of 1.4 μg of enzyme (enzyme-initiated assays) or by incubating the enzyme in assay mixtures for 1 h at 22 °C without MgCl2 and then initiating the reaction by the addition of metal (enzyme incubation assays). Glc-6-P is an intermediate in the coupled assay. Hence, studies of Glc-6-P inhibition monitor FBPase turnover by the evolution of Pi (26Drueckes P. Schinzel R. Palm D. Anal.

Assay mixtures (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Fru-1,6-P2, 0.75 μg of enzyme, and varying amounts of PEP, AMP, and Glc-6-P in a total volume of 60 μl) were incubated in 96-well microtiter plates (Evergreen) at 25 °C for 1 h prior to the initiation of the reaction by the addition of 5 mm MgCl2. The addition of 250 μl of reducing agent at fixed intervals quenched reactions. Plates were sealed and incubated at 25 °C for at least 2 h to allow color development. Absorbances (λ = 655 nm) were measured on a Bio-Rad Benchmark microplate reader. Blank-corrected standard curves relating A655 to [Pi] (0–1.5 mm) were linear (R2 > 0.998). Determinations of kinetic mechanism require low concentrations of substrate and result in levels of Pi undetectable by the phosphate release assay. Such determinations employed the coupled assay with AnG6P as the inhibitor. AnG6P does not interfere with enzymes of the coupled assay (25Ferrari R.A. Mandelstam P. Crane R.K. Arch. Biochem.

Initial rate data taken at saturating substrate, fixed effector, and systematically varied inhibitor concentrations were fit to a Hill equation, V=V∞+(Vmax−V∞)/((I/I0.5)n+1)Eq. 1 where I represents the inhibitor concentration; V, Vmax, and V∞ are the velocity, maximum velocity (at I = 0), and the limiting velocity (at I saturating); n is the Hill coefficient associated with the inhibitor; and I0.5 is the inhibitor concentration at 50% inhibition. Data taken from experiments in which inhibitor/substrate or inhibitor/metal concentrations were varied systematically were fit to rapid equilibrium models for competitive, uncompetitive, noncompetitive, and mixed inhibition, fixing the Hill coefficient of the ligand (n = 1or n = 2) as circumstances dictate. AMP behaves cooperatively (n = 2) in enzyme-initiated assays or in the presence of PEP and noncooperatively (n = 1) in enzyme incubation assays in the absence of PEP (8Hines J.H. Fromm H.J.

Estimates of in vivo metabolite concentrations in E. coli were determined as previously described (8Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Crystallization of the AMP·Glc-6-P Complex—Crystals were grown by hanging drop in vapor diffusion VDX plates (Hampton Research). Solutions of sucrose and polyethylene glycol had 0.05% (w/v) NaN3 to reduce microbial growth. All other solutions were sterile filtered prior to use. AMP/Glc-6-P-bound FBPase crystals grew from droplets containing 2 μl of a protein solution (15 mg/ml enzyme, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Fru-1,6-P2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm AMP) and 2 μlof a precipitant solution (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, 13% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000, and 20% (w/v) sucrose) and were equilibrated over 500 μl of precipitant solution. All components of the protein solution were combined, except AMP, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, allowing for the enzyme-catalyzed equilibration of Fru-1,6-P2, Fru-6-P, and Glc-6-P prior to the addition of AMP. (FBPase isolated as described here has endogenous phosphoglucose isomerase activity that produces Glc-6-P from Fru-6-P. Purifying a C-terminal polyhistidyl-tagged FBPase on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Novagen) removes the trace impurity, but the tagged FBPase has undetermined properties of crystallization). 4J. K. Hines and R. B. Honzatko, unpublished observations. Rodlike crystals (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.8 mm) grew within 3 days at 22 °C. Crystals were cryoprotected by immersion for 60 s in a solution of 18% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000, 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.5, supplemented with dithiothreitol, EDTA, and ligands immediately prior to freezing in a cold stream of nitrogen. Data Collection—Crystals were screened at Iowa State University on a Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ rotating anode/image plate system using CuKα radiation from an Osmic confocal optics system at a temperature of 110 K. Data were collected from a single crystal at 100 K on Beamline 4.2.2 of the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The program d*trek (28Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar) was used to index, integrate, scale, and merge intensities, which were then converted to structure factors using the CCP4 (29Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr.

Structure Determination and Refinement—The program AMORE (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Manual adjustments in the conformation of specific residues employed the program XTALVIEW (32McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The initial model underwent simulated annealing from 3000 to 300 K in steps of 25 K, followed by 100 cycles of energy minimization and thermal parameter refinement using CNS (33Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Restraints for thermal parameter refinement were as follows: 1.5 Å2 for bonded main-chain atoms, 2.0 Å2 for angle main-chain atoms and angle side-chain atoms, and 2.5 Å2 for angle side-chain atoms. Ligands (Fru-1,6-P2, Glc-6-P, AMP, Mg2+, HPO2–4, and Cl–) and water molecules were fit to omit electron density until no improvement in Rfree was evident. Water molecules with thermal parameters above 60 Å2 or more than 3.2 Å from the nearest hydrogen bonding partner were removed from the final model. Structure and Sequence Comparisons of FBPases—Tetramer models of E. coli and porcine FBPases were constructed from crystallographic asymmetric units and used in pairwise superpositions using the CCP4 programs PDBSET (35Evans P. PDBSET. Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar) and LSQKAB (36Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2345) Google Scholar). Displacements between Cα positions were measured using XTALVIEW (32McRee D.E. J. Mol. Graph. 1992; 10: 44-46Crossref Google Scholar). The canonical R- and T-states of porcine FBPase have Protein Data Bank identifiers 1CNQ and 1EYK, respectively, whereas the IT- and IR-states have identifiers 1Q9D and 1YYZ. The measured angle of rotation between subunit pairs is sensitive to the set of residues used in the superposition. Hence, previously established residues employed in the comparison of E. coli and porcine FBPases were used for alignments (7Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18386-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments of Type I FBPases employed the program ClustalW (37Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55635) Google Scholar). Inhibition of E. coli FBPase by Glc-6-P and AMP—AMP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of E. coli FBPase with respect to the substrate Fru-1,6-P2 under all methods of assay and in the presence or absence of PEP. Ki values range from 2 to 100μm, being sensitive to the conditions of assay and PEP concentration. At saturating concentrations of Fru-1,6-P2 (40 μm) and in the presence of 1 mm PEP, AMP inhibition is mixed with respect to Mg2+. The constant of dissociation for AMP from the enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2 complex (Ki = 13 ± 3μm) is 7-fold less than that for the dissociation of AMP from the enzyme·Fru-1,6-P2·Mg2+ complex (Kis = 94 ± 10 μm). (AMP is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Mg2+ for porcine FBPase (38Liu F. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7401-7406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) The determination of the kinetic mechanism of Glc-6-P inhibition employed the coupled assay and the analog AnG6P (which inhibits with 5–10-fold lower affinity than Glc-6-P). In assays with Fru-1,6-P2 or Mg2+ at saturating concentrations and 1 mm PEP, AnG6P inhibited E. coli FBPase noncompetitively with respect to both Fru-1,6-P2 (Ki = Kis = 660 ± 70 μm) and Mg2+ (Ki = Kis = 850 ± 70 μm). Glc-6-P inhibition, as measured by the phosphate release assay, varied with fixed concentrations of PEP and AMP (Fig. 1 and Table 1). PEP antagonizes AMP and Glc-6-P inhibition. I0.5 values for Glc-6-P and AMP inhibition increase 10- and 4-fold, respectively, over a range of 0–1 mm PEP. 500 μm Glc-6-P enhances AMP inhibition by 10-fold.TABLE 1I0.5 values for the inhibition of E. coli FBPase by AMP and Glc-6-P[PEP]I0.5 AMPI0.5 AMP with 500 μm Glc-6-PI0.5 Glc-6-Pμmμmμmμm08 ± 26 ± 138 ± 65012 ± 24 ± 1100 ± 20100031 ± 73 ± 2340 ± 40 Open table in a new tab Structure of the AMP·Glc-6-P Complex of E. coli FBPase (Protein Data Bank Accession Code 2Q8M)—Crystals belong to the space group P4122 (a = b = 124.6, c = 132.3 Å) with a C1–C4 dimer pair in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Additional subunits related by crystallographic symmetry complete the biological tetramer. Four AMP and two Glc-6-P molecules bind in full occupancy to the tetramer. AMP molecules are at allosteric sites corresponding to those of the porcine tetramer (10Zhang Y. Liang J.-Y. Huang S. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas Glc-6-P molecules bind at allosteric sites that incorporate a 2-fold axis of molecular/crystallographic symmetry. Hence, Glc-6-P in the model adopts mutually exclusive modes of binding related by symmetry (Fig. 2). Chloride ions (a total of six per tetramer) and water molecules occupy conformationally altered sites associated with PEP activation in the R-state (8Hines J.H. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11696-11704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fru-1,6-P2 and two Mg2+ are in each active site. The electron density for the 1-phosphoryl groups and Mg2+, however, is less robust than that for the rest of the ligand. A mixture of Fru-1,6-P2 and Fru-6-P probably binds to the active site. To reflect this circumstance, occupancy factors for 1-phosphoryl groups and Mg2+ are set to 0.5. Magnesium ions occupy loci analogous to metal sites 1 and 2 of porcine FBPase (39Choe J.-Y. Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11441-11450Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and have five and six coordinating oxygen atoms, respectively. A complete list of protein ligand interactions appears in Table 3. The model does not include residues 46–67 (most of the dynamic loop and the N-terminal end of helix H3) due to the absence of interpretable electron density; however, residues 42–46 at the N-terminal end of the loop occupy a position consistent with the disengaged conformation of the dynamic loop in T-state models of porcine FBPase (40Choe J.-Y.

The cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins were attached to full-length (T4) and caspase-cleaved (T4C3) tau at either the N or C termini, and a pair of cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged tau were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney cells. The FRET efficiency was examined in the presence of a constitutively active or a kinase-dead GSK3β. Active GSK3β significantly increased FRET efficiency with both T4 and T4C3, indicating that GSK3β activation resulted in an increase in the self-association of both T4 and T4C3, but interestingly only T4 is efficiently phosphorylated by GSK3β. There was no significant difference in FRET efficiency between T4 and T4C3, although only T4C3 in the presence of active GSK3β leads to the formation of Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions. These FRET studies demonstrate that GSK3β facilitates the association of T4 and T4C3, and the presence of caspase-cleaved tau is necessary for the evolution of tau oligomers into Sarkosyl-insoluble inclusions even though it is not extensively phosphorylated.

Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1121-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (2162) Google Scholar). NFTs are mainly composed of paired helical filaments (PHFs), which are formed from abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (2Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Tung Y.C. Quinlan M. Wisniewski H.M. Binder L.I.

Sliwinski M.J. Buschke H. Katz M. Crystal H. Lipton R.B. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), the role of NFTs as toxic mediators of neuronal dysfunction and death is still not clear. Several animal models show cognitive deficits and impaired axonal transport in the absence of NFTs (5Stamer K. Vogel R. Thies E. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. J.

Furthermore, suppression of tau expression in a transgenic mouse model restored memory function and stabilized neuronal cell populations, whereas NFTs continued to accumulate (8Santacruz K. Lewis J. Spires T. Paulson J. Kotilinek L. Ingelsson M. Guimaraes A. DeTure M. Ramsden M. McGowan E. Forster C. Yue M. Orne J. Janus C. Mariash A. Kuskowski M. Hyman B. Hutton M. Ashe K.H. Science. 2005; 309: 476-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that NFTs are not sufficient to cause cognitive decline or neuronal death, and small soluble oligomers may be the toxic species (9Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the early steps in the process of tau oligomerization is of fundamental importance. Post-translational modifications of tau such as aberrant phosphorylation have been demonstrated to play a significant role in tau aggregate formation (10Ding H. Matthews T.A. Johnson G.V. J. Biol.

Zaidi M.S. Wisniewski H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6084-6089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro studies showed that hyperphosphorylated tau can self-assemble into PHFs (17Alonso A.C. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K.

For example, pseudophosphorylation of Ser396 and Ser404, as well as Ser205, Thr205, and Thr212, makes tau more fibrillogenic (19Abraha A. Ghoshal N. Gamblin T.C. Cryns V. Berry R.W. Kuret J.

Stieler J.T. Arendt T. Holzer M. J. Neurochem. 2004; 88: 1509-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is emerging evidence that glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) may play a major role in regulating tau phosphorylation in pathological conditions (22Phiel C.J. Wilson C.A. Lee V.M. Klein P.S.

Poon W.W. Blurton-Jones M. Oddo S. Torp R. Vitek M.P. LaFerla F.M. Rohn T.T. Cotman C.W. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to investigate how GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and caspase cleavage of tau contribute to the initiation of the tau aggregation process. In a previous study, it was demonstrated that tau truncated at Asp421 (T4C3), but not full-length tau (T4), partitioned into a Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction and formed thioflavin S-positive aggregates when co-expressed with GSK3β (36Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54716-54723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This indicates that a combination of phosphorylation and cleavage of tau may coordinate in regulating tau aggregation. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a process by which energy is transferred from a donor fluorophore (CFP) to an acceptor fluorophore (YFP) in a distance-dependent manner (typically 20–60 Å). FRET is one of the few tools available for measuring nanometer scale distances and changes in distances, both in vitro and in vivo (37Selvin P.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 38Truong K. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Karpova T.S.

Because FRET efficiency decreases as the inverse sixth power of distance, small distance and orientation changes between the donor and acceptor fluorophores can dramatically affect the FRET efficiency (40Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1978) Google Scholar). A number of applications using FRET to understand protein-protein interactions have been reported (38Truong K. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 41Rampino N. Yamamoto H. Ionov Y. Li Y. Sawai H. Reed J.C. Perucho M.

For example FRET has been used to detect the dimerization of a protein (44Toth P.T. Ren D. Miller R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2004; 310: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating that FRET can be used to evaluate the self-association of a protein. This study was undertaken to understand the intermolecular association of tau proteins in response to GSK3β activation and/or caspase cleavage. To achieve this goal FRET microscopy was used with full-length tau (T4) and caspase-cleaved (Asp421) tau (T4C3) to which CFP and YFP were linked. To evaluate different tau orientations during the intermolecular interactions of tau, N-terminally linked CFP (CFP-tau) was co-transfected with N-terminally linked YFP (YFP-tau) or C-terminally linked YFP (tau-YFP) for both T4 and T4C3 in the absence or presence of active GSK3β, and subsequent to quantitating FRET efficiency. The data from these studies demonstrate that activation of GSK3β results in an increase in the intermolecular association of both T4 and T4C3 tau. However, increased intermolecular association did not necessarily lead to the formation of insoluble tau aggregates, suggesting that although the increased intermolecular interaction is likely an early event in the formation of insoluble tau aggregates, tau may remain in an oligomeric state and not progress into an aggregate in the absence of other contributing cellular processes. Plasmid Constructs—To make the FRET constructs, PCR products of pECFP-C1 (Clontech) and pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) were cloned into NheI and KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to make the N-terminally linked CFP and YFP vectors, nCFP and nYFP vector, respectively. The PCR product of pEYFP-N1 (Clontech) was cloned into XbaI and ApaI sites pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) to make a C-terminally linked YFP vector, cYFP vector. To make a positive FRET control construct, a PCR product of pEYFP-N1 was cloned into XbaI and ApaI sites of nCFP vector (nCFP-YFP vector), and then a highly flexible linker domain, which consisted of Gly-Ser-Asp-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Thr-Ser (45Cabantous S. Terwilliger T.C. Waldo G.S. Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), was introduced into the vector to make nCFP-Linker-YFP. T4 containing human tau with four microtubule-binding repeats but without exons 2 and 3 and T4C3 with the last 20 amino acids deleted and thus mimicking caspase-cleaved tau (36Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54716-54723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) were introduced into KpnI and XbaI sites of the pcDNA3.1(+) FRET vectors to yield nCFP-tau, nYFP-tau, and tau-cYFP constructs. To make the tau-cYFP vectors, the stop codons of T4 and T4C3 were replaced with GGA before cloning into FRET vectors. All the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. GSK3β-S9A-HA, which is a constitutively active form of GSK3β, was constructed in pcDNA3.1, as described previously (46Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and the kinase-dead (kd)-GSK3β-HA construct, in which lysine residues at 85 and 86 were mutated to alanines, was a generous gift from G. Meares (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL) (47Meares G.P. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16989-17001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 5% bovine growth serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Cellgro). Cells at 50–70% confluency were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 48 h after transfection, the cells were collected and processed as described below for the different assays. Coverslip Preparation for FRET Microscopy—Forty eight hours after transfection, cells on the coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS and mounted. Coverslips were sealed with clear nail polish. FRET Microscopy—Intermolecular interaction of tau proteins was determined by the Acceptor Photobleaching method of FRET detection (37Selvin P.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar, 38Truong K. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 39Karpova T.S.

A Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica) was used to record the fluorescence of CFP and YFP both before and after selective photobleaching of 70% of the YFP acceptor fluorophore. CFP was excited by 458 nm light, and the emission was collected through a 465–500 nm bandpass filter (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). YFP was excited by 514 nm light and the emission was collect through a 525–600 nm bandpass filter (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Selective photobleaching of YFP was performed by repeatedly scanning a region of the specimen with the 514 nm laser line set at maximum intensity to photobleach at 70% of the original acceptor fluorescence. The fluorescence emission from the donor and the acceptor were collected using the Leica software. A Timed Bleach protocol was utilized to automate the acquisition of pre-bleach images, perform acceptor photobleaching of the acceptor, and acquisition of post-bleach images. The pre- and post-bleach images are saved as a single file that can be analyzed using measurement functions resident in the Leica software. Average fluorescence intensities of the donor are measured before and after bleaching, and the efficiency of FRET was calculated by ET = 1 -(IDA/ID) where IDA and ID represent the steady state donor fluorescence in the presence and the absence of the acceptor. Immunoblotting—Cells were collected in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40), containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. Lysates were sonicated briefly and centrifuged, and protein concentrations in the supernatants were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were diluted with 2× protein loading buffer (2× SDS stop buffer, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with the indicated antibodies. After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were used in this study. Tau5 (from Dr. L. Binder) and 5A6 are phospho-independent tau antibodies (48Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol.

Sarkosyl Fractionation Assay—The assay was carried out essentially as described previously (36Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol.

Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plate, collected by spinning at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in RAB buffer (100 mm Mes, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 750 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and then homogenized with 30 strokes using a tissue grinder. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected as the RAB fraction. The pellets were resuspended with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, sonicated briefly, and then incubated on ice for 30 min. The homogenates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatants were collected as RIPA fraction. The pellets were resuspended with RAB buffer (100 mm Mes, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgSO4, 750 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF) containing 1% N-lauroylsarcosine (Sarkosyl) in Mes buffer (20 mm Mes, pH 6.8, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 20 mm NaF) with protease inhibitors, vortexed for 30 min at room temperature, incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min (Airfuge) at room temperature. The supernatants (Sarkosyl-soluble fraction) were collected and diluted with 2× protein loading buffer, and the pellets (Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction) were resuspended in 2× protein loading buffer and incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and blotted with Tau5/5A6 antibodies. Statistics—Data were analyzed using Student’s t test, and values were considered significantly different when p was <0.05. Generation and Expression of FRET Tau Constructs—To determine the intermolecular interaction of tau proteins using FRET microscopy, CFP and YFP constructs, which were linked to full-length (T4) or tau truncated at Asp421 (T4C3) that mimics caspase-3 cleavage, were generated. To detect different orientations for the tau-tau interactions, YFP fluorophore was linked to the N terminus or C terminus of tau, whereas the CFP fluorophore was linked only to the N terminus of tau protein (Fig. 1). As a positive control for FRET, a flexible linker domain consisting of 12 amino acids was introduced between CFP and YFP (CFP-Linker-YFP in Fig. 1). HEK cells were transfected with these FRET constructs and immunoblotted to determine their expression levels (Fig. 2). The blots were probed with a green fluorescent protein antibody (Roche Applied Science), which also recognizes both CFP and YFP proteins (top panel in Fig. 2), and with the Tau5/5A6 antibodies, which recognize total tau (bottom panel in Fig. 2). Naive T4 not linked to a fluorophore was also run for comparison (Fig. 2). All the tau FRET constructs expressed at approximately equivalent levels. As expected, the T4C3 FRET proteins, which are 20 amino acids shorter than T4 FRET proteins, migrated faster than the T4 FRET proteins.FIGURE 2Cellular expression of FRET constructs. Fluorophore-linked tau and positive control constructs were transiently transfected into HEK cells. Blots were probed with GFP (top panel) and 5A6 (bottom panel) antibodies. Representative immunoblots with these antibodies showed that the different tau constructs were expressed at approximately equal levels, and linking of a fluorophore to tau reduced the electrophoretic mobility of the tau proteins as expected. The T4C3 FRET constructs migrated faster than the T4 FRET constructs. For molecular weight comparisons, naive T4, which was not linked to a fluorophore (far right band on blots), and CFP-linker-YFP, the positive FRET control construct (far left band on blots), were included in these blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Active GSK3β Increased Tau Intermolecular Interactions—To determine the intermolecular association of T4 or T4C3, CFP-tau was transiently co-transfected with YFP-tau or tau-YFP in the presence of active GSK3β or kd-GSK3β, and then FRET efficiency was measured. As a positive control in FRET microscopy, the CFP-linker-YFP construct was used (54Zhou J.Y. Toth P.T. Miller R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 305: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To determine the FRET efficiency, approximately half of a cell was selected as the region of interest to bleach, and the other half of the cell was used as background to obtain pure FRET efficiency. The net FRET values were calculated using the following equation: net FRET efficiency = FRET efficiency in acceptor-bleached area - FRET efficiency in the other half non-bleached area. The FRET efficiency in the nonbleached area was negligible in all groups. Representative FRET images are shown in Fig. 3, and quantitative analyses of FRET efficiency, which were obtained from three independent experiments, are presented in Fig. 4. The positive control CFP-Linker-YFP showed a FRET efficiency of 15.81 ± 1.46, and images of CFP and YFP with this construct completely overlapped as expected. Expression of active GSK3ββ resulted in significantly increased FRET efficiency with both T4 and T4C3 compared with kd-GSK3β, which indicates that active GSK3β increased intermolecular associations of both T4 and T4C3 (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). The arbitrary FRET efficiencies (mean ± S.E.) were as follows: 3.61 ± 0.21 and 5.89 ± 0.30 for CFP-T4 with YFP-T4 in the presence of active and kd-GSK3β, respectively; 3.63 ± 0.29 and 5.73 ± 0.52 for CFP-T4 with T4-YFP in the presence of active and kd-GSK3β, respectively; 2.94 ± 0.28 and 4.83 ± 0.68 for CFP-T4C3 with YFP-T4C3 in the presence of active and kd-GSK3β, respectively; and 2.98 ± 0.50 and 5.29 ± 0.70 for CFP-T4C3 with T4C3-YFP in the presence of active and kd-GSK3β, respectively (Fig. 4). However, there were no significant differences in the FRET intensity between YFP-tau and tau-YFP, which suggests that there is equivalent parallel and anti-parallel self-association of tau in situ.

Ferritin, composed of H and L subunits, is the major intracellular iron storage protein involved in iron homeostasis. We previously identified an enhancer, termed antioxidant-responsive element (ARE), in the human ferritin H gene and its respective transcriptional activators including Nrf2 and JunD. Here we found that ATF1 (activating transcription factor 1) is a transcriptional repressor of the ferritin H ARE. Subsequent yeast two-hybrid screening identified PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3) as an ATF1-binding protein. Further investigation of the human ferritin H ARE regulation showed that 1) PIAS3 reversed ATF1-mediated repression of the ferritin H ARE; 2) ATF1 was sumoylated, but PIAS3, a SUMO E3 ligase, did not appear to play a major role in SUMO1-mediated ATF1 sumoylation or ATF1 transcription activating function; 3) PIAS3 decreased ATF1 binding to the ARE; and 4) ATF1 knockdown with siRNA increased ferritin H expression, whereas PIAS3 knockdown decreased basal expression and oxidative stress-mediated induction of ferritin H. These results suggest that PIAS3 antagonizes the repressor function of ATF1, at least in part by blocking its DNA binding, and ultimately activates the ARE. Collectively our results suggest that PIAS3 is a new regulator of ATF1 that regulates the ARE-mediated transcription of the ferritin H gene.

Iron is a vital element that participates in numerous metabolic functions in all organisms; however, excess iron is harmful because it catalyzes formation of hydroxyl radicals by reacting with hydrogen peroxide in the Fenton chemistry (1Papanikolaou G. Pantopoulos K. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 202: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals as well as other reactive oxygen species potentially damage cellular components such as proteins, membrane lipids, and nucleic acids, which have been implicated in the etiology of many human diseases and disorders including neurode-generative disease, cancer, and aging (2Andersen J.K. Nat. Med. 2004; (suppl.) 10: S18-S25Crossref Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 3Hussain S.P. Hofseth L.J. Harris C.C. Nat. Rev.

Therefore, cells must tightly control cellular iron levels under various physiological conditions by storing excess iron in a nontoxic but bioavailable form. Ferritin is the major intracellular iron-binding protein comprised of 24 subunits of the heavy (H) and light (L) chains (5Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). The importance of ferritin is supported by its ubiquitous expression, highly conserved protein structure (6Arosio P. Levi S.

Beaumont C. Blood. 2001; 98: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The H subunit has ferroxidase activity, which is involved in the oxidation and incorporation of ferrous iron into the ferritin shell, whereas the L subunit plays a role in the formation of the iron core (6Arosio P.

Post-transcriptional regulation of ferritin and the transferrin receptor by iron was elegantly characterized by experiments that showed iron-regulated interactions between trans-acting iron regulatory proteins and iron-responsive elements in these mRNAs (9Klausner R.D.

Nrf2, a Cap’n’Collar basic region leucine zipper (b-Zip) family member, is also important for transcriptional activation of the ferritin H gene (27Pietsch E.C. Chan J.Y. Torti F.M. Torti S.V. J.

These b-Zip transcription factors regulate target genes by forming homodimers or heterodimers within the family, as well as with other b-Zip transcription factors such as Jun and Fos family members, on an AP1-binding sequence or a cAMP response element (35Mayr B.

Extensive studies that focused on characterization of transcription factors that directly bind to an ARE identified Nrf2 as the major ARE-activating proteins (22Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). By contrast, little is known about ARE repressors or involvement of transcriptional coregulators. Interaction of a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein Keap1 with Nrf2 was first reported by Yamamoto and co-workers (49Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2657) Google Scholar) and is the best characterized mechanism of ARE regulation (22Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Recruitment of coactivators, corepressors, and post-translational regulation of transcription factors are critical determinants of expression of target genes. One such regulatory protein, PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3), was originally identified as a specific inhibitor of the STAT3 signaling pathway (50Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence has shown that the PIAS family (PIAS1, PIAS3, PIASx, and PIASy) regulates a variety of cytokine/growth factor signaling pathways and transcription factors, including NF-κB and SMADs, through protein-protein interactions (51Shuai K. Liu B. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the PIAS family has a conserved RING finger-like zinc binding domain that is involved in SUMO-E3-ligase activity and regulates activity of transcription factors such as SMAD4 (52Ohshima T. Shimotohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50833-50842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) through sumoylation. We previously identified ATF1 as a binding protein of the mouse ferritin H ARE (30Tsuji Y. Torti S.V. Torti F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2984-2992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, the role of ATF1 and an ATF1 regulatory protein in ARE enhancer activity remained uncharacterized. In this study, we report that ATF1 is a repressor of the human ferritin H ARE and that PIAS3 is an ATF1-binding protein, which counteracts ATF1 repressor function by diminishing its DNA binding in vivo in a sumoylation-independent manner. These results suggest a new role for PIAS3 in the transcriptional regulation of ferritin and in iron metabolism. Cell Culture—K562 human erythroleukemia cells, purchased from ATCC, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 0.3g/liter l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, 35-010-CV; Mediatech). 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in minimum essential medium containing Earle’s balanced salt solution, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm l-glutamine and 10% FBS. These cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 condition. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse NIH3T3 pAct2 cDNA library (purchased from Clontech) was carried out using a full-length human ATF1 as bait with Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain PJ69-4A (MATa, trp1–901, leu2–3,112, ura3–52, his3–200, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, GAL2-ADE2, LYS2:GAL1-HIS3, met2:GAL7-LacZ) (53James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PJ69-4A was transformed with pGBDATF1 (cultured on tryptophan-deficient synthetic drop-out medium), and expression of a GAL4DBD-ATF1 fusion protein was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-ATF1 antibody. A single colony expressing the bait protein was transformed with 20 μg of the NIH3T3 library cDNA by successive treatment of the yeast strain with 0.1 m lithium acetate, 44% polyethylene glycol 3350 for 30 min at 30 °C and 10% Me2SO for 15 min at 42 °C. Yeast cells transformed with the cDNA library were plated on tryptophan/leucine/histidine-deficient synthetic drop-out agar medium containing 2 mm 3-aminotriazole. cDNA plasmids were recovered from 20 positive clones grown on the selection medium by mechanical extraction of plasmid DNA with glass beads (425–600 microns; Sigma) and transformation of Escherichia coli HB101 by electroporation (1300 V in 0.1-cm cuvette, BTX). HB101 transformed with the extracted cDNA were grown on M9/leucine-deficient agar media containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, followed by isolation of plasmid DNA, characterization with restriction enzymes, and DNA sequencing (SeqWright Co., Houston, TX). Two clones among the positive pool turned out to be identical, and both encoded the C-terminal region of mouse PIAS3. DNA Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—293 cells were transfected with pCMVHA-ATF1, pCMVFLAG-PIAS3, and/or pCMVT7-SUMO1 by electroporation (Bio-Rad X-Cell) using a preoptimized setting developed by Bio-Rad. To detect ATF1-PIAS3 interaction in the cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma) and protein A-agarose, followed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody (HA11; Covance). For human ferritin H-luciferase reporter assays, cloning of the human ferritin H5′ upstream enhancer/promoter region and construction of luciferase plasmids were reported previously (17Tsuji Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7567-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). 0.5–1 μg of a ferritin H luciferase plasmid containing ARE (–4.5 kb) or lacking ARE (–4.4 kb) was transiently transfected into K562 cells (1 × 107 cells/100 μl in a 0.2-cm gap cuvette) by electroporation (Bio-Rad X-Cell) or into 293 cells by JetPEI (according to the manufacturer’s instructions; polyplus transfection) along with ATF1 and/or PIAS3 expression plasmids. As a internal control for transfection, 20 ng of pRL-CMV or pRL-EF (elongation factor promoter) was simultaneously transfected. Transfected K562 cells were then plated at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/60-mm plate containing 4 ml of the culture medium. After incubation for 36–48 h, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using dual luciferase assay reagent (Promega). Firefly luciferase expression driven by the ferritin H gene was normalized to Renilla luciferase expression or, in some experiments, by protein concentration of the cell extracts. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Binding of transfected or endogenous ATF1 to the ferritin H ARE was assessed by ChIP assay as described previously (17Tsuji Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7567-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 K562 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of HA-tagged ATF1 expression plasmid for 40–48 h, followed by cross-linking chromatin with 1% formaldehyde and preparation of cell lysates using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate/Millipore). The cross-linked chromatin-DNA was sonicated with a Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher) for 12 cycles of pulses (10 s) and intervals (20 s). 1/10 aliquots of sonicated DNA were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of mouse IgG or anti-HA antibody (HA11; Covance), and semiquantitative PCR for the ferritin H ARE or a non-ARE region was performed using a primer set as shown below. Simultaneously 1/50 aliquots of each sonicated DNA were used for quantitative PCR to assess the amount of input DNA. To detect endogenous ATF1 binding to the ferritin H ARE, similar ChIP assays were performed using an ATF1-specific antibody (SC-243x; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To study the effect of PIAS3 on the binding of ATF1 to the ferritin H ARE, 1 μg of HA-tagged ATF1 expression plasmid was transfected into 1 × 107 K562 cells together with 0, 2, or 9 μg of pCMVFLAGPIAS3 by electroporation, and a HA-ATF1-chromatin complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Semiquantitative PCR was performed in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and the following PCR primers specific to the ferritin H ARE or another sequence in the ferritin H gene that does not contain the ARE: ferritin ARE primers: 5′-CCCTCCAGGTCTTATGACTGCTC-3′ and 5′-GTTTCTGGAGGTTCAGCACGTC-3′; ferritin non-ARE primers: 5′-ACATAGTACTTCATTAAACATACAAAT-3′ and 5′-TCTTCTGAGGCTGTCAGAAGC-3′. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—In ATF1 siRNA experiments, two different transfection methods (electroporation and Lipofectamine 2000) were used in 293 cells. For electroporation, final 20, 100, or 500 nm of siATF1 (J-01004508, sense 5′-GAUCCGAACUACACCUUCAUU-3′, and antisense 5′-UGAAGGUGUAGUUCGGAUCUU-3′; Dharmacon) or nontargeting siControl (D-001210-01, sense 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAAUU-3′, antisense 5-UUGAUGUGUUUAGUCGCUAUU-3′; Dharmacon) RNA were transfected into 1 × 107 293 cells using Gene Pulser X-Cell (Bio-Rad preoptimized setting for 293 cells) in medium without FBS or antibiotics. After incubation of cells in the cuvette for 5–10 min at room temperature, the cells were suspended in 10 ml of FBS/antibiotic-free OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and incubated for 48 h in a 100-mm dish. For Lipofectamine-mediated transfection, 40, 200, and 400 pmol of siATF1 or siControl RNA (final 40, 200, and 400 nm) was mixed with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of FBS/antibiotic-free OptiMEM. The resulting RNA-lipid complexes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 2 ml of growth medium (1 × 105 293 cells/well in 6-well plate) was aspirated, and 500 μl of OptiMEM (FBS/antibiotic-free) and 500 μl of the Lipofectamine 2000-siRNA mixture was added to 293 cells and incubated for 48 h. To detect expression of ATF1, ferritin H, and β-actin, 50 μg of whole cell lysates was subjected to Western blotting with anti-ATF1 (sc-243; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ferritin H (sc-25617; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-β-actin (A5441; Sigma) antibodies. Total RNA was also isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 10 μg of RNA was subjected to Northern blotting with 32P-labeled human ferritin H cDNA probe. In PIAS3 siRNA experiments, 100 pmol of two different siRNAs (final concentration, 1 μm) for human PIAS3 (M-004164-05, sense 5′-GGAGCCAAAUGUGAUUAUAUU-3′, and antisense 5′-UAUAAUCACAUUUGGCUCCUU-3′; J-004164-12, sense 5′-GACAGAGAGUCAGCACUAUUU-3′, and antisense 5′-AUAGUGCUGACUCUCUGUCUU-3′; Dharmacon) or siControl RNA (D-001210-01; Dharmacon) was transfected into 1 × 107 K562 cells by electroporation using Gene Pulser X-Cell (Bio-Rad, a preoptimized setting for K562) without FBS or antibiotics. 4 h after transfection, FBS was added to a final 20%, and the cells were incubated for 40 h. The cells were then treated with 50 μm t-BHQ or hemin for 8 h and harvested. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting to detect PIAS3, ferritin H, and β-actin expression levels using anti-PIAS3 (AP1245a; Abgent), anti-ferritin H (sc-25617) and anti-β-actin (A5441; Sigma) antibodies. Total RNA was also isolated, and 10 μg of RNA was subjected to Northern blotting for hybridization with 32P-labeled human ferritin H cDNA probe. ATF1 Binds to the Ferritin H ARE and Represses Its Transcription—To investigate the role of ATF1 in the regulation of the ferritin H ARE, we first performed ChIP assay for ATF1 binding to the ferritin H ARE in the cells. Transfection of HA-ATF1 into K562 cells, followed by ChIP assay, revealed that transfected HA-ATF1 binds to the ARE of the ferritin H gene in the cells (Fig. 1A). We also detected endogenous ATF1 binding to the ferritin H ARE in K562 cells in ChIP assay using ATF1 antibodies (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that ATF1 is a binding protein of the ferritin H ARE. We then asked whether ATF1 regulates ferritin H transcription through the ARE. Varied amounts of ATF1 expression plasmid were transfected into K562 cells along with the –4.5-kb human ferritin H luciferase reporter that contains the ARE sequences or the –4.4-kb human ferritin H luciferase reporter that lacks the ARE, and luciferase assays were performed. Unexpectedly, ATF1 repressed expression of the ferritin H luciferase containing the ARE (–4.5-kb ARE (+)), whereas the luciferase construct lacking the ARE (–4.4-kb ARE (-)) showed decreased basal expression and no response to ATF1 (Fig. 2A). To confirm this observation, and to assess the function of endogenous ATF1 on ferritin H expression, we performed knockdown of ATF1 by transfection of siATF1 RNA and examined ferritin H expression by Northern and Western blots. We also attempted treatment with either tert-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) or hemin, both of which induced the transcription of the human ferritin H gene through the ARE (17Tsuji Y. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7567-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 56Iwasaki K. Mackenzie E.L. Hailemariam K. Sakamoto K. Tsuji Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 (B and C), ATF1 knockdown increased endogenous ferritin H protein and mRNA expression, both at the steady state and the t-BHQ or hemin-mediated induced levels, suggesting that endogenous ATF1 is a repressor of the ferritin H gene. From these collective results, we concluded that ATF1 is a transcriptional repressor of the human ferritin H gene through the ARE. PIAS3 Is an ATF1-binding Protein and Reverses ATF1-mediated Transcriptional Repression of the Ferritin H Gene through the ARE—To investigate ATF1-mediated regulation of the ferritin H ARE, we employed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify ATF1-binding proteins that may regulate ATF1 activity through a protein-protein interaction. We screened a NIH3T3 mouse cDNA library using a full-length human ATF1 as bait and identified a cDNA encoding C-terminal 212 amino acids (amino acids 418–630) of PIAS3 (Fig. 3A). Because PIAS3 is highly conserved in its amino acid sequences between mouse and human (97%) including the C-terminal region isolated from our two-hybrid screening, we investigated the role of human PIAS3 in the regulation of human ATF1 transcription factor throughout the rest of this study. First, we confirmed the interaction between PIAS3 and ATF1 in mammalian cells by coimmunoprecipitation assays. Full-length FLAG-PIAS3 and HA-ATF1 expression plasmids were cotransfected into 293 cells. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody and Western blotting with anti-HA antibody. Under the condition of equal expression levels of HA-ATF1 and FLAG-PIAS3 (Fig. 3B, middle and bottom panels), HA-ATF1 was coprecipitated only when FLAG-PIAS3 was expressed in the cells, although an unidentified nonspecific band with a slightly larger size than the HA-ATF1 band was also detected in all three lanes (Fig. 3B, top panel). Then we examined the endogenous PIAS3 and ATF1 interaction by immunoprecipitation with anti-PIAS3 antibody followed by Western blotting with the anti-ATF1 family antibody (cross-reactive to CREB and cAMP-response element modulator). As shown in Fig. 3C, PIAS3 antibody coimmunoprecipitated endogenous ATF1 as well as CREB, whereas control IgG failed to precipitate these proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that human PIAS3 is an ATF1-binding protein. To investigate role of PIAS3 on ATF1 function and ferritin H transcription, we cotransfected –4.4-kb ARE(-)- or –4.5-kb ARE(+)-ferritin H-luciferase reporter along with PIAS3 into K562 cells to test whether PIAS3 activates or inhibits the ferritin H ARE. As shown in Fig. 4A, PIAS3 specifically activated –4.5-kb ARE(+) reporter expression. Next, we asked whether PIAS3 modulates the repressive effect of ATF1 on the ferritin H ARE. Transfection of –4.5-kb ARE(+)-ferritin H-luciferase reporter together with ATF1 and varied amounts of PIAS3 into K562 cells showed that ATF1 reproducibly repressed ferritin H ARE-luciferase and that the ATF1-mediated ARE repression was reversed by increased amounts of PIAS3 (Fig. 4B). This reversal effect was not due to decreased expression of ATF1 after cotransfection with PIAS3 (Fig. 4B, bottom panel). We obtained similar results in 293 cells, showing that the reversal effect of ATF1 repression by PIAS3 was dependent on the prese"

G proteins regulate apoptosis in addition to other cellular functions, but the roles of specific G proteins in apoptosis signaling are not well characterized. Gα12 stimulates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine phosphatase that modulates essential signaling pathways, including apoptosis. Herein, we examined whether Gα12 regulates apoptosis in epithelial cells. Inducible expression of Gα12 or constitutively active (QL)α12 in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells led to increased apoptosis with expression of QLα12, but not Gα12. Inducing QLα12 led to degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 (via the proteasome pathway), increased JNK activity, and up-regulated IκBα protein levels, a potent stimulator of apoptosis. Furthermore, the QLα12-stimulated activation of JNK was blocked by inhibiting PP2A. To characterize endogenous Gα12 signaling pathways, non-transfected MDCK-II and HEK293 cells were stimulated with thrombin. Thrombin activated endogenous Gα12 (confirmed by GST-tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) pull-downs) and stimulated apoptosis in both cell types. The mechanisms of thrombin-stimulated apoptosis through endogenous Gα12 were nearly identical to the mechanisms identified in QLα12-MDCK cells and included loss of Bcl-2, JNK activation, and up-regulation of IκBα. Knockdown of the PP2A catalytic subunit in HEK293 cells inhibited thrombin-stimulated apoptosis, prevented JNK activation, and blocked Bcl-2 degradation. In summary, Gα12 has a major role in regulating epithelial cell apoptosis through PP2A and JNK activation leading to loss of Bcl-2 protein expression. Targeting these pathways in vivo may lead to new therapeutic strategies for a variety of disease processes.

Changes in apoptosis signaling pathways contribute to major disease processes including cancer, degenerative neurological diseases, such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimer, and kidney failure from numerous etiologies including polycystic kidney disease. There are two major signaling pathways leading to apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway is mediated by the permeabilization of mitochondria and caspase-9 activation and is a general response to cell damage or stress. The extrinsic pathway is activated by stimulation from specific death inducing factors, such as Fas (apoptosis-stimulating fragment) and tumor necrosis factor and is mediated by caspase-8 (1Zimmermann K.C.

In the intrinsic pathway, the Bcl family (including pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins) is central to determining whether cells will undergo apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Sorenson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is localized in the outer mitochondrial, endoplasmic reticulum, and perinuclear membranes, and under proliferative and anti-apoptotic (pro-survival) conditions, Bcl-2 heterodimerizes with pro-apoptotic protein BAX to form a stable, non-conductive complex (2Sorenson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). With an apoptotic stimulus, Bcl-2 is phosphorylated; this prevents dimerization with Bax and also leads to Bcl-2 degradation, thus permitting BAX to homodimerize and catalyze the formation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel. This channel allows the efflux of cytochrome c, triggering Apaf-1 and the caspase cascade leading to apoptosis (2Sorenson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 3Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar).Heterotrimeric G proteins regulate numerous cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, junctional assembly, and apoptosis. G proteins consist of Gα and Gβγ subunits, and form a stable heterotrimeric complex with GDP bound to the α subunit in the resting state. In canonical G protein signaling, ligand binding to a seven-transmembrane domain receptor results in conformational changes in Gα that lead to dissociation of GDP and separation from Gβγ. GTP subsequently binds to Gα, and signal transduction occurs through Gα and Gβγ subunits until the intrinsic Gα GTPase activity hydrolyzes GTP to GDP. It is now appreciated that G protein signaling is quite complex with the identification of G proteins in subcellular microdomains and in interactions with numerous regulatory and scaffolding proteins. Several studies have implicated signaling through each of the four heterotrimeric G protein families (Gαs, Gαi/o, Gαq/11, and Gα12/13) to regulate apoptosis, but the mechanism(s) are not well defined (4Al-Rasheed N.M.

In transiently transfected COS cells, Gα12 and Gα13 induced apoptosis through activation of MEKK1 and Ask1 in a Bcl-2-dependent manner (18Berestetskaya Y.V. Faure M.P. Ichijo H.

However, there is very little known about the role of Gα12 in regulating apoptosis in non-transfected cells, and few studies have investigated G protein regulation of apoptosis in epithelial cells. Recently, we identified an interaction of Gα12 with the regulatory subunit of the serine/threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and demonstrated that Gα12 stimulated PP2A activity in vitro and in MDCK cells (20Zhu D. Kosik K.S. Meigs T.E. Yanamadala V. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54983-54986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Zhu D. Tate R.I. Ruediger R. Meigs T.E. Denker B.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 1268-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PP2A is implicated in many of the same cellular processes that have been described for Gα12 (reviewed in Ref. 22Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar). PP2A regulates apoptosis by maintaining dephosphorylated Bcl-2 (23Lin S.S. Bassik M.C. Suh H. Nishino M. Arroyo J.D. Hahn W.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23003-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as well as regulating several other members of the Bcl-2 family. Identification of the Gα12-PP2A interaction prompted us to investigate whether these signaling proteins were linked to apoptosis in epithelial cells. Using a well characterized MDCK cell culture model of inducible expression of Gα12, we report that Gα12 is a potent activator of apoptosis in epithelial cells and identify critical regulation of Bcl-2 protein levels by Gα12, PP2A, and JNK. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that activation of endogenous Gα12-coupled signaling pathways stimulates apoptosis in epithelial cells and recapitulates the signaling pathways identified in the inducible Gα12-MDCK cell model.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Gα12, anti-JNK1, anti-ERK, anti-NF-κB, anti-IκBα, and goat anti-PP2A catalytic subunit were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-pThr183/pTyr185-JNK, anti-pThr202/pTyr204-ERK, and anti-Bcl-xL were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA), mouse anti-Bcl-2 was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA), and rabbit anti-phospho-cJun was from Biovision (Mountain View, CA).

Plasticware and culture slides were from BD Falcon (Lincoln Park, NJ).Cell Culture—Establishment, characterization, and culture conditions for Tet-Off MDCK-II cell lines (Clontech) with inducible wild type Gα12 and constitutively activated QLα12 expression were previously described (13Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24855-24858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 5% Tet system-approved fetal bovine serum (Clontech), 100 μg/ml G418 (Cellgro), 50 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science), and 40 ng/ml doxycycline (dox) (Sigma). Non-transfected Tet-Off MDCK-II cell lines were maintained in the same culture medium without hygromycin. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) 293 cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.Flow Cytometry—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were grown to confluence and cultured ± dox for 72 h. Adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and pooled with floating cells (1-2 × 106) by low speed centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 70% ethanol in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml RNase A in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, after which cells were stained in 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Invitrogen) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry in the propidium iodide/PE Texas Red channel. 10,000 cells were analyzed per experiment.DNA Fragmentation Assay—Gα12- or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h. Adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and pooled with floating cells by low speed centrifugation, washed with PBS, and lysed with genomic DNA extraction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K). Extracts were incubated for 24 h at 50 °C and subsequently for 1 h at 37 °C with 1 μg/ml RNase A (MP Biomedical, Solon, OH). DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform (1:1) and precipitated at -70 °C for 24 h with 3 volume equivalents of absolute ethanol. DNA pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 1 mm EDTA buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 0.5% agarose gel run at 50 V for 4 h. Images were obtained using a Kodak DC290 Zoom Digital Camera (Eastman Kodak).Caspase 9 Activity—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h. Cells were lysed and assessed for caspase-9 activation using LEHD-pNA as a substrate, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Caspase 9 Colorimetric Assay Kit, Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA).Cell Proliferation Assay—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h in a 96-well plate. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the tetrazolium salt 4-[3-(4-idophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (Biovision, Mountain View, CA) in Electrocoupling Solution (Biovision) substrate for 2 h. The plate was read at 450 nm to quantify formazan produced, which correlates directly to mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity.Kinexus Kinetworks™ Phospho-site Phosphorylation Screen—1 × 107 QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were grown to confluence, cultured ± dox for 72 h. To obtain whole cell lysates, monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped in lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteases inhibitors (Roche)), sonicated gently, and subjected to low speed centrifugation. Supernatants were collected and normalized for protein concentration. 750 μl of 1 mg/ml was analyzed for phosphorylation of target proteins (Kinexus Bioinformatics Corp., Vancouver, B.C., Canada).c-Jun N-terminal Kinase Activity—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h. Floating cells and adherent cells were collected by trypsinization for 5 min and low speed centrifugation, washed with PBS, and lysed with JNK Extraction Buffer (Biovision). Lysates were normalized for protein concentration and analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (KinaseSTAR JNK Activity Screening Kit, Biovision). Briefly, lysates were incubated with GST-cJun on glutathione-Sepharose beads to pull down total JNK, which was resuspended with 200 μm ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Samples were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot for phospho-cJun.RNA Isolation and Semiquantitiative RT-PCR Analysis—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h and lysed with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was purified according to the manufacturer’s protocol and quantified. 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Roche). Equal aliquots of cDNA (5 μl) were subsequently amplified for Bcl-2 and β-actin. The oligonucleotide primer sequences used for Bcl-2 and β-actin (Operon, Huntsville, AL) were as follows: Bcl-2: sense, 5′-ATGGCGCACGCTGGGC-3′; antisense, 5′-TCACTTATGGCCCAGATAGGCAC-3′; β-actin: sense, 5′-ATGGACGATGAAATTGCGGCG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGATGGACG-3′. After 35 cycles, the amplified fragments were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining using a Kodak DC290 Zoom Digital Camera (Kodak).Immunoblot Analysis—Gα12-or QLα12-expressing MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h. Lysates were prepared as described above and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with the following primary antibodies: Gα12 (1:1000), Bcl-2 (1:500), JNK1 (1:500), pThr183/pTyr185-JNK (1:500), ERK1 (1:500), Bcl-xL (1:500), IκBα (1:500), NF-κB (1:500), or β-actin (1:10,000). After washing and incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature, signal was detected with SuperSignal West Pico horseradish peroxidase substrate system (Pierce) and autoradiography (Biomax MR, Kodak).GST-TPR Pull Down Assay—The GST-TPR construct was kindly provided by Dr. M. Negishi, Kyoto University, Kyoto Japan. GST-TPR and GST were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from bacterial lysates as described previously (24Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in Lysis Buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and proteases inhibitors (Roche)) and normalized for protein concentration. 1 μg of GST or GST-TPR coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 800 μg of total protein and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted with low speed centrifugation and washed three times with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.siRNA Knockdowns—PP2A catalytic subunit was selectively knocked down using SMARTpool pooled siRNAs (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) that contains four different siRNAs (catalog number D-001206-13-01). A nonspecific control pool (catalog number D-001206-13-01) was used for the negative control and also contained four different siRNAs. HEK293 cells were transfected with siRNA (200 nm) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. After overnight incubation, fresh media was added to the cells, and the cells were cultured an additional 24 h. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot with goat anti-PP2A catalytic subunit antibody at 1:2000. For thrombin stimulation, cells were serum starved overnight prior to treatment with 2 units/ml. JNK phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression were examined by Western blot at 8 h, and apoptosis was quantified after 24 h.Quantification and Statistics—Western blots and agarose gels were scanned using an Epson 1640 desktop scanner and band intensity quantified using NIH Image (Wayne Rasband) after subtracting background and determining linear range. Statistics were done in GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Significance was determined by using the two-tailed t test.RESULTSExpression of QLα12 in MDCK-II Cells Induces Apoptosis—Several factors including the disruption of cell-matrix interactions and dome formation associated with confluence have been shown to trigger apoptosis in MDCK cells (25Chang Y.H. Lin H.H. Wang Y.K. Chiu W.T. Su H.W. Tang M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 26Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). The pathways associated with these phenotypes are not known. The study of Gα12 has been limited by low levels of expression in cells, and by its novel protein characteristics that make it difficult to express in vitro and in cell culture models. We have established and extensively characterized the inducible expression of wild type Gα12 and constitutively active QLα12 using the Tet-off MDCK cell culture model (12Meyer T.N. Hunt J. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-C1293): C1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24855-24858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The removal of dox for 72 h induces Gα12 expression (Fig. 1A), and the re-addition of dox suppresses Gα12 protein expression to background levels within 48 h (not shown, but in Refs. 12Meyer T.N. Hunt J. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-C1293): C1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar and 13Meyer T.N. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24855-24858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that expression of QLα12, but not wild type Gα12 leads to disruption of junctional complexes and inhibits dome formation (12Meyer T.N. Hunt J. Schwesinger C. Denker B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285 (-C1293): C1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether Gα12 regulated apoptosis in MDCK cells, Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells were cultured ± dox for 72 h, followed by overnight serum starvation. Apoptosis was determined by propidium iodide flow cytometry (Fig. 1B), DNA laddering (Fig. 1, C and D), and caspase 9 activity (Fig. 1E). In all assays, QLα12-MDCK (-dox) cells showed a marked increase in apoptosis compared with the other conditions. In flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1B), there was a 4-5-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells with QLα12 expression when compared with +dox and with Gα12-MDCK cells ± dox. Moreover, there was a parallel reduction in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 and mitosis phases of the cell cycle. Fig. 1C shows the DNA laddering in Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells ± dox. Total intact genomic DNA was reduced to less than 50% in the QLα12 expressing cells (-dox) (quantified in Fig. 1D), whereas there was little effect in Gα12-MDCK cells ± dox. However, compared with Gα12-MDCK cells, there was a small reduction in genomic DNA of QLα12-MDCK cells in +dox conditions (about 10-15%). This may reflect incomplete suppression of the tetracycline responsive element leading to a small amount of QLα12 expression (although QLα12 protein is not detectable by Western in +dox, Fig. 1A). Finally, to confirm the increase in apoptosis and to determine the role of the intrinsic pathway, we assessed the activity of caspase 9. Consistent with the flow cytometry results and DNA laddering, there was a marked increase in caspase 9 activity in the QLα12 expressing cells that was not seen in other conditions (Fig. 1E). This suggests that QLα12 activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and this is distinct from apoptosis induced by dome formation and confluence, which is associated with distal activation of caspase 8 but not caspase 9 (25Chang Y.H. Lin H.H. Wang Y.K. Chiu W.T. Su H.W. Tang M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 211: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).The Effect of Gα12 Expression on Proliferation—The results from flow cytometry (Fig. 1B) revealed little change in the fraction of cells in the synthesis stage suggesting that proliferation may not be increased under these conditions. To address the effects of Gα12 on proliferation in the inducible MDCK cell model, proliferation was quantified by measuring mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1F), a well established correlate of cell proliferation (27Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45551) Google Scholar). Proliferation was measured in confluent and subconfluent monolayers. When Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells were plated at confluence (identical to conditions for apoptosis assays) and switched to ±dox for 72 h, there were no significant differences in proliferation (Fig. 1F). However, when Gα12-MDCK cells were plated at subconfluent density (∼50%) and switched into ±dox after plating, there was increased proliferation in Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells (-dox) at 72 h (Fig. 1G). Fig. 1G also shows that at 24 and 48 h proliferation rates were minimally stimulated in Gα12- and Qα12-MDCK cells (±dox) compared with Tet-off control cells. These results indicate that Gα12 stimulates proliferation in MDCK cells when cultured under specific conditions.QLα12 Expression Results in Reduced Bcl-2 Expression—We next examined the effects of Gα12 expression on the protein levels of the two major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Fig. 2 (A and B) shows that inducing QLα12 (-dox) leads to nearly complete loss of Bcl-2 protein, in comparison with +dox and with Gα12-MDCK cells (±dox). In contrast, there was no appreciable difference in the levels of Bcl-xL protein for any of the conditions (Fig. 2A). The absence of any effect of Gα12 expression on Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein levels is consistent with the lack of an effect in Gα12-MDCK cells on apoptosis. To establish whether the QLα12-stimulated loss of Bcl-2 was mediated by changes in gene expression, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed for each condition. Fig. 2 (C and D) reveals no significant differences in Bcl-2 transcript in the QLα12-MDCK cells in -dox when compared with the other conditions.FIGURE 2Expression of Bcl-2 is significantly reduced in QLα12 cells.A, expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in Gα12-MDCK cells. Western blots Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were performed on lysates from Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells cultured in ±dox for 72 h. The blot was stripped and reprobed for β-actin. B, Western blots were quantified for Bcl-2 expression after normalization to the β-actin using NIH Image. Results are the mean ± S.E. of 10 independent experiments. C, reverse transcriptase-PCR for Bcl-2 was performed from Gα12- and QLα12-MDCK cells cultured in ±dox for 72 h. RT-PCR for β-actin was used as a loading control.

QLα12 expression (-dox) specifically increased the phosphorylation of JNK1 and completely inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1, without significantly affecting other MAPK family members, JNK2, ERK2, or p38 (Fig. 3A). To confirm the increased JNK1 activity detected in the phosphoprotein screen, JNK1 activity was determined by phospho-JNK1 Western blot (Fig. 3, B and C) and by direct measurement of JNK activity (Fig. 3, D and E). Fig. 3 shows that inducing QLα12 protein expression (-dox) led to a nearly 15-fold induction of JNK1 activity as determined by p-JNK1 immunoreactivity, a value similar to the effect seen in the phosphoprotein screen. QLα12 expression did not significantly affect total JNK1 levels. Additionally, Fig."

The IL-21 cytokine has been demonstrated to possess potent stimulatory effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of several classes of hematopoietic cells, including B-cells, T-cells, and NK-cells. The biological effects of IL-21 are mediated via activation of the IL-21 receptor complex, which is composed of an IL-21 private receptor chain (IL-21Rα) in complex with the common γ chain (γc), which similarly constitutes an essential component of the signaling receptor complex of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. These cytokines thus constitute a subfamily referred to as common γ chain cytokines, with IL-21 being the most recently added member (2Parrish-Novak J. Foster D.C. Holly R.D. Clegg C.H. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 856-863PubMed Google Scholar). Within the common γ chain family of cytokines, high resolution structural information has been obtained through x-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy for IL-2 and IL-4 (3Brandhuber B.J. Boone T.

It is apparent from these studies that IL-2 and IL-4 along with other type 1 cytokines, including IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, share a common overall topology in their structures despite a distant homology in sequence (9Hill E.E. Morea V. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 205-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The common structural motif of these proteins consists of a central four-helical bundle, arranged in an up-up-down-down topology, connected by loops that are characterized by a high degree of structural freedom, a considerable difference in loop length, and variation in the number and positioning of stabilizing disulfide bridges. Crystal structures have also been reported for IL-2 and IL-4 in complex with the corresponding private chains and, in the case of IL-2, the common γ chain (10Wang X.Q. Rickert M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2005; 310: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 11Hage T. Sebald W. Reinemer P.

Science. 2005; 308: 1477-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). IL-2 is distinct from both IL-4 and IL-21 by having two private receptor chains, IL-2Rα and IL-2Rβ, where IL-2Rβ is homologous to IL-4Rα and IL-21Rα. Only minor structural differences are observed between the free and receptor-bound forms of IL-2 and IL-4, indicating that only slight structural changes occur for these cytokines upon complex formation. These studies accurately identify the residues of the cytokines involved in receptor binding and closely mirror earlier results obtained from mutagenesis studies (13Kruse N. Shen B.J. Arnold S. Tony H.P. Muller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Tony H.P. Shen B.J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To further understand structure-function relationships within the common γ chain family of cytokines and their receptors, we here report studies of hIL-21 by NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis. Although the structure resolved for the fully folded form of hIL-21 bears a strong resemblance to the structures previously reported for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-2 and IL-4, we have identified some highly distinct features of the hIL-21 molecule. NMR exchange and variable temperature studies of hIL-21 reveal the presence of two distinct yet interchangeable states for a segment extending from Ser57 to Gly84. This segment includes and extends beyond helix C in both directions. Chemical shift values and 15N relaxation data show that the Ser57-Gly84 segment is fully folded in one conformer while partially unfolded and missing helix C in the other conformer. In both forms, part of the long CD loop, flanking helix C, is unstructured. A model of the hIL-21 receptor complex suggests the involvement of the structurally heterogenic helix C of hIL-21 in the interaction with IL-21Rα. Since a segment of hIL-21, which is believed to be critical for receptor binding, exists in alternate conformations, these subpopulations are expected to differ in their inherent binding affinity to the receptor interface. Thus, we undertook the construction of an hIL-21 variant, in which the segment surrounding the unstable helix C region had been substituted with the corresponding yet more stable sequence of hIL-4. This analysis led to the identification of a novel hIL-21 variant that possesses a 10-fold increase in potency with respect to hIL-21 receptor activation. The improved potency of this chimeric variant is rationalized to arise as a result of having engineered a higher degree of local stabilization, thus preorganizing hIL-21 for receptor binding, specifically in a domain that is critical for receptor binding. Protein Expression and Purification—Met-hIL-21 consists of the sequence of the mature human IL-21 protein as determined by recombinant expression in mammalian cell culture but including an extra methionine residue added recombinantly at the N terminus. 3C. Herling, personal communication. The protein is numbered starting with Gln30 as residue 1. The N-terminal methionine residue that is present when the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli thus becomes residue Met0. The cDNA corresponding to the Met-hIL-21 coding sequence was cloned in the pET11c expression vector, transformed into the E. coli BL21 DE3 strain, and induced during exponential growth with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h prior to harvest. Multiple and comparable preparations of the Met-hIL-21 protein were prepared, purified from inclusion bodies, and tested for activity. In the following, Met-hIL-21 expressed in E. coli will be denoted hIL-21. For NMR analysis, the protein was expressed in E. coli growing in a minimal medium with 15NH4SO4 and/or [13C6]glucose as the main source for nitrogen and carbon. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 m guanidinium HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 40 mm dithiothreitol at pH 8.0 and refolded by dilution into a refolding buffer containing 0.75 m l-arginine, 40 mm Tris-HCl, 0.005% polyethylene glycol 3350, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm cystine, 20 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.5 and left overnight at 15 °C with slow stirring. Refolding was stopped by adjusting pH to 5.5 with acetic acid followed by 4-fold dilution into 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. Misfolded hIL-21 was allowed to precipitate and removed by filtration. Refolded hIL-21 was captured on a TosoHaas SP550C column and eluted with 1 m NaCl at pH 8.5 using a step gradient. Fractions with hIL-21 were pooled and diluted 10-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, before being loaded onto a Sepharose SP column. hIL-21 was eluted using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 5.5. Fractions with hIL-21 were pooled and concentrated with a Centriprep centrifugal filter from Millipore (cut-off 10 kDa). The concentrated hIL-21 was loaded onto a Superdex75 gel filtration column equilibrated in 20 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. All chromatographic steps were run at 4 °C. Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled NMR samples (0.2-2.0 mm) were prepared in 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm phosphate, 1 mm NaN3 at pH 5.5 (90% H2O, 10% D2O) using Amicon Ultra-4 (cut-off 10 kDa). Sample homogeneity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and was for all samples >95%. NMR Experiments—Unless otherwise specified, NMR spectra were acquired at 27 °C on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H{15N,13C} TXI probe. One-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired for hIL-21 samples with concentrations in the range 0.2-2.0 mm. Sequential backbone assignments were done using established methods (15Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11655-11666Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 16Hyberts S.G. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Assignment of side chain resonances included the use of HN(CO)HAHB, H(C)(CCCO)NH, (H)C(CCCO)NH, H(C)CH-TOCSY, and (H)CCH-TOCSY spectra as well as 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra. The 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 3-mm triple resonance probe and on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H{15N,13C} TXI cryoprobe, respectively. Temperature studies were performed by acquiring 15N HSQC spectra at temperatures between 10 and 50 °C. Control spectra at 27 °C were acquired before and after the experiments. 15N HSQC type exchange experiments were acquired with mixing times ranging from 0 to 1000 ms (17Farrow N.A. Zhang O.W. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Experiments measuring backbone amide 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOEs were acquired on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm 1H{15N,13C} TXI cryoprobe (18Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). T1 and T2 values were determined by least-square fitting of signal intensities to an exponential curve. Heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOEs were calculated as the intensity ratios between 15N HSQC spectra recorded with and without proton saturation. Cells and Cell Culture—The Baf3/hIL-21Rα cells, which were employed for the activity analysis, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, including 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5% penicillin/streptomycin, 1 ng/ml murine IL-3, 200 mg/ml zeocin, and 1 mg/ml neomycin. The cells that have been transfected to stably express hIL-21Rα also harbor an expression reporter cassette in which the luciferase gene is linked to a STAT-inducible promotor element. The Baf3 cell, being a murine pre-B-cell line, expresses endogenously the murine γc, which has been demonstrated to be functionally active when engaged in a complex with the human hIL-21Rα receptor chain. Construction of IL-21 cDNA Variant—The expression construct encoding the hIL-21 variant, Chim-hIL-21/4, was generated through site-directed mutagenesis of the wild type hIL-21 cDNA. Mutations were introduced by PCR-directed mutagenesis using the overlap extension protocol and Pwo polymerase. The full open reading frame of the mutated hIL-21 cDNA was verified by sequencing. Activity Assays—The Baf3/hIL-21Rα cells were seeded (50,000 cells/well) in 96-well plates (Packard ViewPlate, catalog number 6005182) in 90 μl of medium and starved in IL-3-free medium for 6 h prior to stimulation. Protein was added to each well in increasing final concentrations, and the cells were stimulated by incubation for 24 h. To each well was added 100 μl of Luciferin reagent (PerkinElmer LucLite Luminescence Receptor Gene Assay System, catalog number 6016911), and after 30 min in the dark, samples were analyzed in a Packard Topcount microplate scintillation counter. Data were analyzed by Graph-Prism. Using this assay, hIL-21 expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells, respectively, has been analyzed in direct comparison. Met-hIL-21 expressed in E. coli and hIL-21 expressed in HEK293 cells have thus yielded potencies of 5.6 × 10-10 and 3.1 × 10-10 m, respectively (n = 3), and equivalent levels of maximum stimulation. Modeling of hIL-21·hILR-21α and Chim-hIL-21/4·hIL-21Rα Complexes—Structure alignments were performed with the program LSQMAN (19Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey T. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. 2006: 59-66Google Scholar), and the program Indonesia (20Madsen D. Johansson P. Johansson N. Arent S. Harris M.R. Kleywegt G.J. Indonesia: An Integrated Workbench for Sequence and Structure Alignment and Analysis. 2005; (, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden)Google Scholar) was used otherwise for sequence alignments and figures. Models were constructed with the program Modeler (21Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10565) Google Scholar) using the crystal structure of the hIL-4·hIL-4Rα complex and the NMR structure of hIL-21 as templates. A sequence alignment between the three homologous receptor chains hIL-2Rβ, hIL-4Rα, and hIL-21Rα was performed manually using the structural alignment of the binary hIL-2·hIL-2Rβ and hIL-4·hIL-4Rα complexes as a starting point. Constraints were introduced to guide hydrogen bonding between Asp75 of hIL-21Rα, and Arg76 of hIL-21 and Chim-hIL-21/4. Resolution of the hIL-21 Structure by NMR—The 15N HSQC spectra recorded for hIL-21 display a fairly good dispersion despite a number of signals at random coil chemical shift values. These latter signals are due to the presence of flexible regions in the hIL-21 molecule. Dilution experiments reveal no signs of aggregation in the range of 0.2-2.0 mm hIL-21. Only minor changes were observed in 15N HSQC spectra acquired at different pH values and salt concentrations (pH between 5.0 and 7.0 and NaCl between 0 and 100 mm). Backbone resonances were assigned on the basis of a standard set of three-dimensional experiments (15Yamazaki T. Lee W. Arrowsmith C.H. Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11655-11666Crossref Scopus (495) Google Scholar), which were acquired using a uniformly 15N/13C-labeled hIL-21 sample. More than 96% of backbone resonances (N, HN, CA, HA, and CO) were assigned. Surprisingly, for residues Ser57-Gly84, two distinct signals were observed for each residue, demonstrating the presence of two different species of hIL-21. Side chain resonance assignments are nearly complete (excluding the minor form at 27 °C of Ser57-Gly87), with only 23 nonlabile protons missing. A plot of the difference between the observed chemical shifts and the tabulated values for random coil chemical shifts for backbone CA atoms (22Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) against sequence number is shown in Fig. 1. Here four regions displaying positive secondary chemical shift reveal the presence and the position of the four α-helices (A-D) observed within the major form of hIL-21. Helices A (Met7-Asp26) and D (Pro104-Ser124) are significantly longer than the helices B (Trp44-Lys52) and C (Asn63-Lys73). In the minor form of hIL-21 at 27 °C, the segment Ser57-Gly84 shows no sign of helical structure (Fig. 1), suggesting that an extended, unordered conformation of this segment, which includes helix C sequence. A total of 1235, 2994, and 449 peaks from 15N-separated, 13C-separated and two-dimensional NOESY spectra, respectively, were included in structure calculations. Peaks from the unfolded form of helix C (see below) were not included in these calculations. Together with chemical shifts for the assigned resonances, the NOEs were analyzed with Cyana using the candid protocol for automatic NOE assignment and structure calculation (23Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Initial structure calculations were used to calibrate upper distance limits. Subsequently, all peak intensities were downscaled by a factor of 2 to correct for effects on peak intensities due to the presence of the unfolded form. Additional sources of structural information were included in the calculations. Thus, two disulfide bonds were enforced between Cys42 and Cys93 and between Cys49 and Cys96. This disulfide pattern has been established for the hIL-21 molecule through an analysis that combined protease cleavage, Edman degradation, and mass spectrometry. 4I. Fabrin and S. Bayne, personal communication. Test calculations without disulfide bond constraints supported this pattern (not shown). Chemical shift values for HA, CA, CB, N, and CO atoms were analyzed to predict ϕ and Ψ backbone angles using the computer program Talos (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Talos gave good predictions for 78 residues, and 156 angle ϕ/Ψ angle constraints were included in the calculations with an uncertainty of ±30°. From the HNHA spectrum, 72 J(HA-HN) scalar coupling constants were extracted and included in the structure calculations. Hydrogen bond constraints were added for 20 backbone amide protons, which exchange slowly in deuterium exchange experiments. Hydrogen bond patterns were established from structures calculated without hydrogen bond constraints. An ensemble of 20 structures was calculated with Cyana (Table 1). No distance violations greater than 0.5 Å were observed. In only four cases was a dihedral constraint violated by more than 5°. Segments of the protein at the N terminus (Met0-His6) and at the C terminus (Ser124-Ser133) are disordered, as is part of the loop connecting helices C and D (Pro79-Thr92). Except for these regions, the ensemble is well ordered, with a root mean square deviation of 0.64 Å for backbone heavy atoms (Fig. 2).TABLE 1Structural statistics for hIL-21ParameterValueConformationally restricting distance constraintsIntraresidue (i = j)209Sequential (i - j) = 1)502Medium range (2 ≤ (i - j) ≤ 5)496Long range (6 ≤ (i - j))548Total1755Dihedral angle constraints143Hydrogen bond constraints40Disulfide bond constraintsaEach disulfide bond is constrained by three upper and three lower bounds12Constraints per residue14.6Long range constraints per residue4.3Cyana target function (Å2)1.01 ± 0.10Average root mean square to mean coordinates (Å)Residues 7-123, backbone heavy atoms1.22Residues 7-123, heavy atoms1.76Residues 7-78, 93-123, backbone heavy atoms0.64Residues 7-78, 93-123, heavy atoms1.11Secondary structure elements, backbone heavy atoms0.47Secondary structure elements, heavy atoms1.02Ramachandran plot summary for residues 7-78, 93-123 (%)Most favored regions74Additionally allowed regions23Generously allowed regions2Disallowed regions1Distance constraint violations per Cyana conformer0.2-0.5 Å2.4>0.5 Å0Dihedral angle constraint violations per Cyana conformer>5°0.2a Each disulfide bond is constrained by three upper and three lower bounds Open table in a new tab hIL-21 Is a Four-helical Bundle with an Up-Up-Down-Down Topology—hIL-21 forms a four-helical bundle arranged in an up-up-down-down topology, which is shared by all members of the family of short-chain cytokines (Fig. 3). As a consequence of this topology, two long overhand loops connect helices A and B and helices C and D and wrap around the helix bundle on the face formed by helices B and D. Part of the two connecting loops forms a small β-sheet, a structural element that is generally conserved within the short-chain cytokines. A shorter loop connects the helices B and C, which themselves are remarkably short in comparison with other family members, being composed of 9 and 11 amino acids, respectively. A novel feature of hIL-21, which is not shared by other short-chain cytokines, is the presence of a β-sheet-like contact between the connecting loops AB and BC, where a hydrogen bond is formed between the carbonyl oxygen of Lys56 and the amide group of Val28. This β-sheet-like contact is possible due to the short B helix, which is followed by a segment (Ala53-Asn59) presented in an extended conformation and packing against the sequence, Leu27-Phe31, from the first part of the AB connecting loop. The long overhanging CD loop follows the short helix C. The N-terminal part of this loop, residues Lys75-Lys77, adopts an extended conformation, which is followed by 16 unstructured residues (Pro78-Cys93). Two Distinct Conformers of hIL-21 Exist in Equilibrium—During backbone assignment, two forms of hIL-21 were observed for residues within the segment Ser57-Gly84. The major form at 27 °C comprised helix C and the flanking loop regions, whereas the minor form showed no sign of helix formation. Presence of multiple signals for a resonance is due to either distinct chemical entities in the NMR samples or several conformers exchanging slowly on an NMR time scale. To further investigate the two sets of signals identified, NMR exchange spectra were recorded (17Farrow N.A. Zhang O.W. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). In these 15N HSQC type spectra, a mixing period is inserted between the two evolution times. If a conformational exchange takes place between two states of the protein during the mixing period, four peaks will appear for each exchanging amide group. Two of these peaks represent the normal 1H,15N correlation peaks for the two conformers. The two additional peaks are due to a conformational exchange occurring during the mixing period. Exchange peaks were observed for residues Ser57-Gly84, thus proving the existence of two distinct states of hIL-21, which exchange on a millisecond to second time scale (Fig. 4A). A temperature dependence of the relative peak intensities for signals attributable to the major and minor form of the Ser57 to Gly84 segment was observed in 15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 4B). Below 35 °C, the form in which helix C is present is the most abundant, whereas at higher temperatures the form lacking helix C predominates. Spectra acquired at 27 °C before and after the temperature experiments were very similar, thus demonstrating that the conformational changes taking place are reversible. The degree of internal motion in hIL-21 was probed on a microsecond to nanosecond time scale via backbone amide 15N T1 and T2 relaxation times and heteronuclear {1H}-15N NOEs (18Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Formankay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). For residues present within the four helices, the relaxation properties are fairly uniform, indicating a stable structure for the helix bundle of hIL-21. In contrast, the N-terminal residues, Met0-His6, as well as the C-terminal Ser125-Ser133 display increased 15N T2 values and decreased {1H}-15N NOE values (15N T1 values also decrease, but the effect is less pronounced), showing that the termini of the protein exhibit increased mobility. The three loops connecting the helices show a different dynamic behavior. The loop AB does not show increased dynamics relative to the helix bundle, thus indicating that this loop packs stably with the helix bundle. This is in agreement with the hIL-21 structure, in which part of the loop was observed to form β-sheets with both the BC and CD loops. The rest of the loop packs between the helix bundle and the CD loop. The short BC loop shows increased dynamics for residues Gly61 and Asn62, both located at the turn between helix B and C and exposed to water. Residues in the first part of loop CD, extending from Pro79 to Pro94, form the most mobile segment of hIL-21, when excluding the C- and N-terminal residues. This is in accordance with the highly disordered structure of the segment, which was indicated in the NMR structure by the lack of long range NOEs. The last part of the CD loop is, however, ordered like the helix bundle and also partakes in the β-sheet described for the AB loop. Moreover, the loop is connected to helix B via two disulfide bonds (Cys42-Cys93 and Cys49-Cys96). The pattern of mobility in the unfolded form of Ser57 to Gly84 mirrors that of the folded form just at a higher level. T2 values are mapped onto the NMR structure in Fig. 5B for the folded form and Fig. 5C for the unfolded form (the two plots are identical outside the Ser57-Gly84 region). It is evident that the partial unfolding involves the segment around and including helix C. The segment is flanked on the C-terminal side by the highly flexible part of the CD loop, which perhaps destabilizes helix C. A picture of a structurally unique region emerges for the segment of hIL-21 surrounding helix C. Together with the flanking loop residues (Ser57-Gly84), helix C thus exists in two distinct conformations present in equilibrium: a folded form, which predominates below 35 °C, and an unfolded and highly dynamic form, lacking helix C, which is dominant above 35 °C. This region overlaps with 16 unstructured residues (Pro78-Cys93) in the CD loop, which are devoid of secondary structural elements in both forms. Stabilization of Helix C and the CD Loop upon Receptor Binding?—The IL-21 receptor complex is composed of IL-21Rα and γc, the latter being shared by the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15. Recently, crystal structures of a binary hIL-4·hIL-4Rα complex (11Hage T. Sebald W. Reinemer P. Cell. 1999; 97: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and a quaternary hIL-2·hIL-2Rα·hIL-2β·γc complex (10Wang X.Q. Rickert M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2005; 310: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) have been resolved. In these complexes, the hIL-2β and the hIL-4Rα chains are homologous to IL-21Rα. In both complexes, the hIL-4·hIL-4Rα and hIL-2·hIL-2β receptor interfaces are assembled around residues positioned mainly within helices A and C, whereas the hIL-2·γc receptor interface is assembled around residues on helices A and D. The hIL-4·hIL-4Rα interface is formed around the two key positions Glu9 (helix A) and Arg88 (helix C) of hIL-4. Residue Glu9 docks into a pocket formed by Tyr13, Tyr127, and Tyr183 of hIL-4Rα, accepting hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl groups of Tyr13, Tyr127, and Ser70, whereas Arg88 forms an ion pair with Asp72 in hIL-4Rα (see Fig. 7A). Likewise, the hIL-2·hIL-2Rβ interface is assembled around Asp20 (helix A) and Asn88 (helix C) of hIL-2. Asp20 forms hydrogen bonds with His133 and Tyr134 in hIL-2Rβ, and Asn88 interacts with the Arg42 and Gln70 backbone carbonyls.

One promising approach for the treatment of such diseases is based on the administration of a wild-type enzyme to substitute the activity of the impaired enzyme by the use of enzyme replacement therapy, yet it is important to deliver this enzyme to the specific deficient tissue. We suggest a new concept for the treatment of metabolic diseases using fusion proteins. We examined the feasibility of this concept in the well characterized metabolic disease, phenylketonuria (PKU), which results from a mutation in the liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PAH is a key enzyme in the metabolic pathway of phenylalanine. Deficiency in PAH leads to high and persistent levels of this amino acid in the plasma of PKU patients, causing permanent neurological damage. Currently a low protein diet is still considered the only effective treatment for most PKU patients. To restore PAH activity in the liver of PKU patients, we constructed PAH-based fusion proteins with delivery moieties based on the HIV-transactivator of transcription peptide, and fragments of human hepatocyte growth factor aiming to specifically target PAH to the liver. We show that these new fusion proteins can be delivered into a variety of human liver cell lines and retain PAH activity after being internalized. We also show that plasma phenylalanine levels were dramatically lowered in mice treated with PAH-based fusion proteins after intravenous administration. We therefore suggest an alternative concept for the treatment of PKU using targeted fusion proteins, which may also be applied to the treatment of other metabolic diseases.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) 2The abbreviations used are: PKU, phenylketonuria; PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; TAT, HIV transactivator of transcription; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; NK1–3, N′ terminus and first, second, and third kringle domains, respectively, of HGF; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; cMet, Met oncogene; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography. 2The abbreviations used are: PKU, phenylketonuria; PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; TAT, HIV transactivator of transcription; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; NK1–3, N′ terminus and first, second, and third kringle domains, respectively, of HGF; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; cMet, Met oncogene; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography. is a metabolic disorder resulting from an abnormal form of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, EC 1.14.16.1). PAH catalyzes the irreversible hydroxylation of the amino acid phenylalanine to tyrosine in the liver. This step is considered the rate-limiting step in the catabolic pathway of Phe (1Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3160-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Up until now, more than 500 mutations have been found in the PAH gene, most of them leading to a dysfunctional enzyme. The disease is inherited in a classic recessive way, with an incidence of 1 out of 10,000 new-borns (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) 261600). PAH is a liver-specific enzyme with a crucial role in the maintenance of a low and steady level of Phe in the plasma. Untreated PKU patients suffer serious neurological damage due to sustained high Phe levels in the blood. Children diagnosed with PKU are immediately transferred to a low protein diet for life, to lower Phe levels in their plasma and maintain this normal level (2Scriver C.R. Clin Biochem. 1995; 28: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).New approaches for treatment have been suggested in recent years, including gene therapy (3Ding Z. Georgiev P. Thony B. Gene Ther. 2006; 13: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Chen L. Woo S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15581-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and enzyme replacement therapy using the yeast-derived enzyme PAL, which converts Phe into a harmless metabolite (5Sarkissian C.N. Shao Z. Blain F. Peevers R. Su H. Heft R. Chang T.M. Scriver C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2339-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These new ideas are considered promising, but still remain outside clinical practice, leaving reliance on the low protein diet as the only treatment used today for PKU.In this report we present a novel approach for the treatment of PKU. This approach is based on directing the PAH enzyme to the liver using either a common peptide or a selective homing ligand, both aimed at delivering the enzyme to the liver and its fast clearance from the blood.Recently new mechanisms for protein delivery have been suggested. One new promising approach is fusion with small peptides called protein transduction domains. These small peptides have been found to facilitate the penetration of fused proteins through the membranes of a large variety of eukaryotic cells. Though the mechanism of action involved in this internalization process is not clearly understood, involving neither receptor and clatherin-mediated endocytosis nor phagocytosis, these new protein transduction domains are considered promising delivery tools. Out of many protein transduction domains discovered so far, the HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide has been most widely studied. TAT fusion proteins were shown to be delivered efficiently into cultured cells, intact tissue, and live tissues when injected into mice (6Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocero-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar, 7Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 579-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Proteins delivered by this peptide retained their activity after internalization. A recent study conducted on the pharmacokinetics of TAT-β-galactosidase fusion protein, revealed that the liver is the main target for this fusion protein (8Cai S.R. Xu G. Becker-Hapak M. Ma M. Dowdy S.F. McLeod H.L. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2006; 27: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these notions we first constructed a fusion protein containing TAT fused to human PAH.To achieve even better selectivity toward delivery of the enzyme to the liver, the natural location and the site of biological activity of PAH, we also constructed a different set of PAH-based fusion proteins using human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) as the specific delivering sequence. HGF is a potent paracrine growth factor with mitogenic and morphogenic activities that is synthesized by mesenchymal cells. Liver is the main target of HGF and biological responses to this growth factor are mediated by the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the Met oncogene (cMet) (9Prat M. Narsimhan R.P. Crepaldi T. Nicotra M.R. Natali P.G. Comoglio P.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 10Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). It is the most potent mitogen for hepatocytes, and was considered to be the major growth factor responsible for driving hepatic regeneration (10Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Gherardi E. Vande Woude G.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). Research conducted on the binding properties of HGF revealed that the α-chain alone (including the N terminus and four kringle domains) can bind to the cMet receptor. This fragment however, will not induce phosphorylation of the cMet receptor, hence mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses will not be activated (11Parr C. Hiscox S. Nakamura T. Matsumoto K. Jiang W.G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore we constructed PAH fusion proteins with the HGF-α-chain as the delivering sequence. We used various fragments of the α-chain to construct NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, and αHGF-PAH. These constructs contain the N terminus fragment and kringle domains 1, 1 and 2, and 1–3 and full-length α-HGF, respectively.All the PAH-based fusion proteins were produced in bacterial cells. We show here that both TAT- and HGF-derived leading peptides/proteins can be used to deliver functional PAH into liver cells. Most importantly, we show that the Phe plasma level of C57BL normal mice treated with TAT-PAH was lowered as soon as 15 min after the intravenous administration of the fusion protein. Phe plasma levels remained low compared with untreated mice for several hours. This work demonstrates that fusion proteins could be potential candidates for treatment of metabolic diseases such as PKU.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids Encoding TAT-PAH and PAH—To construct the pET28-PAH plasmid with a His tag sequence at the 5′ side of the coding sequence, we first cut the plasmid containing the cDNA sequence of human PAH (a gift from Dr. Shwartz, Sheba Hospital, Tel Hashomer, Israel) with SpeI. The 5′ sticky end was removed with mung bean nuclease. This fragment was then cut with EcoRI generating a 1358-bp insert that was ligated into the pET28a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) cut with HindIII, followed by a mung bean nuclease reaction and a second cut with EcoRI. Escherichia coli strain DH5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for all plasmid transformations. Restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany) or New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA).The TAT-PAH plasmid was constructed using the 5′ primer: 5′-TTT GAA TTC GTC CAC TGC GGT CCT GGA A-3′; and the 3′ primer: 5′-TTT GTC GAC TTA CTT TAT TTT CTG GAG GGC A-3′. The PCR insert cut with EcoRI and SalI was ligated into the pTAT2.1 vector cut with the same enzymes (pTAT2.1 was a gift from Dr. S. Dowdy (University of California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA)).Construction of Plasmids Encoding the NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, and αHGF-PAH Fusion Proteins—The PAH plasmid was cut with EcoRI and ClaI restriction enzymes and ligated with an oligonucleotide linker containing a BstEII recognition site downstream to the PAH sequence. Linker sense: 5′-AAT TCG TTA ACA TGT GGG TGA CCG AT-3′; antisense: 5′-CGA TCG GTC ACC CA ATG TTA ACG-3′. This plasmid served as an intermediate plasmid. Total RNA was isolated from fresh human placenta with the TriPure Isolation reagent (Roche Applied Science) and then reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using a reverse transcription system (Promega, Madison, WI).The NK1, NK2, NK3, and αHGF sequences, flanked by ClaI restriction sites, were generated by PCR, using total human placenta cDNA, and the following synthetic oligonucleotide primers: HGF CT: 5′-GGA TCG ATT CGC AAT TGT TTC GT-3′; HGF NT: 5′-AGA TCG ATA TGT GGG TGA CCA AA-3′; PK1L: 5′-CCA TCG ATT TCA ACT TCT GAA CAC TG-3′; PK2L: 5′-CCA TCG ATT TCA GTT GTT TCC AAA GG-3′; and PK3L: 5′-CCA TCG ATA TCT TGT CCA TGT GAC AT-3′. These primers covered different regions of the α chain coding region of the HGF protein. HGF CT and HGF NT primers were used to construct the αHGF construct; HGF NT and PK1L primers for the NK1 construct; HGF NT and PK2L primers for the NK2 construct; and HGF NT and PK3L primers for the NK3 construct. The intermediate plasmid and PCR products were then cut by BstEII and ClaI and ligated to produce NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, and αHGF-PAH carrying plasmids (Ptrhp4, Ptrhp5, Ptrhp6, and Ptrhp7, respectively).Protein Expression and Purification of PAH and TAT-PAH Proteins—E. coli strain BL21(DE3), which carries a T7 RNA polymerase gene in a lysogenic and inducible form, was used for the expression of all fusion proteins. Cells carrying the hPAH-based plasmids were grown in LB medium containing either ampicillin (100 μg/ml) or kanamycin (100 μg/ml) according to the expression vector.After reaching an A600 value of 0.8–1, the cultures were induced for 24 h at 22 °C with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich) and supplemented with 0.02 mm FeNH4(SO4)2 (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at -70 °C for several hours. The frozen pellet was thawed and suspended in PBS with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by sonication and centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min. Both the pellet (insoluble fraction) and the supernatant (soluble fraction) were collected. The soluble fraction was then filtered and loaded on HiTrap Chelating HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) pre-loaded with NiSO4. The proteins were eluted with 80 mm histidine using theAíKTA fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The purified TAT-PAH fusion protein and the PAH protein were eluted from the column and dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.02 mm FeNH4(SO4)2 (final concentration).Protein Expression and Purification of HGF-based Proteins—The NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, and αHGF-PAH fusion proteins were expressed as described above for the TAT-PAH fusion proteins. Expressing cells were then sub-fractionized and both the supernatant (soluble fraction), and the pellet (insoluble fraction) were collected. The soluble fraction was used for further analysis.Western Blot Analysis—Samples from the various protein fractions (5–20 μg of protein/lane) were loaded on 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gels. The proteins were electrotransferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and blotted either with mouse anti-human PAH antibody (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, 1:10,000), or mouse anti-His-tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences, 1:5,000). Antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences).Phenylalanine Hydroxylation Assay—l-[U-14C]Phe and l-[U-14C]Tyr were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The PAH-based fusion proteins were tested for their enzymatic ability to hydroxylate [14C]Phe to [14C]Tyr in an in vitro cell-free assay (12Shiman R. Gray D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4793-4800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified by the use of 40 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 400 μm FeNH4(SO4)2, 4 mg/ml catalase, and 20 mm dithiothreitol (all obtained from Sigma) in a 100 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7, buffer. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C and then loaded onto 3-mm chromatography paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany), and separated with 73% butanol and 27% acetic acid as the mobile phase. Overnight film exposure revealed the relative presence of [14C]Phe and of [14C]Tyr in the reaction. Relative concentrations were calculated by processing the film with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA).Cell Lines—All cell lines were obtained from the American type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and HuH7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel). The colon adenocarcinoma Colo205 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biological Industries), cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes, and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. All cell cultures were tested for mycoplasma contamination and found to be negative.Primary Hepatocytes—Mice primary hepatocytes were obtained by perfusion of liver from C57BL female mice, age 7–8 weeks according to the method described by Berry et al. (13Berry M.N. Edwards A.M. Barritt G.J. Isolated Hepatocytes Preparation, Properties and Applications. 1991; (, pp. , Elsevier, Amsterdam): 14-58Google Scholar) with the following modifications: liver perfusion rate was 5 ml/min without recirculation of the perfusate. Cells were maintained under the same conditions as HepG2 cells.Protein Delivery into Cultured Cells—The human cell lines HepG2, HuH7, and Colo205 were incubated with PAH-based fusion proteins for various time periods, the cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the packed cell volume was determined. The packed cells were resuspended in two packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. The cells were then lysed by rapidly pushing them through a narrow pipette tip 20 times. The cell homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to obtain the cytoplasmic supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction). The internalized fusion proteins were detected in the cytoplasmic fraction by assessing cytoplasmic PAH enzymatic activity.For analysis of cells treated with PAH-based fusion proteins by confocal microscopy, HepG2 cells grown on coverslips to 50–70% confluency were treated with TAT-PAH (20 μg/ml final concentration) and NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH (2 μg/ml final concentration) for various time periods. Cells were than washed with PBS, and with 0.05% trypsin for 2 min at 37 °C, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Following a second wash, cells were incubated with mouse anti-human PAH antibody (PH8, 1:200, Chemicon) and then with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:250, Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK). Cells were then treated with RNase (20 μg/ml) and then with propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) to visualize cell nuclei. Cells were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (C1, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan).Cell Proliferation Assay—HuH7 and HepG2 cells were used to investigate the proliferative effect of PAH-based fusion proteins. 5 × 104 cells were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h prior to incubation with the proteins. TAT-PAH (20 μg/ml) and NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH (2 μg/ml) proteins were added to cells for a period of 72 h, after which Cell Titer Blue® reagent (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions to analyze cell survival.HPLC Analysis of Plasma Phenylalanine and Tyrosine Concentrations—3 C57BL female mice, 7–8 weeks old were, used for each time point. Mice were injected with 200 μl of 100 μg/ml TAT-PAH and sacrificed at various times after the injection. 0.5-ml blood samples from the mice at each time point were collected in heparin tubes (Belliver Industrial Estate, Plymouth, UK). The tubes were centrifuged at 7,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to separate the plasma. 6% trichloroacetic acid was then added to the supernatant, the tubes were centrifuged again at 20,000 × g for an additional 5 min, and the supernatant was then collected and diluted 1:10 in mobile phase for analysis. Phe levels were measured in mouse plasma by HPLC analysis similar to that described by Atherton and Green (14Atherton N.D. Green A. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34: 2241-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: the mobile phase was 7.5% acetonitrile (J. T. Baker, Deventer, Netherlands) 20 μl/liter octylamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 800 μl/liter 11.6 m perchloric acid (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Samples were separated using a C18 column (150-mm octadecylsilane, 4.6-mm pore size, Knauer, Berlin, Germany). Phe levels were detected with the Spectroflow 773 absorbance detector at 193 nm (Kratos, Kyoto, Japan) and the SP4400 integrator (Spectra Physics, San Jose, CA). Analysis was performed on a Merck HPLC system.RESULTSConstruction, Expression, Purification, and Characterization of the Fusion Proteins—We constructed plasmids encoding the PAH-based fusion proteins TAT-PAH, NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, αHGF-PAH, and PAH alone. TAT-PAH contains the delivering moiety TAT, which possesses the ability to penetrate a wide variety of eukaryotic membranes but is mainly taken up by the liver. NK1-PAH, NK2-PAH, NK3-PAH, and αHGF-PAH consist of various fragments of the human αHGF sequence as the delivering moiety, to selectively target PAH to liver cells. PAH, without a delivering domain yet with a protease cleavage sequence, was used as a control protein. The coding sequence of the proteins was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequence analysis (results not shown). Following transformation of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with one of the plasmids, expression of the fusion gene was controlled by the bacteriophage T7 late promoter. A schematic representation of the new fusion proteins is shown in Fig. 1a.Analysis of the soluble fraction of E. coli-expressing cells on SDS-PAGE gels revealed a major band of the expected molecular mass of 53 kDa corresponding to PAH and TAT-PAH proteins (Fig. 1b). These bands reacted with anti PAH antibodies (Fig. 1c) and with antibodies against the His tag (data not shown). Immunoblotting analysis of the soluble fractions of E. coli cells expressing NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH using anti-PAH antibodies revealed bands of 76 and 87 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1d). Extracts of BL21 cells expressing the NK3-PAH (97 kDa) and the αHGF-PAH (109 kDa) fusion proteins revealed that these proteins were found mainly in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1d). The soluble fraction of TAT-PAH and PAH was loaded on a nickel chelating column to affinity-purify these PAH-based proteins. Both the TAT-PAH and control PAH proteins were purified in a single step. Eluted proteins showed a major band of the expected size and were >95% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1b).Enzymatic Activity of the Proteins—TAT-PAH- and control PAH-purified proteins were tested for their PAH activity by an in vitro cell-free assay. The proteins were incubated in a reaction mixture containing the cofactors and reagents necessary for activity, and the PAH activity was monitored by following the conversion of [14C]Phe substrate into [14C]Tyr. The soluble fraction of the PAH-based proteins was found to be active in vitro, exhibiting the enzymatic activity of converting Phe to Tyr (Fig. 2). PAH and TAT-PAH proteins show a dose-dependent activity when the protein concentration is >40 ng/ml. However, at the concentration range of 40–4000 ng/ml, PAH exhibited a higher enzymatic activity than that of TAT-PAH (Fig. 2a). Further analysis conducted on both proteins revealed a higher Vmax value for the PAH enzyme (3.98 μm·min-1·μg-1 ± 0.63) than for TAT-PAH (1.76 μm·min-1·μg-1 ± 0.80). However, the Km values as calculated from this plot were the same for both proteins (9.55 μm ± 1.81 for PAH, and 9.47 μm ± 0.94 for TAT-PAH) (Fig. 2b). Thus, changes that decrease the specific activity were, most probably, induced in the PAH enzyme upon fusion with the TAT peptide. These changes however, did not cause a change in the affinity of the fusion protein to its substrate. It should be pointed out that the PAH-based proteins showed PAH enzymatic activity only in the soluble subcellular fraction. This is despite multiple efforts to denature and properly refold the highly enriched insoluble subfraction under various conditions.FIGURE 2In vitro enzymatic activity of PAH-based proteins. a, PAH and TAT-PAH dose-dependent activity, based on intensity of the [14C]Tyr signals of an in vitro enzymatic activity assay of 2 h (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). b, Lineweaver-Burk plot of PAH and TAT-PAH (determination of the Km and Vmax of PAH and TAT-PAH: 1 μg of either PAH or TAT-PAH proteins were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of [14C]Phe: 2 μm, 4 μm, and 10 μm for time points: 5, 10, and 20 min. Formation of [14C]Tyr was quantified for each reaction and used to calculate the V0 for each substrate concentration. Once V0 values were determined, they were used to calculate the Vmax and Km values. c, chromatogram showing conversion of [14C]Phe to [14C]Tyr by whole cell (W) and soluble (S) fractions of E. coli expressing NK1-PAH (1Kaufman S.

M, equal amounts of [14C]Phe and [14C]Tyr.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)An in vitro enzymatic activity test of the four HGF-targeted clones revealed that only the NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH fusion proteins retained the enzymatic activity of the PAH enzyme in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2c, lines 1 and 2). The enzymatic activity of these proteins was highly specific and dose-dependent. The soluble fraction of E. coli cells expressing NK3-PAH and αHGF-PAH did not show any activity (Fig. 2c, lines 3 and 4). As for the TAT-PAH protein, attempts made to denature and properly refold the four clones from the insoluble fraction failed and ended in a dysfunctional enzyme. Consequently, all subsequent experiments were performed with highly purified PAH-based proteins from the soluble subfraction of cells expressing TAT-PAH and PAH, or from the enriched soluble fraction of cells expressing our chimeric proteins NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH.Internalization of PAH-based Proteins Assessed by Confocal Microscopy—HepG2 and HuH7 hepatocarcinoma cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml (final concentration) TAT-PAH and 2 μg/ml (final concentration) of NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH proteins for various times. A series of experiments using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-PAH antibodies and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize the internalization of the TAT-PAH protein into cells.The images of treated cells revealed TAT-PAH within the cytoplasm of both HepG2 (Fig. 3) and HuH7 cells (data not shown) after 30-min incubation. TAT-PAH was distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm of treated cells, and showed a stronger signal with time, as compared with control cells (Fig. 3). Images of HepG2 cells treated with TAT-PAH showed a stronger signal after 2-h incubation than that of HuH7 cells treated for the same period of time (data not shown), most probably indicating a more efficient delivery of the fusion proteins into HepG2 cells.FIGURE 3Internalization of PAH-based fusion proteins visualized by confocal microscopy. HepG2 cells were treated with TAT-PAH (20 μg/ml final concentration) and NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH (2 μg/ml final concentration) for 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Cells were permeabilized and incubated with anti-PAH antibody followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody and analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscope (C1, Nikon). All images are at 1000× magnification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used two hepatocyte cell lines to test the ability of HGF targeting to deliver the PAH-based proteins into real liver target cells expressing cMet. HepG2 and HuH7 cell lines were first analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR for expression of cMet, and both of these lines were found to express this receptor in high levels (data not shown). Analysis of confocal images of HepG2 cells treated with NK1-PAH and NK2-PAH showed that these fusion proteins internalize into the cells within 10 min and that this internalization increases with time (Fig. 3). No increase in PAH was observed in the cells treated with the control PAH protein lacking a delivering domain (Fig. 3).Activity of PAH-based Proteins within Treated Cells—To assess the PAH activity of the fusion proteins after they were delivered into the cells, we lysed the treated cells with a hypotonic buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2070175548,"Cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in cells submitted to photodynamic therapy raises the question about the ability of photodynamically oxidized cytochrome c (cytc405) to trigger apoptosis as well as the effect of membranes on protein photo-oxidation. Cytochrome c was submitted to irradiation in the presence of MB+ in phosphate buffer and in the presence of four types of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cardiolipin (PCPECL) liposomes (50/30/20%): totally saturated lipids (tsPCPECL), totally unsaturated lipids (tuPCPECL), partially unsaturated (80%) lipids, with unsaturation in the PC and PE content (puPCPECL80), and partially unsaturated (20%) lipids, with unsaturation in the CL content (puPCPECL20). Cytc405 was formed by irradiation in buffered water and in tsPCPECL and puPCPECL20 liposomes. In the presence of tuPCPECL and puPCPECL80, cytochrome c was protected from photodynamic damage (lipid-protected cytochrome c). In CL liposomes, 25% unsaturated lipids were enough to protect cytochrome c. The presence of unsaturated lipids, in amounts varying according to the liposome composition, are crucial to protect cytochrome c. Interesting findings corroborating the unsaturated lipids as cytochrome c protectors were obtained from the analysis of the lipid-oxidized derivatives of the samples. Native cytochrome c, lipid-protected cytochrome c, and cytc405 were microinjected in aortic smooth muscle cells. Apoptosis, characterized by nucleus blebbing and chromatin condensation, was detected in cells loaded with native and lipid protected cytochrome c but not in cells loaded with cytc405. These results suggest that photodynamic therapy-promoted apoptosis is feasible due to the protective effect of the mitochondrial lipids on the cytochrome c structure and function. Cytochrome c-mediated apoptosis in cells submitted to photodynamic therapy raises the question about the ability of photodynamically oxidized cytochrome c (cytc405) to trigger apoptosis as well as the effect of membranes on protein photo-oxidation. Cytochrome c was submitted to irradiation in the presence of MB+ in phosphate buffer and in the presence of four types of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine/cardiolipin (PCPECL) liposomes (50/30/20%): totally saturated lipids (tsPCPECL), totally unsaturated lipids (tuPCPECL), partially unsaturated (80%) lipids, with unsaturation in the PC and PE content (puPCPECL80), and partially unsaturated (20%) lipids, with unsaturation in the CL content (puPCPECL20). Cytc405 was formed by irradiation in buffered water and in tsPCPECL and puPCPECL20 liposomes. In the presence of tuPCPECL and puPCPECL80, cytochrome c was protected from photodynamic damage (lipid-protected cytochrome c). In CL liposomes, 25% unsaturated lipids were enough to protect cytochrome c.

Singlet oxygen O2 (1Δg) can be produced in biological systems, and, due to its high electrophilicity, reactivity and relatively long lifetime (2–4 μs in H2O and ∼700 μs in CCl4) can promote damage in biological molecules (3Monroe B.M.

The pro-oxidant activity of singlet oxygen, triplet excited species, and free radicals has been used in medicine for the treatment of tumors in a process that is known as photodynamic therapy (PDT) (16Tuiete E.M. Kelly J.M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 21: 103-124Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). PDT involves in situ generation of reactive species promoting tumor regression (17Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). The mechanism of tumoral destruction involves the direct oxidation (type I mechanism) of biological targets (membranes, proteins, and DNA), as well as oxidation mediated by O2 (1Δg) (type II mechanism) (18Foote C.S. Science. 1968; 162: 963Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In the type II mechanism, O2 (1Δg) is generated through energy transfer from excited triplet species to molecular oxygen (17Henderson B.W. Dougherty T.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1992; 55: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Proteins are important targets for the pro-oxidant action of O2 (1Δg). In the case of hemeproteins, this excited species can damage both the apoproteins and the prosthetic group (19Michaeli A. Feitelson J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 61: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Michaeli A. Feitelson J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 51: 299-303Google Scholar, 21Miskoski S. Garcia N.A. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Among the potential protein targets for O2 (1Δg), cytochrome c deserves special consideration, because it is a mitochondrial protein fundamental to the cell respiration and activation of the apoptosis cascade (22Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4422) Google Scholar, 23Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 7770-7775Crossref Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Therefore, O2 (1Δg)-mediated alterations in cytochrome c structure and reactivity can influence activation of caspases in the apoptosome. Previously we compared the effect of photogenerated singlet oxygen (O2 (1Δg)) (type II mechanism) and free radicals (type I mechanism) on cytochrome c structure and reactivity. Both reactive species were obtained by photoexcitation of methylene blue (MB+) in the monomer and dimer forms obtained by varying the micelle/MB+ ratio. Over a pH range in which cytochrome c is in the native form, O2 (1Δg) and free radicals induced the conversion of heme iron from its native low spin state to a high spin state with axial symmetry (g ∼ 6.0) and with the Soret band shifted from 409 to 405 nm (cytc405). The direct attack on the heme group was only detected under conditions that favored free radical production (MB+ dimer in SDS micelles) or in the presence of a less structured form of the protein (above pH 9.3). cytc405 exhibited no alterations in the mass of heme group but showed oxidative modifications in methionine (Met-65 and Met-80) and tyrosine (Tyr-74) residues. Damage of cytc405 tyrosine residue impaired its reduction by diphenylacetaldehyde, but not by β-mercaptoethanol, which was able to reduce cytc405, generating cytochrome c Fe(II) in the high spin state (spin 2) (24Estevam M.L. Nascimento O.R. Baptista M.S. Di Mascio P. Prado F.M. Faljoni-Alario A. Zucchi M.R. Nantes I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39214-39222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Considering that PDT can induce cytochrome c detachment from the inner mitochondrial membrane leading to apoptosis, it remained to be ascertained whether the oxidative stress produced by photodynamic therapy also affects cytochrome c ability to trigger apoptosis. In this regard, the well known ability of polyunsaturated fatty acids to trap O2 (1Δg) (25Tanielian C. Mechin R. Seghrouchni R. Schweitzer C. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), points out the lipid fraction of the inner mitochondrial membrane, with which cytochrome c is peripherally associated, as a potential protector against the photodynamic protein oxidation. In this case, the attack to the inner mitochondrial membrane and membrane-bound proteins can promote lack of the transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), detachment of cytochrome c from the membrane and triggering of apoptosis in the cytosol (26Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar, 27Kawai C. Prado F.M. Nunes G.L. Di Mascio P. Carmona-Ribeiro A.M. Nantes I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34709-34717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this regard, in a model system, liposomes containing polyunsaturated lipids were able to protect cytochrome c from the attack by free radicals produced in the course of the reaction of the protein with t-butylhydroperoxide (28Nantes I.L. Faljoni-Alario A. Nascimento O.R. Bandy B. Gatti R. Bechara E.J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 786-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the ability of mitochondrial lipids to protect cytochrome c against photodynamic oxidation and the loss of the ability to trigger apoptosis. Chemicals—Cytochrome c (horse heart, type III) was acquired from Sigma. Lipids were acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). MB+ was purchased from Aldrich and twice recrystallized using ethanol. Generation of O2 (1Δg) by Photosensitization of MB+—Samples were irradiated at 35 °C in a glass chamber, in 5 mm phosphate-buffered water or in 5 mm phosphate-buffered liposomes (PCPECL or CL). A 500-watt halogen light bulb, set at a distance of 30 cm, was used with a cutoff glass filter (500 nm ± 50 nm; wavelength mean value ± half bandwidth, Melles Griot, CA). The glass chamber was cooled by circulating water. Other additions are indicated in the figure legends. Purification of Cytochrome c Modified by Reactive Species—The samples containing cytochrome c with Soret band peaking at 405 nm (cytc405) obtained in buffered water were purified with Chelex 100®, which has a binding affinity for MB+. Purification of MB+ with Chelex 100® particles was monitored by spectrophotometry, indicating the disappearance of the MB+ absorbance spectrum. The samples containing cytochrome c submitted to MB+ photodynamic action associated with PCPECL liposomes were purified in a fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with two P-500 pumps, a Superdex HR200 column, and a UV-visible detector. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min, and the buffer consisted of 0.3 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The high ionic strength buffer was used to promote dissociation of cytochrome c from the liposomes. The liposomes were eluted in the void volume, cytochrome c was included in the resin, and MB+ was eluted in the total volume of the beds. The elution of liposomes, cytochrome c, and MB+ was monitored by turbidity at 280 nm, absorbance at 409 nm (Soret band peak), and absorbance at 660 nm, respectively. The fractions that contained cytochrome c were pooled and dialyzed exhaustively against deionized water. After dialysis the sample was lyophilized. Electronic Absorption Spectrometry—Electronic absorption measurements of cytochrome c were conducted in a photodiode spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments Inc., Columbia, MD), using quartz cuvettes of 1-cm light path and a slit of 0.5 nm. Preparation and Analysis of Liposomes—Lipids were first dissolved in chloroform, which was evaporated with N2 gas. The lipid residue was kept under reduced pressure for at least 2 h, after which it was hydrated by adding cold 5 mm phosphate buffer. After the addition of buffer, the mixture was then stirred with a vortex, and sonication was performed in a Ney Ultrasonik sonicator (J. M. Ney Co., Bloomfield, CT) during 30 min. The mean diameter of sonicated unilamellar liposomes was previously determined (27Kawai C. Prado F.M. Nunes G.L. Di Mascio P. Carmona-Ribeiro A.M. Nantes I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34709-34717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as being 61.1 ± 0.3 nm by dynamic light scattering using a ZetaPlus-ZetaPotential analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corp., Holtsville, NY). When indicated, unilamellar liposomes were also obtained by extrusion of hydrated lipid dispersions in an Avanti Mini-extruder acquired from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Samples were subjected to 11 passes through two polycarbonate filters (100 nm pore size, Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) installed in tandem. The mean diameter of both sonicated and extruded liposomes was in agreement with images obtained by atomic force microscopy in an SPM 9600 scanning probe microscope (Shimadzu Corp.). Atomic force microscopy images (Fig. 1, A and B) were obtained by measurement of the interaction forces between the tip and the sample surface (29Ruozi B. Tosi G. Forni F. Fresta M. Vandelli M.A. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2005; 25: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Yalamanchili M.R. Veeramasuneni S. Miller J.D. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1996; 184: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) containing liposomes. The samples were analyzed in the contact mode at room temperature (20 °C) and atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg). A triangular silicon tip was used for this analysis, and the resonant frequencies of the cantilever were found to be ∼200 kHz. Cardiolipin liposome films were obtained by immobilization on silicon-based support. Immediately before the analysis, the samples of fresh liposomes were diluted to 1 mm in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and a droplet of constant volume (10 μl) was deposited onto a small plate of silicon (∼0.5 cm2) previously submitted to stringent cleaning (31Jass J. Torbjorn T. Puu A. Gertrud E. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 367: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 2 min after deposition on the silicon plate, the sample excess was removed by using filter paper, and the drying was completed at 4 °C. Lipid Oxidation Assays—Oxidative damage of liposomes was measured by dosage of the lipid hydroperoxide and malonyldialdehyde content. Lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) measurement was done by oxidation of Fe2+ in the presence of xylenol orange. Sonicated unilamellar liposomes (1 mm) were incubated in the presence or in the absence of 4 μm cytochrome c and/or 8 μm MB+ during 30 min, at 4 °C. An aliquot of the sample (50 μl) was mixed, and the mixture was incubated during 30 min at room temperature (25 °C) with 950 μl of hydroperoxide reagent, containing 100 μm xylenol orange, 250 μm (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, 25 mm H2SO4 and 4 mm butylated hydroxytoluene in 90% methanol. The oxidation of Fe2+ by LOOH generates Fe3+ that reacts with xylenol orange forming the colored compound that absorbs at 560 nm. LOOH concentration was calculated from ϵ560 nm = 4.3 × 104 m-1 cm-1. For the determination of MDA content present in liposomes, samples of lipids (1 mm) were incubated in the presence or absence of 4 μm cytochrome c and/or 8 μm MB+ during 30 min, at 4 °C (final volume, 150 μl). To determine malonyldialdehyde (MDA), 150 μl of 1% thiobarbituric acid prepared in 50 mm NaOH plus 15 μl of 10 m NaOH and 75 μl of 20% H3PO4 was added to the sample, followed by further incubation during 20 min at 85 °C. The MDA-thiobarbituric acid complex was extracted with 300 μl of n-butanol, and the absorbance was measured at 532 nm. MDA concentration was calculated from ϵ532 nm = 1.56 × 105 m-1 cm-1. Cell Culture and Apoptosis Assay—Rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 μg/ml G418, and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. Cells were plated on glass cell locate coverslips (Eppendorf) at a density of 40,000/well in 24-well plates for 17–20 h prior to microinjection. Following microinjection, flat cells (normal) and round/shrunken cells with condensed nuclei (apoptotic) were counted and are presented as percent apoptotic cells. In microinjection experiments, 50 cells were counted for each condition. Microinjection—Cell microinjection was performed on the stage of a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope using an Eppendorf pressure injector (model 5246) and micromanipulator (model 5171). Microinjection needles (∼0.1-μm inner diameter) were pulled from glass capillaries using a horizontal electrode puller (Sutter Instrument, model P-97) and loaded using Eppendorf microloaders. Cells were plated on glass cell locate coverslips (Eppendorf) 24 h prior to injection. To identify injected cells, the solution for microinjection contained 0.3% dextran-conjugated Texas Red dye (Mr 10,000, lysine-fixable, Molecular Probes) in H2O. Dye alone or dye plus cytochrome c (Sigma, C7752 from horse heart, diluted in H2O and freshly prepared for each experiment) was injected into the cytoplasm of cells (pressure, 80–100 hPa; time, 0.3 s). Cells were switched into fresh medium immediately after injection. The intracellular concentrations of microinjected proteins are estimated to represent a 10- to 100-fold dilution of the pipette concentration based on previous calibrations using similar microinjection apparatus and an estimated cellular volume of 4–5 pl (32Li F. Srinivasan A. Wang Y. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30299-30305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, we estimate that the amount of cytochrome c injected is proportional to the pipette concentration and that 40–400 fg are delivered when the pipette concentration is 1 mg/ml. Accordingly, with a pipette concentration of 30 mg/ml (our maximal concentration) we estimate that 1.2–12 pg per cell are delivered. At various times, injected cells were scored for apoptosis as described above. After scoring for apoptosis, Hoechst dye 33342 (Sigma) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 120 min and photographed under UV light. Caspase-3 Fluorometric Assay—SMCs were collected, counted, and centrifuged at 250 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was gently removed and discarded, and the cell pellet was lysed by the addition of Cell Lysis Buffer (R&D Systems) according to the number of cells present in the pellet (25 μl of cold Cell Lysis Buffer per 1 × 106 cells). This number can be estimated from the number of initially cultured cells. The cells were incubated for 10 min, and the amount of protein was determined by BCA protein assay. For the reaction, 100 μl of cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 2× Reaction Buffer (R&D Systems) and 3 ml of fresh dithiothreitol stock solution. To each reaction well 25 μm native cytochrome c, lipid-protected cytochrome c, or cytc405 was added prior to the addition of 10 ml of Caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate (DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin). The plate was incubated for 2 h, and the fluorescence was read (excitation at 400 nm and reading at 505 nm). Statistical Analysis—The statistical analysis for Figs. 4A, 4B, 4C, 6, and 7 data were done by using analysis of variance calculating software (GraphPad). The post-hoc tests (Bonferroni correction) were done by using QuickCalcs (GraphPad).FIGURE 6Percentage of apoptotic nuclei in SMCs scored after microinjection procedures. The percentage of apoptotic nuclei in SMCs was scored 2 h after the microinjection of saline-buffered medium (control), saline-buffered medium plus methylene blue (MB+), saline-buffered medium plus native cytochrome c (native cytc), saline-buffered medium plus cytochrome c 405 (cytc405), and saline-buffered medium plus lipid-protected cytochrome c (lipid-protect cytc).

The liposome composition differed according to the saturation degree of the lipid acyl chains: totally saturated lipids (tsPCPECL), totally unsaturated lipids (tuPCPECL), partially unsaturated (80%) lipids, with unsaturation in the PC and PE content (puPCPECL80), and partially unsaturated (20%) lipids, with unsaturation in the CL content (puPCPECL20). Fig. 2A shows the alterations in the cytochrome c spectra promoted by O2 (1Δg), in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Singlet oxygen was generated by the irradiation of MB+ with a 500-watt halogen lamp. As previously described, upon irradiation, two phenomena occurred concomitantly: the reduction of cytochrome c by excited MB+ and irreversible conversion of cytochrome c Fe(II) to Fe(III) mediated by O2 (1Δg) associated with blue shift of the Soret band compatible with the formation of cytc405 (24Estevam M.L. Nascimento O.R. Baptista M.S. Di Mascio P. Prado F.M. Faljoni-Alario A. Zucchi M.R. Nantes I.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39214-39222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A percentage of reduced cytochrome c can be identified in the spectrum obtained after 10 min of irradiation that exhibited Q bands β and α (indicated in the figure) overlapped by the MB+ spectrum. Fig. 2B shows the spectra of cytochrome c associated with tuPCPECL and obtained at 0, 5, and 10 min after the irradiation in the same conditions. The presence of tuPCPECL promoted significant differences in cytochrome c and MB+ behavior during the irradiation. In this condition, the cytochrome c Soret band did not exhibit progressive blue shift but only bleaching. On the other hand, the presence of unsaturated lipids drastically increased MB+ bleaching percentage exhibited after 10 min under irradiation (87%) as compared with aqueous buffered medium (10%). Fig. 2C shows the spectra of cytochrome c and MB+ obtained before and after 5- and 10-min exposure to the halogen lamp. In this condition, after 5 min of irradiation, 300 mm NaCl was added to the medium to promote cytochrome c dissociation from the liposome surface. The irradiation of the system after increase of ionic strength did not promote significant cytochrome c bleaching when compared with Fig. 2B. This result suggests that cytochrome c bleaching was promoted by free radicals generated in the membrane. The addition of 300 mm NaCl led to a progressive increase in turbidity of the sample, and thus, it was not possible to get UV-visible spectra at 50 min. Because of high turbidity of the sample containing NaCl, the spectra obtained at 50 min were omitted from Fig. 2 (B and C). Fig. 2D shows the alterations in the cytochrome c and MB+ spectra during the irradiation with visible light in the presence of puPCPECL80. For cytochrome c, the result obtained in this condition was quite similar to that obtained in the presence of tuPCPECL, an expected result due to the high content of unsaturated lipids present in puPCPECL80. Considering that in this model of membrane the CL content consists exclusively of the saturated form of the lipid, this result suggests that the electrostatic and principally lipid-extended interaction of CL with cytochrome c did not affect the impairment of cytochrome c blue shift observed in the presence of tuPCPECL. However, in the presence of saturated CL, a decrease in the degree of MB+ bleaching (from 87% to 70%) was observed. Fig. 2, E and F, and their insets, show, respectively, the results obtained in the presence of puPCPECL20 and tsPCPECL. In the presence of puPCPECL20 and tsPCPECL, photodynamically generated O2 (1Δg) led to the blue shift of cytochrom"

Vertebrate A-type lamins are expressed in differentiating cells, while B-type lamins are expressed ubiquitously. Drosophila has two lamin genes that are expressed in A- and B-type patterns, and it is assumed that similarly expressed lamins perform similar functions. However, Drosophila and vertebrate lamins are not orthologous, and their expression patterns evolved independently. It is therefore of interest to examine the effects of mutations in lamin genes. Mutations in the mammalian lamin A/C gene cause a range of diseases, collectively called laminopathies, that include muscular dystrophies and premature aging disorders. We compared the sequences of lamin genes from different species, and we have characterized larval and adult phenotypes in Drosophila bearing mutations in the lam gene that is expressed in the B-type pattern. Larvae move less and show subtle muscle defects, and surviving lam adults are flightless and walk like aged wild-type flies, suggesting that lam phenotypes might result from neuromuscular defects, premature aging, or both. The resemblance of Drosophila lam phenotypes to human laminopathies suggests that some lamin functions may be performed by differently expressed genes in flies and mammals. Such still-unknown functions thus would not be dependent on lamin gene expression pattern, suggesting the presence of other lamin functions that are expression dependent. Our results illustrate a complex interplay between lamin gene expression and function through evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2064739187,"Activation of PPARgamma in MOSER cells inhibits anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth and invasion through Matrigel-coated transwell membranes. We carried out a longitudinal two-class microarray analysis in which mRNA abundance was measured as a function of time in cells treated with a thiazolidinedione PPARgamma agonist or vehicle. A statistical machine learning algorithm that employs an empirical Bayesian implementation of the multivariate HotellingT2 score was used to identify differentially regulated genes. HotellingT2 scores, MB statistics, and maximum median differences were used as figures of merit to interrogate genomic ontology of these targets. Three major cohorts of genes were regulated: those involved in metabolism, DNA replication, and migration/motility, reflecting the cellular phenotype that attends activation of PPARgamma. The bioinformatic analysis also inferred that PPARgamma regulates calcium signaling. This response was unanticipated, because calcium signaling has not previously been associated with PPARgamma activation. Ingenuity pathway analysis inferred that the nodal point in this cross-talk was Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1). DSCR1 is an endogenous calcineurin inhibitor that blocks dephosphorylation and activation of members of the cytoplasmic component of nuclear factor of activated T cells transcription factors. Lentiviral short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of DSCR1 blocks PPARgamma inhibition of proliferation and invasion, indicating that DSCR1 is required for suppression of transformed properties of early stage colorectal cancer cells by PPARgamma. These data reveal a novel, heretofore unappreciated link between PPARgamma and calcium signaling and indicate that DSCR1, which has previously been thought to function by suppression of the angiogenic response in endothelial cells, may also play a direct role in transformation of epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2166392036,"Carboxylesterase-based metabolic resistance to organophosphates (OPs) in insects has been shown to originate either from mutations in esterase-encoding sequences or from amplification of esterase genes. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that mosquitoes can acquire OP resistance by functional changes in carboxylesterases. Mutations were introduced into the esterase B1 of mosquito Culex pipiens by site-directed mutagenesis at positions 110 and 224. Three single mutants (G110D, W224L, and W224S) and two double mutants (G110D/W224L and G110D/W224S) were expressed and purified. All five mutants lost native carboxylesterase activity. Mutation W224L converted esterase B1 to an OP hydrolase and increased its malathion carboxylesterase activity. No obvious OP hydrolysis was observed by G110D or W224S. Our data strongly support our hypothesis and suggest that mutation W224L might occur in natural populations of mosquitoes. Sequence comparison shows that the site 224 is especially highly conserved among various insect carboxylesterases. This leads to another hypothesis: that the position 224 plays a key role in insect carboxylesterases' switching from their native physiological functions to other functional niches under selection pressure exerted by insecticides."
https://openalex.org/W1978120052,"The Xenopus X29 protein was identified by its high affinity binding to U8 small nucleolar RNA, a small nucleolar RNA required for ribosome biogenesis. X29 and its human homologue H29K (Nudt16) are nuclear nucleoside diphosphatase proteins localized within foci in the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. These proteins can remove m7G and m227G caps from RNAs, rendering them substrates for 5′-3′ exonucleases for degradation in vivo. Here, a more complete characterization of these metal-dependent decapping proteins demonstrates that the metal identity determines both the efficiency of decapping and the RNA substrate specificity.

Although DNA transcription is the first level of regulation of gene expression, more extensive modulation of RNA abundance is post-transcriptional. Various nuclear and cytoplasmic events act together to alter the steady-state balance of cellular RNAs, including RNA capping, RNA splicing/processing, nuclear export, localization within the cytoplasm, translation, and a surveillance mechanism to identify and eliminate aberrant RNAs (1Burge C.B.

The alternative RNA turnover pathway involves 5′-3′ exonucleases, which degrade the RNA after the 5′-cap has been removed. The “decapping” activity is attributable to a nucleoside diphosphatase hydrolase acting upon full-length RNA; they release m7GDP and leave a 5′-monophosphate on the 5′-end of the RNA.

In vitro, Dcp2 lacks substrate specificity, cleaving all capped RNAs more than 40 nucleotides in length. Cleavage results in accumulation of m7GDP and leaves a 5′-monophosphate on the RNA. In vivo this would be a substrate for 5′-3′ exonucleases (reviewed in Refs. 8Coller J. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 861-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar and 29Tucker M. Parker R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 571-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Decapping is poly(A)-dependent (requires a shortened poly(A) tail) and requires metal (Mg+2 or Mn+2) for hydrolysis. The authentic in vivo substrate, means of substrate recognition, or RNA specificity have not been identified for the cytoplasmic Dcp2 decapping protein, perhaps because there is no RNA substrate specificity. Subcellular localization of Dcp2 has also provided clues about its role in vivo. Dcp2 is concentrated in cytoplasmic foci, called P-bodies (processing bodies) where it co-localizes with other known or putative RNA decay factors. RNAs destined for turnover are believed to be delivered to these foci for degradation (32Van Dijk E. Cougot N. Meyer S. Babajko S. Wahle E. Seraphin B.

Our recent identification of X29, a nuclear-localized NUDIX protein with decapping activity, suggests that it is the nuclear counterpart to the cytoplasmic decapping enzyme. The Xenopus X29, and its human homologue (H29K), are concentrated within foci in the nucleoplasm and nucleoli (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of X29 confirmed the presence of a NUDIX fold and demonstrated a homodimeric quaternary structure in this protein (42Scarsdale J.N. Peculis B.A. Wright H.T. Structure. 2006; 14: 331-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It also revealed a requirement for a nucleotide or nucleoside in the recruitment of metals to the active site of X29 and suggested a basis for the observed cooperativity in metal binding to the enzyme. Here we provide a more complete biochemical characterization of the decapping activity of the Xenopus and the human nuclear decapping proteins. In vitro assay conditions were optimized by altering salts, buffers, and both protein and RNA concentrations to obtain the most efficient decapping activity. Next, the three metals that were found to function as cofactors were titrated, and the enzyme activity and substrate specificity was examined for each metal:protein combination. Although only three metals would support cap hydrolysis by these nuclear NUDIX proteins, each metal had different optimal concentrations resulting in different cleavage efficiency. Most striking and unique are the findings that the metal identity determined both the substrate specificity as well as the efficiency of decapping. In Mg+2 cap hydrolysis is highly specific for U8 snoRNA; in Mn+2 there is broad RNA substrate specificity, and all RNAs are decapped at high efficiency. These data raise the intriguing possibility that the identity of the metal binding the protein in vivo would determine the RNA substrate specificity, and these NUDIX decapping proteins may be the nuclear counterpart of the cytoplasmic decapping machinery involved in RNA decay. Decapping Reaction—RNA for the decapping assay was labeled as previously described (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Unless a specific parameter was being tested (time, temperature, pH, metal, RNA, or protein titrations), the decapping reactions were assembled by combining 0.12 pmol of m7GpppG cap-labeled RNA (24 nm) with 45 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 1 μl of the appropriate metal (5× stock). The reaction volume was achieved with the addition of 1.2 pmol (240 nm) of the appropriate protein, which was always added last. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min then stopped by adding EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm. Reactions were spotted on a PEI TLC plate (Sigma) and developed with LiCl/formic acid as described previously (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Quantitation of TLC Plates—The percent decapping was calculated by exposing the developed TLC plate to a phosphorimaging screen (Fuji). The Fuji Image Gauge software was used to quantitate the intensity of the signal at the origin (uncapped RNA) and the intensity of the signal at the place on the plate that corresponded to m7GDP, based on the mobility of standards. An additional “background” value was obtained from an area on the TLC plate not containing a sample lane. Values obtained from Image Gauge software were used to determine percent decapping calculated as: [(counts migrating at m7GDP – background)/(counts at m7GDP – background) + (counts at origin – background)] × 100, which was then used to determine the amount of product (m7GDP) released. All decapping samples were repeated a minimum of three times, using freshly diluted protein each time, on different batches of cap-labeled RNA. Data presented are an average of a minimum of three samples from at least three different batches of labeled RNA. Metal Titration to Examine Decapping Efficiency—RNA for the decapping assay was transcribed using a method as described previously (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The decapping reactions contained 24 nm m7GpppG cap-labeled RNA and 240 nm protein. Decapping reactions combined m7GpppG cap-labeled RNA, 45 mm Tris, pH 8.5, to which the appropriate concentration of metal (from a 5× stock) was added followed by protein. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stopped by addition of EDTA, spotted onto a TLC plate, and developed in LiCl/formic acid as described before (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and then quantitated as above. Time Course Experiments—All time course experiments were performed in a single tube as a scaled-up (typically 3-fold) reaction. The tube was placed at 37 °C at time “0.” At the appropriate time point a 1.8-μl aliquot was removed and transferred to a tube containing 0.2 μl of 500 mm EDTA to stop the reaction and stored at 4 °C until all time points were collected. Plates were spotted and developed as usual. Experiments involving addition of “more” reagents were performed in a single tube, typically as a 9× (45 μl) reaction. These reactions were initiated by addition of protein in a rate-limiting quantity and incubation at 37 °C (and defined as time 0); aliquots were removed, and the reactions were stopped at the indicated times as described above. After 10 min 30 μl of the reaction was transferred to a fresh tube at 37 °C containing additional protein (from 2- to 10-fold more protein in a volume of <1 μl), and time points were taken as described above. Ten minutes into this “more protein” incubation, 15 μl was transferred to a fresh tube containing additional RNA (from 2- to 10-fold more RNA in a volume of <0.5 μl). All samples were spotted onto a TLC plate, developed, imaged, and quantitated as above. Transcription Templates—Templates for RNA transcription included U8 snoRNA (43Peculis B.A. Steitz J.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1233-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), U3 snoRNA (44Baserga S.J. Yang X.D. Steitz J.A.

Unlabeled, uncapped transcripts were cap-labeled as described (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and gel purified for use in decapping reactions. Inhibition of Decapping by Product—A standard decapping reaction was set up, except that prior to addition of protein, the putative inhibitor to be assayed was added to the reaction and mixed gently. Final concentrations of 0.1 mm or 2 mm of each putative inhibitor were used. Decapping reactions contained either 200 μm Mn+2, 1 mm Mn+2, or 2 mm Mg+2. Putative inhibitors examined included GMP, GDP, GTP, dGDP, m7G, m7GDP, and m7GTP. Generating Mutations in X29 Protein—The pET19b plasmid encoding X29 cDNA was mutagenized with QuikChange (Stratagene), as per the manufacturer's recommendations, using the following pairs of deoxyoligonucleotides (provided below in 5′→3′ orientation): R88Ls, CTGGAAGAAGGTCTGAAACTGGAGTTGGAAGAGGAACTGGGTCC; R88Lα, GGACCCAGTTCCTCTTCCAACTCCAGTTTCAGACCTTCTTCCAG; R89Qs, CTGGAAGAAGGTCTGAAAGGCAGTTGGAAGAGGAACTGGGTCC; E89Qα, GGACCCAGTTCCTCTTCCAACTGCCGTTTCAGACCTTCTTCCAG; E92Qs, GGTCTGAAACGGGAGTTGGAACAGGAACTGGGTCCTGCTCTCGCAACGGTGG; E92Qα, CCACCGTTGCGAGAGCAGGACCCAGTTCCTGTTCCAACTCCCGTTTCAGACC; E93Qs, GGTCTGAAACGGGAGTTGGAAGAGCAGCTGGGTCCTGCTCTCGCACGGTGG; E93Qα, CCACCGTTGCGAGAGCAGGACCCAGCTGCTCTTCCAACTCCCGTTTCAGACC; EE9293QQs, GGTCTGAAACGGGAGTTGGAACAGCAGCTGGGTCCTGCTCTCGCAACGGTGG; and EE9293QQα, CCACCGTGCGAGAGCAGGACCCAGCTGCTGTTCCAACTCCCGTTTCAGACC. The resulting constructs were verified by sequencing, and BL21 cells were used to overexpress proteins, which were purified via our now-standard methods. Gel Filtration—Purified X29 proteins (overexpressed in bacteria or isolated from Xenopus ovary) was loaded on an S300 column on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences), and fractions were eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl plus 1 mm EDTA. Gel-filtration molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) were used to calibrate the column and typically occurred between each sample run to ensure reproducibility. Eluted samples were collected in 50-μl fractions and examined by SDS-PAGE to verify the identity of the eluted proteins. The proteins that eluted at 60-kDa co-migrated with the authentic X29 near 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels. Results were identical regardless of origin of protein sample (bacteria or frog tissue). Protein-Protein Cross-linking—Protein-protein cross-linking was done using the water-soluble, reversible cross-linker 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) (Pierce) and the water-soluble, non-reversible cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3, Pierce). Proteins used in these reactions were first dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.3, and 300 mm NaCl. The cross-link reaction contained 40 pmol of protein in a 50-μl reaction containing H1 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl). The respective cross-linker, made fresh immediately prior to use, was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Protein and cross-linker were combined and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cross-linkers were quenched with Tris, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 20 mm. Samples were split into two aliquots, one receiving non-reducing SDS sample buffer, the other receiving SDS sample buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol to reverse the cross-link. After heating, samples were resolved on a 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel then stained with Coomassie Blue. The Xenopus X29 protein was initially identified by column purification and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) because of its high affinity and high specificity of binding to U8 snoRNA (48Tomasevic N.

We cloned and over-expressed both the Xenopus protein and the human homologue of this protein in bacteria. In vitro analysis of the recombinant proteins demonstrated that the Xenopus X29 protein and its human homologue (H29K) are nuclear/nucleolar proteins capable of removing m7G and m2,2,7G caps from the 5′-end of U8 snoRNA (41Ghosh T.

Here we characterize and compare the metal-dependant decapping activity of these two proteins and examine the role of various amino acids in the hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by these proteins. Optimization of Assay Conditions—Decapping reactions contain “cap labeled” RNA, generated by incubating in vitro transcribed RNA with guanylyltransferase, [α-32P]GTP and S-adenocylomethionine. This results in m7GpppG-RNA with a single radioactive phosphate in the α position (indicated in bold). Ammonium ions, frequently present in decapping assays (26Dunckley T. Parker R.

Y.). 2003; 9: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), resulted in decreased decapping efficiency of X29 and the human 29K protein and was omitted from these reactions. Reducing agents had no effect on decapping efficiency. We previously demonstrated that the optimum pH for decapping is near pH 9; all reactions here were performed at pH 8.5 to ensure sufficient buffering capacity of the reagents used. EMSA analysis demonstrated that, in the presence of 10-fold molar excess of protein over U8 snoRNA and 250-fold molar excess nonspecific (tRNA) competitor, at least 50% of the input U8 snoRNA was bound by X29 protein. The examination of the ratio of protein to RNA is addressed below. If tRNA was omitted, 100% of the RNA was bound by protein at this molar ratio (data not shown). To assay decapping, substrate (cap-labeled U8 snoRNA, 0.12 pmol) was combined with 1.2 pmol of X29 protein in the presence of metal cation and no tRNA. Time course of incubation experiments (below) were performed to ensure the decapping efficiency (defined as the fraction of total RNA substrate converted to product) was examined at a point when the reaction had gone to completion. Thus, for many of these assays, the kinetics were not being measured, rather, the overall efficiency of the reaction was assessed. RNA decapping efficiency was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reaction Had Gone to Completion When Decapping Efficiency Was Assessed—Time course experiments were performed to determine the required incubation time for some of these experiments. Large, batch reactions containing cap-labeled U8 snoRNA, metal, and X29 protein were assembled. In some cases, lower than optimal amounts of metal were used to slow the reaction, ensure a more accurate determination of efficiency, and determine the minimum amount of metal required for catalysis. At time = 0 an aliquot was removed and ETDA was added. The remainder of the reaction was placed at 37 °C. At the appropriate time, aliquots were removed from the reaction and transferred to a tube containing EDTA to chelate the metal and stop the reaction. When the entire time course was collected, aliquots from each time point were spotted on TLC plates, developed, and quantitated to determine the amount of decapping at each time point. U8 snoRNA decapping was metal-dependent and protein concentration-dependent. The product accumulation increased linearly for the first ∼10 min of incubation (data not shown, see Fig. 5, A and B). Additional incubation past this time point did not result in significant additional accumulation of m7GDP. Thus, the maximum amount of hydrolysis in the presence of limiting metal was achieved within the first 10 min of incubation. Longer incubations (30 min at 37 °C) were used in some cases to ensure the reaction went to completion. In addition to the longer time point, steady-state analyses to compare the overall efficiency of decapping, kinetic analyses were also performed to address the rate of reaction under conditions where substrate, metal, or enzyme were limiting to more directly address enzyme activity in these reactions (see below). Metal Is Required for X29 Catalysis—The cytoplasmic NUDIX decapping protein, Dcp2, requires metal for hydrolysis of cap from RNA. Mg+2 will support cleavage, but Dcp2 has slightly higher efficiency in the presence of Mn+2 (15Wang Z. Jiao X. Carr-Schmid A. Kiledjian M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Carr-Schmid A. Schwartz D.C. Kiledjian M. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 2003; 9: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast, the nuclear NUDIX decapping protein, X29, displayed metal-dependent hydrolysis of both the m7G cap (releasing m7GDP) and the m2,2,7G cap (present on mature U8 snoRNPs in vivo) from U8 snoRNA (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). X29 protein can bind U8 snoRNA in the presence of 20 mm EDTA (determined by EMSA) (41Ghosh T. Peterson B. Tomasevic N. Peculis B. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), so metal is not required for the RNA binding; however, metal is required for either reorganization of the active site and/or for the chemistry of cap hydrolysis. Titration of metal and assessment of decapping efficiency examined the effect of metal upon catalysis. To determine which metals are capable of conferring RNA cap-hydrolysis activity on X29 protein under these optimized reaction conditions, a panel of metals was surveyed in the decapping reaction of U8 snoRNA. Results indicated that magnesium, manganese, and cobalt allowed hydrolysis. Nickel, lithium, sodium, and calcium did not confer cleavage activity (data not shown). These ions were of particular interest, because they are present during protein purification in buffers, reagents, or assays, and it was important to determine whether we unintentionally “primed” or loaded the protein with metal by even transie"
https://openalex.org/W2165947898,"Ring contraction during cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis requires a seemingly futile methylation of the C20 position of the tetrapyrrole framework. Along the anaerobic route, this reaction is catalyzed by CbiL, which transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to cobalt factor II to generate cobalt factor III. CbiL belongs to the class III methyltransferases and displays similarity to other cobalamin biosynthetic methyltransferases that are responsible for the regiospecific methylation of a number of positions on the tetrapyrrole molecular canvas. In an attempt to understand how CbiL selectively methylates the C20 position, a detailed structure function analysis of the enzyme has been undertaken. In this paper, we demonstrate that the enzyme methylates the C20 position, that its preferred substrate is cobalt factor II, and that the metal ion does not undergo any oxidation change during the course of the reaction. The enzyme was crystallized, and its structure was determined by x-ray crystallography, revealing that the 26-kDa protein has a similar overall topology to other class III enzymes. This helped in the identification of some key amino acid residues (Asp104, Lys176, and Tyr220). Analysis of mutant variants of these groups has allowed us to suggest potential roles that these side chains may play in substrate binding and catalysis.

The chemical logic underpinning the methylation is discussed. Cobalamin (vitamin B12) (Fig. 1a) is a modified tetrapyrrole that differs from other members of this fraternity, such as heme and chlorophyll, in that the macrocycle has been contracted by loss of one of the bridging carbons of the molecular framework. Cobalamin biosynthesis is mediated via an elaborate pathway that requires the deployment of somewhere around 30 enzymes for its complete de novo synthesis (1Blanche F. Cameron B. Crouzet J.

Rep. 2002; 19: 390-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The situation is complicated further by the presence in nature of two similar but biochemically and genetically distinct syntheses (5Blanche F. Thibaut D. Debussche L. Hertle R. Zipfel F. Muöller G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1993; 32: 1651-1653Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These pathways are referred to as the aerobic or cobalt-late and anaerobic or cobalt-early routes (7Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson S.W. Warren M.J. Bioorganic Chem. 1999; 27: 100-118Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As their names suggest, the pathways differ in their requirement for molecular oxygen and the timing of cobalt insertion. The variance in the pathway is associated with the biosynthesis of the corrin ring component of cobalamin and in particular the events that see the transformation of the first macrocyclic intermediate uroporphyrinogen III into cobyric acid. This transformation includes the addition of eight S-adenosyl-l-methioine (SAM) 3The abbreviations used are: SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; SUMT, S-adenosyl-l-methionine uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid. 3The abbreviations used are: SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine; SUMT, S-adenosyl-l-methionine uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; ALA, 5-aminolevulinic acid.-derived methyl groups to the tetrapyrrole scaffold, although only seven are observed in the final product, since one is lost during the ring contraction process (Fig. 1a). An interesting question to address is the rationale behind why there are so many methylations during cobalamin biosynthesis. The methylations are largely associated with prototrophic rearrangements and arguably evolved to prevent oxidation of the corrin as the earth's environment became more oxidizing (8Eschenmoser A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1988; 27: 5-39Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In so doing, some of the methylation processes, such as those associated with C17 and C1, have become associated with ring contraction and elimination of the extruded carbon fragment. An underappreciated yet pivotal reaction of the ring contraction process is methylation at C20. Although in principle it appears futile to methylate a carbon that is subsequently lost, chemical studies have shown that ring contraction only occurs if this position is derivatized into a tertiary alcohol (8Eschenmoser A. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1988; 27: 5-39Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b), and this is achieved, initially, through methylation (Fig. 1c). An understanding of the chemical logic of cobalamin synthesis revolves around the modifications that take place on C20, and this paper directly addresses this issue through the study of the anaerobic pathway C20 methyltransferase, CbiL. CbiL was first identified as the C20 methyltransferase when the Salmonella enterica enzyme was reported to be able to methylate precorrin-2, albeit in very low yields (9Roessner C.A. Spencer J.B. Ozaki S. Min C. Atshaves B.P. Nayar P. Anousis N. Stolowich N.J. Holderman M.T. Scott A.I. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Sometime later, the S. enterica enzyme was shown to have a preference for metal-containing substrates (10Spencer P. Stolowich N.J. Sumner L.W. Scott A.I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14917-14927Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The enzyme was shown to be able to methylate both cobalt-precorrin-2 and cobalt factor II, as well as zinc derivatives. Moreover, the enzyme does not apparently discriminate on the basis of the oxidation state of the metal ion and was found to methylate both Co(II) and Co(III) forms. However, no rates were given for the reaction, and thus no substrate preference was identified. Therefore, there remains some dispute as to the true identity of the pathway intermediate (2Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 7331-7334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Santander P.J. Kajiwara Y. Williams H.J. Scott A.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006; 14: 724-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Very recently, a structure of an enzyme purported to be CbiL, based solely on sequence similarity and with no supporting functional data, has been reported (12Wada K. Harada J. Yaeda Y. Tamiaki H. Oh-Oka H. Fukuyama K. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis has revealed that many of the enzymes of the aerobic and anaerobic pathways are similar, suggesting that the two pathways have a common evolutionary origin (3Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Bobik T.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 137-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is most clearly seen with many of the methyltransferases, where aerobic and anaerobic homologues exist for the enzymes that methylate at C20 (CobI and CbiL) (Fig. 1c), C17 (CobJ and CbiH), C11 (CobM and CbiF), and C5 (CobL and CbiE) (6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the majority of the methyltransferases associated with cobalamin biosynthesis share sequence similarity, indicating that they are all derived from a common ancestor (6Roth J.R. Lawrence J.G. Rubenfield M. Kieffer-Higgins S. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3303-3316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Raux E. Schubert H.L. Roper J.M. Wilson S.W. Warren M.J. Bioorganic Chem. 1999; 27: 100-118Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A study of these methyltransferases will not only provide some significant insight into how regio-specificity can be acquired within a common protein framework but also provide molecular detail on how these enzymes discriminate between metal-free and cobalt-containing substrates, which is one of the major differences between the two pathways. In this paper, we look at the structure and function of the Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus CbiL. We determine the nature of the true substrate for the enzyme and elucidate the structure of CbiL. From this we have been able to provide experimental evidence for how the substrates bind to the enzyme, how it recognizes cobalt-containing substrates, and how it forms a productive ternary complex.

The gene was subsequently subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET14b and pETac vectors. For in vivo activity analysis, CbiL was subcloned into pETac, a vector that is similar to pET14b but instead of the T7 promoter contains a lac promoter. The CbiL mutants D104A, K176A, and Y220A were generated using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For protein overproduction, Escherichia coli strain Rosetta(DE3)pLysS was transformed with pET14b Mth cbiL. The recombinant strain was grown in super Luria-Bertani broth with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C and shaken vigorously to an A600 of ∼0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 16 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 5 mm imidazole. Cells were lysed, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. CbiL was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The bound protein was isolated by competitive elution with increasing concentrations of imidazole and finally eluted in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 400 mm imidazole. Substrate Synthesis—CbiL substrates were synthesized by multienzyme synthesis (13Raux E. Leech H.K. Beck R. Schubert H.L. Santander P.J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Martens J.H. Jahn D. Thermes C. Rambach A. Warren M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 505-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under nitrogen containing less than 3 ppm oxygen in an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology). E. coli constructs overexpressing the genes 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase (M. thermautotrophicus hemB), porphobilinogen deaminase (Bacillus megaterium hemC), uroporphyrinogen III synthase (B. megaterium hemD), SUMT (Pseudomonas denitrificans cobA), precorrin-2 dehydrogenase (B. megaterium sirC), and cobalt chelatase (M. thermautotrophicus cbiX) were overproduced separately and lysed. For factor II production, cell-free lysates of HemB (10 mg), HemC, HemD, CobA, and SirC (5 mg) were pooled with 20 mg of SAM, 13 mg of NAD+, and 10 mg of the starter molecule ALA in a total volume of 40 ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Oxygen was removed by repeatedly freeze-thawing the reaction mix in liquid nitrogen under a strong vacuum. The sample was transferred into the glove box and incubated overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was filtered (0.2 μm; Millipore) prior to incubation with affinity-purified CbiX (7.5 mg) and CoCl2 (200 μm). Alternatively, to obtain highly concentrated cobalt factor II for EPR analysis and crystal soaking experiments, a single plasmid, pETcoco-2ABCDC, carrying the genes M. thermautotrophicus hemB and sirC, B. megaterium hemC and hemD, and Methanosarcina barkeri cobA was overexpressed. Lysate of the E. coli strain carrying the plasmid was purified (nickel-chelating Sepharose), and the most concentrated protein fraction was transferred into the glove box. Following buffer exchange of the protein into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 3 ml of the protein was pooled with 2 ml of cofactor mix consisting of 20 mg/ml SAM, 6.5 mg/ml NAD, and 10 mg/ml ALA in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The cofactor mix was adjusted to pH 8.0 with 2 m NaOH prior to use. The reaction was incubated overnight at room temperature. Cobalt factor II was produced as described above by the addition of M. thermautotrophicus CbiX and CoCl2, depending on the factor II concentration. Cobalt factor II was DEAE-purified prior to use. In Vitro Activity Assay—The C20 methyltransferase assay used cobalt factor II (5.6 μm), SAM (950 μm), and varying amounts of wild type CbiL and mutant variants. The disappearance of cobalt factor II at λmax 386 nm was monitored using a Hewlett Packard 8452A photodiode array spectrophotometer. The concentration of cobalt factor II was determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.6 × 105 m–1 cm–1. In Vivo Activity Assay—An S. enterica cbiL mutant strain (AR3711) was transformed with a plasmid containing wild type cbiL (pSF26) and the three cbiL mutant plasmids pSF27, pSF28, and pSF29. The negative control contained pETac, the positive control S. enterica cbiL (pAR8547). Transformations were spread on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. A few colonies were picked from each plate and transferred to agar analytic plates (14Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If the S. enterica cbiL mutant strain reacquired the ability to produce cobalamin, the colony developed a red color. Crystallization of CbiL—After purification, CbiL was desalted using Sephadex 25, and the His tag was cleaved by incubating overnight with thrombin at 4 °C. The protein was subsequently gel-filtered (Superdex™ 200 HR 10/30; Amersham Biosciences) into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl before concentration to 2.5 mg ml–1 for crystallization. Hanging drop vapor equilibration trials using reservoirs containing 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, and 2.5 m ammonium sulfate and protein drops comprising equal volumes of CbiL with 3.3 mm SAM and reservoir produced clusters of needle crystals. Two heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking native CbiL crystals in reservoir supplemented with mercury chloride (MeHgCl) and samarium chloride (SmCl3), respectively (see Table 2 for soak details). The diffraction quality was not affected by the inclusion of cryoprotectant, 10% (v/v) glycerol, in the soak solutions, and previtrified crystals were transported to the synchrotron. Native data were initially collected using PX 9.6 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source (Daresbury, UK). The two heavy metal derivative data sets and high resolution native data were collected at station ID 14-3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Table 2).TABLE 2X-ray data and refinement statisticsCrystalNativeMeHgClSmCl3Soak concentrationNone1 mm50 mmSoak time (h)None0.53Cell edges: a = b, c (Å)135.92, 50.37135.74, 50.26135.99, 50.29Resolution range (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.50.38 to 2.21 (2.21 to 2.10)58.82 to 2.33 (2.45 to 2.33)58.93 to 2.50 (2.64 to 2.5)〈I/σ(I)〉aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.18.6 (4.8)18.5 (3.3)24.2 (6.9)MultiplicityaValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.7.5 (7.2)7.0 (3.6)9.1 (7.2)Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.100 (100)97.1 (80.3)100 (100)Midslope anomalous probability1.3261.245Phasing power (acentric)1.181.04Rcullis (acentric)0.820.85RmergeaValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.0.074 (0.363)0.076 (0.308)0.068 (0.249)Root mean square bond distance (Å)aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.Average σ0.017 (0.022)Root mean square angle (degrees)aValues in parentheses are for the outer shell.Average σ1.753 (1.993)R-factor19.2Free R-factor27.0Average B-factors (Å2)Main chain32.7Side chains38.1All atoms35.6Validation PROCHECK438 waters 3980 total atoms in fileG-factor-0.03Ramachandran plot (favored/allowed/generously allowed) (%)93.5/6.3/0.3a Values in parentheses are for the outer shell. Open table in a new tab Substrate Soaking into Native CbiL Crystals—Cobalt factor II was prepared as described above. The solution was passed through a cobalt-loaded ion affinity chromatography resin to remove the biosynthetic enzymes and eluted in 6 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with a concentration of 170 μm. After freeze-drying, the substrate was resuspended in mother liquor consisting of 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 2.47 m ammonium sulfate and 10% glycerol (v/v). A drop (8 μl) of substrate was placed on the same coverslip as the target crystal, and the crystal was transferred into the substrate solution. The coverslip was quickly placed back onto the well to control the crystallization of ammonium sulfate. The crystals were soaked for 10 min in close to saturating concentrations of tetrapyrrole substrate and then harvested onto a loop and vitrified immediately in liquid nitrogen. All steps, including crystal growth, substrate preparation, crystal soaks, and cryocooling, were under anaerobic conditions. Data were collected from seven tetrapyrrole-soaked crystals, some of which became colored upon soaking. The majority of the crystals diffracted to around 2.0 Å resolution, the best 1.8 and worst 3.0 Å. Additional density could be detected in σA-weighted 2Fo–Fc Fourier syntheses for three of the seven soaks, although the density was low, reflecting low occupancy and multiple binding modes. Cobalt factor II was translated and rotated into the electron density present in the initial maps in what appears to be the principal binding mode in the crystal. Structure Determination and Refinement—Diffraction data were processed using MOSLFM (15Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1992; 26Google Scholar), SCALA, and the CCP4 program suite (16Collaborative Computational Project N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Fourteen cycles of refinement and rebuilding using REFMAC5 (20Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). HPLC-Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectroscopic data were obtained on an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography system connected to an Agilent 1100 liquid chromatography/MSD Trap, using the electrospray ionization technique in the positive mode. Spectra were monitored by DAD-UV detection. Samples of cobalt factor II and cobalt factor III were prepared in the glove box, filtered (0.2 mm; Millipore), and transferred into HPLC vials with air-tight seals. Routinely, 100 μl of sample was injected into a BDS HYPERSIL C18 column (dimensions, 250 × 4.6 mm; particle size, 5 μm) and eluted with a gradient of 50% of 1 m ammonium acetate containing 9% acetonitrile and 50% double-distilled H2O increasing within 5 min to 100% of 1 m ammonium acetate containing 9% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. EPR—EPR samples of cobalt factor II and cobalt factor III were prepared using the multienzyme approach in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. The compounds were DEAE-purified. Aerobic samples of these two compounds were prepared anaerobically but removed from the glove box and exposed to air before freezing in liquid nitrogen. EPR samples of cobalt factor II incubated with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) and CbiL or SAH and the mutants D104A, K176A, and Y220A were also prepared. Factor II was prepared in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl using the single plasmid method. Subsequently, cobalt factor II was produced, purified, and concentrated on a DEAE column. CbiL and the three CbiL mutants were purified, the His tag was cleaved, and they were transferred into the glove box and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. EPR samples were made anaerobically in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, with final concentrations of 60 μm for cobalt factor II and CbiL, respectively, and 780 μm SAH. EPR spectra were obtained at X-band using a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR900 liquid helium cryostat. The run conditions for the EPR measurements were as follows: temperature 20 K, microwave power 0.5 milliwatts, modulation amplitude 0.5 milliteslas. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—The thermodynamics of SAM and SAH binding to CbiL were determined using an isothermal titration microcalorimeter (VP-ITC MicroCal™). SAM or SAH was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl. Prior to the experiment, samples were degassed under vacuum for 5 min. The sample cell was filled with the protein (200 μm). Initially, titrations with the cofactors consisted of a one-time injection of 2 and 5 μl for SAM and SAH, respectively. This was followed by 59 5-μl and 29 10-μl injections for SAM and SAH, respectively. All runs were at 30 °C. Heat release was monitored for each injection peak and analyzed using the Microcal Origin software, a data analysis and graphics software. The integrated heat was plotted against the molar ratio of SAM or SAH added to CbiL in the cell. A complete binding isotherm for the interaction was obtained. The one-site model was used to fit the data as implemented by the Microcal Origin software based on the Wiseman isotherm (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The values for stoichiometry, dissociation constant (KD), and enthalpy (ΔH), were determined. The M. thermautotrophicus cbiL Encodes a Cobalt Factor II Methyltransferase—The M. thermautotrophicus cbiL was amplified by PCR from genomic M. thermautotrophicus DNA (24Smith D.R. Doucette-Stamm L.A. Deloughery C. Lee H. Dubois J. Aldredge T. Bashirzadeh R. Blakely D. Cook R. Gilbert K. Harrison D. Hoang L. Keagle P. Lumm W. Pothier B. Qiu D. Spadafora R. Vicaire R. Wang Y.

Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7135-7155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), and the 714-bp product was cloned into pET14b, thereby allowing the encoded protein to be produced with an N-terminal histidine-rich peptide extension. The fidelity of the cloning procedure was confirmed by sequencing. In order to probe the physiological activity of the His-tagged CbiL, the fused gene was subcloned into the plasmid pET-ac, which is a pET plasmid derivative under the control of a tac promoter (instead of the T7 promoter). The tac promoter allows expression in strains that do not contain a T7 RNA polymerase. The S. enterica cbiL mutant strain (AR3711) was transformed with pETac-cbiL, pETac (negative control) and pAR8547 (positive control, which harbors the S. enterica cbiL). Colonies were restreaked on minimal medium plates containing propanediol and a pH-sensitive indicator (14Raux E. Lanois A. Levillayer F. Warren M.J. Brody E. Rambach A. Thermes C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 753-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). If cobalamin is made by the bacteria, they are able to convert the propanediol to propionic acid using their B12-dependent diol dehydratase. The production of the acid turns the indicator red and results in the appearance of red colonies on the plate. Both pAR8547 and pETac-cbiL were found to complement the S. enterica cbiL mutant and generate red colonies, whereas the negative control (pETac) colonies remained white, indicating that they were unable to produce cobalamin. This result demonstrates not only that the function ascribed to M. thermautotrophicus cbiL was correct but moreover that the His-tagged"
https://openalex.org/W1988598662,"Rho-dependent transcription termination is an essential process for the regulation of bacterial gene expression. Thus far, only two Rho-specific inhibitors of bacterial transcription termination have been described, the psu protein from the satellite bacteriophage P4 and YaeO from Escherichia coli. Here, we report the solution structure of YaeO, the first of a Rho-specific inhibitor of transcription termination. YaeO is an acidic protein composed of an N-terminal helix and a seven-stranded β sandwich. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments revealed that YaeO binds proximal to the primary nucleic acid binding site of Rho. Based on the NMR titrations, a docked model of the YaeO-Rho complex was calculated. These results suggest that YaeO binds outside the Rho hexamer, acting as a competitive inhibitor of RNA binding. In vitro gel shift assays confirmed the inhibition of nucleic acid binding to Rho. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the negative character of YaeO is essential for its function in vivo.

Transcription termination is the process by which a nascent RNA is released from its complex with RNA polymerase and DNA template. In bacteria, two main mechanisms of transcription termination have been described. These mechanisms, commonly referred to as Rho-independent and Rho-dependent termination, are essential for the regulation of bacterial gene expression (1Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1996; (Neidhardt, F. C., ed) pp. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.: 822-848Google Scholar). Rho-independent termination occurs at a GC-rich self-complementarity region that forms a stem-loop structure believed to cause the RNA polymerase to pause, allowing the release of the RNA (2Brendel V. Hamm G.H. Trifonov E.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1986; 3: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Rosenberg M. Court D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1979; 13: 319-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Rho-dependent termination, on the other hand, requires the presence of a hexameric helicase, Rho (4Brown S. Brickman E.R. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 422-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho is an essential transcription factor that binds nucleic acids at specific termination sites (rut) and translocates along the RNA until it reaches the transcription complex (6Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Platt T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 983-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 8Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1251-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). There, it facilitates termination by unwinding RNA/DNA heteroduplexes upon hydrolysis of ATP (9Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Currently, only two Rho-specific inhibitors of transcription termination have been reported. The first to be described is a 21.3-kDa protein encoded by gene psu of the satellite bacteriophage P4 (10Linderoth N.A. Calendar R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6722-6731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Psu interferes with transcription in phage, plasmid, and bacterial operons, and its activity does not depend on sequences in the transcript. In vitro, protein Psu causes efficient readthrough of Rho-dependent terminators λ tR1 and TIS2 in a manner that seems to be insensitive to NusG (11Linderoth N.A. Tang G. Calendar R. Virology. 1997; 227: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Whether Psu inhibits an enzymatic activity of Rho or the interaction of Rho with RNA, ATP, NusG, or RNA polymerase is unknown. NusG is a transcriptional elongation factor that interacts with both Rho and RNA polymerase (12Pasman Z. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5573-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Li J. Mason S.W. Greenblatt J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The second inhibitor is the product of gene yaeO from Escherichia coli, which has been shown to reduce termination in the Rho-dependent bacteriophage terminator tL1 and upstream the autogenously regulated gene rho (14Pichoff S. Alibaud L. Guédant A. Castanié M.P. Bouché J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Overexpression of YaeO can cause the pleiotropic suppression of conditional lethal mutations in division and heat shock genes such as ftsQ, ftsA, grpE, groEL, and groES (14Pichoff S. Alibaud L. Guédant A. Castanié M.P. Bouché J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). YaeO is a 9-kDa acidic protein that binds tightly to Rho, but the exact nature of this interaction was unknown (14Pichoff S. Alibaud L. Guédant A. Castanié M.P. Bouché J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, the solution structure of YaeO is reported, the first of a Rho-specific inhibitor of transcription termination. Additionally, the binding surface of the Rho-YaeO complex was mapped for both proteins and a docked model calculated. Finally, the effect of some YaeO mutants on Rho-dependent transcription termination was tested in vivo and a mechanism for YaeO-mediated regulation proposed. Sample Preparation—The gene yaeO from E. coli K12 was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) and expressed in E. coli BL21 as an oligo-histidine (His tag) fusion protein of 106 residues. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Afterward, the temperature was reduced to 30 °C and the cells were allowed to express the protein for 3 h before harvesting. The media used were either Luria Bertani or M9 minimal medium containing [15N] ammonium chloride and/or [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA). YaeO was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-loaded chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). NMR samples were ∼2 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate buffer 1 mm NaN3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.0. Full-length Rho and the amino-terminal domain of Rho, residues 1–130 (Rho130), were cloned, expressed, and purified in a similar fashion. For simplicity in the text, residues in YaeO and Rho are numbered according to the wild-type protein sequences. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were recorded at 303 K on a Bruker Avance 600 MHz spectrometer. Backbone and side-chain assignments of YaeO were determined using HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, 15N-edited TOCSY, and 13C-edited TOCSY. Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) 2The abbreviations used are: NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; r.m.s., root mean square. data for the structure determination were obtained from homonuclear NOESY, 15N-edited or 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY experiments. Evaluation of spectra and manual assignments was completed with XEASY (15Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuöthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). IPAP-HSQC experiments for measuring 15N-1H dipolar couplings were recorded on an isotropic medium and a sample containing 18 mg/ml Pf1 phage (16Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 17Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). 15N{1H}-heteronuclear NOE data were measured by taking the ratio of peak intensities from experiments performed with and without 1H presaturation. Hydrogen bond constraints were introduced to secondary structure regions as determined by chemical shift analysis and characteristic NOE patterns. ϕ and Ψ dihedral restraints were obtained using the TALOS program (18Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were processed using either XWINNMR version 2.5 or 3.1 (Bruker Biospin) or GIFA (19Malliavin T.E. Pons J.L. Delsuc M.A. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Evaluation of spectra and manual assignments was completed with XEASY (15Bartels C. Xia T. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuöthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). Analysis and Structure Calculations—CNS 1.1 software (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54 (, Pt. 5,): 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) was used to generate an initial fold of YaeO with a basic set of manually assigned NOEs obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and two-dimensional homonuclear NOE spectra and dihedral angle and hydrogen bond constraints (21Wuöthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. 1986; (, Wiley & Sons, New York)Google Scholar). These calculations generated a fold that was used as a model template for automated assignments by ARIA 1.1 (22Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The final structure of YaeO was calculated using the constraints in Table 1 and collected from the experiments described above. In the final round of calculations, CNS 1.1 was extended to incorporate residual dipolar coupling restraints (RDCs) for further refinement. The axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor were defined from a histogram of measured RDCs (23Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and optimized by a grid search method (24Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Twenty structures were selected based on the lowest overall energy and least violations to represent final structures. PROCHECK-NMR was used to generate Ramachandran plots to check the stereochemical geometry of the protein (25Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The protein sample and stock solutions of the ligands were all prepared for NMR as described in sample preparation. Docking—Docking of YaeO and Rho130 was done using HADDOCK (26Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Ambiguous interaction restraints were defined for residues at least 50% solvent-exposed and with chemical shift perturbations above the average. Mobile regions were determined based on heteronuclear NOE data. 200 structures were calculated during the first step of rigid body energy minimization followed by 50 structures of semirigid simulated annealing in torsion angle space. The best model was selected based on the convergence of the structures at the interface and intermolecular energy. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For site-directed mutagenesis, plasmid pSEB41 was used as a template. Acidic residues from YaeO thought to be involved in the interaction with Rho were mutated to lysine using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. β-Galactosidase Assays—Strains JS219/pJPB314 (lacZp) and JS219/pJPB314/pSEB41 (lacZp-yaeO) were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 2% glucose. Cultures were maintained below A600 = 1 by dilution. Strain JS219/pJPB314 was also transformed with plasmid pSEB41 containing D14K, E40K, or E73K mutations. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described by Miller (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. 1972; (Miller, J. H., ed) pp. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY: 352-355Google Scholar). Strains and plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. J-P. Bouché (CNRS, Toulouse Cédex, France). Electromobility Gel Shift Assays—Assays of nucleic acid binding to full-length Rho were carried out as described in Ref. 28Pani B. Banerjee S. Chalissery J. Abishek M. Loganathan R.M. Suganthan R.B.

Chemically synthesized oligo(dC)34 was 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and mixed with the indicated proteins in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl, and 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min before electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel with 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris base, 44 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA) and autoradiography. Structure Determination of YaeO—YaeO was produced in E. coli as an N-terminal His tag fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. The His tag was not removed for structural studies as its presence did not perturb the structure of the protein, as evidenced by comparison of 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of the cleaved and uncleaved protein. The protein was labeled uniformly with 15N or with 15N and 13C for NMR analysis. Backbone resonance assignments were obtained with standard triple resonance NMR experiments. The overall structure of YaeO is well defined by the NMR data, except for residues 1–8 and 84–86, which are not structured. These residues have almost no long-range NOEs and show {1H}-15N NOEs close to zero, which is indicative of high mobility in solution (supplemental Fig. S1). From secondary chemical shift analysis, we deduced that YaeO is composed of one α helix and a seven-stranded β-sandwich. The location of secondary structure elements relative to the primary sequence reveals that helix α1 is the best conserved secondary structure element (Fig. 1). Variations exist in the β3–β4 and β6–β7 loops, possibly reflecting differences in their function. Highly conserved residues cluster at helix α1 or form the hydrophobic core of YaeO. Residues Cys-12, Asp-16, Glu-19, Cys-22, and Glu-52 are completely conserved. The side chains of these residues are located in the exposed surface of YaeO, suggesting that their conservation might reflect their biological function. Fig. 1 shows a stereo superposition of the ten lowest energy NMR structures. The helical region comprises residues 14–23. The two faces of the sandwich are formed by antiparallel β strands β2/β1/β6/β7 and β3/β4/β5, respectively. β strands 1–7 comprise residues 26–32, 36–42, 44–48, 51–58, 61–65, 71–75, and 79–83. Multiple non-polar residues pack between both strands to form a structural core, which includes Leu-28, Leu-30, Leu-54, Val-56, Ile-70, Phe-73, Ile-78, and Val-81. The folded regions of YaeO have root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations of 0.53 Å for backbone atoms and 1.08 Å for all heavy atoms (Table 1). The electrostatic surface representation of YaeO shows that α1 together with β1, β6, and β7 forms a highly negatively charged patch due to residues Asp-13, Asp-16, Glu-19 and Glu-31. Comparative Analysis of YaeO—YaeO appears to be a member of a family of inhibitors of Rho-dependent transcription termination. YaeO-related proteins are present in several species of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria with a high degree of sequence relatedness, indicating a widespread and conserved function. Structure-based searches of the Protein Data Bank with the program DALI revealed 12 similar structures with a Z-score larger than 2.0. The most prominent of these are the pleiotropic translational regulator Hfq (1QK1, supplemental Fig. S2), the heptameric archaeal Sm protein (1I8F), the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sm d3 fragment (1D3B), and the small ribonucleoprotein sm (1OU8). Z-scores were 4.4, 3.7, 3.3, and 3.0, respectively, with r.m.s. deviations ranging from 2.7 to 3.3 Å for matching Cα atoms. These results reveal that, despite the lack of recognizable sequence similarity, the fold of YaeO is topologically similar to that of the RNA binding domain of small ribonucleoproteins (Sm-fold). The most important difference between the Sm-fold and YaeO is the presence of an additional β-strand (β7) in YaeO. It is important to note that, even though most of the hits are transcriptional regulators or involved in mRNA processing, titrations with single-stranded DNA performed on YaeO did not reveal any observable interaction (data not shown). Interactions between YaeO and Rho—To understand the mechanism of transcription termination inhibition by YaeO, NMR experiments were performed to observe the interaction of YaeO with Rho in vitro. For this, a truncated version of Rho, Rho130, from E. coli was constructed. This fragment corresponds to the primary RNA binding site of Rho (residues 1–130) and has been shown to be a good model of Rho-oligonucleotide interactions (29Briercheck D.M. Wood T.C. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We performed an NMR titration by recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled YaeO as a function of unlabeled Rho130 concentration. Complex formation occurred, as evidenced by fast exchange chemical shift perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the bound and free spectra allowed us to map the binding site of Rho on YaeO (Fig. 2, B and C). The largest chemical shifts occurred in the N and C termini, helix α1 and strands β3, β4, β5, and β7. These regions localize to one edge of the β-sandwich with clustered acidic residues. These results suggest that the unfolded N and C termini of YaeO become structured upon binding to Rho. As the structure of Rho130 has been solved by NMR (29Briercheck D.M. Wood T.C. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Rule G.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we decided to map the interaction with YaeO on Rho130 (Fig. 2D). Rho130 was uniformly 15N-labeled and the 1H-15N HSQC peaks were assigned using the chemical shifts for the previously determined NMR structure, kindly provided by Dr. G. Rule (30Briercheck D.M. Allison T.J. Richardson J.P. Ellena J.F. Wood T.C. Rule G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 429-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rho130 is composed of an α-helical (residues 1–47) and a β-sheet subdomain (residues 48–130). Chemical shift perturbation analysis showed that YaeO binds primarily to strands β3, β4, β5 and helix 4 of the β-sheet subdomain (Fig. 2E). Minor shifts were also observed for helix 3 and strands 1 and 2. Structural evidence has shown that RNA binds to the N-terminal domain of Rho mainly by contacts with Phe-64, Arg-66, Glu-78, Tyr-80, Arg-88, Phe-89, Glu-108, and Tyr-110 (31Skordalakes E. Berger J.M.

Cell. 2006; 127: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These residues are neighbors of the YaeO-interacting region of Rho, suggesting a mechanism of transcription termination inhibition by blocking the RNA binding site on Rho (Fig. 2F). Model of the Rho-YaeO Complex—As NMR titration data for the YaeO-Rho interaction were available for both proteins, a model of the complex was built using high ambiguity-driven protein docking (HADDOCK) (26Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). Ambiguous interaction restraints were derived from the NMR titration data by selecting residues with both the biggest chemical shifts and solvent accessibility. Unfolded residues were allowed to move freely during the docking protocol. The model with the lowest intermolecular energy after the last stage of refinement in Cartesian space with explicit solvent was selected. The interaction between YaeO and Rho seems to be facilitated by charge complementarity and burial of ∼2558 Å2 of surface area. This is consistent with in vitro binding results that show the YaeO-Rho interaction is salt-dependent and can be disrupted at high ionic strengths (0.4 m KCl) (14Pichoff S. Alibaud L. Guédant A. Castanié M.P. Bouché J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The docking model suggests six potential salt bridges: Asp-5:Arg-87, Asp-44:Lys-100, Asp-44: Lys-115, Glu-52:Arg-88, Glu-57:Arg-102, and Glu-64:Lys-105. The model is compatible with the hexameric structure Rho as there are no clashes when the YaeO-Rho130 model is superposed to the hexameric, open ring structure of Rho (Fig. 3). YaeO binding overlaps with the predicted path of RNA when bound to Rho and is expected to inhibit binding. YaeO Inhibition of Nucleic Acid Binding by Rho—To test this prediction, we carried out electromobility gel shift assays with oligo(dC)34 and Rho in the presence and absence of YaeO. The binding of poly(dC) by hexameric Rho is competitive with the binding of poly(rC) (34Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Addition of 5 μm YaeO blocked approximately half of complex formation at two different concentrations of Rho (supplemental Fig. S3). At a 10-fold excess of YaeO to Rho, single-stranded DNA binding was completely blocked. Mutagenesis of the Rho Binding Site—The model of YaeO bound to Rho reflects the electrostatic complementarity of the two protein surfaces. To test the importance of the expected salt bridges, three YaeO mutants, D14K, E19K, and E52K, were constructed. The effects of these charge-reversal mutations were tested in the gel shift assay. All three mutations prevented the inhibition of nucleic acid binding to Rho (Fig. 4A). The structural integrity and proper folding of the mutant proteins were verified by NMR (supplemental Fig. S4). The mutants were also tested in vivo using a β-galactosidase reporter system developed by Pichoff et al. (14Pichoff S. Alibaud L. Guédant A. Castanié M.P. Bouché J.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this system, the expression of β-galactosidase is under the control of a Rho binding sequence upstream of the coding region. Expression of YaeO inhibits Rho, allowing the production of high levels of β-galactosidase. The three mutants tested showed β-galactosidase levels similar to the negative control, indicating that the acidic residues are required for YaeO inhibition of Rho activity. Our data demonstrate that YaeO binds to the transcription factor Rho and provide a structural basis for its inhibition of transcription termination. It is likely that YaeO binds to the Rho hexamer in a 1:1 monomer-to-monomer ratio. Gel shift assays show that YaeO reduces the affinity of Rho for nucleic acids with an approximate in vitro KI for YaeO of 5 μm. Previous studies have suggested that the pathway of RNA binding to hexameric Rho consist of four steps: PR1, PR2, PR3, and PR4 (35Kim D.E. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13902-13910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). State PR1 is formed when the RNA binds to the primary binding site of Rho. Bound RNA then fills the continuous binding sites in the crown to form PR2. The third step consists of the opening of the ring, leading to passage of the RNA through the central channel to form PR3. Finally, PR4 is formed when the ring closes, rendering Rho competent in ATPase and translocation activities. Our data suggest that the YaeO acts by inhibiting the formation of the PR1 and/or PR2 states. Rho is unique to prokaryotes and essential for the viability of many bacterial species; as a consequence it is an attractive target for drug development. The use of antibiotics targeting Rho dates from the isolation of bicyclomycin (Bicozamycin, BCM) in 1972 from Streptomyces sapporonensis and Streptomyces aizumenses (36Kamiya T. Maeno S. Hashimoto M. Mine Y. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1972; 25: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Miyamura S. Ogasawara N. Otsuka H. Niwayama S. Tanaka H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1972; 25: 610-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BCM possess antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria such as E. coli, Shigella, and Salmonella and Gram-positives such as Micrococcus luteus (38Magyar A. Zhang X. Kohn H. Widger W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25369-25374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The inhibitory mechanism of YaeO is different from that of BCM, as the latter binds to the C-terminal domain of Rho (39Skordalakes E. Brogan A.P. Park B.S. Kohn H. Berger J.M. Structure. 2005; 13: 99-109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The knowledge of the structure of YaeO and its binding site on Rho opens a new possibility for the rational design of antibiotics targeting Rho. YaeO mimetics offer the possibility of a novel class of antibacterial compounds that block the initial steps in the association of Rho with RNA. We thank Gordon S. Rule (Dept. of Biological Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA) for kindly providing the chemical shifts of Rho130 and Jean-Pierre Bouché for providing the strains for the in vivo YaeO assay.

https://openalex.org/W2088677650,"Strategies for non-invasive and quantitative imaging of gene expression in vivo have been developed over the past decade. Non-invasive assessment of the dynamics of gene regulation is of interest for the detection of endogenous disease-specific biological alterations (e.g., signal transduction) and for monitoring the induction and regulation of therapeutic genes (e.g., gene therapy). To demonstrate that non-invasive imaging of regulated expression of any type of gene after in vivo transduction by versatile vectors is feasible, we generated regulatable herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors carrying hormone (mifepristone) or antibiotic (tetracycline) regulated promoters driving the proportional co-expression of two marker genes. Regulated gene expression was monitored by fluorescence microscopy in culture and by positron emission tomography (PET) or bioluminescence (BLI) in vivo. The induction levels evaluated in glioma models varied depending on the dose of inductor. With fluorescence microscopy and BLI being the tools for assessing gene expression in culture and animal models, and with PET being the technology for possible application in humans, the generated vectors may serve to non-invasively monitor the dynamics of any gene of interest which is proportionally co-expressed with the respective imaging marker gene in research applications aiming towards translation into clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W2048103092,"EUDOC is a docking program that has successfully predicted small-molecule-bound protein complexes and identified drug leads from chemical databases. To expand the application of the EUDOC program to supramolecular chemistry, we tested its ability to reproduce crystal structures of small-molecule complexes. Of 161 selected crystal structures of small-molecule guest-host complexes, EUDOC reproduced all these crystal structures with guest structure mass-weighted root mean square deviations (mwRMSDs) of <1.0 Å relative to the corresponding crystal structures. In addition, the average interaction energy of these 161 guest-host complexes (−50.1 kcal/mol) was found to be nearly half of that of 153 previously tested small-molecule-bound protein complexes (−108.5 kcal/mol), according to the interaction energies calculated by EUDOC. 31 of the 161 complexes could not be reproduced with mwRMSDs of <1.0 Å if neighboring hosts in the crystal structure of a guest-host complex were not included as part of the multimeric host system, whereas two of the 161 complexes could not be reproduced with mwRMSDs of <1.0 Å if water molecules were excluded from the host system. These results demonstrate the significant influence of crystal packing on small molecule complexation and suggest that EUDOC is able to predict small-molecule complexes and that it is useful for the design of new materials, molecular sensors, and multimeric inhibitors of protein-protein interactions."

Sequence comparisons of RNA m5C methyltransferases indicate that the eukaryotic enzymes possess, in addition to a conserved catalytic domain, a large characteristic carboxyl-terminal extension. To gain insight into the function of this additional domain, the modular architecture of the yeast tRNA m5C methyltransferase orthologue, Trm4p, was studied. The yeast enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to carbon 5 of cytosine at different positions depending on the tRNAs. By limited proteolysis, Trm4p was shown to be composed of two domains that have been separately produced and purified. Here we demonstrate that the aminoterminal domain, encompassing the active site, binds tRNA with similar affinity as the whole enzyme but shows low catalytic efficiency. The carboxyl-terminal domain displays only weak affinity for tRNA. It is not required for m5C formation and does not appear to contribute to substrate specificity.

Transfer RNAs present the largest variety of chemical modifications and the highest degree of modification among all RNA species. Modifications at position 34 of the anticodon or 37, 3′ to the anticodon, are important for fidelity during decoding of genetic information. The function of most of the modifications outside the anticodon loop remains to be characterized. Yet some of these modifications have been shown to play a role in the stabilization of the tRNA tertiary structure, the correct folding of tRNA, and the specific recognition of tRNAs by the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases or translation factors (1Agris P.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 79-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA. 1998; (, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

The methylations at different base positions and at the 2′-hydroxyl group of ribose are the most frequently encountered modifications in all RNAs. Among them, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) 5The abbreviations used are: m5C, 5-methylcytosine; AdoMet, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; MTase, methyltransferase; Trm4p, yeast tRNA m5C methyltransferase; NTrm4p, amino-terminal domain of yeast tRNA m5C methyltransferase; CTrm4p, carboxyl-terminal domain of yeast tRNA m5C methyltransferase. is found in tRNAs of eukaryotic and archaeal organisms but not in eubacteria. By increasing the hydrophobicity of the nucleoside and thus its propensity for base stacking, methylation of cytosine at C5 helps to stabilize the nucleic acid structure (1Agris P.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 53: 79-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Basti M.M. Stuart J.W. Lam A.T. Guenther R. Agris P.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its formation is catalyzed by a multisite-specific tRNA m5C methyltransferase (MTase), Trm4p, that uses S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) as methyl donor. Depending on the tRNA substrate, the target cytosines are located at positions 34, 40, 48, and/or 49 (6Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Google Scholar). Most tRNAs are modified at positions 48 and/or 49, whereas methylations at positions 34 and 40, present only in tRNALeu and tRNAPhe, respectively, occur exclusively in intron-containing tRNA precursors.

A major characteristic of the eukaryotic RNA m5C MTases is the presence of a polypeptide chain extension appended to the carboxyl terminus of the protein (7Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The carboxyl-terminal extension of Trm4p is unrelated to known RNA-binding domains or any other domain with known function according to a BLAST similarity search. The human orthologue of Trm4p was identified as the best match of a BLAST search in the human UniGene data base using Trm4p as a query, and its cDNA was expressed in a yeast strain deprived of the endogenous TRM4 gene (14Brzezicha B. Schmidt M. Makalowska I. Jarmolowski A. Pienkowska J. Szweykowska-Kulinska Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6034-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This human tRNA m5C MTase was shown to exhibit a much narrower specificity than Trm4p, because it catalyzes only the intron-dependent formation of m5C34 and not those of m5C48 and m5C49 in human or yeast tRNA substrates. This enzyme, also called Misu or NSun2, is a novel downstream target of the proto-oncogene myc, mediating the effects of Myc on cell growth and proliferation (15Frye M. Watt F.M. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 971-981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). It is overexpressed in different types of tumors and is a potential target for cancer therapies because the repression of its mRNA expression reduces tumor formation in vivo. The comparison of the human and yeast enzymes, which display close sequence similarities (supplemental Fig. S1) but target different cytosines in tRNAs, should help to better understand the relationship between amino acid sequence and substrate specificity. Although sequence analysis indicates the modular arrangement of the majority of RNA-modifying enzymes and identifies potential RNA-binding domains (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. J. Mol.

In this work, we have probed the modular architecture of yeast tRNA m5C MTase (Trm4p) by limited proteolysis. The coding sequences of the two identified structural domains were then cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to examine the role of the purified corresponding proteins in tRNA binding and catalytic activity and gain insight into the function of the carboxyl-terminal domain. Cloning of Trm4p Domains Coding Sequences—Recombinant versions of NTrm4p and CTrm4p were constructed with a His6 tag at their amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively. The open reading frames were amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the PCR primers AAAACCATGGGTCATCATCATCATCATCACATGGCTAGAAGAAAGAATTTCAAAAAAG (5′ primer) and AAAAGGATCCTCACTTTGTTTGAGGTCCTTCAGAC (3′ primer) for NTrm4p and AAAACCATGGGTAAAATAAAGGTAGAAGAAGTCCAAAAG (5′ primer) and AAAAGGATCCTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGATTAGCAGCGCTAGGAGC (3′ primer) for CTrm4p. The 5′ primers created the ATG start codon in the NcoI restriction site, and the 3′ primers introduce a BamHI restriction site immediately downstream from the TGA stop codon. The six histidine codons were introduced by the 5′ primer after the ATG start codon followed by a glycine codon for NTrm4p construct and by the 3′ primer immediately upstream from the TGA stop codon for CTrm4p. The amplified fragments were cut with NcoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and were cloned into the same sites in the expression vector pET11d (Novagen). Protein Overexpression and Purification—Trm4p was expressed and purified as described previously (11Walbott H. Husson C. Auxilien S. Golinelli-Pimpaneau B. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2007; 13: 967-973Google Scholar). NTrm4p and CTrm4p encoded by the recombinant plasmids were expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3)codon+ host strain (Novagen). The bacteria were grown in MM9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mm MgSO4, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures (1 liter) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8 and transferred at 20 °C, and expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thioga-lactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation. All purification steps were conducted at 4 °C. E. coli cells expressing the recombinant enzymes were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer A (0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture for use in purification of histidine-tagged proteins (Sigma), 50 mm sodium phosphate pH 8) supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A supplemented with 30 mm imidazole and eluted with buffer A supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. EDTA at a final concentration of 5 mm was added to the eluted protein fractions that were then dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol and stored at -80 °C. Trypsin Limited Proteolysis—Purified recombinant Trm4p (0.13 mg) was incubated in the presence of 0.1% (w/w) diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 0.125 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol. After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of the irreversible serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride at 4 mm final concentration (Pefabloc SC, Euromedex), and the sample was immediately analyzed using 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Amino-terminal Sequencing and Mass Spectrometry—Edman degradation of the polypeptide fragments resulting from limited proteolysis was performed by Diep Lê (LEBS, CNRS) using an ABI 407A automated sequencer. The samples were eluted from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) by semidry electrophoresis, and five sequencing cycles were performed. Mass spectrometry was performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager System 4080 by Christophe Marchand (Institut de Biochimie et Biophysique Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Paris XI). The samples were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, and mixed with sinapinic acid as a matrix. Preparation of RNA Substrates—Nonradiolabeled and [α-32P]CTP tRNA transcripts were obtained by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase of linearized plasmids and purification of the resulting transcripts on urea gels as described (21Grosjean H. Droogmans L. Giege R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Poly(C) RNA was bought from Roche Applied Science.

Measurement of tRNA Binding Affinity—The nitrocellulose-binding assay uses the preferential retention by nitrocellulose of proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes but not of free nucleic acids. The amount of radiolabeled tRNA complexed with protein in a solution is quantified by filtering through a nitrocellulose membrane and measuring the amount of retained radioactivity. The affinity of the different proteins for the mature yeast tRNAPhe transcript was measured in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm sinefungin (Sigma). After 20 min of incubation at 25 °C, each sample (20 μl) was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (type SM113 0.45 μm; Sartorius, Germany) that had been previously washed twice with 500 μl of buffer B at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed twice with 500 μl of buffer B at 4 °C and dried, and the retained radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. In Vitro tRNA m5C MTase Assays—Two different methods were used to determine the m5C MTase activity. The first approach used [α-32P]CTP-radiolabeled mature yeast tRNA transcripts. 200 nm of enzyme was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C with 60 μm AdoMet (Sigma), 1-2 nm [α-32P]CTP-tRNAPhe, 1 μm cold tRNAPhe in 50 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of phenol:chloroform:isoamylic alcohol (25:24:1), pH 4.5, to precipitate the protein. tRNA in the aqueous phase was extracted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, ethanol-precipitated, and then hydrolyzed to 5′-nucleoside monophosphates by nuclease P1 (ICN) overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3. Each hydrolysate was analyzed by two-dimensional chromatography on cellulose plates (Macherey-Nagel) as described (21Grosjean H. Droogmans L. Giege R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1050: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and the radioactivity in the spots was determined by exposing to a PhosphorImager screen and quantifying by ImageQuant software. The relative amount of m5C formed per tRNA molecule was determined by taking into account the total number of cytosines in the tRNA. The second assay, based on the methyl group incorporation from [3H]AdoMet (15 Ci/mmol; GE Healthcare) into nonradioactive RNA transcripts, was carried out in the same buffer and temperature conditions. Kinetics to determine the substrate specificity of NTrm4p compared with that of Trm4p were performed at 50 mm NaCl by incubating 400 nm of enzyme, 4 μm [3H]AdoMet, and 2 μm of various RNA. In all other tests, [3H]AdoMet was diluted 30 times with nonradioactive AdoMet. The salt dependence of the activities was analyzed by incubating 200 nm of enzyme, 60 μm AdoMet, and 10 μm total tRNA from the ΔYBL024w-disrupted yeast strain for 2 h. The kinetic parameters for the mature yeast tRNAPhe transcript were measured by varying the tRNAPhe concentration in the range of 0.125-8 μm at 50 mm NaCl or 0.0625-2 μm at 300 mm NaCl. 60 μm AdoMet was used, except in the case of NTrm4p where 80 μm AdoMet was used. The concentrations of Trm4p, NTrm4p:CTrm4p mixture, or NTrm4p were 600 nm, 1 μm, or 1.3 μm at 50 mm NaCl, respectively, and 40 nm for Trm4p or 200 nm for NTrm4p:CTrm4p at 300 mm NaCl. The samples were incubated for 2 or 1 h for Trm4p at 300 mm NaCl. After incubation, all the reactions were stopped by addition of cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, and the precipitates were collected by filtration through GF/C filters (Whatman). The filters were washed with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and dried, and the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Yeast tRNA m5C MTase Is Composed of Two Domains That Can Be Produced Separately—From the sequence comparison (7Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V.

Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 1609-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), these enzymes appear to be composed of a catalytic core domain and one or several additional domains (Fig. 1). In particular, yeast tRNA m5C MTase (Trm4p) is an 80-kDa protein that has been previously expressed in E. coli as an amino-terminally His-tagged protein (6Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Google Scholar). To probe its modular organization, the enzyme was subjected to limited trypsin proteolysis. With a 1:1000 trypsin:protein ratio, three main stable polypeptides were obtained after incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2B). The proteins were extracted from the gel, and their amino-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation and their mass by mass spectrometry. The band P1 corresponds to the amino-terminal domain of the protein without the histidine tag (NTrm4p, residues 1-437, 49.3 kDa), whereas the band P2 of similar mass is a truncated version of this domain where the first 22 amino acids are lacking (Fig. 2A). This is in agreement with protein modeling, predicting that these aminoterminal residues are at least partially disordered (8Bujnicki J.M. Feder M. Ayres C.L. Redman K.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2453-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The band P3 corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTrm4p, residues 438-684; 28.1 kDa; see Fig. 2A). To investigate the individual functional role played by the two domains, we cloned and expressed in E. coli the corresponding coding sequences with the addition of a His tag at the amino terminus for the two forms of the amino-terminal domain or at the carboxyl terminus for CTrm4p. The NTrm4p and CTrm4p domains, which were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, showed the expected apparent mass on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). The truncated amino-terminal domain displayed a 4-fold weaker binding affinity for tRNA and had a lower tRNA m5C MTase activity than NTrm4p (data not shown), indicating that the first 22 amino-terminal residues are involved at least in tRNA binding. Therefore, further study of the modular organization of Trm4p was done with the whole NTrm4p. NTrm4p Has Similar Affinity for tRNA as the Whole Enzyme whereas CTrm4p Displays Only Weak Affinity for tRNA—The apparent dissociation constants (Kd) for an unmodified mature yeast tRNAPhe transcript of the different proteins were determined using the nitrocellulose-binding assay (Table 1; Fig. 3). Because AdoMet binding has been shown to induce conformational changes in the catalytic domain of other AdoMet-dependent MTases (24Takata Y. Huang Y. Komoto J. Yamada T. Konishi K. Ogawa H. Gomi T. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8394-8402Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Scheuermann T.H. Keeler C. Hodsdon M.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12198-12209Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and because this could influence tRNA binding, the apparent dissociation constants were measured both in the presence or absence of the unreactive AdoMet substrate analogue sinefungin (Table 1). Clearly, the presence of sinefungin has no detectable effect on the Kd values, so we conclude that tRNA binding is probably not affected by a potential AdoMet-dependent conformational change of the enzyme. The apparent Kd value (30 nm) for tRNAPhe of NTrm4p is of the same order of magnitude as that of the whole enzyme, whereas CTrm4p is capable of binding tRNAPhe only with a 2.6 μm affinity, indicating that this isolated domain is obviously not an RNA-binding domain (Table 1 and Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the fact that the presence or absence of CTrm4p has apparently no effect on NTrm4p binding to the tRNA substrate.TABLE 1Dissociation constants of the various proteins for mature yeast tRNAPhe determined by the nitrocellulose-binding assay at 50 mmProteinKd−Sinefungin+SinefunginnMTrm4p70 ± 1063 ± 5NTrm4p30 ± 525 ± 3CTrm4p2560 ± 300NDaND indicates not determined.NTrm4p + CTrm4p29 ±339 ± 6a ND indicates not determined. Open table in a new tab NTrm4p Is Catalytically Active whereas CTrm4p Is Not—To test the tRNA MTase activity of the different proteins and verify that the product of methyl transfer is m5C, a mature yeast tRNAPhe transcript, which is potentially modified solely at position 49, in contrast to its intron-containing precursor which is methylated at both positions 40 and 49 (Fig. 4A) (6Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Google Scholar), was internally labeled with [α-32P]CTP, subjected to methylation, and hydrolyzed by nuclease P1. The resulting 5′-monophosphate nucleosides were then separated by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4B). Comparison of migration of the radioactivity to marker nucleosides shows that, after reaction with Trm4p, NTrm4p, or NTrm4p + CTrm4p, the transcript contains m5C but not in the case of CTrm4p. So CTrm4p alone does not catalyze m5C formation, as expected, whereas NTrm4p is surprisingly catalytically active per se. Determination of the ratio of radioactivity present in the m5CMP and CMP spots on the two-dimensional TLC indicates that Trm4p, NTrm4p, and a 1:1 mixture of NTrm4p and CTrm4p catalyze in 2 h the formation of 1.0, 0.4, or 0.7 mol of m5C per mol of tRNA, respectively. The enhancement of enzymatic activity by addition of CTrm4p to NTrm4p confirms the modular architecture of yeast tRNA m5C MTase and demonstrates that isolated CTrm4p is important for catalysis by NTrm4p. Trm4p and NTrm4p Show Different Activity Dependence on Salt Concentration—Before determining the steady-state kinetics parameters of the three active species, Trm4p, NTrm4p, and the 1:1 mixture of NTrm4p and CTrm4p, the dependence on salt concentration of each methyl transfer reaction was examined. Indeed, the enzymatic activity of Trm4p is optimal at high ionic concentration. 6Y. Motorin, unpublished results. Therefore, the ability of the different proteins to catalyze transfer of the labeled methyl group of [3H]AdoMet to unmodified mature yeast tRNAPhe transcript was tested at increasing NaCl concentrations (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, although the optimum activity of Trm4p and the NTrm4p:CTrm4p mixture was at about 300 mm NaCl, NTrm4p was active only at low salt concentrations. Because the optimum activity of NTrm4p is shifted to that of the whole enzyme in the presence of CTrm4p, this supports the formation of a ternary complex between tRNA, NTrm4p, and CTrm4p during catalysis. The Carboxyl-terminal Domain Contributes Considerably to the Efficiency of the Reaction—The role of each domain in the methyl transfer reaction was further analyzed by steady-state kinetics in comparison with full-length enzyme. Because the three active species had different salt-dependent profiles, their kinetic parameters for mature yeast tRNAPhe were determined both at low (50 mm) and high (300 mm) salt concentrations (Table 2 and Fig. 6), except that the catalytic activity of NTrm4p was measurable only at 50 mm NaCl. The catalytic constants for the native enzyme (kcat = 0.015 s-1 and KmtRNA = 1.1 μm at 300 mm NaCl) are similar to those reported for E. coli 16 S rRNA m5C967 MTase (26Gu X.R. Gustafsson C. Ku J. Yu M. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4053-4057Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Michaelis constants (KmtRNA) for the three active species are similar and do not vary significantly between the two salt concentrations. At 50 mm NaCl, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KmtRNA) of NTrm4p is 5.7-fold lower as compared with Trm4p, resulting from a decrease in kcat. In the presence of an equimolar amount of CTrm4p, the catalytic efficiency of NTrm4p is increased 2-fold, becoming only 3-fold lower than for the whole enzyme. Therefore, the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain is to enhance the catalytic efficiency of the amino-terminal domain mainly by increasing kcat. This effect is specific of CTrm4p because a 1:1 mixture of NTrm4p and bovine serum albumin exhibits the same catalytic constants as NTrm4p alone (data not shown). The role of CTrm4p is best shown at 300 mm NaCl, a salt concentration that is more physiological than 50 mm (27Garcia M.J. Rios G. Ali R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), because in its absence NTrm4p has no detectable activity.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of the various proteins for mature yeast tRNAPhe[NaCl]EnzymekcatKmkcat/Km10−3 s−1μM10−3 s−1 μM−150 mMTrm4p1.1 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.10.85NTrm4p + CTrm4p0.48 ± 0.041.7 ± 0.20.3NTrm4p0.19 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.10.15300 mMTrm4p15.0 ± 1.01.1 ± 0.113.6NTrm4p + CTrm4p1.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.12.0NTrm4pNot detectable Open table in a new tab The Amino-terminal Domain Alone Displays Multisite Specificity, Like the Whole Enzyme—To determine whether CTrm4p could play a role in targeting the location of modification in tRNA, the site specificities of Trm4p and NTrm4p were compared by probing the methylation of different RNA transcripts that could be modified only at one of the four possible positions (6Motorin Y. Grosjean H. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 1999; 5: 1105-1118Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). In addition, NTrm4p was shown not to have nonspecific activity by using poly(C) RNA as a negative control. Because the different RNA substrates, which are modified in positions 34, 40, 48, or 49 by Trm4p, are also methylated by NTrm4p, both proteins likely possess the same multisite specificity. Therefore, the catalytic core of Trm4p is apparently sufficient to target the four specific sites in the different tRNAs. Sequence analysis (7Reid R. Greene P.J. Santi D.V.

https://openalex.org/W2116810869,"Drosophila pseudoobscura harbors a rich gene arrangement polymorphism on the third chromosome generated by a series of overlapping paracentric inversions. The arrangements suppress recombination in heterokaryotypic individuals, which allows for the selective maintenance of coadapted gene complexes. Previous mapping experiments used to determine the degree to which recombination is suppressed in gene arrangement heterozygotes produced non-recombinant progeny in non-Mendelian ratios. The deviations from Mendelian expectations could be the result of viability differences between wild and mutant chromosomes, meiotic drive because of achiasmate pairing of homologues in heterokaryotypic females during meiosis, or a combination of both mechanisms. The possibility that the frequencies of the chromosomal arrangements in natural populations are affected by mechanisms other than adaptive selection led us to consider these hypotheses. We performed reciprocal crosses involving both heterozygous males and females to determine if the frequency of the non-recombinant progeny deviates significantly from Mendelian expectations and if the frequencies deviate between reciprocal crosses. We failed to observe non-Mendelian ratios in multiple crosses, and the frequency of the non-recombinant classes differed in only one of five pairs of reciprocal crosses despite sufficient power to detect these differences in all crosses. Our results indicate that deviations from Mendelian expectations in recombination experiments involving the D. pseudoobscura inversion system are most likely due to fitness differences of gene arrangement karyotypes in different environments."
