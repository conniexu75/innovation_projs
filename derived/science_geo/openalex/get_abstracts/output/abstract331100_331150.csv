https://openalex.org/W1977468235,"Significant differences and numerous similarities exist in the biosynthetic activities of marine and terrestrial plants and animals. While the more primitive marine biota are recognized to possess the common biosynthetic pathways to produce terpenes, acetogenins, aromatic compounds, and alkaloids, in many cases these pathways have been modified in unusual ways. The halogens in sebwater, for example, appear to be fundamentally involved in terpene biosynthesis and in the production of bromine-containinq acetogenins and phenolic compoupds. Marine metabolites have high physiological activities, and these molecules are conceived to function, in part at least, as defensive adaptations In the marine environment."

https://openalex.org/W2081365977,"The number of harp seals, Phoca groenlandica (Eodeben 1777) may now range from 2.25 million to 3 million. The total population is divided among three separate breeding stocks in the White Sea, the Greenland Sea, and the Northwest Atlantic. The continued exploitation of the Northwest Atlantic stock has caused controversy, primarily because of public concern for the fate of the newborn ""whitecoat."" The harp seal's life-cycle is marked by a progression from on-ice birth to in-water mating and subsequent on-ice molt. An extensive migration follows, taking these animals northward to high Arctic summering grounds and southward in an autumnal return migration to the breeding grounds. Harp seals are efficient divers and possess well-developed microsensory perceptions associated with anatomical adaptation to their environment. The relation between our understanding of the basic biology of the species and the confrontation that occurs between these mammals and man is considered with respect to our technological invasion of the North, the regulated commercial kill, and the slow movement toward multispecies management. Sound decisions regarding the exploitation of this species can only be made with a knowledge of its biology."

The salinities may be either ""paleosalinities"" or an effect produced by behavior of the clay-water system as a semipermeable membrane. The low pH values are due to higher pressures of CO(2) in the sediment, probably coming from bacterial decomposition of organic matter."
