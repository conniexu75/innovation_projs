https://openalex.org/W4231912247,"Sixty-one of 1676 lunar rock fragments examined were found to be anorthosites, markedly different in composition, color, and specific gravity from mare basalts and soil breccias. Compositional similiarity to Tycho ejecta analyzed by Surveyor 7 suggests that the anorthosites are samples of highlands material, thrown to Tranquillity Base by cratering events. A lunar structural model is proposed in which a 25-kilometer anorthosite crust, produced by magmatic fractionation, floats on denser gabbro. Where early major impacts punched through the crust, basaltic lava welled up to equilibrium surface levels and solidified (maria). Mascons are discussed in this context."
https://openalex.org/W2055402044,"Examination of multiphase melt inclusions in 91 sections of 26 lunar rocks revealed abundant evidence of late-stage immiscibility in all crystalline rock sections and in soil fragments and most breccias. The two individual immiscible silicate melts (now glasses) vary in composition, but are essentially potassic granite and pyroxenite. This immiscibility may be important in the formation of the lunar highlands and tektites. Other inclusions yield the following temperatures at which the several minerals first appear on cooling the original magma: ilmenite (?) liquidus, 1210 degrees C; pyroxene, 1140 degrees C; plagioclase, 1105 degrees C; solidus, 1075 degrees C. The glasses also place some limitations on maximum and minimum cooling rates."
https://openalex.org/W1983007985,"Petrographic and electron-microprobe studies combined with high pressure-temperature investigations of phase relationships in average Apollo 11 basalt and possible source material show that the lower parts of maria may be composed of eclogite (density 3.74 grams per cubic centimeter), thus explaining the existence of mascons. The Apollo 11 basalt was probably formed at depths of 200 to 400 kilometers by a small degree of partial melting from pyroxenitic source material [FeO/(FeO + MgO) = 0.25, Al2O3 ∼4 percent, CaO ∼3 percent]. This composition may be representative of the lunar interior and yields the observed mean lunar density and moment of inertia. Present data are in conflict with fission, binary planet, and capture hypotheses of lunar origin but are consistent with Ringwood's (1966) precipitation hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2061223355,"Fine, euhedral crystals of troilite from lunar sample 10050 show a hexagonal habit consistent with the high-temperature NiAs-type structure. Complete three-dimensional counter intensity data have been measured and used to confirm and refine Bertaut's proposed low-temperature crystal structure."
https://openalex.org/W2042303641,"Opaque mineral compositions indicate that the fugacity of oxygen is approximately 10(-13) (earth basalts, 10(-10)). Experiments under reducing conditions suggest that the crystallization range is approximately 1140 degrees to 1070 degrees C. Iron-rich pyroxmangite, fayalite, and hedenbergite occur in microgabbro. Ferropseudobrookite rimmed by ilmenite containing rutile and Cr-spinel lamellae occurs in ferrobasalt. Plagioclase vitrophyres in breccia can explain highland Surveyor VII analysis. We suggest crystal-liquid differentiation of out-gassed convecting moon with growing Fe-rich core, olivine-pyroxene mantle, plagioclase-rich dynamic crust underlain by nonspherical, inversely stratified ferrobasalt. Impact-breaking or convection-thrusting of crust releases fraction rich in Fe and Ti. Scanning electron microscopy of glass balls reveals minute depressions consistent with micrometeorite impact."
https://openalex.org/W1998084594,"Grain size and etching experiments show that the fine lunar material contains large amounts of trapped solar wind particles. Elemental and isotopic compositions of the noble gases in solar material and in the terrestrial atmosphere are significantly different, except for the Ar(36)/ Ar(38) and the Kr isotope ratios. Exposure ages of two rocks and of the fine material are between 380 and 510 x 10(6) years. Feldspar concentrates give K/Ar ages of 3220 and 3300 x 10(6) years, significantly higher than the unseparated rock."
https://openalex.org/W1971075312,"The lunar soil collected by Apollo 11 consists primarily of submillimeter material and is finer in grain size than soil previously recorded photographically by Surveyor experiments. The main constituents are fine-grained to glassy rocks of basaltic affinity and coherent breccia of undetermined origin. Dark glass, containing abundant nickel-iron spheres, coats many rocks, mineral, and breccia fragments. Several types of homogeneous glass occur as fragments and spheres. Colorless spheres, probably an exotic component, are abundant in the fraction finer than 20 microns."
https://openalex.org/W1965091914,"Highlights of a first effort in sorting out rare gases in lunar material are solar wind rare gases in abundance; variable (20)Ne/(22)Ne but constant (21)Ne/ (22)Ne ratios in fractions of the trapped neon; cosmogenic rare gases similar to those found in meteorites, except for copious (131)Xe in one rock but not in another; at Tranquillity Base a rock 4.1 x 10(9) years old which reached the surface 35 to 65 million years ago, amid soil whose particles have typically been within a meter of the surface for 10(9) years or more."
https://openalex.org/W2035428492,"The opaque minerals in the lunar rocks 10047, 10050, 10057, 10059, 10068 and in the dust were studied. Rock 10047 contains ilmenite as a main component besides Al-bearing chromian ulvöspinel, a new Ti, Fe, Zr, Y, Ca silicate, troilite, cobaltian alpha Fe, minor hafnian baddeleyite and dysanalyte. Dysanalyte contains Ca, Ti, and Fe as major elements and shows concentrations (rare earth elements together approximately 10 percent) of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Hf, Y, and Zr plus traces of Nb, Ba, and Na. The chemistry of ilmenite in the igneous rocks shows no appreciable variations. A new mineral of the solid solution series MgTi(2)O(5)-FeTi(2)O(5) has also been encountered in the polymict breccias. The microbreccias and the fines contain meteorite debris indicating an impact origin."
https://openalex.org/W1991502600,"The concentration of carbon and sulfur in six samples ranged between 20 to 200 and 650 to 2300 parts per million, respectively. Carbon was present in gaseous, volatilizable, and nonvolatile forms, and terrestrial contaminants were recognized. Sulfur appeared to exist only as acid-volatile sulfide. The bulk fines contain a high concentration of carbon and a low concentration of sulfur. They are always enriched in the heavier isotope carbon-13 or sulfur-34. The fine-grained basaltic rocks show the reverse relation; lowest carbon, highest sulfide concentrations, and no apparent enrichment in heavy isotopes. The breccias are of intermediate composition."
https://openalex.org/W2018050773,One-atmosphere melting data show that Apollo 11 samples are near cotectic. Melting relations at pressures up to 35 kilobars show that clinopyroxenite or amphibole peridotite are possible lunar interiors. Mascons cannot be eclogite; they may be ilmenite accumulate. Hot lunar surface material will boil off alkalis.
https://openalex.org/W1981882774,The rare gas analysis of the lunar surface has lead to important conclusions concerning the moon. The large amounts of rare gases found in the lunar soil and breccia indicate that the solar atmosphere is trapped in the lunar soil as no other source of such large amounts of gas is known. The cosmogenic products indicate that the exposure ages of the 17 lunar rocks measured vary from 20 to 400 million years with some grouping of the ages. The most striking feature is the old potassium-argon age which for the 14 rocks analyzed varies from 2.5 to 3.8 billion years. It is concluded that Mare Tranquillitatis crystallized about 4 billion years ago from a molten state produced by a large meteorite impact or volcanic flow.
https://openalex.org/W2003789120,"Chemical analyses and norms of four samples are presented which confirm original estimates of low silica, unusual abundance of titania, and low oxidation state of the rocks. Accounts are given of mineralogy and petrology of fine-and coarse-grained igneous rocks and microbreccias with emphasis on chemical composition of individual minerals and glasses. The glasses are either spheres that scatter widely around the composition of lunar basalts or coating glasses that approximate basalts and microbreccias in composition."
https://openalex.org/W2007621753,"The isotopic abundances of the rare gases in the fines are found to be similar to those previously reported for gas-rich meteorites. Relative to the heavy gases, neon and helium are depleted by factors of 2.5 and 10 respectively. Accurate krypton-krypton ages for rocks 10017, 10047, 10057, and 10071 were obtained covering a range of from 47 to 509 × 106 years. Varying relative production rates of the krypton and xenon isotopes in these rocks suggest different irradiation conditions and a complex history for at least some of the rocks."
https://openalex.org/W1996399451,"Impact has been an important rock-forming process on the moon. Electron- and ion-probe analyses of major and minor elements show that most glasses and chondrule-like particles formed by shock melting of various proportions of mainly pyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite. This is the first direct evidence that chondrule-like molten droplets can form in impact events. Welding and shock lithification resulted in rocks texturally similar to chondrites but composition rules out the moon as source for chondrites. Impact craters on a nickel-iron sample evidence the importance of secondary impacts by accelerated lunar matter."
https://openalex.org/W1994803600,"Glass spherules, glass fragments, augite, ferroaugite, titanaugite, pyroxmangite, pigeonite, hypersthene, plagioclase, potassium feldspar, maskelynite, olivine, silica, ilmenite, TiO(2), ""ferropseudobrookite,"" spinel, ulvöspinel, native iron, nickel-iron, troilite, and chlorapatite were analyzed with the electron microprobe. There are no indications of large-scale chemical differentiation, chemical weathering, or hydrous minerals. Contributions of meteoritic material to lunar surface rocks are small. Rocks with igneous textures originated from a melt that crystallized at or near the surface, and oxygen fugacities have been low. Shock features indicate that at least some surface material is impact-produced."
https://openalex.org/W2005723962,"Data from total melt and step-by-step heating experiments on the Apollo 11 lunar samples suggest a close affinity between lunar and meteoritic rare gases. Trapped neon-20/neon-22 ratios range from 11.5 to approximately 15, resembling those for the gas-rich meteorites. Trapped krypton and xenon in the lunar fines and in the carbonaceous chondrites are similar except for an interesting underabundance of the heavy isotopes in both lunar gases which suggests that the fission component found in carbonaceous chondrites is depleted in lunar material. Spallation gases are in most cases quite close to meteoritic spallation gases in isotopic composition."
https://openalex.org/W1975396293,"Phase chemistry, structure, and radiation effects were studied in rock, breccia, and soil samples. The regolith apparently developed in the final stages of accretion and was modified by later impact processes and radiation weathering. Exposure ages indicate transfer of buried igneous rock fragments to the near surface late in lunar history. With a few exceptions igneous rock fragments, soil, and breccia share the same distinctive chemistry, probably acquired before accretion of the moon. The igneous rocks texturally resemble basaltic achondrites, and the soil and breccias contain glassy spheres analogous to chondrules."
https://openalex.org/W2015935133,"The concentrations and isotopic abundances of the rare gases have been investigated in fines and three types of rocks. The results obtained from different grain-size fractions and from samples etched to different degrees with nitric and hydrofluoric acids demonstrate the strong concentrations of the solar-wind component in the surface layers of the grains. Exposure ages as well as gas retention ages have been determined in different types of Apollo 11 material. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and other gases have been analyzed by a high-resolution mass spectrometer. As compared with that in terrestrial water, deuterium is depleted by at least a factor of 3 in the investigated type C rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2070610997,"Particle track densities up to > 3 x 10(9) per square centimeter have been measured in different samples. Rocks 17, 47, 57, and 58 have VH (Z >22) galactic cosmic ray ages of 11, 14, 28, and 13 x 10(6) years, respectively. Rock 57 has a calculated erosion rate of 10(-7) centimeter per year. Near-surface track versus depth data in rock 17 can be fit with solar flare particles that have a differential energy spectrum aE(-3); lunar samples can be used to study the history of solar activity. The uranium in the crystalline rocks occurs principally in small regions <10 to approximately 100 micrometers in size. The (low) thermoluminescence of the fines increases with depth in core 10004. With one possible exception, x-ray studies have not shown pronounced radiation damage effects. The total energy release upon heating is small up to 900 degrees C and occurs in three broad regions."
https://openalex.org/W2035580795,"Constituents of lunar soils and rocks were studied by powder and singlecrystal x-ray diffraction. In addition to identification of minerals, including rare amphibole, mica, and aragonite, a detailed study of the important rock-forming minerals of the plagioclase, pyroxene, and olivine groups has begun. Mössbauer spectra were recorded from lunar soils, ground rock samples, and separates of iron-bearing minerals. The proportions of iron-bearing minerals were estimated from computer-fitted areas for the bulk samples. The Fe(2+) in the lower-density fraction of pyroxene was ordered, whereas that of the higher-density fraction was disordered."
https://openalex.org/W2070844254,"Single-crystal x-ray diffraction, microprobe, optical and electron optical examinations of clinopyroxenes from Apollo 11 lunar samples 10003, 10047, 10050, and 10084 show that generally the crystals are composed of (001) augite-pigeonite intergrowths in varying ratios. Transmission electron micrographs reveal abundant exsolution lamellae, many only 60 Å thick. In addition to the phase inhomogeneities, primary chemical inhomogeneities are clearly demonstrated. There are reciprocal relationships between calcium and iron and between Ti4+ + 2Al and R2+ + 2Si. Our evidence suggests that a chemically inhomogeneous subcalcic C2/c augite was the only primary pyroxene from which pigeonite later exsolved."
https://openalex.org/W2025105170,"All phases in a thin section of sample 10022 have been analyzed by electron microprobe. Augite grains show strong iron enrichment in the outer 15 to 20 microns. Pigeonite cores occur within augite grains. The plagioclase has an anorthite content of between 73 and 81 mole percent and is high in Si and low in Al compared to stoichiometric feldspar. Residual phases include microcrystalline Fe-rich ""pyroxene,"" plagioclase, K-rich alkali feldspar, silica, and rare areas rich in P and Zr with concentrations of Ba, Y, and rare earth elements. The density, viscosity, and crystallization history of the lava of sample 10022 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1977411949,"Five grams of coarse fines (10085,11) contains 1227 grains, mostly mafic holocrystalline rock fragments, microbreccia, and glass spatter and agglomerates with less abundant anorthosite fragments and regularly shaped glass. The crystalline lithic fragments in the coarse fines and microbreccias represent a closely related suite of gabbroid igneous rocks that have a wider range of modal analyses and textures than seen in the larger crystalline rock samples returned by Apollo 11. Petrographic evidence of shock metamorphism is common, and the abundant glass is almost all shock-produced. None of the glass observed is similar to tektite glass."
https://openalex.org/W2048925050,"A new mineral (approximately Fe0.5Mg0.5Ti2O5) related to the pseudobrookite series has been discovered in section 10071,28. Electron-probe analyses for this mineral, a coexisting ilmenite, and a chromian ulvöspinel-ilmenite assemblage in section 10020,40 indicate crystallization under highly reducing conditions. Analytical and optical absorption studies of the olivine in 10020 show it to contain unusually high Cr (1400 parts per million) probably as Cr2+."
https://openalex.org/W1972761921,"On the basis of rock modes, textures, and mineralogy, unshocked crystalline rocks are classified into a dominant ilmenite-rich suite (subdivided into intersertal, ophitic, and hornfels types) and a subordinate feldspar-rich suite (subdivided into poikilitic and granular types). Weakly to moderately shocked rocks show high strain-rate deformation and solid-state transformation of minerals to glasses; intensely shocked rocks are converted to rock glasses. Data on an unknown calcium-bearing iron metasilicate are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2014516353,"Microscope study and electron microprobe analysis of lunar rocks and soil show that ilmenite, troilite, and native iron are accompanied by trace amounts of ulvöspinel, titanochromite (new mineral name), an unidentified Ti-Fe oxide, and a complex Zr-Y silicate. The assemblage requires a strongly reducing environment. Textures and modal proportions show that the rocks present are not a differentiation series. The restricted nature of the opaque mineral assemblage suggests a narrow range of composition for the materials from which the parent liquids of the rocks were generated. Textural variety mnust reflect differences in cooling rates, probably related to depths of formation."
https://openalex.org/W2022116805,"Sample 10084,40 (fines, less than 1 millimeter) contains substantial amounts of the inert gases. Their concentrations are inversely proportional to particle size; hence the gases appear to be surface-correlated in the soil fragments. The most likely origin of the gas is solar wind or solar cosmic rays. Glass and feldspar are generally poorer in gas than lithic fragments. Ratios of elements in the sample differ significantly from solar values. Ratios of isotopes in the sample are similar to those in meteorites. Argon-40 appears to consist of a radiogenic and a surface-correlated component. An apparent potassium-argon age of 4.42+0.24-0.28 billion years is calculated."
https://openalex.org/W2012038614,"During crystallization of lunar crystalline rocks 10022 and 10024, augite changes in composition almost continuously from titanaugite (∼ Ca36Mg47Fe17 with TiO2 ∼3 percent) to a very iron-rich variety (Ca9Mg5Fe86), pigeonite changes from Ca9Mg66Fe25 to Ca10Mg51Fe39, and olivine changes (in 10022) from Mg71Fe29 to Mg41Fe59, whereas plagioclase stays as bytownite. These compositional variations, as well as the textural relations, may be explained by rapid crystallization of undercooled magmas. The residual liquids found as mesostasis are rhyolitic, which suggests that fractional crystallization of some lunar mafic magmas can generate rhyolitic magmas. Melting experiments were made on crystalline rocks to determine liquidus temperatures and crystallizing phases."
https://openalex.org/W2019980112,Complex intergrowths of troilite (FeS) and iron in the igneous rocks from Tranquillity Base contain 8.4 percent native iron by volume. The intergrowths were derived from an initially homogeneous sulfide liquid that separated immiscibly from the magma at 1140°C or above. Textures show that the sulfide liquid formed late in the crystallization and cooling history of the igneous rocks and after the major ilmenite and pyroxene had formed.
https://openalex.org/W1990365213,"The internal substructures of a type B sample have been examined at high magnification and compared with terrestrial rocks. Selected ultrathin sections were prepared from these multiphase materials by an ion-thinning technique and examined in a 1-Mev electron microscope, with complementary optical analyses. The structures in the ilmenite and plagioclase indicate that the lunar material has undergone plastic deformation by dislocation movement and possibly microtwinning, with subsequent recovery. The pyroxene exhibits complex lamellar structures of submicron spacing. These various observations are consistent with the optical microscopy evidence for distortion and recovery and identify the processes involved."
https://openalex.org/W2083743312,"Observations on the mineralogy and deformation in samples of crystalline rocks, breccias, and fines from Tranquillity Base provide evidence for magmatic and impact processes. Overall homogeneity, igneous textures, and absence of xenoliths in the crystalline rocks indicate derivation from a common titanium-rich magma by internal, anorogenic volcanism rather than by impact. Crystallization conditions allowed strong compositional variation in pyroxenes, olivine, and plagioclase and the growth of a new mineral, the iron analog of pyroxmangite. Subsequently, impact produced breccias containing shock-deformed crystals and glasses of varying compositions."
https://openalex.org/W2084813912,"Glass spherules show multiple high-velocity impact craters and are coated with small particles including glass, plagioclase, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, olivine, chromite, rock fragments, and frozen droplets of iron, nickel-iron, and troilite. These spherules passed through an impact cloud of hot fragmental material, condensing iron-rich vapor and high-velocity projectiles. Breccia contains concentric, accretionary lapilli units and appears to be a sintered deposit from a hot lunar base surge generated by impact."
https://openalex.org/W1983331020,"Particle tracks in Apollo 11 samples are dominantly of cosmic ray and solar origin: primary galactic and solar flare particles, likely spallation recoil tracks, and possible solar-wind heavy particles. The energy spectrum of irongroup nuclei is inferred from track density gradients in surface layers, and a limit of << 10(-7) centimeter per year is deduced for the surface erosion rate. From cosmic ray tracks in rock and core samples it is clear that the lunar soil is stirred often during each few million years. X-rays reveal augite, anorthite, olivine, ilmenite, troilite, nonmeteoritic iron, and assorted glasses, but no major structural damage. Hydrogen, helium, and other gases in the fines are compatible with expected solar wind ratios."
https://openalex.org/W2033097597,"A large number of radionuclides have been measured as a function of depth in lunar rock 10017 and in bulk fines. Data are reported on (10)Be, (22)Na, (26)Al, (36)Cl, (49)V, (53)mn, (54)Mn (55)Fe, (56)Co, (57)Co, and (59)Ni and on upper limits for (46)Sc, (48)V, (51)Cr, and (60)Co. The results for several nuclides show striking evidence of excess surface production attributable to solar flare particles. Data for short-lived species, (56)Co, (57)CO, (54)Mn, (55)Fe, and (22)Na, appear consistent with fluxes from known recent events. Long-lived species demonstrate the existence of solar flare protons and alphas at least for the last 10(5) to 10(6) years, at fluxes comparable to those now observerved."
https://openalex.org/W1980417493,"Magnetite crystals larger than 2 micrometers are absent from rocks and fines. Smaller opaque spheres in the fines can tentatively be identified as magnetite. Their concentration is not higher than 1 x 10(-6) particle per particle smaller than 1 millimeter. In the fines from the sampling site, the contribution of material similar to type 1 carbonaceous meteorites is insignificant, either because it never existed, or because it was evaporated or comminuted by impact or was diluted by indigenous material. Other magnetite habits typical of carbonaceous meteorites or possibly of cosmic dust or comets were also sought without success-such as rods, platelets, framboids, spherulites, and idiomorphic crystals."
https://openalex.org/W2050559070,"The lunar samples consist largely of augite, calcic plagioclase, and ilmenite. Olivine is a minor constituent of some rocks, as is cristobalite. Other minerals present in small amounts include tridymite, chromite, kamacite, taenite, and troilite. The principal rock types can be broadly grouped into ilmenite basalts and breccias. Except for their high ilmenite content, the lunar rocks resemble the calcium-rich achondritic meteorites (eucrites and howardites) in composition and structure. Evidence of a meteoritic increment in the lunar soil is provided by the presence of nickel-iron particles in glass and breccia, and the occurrence of metal-troilite spheroids; the breccias contain occasional silicate aggregates that resemble meteoritic chondrules. The lunar fines contain 325 parts of watersoluble calcium per million."
https://openalex.org/W2028712311,"The primary rocks are a sequence of titanium-rich basic volcanics, composed of clinopyroxene, plagioclase, and ilmenite with minor olivine, troilite, and native iron. The soil and microbreccias are respectively loose and compacted mixtures of fragments and aggregates of similar rocks, minerals, and glassy fragments and spheres. Impact events are reflected by the presence of shock metamorphosed rock fragments, breccias, and glasses and their resulting compaction to form complex breccias, glass-spattered surfaces, and numerous glass-lined craters. Chemistry of the glasses formed by the impact events is highly variable, and the high iron and nickel content of a few moundlike features suggests that at least some of the projectiles are iron and nickel-rich meteorites."
https://openalex.org/W1967094023,"The calcium-rich pyroxenes in lunar samples 10047, 10058, and 10062 show pronounced sectoral and radial compositional variations which correlate with sharp to gradual variations in color and optical properties. The pyroxenes apparently grew as nearly euhedral crystals from melts of approximately the same composition as that of the samples. The coupled substitutions determined across sector boundaries suggest that Al is predominantly in the tetrahedral site and that Ti is predominantly quadrivalent. The pyroxene differentiation trend (unknown in terrestrial pyroxenes) is toward extreme enrichment in the ferrosilite molecule. The iron-enriched portions of the pyroxene grains may have grown with a triclinic pyroxenoid structure."
https://openalex.org/W2055159282,"A gamma-ray spectrometry system with low background was used to determine the radioactivity of crystalline rocks, breccias, and fine material. Nuclides identified were (40)K, (232)Th, (238)U, (7)Be, (22)Na (26)A1, (44)Ti, (46)Sc, (48)V, (52)Mn, (54)Mn, and (56)Co. Concentrations of K, Th, and U ranged between 480 and 2550, 1.01 and 3.30, and 0.26 and 0.83 parts per million, respectively. Concentrations of thorium and uranium were those of terrestrial basalts, while the potassium concentrations were near values for chondrites. Products of low-energy nuclear reactions showed pronounced concentration gradients at rock surfaces. Concentrations of K and of (22)Na determined here were combined with concentrations of rare gases to estimate gas-retention ages and cosmic-ray exposure ages with ranges of 2200 to 3200 and 34 to 340 million years, respectively, for three rocks."
https://openalex.org/W1995865318,"Crystals of calcic bytownite from type B rocks have space group I1 with c approximately 14 angstroms. Bytownite crystals from type A rocks are more sodic and have space group C1, c approximately 7 angstroms. Cell parameters of eight bulk feldspar separates from crystalline rocks indicate that the range of angle gamma is about 23 times the standard error of measurement, and its value might be useful for estimation of composition. Cell parameters of seven ilmenites are close to those of pure FeTiO(3)."
https://openalex.org/W2087719078,"Tritium and argon radioactivities, attributable to galactic and solar cosmic-ray interactions, were measured in lunar soil and in three lunar rocks. The tritium in the soil, 325 +/- 17 disintegrations per minute per kilogram, is slightly higher than that in the rocks, 212 to 250 dpm/kg. For two rocks, the tritium was combined with the helium-3 in order to calculate exposure ages of 375 +/- 40 and 205 +/- 25 million years. The argon-37 radioactivities, 21.0 to 27.2 dpm/kg, and the argon-39 radioactivities, 12.1 to 16.4 dpm/kg, are slightly higher than those in stony meteorites. Higher exposure ages were obtained from the argon isotopes than from tritium and helium-3. On the basis of the known galactic cosmic-ray flux and the known cross section, at least half of the observed radioactivities are produced by solar cosmic rays."
https://openalex.org/W2039089608,"Three lunar rocks show almost identical mineralogy but grain sizes that vary from basaltic to gabbroic. Clinopyroxene is zoned from augite to subcalcic ferroaugite compositions and is accompanied by decrease in Cr, Al, and Ti. Plagioclase is zoned from 93 to 78 percent anorthite. Olivine (68 percent forsterite) is present in one rock and apatite is rare. Cristobalite, ilmenite with Ti-rich lamellae, ulvöspinel (often Cr-rich), troilite, and kamacite are low in trace elements. Glassy spherules are of basaltic or feldspathic (92 percent anorthite) composition but contain abundant iron spheres of taenite composition (13 percent Ni). Four rock analyses by x-ray fluorescence show affinity with terrestrial basalts but with anomalous amounts of Ti, Na, Cr, Zr, Y, Rb, Nb, Ni, Cu, and Zn."
https://openalex.org/W2050788391,"The argon radioactivities (37)Ar and (39)Ar were obtained by vacuum melting from interior and exterior portions of rock 10057 and from a portion of the fines from the bulk sample container. The release of argon and tritium as a function of the temperature was followed for the fine material. A comparison is made of the activities observed in the lunar samples with those expected from the spallation of iron, titanium, and calcium. From these data and the (38)Ar content, the cosmic ray exposure age of rock 10057 is deduced as 110 x 10(6) years."
https://openalex.org/W2090650571,"The (7)Be, (22)Na, (26)Al, (44)Ti, (46)SC, (48)V (51)Cr, (54)Mn, (56)Co, (57)Co, (57)CO, (40)K, (238)U, and (232)Th were measured in lunar fines and portions of three rocks. Major production of cosmogenic radionuclides is due to solar protons, thus their concentrations are far different than those in meteorites. Surface exposures of the rocks and fines are long compared with the 0.74 million year half-life of (26)Al. Lunar fines show substantially higher concentrations of low energy reaction products. The ratios of thorium to uranium are extremely constant at 3.8, which indicates very little geochemical differentiation and are in good agreement with a common nucleosynthesis for lunar and earth materials."
https://openalex.org/W2057304217,"Fragments of igneous rocks and breccias, and one coarse-grained rock with thin sections, have been studied. Minerals found include pyroxene, plagioclase, olivine, ilmenite, troilite, ulvöspinel, native iron, cristobalite, tridymite, alkali feldspar, apatite, and quartz. Textures are described and interpreted. Among features revealed by optical, microprobe, x-ray diffraction, and electron microscope methods are extreme zoning and unmixing in pyroxene grains, compositional variations in ilmenites, and effects of shock metamorphism. Some trace elements were determined by x-ray fluorescence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1989410887,"The rare gas distribution in lunar soil, breccias, and rocks was studied with a micro-helium-probe. Gases are concentrated in grain surfaces and originate from solar wind. Helium-4 concentrations of different mineral components vary by more than a factor of 10 apart from individual fluctuations for each type. Also grains with no detectable helium-4 exist. Titanium-rich components have the highest, calcium-rich minerals the lowest concentrations. The solar wind was redistributed by diffusion. Mean gas layer thicknesses are 10, 6, and 5 μm for helium, neon, and argon respectively. Lithic fragments in breccias contain no solar gases. Glass pitted surfaces of crystalline rocks contain about 10-2 cubic centimeter of helium-4 per square centimeter. Etched dust grains clearly show spallogenic and radiogenic components. The apparent mean exposure age of dust is approximately 500 × 106 years, its potassium-argon age is approximately 3.5 × 109 years. Cavities of crystalline rocks contain helium-4, radiogenic argon, H2, and N2."
https://openalex.org/W2029306703,"Ilmenite, chrome-titanium spinel, ulvöspinel, troilite, native iron, iron-nickel alloy, and native copper are present. In addition mackinawite is provisionally identified. Three additional opaque phases are present but not identified. Modal analysis indicates that the breccia is enriched in iron relative to ilmenite and troilite, and the high nickel content of this iron suggests that it is largely of meteoritic origin. The bulk composition of liquids corresponding to iron/troilite droplets in the rocks indicates an oxygen fugacity no greater than 10(-15.5) and a sulfur fugacity of 10(-6) bar. Complete melting of rocks produced a glass containing complex iron/troilite globules and skeletal ilmenites."
https://openalex.org/W2050779914,"Plagioclase and olivine crystals in the crystalline rocks from the Sea of Tranquillity show little or no evidence of either static or dynamic deformation. The large disorientations in many of the pyroxene crystals are commonly consistent with slip on the system T = {100}, t = [001], but these distortions are not due to plastic flow. They are ascribed to rapid growth and quenching phenomena as deduced from studies of chondrules and of quenched natural and experimentally produced melts. Some of the silicates in the breccias and regolith show evidence of shock deformation, from mild to intense, as indicated by pervasive fracturing, shock lamallae, and partial transformation of pyroxene and plagioclase crystals to glass."
https://openalex.org/W2019032364,"Plagioclase feldspar, clinopyroxene, and ilmenite in a polished thin section of a type A crystalline rock were analyzed. The clinopyroxene grains are compositionally variable, and both high Ca and low Ca phases are present. The plagioclase is compositionally homogeneous. The ilmenite is chemically homogeneous except for occasional, small areas of high local chromium concentration. Accessory minerals are: apatite (containing Cl, F, Y, and Ce), troilite, and metallic iron. Glassy spherules from the lunar soil are for the most part similar in composition to the crystalline rocks; however, some appear to have been monomineralic. The crystalline rock has apparently formed by relatively rapid cooling of a silicate melt under conditions of low oxygen partial pressure. Many components of the soil appear to have formed by meteoritic impact."
