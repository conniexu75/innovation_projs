https://openalex.org/W2995568124,"The Greenland Ice Sheet has been a major contributor to global sea-level rise in recent decades1,2, and it is expected to continue to be so3. Although increases in glacier flow4,5,6 and surface melting7,8,9 have been driven by oceanic10,11,12 and atmospheric13,14 warming, the magnitude and trajectory of the ice sheet’s mass imbalance remain uncertain. Here we compare and combine 26 individual satellite measurements of changes in the ice sheet’s volume, flow and gravitational potential to produce a reconciled estimate of its mass balance. The ice sheet was close to a state of balance in the 1990s, but annual losses have risen since then, peaking at 345 ± 66 billion tonnes per year in 2011. In all, Greenland lost 3,902 ± 342 billion tonnes of ice between 1992 and 2018, causing the mean sea level to rise by 10.8 ± 0.9 millimetres. Using three regional climate models, we show that the reduced surface mass balance has driven 1,964 ± 565 billion tonnes (50.3 per cent) of the ice loss owing to increased meltwater runoff. The remaining 1,938 ± 541 billion tonnes (49.7 per cent) of ice loss was due to increased glacier dynamical imbalance, which rose from 46 ± 37 billion tonnes per year in the 1990s to 87 ± 25 billion tonnes per year since then. The total rate of ice loss slowed to 222 ± 30 billion tonnes per year between 2013 and 2017, on average, as atmospheric circulation favoured cooler conditions15 and ocean temperatures fell at the terminus of Jakobshavn Isbræ16. Cumulative ice losses from Greenland as a whole have been close to the rates predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for their high-end climate warming scenario17, which forecast an additional 70 to 130 millimetres of global sea-level rise by 2100 compared with their central estimate."
https://openalex.org/W2996533510,"Functionalization of the β-C-H bonds of aliphatic acids is emerging as a valuable synthetic disconnection that complements a wide range of conjugate addition reactions1-5. Despite efforts for β-C-H functionalization in carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond-forming reactions, these have numerous crucial limitations, especially for industrial-scale applications, including lack of mono-selectivity, use of expensive oxidants and limited scope6-13. Notably, the majority of these reactions are incompatible with free aliphatic acids without exogenous directing groups. Considering the challenge of developing C-H activation reactions, it is not surprising that achieving different transformations requires independent catalyst design and directing group optimizations in each case. Here we report a Pd-catalysed β-C(sp3)-H lactonization of aliphatic acids enabled by a mono-N-protected β-amino acid ligand. The highly strained and reactive β-lactone products are versatile linchpins for the mono-selective installation of diverse alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkynyl, fluoro, hydroxyl and amino groups at the β position of the parent acid, thus providing a route to many carboxylic acids. The use of inexpensive tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant to promote the desired selective reductive elimination from the Pd(IV) centre, as well as the ease of product purification without column chromatography, render this reaction amenable to tonne-scale manufacturing."
https://openalex.org/W2996473838,"Background Adjuvant endocrine treatment improves survival after estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. Recurrences occur, and most patients with metastatic breast cancer develop treatment resistance and incurable disease. An influential factor in relation to endocrine treatment resistance is tumor hypoxia and the hypoxia inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Poor perfusion makes tumors hypoxic and induces the HIFs, which promote cell survival. We previously showed that hypoxic breast cancer cells are tamoxifen-resistant, and that HIF-inhibition restored tamoxifen-sensitivity. We found that HIF-induced tamoxifen-resistance involve cross-talk with epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), which itself is linked to tamoxifen resistance. Contralateral breast cancer (CBC), i.e. development of a second breast cancer in the contralateral breast despite adjuvant tamoxifen treatment is in essence a human in vivo-model for tamoxifen-resistance that we explore here to find molecular pathways of tamoxifen-resistance. Methods We constructed a tissue-microarray including tumor-tissue from a large well-defined cohort of CBC-patients, a proportion of which got their second breast cancer despite ongoing adjuvant therapy. Using immunohistochemistry >500 patients were evaluable for HIF-1α and EGFR in both tumors, and correlations to treatment, patient outcome, prognostic and predictive factors were analyzed. Results We found an increased proportion of HIF-1α-positive tumors in tamoxifen-resistant (CBC during adjuvant tamoxifen) compared to naïve tumors (CBC without prior tamoxifen). Tumor HIF-1α-positivity correlated to increased breast cancer mortality, and negative prognostic factors including low age at diagnosis and ER-negativity. There was a covariance of HIF-1α- and EGFR-expression and also EGFR-expression correlated to poor prognosis. Conclusions The increased percentage of HIF-1α-positive tumors formed during adjuvant tamoxifen suggests a role for HIF-1α in escaping tamoxifen’s restraining effects on breast cancer. Implicating a potential benefit of HIF-inhibitors in targeting breast cancers resistant to endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2996482541,"Socially competent animals must learn to modify their behavior in response to their social partner in a contextually appropriate manner. Dominant-subordinate relationships are a particularly salient social context for mice. Here we observe and analyze the microstructure of social and non-social behaviors as 21 pairs of outbred CD-1 male mice (Mus Musculus) establish dominant-subordinate relationships during daily 20-minute interactions for five consecutive days in a neutral environment. Firstly, using a Kleinberg burst detection algorithm, we demonstrate aggressive and subordinate interactions occur in bursting patterns followed by quiescent periods rather than being uniformly distributed across social interactions. Secondly, we identify three phases of dominant-subordinate relationship development (pre-, middle-, and post-resolution) by utilizing two statistical methods to identify stability in aggressive and subordinate behavior across these bursts. Thirdly, using First Order Markov Chains we find that dominant and subordinate mice show distinct behavioral transitions, especially between tail rattling and other aggressive/subordinate behaviors. Further, dominant animals engaged in more digging and allogrooming behavior and were more likely to transition from sniffing their partner’s body to head, whereas subordinates were more likely to transition from head sniffing to side-by-side contact. Lastly, we utilized a novel method (Forward Spike Time Tiling Coefficient) to assess how individuals respond to the behaviors of their partner. We found that subordinates decrease their tail rattling and aggressive behavior in response to aggressive but not subordinate behavior exhibited by dominants and that tail rattling in particular may function to deescalate aggressive behavior in pairs. Our findings demonstrate that CD-1 male mice rapidly establish dominance relationships and modify their social and non-social behaviors according to their current social status. The methods that we detail also provide useful tools for other researchers wishing to evaluate the temporal dynamics of rodent social behavior."

Previous studies demonstrated that Maf proteins are processed by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, but the mechanisms remain elusive. This study applied MS to identify MafB ubiquitination-associated proteins and found that the ubiquitin-specific protease USP7 was present in the MafB interactome. Moreover, USP7 also interacted with c-Maf and MafA and blocked their polyubiquitination and degradation. Consistently, knockdown of USP7 resulted in Maf protein degradation along with increased polyubiquitination levels. The action of USP7 thus promoted Maf transcriptional activity as evidenced by luciferase assays and by the up-regulation of the expression of Maf-modulated genes. Furthermore, USP7 was up-regulated in myeloma cells, and it was negatively associated with the survival of myeloma patients. USP7 promoted myeloma cell survival, and when it was inhibited by its specific inhibitor P5091, myeloma cell lines underwent apoptosis. These results therefore demonstrated that USP7 is a deubiquitinase of Maf proteins and promotes MM cell survival in association with Maf stability.

The role of immunotherapy in multiple myeloma.Pharmaceuticals. 2016; 9 (26784207): E310.3390/ph9010003Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and it is widely associated with genetic and cytogenetic aberrations. These characteristic events include various gene mutations (such as TP53, KRAS, NRAS, MYC, and BRAF) and chromosomal abnormalities (including trisomies, monosomies, deletions, and chromosomal translocations) (2Lohr J.G.

The chromosomal translocations are mainly observed between chromosome 14 that represents IgH and other specific chromosomes. The most common ones are t(4;14)(p16:q32), t(6;14)(p21:q32), t(11;14)(q13:q32), t(14;16)(q32:q23), and t(14;20)(q32:q12), which have been found in more than half of MM cell lines and MM patients (3Fonseca R.

Among these translocations, t(8:14), t(14:20), and t(14:16) lead to the high expression of MafA, MafB, and c-Maf, respectively (3Fonseca R. Barlogie B. Bataille R. Bastard C. Bergsagel P.L. Chesi M.

In addition to chromosomal translocations, other genetic events also up-regulate the expression of Maf proteins in MM cells (4Qiang Y.W. Ye S. Chen Y. Buros A.F. Edmonson R. van Rhee F. Barlogie B.

MafA, MafB, and c-Maf belong to the basic zipper Maf transcription factor family and up-regulate the transcription of several critical genes, including cyclin D2 (CCND2), AMP-activated protein kinase-related protein kinase (ARK5), and integrin β7 (ITGB7) in the development and progression of MM (5van Stralen E. van de Wetering M.

Protein ubiquitination is a multiple-step process by adding the small protein ubiquitin to the protein substrates under the direction of specific ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin ligases. Notably, protein ubiquitination is a reversible process in which the attached ubiquitin molecules could be removed (or hydrolyzed) by a group of proteins called deubiquitinases or ubiquitin-specific proteases (11Reyes-Turcu F.E. Ventii K.H. Wilkinson K.D. Regulation and cellular roles of ubiquitin-specific deubiquitinating enzymes.Annu. Rev.

Among the Maf family proteins, c-Maf has been well-documented to be ubiquitinated by ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O (12Xu Y. Zhang Z. Li J. Tong J. Cao B. Taylor P. Tang X. Wu D. Moran M.F. Zeng Y. Mao X. The ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O modulates c-Maf stability and induces myeloma cell apoptosis.J. Hematol.

This study applied co-immunoprecipitation–coupled MS to identify MafB-associated ubiquitination enzymes and found that the ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) could interact with and stabilize all MafA, MafB, and c-Maf proteins by preventing their polyubiquitination. Moreover, inhibition of USP7 leads to Maf protein degradation and MM cell apoptosis, which forms a framework for the precision treatment of Maf-expressing MM. The Maf genes have been reported to be highly expressed in MM cells and primary MM cells in association with various characteristic chromosomal translocations and other unknown events, but the protein expressions were largely unknown. Therefore, we first evaluated the expression profiles of Maf proteins in MM cell lines. As shown in Fig. 1A, c-Maf was found in most cell lines, especially in LP1, OCI-MY5, MM1.R, and RPMI-8226, and in contrast, MafB was highly expressed in LP1, MM1.S, MM1.R, and RPMI-8226 but not in OCI-MY5 and others. To find out whether inhibition of these Maf proteins could lead to MM cell apoptosis, RPMI-8226, LP1, and OCI-MY5 cells were transfected with Maf-specific siRNAs, followed by annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that MM cells underwent apoptosis as demonstrated by a marked increase in the fraction of annexin V–positive cells at both MafB (Fig. 1, B and C) and c-Maf (Fig. 1D) knockdowns. Consistent with this finding, cleaved caspase-3 was also markedly increased in all cell lines with Maf gene knockdown (Fig. 1, B–D). These findings further suggest the Maf proteins could be potential therapeutic targets for MM. We previously reported that ubiquitination-associated enzymes were involved in the ubiquitination of c-Maf (13Zhang Z. Tong J. Tang X. Juan J. Cao B. Hurren R. Chen G. Taylor P. Xu X. Shi C.X. Du J. Hou J. Wang G. Wu D. Stewart A.K. et al.The ubiquitin ligase HERC4 mediates c-Maf ubiquitination and delays the growth of multiple myeloma xenografts in nude mice.Blood. 2016; 127 (26825710): 1676-168610.1182/blood-2015-07-658203Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To find the associated enzymes regulating MafB ubiquitination, we performed an AP/MS assay, as described previously (13Zhang Z. Tong J. Tang X. Juan J. Cao B. Hurren R. Chen G. Taylor P. Xu X. Shi C.X. Du J. Hou J. Wang G. Wu D. Stewart A.K. et al.The ubiquitin ligase HERC4 mediates c-Maf ubiquitination and delays the growth of multiple myeloma xenografts in nude mice.Blood. 2016; 127 (26825710): 1676-168610.1182/blood-2015-07-658203Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The MS data were analyzed based on three independent paired studies (including the following three groups: control vector, MafB plasmid, and MafB plasmid + MG132 treatment). To identify potential interacting proteins with MafB, the criteria were set as follows: 1) the minimal average of unique peptides ≥2 with a p value <0.05 in both MafB and MafB + MG132 groups; 2) no unique peptides were found in at least two of three of the tested samples or the average number of the unique peptides in the control group <2. Based on these criteria, 264 proteins were identified by AP/MS in association with MafB (Table S1). Notably, several ubiquitination-associated enzymes include the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2O, ubiquitin ligases ARIH1, HUWE1, and RAD18, and deubiquitinases USP7 and USP9x (Table 1). Notably, our previous study has demonstrated that UBE2O interacts with and induces MafB and c-Maf ubiquitination and degradation (12Xu Y. Zhang Z. Li J. Tong J. Cao B. Taylor P. Tang X. Wu D.

The unique peptides of USP7 are shown in Fig. 2A.Table 1MafB-associated ubiquitination-associated enzymes identified by AP/MSClassificationGene namesProtein IDTotal MS spectral countsSequence coverageMassMafB_1MafB_2MafB_3MafB-MG132_1MafB-MG132_2MafB-MG132_3NC_1NC_2NC_3%kDaE2UBE2OQ9C0C9031202700016.4141.29E3HUWE1Q7Z6Z7-2159645375256800030.2480.19E3ARIH1Q9Y4X50611031000028.964.117E3RAD18Q9NS910715041500041.856.222DubUSP7Q930096425641000028.9128.3DubUSP9XQ93008-102702140009.4290.46 Open table in a new tab First, we verified the interaction between USP7 and Maf proteins at both endogenous and exogenous expression contexts. In the exogenous expression model, USP7 was co-transfected with MafB, MafA, or c-Maf plasmids into HEK293T cells followed by IP/IB assay, and the results showed that Maf proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with USP7 (Fig. 2, B–D), suggesting USP7 interacted with Maf proteins. To verify this interaction at the endogenous setting in MM cells, cell lysates directly from MM cell lines RPMI-8226, OCI-MY5, and LP1 cells were subjected to IP/IB analyses. The results showed that USP7 bound to endogenous MafB and c-Maf proteins in RPMI-8226/LP1 (Fig. 2E) and RPMI-8226/OCI-MY5 (Fig. 2F) cell lines, respectively. To further characterize this interaction, a series of USP7 truncates were prepared (Fig. 2G), followed by co-transfection with a MafB plasmid into HEK293T cells. The cell lysates were then subjected to co-IP and IB assays. As shown in Fig. 2H, all truncates were successfully expressed and identified by a specific antibody; however, all truncates except the catalytic domain were detected from MafB precipitates (Fig. 2I), suggesting the TRAF and the UBL domains probably mediated the interaction between Maf and USP7 because the presence of either TRAF or UBL domain was sufficient for the interaction. As a typical ubiquitin-specific protease, USP7 has been shown to catalyze the ubiquitin chains or prevent the ubiquitination from substrate proteins such as MDM2 (15Tavana O. Gu W. Modulation of the p53/MDM2 interplay by HAUSP inhibitors.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2017; 9 (27927749): 45-5210.1093/jmcb/mjw049Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), CDC25A (16Biswas K. Philip S.

Invest. 2016; 126 (27183383): 2205-222010.1172/JCI85747Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To find out whether USP7 modulates Maf ubiquitination, we first evaluated the ubiquitination levels of Maf proteins in HEK293T cells by co-transfecting both USP7 and Maf plasmids, followed by a co-IP/IB assay. As shown in Fig. 3, A–C, all three Maf proteins were heavily polyubiquitinated in the overexpression of Ub. However, USP7 markedly reduced the polyubiquitination levels of the Maf proteins (Fig. 3, A–C). This finding was confirmed in MM cells. Lentivirus-mediated USP7 markedly decreased the ubiquitination levels of MafB in RPMI-8226 and LP1 cells (using an anti-MafB antibody for immunoprecipitation, see Fig. 3D). Similarly, c-Maf ubiquitination was decreased by lentiviral USP7 in MM cells (using an anti-c-Maf antibody for immunoprecipitation, see Fig. 3E). To further confirm this finding, MafB ubiquitination was measured in HEK293T cells by knocking down USP7 with its specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 3F, the MafB polyubiquitination level was decreased by USP7, but it was increased when USP7 was knocked down. These results thus concluded that USP7 prevents the polyubiquitination levels of Maf proteins in MM cells. The above results demonstrated that USP7 interacts with Maf proteins and prevents their polyubiquitination. Because typical polyubiquitination might lead to protein degradation, we next wondered whether USP7 increased Maf protein stability. To this end, the USP7 plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with MafB, c-Maf, or MafA followed by IB assays. The results showed that USP7 significantly increased the protein levels of MafB (Fig. 4A), c-Maf (Fig. 4B), and MafA (Fig. 4C) in a concentration-dependent manner. These results were further confirmed by CHX chase assays as shown in Fig. 4, D–F. When de novo synthesis of Maf proteins was inhibited by CHX, USP7 significantly slowed down Maf degradation and prolonged their half-lives. Notably, knockdown of USP7 led to decreased Maf proteins in MM cell lines (Fig. 4, G–I). To find out whether Maf down-regulation by USP7 was via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway, two siUSP7 sequences were introduced into MM cells followed by treatment of MG132, a typical proteasome inhibitor. The results showed that a marked decrease was seen in both c-Maf and MafB proteins when USP7 was knocked down, but this decrease were strikingly reversed by MG132 (Fig. 4J). Therefore, all the above investigations demonstrated that USP7 prevents Maf protein ubiquitination and increases their stability. Maf proteins are key transcription factors that up-regulate the gene expression by activating the promoters of specific target genes, including CCND2, ITGB7, and ARK5 via the specific recognition element (20Suzuki A. Iida S. Kato-Uranishi M. Tajima E. Zhan F. Hanamura I. Huang Y. Ogura T. Takahashi S. Ueda R. Barlogie B. Shaughnessy Jr, J. Esumi H. ARK5 is transcriptionally regulated by the large-MAF family and mediates IGF-1–induced cell invasion in multiple myeloma: ARK5 as a new molecular determinant of malignant multiple myeloma.Oncogene. 2005; 24 (16044163): 6936-694410.1038/sj.onc.1208844Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21Lu J.

The above studies demonstrated that USP7 stabilized the Maf protein, and therefore, we wondered whether USP7 promoted Maf transcriptional activity. To this end, a MARE-driving firefly luciferase reporter (MARE.Luci) was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with MafB in the presence or absence of a USP7 plasmid for 24 h before being subjected to luciferase assays (14Du Y. Liu Y. Xu Y. Juan J. Zhang Z. Xu Z. Cao B. Wang Q. Zeng Y. Mao X. The transmembrane protein TMEPAI induces myeloma cell apoptosis by promoting degradation of the c-Maf transcription factor.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5A, MafB up-regulated luciferase activity, and it was strikingly increased by the addition of USP7, suggesting that USP7 promoted MafB transcriptional activity. Similar findings were found in c-Maf. As shown in Fig. 5B, in the presence of USP7, the transcriptional activity of c-Maf was also markedly increased. Moreover, both ITGB7 and CCND2, two representative genes regulated by Maf proteins, were induced by USP7 (Fig. 5C). In contrast, when USP7 was knocked down by siUSP7 from the MM cell line RPMI-8226, the expression of these two genes was accordingly down-regulated (Fig. 5D). These results thus concluded that USP7 enhances Maf proteins transcriptional activity by preventing their degradation. The aforementioned studies have shown that USP7 stabilizes Maf proteins and promotes their oncogenic transcriptional activity. Therefore, we wondered whether USP7 was also important in MM pathophysiology. To this end, the expression profile of USP7 was evaluated in plasma cells from healthy donors (HD), patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and myeloma patients by using the public cancer database (22Zhan F. Barlogie B. Arzoumanian V. Huang Y. Williams D.R. Hollmig K. Pineda-Roman M. Tricot G. van Rhee F. Zangari M. Dhodapkar M. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Gene-expression signature of benign monoclonal gammopathy evident in multiple myeloma is linked to good prognosis.Blood. 2007; 109 (17023574): 1692-170010.1182/blood-2006-07-037077Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The result revealed that the USP7 expression levels were significantly increased in MGUS and MM cells compared with that in the HD controls (Fig. 6A). This observation was verified in bone marrow cells from HD and MM patients using RT-PCR. The result showed that USP7 was significantly increased in MM patients (Fig. 6B). These findings indicated USP7 expression is highly associated with myeloma progression. To predict the clinical relevance of USP7 in MM patients, the correlation between USP7 expression levels and the overall survival and event-free survival time was analyzed (22Zhan F. Barlogie B. Arzoumanian V. Huang Y. Williams D.R. Hollmig K. Pineda-Roman M. Tricot G. van Rhee F. Zangari M. Dhodapkar M. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Gene-expression signature of benign monoclonal gammopathy evident in multiple myeloma is linked to good prognosis.Blood. 2007; 109 (17023574): 1692-170010.1182/blood-2006-07-037077Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, USP7 expression was negatively related to both events-free survival and overall survival time of MM patients. These results suggested that USP7 probably promotes MM cell survival by stabilizing Maf proteins. Subsequently, we measured MM cell survival using RPMI-8226 and OCI-MY5 as the model cells after being infected with lentiviral USP7. As shown in Fig. 6, E and F, the viability of MM cells was markedly increased following the ectopic expression of USP7. Consistent with this finding, knockdown of USP7 by its specific siRNA led to significant reduction of MM cell viability (Fig. 6, G and H). All these results thus demonstrated that USP7 promotes MM cell survival, and it predicts poor outcome of MM patients. Because USP7 increases MM cell viability and contributes to the poor outcome of MM patients, we wondered whether inhibition of USP7 could mediate MM cell apoptosis by degrading Maf proteins. To this end, P5091 (Fig. 7A), a small molecule inhibitor of USP7 (23Chauhan D. Tian Z. Nicholson B. Kumar K.G. Zhou B. Carrasco R. McDermott J.L. Leach C.A. Fulcinniti M. Kodrasov M.P. Weinstock J. Kingsbury W.D. Hideshima T. Shah P.K.

We first measured the effects of P5091 on Maf protein ubiquitination in MM cells. As shown in Fig. 7, B and C, P5091 significantly increased the polyubiquitination levels of both MafB and c-Maf in MM cells. Moreover, when cells were transfected with MafB, Ub, and/or USP7 plasmids followed by P5091 treatment, the IP/IB assay showed that the decreased polyubiquitination levels on MafB by USP7 were markedly increased by P5091 (data not shown). In accordance with these findings, P5091 suppressed the transcriptional activity of c-Maf and MafB that were up-regulated by USP7 (Fig. 7D). Because Maf proteins are key factors in myelomagenesis, we wondered whether P5091-induced MM cell apoptosis was Maf-dependent. To this end, MafB-expressing (RPMI-8226 and LP1) and c-Maf–expressing (RPMI-8226 and OCI-MY5) cell lines as well KMS11 cells with a low expression of c-Maf (4Qiang Y.W. Ye S. Chen Y. Buros A.F.

MAF protein mediates innate resistance to proteasome inhibition therapy in multiple myeloma.Blood. 2016; 128 (27793878): 2919-293010.1182/blood-2016-03-706077Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and lacking MafB (Fig. 1) were treated with P5091, followed by IB assays. The results showed that P5091 decreased the protein levels of MafB and c-Maf in a concentration-dependent manner in the cell lines of RPMI-8226, LP1 (Fig. 7E), and OCI-MY5 (Fig. 7F) but not in KMS11 (Fig. 7G). Notably, the changes on Maf proteins were associated with the cleavage of PARP, the down-regulation of prosurvival Mcl-1, and the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax in RPMI-8226, LP1, and OCI-MY5 cells, but P5091 did not show a marked decrease of c-Maf and less PARP cleavage in KMS11 (Fig. 7, E–G), suggesting that Maf protein degradation is associated with MM cell apoptosis induced by P5091. Previous studies have demonstrated that USP7 can also stabilize MDM2 (24Kon N. Kobayashi Y. Li M. Brooks C.L. Ludwig T. Gu W. Inactivation of HAUSP in vivo modulates p53 function.Oncogene. 2010; 29 (19946331): 1270-127910.1038/onc.2009.427Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), a ubiquitin ligase of p53. P5091 was proposed to induce MM cell apoptosis by inhibiting the USP7/MDM2/p53 axle (23Chauhan D. Tian Z. Nicholson B. Kumar K.G. Zhou B. Carrasco R. McDermott J.L. Leach C.A. Fulcinniti M.

However, p53 mutation is frequently seen in late stage MM, and their expression levels and mutation status are also diverse. For example, LP1 expresses WT p53, but RPMI-8226 and OCI-MY5 harbor mutated p53, and KMS11 expresses null or weak p53 (25Ling X. Calinski D. Chanan-Khan A.A. Zhou M. Li F.

To find out the effects of p53 in the treatment of P5091 on MM, the above MM cell lines were treated with P5091 followed by IB assays for p53. As shown in Fig. 7E, P5091 up-regulated the expression of p53 in both RPMI-8226 and LP1 cells in association with PARP cleavage, but p53 was not markedly affected by P5091 in OCI-MY5 (Fig. 7F), although OCI-MY5 cells underwent PARP cleavage.

A polyphasic approach based on viable counting, PCR-DGGE and metagenomic 16S rRNA gene amplicon target sequencing was applied. Two different H. illucens groups were reared on coffee by-products (C) or a mixture of vegetables (S). Viable counts showed a wide variability based on substrate. PCR-DGGE and Illumina sequencing allowed the major and minor bacterial taxa to be detected. Both samples of larvae and their frass reared on the S substrate showed the highest richness and evenness of bacterial communities, whereas zebrafish (ZHC) fed H. illucens reared on substrate C and zebrafish (ZHS) fed H. illucens reared on substrate S had the lowest bacterial richness and evenness. A stimulating effect of bioactive compounds from coffee by-products on the occurrence of Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostoccaceae in H. illucens reared on substrate C has been hypothesized. Zebrafish gut samples originating from the two feeding trials showed complex microbial patterns in which Actinobacteria and Alteromonadales were always detected, irrespective of the diet used. Enterobacteriaceae in fish guts were more abundant in ZHS than in ZHC, thus suggesting an influence of the bioactive compounds (chlorogenic and caffeic acids) in the substrate on Enterobacteriaceae in fish guts. ZHC showed a higher abundance of Clostridia than did ZHS, which was likely explained by stimulating activity on the bacteria in this class by the bioactive compounds contained in H. illucens reared on substrate C. An influence of the microbiota of H. illucens or insect-derived bioactive compounds on the gut microbiota of zebrafish has been suggested. The presence of bacteria consistently associated with zebrafish guts has been found irrespective of the diet, thus attesting to the likely stability of the core fish microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2996432997,"The histone deacetylase sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) regulates numerous biological functions, including transcriptional repression, DNA repair, and telomere maintenance. Recombinant SIRT6 displays catalytic efficiencies 2 orders of magnitude greater for long-chain deacylation than deacetylation against peptide substrates; however, deacetylation can be enhanced by allosteric small-molecule activators. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of activated lysine deacetylation and enhanced long-chain acyl-group removal by SIRT6. Activity-based screening identified compounds that activated histone peptide deacetylation 18-48-fold. Chemical optimization based on structure–activity relationships yielded an activator with improved potency and selectivity for SIRT6. Using this novel activator, we conducted biochemical and kinetic analyses revealing that SIRT6 is activated via acceleration of a catalytic step occurring after substrate binding but before NAD + cleavage. We identified a SIRT6 variant, R65A, that maintains basal deacetylase activity but cannot be activated and failed to enhance long-chain deacylation. Additional biochemical studies revealed that Arg-65 is critical for activation by facilitating a conformational step that initiates chemical catalysis. This work suggests that SIRT6 activation of deacetylation involves a similar mechanism to improved catalysis as that of long-chain deacylation. The identification of novel SIRT6 activators and the molecular insights into activation and catalysis presented here provide a foundational understanding for physiological SIRT6 activation and for rational design of activating molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2995580622,"The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system has enhanced the development of genetically engineered animals for use in xenotransplantation. Potential limitations to the CRISPR/Cas9 system impacting the development of genetically engineered cells and animals include the creation of off-target mutations. We sought to develop a method to reduce the likelihood of off-target mutation while maintaining a high efficiency rate of desired genetic mutations for the GGTA1 gene. Extension of sgRNA length, responsible for recognition of the target DNA sequence for Cas9 cleavage, resulted in improved specificity for the GGTA1 gene and less off-target DNA cleavage. Three PAM sites were selected within exon 1 of the porcine GGTA1 gene and ten sgRNA of variable lengths were designed across these three sites. The sgRNA was tested against synthetic double stranded DNA templates replicating both the native GGTA1 DNA template and the two most likely off-target binding sites in the porcine genome. Cleavage ability for native and off-target DNA was determined by in vitro cleavage assays. Resulting cleavage products were analyzed to determine the cleavage efficiency of the Cas9/sgRNA complex. Extension of sgRNA length did not have a statistical impact on the specificity of the Cas9/sgRNA complex for PAM1 and PAM2 sites. At the PAM3 site, however, an observed increase in specificity for native versus off-target templates was seen with increased sgRNA length. In addition, distance between PAM site and the start codon had a significant impact on cleavage efficiency and target specificity, regardless of sgRNA length. Although the in vitro assays showed off-target cleavage, Sanger sequencing revealed that no off-target mutations were found in GGTA1 knockout cell lines or piglet. These results demonstrate an optimized method for improvement of the CRIPSR/Cas9 gene editing system by reducing the likelihood of damaging off-target mutations in GGTA1 knocked out cells destined for xenotransplant donor production."

From among the factors which were considered significant in previous studies, we decided to include the following in our research: empathy, self-esteem, self-efficacy and loneliness. Additionally, we wanted to examine which predictors have a direct or indirect effect on PVG in female and male emerging adult gamers group. Including a sample of 370 video game players (201 female gamers) aged 18–30 years (M = 21.66 years, SD = 2.83) participated in this study and were asked to complete self-report measures. The questionnaires included: Problem Videogame Playing Questionnaire, The Interpersonal Reactivity Index, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale. Our results indicate that empathy dimension associated with personal distress, the time spent playing computer games per week is directly associated with PVG. Also, there were found full mediation between self-esteem, loneliness, self-efficacy and PVG via personal distress in emerging adult male gamers group. In emerging adult female gamers group personal distress fully mediated relation between self-esteem, self-efficacy and PVG. Our findings indicate that the time spent playing video games, as well as personal distress as a function of self-esteem, loneliness and self-efficacy, are predictors of problematic video gaming. Additionally, our results may lead to a better understanding of PVG among emerging adults. In particular, they may point to the importance of personal distress in relation to PVG during emerging adulthood, which is a developmental stage of many changes in social and professional life."
https://openalex.org/W2995749259,"Abstract Nuclear import, mediated in part by karyopherin-α (KPNA)/importin-α subtypes, regulates transcription factor access to the genome and determines cell fate. However, the cancer-specific changes of KPNA subtypes and the relevancy in cancer biology remain largely unknown. Here, we report that KPNA4 , encoding karyopherin-α4 (KPNA4), is exclusively amplified and overexpressed in head and neck of squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Depletion of KPNA4 attenuated nuclear localization signal-dependent transport activity and suppressed malignant phenotypes and induced epidermal differentiation. Mechanistically, KPNA4-mediated nuclear transport of Ras-responsive element-binding protein (RREB1), which sustains Ras/ERK pathway signaling through repressing miR-143/145 expression. Notably, MAPK signaling enhanced trafficking activity of KPNA4 via phosphorylation of KPNA4 at Ser60. These data reveal that KPNA4 establishes a feed-forward cascade that potentiates Ras/ERK signaling in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W2996247621,"Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard care for prostate cancer (PCa) patients who fail surgery or radiotherapy. While initially effective, the cancer almost always recurs as a more aggressive castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Previous studies have demonstrated that chromatin modifying enzymes can play a critical role in the conversion to CRPC. However, only a handful of these potential pharmacological targets have been tested. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a focused shRNA screen of chromatin modifying enzymes previously shown to be involved in cellular differentiation. We found that altering the balance between histone methylation and demethylation impacted growth and proliferation. Of all genes tested, KDM3B, a histone H3K9 demethylase, was found to have the most antiproliferative effect. These results were phenocopied with a KDM3B CRISPR/Cas9 knockout. When tested in several PCa cell lines, the decrease in proliferation was remarkably specific to androgen-independent cells. Genetic rescue experiments showed that only the enzymatically active KDM3B could recover the phenotype. Surprisingly, despite the decreased proliferation of androgen-independent cell no alterations in the cell cycle distribution were observed following KDM3B knockdown. Whole transcriptome analyses revealed changes in the gene expression profile following loss of KDM3B, including downregulation of metabolic enzymes such as ARG2 and RDH11. Metabolomic analysis of KDM3B knockout showed a decrease in several critical amino acids. Overall, our work reveals, for the first time, the specificity and the dependence of KDM3B in CRPC proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2995200768,"The tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a serine/threonine phosphatase whose activity is inhibited in most human cancers. One of the best-characterized PP2A substrates is MYC proto-oncogene basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor (MYC), whose overexpression is commonly associated with aggressive forms of this disease. PP2A directly dephosphorylates MYC, resulting in its degradation. To explore the therapeutic potential of direct PP2A activation in a diverse set of MYC-driven cancers, here we used biochemical assays, recombinant cell lines, gene expression analyses, and immunohistochemistry to evaluate a series of first-in-class small-molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs) in Burkitt lymphoma, KRAS-driven non–small cell lung cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer. In all tested models of MYC-driven cancer, the SMAP treatment rapidly and persistently inhibited MYC expression through proteasome-mediated degradation, inhibition of MYC transcriptional activity, decreased cancer cell proliferation, and tumor growth inhibition. Importantly, we generated a series of cell lines expressing PP2A-dependent phosphodegron variants of MYC and demonstrated that the antitumorigenic activity of SMAPs depends on MYC degradation. Collectively, the findings presented here indicate a pharmacologically tractable approach to drive MYC degradation by using SMAPs for the management of a broad range of MYC-driven cancers."

MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells) have multidirectional differentiation potential and are closely related to fracture healing. This study was to explore the effects of PTH1-34 on proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells and MSCs in vitro, and on angiogenesis, and MSCs migration during fracture healing in vivo.Mice with stabilized fracture were assigned to 4 groups: CON, PTH (PTH1-34 40 μg/kg/day), MSC (transplanted with 105 MSCs), PTH+MSCs. Mice were sacrificed 14 days after fracture, and callus tissues were harvested for microCT scan and immunohistochemistry analysis. The effects of PTH1-34 on angiogenesis, and MSCs differentiation and migration were assessed by wound healing, tube formation and immunofluorescence staining.Treatment with either PTH1-34, or MSCs promoted bone healing and vascular formation in fracture callus. The callus bone mass, bone volume, and bone mineral density were all greater in PTH and/or MSC groups than they were in CON (p<0.05). PTH1-34 increased small vessels formation (diameter ≤50μm), whereas MSCs increased the large ones (diameter >50μm). Expression of CD31 within calluses and trabecular bones were significantly higher in PTH1-34 treated group than that of not (p<0.05). Expression of CD31, VEGFR, VEGFR2, and vWF was upregulated, and wound healing and tube formation were increased in MSCs treated with PTH1-34 compared to that of control.PTH1-34 improved the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells and MSCs, enhancing migration of MSCs to bone callus to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis, and facilitating fracture healing."

DIF outside of the month of Ramadan was performed to evaluate the effect of DIF in the absence of the way of life accompanying Ramadan. Methods Twelve healthy male volunteers with a mean age of 25.1 ± 2.5 years arrived to the sleep laboratory on 4 times: 1) adaptation, 5 weeks before Ramadan; 2) 4 weeks before Ramadan while performing DIF for 1 week (fasting outside of Ramadan; FOR); 3) 1 week before Ramadan (non-fasting baseline; non-fasting BL); and 4) After completing 2 weeks of Ramadan while performing DIF. Plasma levels of cytokines were assessed using enzyme-linked immunoassays at 22:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, and 11:00. Results During DIF, there was a significant decrease in the levels of cytokines, particularly, IL-1β and IL-6, in most measurements compared to non-fasting BL. This reduction was more obvious during the FOR period. There were no significant changes in the circadian phase of the measured cytokines reflected by the acrophase of the measured variables during fasting (FOR and Ramadan) compared to non-fasting BL. Conclusion Under controlled conditions, DIF led to significantly decreased plasma levels of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8), particularly IL-1β and IL-6 across 24 h. DIF had no effect on the circadian patterns of the measured cytokines as shown by cosinor analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2995359348,"One of the major goals of drug use prevention programs is to delay the age of onset of substance use. What is called early initiation, usually occurring in adolescents under the age of 15, is a salient predictor of Substance Use Disorders later in adulthood. The causes of early initiation are complex and multifaceted and this has led to the identification of a rich set of risk and protective factors that influence age of onset. Nonetheless, there is little knowledge about the interdependence of these factors in their impact on early initiation. This paper addresses this question by applying Multiple Correspondence Analysis to data on family, community and social risk and protective factors from over 1200 adolescents. We find that community and to a lesser extent social factors are the most clearly associated to early initiation and we compare our results to those obtained from linear regression analyses of the same data that do not incorporate interdependence and find opposite results. We discuss the differences between linear regressions and MCA to evaluate the interplay of risk and protective factors and the implications of our findings for health policy and the design of prevention interventions aimed at delaying age of onset."

We focused on the following phospholipids that have amino groups as the functional group: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Lyso-PE, phosphatidylserine, and Lyso-phosphatidylserine. We also investigated fatty acids that have a carboxy group. A sixplex tandem mass tag (TMT) was used for the isobaric tagging method in this study. The TMT reaction had high reproducibility in human plasma. A total of 196 human plasma samples from three AD cohorts were used for the study, and compared to pooled plasma quality control (QC) samples. The described method required only 40 MRM measurements, including the pooled QC samples, for a full comparison of the data. We found that the content of free fatty acids increased in AD samples in all the three cohorts, alkenyl PEs (ePEs) decreased over a one-year interval in AD patients, and ePEs weakly correlated with amyloid peptide (a-beta) 1-42 in cerebrospinal fluid. In conclusion, total free fatty acids in plasma are a risk factor for AD, and ePEs monitor candidates for AD. Therefore, TMT-lipidomics is a powerful approach for the determination of plasma biomarkers because of the high sample throughput."
https://openalex.org/W2996567330,"The rising prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) over the past decades has been linked to lifestyle changes, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Recent findings point to gut-associated mechanisms in the control of T1D pathogenesis. In nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of T1D, diabetes development accelerates after deletion of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We hypothesized that altered intestinal functions contribute to metabolic alterations, which favor accelerated diabetes development in TLR4-deficient (TLR4 −/− ) NOD mice. In 70–90-day-old normoglycemic (prediabetic) female NOD TLR4 +/+ and NOD TLR4 −/− mice, gut morphology and microbiome composition were analyzed. Parameters of lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and mitochondrial respiratory activity were measured in vivo and ex vivo . Compared with NOD TLR4 +/+ mice, NOD TLR4 −/− animals showed lower muscle mass of the small intestine, higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, and lower Firmicutes in the large intestine, along with lower levels of circulating short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These changes are associated with higher body weight, hyperlipidemia, and severe insulin and glucose intolerance, all occurring before the onset of diabetes. These mice also exhibited insulin resistance–related abnormalities of energy metabolism, such as lower total respiratory exchange rates and higher hepatic oxidative capacity. Distinct alterations of gut morphology and microbiota composition associated with reduction of circulating SCFA may contribute to metabolic disorders promoting the progression of insulin-deficient diabetes/T1D development."
https://openalex.org/W2996579713,"Background Metformin treatment (1000–2000 mg/day) over 6 months in pubertal children and/or adolescents with obesity and hyperinsulinism is associated with a reduction in body mass index (BMI) and the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR). We aimed to ascertain if long-term treatment (24 months) with lower doses of metformin (850 mg/day) normalizes the endocrine-metabolic abnormalities, improves body composition, and reduces the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in pre-puberal and early pubertal children with obesity. Methods A pilot double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 18 pre-puberal and early pubertal (Tanner stage I-II) children with obesity and risk markers for metabolic syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive metformin (850 mg/day) or placebo for 24 months. Clinical, biochemical (insulin, lipids, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]), and imaging (body composition [dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and magnetic resonance imaging]) parameters as well as cIMT (ultrasonography) were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months. Results The 12-month treatment tend to cause a reduction in weight standard deviation scores (SDS), BMI-SDS, leptin, leptin–to–high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin ratio, hsCRP, cIMT, fat mass, and liver fat in metformin-treated children compared with placebo. The effect of metformin on the reduction of BMI-SDS, leptin, leptin-to-HMW adiponectin ratio, hsCRP, and liver fat seemed to be maintained after completing the 24 months of treatment. No changes in insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR) or adverse effects were detected. Conclusion In this pilot study, metformin treatment in pre-puberal and early pubertal children with obesity seemed to improve body composition and inflammation markers. Our data encourage the development of future fully powered trials using 850 mg/day metformin in young children, highlighting its excellent tolerance and potential long-term benefits."

The objective of this study was to analyse the predictive power of sociodemographic variables, empathy (cognitive and emotional), and social dominance orientation (social dominance and opposition to equality) on teachers’ attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion by comparing linear relationship models and models based on fuzzy-set comparative qualitative analysis. The sample consisted of 268 teachers of different educational levels aged between 20 and 64 years (M = 42.46, SD = 9.22), 66% of whom were women. The teachers were administered the Sentiments, Attitudes, and Concerns about Inclusive Education Revised (SACIE-R) scale, the Basic Empathy Scale (BES), and the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scale. Two different statistical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) models. The results of the regression models suggest that social dominance is the main predictor of attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Social dominance is negatively related to attitudes and positively related to sentiments and concerns. Only opposition to equality and emotional empathy are related to attitudes. On the other hand, the results of the QCA models suggest that low social dominance and high cognitive and emotional empathy, as well as female sex, predict higher levels of positive attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Since teachers interact most with students, it is important to be aware of how their empathy and social dominance orientations influence inclusion to develop intervention programmes that seek to train teachers in these capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2995889831,"Protein arginine methyltransferase-5 (PRMT5) is overexpressed in aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and supports constitutive expression of CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC. Here, we combined ChIP analysis with next-generation sequencing to identify microRNA (miRNA) genes that are targeted by PRMT5 in aggressive lymphoma cell lines. We identified enrichment of histone 3 dimethylation at Arg-8 (H3(Me2)R8) in the promoter regions of miR33b, miR96, and miR503. PRMT5 knockdown de-repressed transcription of all three miRNAs, accompanied by loss of recruitment of epigenetic repressor complexes containing PRMT5 and either histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) or HDAC3, enhanced binding of co-activator complexes containing p300 or CREB-binding protein (CBP), and increased acetylation of specific histones, including H2BK12, H3K9, H3K14, and H4K8 at the miRNA promoters. Re-expression of individual miRNAs in B-cell lymphoma cells down-regulated expression of PRMT5, CYCLIN D1, and c-MYC, which are all predicted targets of these miRNAs, and reduced lymphoma cell survival. Luciferase reporter assays with WT and mutant 3′UTRs of CYCLIN D1 and c-MYC mRNAs revealed that binding sites for miR33b, miR96, and miR503 are critical for translational regulation of the transcripts of these two genes. Our findings link altered PRMT5 expression to transcriptional silencing of tumor-suppressing miRNAs in lymphoma cells and reinforce PRMT5's relevance for promoting lymphoma cell growth and survival."

https://openalex.org/W2995858217,"A goal of tracking migratory animals is to characterize the habitats they use and to interpret population processes with respect to conditions experienced en route to, and within, overwintering areas. For migratory seabirds with broad breeding ranges, inferring population-level effects of environmental conditions that are experienced during migratory periods would benefit by directly comparing how birds from different breeding aggregations disperse, characterizing the physical conditions of areas they use, and determining whether they occupy shared foraging areas. We therefore tracked 41 adult and juvenile chinstrap penguins (Pygoscelis antarctica) from three breeding locations in the northern Antarctic Peninsula region during the austral winter of 2017. The satellite tracking data revealed overlap of individuals over continental shelf areas during autumn months (Mar-May), shared outbound corridors that track the southern Antarctic circumpolar current front, followed by occupancy of progressively colder, deeper, and ice-free waters that spanned the entire western hemisphere south of the Polar Front. Despite broadly similar physical environments used by individuals from different colonies, the proportion of birds from each colony that remained within 500km of their colony was positively correlated with their local population trends. This suggests that local migration strategies near the Antarctic Peninsula may benefit breeding populations. However, the magnitude of inter-colony and intra-colony overlap was generally low given the broad scale of habitats occupied. High individual variation in winter movements suggests that habitat selection among chinstrap penguins is more opportunistic, without clear colony-specific preference for fine-scale foraging hotspots. Mixing of individuals from multiple colonies across broad regions of the Southern Ocean would expose chinstrap penguins from the Antarctic Peninsula to a shared environmental experience that helps explain the regional decline in their abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2995180944,"Objectives The aim of the study was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of a single intra-articular injection of 2.0% non-chemically modified sodium hyaluronate (SH) vs 0.8% hylan G-F 20 (control) in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Design This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in patients with painful tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (American College of Rheumatology criteria) with insufficient response or intolerance to first-line analgesics and regular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Subjects received a single intra-articular injection of either SH or hylan G-F 20. The primary outcome was the 6-month change from baseline in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index pain subscale (WOMAC A), with a pre-specified lower margin for non-inferiority of 8 mm. Results Of the 292 patients randomized (SH: 144), 288 received an injection (SH: 142), 266 completed the study (SH: 134). In the Per Protocol dataset (SH: 113, control: 112), the WOMAC A change at 6 months was -34.3 mm (95% confidence interval (CI): -37.8, -30.8) and -36.2 mm (95% CI: -40.3, -32.1) for the SH and hylan G-F 20 patients, respectively (P = 0.5). The intergroup difference was -1.9 mm (95% CI: -7.3, 3.5). Results were similar in the Full Analysis Set (SH: 139, control: 141) with a difference between the groups of -2.9 mm (95% CI: -7.9, 2.2). A total of 31.3% of the injected patients reported a treatment-emergent adverse event, including injection site reactions (pain, inflammation or effusion) which occurred in 8.5% of the SH patients vs 13.0% of the hylan G-F 20 patients. No serious reactions were reported. Conclusions This clinical trial demonstrated the non-inferiority of a single intra-articular injection of SH vs hylan G-F 20 on the WOMAC A change from baseline at 6 months."

https://openalex.org/W2993005027,"Background HCV incidence is increasing in the US, notably among younger people who inject drugs (PWID). In a cohort of young adult (age<30 years) PWID in San Francisco we examined whether ‘injecting partner mixing’ factors, i.e. age of partner and knowledge of their HCV serostatus, were associated with HCV transmission. Methods In 448 susceptible PWID studied prospectively. All participants were asked to report characteristics and behaviors they engaged in with up to 3 injecting partners defined as “people whom you injected the most with” in the past month”. These partnerships did not specify that drugs or injecting equipment was shared. HCV incidence was estimated by age of up to 3 injecting partners, categorized as: (i) all <30; (ii) mixed-age (<&≥30); and (iii) all ≥30 years and perceived knowledge of the HCV status of participants’ injecting partners’ HCV status. Interaction was evaluated between partnership age categories and perceived HCV status of partners. Results Between 2006–2018, overall HCV incidence (/100 person years observation [pyo]) was 19.4 (95% CI: 16.4, 22.9). Incidence was highest in those with mixed-age partnerships: 28.5 (95% CI: 21.8, 37.1) and those whose partners were all <30 (23.9; 95% CI: 18.8, 30.4), and lowest if partners were ≥30 (7.5; 95% CI: 4.8, 11.8). In a multivariable analyses adjusting for age, sex (of index), injection frequency, and injection partnership ‘monogamy’, we found evidence for an interaction: the highest HCV incidence was seen in PWID whose partners were all <30 and who knew at least one of their partners was HCV-positive (58.9, 95% CI: 43.3, 80.0; p<0.01). Conclusions Younger injectors are more likely to acquire HCV from their similarly-aged peers, than older injecting partners. Protective seroadaptive behavior may contribute to reduce incidence. These findings can inform new HCV prevention approaches for young PWID needed to curb the HCV epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2994117479,"Background Management of cardiac arrest patients includes active body temperature control and strict prevention of fever to avoid further neurological damage. Cold-shock proteins RNA-binding motif 3 (RBM3) and cold inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) expressions are induced in vitro in response to hypothermia and play a key role in hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. Objective To measure gene expressions of RBM3, CIRP, and inflammatory biomarkers in whole blood samples from targeted temperature management (TTM)-treated post-cardiac arrest patients for the potential application as clinical biomarkers for the efficacy of TTM treatment. Methods A prospective single center trial with the inclusion of 22 cardiac arrest patients who were treated with TTM (33°C for 24 hours) after ROSC was performed. RBM3, CIRP, interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expressions were quantified by RT-qPCR. Serum RBM3 protein concentration was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results RBM3 mRNA expression was significantly induced in post-cardiac arrest patients in response to TTM. RBM3 mRNA was increased 2.2-fold compared to before TTM. A similar expression kinetic of 1.4-fold increase was observed for CIRP mRNA, but did not reached significancy. Serum RBM3 protein was not increased in response to TTM. IL-6 and MCP-1 expression peaked after ROSC and then significantly decreased. iNOS expression was significantly increased 24h after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and TTM. Conclusions RBM3 is temperature regulated in patients treated with TTM after CA and ROSC. RBM3 is a possible biomarker candidate to ensure the efficacy of TTM treatment in post-cardiac arrest patients and its pharmacological induction could be a potential future intervention strategy that warrants further research."

https://openalex.org/W2996112070,"Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are conspicuous neuron-specific substructures within the extracellular matrix of the central nervous system that have generated an explosion of interest over the last decade. These reticulated structures appear to surround synapses on the cell bodies of a subset of the neurons in the central nervous system and play key roles in both developmental and adult-brain plasticity. Despite the interest in these structures and compelling demonstrations of their importance in regulating plasticity, their precise functional mechanisms remain elusive. The limited mechanistic understanding of PNNs is primarily because of an incomplete knowledge of their molecular composition and structure and a failure to identify PNN-specific targets. Thus, it has been challenging to precisely manipulate PNNs to rigorously investigate their function. Here, using mouse models and neuronal cultures, we demonstrate a role of receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase zeta (RPTPζ) in PNN structure. We found that in the absence of RPTPζ, the reticular structure of PNNs is lost and phenocopies the PNN structural abnormalities observed in tenascin-R knockout brains. Furthermore, we biochemically analyzed the contribution of RPTPζ to PNN formation and structure, which enabled us to generate a more detailed model for PNNs. We provide evidence for two distinct kinds of interactions of PNN components with the neuronal surface, one dependent on RPTPζ and the other requiring the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan. We propose that these findings offer important insight into PNN structure and lay important groundwork for future strategies to specifically disrupt PNNs to precisely dissect their function."
https://openalex.org/W2995239701,"Type 1, or autoimmune, diabetes is caused by the T-cell mediated destruction of the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously develop autoimmune diabetes akin to human type 1 diabetes. For this reason, the NOD mouse has been the preeminent murine model for human type 1 diabetes research for several decades. However, humanized mouse models are highly sought after because they offer both the experimental tractability of a mouse model and the clinical relevance of human-based research. Autoimmune T-cell responses against insulin, and its precursor proinsulin, play central roles in the autoimmune responses against pancreatic beta cells in both humans and NOD mice. As a first step towards developing a murine model of the human autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells we set out to replace the murine insulin 1 gene (Ins1) with the human insulin gene (Ins) using CRISPR/Cas9. Here we describe a NOD mouse strain that expresses human insulin in place of murine insulin 1, referred to as HuPI. HuPI mice express human insulin, and C-peptide, in their serum and pancreata and have normal glucose tolerance. Compared with wild type NOD mice, the incidence of diabetes is much lower in HuPI mice. Only 15-20% of HuPI mice developed diabetes after 300 days, compared to more than 60% of unmodified NOD mice. Immune-cell infiltration into the pancreatic islets of HuPI mice was not detectable at 100 days but was clearly evident by 300 days. This work highlights the feasibility of using CRISPR/Cas9 to create mouse models of human diseases that express proteins pivotal to the human disease. Furthermore, it reveals that even subtle changes in proinsulin protect NOD mice from diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2996647957,"McrBC is a two-component, modification-dependent restriction system that cleaves foreign DNA-containing methylated cytosines. Previous crystallographic studies have shown that Escherichia coli McrB uses a base-flipping mechanism to recognize these modified substrates with high affinity. The side chains stabilizing both the flipped base and the distorted duplex are poorly conserved among McrB homologs, suggesting that other mechanisms may exist for binding modified DNA. Here we present the structures of the Thermococcus gammatolerans McrB DNA-binding domain (TgΔ185) both alone and in complex with a methylated DNA substrate at 1.68 and 2.27 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that TgΔ185 consists of a YT521-B homology (YTH) domain, which is commonly found in eukaryotic proteins that bind methylated RNA and is structurally unrelated to the E. coli McrB DNA-binding domain. Structural superposition and co-crystallization further show that TgΔ185 shares a conserved aromatic cage with other YTH domains, which forms the binding pocket for a flipped-out base. Mutational analysis of this aromatic cage supports its role in conferring specificity for the methylated adenines, whereas an extended basic surface present in TgΔ185 facilitates its preferential binding to duplex DNA rather than RNA. Together, these findings establish a new binding mode and specificity among McrB homologs and expand the biological roles of YTH domains."

Clinicopathological factors of primary tumors were reviewed to identify the factors affecting engraftment success rates. After the establishment of PDX models, we performed olaparib and carboplatin chemosensitivity tests. We used PDX models from triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or germline BRCA1 mutations in chemosensitivity tests.The univariate analyses (p<0.05) showed factors which were significantly associated with successful engraftment of PDX models include poor histologic grade, presence of BRCA mutation, aggressive diseases, and death. Factors which were independently associated with successful engraftment of PDX models on multivariate analyses include poor histologic grade and aggressive diseases status. In chemosensitivity tests, a PDX model with the BRCA1 L1780P mutation showed partial response to olaparib and complete response to carboplatin.Successful engraftment of PDX models was significantly associated with aggressive diseases. Patients who have aggressive diseases status, large tumors, and poor histologic grade are ideal candidates for developing successful PDX models. Chemosensitivity tests using the PDX models provide additional information about alternative treatment strategies for residual TNBC after neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2996615000,"Background Rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) infections have been neglected and epidemiological data are unavailable in Japan. Thus, we evaluated the prevalence and incidence of rectal CT/NG in a cohort of HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM), which was established at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), in Tokyo, Japan, in January 2017. Methods HIV-negative MSM aged ≥16 years old were included. The prevalence of rectal CT/NG among HIV-negative MSM was compared with that among an existing HIV-positive MSM cohort at NCGM. The HIV-negative MSM cohort was examined for rectal and pharyngeal CT/NG every 3 months. Urethral CT/NG was evaluated at the physician’s discretion. The incidences of CT/NG were evaluated in December 2018. Results Of 502 MSM initially included in this study, 13 men were diagnosed with HIV infection at enrollment and were subsequently excluded from the analysis. We evaluated 561 HIV-positive MSM for rectal CT/NG. The mean ages of the two cohorts were 33.6 and 46.2 years old, respectively (p<0.001). The prevalences of rectal CT were 16.4% and 15.9% (p = 0.707) and the prevalences of rectal NG were 4.1% and 2.3% (p = 0.101), for the HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM cohorts, respectively. Of 489 HIV-negative MSM, 328 were followed at least twice, with 261.1 person-years during the study period. The incidences of rectal CT/NG were 17.2 and 3.8/100 person-years and the incidences of pharyngeal CT/NG were 2.0 and 11.0/100 person-years for the two cohorts, respectively. Approximately 37.9% of incident cases were attributed to recurrent infection. Conclusions The prevalence and incidence of rectal CT/NG were high among MSM in Tokyo, Japan, suggesting that urgent countermeasures for early diagnosis and treatment are necessary."
https://openalex.org/W2995675501,"The templates for transcription and replication by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) polymerase are helical nucleocapsids (NCs), formed by viral RNAs that are encapsidated by the nucleoprotein (N). Proper NC assembly is vital for RSV polymerase to engage the RNA template for RNA synthesis. Previous studies of NCs or nucleocapsid-like particles (NCLPs) from RSV and other nonsegmented negative-sense RNA viruses have provided insights into the overall NC architecture. However, in these studies, the RNAs were either random cellular RNAs or average viral genomic RNAs. An in-depth mechanistic understanding of NCs has been hampered by lack of an in vitro assay that can track NC or NCLP assembly. Here we established a protocol to obtain RNA-free N protein (N 0 ) and successfully demonstrated the utility of a new assay for tracking assembly of N with RNA oligonucleotides into NCLPs. We discovered that the efficiency of the NCLP (N–RNA) assembly depends on the length and sequence of the RNA incorporated into NCLPs. This work provides a framework to generate purified N 0 and incorporate it with RNA into NCLPs in a controllable manner. We anticipate that our assay for in vitro trackable assembly of RSV-specific nucleocapsids may enable in-depth mechanistic analyses of this process."
https://openalex.org/W2995917057,"Genetic and functional studies have confirmed an important role for the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9 in human pain disorders. However, low functional expression of Nav1.9 in heterologous systems ( e.g. in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells) has hampered studies of its biophysical and pharmacological properties and the development of high-throughput assays for drug development targeting this channel. The mechanistic basis for the low level of Nav1.9 currents in heterologous expression systems is not understood. Here, we implemented a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the mechanisms that govern functional Nav1.9 expression. Recombinant expression of a series of Nav1.9-Nav1.7 C-terminal chimeras in HEK293 cells identified a 49-amino-acid-long motif in the C terminus of the two channels that regulates expression levels of these chimeras. We confirmed the critical role of this motif in the context of a full-length channel chimera, Nav1.9-Ct49aa Nav1.7 , which displayed significantly increased current density in HEK293 cells while largely retaining the characteristic Nav1.9-gating properties. High-resolution live microscopy indicated that the newly identified C-terminal motif dramatically increases the number of channels on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. Molecular modeling results suggested that this motif is exposed on the cytoplasmic face of the folded C terminus, where it might interact with other channel partners. These findings reveal that a 49-residue-long motif in Nav1.9 regulates channel trafficking to the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2996421422,"Introduction Recruiting participants to trials is challenging. To date, research has focussed on improving recruitment once the trial is underway, rather than planning strategies to support it, e.g. developing trial information leaflets together with people like those to be recruited. We explored whether people involved with participant recruitment have explicit planning strategies; if so, how these are developed, and if not, what prevents effective planning. Methods Design: Individual qualitative semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using a Framework approach, and themes linked through comparison of data within and across stakeholder groups. Participants: 23 international trialists (UK, Canada, South Africa, Italy, the Netherlands); 11 self-identifying as ‘Designers’; those who design recruitment methods, and 12 self-identifying as ‘Recruiters’; those who recruit participants. Interviewees’ had recruitment experience spanning diverse interventions and clinical areas. Setting: Primary, secondary and tertiary-care sites involved in trials, academic institutions, and contract research organisations supporting pharmaceutical companies. Results To varying degrees, respondents had prospective strategies for recruitment. These were seldom based on rigorous evidence. When describing their recruitment planning experiences, interviewees identified a range of influences that they believe impacted success: The timing of recruitment strategy development relative to the trial start date, and who is responsible for recruitment planning. The methods used to develop trialists’ recruitment strategy design and implementation skills, and when these skills are gained (i.e. before the trial or throughout). The perceived barriers and facilitators to successful recruitment planning; and how trialists modify practice when recruitment is poor. Conclusions Respondents from all countries considered limited time and disproportionate approvals processes as major challenges to recruitment planning. Poor planning is a mistake that trialists live with throughout the trial. The experiences of our participants suggest that effective recruitment requires strategies to increase the time for trial planning, as well as access to easily implementable evidence-based strategies."

However, it is unclear if CRF and MetS components respond similarly in men and women after HIIT. For 16 weeks, 63 women (53±7 years) and 56 men (55±8 years) with MetS underwent a three day/week HIIT program. Bodyweight and composition, VO2MAX, surrogate parameters of CRF (Ventilatory threshold (VT), oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES) and VE/VCO2 slope), maximal rate of fat oxidation (MFO), and MetS components were assessed before and after training. All reported variables were analyzed by split-plot ANOVA looking for time by sex interactions. Before training men had higher absolute values of VO2MAX (58.6%), and MFO (24.6%), while lower body fat mass (10.5%) than women (all P<0.05). After normalization by fat-free mass (FFM), VO2MAX remained 16.6% higher in men (P<0.05), whereas differences in MFO disappeared (P = 0.292). After intervention VO2MAX (P<0.001), VO2 at VT (P<0.001), OUES (P<0.001), and VE/VCO2 slope (P<0.001) increased without differences by sex (P>0.05). After training MetS Z-score (P<0.001) improved without differences between men and women (P>0.05). From the MetS components, only blood pressure (P<0.001) and waist circumference (P<0.001) improved across time, without differences by sex. In both, women and men, changes in OUES (r = 0.685 and r = 0.445, respectively), and VO2 at VT (r = 0.378, and r = 0.445, respectively), correlated with VO2MAX. While only bodyweight changes correlated with MetS Z-score changes (r = 0.372, and = 0.300, respectively). Despite baseline differences, 16-weeks of HIIT similarly improved MetS, cardiorespiratory and metabolic fitness in women and men with MetS. This suggests that there are no restrictions due to sex on the benefits derived from an intense exercise program in the health of MetS participants.

https://openalex.org/W2996233699,"Background To investigate the psychometric properties of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) questionnaire in a group of patients with different eye diseases. Methods Cross-sectional study. All subjects completed the Portuguese version of the NEI VFQ-25 questionnaire. Another questionnaire containing a survey about clinical and demographics data was also applied. Rasch analysis was used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the NEI VFQ-25. Results The study included 104 patients with cataract, 65 with glaucoma and 83 with age macular degeneration. Mean age was 70.7 ± 9.9 years, with 143 female (56.7%) and 109 male patients (43.2%). Mean visual acuity was 0.47 and 1.17 logMAR in the better and worse eye, respectively. According to Rasch analysis, seven items were found to misfit. Those items belonged to the following subscales: general health, social function, mental health, ocular pain and role limitations. The principal component analysis of the residuals showed that 55.5% of the variance was explained by the principal component. Eight items loaded positively onto the first contrast with a correlation higher than 0.4. These items belonged to the following subscales: near vision, distance vision, mental health and dependency. After excluding those items, we were able to isolate items from the NEI VFQ-25, related only to a visual functioning component. Finally, the principal component analysis from residuals of this revised version of the NEI VFQ-25 (items related to visual function) showed that the principal component explained 61.2% of the variance, showing no evidence of multidimensionality. Conclusions The Portuguese version of the NEI VFQ-25 is not a unidimensional instrument. We were able to find items that belong to a different trait, possible related to a socio-emotional component. Thus, in order to obtain psychometrically valid constructs, both the visual functioning and socio-emotional components should be analyzed separately."

Turkeys are fattened on mixed family-based farms scattered across the country, with most providing access to an uncovered outdoor pasture for the birds. Swiss fattening turkeys may therefore get infected with Chlamydiaceae via wild birds or their faeces, potentially shedding these bacteria at a later stage. The aim of the present study was to acquire baseline data about the shedding of Chlamydiaceae in clinically unremarkable Swiss fattening turkeys at slaughter, potentially exposing slaughterhouse workers to infection. In this large-scale study, 1008 cloacal swabs of Swiss turkeys out of 53 flocks from 28 different grow-out farms with uncovered outdoor pasture were collected over the course of 14 months and examined for the occurrence of Chlamydiaceae by a family-specific 23S-rRNA real-time PCR. Positive samples were further analyzed by Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci)-specific real-time PCR and the Arraymate DNA Microarray for species identification. All samples were negative for C. psittaci, but seven swabs out of one flock were tested positive for Chlamydia gallinacea (0.7%). Although turkeys with access to pasture may have contact with Chlamydiaceae-harbouring wild birds or their faeces, the infection rate in Swiss turkeys was shown to be low."

In the context of critical blood loss hypothermia might be fatal due to adverse side effects. Selective regional hypothermia might overcome these limitations. The aim of our study was to analyze the effects of regional gastric and oral mucosal hypothermia on μHbO2 and perfusion (μflow). In a cross-over study six anesthetized dogs were subjected to local oral and gastric mucosal hypothermia (34°C), or maintenance of local normothermia during normovolemia and hemorrhage (-20% blood volume). Macro- and microcirculatory variables were recorded continuously. During normovolemia, local hypothermia increased gastric microcirculatory flow (μflow) without affecting oxygenation (μHbO2) or oral microcirculation. During mild hemorrhagic shock gastric μHbO2 decreased from 72±2% to 38±3% in the normothermic group. This was attenuated by local hypothermia, where μHbO2 was reduced from 74±3% to 52±4%. Local perfusion, oral microcirculation and macrocirculatory variables were not affected. Selective local hypothermia improves gastric μHbO2 during hemorrhagic shock without relevant side effects. In contrast to systemic hypothermia, regional mucosal hypothermia did not affect perfusion and oxygen supply during hemorrhage. Thus, the increased μHbO2 during local hypothermia rather indicates reduced mucosal oxygen demand."
https://openalex.org/W2995162924,"Objective To compare the root and alveolar bone changes in first premolars adjacent to the orthodontic traction of buccal versus palatal maxillary impacted canines (MIC). Materials and methods Before and after traction, cone beam tomographic computed (CBCTs) of 25 subjects with unilateral/bilateral MIC were included in this follow-up and retrospective study. Thirty-six first premolars were divided into 2 groups, buccal (n = 15) or palatal (n = 21) MIC, and the tomographic images were evaluated before and after orthodontic traction. Root changes in length and area were measured in sagittal, coronal and axial sections. Dimensions of alveolar bone were evaluated in coronal sections. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons were performed using t or Mann-Whitney U tests. Multiple linear regressions analyses were used to evaluate the influence of all predictor variables on root and alveolar bone changes (P<0.05). Results Root and alveolar bone changes produced by orthodontic traction were not significant between groups. Root changes were smaller than 1 mm (length) and 2.51 mm2 (area). Alveolar bone changes between buccal and palatal MIC groups ranged from 0.13 mm to 1.69 mm Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed no significant influence of the impaction condition (buccal or palatal) on root change. Nevertheless, some different predictor variables of the MIC influence these changes. In the alveolar bone, the maximum upper alveolar width (MUAW) is the most affected by the traction of the MIC. Conclusions Orthodontic traction of buccal vs palatal MIC produces similar resorptive and appositional root and alveolar bone changes in the adjacent first premolars, without clinical relevance."

PΦB synthase is a ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductase (FDBR) that catalyzes the site-specific reduction of bilins, which are sensory and photosynthesis pigments, and produces PΦB from biliverdin, a heme-derived linear tetrapyrrole pigment. Here, we determined the crystal structure of tomato PΦB synthase in complex with biliverdin at 1.95 Å resolution. The overall structure of tomato PΦB synthase was similar to those of other FDBRs, except for the addition of a long C-terminal loop and short helices. The structure further revealed that the C-terminal loop is part of the biliverdin-binding pocket and that two basic residues in the C-terminal loop form salt bridges with the propionate groups of biliverdin. This suggested that the C-terminal loop is involved in the interaction with ferredoxin and biliverdin. The configuration of biliverdin bound to tomato PΦB synthase differed from that of biliverdin bound to other FDBRs, and its orientation in PΦB synthase was inverted relative to its orientation in the other FDBRs. Structural and enzymatic analyses disclosed that two aspartic acid residues, Asp-123 and Asp-263, form hydrogen bonds with water molecules and are essential for the site-specific A-ring reduction of biliverdin. On the basis of these observations and enzymatic assays with a V121A PΦB synthase variant, we propose the following mechanistic product release mechanism: PΦB synthase-catalyzed stereospecific reduction produces 2( R )-PΦB, which when bound to PΦB synthase collides with the side chain of Val-121, releasing 2( R )-PΦB from the synthase."
https://openalex.org/W2994768069,"Background Given that there are still considerable number of facilities which lack surgical specialists round the clock across the world, the ability to estimate the requirement for emergency surgery in victims of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) can ensure appropriate resource allocation. In this study, a surgical intervention in victims of MVC (SIM) score was developed and validated, using independent patient cohorts. Methods We retrospectively identified MVC victims in a nationwide trauma registry (2004–2016). Adults ≥ 15 years who presented with palpable pulse were included. Patients with missing data on the type/date of surgery were excluded. Patient were allocated to development or validation cohorts based on the date of injury. After missing values were imputed, predictors of the need for emergency thoracotomy and/or laparotomy were identified with multivariate logistic regression, and scores were then assigned using odds ratios. The SIM score was validated with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and calibration plots of SIM score-derived probability and observed rates of emergency surgery. Results We assigned 13,328 and 12,348 patients to the development and validation cohorts, respectively. Age, motor vehicle collision and vital signs on hospital arrival were identified as independent predictors for emergency thoracotomy and/or laparotomy, and SIM score was developed as 0–9 scales. The score has a good discriminatory power (AUROC = 0.79; 95% confidence interval = 0.77–0.81), and both estimated and observed rates of emergency surgery increased stepwise from 1% at a score ≤ 1 to almost 40% at a score ≥ 8 with linear calibration plots. Conclusions The SIM score was developed and validated to accurately estimate the need for emergent thoracotomy and/or laparotomy in MVC victims."
https://openalex.org/W2995059118,"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a clinically available hematopoietic cytokine. EPO has shown beneficial effects in the context of spinal cord injury and other neurological conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EPO on a rat model of spinal cord compression-induced cervical myelopathy and to explore the possibility of its use as a pharmacological treatment.To develop the compression-induced cervical myelopathy model, an expandable polymer was implanted under the C5-C6 laminae of rats. EPO administration was started 8 weeks after implantation of a polymer. Motor function of rotarod performance and grip strength was measured after surgery, and motor neurons were evaluated with H-E, NeuN and choline acetyltransferase staining. Apoptotic cell death was assessed with TUNEL and Caspase-3 staining. The 5HT, GAP-43 and synaptophysin were evaluated to investigate the protection and plasticity of axons. Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) was assessed to evaluate axonal injury. To assess transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue, the EPO levels in spinal cord tissue were measured with an ELISA for each group after subcutaneous injection of EPO.High-dose EPO maintained motor function in the compression groups. EPO significantly prevented the loss of motor neurons and significantly decreased neuronal apoptotic cells. Expression of 5HT and synaptophysin was significantly preserved in the EPO group. APP expression was partly reduced in the EPO group. The EPO levels in spinal cord tissue were significantly higher in the high-dose EPO group than other groups.EPO improved motor function in rats with compression-induced cervical myelopathy. EPO suppressed neuronal cell apoptosis, protected motor neurons, and induced axonal protection and plasticity. The neuroprotective effects were produced following transfer of EPO into the spinal cord tissue. These findings suggest that EPO has high potential as a treatment for degenerative cervical myelopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3037619594,"DNA barcoding is highly effective for identifying specimens once a reference sequence library is available for the species assemblage targeted for analysis. Despite the great need for an improved capacity to identify the insect pests of crops, the use of DNA barcoding is constrained by the lack of a well-parameterized reference library. The current study begins to address this limitation by developing a DNA barcode reference library for the pest aphids of Pakistan. It also examines the affinities of these species with conspecific populations from other geographic regions based on both conventional taxonomy and Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). A total of 809 aphids were collected from a range of plant species at sites across Pakistan. Morphological study and DNA barcoding allowed 774 specimens to be identified to one of 42 species while the others were placed to a genus or subfamily. Sequences obtained from these specimens were assigned to 52 BINs whose monophyly were supported by neighbor-joining (NJ) clustering and Bayesian inference. The 42 species were assigned to 41 BINs with 38 showing BIN concordance. These species were represented on BOLD by 7,870 records from 69 countries. Combining these records with those from Pakistan produced 60 BINs with 12 species showing a BIN split and three a BIN merger. Geo-distance correlations showed that intraspecific divergence values for 49% of the species were not affected by the distance between populations. Forty four of the 52 BINs from Pakistan had counterparts in 73 countries across six continents, documenting the broad distributions of pest aphids."
https://openalex.org/W2995203647,"The reduction of 2-para (iodophenyl)-3(nitrophenyl)-5(phenyl) tetrazolium chloride (INT) is increasingly being used as an indirect method to measure plankton respiration. Its greater sensitivity and shorter incubation time compared to the standard method of measuring the decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration, allows the determination of total and size-fractionated plankton respiration with higher precision and temporal resolution. However, there are still concerns as to the method’s applicability due to the toxicity of INT and the potential differential effect of plankton cell wall composition on the diffusion of INT into the cell, and therefore on the rate of INT reduction. Working with cultures of 5 marine plankton (Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1080/5, Emiliania huxleyi RCC1217, Pleurochrysis carterae PLY-406, Scrippsiella sp. RCC1720 and Oxyrrhis marina CCMP1133/5) which have different cell wall compositions (silica frustule, presence/absence of calcite and cellulose plates), we demonstrate that INT does not have a toxic effect on oxygen consumption at short incubation times. There was no difference in the oxygen consumption of a culture to which INT had been added and that of a replicate culture without INT, for periods of time ranging from 1 to 7 hours. For four of the cultures (T. pseudonana CCMP1080/5, P. carterae PLY-406, E. huxleyi RCC1217, and O. marina CCMP1133/5) the log of the rates of dissolved oxygen consumption were linearly related to the log of the rates of INT reduction, and there was no significant difference between the regression lines for each culture (ANCOVA test, F = 1.696, df = 3, p = 0.18). Thus, INT reduction is not affected by the structure of the plankton cell wall and a single INT reduction to oxygen consumption conversion equation is appropriate for this range of eukaryotic plankton. These results further support the use of the INT technique as a valid proxy for marine plankton respiration."
https://openalex.org/W2995548532,"Complete plant inventories of large areas of forests in the moderate and boreal zone have thus far been infeasible and have also not been published. The use of orienteering maps (O-maps) for sampling for inventories was tested. In the sampling method presented herein, the “O-map/way method”, O-maps were used for controlled and systematic inspection and sampling, making it possible to carry out successfully complete plant taxon and site inventories of large forest areas (1 to 100 ha). O-maps are much more suitable than the best national or similar topographic maps (NT-maps) for plant inventories in forests; O-maps have many advantages (smaller scale/better resolution, better legibility, internationally standardization, information on vegetation and accessibility), and they contain more small objects, ways (= tracks of any size; roads), and lines and thus have much smaller subareas that allow good orientation and systematic screening for plants. For the example of plant taxon inventories in 6 target areas of 25–85 ha of Swiss midland forests in the moderate/colline zone, the O-map/way method (all accessible areas are screened) was shown to be clearly superior to alternative sampling methods (partial areas screened), such as the NT-map/way method or a plot method, in which only 79.6±6.7% or 34.5±6.6%, respectively, of the taxa found by the O-map/way method were recorded. Taxa detected only by the O-map/way method were shown to be relatively rare at a local as well as at a national scale. The O-map/way method could also be successfully applied to the inventory of plant sites in large forest areas: As shown by the distribution of the sites of five plant species in a target area of 30.1 ha, the great majority of plant sites were detected only by the O-map/way method; but only a few sites were detected by the alternative methods. As O-maps for forests are widely available in many countries, the O-map/way method might allow for complete inventories and other studies in large forest areas."
https://openalex.org/W2996015418,"Kinesiology taping (KT) is used to manage musculoskeletal-related pain. There is a paucity of physiological studies evaluating the effect of KT on stimulus-evoked experimental pain.To investigate the effect of KT (applied to lumbar region) on cutaneous somatosensation to noxious and innocuous stimuli in humans with a non-sensitised normally functioning nociceptive system using quantitative sensory testing (QST).Fifty-four participants were randomised to one of three interventions: (i) KT (ii) standard 'rigid' taping (ST) (iii) sham taping (ShT). QST measurements were taken at lumbar sites pre-intervention (T1), during-intervention (T2) and during-intervention (T3) in the following sequence: warm-detection-threshold (WDT), heat-pain-threshold (HTPh), heat-pain-tolerance (HPTo), mechanical-detection-threshold (MDT), mechanical-pain-threshold (MPT) and pressure-pain-threshold (PPT).Mixed ANOVA revealed statistically significant interaction between Intervention and Time on MDT (p < .0005) and MPT (p < .0005) but not on WDT (p = .09), HPTh (p = .09), HPTo (p = .51) and PPT (p = .52) datasets. There was no significant simple main effect of Intervention on MDT at T2 (p = .68) and T3 (p = .24), and MPT at T2 (p = .79) and T3 (p = .54); post-hoc tests found KT and ST groups had higher (but non-significant) MDT and MPT than the ShT group. There was a significant simple main effect of Time on MDT and MPT for KT (p < .0005) and ST (p < .0005) groups; post-hoc tests found significant increases in MDT and MPT at T3 and T2 compared with T1 in both KT and ST groups. There was no significant simple main effect of Time on MDT (p = .13) nor MPT (p = .08) for the ShT group.Taping, irrespective of the elasticity, may modulate cutaneous mechanosensation. KT, ST and ShT seemed to have similar influence on cutaneous thermal and deep pressure nociception."
https://openalex.org/W2996108931,"Brucellosis in sheep and goats, a zoonotic disease primarily associated with Brucella melitensis infections, causes significant economic losses and public health concerns worldwide. Although control measures are effective, economic limitations and nomadic lifestyles may limit vaccination coverage, and test and removal policies may not be feasible. In this study, we evaluated the effects of therapy with a long acting antimicrobial tulathromycin on the pathogenesis of brucellosis. Thirty-five goats were randomly assigned for experimental infection with B. melitensis strain 16M while open or during mid-gestation. Approximately half of the animals in each group were then treated with tulathromycin and subsequently assessed for the development of humoral responses to infection, clinical presentation, and bacterial dissemination and colonization. All animals, regardless of treatment group were successfully challenged with B. melitensis 16M demonstrated by bacterial recovery from conjunctival swabs and development of positive antibody titers. In goats infected while open, no animals aborted and Brucella was recovered from only one animal in tulathromycin-treated and one animal from the untreated group. Tulathromycin treatment of pregnant goats did not prevent abortion nor did it reduce bacterial dissemination, colonization, or shedding. Our data suggests that treatment of goats in mid-gestation with tulathromycin at the labeled dose does not influence disease pathogenesis or tissue colonization after experimental B. melitensis challenge."
https://openalex.org/W2996139832,"Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal phosphorylation and accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, in both neuronal and glial cells. Though tau pathology in glial cells is a prominent feature of many of these disorders, the pathological contribution of these lesions to tauopathy pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Moreover, while tau pathology is predominantly found in the central nervous system, a role for tau in the cells of the peripheral nervous system has been described, though not well characterized. To investigate the effects of glial tau expression on the development and maintenance of the peripheral nervous system, we utilized a Drosophila melanogaster model of tauopathy that expresses human wild-type tau in glial cells during development. We found that glial tau expression during development results in larval locomotor deficits and organismal lethality at the pupal stage, without affecting larval neuromuscular junction synapse development or post-synaptic amplitude. There was, however, a significant decrease in the decay time of synaptic potentials upon repeated stimulation of the motoneuron. Behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by glial cell death, disrupted maintenance of glial-axonal integrity, and the abnormal accumulation of the presynaptic protein, Bruchpilot, in peripheral nerve axons. Together, these data demonstrate that human tau expression in Drosophila glial cells does not affect neuromuscular junction synapse formation during development, but is deleterious to the maintenance of glial-axonal interactions in the peripheral nervous system."
