https://openalex.org/W2805711807,"Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase parkin (PARK2, also known as PRKN) and the protein kinase PINK1 (also known as PARK6) are linked to autosomal-recessive juvenile parkinsonism (AR-JP)1,2; at the cellular level, these mutations cause defects in mitophagy, the process that organizes the destruction of damaged mitochondria3,4. Parkin is autoinhibited, and requires activation by PINK1, which phosphorylates Ser65 in ubiquitin and in the parkin ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain. Parkin binds phospho-ubiquitin, which enables efficient parkin phosphorylation; however, the enzyme remains autoinhibited with an inaccessible active site5,6. It is unclear how phosphorylation of parkin activates the molecule. Here we follow the activation of full-length human parkin by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and reveal large-scale domain rearrangement in the activation process, during which the phospho-Ubl rebinds to the parkin core and releases the catalytic RING2 domain. A 1.8 Å crystal structure of phosphorylated human parkin reveals the binding site of the phospho-Ubl on the unique parkin domain (UPD), involving a phosphate-binding pocket lined by AR-JP mutations. Notably, a conserved linker region between Ubl and the UPD acts as an activating element (ACT) that contributes to RING2 release by mimicking RING2 interactions on the UPD, explaining further AR-JP mutations. Our data show how autoinhibition in parkin is resolved, and suggest a mechanism for how parkin ubiquitinates its substrates via an untethered RING2 domain. These findings open new avenues for the design of parkin activators for clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2846099848,"The spliceosome catalyses the excision of introns from pre-mRNA in two steps, branching and exon ligation, and is assembled from five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs; U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) and numerous non-snRNP factors1. For branching, the intron 5' splice site and the branch point sequence are selected and brought by the U1 and U2 snRNPs into the prespliceosome1, which is a focal point for regulation by alternative splicing factors2. The U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP subsequently joins the prespliceosome to form the complete pre-catalytic spliceosome. Recent studies have revealed the structural basis of the branching and exon-ligation reactions3, however, the structural basis of the early events in spliceosome assembly remains poorly understood4. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae prespliceosome at near-atomic resolution. The structure reveals an induced stabilization of the 5' splice site in the U1 snRNP, and provides structural insights into the functions of the human alternative splicing factors LUC7-like (yeast Luc7) and TIA-1 (yeast Nam8), both of which have been linked to human disease5,6. In the prespliceosome, the U1 snRNP associates with the U2 snRNP through a stable contact with the U2 3' domain and a transient yeast-specific contact with the U2 SF3b-containing 5' region, leaving its tri-snRNP-binding interface fully exposed. The results suggest mechanisms for 5' splice site transfer to the U6 ACAGAGA region within the assembled spliceosome and for its subsequent conversion to the activation-competent B-complex spliceosome7,8. Taken together, the data provide a working model to investigate the early steps of spliceosome assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2866815595,"Climate models predict a possible increase in the frequency of strong climate events such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which in parts of the tropics are the cause of exceptional droughts, these threaten global food production. Agroforestry systems are often suggested as promising diversification options to increase farmers' resilience to extreme climatic events. In the Northeastern state of Bahia, where most Brazilian cocoa is grown in wildlife-friendly agroforests, ENSOs cause severe droughts which negatively affect forest and agriculture. Cocoa (Theobroma cacao) is described as being sensitive to drought but there are no field-studies of the effect of ENSO-related drought on adult cocoa trees in the America's; there is one study of an experimentally-imposed drought in Indonesia which resulted in 10 to 46% yield loss. In our study, in randomly chosen farms in Bahia, Brazil, we measured the effect of the 2015–16 severe ENSO, which caused an unprecedented drought in cocoa agroforests. We show that drought caused high cocoa tree mortality (15%) and severely decreased cocoa yield (89%); the drought also increased infection rate of the chronic fungal disease witches' broom (Moniliophthora perniciosa). Ours findings showed that Brazilian cocoa agroforests are at risk and that increasing frequency of strong droughts are likely to cause decreased cocoa yields in the coming decades. Furthermore, because cocoa, like many crops, is grown somewhat beyond its climatic limits, it and other crops could be the 'canaries in the coalmine' warning of forthcoming major drought effects on semi-natural and natural vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W2848139917,"We propose the χ-index as a bibliometric indicator that generalises the h-index. While the h-index is determined by the maximum square that fits under the citation curve of an author when plotting the number of citations in decreasing order, the χ-index is determined by the maximum area rectangle that fits under the curve. The height of the maximum rectangle is the number of citations ck to the kth most-cited publication, where k is the width of the rectangle. The χ-index is then defined as [Formula: see text], for convenience of comparison with the h-index and other similar indices. We present a comprehensive empirical comparison between the χ-index and other bibliometric indices, focusing on a comparison with the h-index, by analysing two datasets-a large set of Google Scholar profiles and a small set of Nobel prize winners. Our results show that, although the χ and h indices are strongly correlated, they do exhibit significant differences. In particular, we show that, for these data sets, there are a substantial number of profiles for which χ is significantly larger than h. Furthermore, restricting these profiles to the cases when ck > k or ck < k corresponds to, respectively, classifying researchers as either tending to influential, i.e. having many more than h citations, or tending to prolific, i.e. having many more than h publications."

https://openalex.org/W2848053033,"BACKGROUND: Speech and language therapy provision for aphasia (a language disorder) post stroke has been studied over time through surveys completed by speech and language therapists. This paper revisits provision based on what was received by 278 patients in 21 UK speech and language therapy departments in 2014-2016. AIMS: To explore the speech and language therapy received by community dwelling people with post stroke aphasia in the UK. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A quantitative content analysis was conducted by two speech and language therapist researchers. Therapy goals recorded were coded into categories and subcategories. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the frequency with which goal categories were targeted, average therapy time received, length and frequency of therapy sessions, personnel involved and mode of delivery. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Forty-five percent of participants were in receipt of therapy in the three month window observed. Six goal categories were identified. Rehabilitation was the most frequent (60%) followed by enabling (17.2%), review (4.3%), assessment (3.6%), supportive (3.5%) and activity to support therapy (2.8%). The median amount of therapy received in three months was 6.3 hours at an average of one 60-minute session every two weeks. Seventy-seven percent of therapy sessions were delivered by qualified speech and language therapists and 23% by assistants. Ninety percent of sessions were one to one, face to face sessions whilst 9.5% were group sessions. DISCUSSION: In line with previous reports, speech and language therapy for community dwelling stroke survivors with aphasia is restricted. Rehabilitation is a large focus of therapy but the intensity and dose with which it is provided is substantially lower than that required for an effective outcome. Despite this, one to one face to face therapy is favoured. More efficient methods to support more therapeutic doses of therapy are not commonly used in routine clinical services."
https://openalex.org/W2827473365,"High-glycemic-index diets, as well as a sedentary lifestyle are considered as determinant factors for the development of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in humans. These diets have been shown to shorten the life span of C. elegans in a manner that is dependent on insulin signaling, but the participation of other signaling pathways have not been addressed. In this study, we have determined that worms fed with high-glucose diets show alterations in glucose content and uptake, triglyceride content, body size, number of eggs laid, egg-laying defects, and signs of oxidative stress and accelerated aging. Additionally, we analyzed the participation of different key regulators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress and longevity such as SKN-1/NRF2, HIF-1/HIF1α, SBP-1/SREBP, CRH-1/CREB, CEP-1/p53, and DAF-16/FOXO, in the reduction of lifespan in glucose-fed worms."
https://openalex.org/W2841367123,"The development of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) and its progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is highly linked to exposure to acidic bile salts due to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this study, we investigated the role of Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1/redox effector factor-1 (APE1/REF-1) in STAT3 activation in response to acidic bile salts. Our results indicate that APE1 is constitutively overexpressed in EAC, whereas its expression is transiently induced in response to acidic bile salts in non-neoplastic BE. Using overexpression or shRNA knockdown of APE1, we found that APE1 is required for phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activation of STAT3. By using an APE1 redox-specific mutant (C65A) and APE1 redox inhibitor (E3330), we demonstrate that APE1 activates STAT3 in a redox-dependent manner. By using pharmacologic inhibitors and genetic knockdown systems, we found that EGFR is a required link between APE1 and STAT3. EGFR phosphorylation (Y1068) was directly associated with APE1 levels and redox function. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays indicated that APE1 coexists and interacts with the EGFR–STAT3 protein complex. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrated a significant induction in mRNA expression levels of STAT3 target genes (IL-6, IL-17A, BCL-xL, Survivin, and c-MYC) in BE and EAC cells, following acidic bile salts treatment. ChIP assays indicated that acidic bile salts treatment enhances binding of STAT3 to the promoter of its target genes, Survivin and BCL-xL. Inhibition of APE1/REF-1 redox activity using E3330 abrogated STAT3 DNA binding and transcriptional activity. The induction of APE1–STAT3 axis in acidic bile salts conditions provided a survival advantage and promoted cellular proliferation. In summary, our study provides multiple pieces of evidence supporting a critical role for APE1 induction in activating the EGFR–STAT3 signaling axis in response to acidic bile salts, the main risk factor for Barrett’s carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2853211942,"Salmonella is a major food-borne pathogen able to persist in food processing environments because of its ability to form biofilms. A Salmonella enterica serotype Agona isolate from poultry (S24) was grown at 37°C in biofilms for up to 144 hours (H144) in attachment to polystyrene surfaces. Biofilm structures were examined at different stages in their development (H3, H24, H48, H72, H96 and H144) using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in conjunction with fluorescent dyes for live cells (SYTO 9), dead cells (propidium iodide), proteins (fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I), lipids (DiD'oil), α-polysaccharides (concanavalin A, tetramethylrhodamine conjugate), and β-polysaccharides (calcofluor white M2R). Strain S24 developed a robust biofilm at H72 (biovolume of 166,852.5 ± 13,681.8 μm3 in the observation field of 16,078.2 μm2). The largest biovolume of live cells was also detected at H72 (128,110.3 ± 4,969.1 μm3), decreasing thereafter, which was probably owing to the detachment of cells prior to a new phase of colonization. The percentage of dead cells with regard to total cells in the biofilms increased throughout the incubation, ranging from 2.3 ± 1.1% (H24) to 44.2 ± 11.0% (H144). Proteins showed the greatest biovolume among the extracellular components within the biofilms, with values ranging from 1,295.1 ± 1,294.9 μm3 (H3) to 19,186.2 ± 8,536.0 μm3 (H96). Maximum biovolume values of 15,171.9 ± 660.7 μm3 (H48), 7,055.3 ± 4,415.2 μm3 (H144), and 2,548.6 ± 1,597.5 μm3 (H72) were observed for β-polysaccharides, α-polysaccharides and lipids, respectively. A strong (P < 0.01) positive correlation was found between the total biovolume of biofilm and the biovolume of live cells, proteins and β-polysaccharides, which may serve as useful markers of biofilm formation. The present work provides new insights into the formation of S. Agona biofilms. Our findings may contribute to the designing of reliable strategies for preventing and removing these bacterial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2876778388,"Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins that play critical roles in the pathogenesis of tumour malignancies. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterised by the aberrant expression of mucins. However, the role of mucin (MUC) 20 in PDAC remains unclear. PDAC is usually surrounded by a dense fibrotic stroma consisting of an extracellular matrix and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs). The stroma creates a nutrient-deprived, hypoxic, and acidic microenvironment, and promotes the malignant behaviours of PDAC cells. In this study, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that high MUC20 expression correlated with poor progression-free survival and high local recurrence rate of PDAC patients (n = 61). The expression of MUC20 was induced by serum deprivation, hypoxia, and acidic pH in PDAC cells. MUC20 knockdown with siRNA decreased cell viability, as well as migration and invasion induced by PSCs in HPAC and HPAF-II cells. In intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and orthotopic injection models, MUC20 knockdown decreased tumour growth in immunodeficient mice. Phospho-RTK array and western blot analysis indicated that MUC20 knockdown decreased HGF-mediated phosphorylation of MET in PDAC cells. Moreover, HGF-induced malignant phenotypes could be suppressed by MUC20 knockdown. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed the physical association of MUC20 and MET. These findings suggest that MUC20 knockdown suppresses the malignant phenotypes of PDAC cells at least partially through the inhibition of the HGF/MET pathway and that MUC20 could act as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2826400019,"Adiponectin is a fat tissue–derived adipokine with beneficial effects against diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Accordingly, adiponectin-mimetic molecules possess significant pharmacological potential. Oligomeric states of adiponectin appear to determine its biological activity. We identified a highly conserved, 13-residue segment (ADP-1) from adiponectin's collagen domain, which comprises GXXG motifs and has one asparagine and two histidine residues that assist in oligomeric protein assembly. We therefore hypothesized that ADP-1 promotes oligomeric assembly and thereby mediates potential metabolic effects. We observed here that ADP-1 is stable in human serum and oligomerizes in aqueous environments. We also found that ADP-1 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in an adaptor protein, phosphotyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1 (APPL1)-dependent pathway and stimulates glucose uptake in rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes). ADP-1–induced glucose transport coincided with ADP-1–induced biosynthesis of glucose transporter 4 and its translocation to the plasma membrane. ADP-1 induced an interaction between APPL1 and the small GTPase Rab5, resulting in AMPK phosphorylation, in turn leading to phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor α. Similar to adiponectin, ADP-1 increased the expression of the adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) gene. Of note, ADP-1 decreased blood glucose levels and enhanced insulin production in pancreatic β cells in db/db mice. Further, ADP-1 beneficially affected lipid metabolism by enhancing lipid globule formation in mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first report on identification of a short peptide from adiponectin with positive effects on glucose or fatty acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2835332910,"Food flows underpin the complex food supply chains that are prevalent in our increasingly globalized world. Recently, much effort has been devoted to evaluating the resources (e.g. water, carbon, nutrients) embodied in food trade. Now, research is needed to understand the scientific principles of the food commodity flows that underpin these virtual resource transfers. How do food flows vary with spatial scale? To address this question, we present an empirical analysis of food commodity flow networks across the full spectrum of spatial scales: global, national, and village. We discover properties of both scale invariance and scale dependence in food flow networks. The statistical distribution of node connectivity and mass flux are consistent across scales. Node connectivity follows a generalized exponential distribution, while node mass flux follows a Gamma distribution across scales. Similarly, the relationship between node connectivity and mass flux follows a power law across scales. However, the parameters of the distributions change with spatial scale. Mean node connectivity and mass flux increase with increasing scale. A core group of nodes exists at all scales, but node centrality increases as the spatial scale decreases, indicating that some households are more critical to village food exchanges than countries are to global trade. Remarkably, the structural network properties of food flows are consistent across spatial scales, indicating that a universal mechanism may underpin food exchange systems. In future research, this understanding can be used to develop theoretical models of food flow networks and to model food flows at resolutions for which empirical information is not available."
https://openalex.org/W2833055922,"Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells, with a vital role in innate immune defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Although mostly associated with pathological processes directly related to immune defense, they can also play a detrimental role in inflammatory conditions and have been found to have a pro-metastatic role in the spread of cancer cells. Here, we explore ways to temporarily suppress these detrimental activities. We first examined the possibility of using siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for transient knockdown of the human and mouse C5a receptor, an important chemoattractant receptor involved in neutrophil-mediated injury that is associated with myocardial infarction, sepsis, and neurodegenerative diseases. We found that siRNAs and ASOs transfected into cultured cell lines can eliminate 70–90% of C5a receptor mRNA and protein within 72 h of administration, a clinically relevant time frame after a cardiovascular event. Targeted drug delivery to specific cells or tissues of interest in a mammalian host, however, remains a major challenge. Here, using phage display technology, we have identified peptides that bind specifically to CD177, a neutrophil-specific surface molecule. We have attached these peptides to fluorescent, lipid-based nanoparticles and confirmed targeting and delivery to cultured cells ectopically presenting either human or mouse CD177. In addition, we have shown peptide-nanoparticle binding specifically to neutrophils in human and mouse blood. We anticipate that these or related tagged nanoparticles may be therapeutically useful for delivery of siRNAs or ASOs to neutrophils for transient knockdown of pro-inflammatory proteins such as the C5a receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2878990729,"Motion capture allows accurate recording of human motion, with applications in many fields, including entertainment, medicine, sports science and human computer interaction. A common difficulty with this technology is the occurrence of missing data, due to occlusions, or recording conditions. Various models have been proposed to estimate missing data. Some are based on interpolation, low-rank properties or inter-correlations. Others involve dataset matching or skeleton constraints. While the latter have the advantage of promoting a realistic motion estimation, they require prior knowledge of skeleton constraints, or the availability of a prerecorded dataset. In this article, we propose a probabilistic averaging method of several recovery models (referred to as Probabilistic Model Averaging (PMA) in this paper), based on the likelihoods of the distances between body points. This method has the advantage of being automatic, while allowing an efficient gap data recovery. To support and validate the proposed method, we use a set of four individual recovery models, based on linear/nonlinear regression in local coordinate systems. Finally, we propose two heuristic algorithms to enforce skeleton constraints in the reconstructed motion, which can be used on any individual recovery model. For validation purposes, random gaps were introduced into motion-capture sequences, and the effects of factors such as the number of simultaneous gaps, gap length and sequence duration were analyzed. Results show that the proposed probabilistic averaging method yields better recovery than (i) each of the four individual models and (ii) two recent state-of-the-art models, regardless of gap length, sequence duration and number of simultaneous gaps. Moreover, both of our heuristic skeleton-constraint algorithms significantly improve the recovery for 7 out of 8 tested motion-capture sequences (p < 0.05), for 10 simultaneous gaps of 5 seconds.

https://openalex.org/W2833377694,"Hyperactivation of Notch signaling and the cellular hypoxic response are frequently observed in cancers, with increasing reports of connections to tumor initiation and progression. The two signaling mechanisms are known to intersect, but while it is well established that hypoxia regulates Notch signaling, less is known about whether Notch can regulate the cellular hypoxic response. We now report that Notch signaling specifically controls expression of HIF2α, a key mediator of the cellular hypoxic response. Transcriptional upregulation of HIF2α by Notch under normoxic conditions leads to elevated HIF2α protein levels in primary breast cancer cells as well as in human breast cancer, medulloblastoma, and renal cell carcinoma cell lines. The elevated level of HIF2α protein was in certain tumor cell types accompanied by downregulation of HIF1α protein levels, indicating that high Notch signaling may drive a HIF1α-to-HIF2α switch. At the transcriptome level, the presence of HIF2α was required for approximately 21% of all Notch-induced genes: among the 1062 genes that were upregulated by Notch in medulloblastoma cells during normoxia, upregulation was abrogated in 227 genes when HIF2α expression was knocked down by HIF2α siRNA. In conclusion, our data show that Notch signaling affects the hypoxic response via regulation of HIF2α, which may be important for future cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2863443744,"Fear of infectious disease can create a variety of problems not the least of which is fear itself. An important question is how individuals attempt to manage their fear. The appearance of Zika in the U.S. presented an opportunity to examine this issue in a consequential natural context. Beginning nine days after the W.H.O. declared Zika a world health crisis, two-waves of survey data were collected from women ages 18-35 who were living in the Southern U.S. (N = 561). Most respondents (71%) used one or more emotion regulation strategies and a plurality (41%) utilized multiple strategies. Fear of Zika showed no demonstrable effect on avoidance, reappraisal, or contesting and none of these three strategies were effective at down-regulating fear. Fear and suppression, however, showed a self-reinforcing cycle in which fear increased use of suppression and suppression increased intensity of the fear response. Although the observed associations were small, even modest effects can be consequential when cumulated over time or across large numbers of individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2832545210,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common and serious chronic lung disease of premature infants. Severe BPD complicated with pulmonary hypertension (PH) increases the mortality of these infants. Riociguat is an allosteric soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator and is approved by the FDA for treating PH in adults. However, it has not been approved for use in neonates due to concern for adverse effects on long bone growth. To address this concern we investigated if administration of riociguat is beneficial in preventing hyperoxia-induced lung injury and PH without side effects on long bone growth in newborn rats. Newborn rats were randomized to normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (85% O2) exposure groups within 24 hours of birth, and received riociguat or placebo by once daily intraperitoneal injections during continuous normoxia or hyperoxia exposure for 9 days. In the hyperoxia control group, radial alveolar count, mean linear intercept and vascular density were significantly decreased, the pathological hallmarks of BPD, and these were accompanied by an increased inflammatory response. There was also significantly elevated vascular muscularization of peripheral pulmonary vessels, right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy indicating PH. However, administration of riociguat significantly decreased lung inflammation, improved alveolar and vascular development, and decreased PH during hyperoxia by inducing cGMP production. Additionally, riociguat did not affect long bone growth or structure. These data indicate that riociguat is beneficial in preventing hyperoxia-induced lung injury and PH without affecting long bone growth and structure and hence, suggests riociguat may be a potential novel agent for preventing BPD and PH in neonates."

https://openalex.org/W2859813806,"OI is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by bone fragility. More than 90% of patients are heterozygous for mutations in type I collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, and a common mutation is substitution for an obligatory glycine in the triple helical Gly-X-Y repeats. Few non-glycine substitutions in the triple helical domain have been reported; most result in Y-position substitutions of arginine by cysteine. Here, we investigated leucine and cysteine substitutions for one Y-position arginine, p.Arg958 (Arg780 in the triple helical domain) of proα1(I) chains that cause mild OI. We compared their effects with two substitutions for glycine located in close proximity. Like substitutions for glycine, those for arginine reduced the denaturation temperature of the whole molecule and caused asymmetric posttranslational overmodification of the chains. Circular dichroism and increased susceptibility to cleavage by MMP1, MMP2 and catalytic domain of MMP1 revealed significant destabilization of the triple helix near the collagenase cleavage site. On a cellular level, we observed slower triple helix folding and intracellular collagen retention, which disturbed the Endoplasmic Reticulum function and affected matrix deposition. Molecular dynamic modeling suggested that Arg780 substitutions disrupt the triple helix structure and folding by eliminating hydrogen bonds of arginine side chains, in addition to preventing HSP47 binding. The pathogenic effects of these non-glycine substitutions in bone are probably caused mostly by procollagen misfolding and its downstream effects."
https://openalex.org/W2866942771,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the major cause of end-stage liver disease (LD) worldwide. The aim of this study was to assess sustained virological response (SVR) rates in a real-world cohort of patients with HCV infection treated with interferon-free direct antiviral agents (DAA). Patients and methods All patients with genotypes 1, 2 or 3 HCV infection who started interferon-free treatment at a university hospital from December 2015 through July 2017 were included. The primary outcome was SVR at post-treatment week 12 by intention-to-treat (ITT) and modified ITT (mITT) analysis. Results Five hundred twenty seven patients were enrolled, 51.6% with cirrhosis. Most patients received sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + ribavirin (60.7%) and sofosbuvir + simeprevir (25.6%). Overall SVR rates were 90.5% for ITT and 96% for mITT. SVR rates were higher in non-cirrhotic (94.2% in ITT and 96.8% in mITT) versus cirrhotic patients (87.1% in ITT and 95.2% in mITT). In ITT and mITT assessments, SVR rates were higher in patients with Child-Pugh A (n = 222, 88.7% and 95.7%, respectively) versus Child-Pugh B or C (n = 40, 80% and 90%, respectively); SVR rates were higher in patients with genotype 1 (n = 405, 92.1% and 98.2%), followed by genotype 2 (n = 13, 84.6% and 92.7%) and genotype 3 (n = 109, 84.4% and 88.4%). Lower comorbidity index (p = 0.0014) and absence of cirrhosis (p = 0.0071) were associated with SVR. Among cirrhotic patients, lower Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (p = 0.0258), higher albumin (p = 0.0015), and higher glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.0366) were related to SVR. Twenty-two cirrhotic patients (8%) had clinical liver decompensation during treatment. Complications of advanced LD were responsible for discontinuation of treatment and death in 12 and 7 patients, respectively. Conclusion Treatment with all-oral DAA achieved high SVR rates, particularly in patients without cirrhosis and few comorbidities. Advanced LD is associated to poor outcome, such as treatment failure and death."

Higher eukaryotes have organelle-specific Hsp90 paralogs that are adapted to each subcellular environment. The mitochondrial Hsp90, TNF receptor–associated protein 1 (TRAP1), supports the folding and activity of electron transport components and is increasingly appreciated as a critical player in mitochondrial signaling. Calcium plays a well-known and important regulatory role in mitochondria where it can accumulate to much higher concentrations than in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, we found here that calcium can replace magnesium, the essential enzymatic cofactor, to support TRAP1 ATPase activity. Anomalous X-ray diffraction experiments revealed a calcium-binding site within the TRAP1 nucleotide-binding pocket located near the ATP α-phosphate and completely distinct from the magnesium-binding site adjacent to the β- and γ-phosphates. In the presence of magnesium, ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1, as with other Hsp90s, was noncooperative, whereas calcium binding resulted in cooperative hydrolysis by the two protomers within the Hsp90 dimer. The structural data suggested a mechanism for this cooperative behavior. Because of the cooperativity, at high ATP concentrations, ATPase activity was higher with calcium, whereas the converse was observed at low ATP concentrations. Integrating these observations, we propose a model in which the divalent cation choice can control switching between noncooperative and cooperative TRAP1 ATPase mechanisms in response to varying ATP concentrations.

Calcium-phosphate granules form inside the mitochondrial matrix facilitating calcium storage and buffering, and if completely dissolved, would reach molar concentrations (1Wolf S.G. Mutsafi Y. Dadosh T. Ilani T. Lansky Z. Horowitz B. Rubin S. Elbaum M. Fass D. 3D visualization of mitochondrial solid-phase calcium stores in whole cells.Elife. 2017; 6 (29106371): e29929Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Many studies show that calcium levels within mitochondria are tightly linked to both mitochondrial and cellular signaling pathways, including cell death via the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (2Crompton M. The mitochondrial permeability transition pore and its role in cell death.Biochem. J. 1999; 341 (10393078): 233-24910.1042/bj341023310.1042/0264-6021:3410233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Unsurprisingly, several mitochondrial enzymes are regulated by calcium ions (3Denton R.M. Regulation of mitochondrial dehydrogenases by calcium ions.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1787: 1309-131610.1016/j.bbabio.2009.01.005Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). In particular, mitochondrial dehydrogenases involved in ATP production are stimulated by calcium ions, suggesting a direct link to cellular energetics. Given the prevalence of calcium in the mitochondrial matrix, it is likely that calcium ions play important roles in regulating other mitochondrial proteins. In this study, we look at how a mitochondrial homolog of the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (TRAP1) 2The abbreviations used are: TRAP1TNF receptor–associated protein 1AMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphateNTDN-terminal domainCTDC-terminal dimerizing domainHspheat shock protein7-MESG7-methyl-6-thioguanosinePNPasepurine nucleoside phosphorylase. may be regulated by calcium binding via a novel mechanism. TNF receptor–associated protein 1 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate N-terminal domain C-terminal dimerizing domain heat shock protein 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Hsp90 molecular chaperones facilitate the folding and activation of ∼10% of cellular proteins (4Zhao R. Houry W.A. Hsp90: a chaperone for protein folding and gene regulation.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83 (16333321): 703-71010.1139/o05-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Increasingly, it is appreciated that Hsp90s can support function throughout a protein's lifetime, not just during initial synthesis or in response to cellular stress. Although Hsp90s are well conserved from bacteria to mammals, distinct orthologs can be found within organelles: Grp94 in the endoplasmic reticulum, TRAP1 in mitochondria, and Hsp90.5 in chloroplasts. Beyond their role in supporting individual “client” substrate proteins, cytosolic Hsp90s are critically important for maintaining protein homeostasis and modulating certain pro-apoptotic kinases. All Hsp90s are homodimers with each protomer composed of 3 globular domains: an ATP-binding N-terminal domain (NTD), a middle domain, and C-terminal dimerizing domain (CTD). Differences serve to adapt the Hsp90s for their various cellular roles, interactions with co-chaperones (cytoplasm only) and localizations. Hsp90s go through complex conformational rearrangements (domain rotations and open-closed transitions) throughout their ATP hydrolysis cycle (5Krukenberg K.A. Street T.O. Lavery L.A. Agard D.A. Conformational dynamics of the molecular chaperone Hsp90.Q. Rev.

Landscape of the mitochondrial Hsp90 metabolome in tumours.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4 (23842546): 2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TRAP1 structural studies have revealed the presence of a remarkably asymmetric closed state in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (19Lavery L.A. Partridge J.R. Ramelot T.A. Elnatan D. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Structural asymmetry in the closed state of mitochondrial Hsp90 (TRAP1) supports a two-step ATP hydrolysis mechanism.Mol.

Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Symmetry broken and rebroken during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1.Elife. 2017; 6 (28742020): e25235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As the primary client-binding site maps to the region of maximal asymmetry, this suggests a strong coupling between the asymmetry flip and client remodeling. Another unique feature of TRAP1 is an N-terminal extension that renders its open-closed equilibrium particularly sensitive to temperature variations, possibly connecting its folding and signaling role to mitochondrial thermogenesis (21Partridge J.R. Lavery L.A. Elnatan D. Naber N. Cooke R. Agard D.A. A novel N-terminal extension in mitochondrial TRAP1 serves as a thermal regulator of chaperone activity.eLife Sci. 2014; 3 (25531069): e03487Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although ATP is required to stabilize the closed N-terminally dimerized state in all Hsp90s, uniquely for TRAP1 closure (but not hydrolysis) will occur in the absence of any divalent cation co-factor (20Elnatan D. Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Symmetry broken and rebroken during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1.Elife. 2017; 6 (28742020): e25235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Partridge J.R. Lavery L.A.

A novel N-terminal extension in mitochondrial TRAP1 serves as a thermal regulator of chaperone activity.eLife Sci. 2014; 3 (25531069): e03487Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism and purpose of this phenomenon are unknown, there have been reports of free ATP (not complexed to Mg2+) existing in the mitochondrial matrix (22Gout E. Rébeillé F. Douce R. Bligny R. Interplay of Mg2+, ADP, and ATP in the cytosol and mitochondria: unravelling the role of Mg2+ in cell respiration.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014; 111 (25313036): E4560-E456710.1073/pnas.1406251111Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding how divalent cations may regulate TRAP1, experimental systems with purified protein can bypass the complexity of cell-based models; providing useful mechanistic insights that may be important in the cellular context. To this end, we investigated how the ATPase activity of TRAP1 is regulated by two divalent cations: magnesium or calcium. We found that unlike most other Hsp90 homologs, the TRAP1 ATPase can efficiently utilize calcium alone to support hydrolysis, and that the relative preference for magnesium or calcium depends upon the concentration of free ATP. Moreover, calcium induced a profound change in the cooperativity of ATP hydrolysis, indicating a change in the underlying mechanism. Crystallographic analysis revealed a calcium-binding site within the NTD distinct from that used by magnesium. These observations lead to a model of how cation binding within TRAP1 can influence the TRAP1 catalytic cycle in an ATP-level dependent manner. Given the role of mitochondria as a cellular calcium reservoir, we decided to test whether calcium might affect ATP hydrolysis by human TRAP1. ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 happens in the closed state when the NTDs are dimerized. This closed state can be stabilized by nonhydrolysable ATP analogs, or in the case of TRAP1, simply by omitting magnesium. Under these conditions, the rate of ATP turnover is much slower than the usually rate-limiting dimer closure, resulting in a build-up of the closed state (20Elnatan D. Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Symmetry broken and rebroken during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1.Elife. 2017; 6 (28742020): e25235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Partridge J.R. Lavery L.A. Elnatan D. Naber N. Cooke R. Agard D.A. A novel N-terminal extension in mitochondrial TRAP1 serves as a thermal regulator of chaperone activity.eLife Sci. 2014; 3 (25531069): e03487Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously taken advantage of this phenomenon to decouple dimer closure from ATP hydrolysis, which can be initiated by addition of Mg2+. The closed dimer reopens once ATP hydrolysis resumes, and this can be readily monitored by a FRET assay (Fig. 1A). Because the steady-state assay only reads out the slow step of dimer closure, we decided to test whether calcium alone can trigger ATP hydrolysis from the closed state. As previously observed, addition of magnesium causes loss of FRET signal due to hydrolysis-triggered dimer re-opening. The addition of calcium can also cause dimer opening (Fig. 1B), and with a ∼10-fold faster kinetics than magnesium. This suggests that in the absence of magnesium, calcium can fully support ATP hydrolysis by TRAP1 once it is closed. Next, we assessed whether calcium alone can support both closure and ATP hydrolysis. As previously observed (9Leskovar A. Wegele H. Werbeck N.D. Buchner J. Reinstein J. The ATPase cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 analog Trap1.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 (18287101): 11677-1168810.1074/jbc.M709516200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), ATPase activity in the presence of magnesium is noncooperative and reaches a plateau with as little as ∼50 μm ATP. By contrast, ATPase activity using calcium follows the Hill equation with n = 1.4 and an ATPase rate that is 1.6-fold faster than in magnesium at saturating ATP (Fig. 1C, see Table 1 for fitted parameters). While fitting the data, we noted that the Michaelis-Menten equation is a poor fit to the magnesium ATPase activity (Fig. S1). This behavior also appears to be conserved in zebrafish TRAP1 (zTRAP1) (Fig. S2). The “bump” on the curve between 0 and ∼200 μm ATP can be explained by a model in which the ATPase activity of the singly bound ATP state is greater than when ATPs are bound by both protomers. We confirmed this by measuring the ATPase activity of a heterodimeric mixture of hTRAP1 in which one ATP-binding site was inactivated via a D158N mutation. In the presence of magnesium, the ATPase activity curve of the heterodimer no longer has the bump and follows standard single-site Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 1d, blue line). The apparent affinity to ATP (K0.5 ATP, defined as the concentration at half-maximum of activity) measured in this heterodimer (Table 2) is close to that estimated by the WT experiment (Table 1) (58 versus 73 μm). As predicted, this half-occupied ATP heterodimeric mixture has a dramatically higher ATPase activity (3.8 min−1) than the fully occupied WT dimer (0.37 min−1) (Fig. 1D, Table 1, Table 2). This is consistent with previous heterodimer experiments where a related point mutant, which should also abolish ATP binding (D158A), appeared to stimulate ATPase activity (23Sung N. Lee J. Kim J-H. Chang C. Joachimiak A. Lee S. Tsai F.T. Mitochondrial Hsp90 is a ligand-activated molecular chaperone coupling ATP binding to dimer closure through a coiled-coil intermediate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The mechanism underlying this nontrivial rate enhancement is currently unknown, and it highlights yet another unique aspect of TRAP1 regulation by nucleotide. In contrast to the WT enzyme, the heterodimer ATPase activity in the presence of calcium is significantly reduced (0.6-fold), and consequently calcium is no longer preferred. To further examine whether the differential effects of magnesium versus calcium are a unique feature of TRAP1, ATPase activities of several Hsp90 orthologs were also measured. Beyond the general trend that ATPase activity is lower when calcium is used, none of the tested homologs exhibited the distinct ATP concentration-dependent activity as seen in TRAP1 (Fig. S3).Table 1Fitted parameters for enzyme kinetics data as a function of ATP concentration with excess divalent cations37 °C30 °ChTRAP1, MgCl2hTRAP1, CaCl2zTRAP1, MgCl2zTRAP1, CaCl2Vmax0.67 ± 0.010.82 ± 0.01Vsingle,ATP0.68 ± 0.051.50 ± 0.24Vdouble,ATP0.37 ± 0.020.56 ± 0.03K0.5,ATP56.1 ± 2.266.2 ± 2.5Ksingle,ATP (μm)58.0 ± 7.8126.3 ± 30.5Kdouble,ATP (μm)38.0 ± 19.925.2 ± 12.7nATP1.4 ± 0.01.8 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Table 2Fitted parameters for ATP titration kinetics in human TRAP1 WT:D158N heterodimer mixtureMgCl2CaCl2Vmax3.77 ± 0.062.31 ± 0.15K0.5 ATP (μm)72.5 ± 4.4273.2 ± 39.2 Open table in a new tab To better understand the inter-relationship between ATPase activity and divalent cation concentrations, we examined the effects of cation concentration under high and low ATP concentrations (hTRAP1 in Fig. 1, e and f; zTRAP1 in Fig. S4). The apparent affinity (K0.5 ion) and occupancy (nion) of the divalent cations can be approximated by fitting the Hill equation to initial rates from titrations at fixed ATP concentrations. At low ATP concentrations, hTRAP1 has a 2.8-fold tighter apparent affinity for magnesium than calcium (33 μm Mg2+ versus 92 μm Ca2+), whereas zTRAP1 has a 1.7-fold higher affinity (39 μm Mg2+ versus 66 μm Ca2+), and also ∼1.5-fold higher activity in both species (Table 3, low ATP). At low ATP concentrations, the ion-binding Hill coefficient is near 1.0 for both magnesium and calcium, suggesting that the cations preferentially bind to the protomer having one ATP bound. By contrast at high ATP concentrations, calcium binds ∼4.5-fold more tightly than magnesium in hTRAP1 (59 μm Mg2+ versus 13 μm Ca2+) and ∼7-fold in zTRAP1 (260 μm Mg2+ versus 37 μm Ca2+; see also Table 3, high ATP). The observed differences in apparent affinities between species most likely reflect intrinsic properties of each protein. At high ATP concentrations, n remains close to 1.0 for magnesium while indicating very significant cooperativity (n = 1.7) for calcium.Table 3Fitted parameters for divalent cation titrations in low versus high ATP concentrations for zebrafish and human TRAP1 Crystal structures of the closed state of TRAP1 clearly reveal a single magnesium-binding site on each protomer, coordinating the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP as is commonly observed in many ATPases. The unitary Hill coefficient for both ATP and magnesium likely reflects the obligatory sequential (noncooperative) nature of ATP hydrolysis previously observed (20Elnatan D. Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Symmetry broken and rebroken during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1.Elife. 2017; 6 (28742020): e25235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Identifying where calcium binds would greatly facilitate understanding how calcium imparts an apparent cooperativity in TRAP1 ATPase activity, which has never been observed in other Hsp90 homologs. As TRAP1 does not contain any apparent calcium-binding motifs, one possibility is that calcium binds at the same site used by magnesium, for example, as found in several other ATPases (Hsp70/DnaK/actin family) (24Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B. Morimoto R. Joachimiak A.

To determine where calcium binds in the closed state and any consequences on the structure, we replaced the magnesium in our standard zTRAP1 crystallization conditions (19Lavery L.A. Partridge J.R.

The structure was solved to a resolution of 2.6-Å using molecular replacement (Protein Data Bank code 6D14), and reveals a virtually identical asymmetric closed state (19Lavery L.A. Partridge J.R. Ramelot T.A. Elnatan D. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Structural asymmetry in the closed state of mitochondrial Hsp90 (TRAP1) supports a two-step ATP hydrolysis mechanism.Mol.

Despite the similarity in overall structure, no density coordinating the β- and γ-phosphates, where magnesium would be, was observed (Fig. S5, a and b). To unambiguously determine where calcium binds, we exploited the anomalous X-ray scattering signal from calcium and collected two datasets: one at 7450 eV (1.664 Å) and 11111 eV (1.116 Å). Although the anomalous difference at these energies is considerably weaker than what would be required for experimental phasing, significant peaks can be reliably observed for a well-determined structure using ANODE (26Thorn A. Sheldrick G.M. ANODE: anomalous and heavy-atom density calculation.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2011; 44 (22477786): 1285-128710.1107/S0021889811041768Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using phases from the solved structure without the contribution of calcium atoms, the resulting anomalous difference density map reveals one strong peak within the nucleotide pocket of each protomer, located just above the α-phosphate (Fig. 2A, inset). The density is tightly coordinated by six oxygen atoms in an octahedral arrangement near the “lid” of the NTD (4 backbone carbonyl oxygens, a tyrosine hydroxyl, and the α-phosphate) (Fig. 2b). As a control, anomalous data were collected from crystals lacking both calcium and magnesium prepared for another study (20Elnatan D. Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A. Symmetry broken and rebroken during the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial Hsp90 TRAP1.Elife. 2017; 6 (28742020): e25235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these crystals excess EDTA was used and the dimer was closed with ATP instead of AMPPNP. No significant anomalous peaks were detected near the α-phosphate (Fig. S5c), again providing strong support that the peak observed in Fig. 2a is indeed from a calcium atom. Enzymatic studies of Hsp90 have almost exclusively used magnesium as a co-factor. Following up on an unexpected observation that calcium alone was sufficient to support TRAP1 ATPase activity, here we show that TRAP1 has a higher ATPase activity in the presence of calcium than in magnesium. This contrasts sharply with other Hsp90 orthologs, which are significantly less active with calcium. Strikingly, there are also significant differences in ATPase behavior as a function of ATP and cation concentration, with calcium inducing a cooperative dependence on ATP. Furthermore, at high ATP levels, activity cooperatively depends on calcium concentration, whereas magnesium acts noncooperatively. Consequently, calcium can differentially regulate TRAP1 activity in an ATP-concentration dependent manner. Together this reveals that these ions must act by quite distinct underlying mechanisms. Rather than being a magnesium mimic positioned to stabilize negative charge build-up on the β- and γ-phosphates at the catalytic transition state, direct visualization of the calcium-binding site by crystallography shows that calcium occupies a site near the α-phosphate (Fig. 2B). In the closed state, the calcium is octahedrally coordinated by backbone carbonyl oxygens from the ATP lid, Tyr-221 hydroxyl, and the ATP α-phosphate oxygen. Unlike the magnesium site, this site is configured quite differently in the apo state versus the closed state, thus providing a unique coupling between open-closed conformation and calcium binding (Fig. 3, Movie S1). TRAP1's ability to close does not require divalent cations, because ATP alone is sufficient to stabilize the closed state and reach an identical asymmetric conformation (20Elnatan D. Betegon M. Liu Y. Ramelot T. Kennedy M.A. Agard D.A.

Moreover, because dimer closure is rate-limiting in the ATPase cycle, any decrease in catalytic efficiency caused by the absence of a magnesium-stabilized transition state is not expected to dramatically alter the overall reaction rate. Whether there is an alternative hydrolysis pathway where solvent can stabilize the charge build-up on the β- and γ-phosphates while the calcium activates a different attacking water is not clear.

https://openalex.org/W2866886394,"Keel fractures represent a major productivity and welfare issue for the laying hen industry with greater than 50% of birds in recent surveys across various commercial operations and nations exhibiting some form of damage by end of lay. While the causes are likely multifactorial and influenced by age, diet, genetic line, and other factors, high energy collisions with house furnishings and conspecifics in the barn are believed to be a major contribution to the frequency and severity of factures. The current study applies a previously described ex vivo impact testing protocol to quantify susceptibility to keel bone damage across an extensive range of collision energies and ages. We also link fracture susceptibility with bone and physiological measures likely to influence skeletal resilience. Further, we applied the impact testing protocol to evaluate the benefit of an omega-3 enriched diet to improve bone health and reduce fracture susceptibility. Our results indicated that fracture susceptibility increased rapidly from 23 weeks of age, peaking at 49.5 weeks of age and thereafter decreasing. Fracture susceptibility also varied with multiple natural characteristics of bone, including mineral density, though the nature of that relationship was dependent on whether an old fracture was present. Severity of the experimental fracture demonstrated considerable variation with collision energy and biomechanical properties. An omega-3 enhanced diet provided a protective effect against fractures, though only in terms of collision energies that were relatively low. In conclusion, the impact testing protocol provided a unique means to assess fracture susceptibility and quantify the role of likely influencing bird-level biological factors, both those that vary naturally as well as when altered through specific interventions."

Introducing legumes such as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) into the complementary diet has the potential to improve childhood growth by improving diet quality through improvements in macro- and micronutrients and also by reducing gut inflammation. However, cowpea is relatively underutilized in complementary feeding in Malawi due to its strong taste, long processing time, and high energy requirements for processing. Effective utilization of cowpea in complementary feeding requires processing which may affect chemical composition as well as sensory quality. The present study evaluated the effect of processing on the retention of zinc, crude fibre, and flavonoid in roasted, boiled, and dehulled cowpea flours, and assessed the acceptability of maize porridge (70%) enriched with one of the three cowpea flours (30%). Roasting, dehulling, and boiling did not have any effect on zinc content. Crude fibre content increased after processing by all methods. Processing had no effect on measurable flavonoids. Roasted, boiled, and dehulled cowpea blended maize porridges were acceptable to children with mean quantities of leftover food of less than 3g from the given 100g. Caregivers also rated the blended flours to be highly acceptable to them as well, with maize porridge blended with dehulled cowpea flour the most acceptable to both children and caregivers. These results demonstrate that cowpea flour, processed by any of these three different methods, could serve as a useful addition to maize porridge for complementary feeding of children in sub-Saharan Africa."

This pilot study evaluated a decision-aid booklet (DA) for patients with BPII (and their family) to obtain evidence on its acceptability, feasibility, safety, and usefulness in potential end-users.The DA booklet was developed according to International Patient Decision-Aid Standards. Thirty-one patients diagnosed with BPII and their families (n = 11), who were currently making or had previously made treatment decisions, participated. Participants read the DA and completed validated and purpose-designed questionnaires. A follow-up semi-structured telephone interview elicited more in-depth DA feedback (n = 40).Patients and family endorsed the DA booklet as: easy-to-use (100% agree), useful in treatment decision-making (100%), presenting balanced (patients = 96.8%, family = 100%), up-to-date (93.5%, 100%) and trustworthy information (93.5%, 100%) that did not provoke anxiety (93.5%, 90.9%). All participants stated that they would recommend the DA to others. Following DA use, all except one participant (97.6%) demonstrated adequate treatment knowledge (> 50% score). Patients reported low decisional conflict (M = 18.90/100) following DA use and felt well-prepared to make treatment decisions (M = 4.28/5). Most patients (90.3%) indicated uptake of treatments consistent with the best available clinical evidence. Additionally, a large proportion of patients made an informed choice about medication (65.5%) with adjunctive psychological treatment (50.0%), based on adequate knowledge and their treatment values. Interview findings further supported the DA's acceptability among participants.Pilot findings indicate that patients with BPII and their family consider this DA booklet highly acceptable and useful in making evidence-based treatment decisions that align with their treatment preferences."
https://openalex.org/W2827627817,"Given their role in female reproduction, the effects of progesterone on arginine and related amino acids, polyamines and NF-κB p65 activation were studied across the menstrual cycle.Arginine, ornithine and citrulline as well as putrescine, spermidine, spermine, and N-acetyl-putrescine were determined in plasma, NF-κB p65 activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and progesterone in serum of 28 women at early (T1) and late follicular (T2) and mid (T3) and late (T4) luteal phase.Arginine and related amino acids declined from T1 and T2 to T3 and T4, while progesterone increased. At T3, arginine, ornithine, and citrulline were inversely related with progesterone. Changes (ΔT3-T2) in arginine, ornithine, and citrulline were inversely related with changes (ΔT3-T2) in progesterone. Ornithine and citrulline were positively related with arginine, as were changes (ΔT3-T2) in ornithine and citrulline with changes (ΔT3-T2) in arginine. At T2, NF-κB p65 activation was positively related with arginine. Polyamines did not change and were not related to progesterone. All results described were significant at P < 0.001.This study for the first time provides data, at the plasma and PBMC level, supporting a proposed regulatory node of arginine and related amino acids, progesterone and NF-κB p65 at luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, aimed at successful preparation of pregnancy."

Physiological, biochemical characteristics and 16S ribosomal RNA sequence homology studies revealed that it was similar to Streptomyces levis (sequence similarity 100%). The microbial strain was submitted to Genomebio Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Pune, Maharashtra, India under Accession No. EU124569. The isolated strain was found to produce extracellular active compound showing strong antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741 and Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96. The antibacterial compound was successfully isolated and purified. Structure elucidation of antibacterial metabolite with EI-MS/ HRMS showed molecular ion peak at m/z 686 [M+H]+. Whereas, elemental analysis of the said compound showed C = 61.31, H = 8.61, N = 2.04 and O = 28.02, and indicated a molecular formula of C35H59NO12. The presence of 'chromone' nucleus in the compound's chemical structure was confirmed by using 1HNMR studies. The present study reports the purification of potential antibacterial compound from Streptomyces levis isolated from the unexplored soil of north India and warrants for further characterization of this potential compound for optimum utilization for antimicrobial purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2839653590,"The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) is equipped with good properties for screening the broader phenotype of autistic traits, but it is standardized for a limited age range—from 7 to 16 years. To contribute to the early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), particularly in high functioning children with ASD, likely to cause maladjustments during school age, the present study examined psychometric properties to apply the ASSQ to a younger age. We tested parents’ ASSQ ratings for preschool children in clinical (N = 154, average age 60.77 months, range 55–72 months) and community settings (N = 1390, average age 60.53 months, range 57–68 months) in Japan. The results showed, just as in school-aged children, the ASSQ had reliability and validity as a screening instrument for preschool children in community settings. A cut-off of 7 with sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.84 is recommended for community screening. Still, based on the current study with a clinical group, an optimal cut-off score with high sensitivity and high specificity for parents’ ASSQ ratings could not be established. The clinicians should be reminded that the ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnosing instrument. Also, this result suggest multi-faceted evaluation is necessary in clinical settings, for example, the addition of teachers’ ratings."
https://openalex.org/W2845891074,"The successful adaptation of cockroaches is, in part, dependent of the activity of their obligatory endosymbionts, Blattabacterium spp., which are involved in uric acid degradation, nitrogen assimilation and nutrient provisioning. Their strategic localization, within bacteriocytes in the proximities of uric acid storage cells (urocytes), highlights their importance in the recycling of nitrogen from urea and ammonia, end-products not secreted by their host insects. In this study, we present the complete genome sequence of two new Blattabacterium spp. from Periplaneta fuliginosa (BPfu) and P. japonica (BPja), and detailed comparison with other Blattabacterium strains from different cockroach species. The genomes of BPfu and BPja show a high degree of stability as showed with for other Blattabacterium representatives, only presenting a 19-kb fragment inversion between BPja and BPfu. In fact, the phylogenomics showed BPja as an ancestor species of BPfu, BPLAN (P. americana) and BBor (Blatta orientalis), in congruence with their host cockroach phylogeny. Their functional profile is similar and closest to the omnivorous strain BBge (Blattella germanica). Interesting, BPja possesses the complete set of enzymes involved sulfate assimilatory pathway only found in BBge and BMda (Mastotermes darwiniensis). The newly sequenced genomes of BPja and BPfu emphasise the remarkable stability of Blattabacterium genomes supported by their long-term coevolution and obligatory lifestyle in their host insect."
https://openalex.org/W2855921754,"Aurora kinases are critical mitotic serine/threonine kinases and are often implicated in tumorigenesis. Recent studies of the interphase functions for aurora kinase (Aurk)A have considerably expanded our understanding of its role beyond mitosis. To identify the unknown targets of AurkA, we used peptide array-based screening and found E2F4 to be a novel substrate. Phosphorylation of E2F4 by AurkA at Ser75 regulates its DNA binding and subcellular localization. Because E2F4 plays an important role in skeletal muscle differentiation, we attempted to gain insight into E2F4 phosphorylation in this context. We observed that a block in E2F4 phosphorylation retained it better within the nucleus and inhibited muscle differentiation. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a perturbation of the gene network involved in the process of muscle differentiation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively, our findings establish a novel role of AurkA in the process of skeletal muscle differentiation.-Dhanasekaran, K., Bose, A., Rao, V. J., Boopathi, R., Shankar, S. R., Rao, V.

https://openalex.org/W2951534263,"Probabilistic proposals of Language of Thoughts (LoTs) can explain learning across different domains as statistical inference over a compositionally structured hypothesis space. While frameworks may differ on how a LoT may be implemented computationally, they all share the property that they are built from a set of atomic symbols and rules by which these symbols can be combined. In this work we propose an extra validation step for the set of atomic productions defined by the experimenter. It starts by expanding the defined LoT grammar for the cognitive domain with a broader set of arbitrary productions and then uses Bayesian inference to prune the productions from the experimental data. The result allows the researcher to validate that the resulting grammar still matches the intuitive grammar chosen for the domain. We then test this method in the language of geometry, a specific LoT model for geometrical sequence learning. Finally, despite the fact of the geometrical LoT not being a universal (i.e. Turing-complete) language, we show an empirical relation between a sequence’s probability and its complexity consistent with the theoretical relationship for universal languages described by Levin’s Coding Theorem."
https://openalex.org/W2811752685,"During reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome, two strand-transfer events occur. Both events rely on the RNase H cleavage activity of reverse transcriptases (RTs) and template homology. Using a panel of mutants of HIV-1BH10 (group M/subtype B) and HIV-1ESP49 (group O) RTs and in vitro assays, we demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between RT minus-strand transfer efficiency and template-primer binding affinity. The highest strand transfer efficiencies were obtained with HIV-1ESP49 RT mutants containing the substitutions K358R/A359G/S360A, alone or in combination with V148I or T355A/Q357M. These HIV-1ESP49 RT mutants had been previously engineered to increase their DNA polymerase activity at high temperatures. Now, we found that RTs containing RNase H-inactivating mutations (D443N or E478Q) were devoid of strand transfer activity, whereas enzymes containing F61A or L92P had very low strand transfer activity. The strand transfer defect produced by L92P was attributed to a loss of template-primer binding affinity and, more specifically, to the higher dissociation rate constants (koff) shown by RTs bearing this substitution. Although L92P also deleteriously affected the RT's nontemplated nucleotide addition activity, neither nontemplated nucleotide addition activity nor the RT's clamp activities contributed to increased template switching when all tested mutant and WT RTs were considered. Interestingly, our results also revealed an association between efficient strand transfer and the generation of secondary cleavages in the donor RNA, consistent with the creation of invasion sites.

https://openalex.org/W2870544594,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding and regulatory RNAs produce by cell endogenously. They are 18-26 nucleotides in length and play important roles at the post-transcriptional stage of gene regulation. Evolutionarily, miRNAs are conserved and their conservation plays an important role in the prediction of new miRNAs in different plants. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important diet and consumed as second major crop in the world. This significant cereal crop was focused here through comparative genomics-based approach to identify new conserved miRNAs and their targeted genes. This resulted into a total of 212 new conserved precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) belonging to 185 miRNA families. These newly profiled wheat's miRNAs are also annotated for stem-loop secondary structures, length distribution, organ of expression, sense/antisense orientation and characterization from their expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Moreover, fifteen miRNAs along with housekeeping gene were randomly selected and subjected to RT-PCR expressional validation. A total of 32927 targets are also predicted and annotated for these newly profiled wheat miRNAs. These targets are found to involve in 50 gene ontology (GO) enrichment terms and significant processes. Some of the significant targets are RNA-dependent DNA replication (GO:0006278), RNA binding (GO:0003723), nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676), DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (GO:0003899), magnesium ion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015095), antiporter activity (GO:0015297), solute:hydrogen antiporter activity (GO:0015299), protein kinase activity (GO:0004672), ATP binding (GO:0005524), regulation of Rab GTPase activity (GO:0032313) Rab GTPase activator activity (GO:0005097), regulation of signal transduction (GO:0009966) and phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor activity (GO:0004864).

https://openalex.org/W2821653027,"This investigation compared the perceived effectiveness of supportive counselling (SC) and prolonged exposure for adolescents (PE-A) by treatment users (adolescents with PTSD) and non-specialist treatment providers (supervised nurses).Adolescent participants and nurse providers were purposively recruited to share their experiences of trial participation through face to face semi-structured in-depth interviews and treatment-specific focus groups (all recorded). Twelve adolescent participant transcripts (ten interviews and two focus groups) and three nurse provider transcripts were doubly transcribed. Thematic content analysis was applied using Atlas.ti software. Two emerging themes are presented in this paper: 1) Perceptions of the intervention and 2) Usefulness of the intervention.Regardless of treatment arm, adolescents experienced warm counselling relationships and described the process of extending trust to the counselor. Adolescents in the PE-A arm provided clear descriptions of session structure and treatment rationale compared with adolescents receiving SC. The most helpful tools were breathing retraining and imaginal exposure for PE-A and creation of distraction strategies during non-directive SC. Adolescents in both arms continued to use the techniques acquired during treatment and reported symptom improvement. Participants who received SC acknowledged ongoing reexperiencing. Nurses perceived SC to be an immediately transferable skill, but feedback on their preference for one intervention over the other was inconclusive.Both PTSD treatment strategies, implemented by non-specialists, were perceived as helpful. Overall, adolescents reported warm therapeutic relationships and a reduction in PTSD symptoms. Nurses stated that they would require institutional support to ensure delivery of these interventions in a scalable and sustainable manner."
https://openalex.org/W2821992856,"The oxyvinylglycine 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG) arrests the germination of weedy grasses and inhibits the growth of the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Both biological and analytical methods have previously been used to detect the presence of FVG in crude and extracted culture filtrates of several Pseudomonas fluorescens strains. Although a combination of these techniques is adequate to detect FVG, none is amenable to high-throughput analysis. Likewise, filtrates often contain complex metabolite mixtures that prevent the detection of FVG using established chromatographic techniques. Here, we report the development of a new method that directly detects FVG in crude filtrates using laser ablation electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LAESI-MS). This approach overcomes limitations with our existing methodology and allows for the rapid analysis of complex crude culture filtrates. To validate the utility of the LAESI-MS method, we examined crude filtrates from Pantoea ananatis BRT175 and found that this strain also produces FVG. These findings are consistent with the antimicrobial activity of P. ananatis BRT175 and indicate that the spectrum of bacteria that produce FVG stretches beyond rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens."

https://openalex.org/W2817230170,"Structural rearrangements of the genome can drive lung tumorigenesis through the generation of fusion genes with oncogenic properties. Advanced genomic approaches have identified the presence of a genetic fusion between fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and transforming acidic coiled-coil 3 (TACC3) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), providing a novel target for FGFR inhibition. To interrogate the functional consequences of the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion in the transformation of lung epithelial cells, we generated a novel transgenic mouse model that expresses FGFR3-TACC3 concomitant with loss of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Intranasal delivery of an Ad5-CMV-Cre virus promoted seromucinous glandular transformation of olfactory cells lining the nasal cavities of FGFR3-TACC3 (LSL-F3T3) mice, which was further accelerated upon loss of p53 (LSL-F3T3/p53). Surprisingly, lung tumors failed to develop in intranasally infected LSL-F3T3 and LSL-F3T3/p53 mice. In line with these observations, we demonstrated that intranasal delivery of Ad5-CMV-Cre induces widespread Cre-mediated recombination in the olfactory epithelium. Intra-tracheal delivery of Ad5-CMV-Cre into the lungs of LSL-F3T3 and LSL-F3T3/p53 mice, however, resulted in the development of lung adenocarcinomas. Taken together, these findings provide in vivo evidence for an oncogenic function of FGFR3-TACC3 in respiratory epithelium."
https://openalex.org/W2833412004,"Bacterial flagella are rotary nanomachines that contribute to bacterial fitness in many settings, including host colonization. The flagellar motor relies on the multiprotein flagellar motor-switch complex to govern flagellum formation and rotational direction. Different bacteria exhibit great diversity in their flagellar motors. One such variation is exemplified by the motor-switch apparatus of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which carries an extra switch protein, FliY, along with the more typical FliG, FliM, and FliN proteins. All switch proteins are needed for normal flagellation and motility in H. pylori, but the molecular mechanism of their assembly is unknown. To fill this gap, we examined the interactions among these proteins. We found that the C-terminal SpoA domain of FliY (FliYC) is critical to flagellation and forms heterodimeric complexes with the FliN and FliM SpoA domains, which are β-sheet domains of type III secretion system proteins. Surprisingly, unlike in other flagellar switch systems, neither FliY nor FliN self-associated. The crystal structure of the FliYC-FliNC complex revealed a saddle-shaped structure homologous to the FliN-FliN dimer of Thermotoga maritima, consistent with a FliY-FliN heterodimer forming the functional unit. Analysis of the FliYC-FliNC interface indicated that oppositely charged residues specific to each protein drive heterodimer formation. Moreover, both FliYC-FliMC and FliYC-FliNC associated with the flagellar regulatory protein FliH, explaining their important roles in flagellation. We conclude that H. pylori uses a FliY-FliN heterodimer instead of a homodimer and creates a switch complex with SpoA domains derived from three distinct proteins."

Cell fate decision depends on elaborate interactions between distinct signalling pathways, namely Notch, WNT, TGFβ, and Hedgehog. Several in vitro protocols have been established to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into either hepatocyte or cholangiocyte like cells (HLC/CLC) to enable disease modelling or drug screening. During HLC differentiation we observed the occurrence of epithelial cells with a phenotype divergent from the typical hepatic polygonal shape- we refer to these as endoderm derived epithelial cells (EDECs). These cells do not express the mature hepatocyte marker ALB or the progenitor marker AFP. However they express the cholangiocyte markers SOX9, OPN, CFTR as well as HNF4α, CK18 and CK19. Interestingly, they express both E Cadherin and Vimentin, two markers that are mutually exclusive, except for cancer cells. EDECs grow spontaneously under low density cell culture conditions and their occurrence was unaffected by interfering with the above mentioned signalling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2873176665,"Heterodimeric KIF3AC and KIF3AB, two members of the mammalian kinesin-2 family, generate force for microtubule plus end-directed cargo transport. However, the advantage of heterodimeric kinesins over homodimeric ones is not well-understood. We showed previously that microtubule association for entry into a processive run was similar in rate for KIF3AC and KIF3AB at ∼7.0 μm-1 s-1 Yet, for engineered homodimers of KIF3AA and KIF3BB, this constant is significantly faster at 11 μm-1 s-1 and much slower for KIF3CC at 2.1 μm-1 s-1 These results led us to hypothesize that heterodimerization of KIF3A with KIF3C and KIF3A with KIF3B altered the intrinsic catalytic properties of each motor domain. Here, we tested this hypothesis by using presteady-state stopped-flow kinetics and mathematical modeling. Surprisingly, the modeling revealed that the catalytic properties of KIF3A and KIF3B/C were altered upon microtubule binding, yet each motor domain retained its relative intrinsic kinetics for ADP release and subsequent ATP binding and the nucleotide-promoted transitions thereafter. These results are consistent with the interpretation that for KIF3AB, each motor head is catalytically similar and therefore each step is approximately equivalent. In contrast, for KIF3AC the results predict that the processive steps will alternate between a fast step for KIF3A followed by a slow step for KIF3C resulting in asymmetric stepping during a processive run. This study reveals the impact of heterodimerization of the motor polypeptides for microtubule association to start the processive run and the fundamental differences in the motile properties of KIF3C compared with KIF3A and KIF3B."
https://openalex.org/W2857933980,"Purpose This study was to evaluate whether optic nerve damage occurs in eyes with adjacent chronic sinusitis. Methods Data were collected from eighty-eight eyes of 46 chronic sinusitis patients and 93 eyes of 57 normal controls. Visual sensitivity using standard automated perimetry (SAP) and inner retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT) were measured. The Lund-Mackay system was used to quantify radiographic findings on the ostiomeatal unit CT scan with a numerical score representing the severity of sinusitis. Results There was a significant positive correlation between the pattern standard deviation (dB) and Lund-Mackay score (P = 0.031). Nasal retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, average, minimum, superotemporal, superior, superonasal, and inferonasal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness were negatively correlated significantly with Lund-Mackay score (all, P < 0.05). Eyes with grade 2 opacification of the posterior ethmoid sinus showed a significantly lower mean deviation (dB) and higher pattern standard deviation (dB) than those with clear respective sinuses (P = 0.007 and <0.001, respectively). Eyes with grades 1,2 and 3 opacification of the sphenoid sinus had a significantly less average RNFL thickness (P = 0.004, <0.001, and <0.001, respectively) and a significantly less average GCIPL thickness (P = 0.004, 0.003, and 0.003, respectively) than those with a clear sphenoid sinus. Conclusions Structural and functional optic nerve changes were correlated with the severity of chronic sinusitis. Inflammation of the posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses was associated with optic nerve changes to a greater extent than that of the other paranasal sinuses."

Two blinded readers independently evaluated DECT, gray-scale CT images (reference standard) and corresponding standardized radiographs for the presence/location of dense soft tissue deposits.Interreader agreement for detection of soft tissue deposits with DECT and radiographs was excellent (DECT: both readers, κ = 1; radiographs: both readers, κ = 0.94). DECT showed soft tissue deposits in 54/77 DECT (70%) scans. 30/54 scans (56%) showed deposits on the corresponding radiographs, while in 24 scans (44%) no deposits were seen on radiographs. Test performance of radiographs for soft tissue deposit detection: sensitivity 56%, specificity 100%, PPV 100%, NPV 48.9%, and accuracy 69%. Low density of the deposits was the main reasons for false-negative radiographs (19 cases, 79%), followed by superimposition of deposits by osseous structures (5 cases, 21%).Conventional radiographs of the hand, foot and ankle cannot serve as a gatekeeper test for reliable exclusion of radiopaque soft tissue deposits prior to DECT."
https://openalex.org/W2978661159,"Steel fiber is one of the most widely used reinforcements to improve the performance of concrete members. However, few studies have been proposed to study the seismic performance of bridge piers constructed with steel fiber reinforced concrete. This paper presents the collapse vulnerability assessment of typical single bridge piers constructed with steel fibers. Fiber element models of RC bridge piers with and without steel fibers are firstly built by selecting suitable cyclic constitutive laws of steel fiber reinforced concrete, and then calibrated using the experimental results. The seismic capacity and inelastic demand of RC piers with steel fibers are quantified using both nonlinear static pushover analyses and nonlinear incremental dynamic analyses (IDA). In order to conduct the IDA, a suite of 20 earthquake ground motions are selected and scaled to different levels of peak ground acceleration (PGA). Collapse fragility curves are then generated using the maximum drift ratio of piers as the engineering demand parameter (EDP). In order to investigate the impact of various parameters on the collapse fragility curves, six parameters are considered in the parametric study: peak compressive strength of concrete, yield strength of steel, longitudinal reinforcement ratio, axial load ratio, transverse hoops ratio and steel fiber content. It was observed that the concrete strength, longitudinal reinforcement ratio and steel fiber content could significantly affect the collapse fragility curve of the bridge piers with steel fibers."

All T7-like RNAPs, whose crystal structures have been determined so far, consist of the amino (N)-terminal and the polymerase domains. The polymerase domain contains highly conserved elements and motifs that participate in the basic function of RNA synthesis such as NTP binding and selection as well as catalysis of nucleotidyl transfer reaction. However, the N-terminal domains and inserts found in T7-like RNAPs show surprising diversity, resulting in wide range of molecular masses (70–110 kDa) (18Willis S.H. Kazmierczak K.M. Carter R.H. Rothman-Denes L.B. N4 RNA polymerase II, a heterodimeric RNA polymerase with homology to the single-subunit family of RNA polymerases.J.

Because synthesis of a faithful RNA copy of DNA remains the priority function for all T7-like RNAPs, their size differences may stem from the optimization of gene expression in their working environments. For this reason, structural studies of distantly related members of this family are important for understanding the link between architecture of RNAPs and their functional fitness. A comparative structure–function analysis of the family members requires a suitable reference, a minimum functional RNAP that possesses only a basic set of functional elements.

Studies of several members of T7-like RNAPs have shown that, indeed, aside from the catalysis of RNA synthesis, their capabilities in RNA transcription-related functions during the initiation, elongation, and termination vary dramatically. The most drastic variations occur during the transcription initiation step. Based on the abilities to recognize promoter and unwind double-strand DNA, members of T7-like family can be grouped into either the transcription factor–independent or –dependent RNAPs (20Lenneman B.R. Rothman-Denes L.B. Structural and biochemical investigation of bacteriophage N4-encoded RNA polymerases.Biomolecules. 2015; 5 (25924224): 647-66710.3390/biom5020647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). RNAPs of T7 and other closely related phages are transcription factor–independent and capable of recognizing, binding, and unwinding promoter DNA to initiate RNA synthesis on their own (21Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Insights into transcription: structure and function of single-subunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases.Curr. Opin. Struct.

The other members of the family from phages, eukaryotic organelles mitochondria, and chloroplasts are transcription factor–dependent and are unable to start RNA synthesis from promoters without their specific transcription initiation factors (20Lenneman B.R. Rothman-Denes L.B.

Coliphage N4 genome encodes two members of T7-like enzymes including the vRNAP and the RNAPII for expression of the early and middle genes of N4 phage genome, respectively (23Rothman-Denes L.B. Schito G.C. Novel transcribing activities in N4-infected Escherichia coli.Virology. 1974; 60 (4601458): 65-7210.1016/0042-6822(74)90366-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 24vander Laan K.

The N4 RNAPII has a heterodimeric architecture comprising the gp15 and gp16 subunits and represents a small group of heterodimeric enzymes within the family of T7-like RNAPs (20Lenneman B.R. Rothman-Denes L.B. Structural and biochemical investigation of bacteriophage N4-encoded RNA polymerases.Biomolecules. 2015; 5 (25924224): 647-66710.3390/biom5020647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Several features distinguish RNAPII from other members, making it an interesting subject for structure–function studies. First, the molecular mass of N4 RNAPII (70 kDa) is one of the smallest in the T7-like enzymes; accordingly, studying its structure could reveal minimum structural requirements for performing basic RNAP functions such as DNA binding, catalysis of RNA synthesis, and transcript elongation. Second, RNAPII is a heterodimeric enzyme containing gp15 and gp16 subunits. Studying structure and function of the naturally heterodimeric RNAPII addresses the long-standing question of the way of splitting a single-subunit RNAP to functional modules, i.e. separating parts of the enzyme required for catalysis and formation of promoter-bound initiation complex. Third, promoter-specific transcription of N4 RNAPII requires transcription factors gp1 and gp2 for unwinding promoter DNA and recruiting RNAPII to single-stranded DNA, respectively (20Lenneman B.R. Rothman-Denes L.B. Structural and biochemical investigation of bacteriophage N4-encoded RNA polymerases.Biomolecules. 2015; 5 (25924224): 647-66710.3390/biom5020647Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These factors are not related to any transcription factors in the mtRNAP transcription system (TFA and TFB2 in human and Mtf1 in yeast) (25Carter R.H. Demidenko A.A. Hattingh-Willis S. Rothman-Denes L.B. Phage N4 RNA polymerase II recruitment to DNA by a single-stranded DNA-binding protein.Genes Dev. 2003; 17 (12975320): 2334-234510.1101/gad.1121403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the X-ray crystal structures of N4 RNAPII in complex with promoter DNA (PDB ID: 6DT7) and engaged in the transcript elongation (PDB IDs: 6DT8 and 6DTA) for expanding our understanding of the evolution of the T7-like RNAPs. We initially attempted to crystallize the apo-form N4 RNAPII but could not find conditions that produce crystals. We therefore aimed to crystallize RNAPII in complex with promoter DNA. RNAPII cannot bind and initiate transcription from double-stranded promoter DNA without transcription factors gp1 and gp2. However, RNAPII can bind and initiate transcription without these factors from single-stranded DNA (25Carter R.H. Demidenko A.A. Hattingh-Willis S. Rothman-Denes L.B. Phage N4 RNA polymerase II recruitment to DNA by a single-stranded DNA-binding protein.Genes Dev. 2003; 17 (12975320): 2334-234510.1101/gad.1121403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We designed and tested a consensus N4 middle promoter DNA template (“Experimental Procedures”) that lacks a fragment of the nontemplate strand to mimic a melted DNA bubble around the transcription start site (Fig. 1A) (26Abravaya K. Rothman-Denes L.B. In vitro requirements for N4 RNA polymerase II-specific initiation.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264 (2663865): 12695-12699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding of RNAPII to this DNA was confirmed by a native gel mobility shift assay (Fig. S1A). In vitro transcription assay shows that the RNAPII initiates transcription with this template from two separated locations: at the major and the minor sites, the latter is 3 bp upstream from the major site (5′-GTCCACCC-3′, where start sites are underlined) (Fig. S1B). Transcription from the major site resulted in synthesis of 3-mer GGG and longer poly-G transcripts, produced by transcription slippage as dominant RNA products from this template even in the presence of both GTP and UTP (Fig. S1B, lanes 1 and 2). The minor site produces RNA transcripts containing UMP residues at their third positions (GGU, GGUG, or GGUGG) and, thereby, having different mobility as compared with the transcripts initiated from the major site (Fig. S1B, lane 1). In the structure of N4 RNAPII and DNA complex described later, a DNA base responsible for the transcription initiation at the major site positions at the i site of RNAP active site. Hereafter, DNA bases located downstream and upstream from the major transcription start site DNA base are counted as +1, +2, etc., and −1, −2, etc., respectively. We crystallized the RNAPII–DNA binary complex and determined its structure at 2.35 Å resolution (Table S1). The high-quality electron density map completely covers both subunits of RNAPII and the segment of DNA located in the DNA-binding channel of RNAPII. The structure of N4 RNAPII resembles a “right hand” in a grasping conformation that accommodates the single-stranded region of DNA. Approximate dimensions of the RNAPII–DNA complex are 80 Å × 71 Å × 65 Å. Although RNAPII is composed of two subunits, its overall shape is similar to that of T7 RNAP (Fig. 1B). The structural alignment between the N4 RNAPII and the T7 RNAP (PDB ID: 1CEZ) (6Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Structure of a transcribing T7 RNA polymerase initiation complex.Science. 1999; 286 (10600732): 2305-230910.1126/science.286.5448.2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) allowed for clear identification of the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the polymerase domain, including the Thumb, Palm and Finger subdomains (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S2). We also identified the structural elements of RNAPII such as the specificity loop in the Fingers as well as the AT-rich DNA sequence recognition motif and the intercalating β-hairpin in the NTD based on their structural homologies with those elements in the T7 RNAP (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S2). In the crystal structure, almost all traceable residues of DNA (−8 to +2) locate inserted into the catalytic cleft of the enzyme (Fig. 2, A and B). The upstream duplex and the 5′ terminal residue are disordered. The orientation of DNA in the complex suggests that the upstream duplex may not interact with the specificity loop or AT-rich recognition motif of RNAPII (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2). The majority of RNAPII-DNA interactions are not DNA sequence specific. The T7 RNAP can be physically split at the junction between the NTD (residues 1–179) and the polymerase domains (residues 180–880), and the functional recombinant T7 RNAP can be assembled in vivo and in vitro by mixing these two recombinant polypeptides (27Shis D.L. Bennett M.R. Library of synthetic transcriptional AND gates built with split T7 RNA polymerase mutants.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110 (23479654): 5028-503310.1073/pnas.1220157110Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Unlike the synthetic split version of T7 RNAP, the naturally split N4 RNAPII uses an alternative approach to form a functional RNAP with two polypeptides. Thus, gp15 subunit comprises the NTD together with the Thumb and a short segment of the Palm, whereas gp16 contains the rest of subdomains including the Palm and Fingers (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. S2). We also note that the binding interface between gp15 and gp16 is represented mostly by charged patches (Fig. S3A), which is, likely, important for enabling solubility of the subunits before dimerization. Splitting T7 RNAP in a manner of RNAPII results in exposing hydrophobic patches on their dimerization surfaces, making such synthetic subunits prone to aggregation (Fig. S3B). Dimerization of subunits gp15 and gp16 involves two binding interfaces. The main dimerization surface is formed by a bundle of structural elements, including α-helices, short β-strands, and segments of unstructured loops (Fig. 2A), making nine pairs of polar contacts (Asp162–Arg257, Arg166–Asp260, Asp177–Tyr53, Arg238–His245, Gly239–Arg253, Arg240–Asp248, Gln251–Thr339, Glu264–His336, and Glu266–Ile68, between gp15 and gp16 residues, correspondingly). Other residues on the dimerization interfaces also engage in a number of hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. The orientation of constituent elements of the gp15 dimerization surface relative to those in the corresponding dimerization surface of gp16 is close to perpendicular. The second smaller dimerization site lies on the interface between the NTD and the specificity loop. This interaction includes four polar contacts (Arg72–Glu214, Gln79–His217, Asp101–Lys221, and Asp101–Tyr223, in gp15 and gp16, correspondingly) and a hydrophobic interaction between the side chains of Phe96 and Phe103 in the NTD and Phe218 in the specificity loop. The specificity loops of T7 RNAP and N4 vRNAP are positively charged and insert into the major groove of DNA to recognize DNA sequences during the RNAP–promoter DNA complex formation (Fig. 2B) (5Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

DNA recognition requires substantial flexibility of the specificity loop and in part depends on its length. Accordingly, the specificity loops of the T7 RNAP and N4 vRNAP are long and flexible, suitable for establishing the DNA base-specific interaction. In contrast, the specificity loop of the N4 RNAPII is mostly negatively charged (Fig. 2B) and rigid because of interaction with the NTD (Fig. 2A), arguing against its role in DNA sequence recognition during the promoter DNA complex formation. The NTDs of T7 RNAP and N4 vRNAP function as platforms for promoter DNA recognition and unwinding (5Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A.

Shapes and electrostatic potentials of the NTD provide complementary surfaces for specific binding of the double-stranded and hairpin forms of promoter DNA in T7 RNAP and N4 vRNAP, respectively. Particularly, the AT-rich recognition motif and the intercalating β-hairpin of these RNAPs are separated by a significant distance for recognizing promoter sequence and DNA unwinding. In contrast, the NTD of N4 RNAPII (gp15 residues 1–168) is substantially smaller in size and the AT-rich recognition motif and the intercalating β-hairpin locate closer to each other, indicating that these elements are not suitable for the promoter DNA binding or unwinding (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2). The polymerase domain of RNAPII harbors a deep cleft for template DNA binding; the bottom of the cleft possesses conserved motifs (A, B, and DXXGR motifs), including two conserved Asp residues of the Palm (gp15 residues 226–269; gp16 residues 1–90 and 245–404) for coordinating catalytic Mg ions (Fig. 3A). The Palm has a 71-residue insertion (Palm insertion) located in the back of the active site (Fig. 1, C and D), but its function is unknown. The N-terminal part of the Fingers subdomain contains seven α-helices and four β-strands (Fig. 1D), including the motif B (RX3KX7YG) for binding NTP during the RNA synthesis. A structural analysis of T7-like RNAPs revealed that the enzymes fall into two classes based on their sizes of O/Y-helices in the Fingers. T7 RNAP and N4 vRNAP contain long O/Y-helices touching Thumbs, whereas N4 RNAPII and mtRNAP have short O/Y-helices unable to interact with Thumbs. In case of hmtRNAP, transcription factor TFB2M binds in between the Fingers and Thumb, trapping the nontemplate DNA in the initiation complex (17Hillen H.S. Parshin A.V. Agaronyan K. Morozov Y.I. Graber J.J. Chernev A. Schwinghammer K. Urlaub H. Anikin M. Cramer P. Temiakov D. Mechanism of transcription anti-termination in human mitochondria.Cell. 2017; 171 (29033127): 1082-1093.e101310.1016/j.cell.2017.09.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the N4 transcription factor gp2 plays a similar role in the open complex formation of the N4 RNAPII transcription, it may also locate in between the Fingers and Thumb of the N4 RNAPII. The C-terminal part of the Fingers contains the specificity loop, which contacts the NTD to form a circle of about 20 Å in diameter. The opening is positively charged, and it locates suitable for passing single-stranded RNA, suggesting its function as the RNA exit pore (Fig. 3B, right). The template-strand (TS) DNA enters the catalytic cleft through a narrow passage formed by the NTD and the Thumb (Fig. 1C). The RNAPII surfaces around the passage and along the entire length of TS DNA inside the catalytic cleft are positively charged (Fig. 3B, left). The catalytic cleft fits eight DNA bases (−6 to +2) (Fig. 1C). The −6C base at the 3′ end of TS DNA forms a stacking interaction with His59 residue of the NTD (Fig. 3, A and B) and following bases until −3 position faces toward the RNA exit pore. There is a sharp turn between bases −3 and −2, which sets the base stacking profile further downstream to the residue +2 (Fig. 3A). There are extensive interactions between RNAP and DNA from −2 to +2 positions (Fig. 3C) that place DNA bases toward the NTP-binding sites (i and i+1 sites) at the active site of RNAP. Particularly, DNA bases from −1 to +2 adopt an A-form helical conformation ready for base pairing with incoming nucleotides (Fig. 3A). We reconstituted functional elongation complexes of RNAPII by binding DNA:RNA scaffolds that mimic natural nucleic acid components of an elongation complex to the enzyme (scaffolds 1 and 2, “Experimental Procedures”). Initially, we tested the assembly of an elongation complex using the DNA:RNA scaffold made of the N4 promoter template (Fig. 1A) and an 8-mer RNA primer annealed to the single-stranded region of the TS DNA. However, the resulting elongation complex failed to produce crystals. To overcome this problem, we first crystallized binary complexes of RNAPII with DNA templates from scaffolds 1 and 2, and then soaked corresponding RNA primers into preformed crystals. Binding of RNA primers to DNA templates in crystals was confirmed by 5′ end labeling of nucleic acids in washed crystals with 32P (not shown). To explore the mechanism of RNA extension in RNAPII elongation complex, crystals containing the scaffold 2 were additionally soaked in a solution supplemented with Mg2+ and the next incoming nucleotide GTP. The overall geometry and conformation of RNAPII in the elongation complexes remains essentially unchanged as compared with the binary complex (Fig. 4A) except for disordering of the Thumb's tip (Fig. 4B). The catalytic cleft of RNAPII is occupied by the DNA:RNA hybrid with the 5′ end of RNA located near the proposed RNA exit pore (Figs. 4C and 5, A and C) and the 3′ end of RNA located at the i site of the active site, indicating that the elongation complexes are in the posttranslocated state. (Fig. 5, A and C). The reconstituted RNAPII elongation complexes contained DNA:RNA hybrids of different traceable lengths (Fig. 5). In the elongation complex assembled with the scaffold 1 and 12-mer RNA (EC1), the electron density is traceable for 6 bp of the DNA:RNA hybrid (Fig. 5, A and B, and Fig. S4). In the elongation complex assembled with the scaffold 2 and 8-mer RNA plus GTP, the DNA:RNA hybrid is traceable for 7 bp (Fig. 5, C and D, and Fig. S4). The electron density map also shows a GTP bound at the i+1 site base paired with the TS DNA base (Fig. 5, C and D, and Fig. S4). GTP is not incorporated into the RNA as indicated by the presence of the triphosphate group in GTP and a 4.8 Å distance from its α phosphate to the 3′ OH group of RNA not optimal for catalysis (Fig. 5, C and D). Apparently, despite the correct binding of GTP at the i+1 site, RNAPII-binding restraints disable catalysis in crystallo. In both elongation complexes RNA primers were designed to anneal to the same DNA segment forming DNA:RNA hybrids of the same length. The observed difference in the traceable lengths of the DNA:RNA hybrids may be attributed to topological restraints of accommodation of the longer 5′ end of 12-mer RNA in the crystalline RNAPII transcription complex. We speculate that the 5′ end of 12-mer RNA is unable to effic"

Our primary interest here is to reveal the characteristics of the nanoenvironment formed by both PSSEs and their surrounding amino acid residues (AARs), which might contribute to the general understanding of how proteins fold. The characteristics of such nanoenvironments must be specific to each secondary structure element, and we have set our goal here to gather the fullest possible description of the α-helical nanoenvironment. In general, this postulate (the existence of specific nanoenvironments for specific protein substructures/neighbourhoods/regions with distinct functionality) was already successfully explored and confirmed for some protein regions, such as protein-protein interfaces and enzyme catalytic sites. Consequently, PSSEs were the obvious next choice for additional work for further evidence showing that specific nanoenvironments (having characteristics fully describable by means of structural and physical chemical descriptors) do exist for the corresponding and determined intraprotein regions. The nanoenvironment of α-helices (nEoαH) is defined as any region of the protein where this secondary structure element type is detected. The nEoαH, therefore, includes not only the α-helix amino acid residues but also the residues immediately around the α-helix. The hypothesis that motivated this work is that it might in fact be possible to detect a postulated ""signal"" or ""signature"" that distinguishes the specific location of α-helices. This ""signal"" must be discernible by tracking differences in the values of physical, chemical, physicochemical, structural and geometric descriptors immediately before (or after) the PSSE from those in the region along the α-helices. The search for this specific nanoenvironment ""signal"" was made possible by aligning previously selected α-helices of equal length. Afterward, we calculated the average value, standard deviation and mean square error at each aligned residue position for each selected descriptor. We applied Student's t-test, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and MANOVA statistical tests to the dataset constructed as described above, and the results confirmed that the hypothesized ""signal""/""signature"" is both existing/identifiable and capable of distinguishing the presence of an α-helix inside the specific nanoenvironment, contextualized as a specific region within the whole protein. However, such conclusion might rarely be reached if only one descriptor is considered at a time. A more accurate signal with broader coverage is achieved only if one applies multivariate analysis, which means that several descriptors (usually approximately 10 descriptors) should be considered at the same time. To a limited extent (up to a maximum of 15% of cases), such conclusion is also possible with only a single descriptor, and the conclusion is also possible in general for up to 50-80% of cases when no less than 5 nonlinear descriptors are selected and considered. Using all the descriptors considered in this work, provided all assumptions about data characteristics for this analysis are met, multivariate analysis regularly reached a coverage and accuracy above 90%. Understanding how secondary structure elements are formed and maintained within a protein structure could enable a more detailed understanding of how proteins reach their final 3D structure and consequently, their function. Likewise, this knowledge may also improve the tools used to determine how good a structure is by means of comparing the ""signal"" around a selected PSSE with the one obtained from the best (resolution and quality wise) protein structures available."
https://openalex.org/W2829165801,"The starting point of a new generation in sexually reproducing species is fertilization. In many species, fertilization is followed by cell divisions controlled primarily by maternal transcripts, with little to no zygotic transcription. The activation of the zygotic genome (ZGA) is part of a process called maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), during which transcripts from the zygotic genome take control of development, setting the conditions for cellular specialization. While we know that epigenetic processes (e.g. methylation) are involved in the MZT, their roles and interplay in the transition are largely unknown. I developed a model and used simulations to elucidate the interaction between possible epigenetic processes, namely methylation processes, involved in the MZT. The model focuses on the dynamics of global methylation levels and how these interact with factors such as a parental repressor and the nucleocytoplasmic ratio to trigger the ZGA, followed by development from fertilization to adulthood. In addition, I included transgenerational effects transmitted to the zygote from both parents through their gametes to show that these may set the stage for plastic developmental processes. I demonstrate that the rates of maintenance methylation and demethylation, which are important for the achievement of the final methylation levels of an individual, exhibit a certain level of flexibility in terms of parameter values. I find that high final methylation levels require more restricted combinations of parameter values. The model is discussed in the context of the current empirical knowledge and provide suggestions for directions of future empirical and theoretical studies."
