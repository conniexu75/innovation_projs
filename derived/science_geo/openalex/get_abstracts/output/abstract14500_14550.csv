https://openalex.org/W1520348962,"A triglyceride lipase different from lipoprotein lipase, but measurable only after intravenous heparin injection, has been isolated from human plasma by sequential use of heparin-Sepharose and concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Using these procedures, phospholipase A1 activity was found to chromatograph identically with the triglyceride lipase. The constancy of the ratio of activities after isoelectric focusing (pI 4.1) and during thermal deactivation indicates that this enzyme has hydrolase activity against both triglycerides and phospholipids. This conclusion was supported further by the homogeneity of the protein as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W1533140015,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of notexin, a presynaptic neurotoxin from the venom of Notechis scutatus scutatus (Australian tiger snake), has been elucidated. The protein consists of a single chain of 119 amino acids cross-linked by seven disulfide bridges and has a formula weight of 13,578. The main fragmentation of the peptide chain was accomplished with a staphylococcal protease specific for glutamoyl bonds. A cyanogen bromide fragment and tryptic peptides were used to align the five major staphylococcal protease peptides. The sequence was determined by Edman degradation using the direct phenylthiohydantoin method and with carboxypeptidase A. Notexin is shown to be homologous to both porcine pancreatic phospholipase A and a phospholipase A from the venom of Naja melanoleuca."

https://openalex.org/W1490323004,"Preparative agarose gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions has been successfully employed to purify large quantities of ovalbumin mRNA from hen oviducts. The mRNA thus prepared is physically homogeneous based on its migration as a single component on electrophoresis in both analytical acid-urea agarose gels and formamide-containing, neutral polyacrylaminde gels; it also sediments as a single peak in sucrose gradients containing 70% formamide. The mRNA is chemically free of ribosomal RNA contamination since its oligonucleotide fingerprint map after complete T1 ribonuclease digestion contains no detectable specific large oligonucleotide markers of ribosomal RNAs. It is also not contaminated by other biologically active messenger RNAs because, when it is added to the cell-free wheat germ translation system, the only protein product synthesized is ovalbumin as analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and specific immunoprecipitation. Ovalbumin mRNA has a nucleotide composition of 32.3% A, 21.0% G, 25.7% U, and 20.7% C [(A+U)/(G+C) equal 1.41]. The mRNA contains a heterogeneous poly(A) tract ranging from 20 to 140 residues with a number average chain length of 62 adenylate residues. The molecular weight of the sodium salt of the purified mRNA is approximately 650,000 +/- 63,000, corresponding to a chain length of 1890 +/- 180 nucleotides, as determined by electron microscopy under completely denaturing conditions. This value is in close agreement with the values obtained from: (a) sucrose gradient centrifugation in the presence of 70% formamide; (b) evaluation of poly(A) content in the mRNA and the number average chain length of its poly(A) tract; and (c) sedimentation velocity studies in the presence of 3% formaldehyde. When 125I-labeled ovalbumin mRNA is allowed to hybridize with a large excess of chick DNA, the observed kinetics of hybridization reveal no appreciable reaction between the mRNA and the repeated sequences of the chick DNA, although the mRNA appears to be approximately 600 nucleotides longer than necessary to code for ovalbumin. It thus appears that the entire ovalbumin mRNA is primarily transcribed from a unique sequence in the chick genome."

https://openalex.org/W1548762358,"The total degradation of heparin by the joint action of a purified heparinase and a heparitinase from Flavobacterium heparinum is reported. The heparinase acts directly upon heparin, yielding 52% of a trisulfated disaccharide (O-(alpha-L-ido-4-enepyranosyluronic acid 2-sulfate)-(1leads to 4)-2sulfoamino-2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-sulfate) and 40% of a tetrasaccharide besides small amounts of hexa- and disaccharides. The tetrasaccharide is in turn completely degraded by the heparitinase, forming trisulfated disaccharide and disulfated disaccharide (O-(alpha-D-glyco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-(1leads to 4)-2-sulfoamino-2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-sulfate) in equal amounts. These and other results indicate that the tri- and disulfated disaccharides are linked alternately, in a proportion of 3:1, respectively. The primary structure of heparin and the mode of action of the heparinase and the heparitinase are proposed based on the analysis of the different products formed by the action of the enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1523474429,"Omega-Cyclohexyl undecanoic acid and omega-cyclohexyl tridecanoic acid were found in 10 strains of acido-thermophilic bacteria isolated from different Japanese hot springs. These unusual fatty acids were found in the esterified form in glyceride type complex lipids and constituted 74 to 93% of the total fatty acids in the bacteria. The fatty acids other than omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids found were 14-methyl hexadecanoic acid (3 to 15%) and 15-methyl hexadecanoic acid (1 to 6%), and trace amounts of straight chain and methyl-branched tetra- and penta-decanoic acids. Biosynthesis of omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids increased with increase in the concentration of glucose in the culture medium. The metabolism of omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids was studied using deuterium-labeled precursors by mass fragmentation analysis. The deuterium of [2-D]glucose was specifically incorporated into position 2 of the cyclohexyl ring of the fatty acids, indicating that the ring was synthesized from the glucose molecule. Radioactivity was efficiently incorporated into the omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids from labeled glucose, shikimate, and cyclohexyl carboxylate. These findings indicate that omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids are synthesized with glucose through shikimic acid and probably cyclohexyl carboxylyl-CoA derivative as the intermediates."

https://openalex.org/W1489250363,"D-Amino acid aminotransferase, purified to homogeneity and crystallized from Bacillus sphaericus, has a molecular weight of about 60,000 and consists of two subunits identical in molecular weight (30,000). The enzyme exhibits absorption maxima at 280, 330, and 415 nm, which are independent of the pH (5.5 to 10.0), and contains 2 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per mol of enzyme. One of the pyridoxal-5'-P, absorbing at 415 nm, is bound in an aldimine linkage to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue of the protein, and is released by incubation with phenylhydrazine to yield the catalytically inactive form. The inactive form, which is reactivated by addition of pyridoxal 5'phosphate, still has a 330 nm peak and contains 1 mol of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Therefore, this form is regarded as a semiapoenzyme. The holoenzyme shows negative circular dichroic bands at 330 and 415 nm. D-Amino acid aminotransferase catalyzes alpha transamination of various D-amino acids and alpha-keto acids. D-Alanine, D-alpha-aminobutyrate and D-glutamate, and alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and alpha-ketobutyrate are the preferred amino donors and acceptors, respectively. The enzyme activity is significantly affected by both the carbonyl and sulfhydryl reagents. The Michaelis constants are as follows: D-alanine (1.3 and 4.2 mM with alpha-ketobutyrate and alpha-ketoglutarate, respictively), alpha-ketobutyrate (14 mM withD-alanine), alpha-ketoglutarate (3.4 mM with D-alanine), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (2.3 muM) and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (25 muM)."
https://openalex.org/W1573609576,"Follicle-stimulating hormone of a high state of physicochemical and biological purity was isolated from acetone-preserved human pituitary glands. The follicle-stimulating hormone was dissociated into alpha and beta subunits by treatment with 8 M urea and the subunits were separated by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25. The subunits were freed of undissociated or reassociated follicle-stimulating hormone by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100. For the establishment of the primary amino acid sequence, the alpha subunit was reduced and either carboxyamidomethylated or S-aminoethylated prior to a thermolytic or a tryptic digestion. Each digest was gel filtered on a column of Sephadex G-50 to separate the glycopeptides from the peptides. The glycopeptides and the peptides were purified further by sequential gel filtration on Sephadex G-25, G-15, and Bio-Gel-P-2 and were isolated by high voltage electrophoresis at pH 6, 3.5, and 2. The purity of the isolated peptides was ascertained further by amino acid analysis. The amino acid sequences of the peptides were determined by Edman degradation followed by subtractive amino acid analysis. COOH-terminal sequences were established by digestion with carboxypeptidases A and B. The primary amino acid sequence of human follicle-stimulating hormone-alpha is identical to that of human chorionic gonadotropin-alpha and differs from that of human luteinizing hormone-alpha in having the tripeptide Ala-Pro-Asx- at the NH2-terminal end."
https://openalex.org/W1492271309,"A particulate enzyme from bovine aorta catalyzes the incorporation of mannose from GDP-D-[14C]mannose into three products as follows: 1. Most of the radioactivity which is incorporated in short term incubations is into a product that is soluble in CHCl3/CH3OH (2/1, v/v). This product was purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex LH-20. The purified glycolipid was stable to alkaline saponification but released [14C]mannose when subjected to mild acid hydrolysis (1/2 = 7 min at 100 degrees in 0.01 N HCl). The purified glycolipid had the same mobility on silica gel plates in an acidic, basic, or neutral solvent system as did glycolipid had the same mobility on silica gel plates in an acidic, basic, or neutral solvent system as did authentic dolichyl mannopyranosyl phosphate. The synthesis of the 14C-mannolipid was reversed by the addition of GDP and Mg2+. 2. [14C]mannose is also incorporated, although at a slower rate into products which are soluble in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (1/1/0.3, v/v). When the 1/10.3 soluble material was chromatographed on Avicel plates, it gave rise to three distinct radioactive bands which appear to be lipid-linked oligosaccharides. Mild acid hydrolysis of the 1/10.3 soluble material released water-soluble, neutral 14C-oligosaccharides which eluted from Sephadex G-50 in two or three peaks between the standards cytochrome c and GDP-mannose..."
https://openalex.org/W1563742311,"In the presence of a procoagulant fraction (Echis carinatus procoagulant) isolated from the venom of the saw-scaled viper Echis carinatus sochureki, purified human prothrombin (P1) is completely converted to thrombin. The first step is the removal of an NH2-terminal peptide (F1) representing approximately one-third of the prothrombin molecule. The remaining peptide (P2) is then cleaved by the action of E.c. procoagulant to yield a two-chain, disulfide-bridged protein (P'2) which has the same molecular weight as P2. P'2 has enzymic (thrombin) activity, as evidence by incorporation of radiolabeled diisopropylphosphate into its heavy chain (TB), hydrolysis of p-toluenesulfonylarginine methyl ester, and clotting of fibrinogen. Relative to thrombin, its esterolytic activity greatly exceeds its clot-promoting activity. Examination of the polypeptide chains obtained by reducing P'2 has shown that its larger chain (TB) is indistinguishable from the heavy chain of thrombin. Its other chain (F2TA) consists of the light chain (TA) of thrombin bound by peptide linkage to the protion of the prothrombin molecule which had been adjacent to F1. Removal of this portion (F2) is catalyzed by thrombin (and, evidently, by P'2), but not by the E.c. procoagulant. When F2 is removed from P'2, the remaining two-chian protein is indistinguishable from thrombin by any of the criteria applied--molecular weight, subunit chain composition, or enzymic activity. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in sodium dodecyl sulfate before and after disulfide reduction of samples generated in the presence and in the absence of diisopropylphosphorofluoridate, which inhibits thrombin but not the E.c. procoagulant. Such experiments showed that thrombin (and probably P'2), as well as E.c. procoagulant, catalyzes the release of F1. Furthermore, thrombin brings about the cleavage of F1 to yield a two-chain, disulfidebridged protein (F'1). These observations, particularly those made in the course of characterizine P'2, have led to the conclusion that cleavage of the peptide bond connecting the TA and TB portions of the prothrombin molecule (or its derivatives) produces a serine active center and, hence, a molecule possessing thrombin activity. This cleavage is catalyzed by the E.c. procoagulant but not by thrombon itself."
https://openalex.org/W1510973983,"Endogenous proteins of cell-free preparations of hen oviduct labeled from GDP-[14C]Man or from [Man-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid have been compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under the conditions tested, a polypeptide chain of molecular weight about 25,000 was the principle acceptor for the oligosaccharide moiety of exogenous [Man-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid. The product labeled by [Man-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid appeared identical with one of three glycoproteins formed when GDP-[14C]Man was incubated with a crude membrane fraction. These three proteins (apparent molecular weight of 75,000, 55,000, and 25,000) accounted for nearly two-thirds of the [14C]mannose-labeled glycoprotein products using GDP-[14C]Man and either the crude membrane fraction or a total oviduct homogenate. Thus, all of the mannose acceptor proteins present in the oviduct homogenate appear to be membrane-bound. Analyses of the [Man-14C]glycoproteins labeled from GDP-[14C]Man in membrane fractions from hen kidney, liver, brain, and oviduct indicated that a labeled polypeptide of apparent molecular weight 25,000 was the only major protein product common to the four preparations."

https://openalex.org/W1679227790,"The structure of the oligosaccharide chain of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide that serves as a donor of oligosaccharide chain to proteins of hen oviduct membranes has been investigated. A [Man-14C]glycopeptide fraction was prepared from membrane glycoproteins labeled with GDP-[14C]mannose. Reductive alkaline cleavage of this glycopeptide yielded a reduced oligosaccharide that, by four criteria, was identical with reduced [Man-14C]oligosaccharide prepared from [Man-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid. The structure of the oligosaccharide chain of the [Man-14C]glycopeptide was investigated by cleavage with a specific endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, followed by treatment of the released oligosaccharide with purified al alpha-and beta-mannosidases. By this procedure it was possible to establish the structure of the cleavage product as (alpha-Man)n-beta-Man-(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc. Similar studies were performed on the [GlcNAc-14C]oligosaccharide prepared by hydrolysis of [GlcNAc-14C]oligosaccharide-lipid. The results indicate that the structure of the intact oligosaccharide is (alpha-Man)n-beta-Man-(1 leads 4)-beta-GlcNAc-(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc. These experiments, coupled with earlier enzymatic studies on synthesis of the glycoproteins from the lipid-linked oligosaccharide, provide strong evidence that the structure of the oligosaccharide intermediate and the oligosaccharide chain of the glycoprotein product contain the same core structure found in many secretory glycoproteins."

https://openalex.org/W1564802018,"Polycations, including ribonuclease A, ribonuclease S protein and peptide, spermine, spermidine, and polylysines, enhance unstimulated and stimulated adenylate cyclase activity of beef thyroid membranes at low concentrations and inhibit these activities at high concentrations. Peak polylysine stimulation occurs with degrees of polymerization of 6 to 14, and for large polymers a potency limit for this maximum is reached at 4 X 10(-5) M expressed as lysine residues. Both enhancement and inhibition appear to be due to charge-charge interactions and are abolished by KC1. Polyanions are inhibitory only. The biphasic effect of polycations is seen on basal cyclase activity, occurs with prostaglandin E1- and 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate-stimulated cyclase, but is most striking with thyrotropin. There is little enhancement of F--activated cyclase. The enhancement is not sensitive to changes in pH, Mg2+, or regenerating system and does not correlate with the stability constants between polycations and ATP. We suggest that the polycation effect is a general, electrostatic effect on membrane conformation and is not restricted to a particular receptor domain."

https://openalex.org/W1549269540,"At low ionic strength KB cell DNA polymerase N1 forms large aggregates of a size comparable to those of DNA polymerase C. However, in contrast to polymerase C, the polymerase N1 aggregate: (a) retains the distinctive features of the polymerase N1 monomer, specifically its relative insensitivity to salt and to p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, and its pI of 9.3; and (b) is quantitatively converted to the polymerase N1 monomer form at appropriate ionic strength. It is important to recognize that since both polymerase N1 and polymerase C undergo salt-dependent association-dissociation reactions, attempts to distinguish these clearly indedependent polymerase species on the basis of size criteria can be very misleading. This is particularly true in relatively impure enzyme fractions that are generally isolated from eukaryotic tissue sources in low ionic strength buffers. We had earlier reported (Wang, T. S.-F., Sedwick, W. D., and Korn, D. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249,841-850; Sedwick, W. D., Wang, T. S.-F., and Korn, D. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247,5026-5033; Sedwick, W. D., Wang, T. S.-F., and Korn, D. (1974) Methods Enzymol. 29, 89-102) that DNA polymerase N1 could not utilize homoribopolymer templates. We have re-examined this question with a modified and more stringent method of product assay, and we show here that a greater than or equal 95% homogeneous preparation of polymerase N1 can copy the primer-template (A)n-(dT)-/16 at about one-half the rate that it copies activated DNA under optimum incubation conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1527311226,"Avian liver p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate hydroxylase (EC 1.13.11.27) was purified to a 1000-fold increase in specific activity over crude supernatant, utilizing a substrate analogue, o-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, to stabilize the enzyme. The preparation was homogeneous with respect to sedimentation with a sedimentation velocity (s20,w) of 5.3 S. The molecular weight of the enzyme was determined to be 97,000 +/- 5,000 by sedimentation equilibrium, and the molecular weight of the subunits was determined to be 49,000 +/- 3,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed heterogeneity of the purified enzyme. The multiple molecular forms were separable by isoelectric focusing, and their isoelectric points ranged from pH 6.8 to 6.0. The amino acid compositions and tryptic peptide maps of the three forms isolated by isoelectric focusing were very similar. The forms of the enzyme had the same relative activity toward p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate. Conditions which are known to accelerate nonenzymic deamidation of proteins caused interconversion of the multiple molecular forms. Iron was the only transition metal found to be associated with the purified enzyme at significant levels. The amount of enzyme-bound iron present in equilibrium-dialyzed samples was equivalent to 1 atom of iron per enzyme subunit. Purification of the enzyme activity correlated with the purification of the enzyme-bound iron. An EPR scan of the purified enzyme gave a signal at g equal 4.33, which is characteristic of ferric iron in a rhombic ligand field."
https://openalex.org/W1588881895,"The first 107 residues of Fragment C of human serum albumin have been sequenced and two positions at which affinity labels block the indole site determined. Histidine 23 is the position of blockage by bromoacetyl-L-tryptophan and lysine 67 is the position of blockage by 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride and probably pyridoxal-5'-phosphate. The presence of an indole ligand at the binding site markedly reduces incorporation of the label into the above lysyl residue, and in the case of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride, increases incorporation into three other positions, lysine residues 13, 39, and 84. It is concluded that binding of the indole ligand on the site brings about conformational changes in the albumin structure exposing new reactive positions for 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride. There is a large accumulation of basic and hydrophobic residues and no glycine, serine, threonine, valine, aspartate, or cysteine residues in the sequence 10 to 43. Lysine 71 has been identified by amino acid analyses and sequence studies as the position acetylated by acetylsalicylic acid (Hawkins, D. R., Pinckard, N., Crawford, C. P., and Farr, R. S. J. Clin. Invest. (1969) 48, 536), establishing the structural relationships of two major ligand binding sites on albumin. The lone tryptophan is at position 86. Evidence indicates that within residues 1 to 86 of Fragment C and within residues of the A-Phe fragment (Mr equals approximately 10,000), the latter known to be adjacent to Fragment C in the whole albumin structure, exists the major binding sites of all ligands for human serum albumin."

These values correspond to a free energy of binding, δG0′ (pH 7.2), of −6.21 kcal/mol and −6.06 kcal/mol at 2° and 20°, respectively. The sites appeared homogeneous and noninteracting.

https://openalex.org/W1559068016,"In teleosts glucosephosphate isomerase exists as two tissue-specific isozymes. Most tissues contain the more acidic liver-type isozyme, while white muscle contains the more basic isozyme; and a few tissues contain both the liver- and muscle-type isozymes as well as a hybird. The isozymes were isolated from catfish liver and muscle and from conger muscle and shown to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, analytical ultracentrifugation, and rechromatography. Both isozymes are of molecular weight 132,000 (S020,w = 7.0 S) and composed of two subunits of Mr approximately 65,000. The muscle and liver isozymes were shown to have distinct isoelectric points (catfish liver = 6.2; muscle = 7.0) and amino acid compositions. Tryptic peptide maps, after S-carboxymethylation and carbamylation, revealed several distinct differences in the primary structures of the isozymes. Although the isozymes could also be distinguished on the basis of their stabilities, most of their basic catalytic properties were found to be similar. A conger was obtained which was heterozygous for the variant allele at the muscle-glucosephosphate isomerase locus. A comparison of the variant conger muscle isozyme with the wild type revealed a single altered peptide, suggesting a point mutation. The structure-function studies, as well as the genetic studies, clearly establish that the two types of isozymes are of independent genetic origin."

In the half-ferric state, no heme-heme interaction was observed for Hb M Iwate, Hb M Boston, and Hb M Hyde Park, but Hb M Saskatoon and Hb M Milwaukee-I show small but definite heme-heme interaction with Hill's n of 1.3. The beta chain mutants, Hb M Hyde Park and Hb M Saskatoon, have almost normal affinity for ethylisocyanide and a normal Bohr effect, whereas the alpha chain mutants, Hb M Iwate and Hb M Boston, have abnormally low affinity and almost no Bohr effect. Hb M Milwaukee-I showed a large Bohr effect and low affinity. These results are consistent qualitatively with those on oxygen equilibria reported previously. In the fully reduced state, in which all four hemes were in the ferrous state and capable of binding ethylisocyanide distinct differences were found in the extent of heme-heme interaction. Namely, the n values for proximal histidine mutants, Hb M Iwate and Hb M Hyde Park, were 1.1 and 1.0, respectively, whereas the distal histidine mutants, Hb M Boston and Hb M Saskatoon, showed high n values of 2.4 and 1.6, respectively. Hb M Milwaukee-I also exhibited a high n value of 2.0 The ethylisocyanide affinity of the four histidine mutants was high compared with that of Hb A, while that for Hb M Milwaukee-I was almost normal. All five Hbs M had approximately normal magnitudes of Bohr effect. In the half-ferric state, the proximal and distal histidine mutants of the same chain showed similar affinity for ethylisocyanide and Bohr effect, rather different from those of the mutants of the opposite chain. These differences seem to be derived from the difference of abnormal bonding of ferric iron to tyrosine or glutamic acid. On the other hand, the reduction of iron, which abolished the abnormal bonding and made all of the chains capable of binding ligand, extinguished the differences of alpha and beta chains, and the effect of amino acid side chains close to iron on ligand binding properties became clear. Proximal histidine, which is considered to trigger the transition between the T and R states, seems to be essential to the heme-heme interaction."

These scissions are due to the presence of covalently linked ribonucleotides in these closed circular DNAs. By comparing the scission rates of these ctDNAs to the scission rate of RNA, it has been estimated that pea and spinach ctDNAs contain a maximum of 18 +/- 2 ribonucleotides/molecule, while lettuce ctDNA contains a maximum of 12 +/- 2 ribonucleotides/molecule. Further studies with pea ctDNA by electron microscopic methods have shown that pea ctDNA contains 19 alkali-labile sites at specific locations. A map of the relative positions of the alkali-labile sites has been constructed. These alkali-labile sites are presumably due to the insertion of individual ribonucleotides."

No large differences in protein conformation were observed. The greatest density of structural differences was found in the heme region. There was a loss of the histidine-bound sulfate ion and of the metal-bound water molecule, as well as a shift in the position of the prosthetic group with associated changes in the adjacent globin. The structural changes resulting from the substitution of ethyl for the vinyl side chains of the porphyrin were clearly observed. There was also a suggestion of a conformational change of the porphyrin ring. It was not clear whether there was any change of the metal position relative to the porphyrin plane or proximal histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1548863518,"In Pseudomonas saccharophila 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate-6-P aldolase (EC 4.1.2.21) is induced by growth on galatose while 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-P aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14) is constitutive. These enzymes catalyze identical reactions except for the configuration fixed at C-4 during the condensation reaction. It was found with each enzyme that in a condensation between [3-3H3]pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-P, the respective condensation products were formed 8 to 10 times faster than tritium was released to water. Since pyruvate deprotonation is obligatory for condensation, the above result requires a hydrogen isotope effect in enolpyruvate formation, which must be then at least partially rate limiting for C--C synthesis. Further, condensation between D-glyceraldehyde-3-P and (3R)-[3-3H, 2H,H]pyruvate or (3S)-[3-3H, 2H,H]pyruvate, as catalyzed by each enzyme, enriched for (3R)- and (3S)-3-3H, 2H-labeled condensation product, respectively. Thus, each enzyme catalyzes C--C and C--H synthesis with retention of configuration at C-3. This shows that the active sites of both enzymes are asymmetric since solutes can only approach a single face of the bound pyruvyl enolate. In addition, the respective aldehyde specific portions of the two active sites must have opposite chiralities, with respect to each other, for correctly orienting the carbonyl faces of the incoming D-glyceraldehyde-3-P, to generate the correct configuration at C-4 of the respective condensation products."
https://openalex.org/W1543772618,"A fractionation procedure has been developed which permits the isolation of 1 to 2 mg of homarine from a single shrimp.

The injection of L-[U-14C]aspartate resulted in labeled homarine, but the quantity converted was less than expected. Since [14C]glycerol is an effective precursor there is a possibility that quinolinic acid may be formed in P. duorarum by a condensation similar to that of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate with aspartic acid or a closely related metabolite. It is suggested that decarboxylation of quinolinic acid gives rise to picolinic acid which is methylated to yield homarine. L-[methyl-14C]Methionine efficiently provides the N-methyl carbon presumably via S-adenosylmethionine."

https://openalex.org/W1498325091,"In a condensation between [3-3H3]pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-P as catalyzed by 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-P aldolase (EC 4.1.2.14) of Pseudomonas putida, C--C synthesis occurred appreciably faster than C--3H bond breaking. Since tritium is present in tritiated pyruvate in tracer amounts, this result showed hydrogen isotope discrimination in pyruvate deprotonation and suggests enolpyruvate generation to be at least partially rate-limiting in the condensation reaction. Consequently, in a condensation reaction between [3-3H, 2H,H]pyruvate of known chirality and D-glyceraldehyde-3-P, the newly synthesized C--C bond would be enriched for at what was the C--H bond of chiral pyruvate, discriminating against the C--2H and C--3H bonds. Additional studies showed that condensations between (3S)-[3-3H, 2H,H]- or (3R)-[3-3H, 2H,H]pyruvate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-P yielded predominantly (3S)- or (3R)-2-keto-3-deoxy[3-3H, 2H]gluconate-6-P, respectively. By comparison with sterochemical models, it was concluded that condensation occurred with retention of configuration at C-3. Thus in the turnover of substrates as catalyzed by this enzyme, both the exchanging proton from water and D-glyceraldehyde-3-P attack the same face of the enzyme-bound pyruvyleneamine."
