https://openalex.org/W2161641617,"Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic influences remain elusive. We hypothesize that individually rare structural variants contribute to the illness. Microdeletions and microduplications &gt;100 kilobases were identified by microarray comparative genomic hybridization of genomic DNA from 150 individuals with schizophrenia and 268 ancestry-matched controls. All variants were validated by high-resolution platforms. Novel deletions and duplications of genes were present in 5% of controls versus 15% of cases and 20% of young-onset cases, both highly significant differences. The association was independently replicated in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia as compared with their parents. Mutations in cases disrupted genes disproportionately from signaling networks controlling neurodevelopment, including neuregulin and glutamate pathways. These results suggest that multiple, individually rare mutations altering genes in neurodevelopmental pathways contribute to schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2772222670,"T helper cells that produce IL-17 (T(H)17 cells) promote autoimmunity in mice and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory diseases. At mucosal surfaces, T(H)17 cells are thought to protect the host from infection, whereas regulatory T (T(reg)) cells control immune responses and inflammation triggered by the resident microflora. Differentiation of both cell types requires transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), but depends on distinct transcription factors: RORgammat (encoded by Rorc(gammat)) for T(H)17 cells and Foxp3 for T(reg) cells. How TGF-beta regulates the differentiation of T cells with opposing activities has been perplexing. Here we demonstrate that, together with pro-inflammatory cytokines, TGF-beta orchestrates T(H)17 cell differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations, TGF-beta synergizes with interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-21 (refs 9-11) to promote IL-23 receptor (Il23r) expression, favouring T(H)17 cell differentiation. High concentrations of TGF-beta repress IL23r expression and favour Foxp3+ T(reg) cells. RORgammat and Foxp3 are co-expressed in naive CD4+ T cells exposed to TGF-beta and in a subset of T cells in the small intestinal lamina propria of the mouse. In vitro, TGF-beta-induced Foxp3 inhibits RORgammat function, at least in part through their interaction. Accordingly, lamina propria T cells that co-express both transcription factors produce less IL-17 (also known as IL-17a) than those that express RORgammat alone. IL-6, IL-21 and IL-23 relieve Foxp3-mediated inhibition of RORgammat, thereby promoting T(H)17 cell differentiation. Therefore, the decision of antigen-stimulated cells to differentiate into either T(H)17 or T(reg) cells depends on the cytokine-regulated balance of RORgammat and Foxp3."

https://openalex.org/W2164875840,"We have developed a simple approach to high-performance, stretchable, and foldable integrated circuits. The systems integrate inorganic electronic materials, including aligned arrays of nanoribbons of single crystalline silicon, with ultrathin plastic and elastomeric substrates. The designs combine multilayer neutral mechanical plane layouts and “wavy” structural configurations in silicon complementary logic gates, ring oscillators, and differential amplifiers. We performed three-dimensional analytical and computational modeling of the mechanics and the electronic behaviors of these integrated circuits. Collectively, the results represent routes to devices, such as personal health monitors and other biomedical devices, that require extreme mechanical deformations during installation/use and electronic properties approaching those of conventional systems built on brittle semiconductor wafers."

We demonstrate high-fidelity silica-on-silicon integrated optical realizations of key quantum photonic circuits, including two-photon quantum interference with a visibility of 94.8 ± 0.5%; a controlled-NOT gate with an average logical basis fidelity of 94.3 ± 0.2%; and a path-entangled state of two photons with fidelity of &gt;92%. These results show that it is possible to directly “write” sophisticated photonic quantum circuits onto a silicon chip, which will be of benefit to future quantum technologies based on photons, including information processing, communication, metrology, and lithography, as well as the fundamental science of quantum optics."
https://openalex.org/W2114208662,"Clinical trials of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) or its receptor VEGFR1 (also called FLT1), in patients with blinding choroidal neovascularization (CNV) from age-related macular degeneration, are premised on gene silencing by means of intracellular RNA interference (RNAi). We show instead that CNV inhibition is a siRNA-class effect: 21-nucleotide or longer siRNAs targeting non-mammalian genes, non-expressed genes, non-genomic sequences, pro- and anti-angiogenic genes, and RNAi-incompetent siRNAs all suppressed CNV in mice comparably to siRNAs targeting Vegfa or Vegfr1 without off-target RNAi or interferon-α/β activation. Non-targeted (against non-mammalian genes) and targeted (against Vegfa or Vegfr1) siRNA suppressed CNV via cell-surface toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), its adaptor TRIF, and induction of interferon-γ and interleukin-12. Non-targeted siRNA suppressed dermal neovascularization in mice as effectively as Vegfa siRNA. siRNA-induced inhibition of neovascularization required a minimum length of 21 nucleotides, a bridging necessity in a modelled 2:1 TLR3–RNA complex. Choroidal endothelial cells from people expressing the TLR3 coding variant 412FF were refractory to extracellular siRNA-induced cytotoxicity, facilitating individualized pharmacogenetic therapy. Multiple human endothelial cell types expressed surface TLR3, indicating that generic siRNAs might treat angiogenic disorders that affect 8% of the world’s population, and that siRNAs might induce unanticipated vascular or immune effects. Work in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a late symptom of the age-related macular degeneration that causes blindness in humans, has resulted in a surprise finding: all small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), irrespective of target, suppress the angiogenesis involved in the condition. It is known that siRNAs against Vegfa or Vegfr1, if introduced directly into the eye, can suppress CNV. But the mechanism of this generic antiangiogenic effect does not depend on the target of the siRNA, and it does not require intraocular administration. Rather, the siRNAs activate TLR3 (toll-like receptor 3), a cell-surface receptor for long viral dsRNAs, and innate immunity. The antiangiogenic effect of siRNAs does not depend on the target of the siRNA, or on intraocular administration. Rather, the siRNAs activate TLR3, a cell surface receptor for long viral dsRNAs, and innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2017408113,"The properties of a cell are determined by the genetic information encoded in its genome. Understanding how such information is differentially and dynamically retrieved to define distinct cell types and cellular states is a major challenge facing molecular biology. Gene regulatory factors that control the expression of genomic information come in a variety of flavors, with transcription factors and microRNAs representing the most numerous gene regulatory factors in multicellular genomes. Here, I review common principles of transcription factor– and microRNA-mediated gene regulatory events and discuss conceptual differences in how these factors control gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1977937947,"The past few years have revealed that the genomes of all studied eukaryotes are almost entirely transcribed, generating an enormous number of non–protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). In parallel, it is increasingly evident that many of these RNAs have regulatory functions. Here, we highlight recent advances that illustrate the diversity of ncRNA control of genome dynamics, cell biology, and developmental programming."
https://openalex.org/W1982304014,"We report here the self-assembly of macroscopic sacs and membranes at the interface between two aqueous solutions, one containing a megadalton polymer and the other, small self-assembling molecules bearing opposite charge. The resulting structures have a highly ordered architecture in which nanofiber bundles align and reorient by nearly 90° as the membrane grows. The formation of a diffusion barrier upon contact between the two liquids prevents their chaotic mixing. We hypothesize that growth of the membrane is then driven by a dynamic synergy between osmotic pressure of ions and static self-assembly. These robust, self-sealing macroscopic structures offer opportunities in many areas, including the formation of privileged environments for cells, immune barriers, new biological assays, and self-assembly of ordered thick membranes for diverse applications."

https://openalex.org/W2037667461,"Electrons in atoms possess both spin and orbital degrees of freedom. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, these are independent, resulting in large degeneracies in atomic spectra. However, relativistic effects couple the spin and orbital motion, leading to the well-known fine structure in their spectra. The electronic states in defect-free carbon nanotubes are widely believed to be four-fold degenerate, owing to independent spin and orbital symmetries, and also to possess electron-hole symmetry. Here we report measurements demonstrating that in clean nanotubes the spin and orbital motion of electrons are coupled, thereby breaking all of these symmetries. This spin-orbit coupling is directly observed as a splitting of the four-fold degeneracy of a single electron in ultra-clean quantum dots. The coupling favours parallel alignment of the orbital and spin magnetic moments for electrons and antiparallel alignment for holes. Our measurements are consistent with recent theories that predict the existence of spin-orbit coupling in curved graphene and describe it as a spin-dependent topological phase in nanotubes. Our findings have important implications for spin-based applications in carbon-based systems, entailing new design principles for the realization of quantum bits (qubits) in nanotubes and providing a mechanism for all-electrical control of spins in nanotubes."
https://openalex.org/W2166561873,"Many viruses go through a maturation step in the final stages of assembly before being transmitted to another host. The maturation process of flaviviruses is directed by the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor membrane protein (prM), turning inert virus into infectious particles. We have determined the 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structure of a recombinant protein in which the dengue virus prM is linked to the envelope glycoprotein E. The structure represents the prM-E heterodimer and fits well into the cryo–electron microscopy density of immature virus at neutral pH. The pr peptide β-barrel structure covers the fusion loop in E, preventing fusion with host cell membranes. The structure provides a basis for identifying the stages of its pH-directed conformational metamorphosis during maturation, ending with release of pr when budding from the host."
https://openalex.org/W2089422977,Recent work has shown that the RNA polymerase II enzyme pauses at a promoter-proximal site of many genes in Drosophila and mammals. This rate-limiting step occurs after recruitment and initiation of RNA polymerase II at a gene promoter. This stage in early elongation appears to be an important and broadly used target of gene regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2028356706,"The beak of the Humboldt squid Dosidicus gigas represents one of the hardest and stiffest wholly organic materials known. As it is deeply embedded within the soft buccal envelope, the manner in which impact forces are transmitted between beak and envelope is a matter of considerable scientific interest. Here, we show that the hydrated beak exhibits a large stiffness gradient, spanning two orders of magnitude from the tip to the base. This gradient is correlated with a chemical gradient involving mixtures of chitin, water, and His-rich proteins that contain 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-L-alanine (dopa) and undergo extensive stabilization by histidyl-dopa cross-link formation. These findings may serve as a foundation for identifying design principles for attaching mechanically mismatched materials in engineering and biological applications."
https://openalex.org/W2156594312,"Learning to associate sensory cues with threats is critical for minimizing aversive experience. The ecological benefit of associative learning relies on accurate perception of predictive cues, but how aversive learning enhances perceptual acuity of sensory signals, particularly in humans, is unclear. We combined multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging with olfactory psychophysics to show that initially indistinguishable odor enantiomers (mirror-image molecules) become discriminable after aversive conditioning, paralleling the spatial divergence of ensemble activity patterns in primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Our findings indicate that aversive learning induces piriform plasticity with corresponding gains in odor enantiomer discrimination, underscoring the capacity of fear conditioning to update perceptual representation of predictive cues, over and above its well-recognized role in the acquisition of conditioned responses. That completely indiscriminable sensations can be transformed into discriminable percepts further accentuates the potency of associative learning to enhance sensory cue perception and support adaptive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2056030683,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22-nucleotide-long noncoding RNAs that normally function by suppressing translation and destabilizing messenger RNAs bearing complementary target sequences. Some miRNAs are expressed in a cell- or tissue-specific manner and may contribute to the establishment and/or maintenance of cellular identity. Recent studies indicate that tissue-specific miRNAs may function at multiple hierarchical levels of gene regulatory networks, from targeting hundreds of effector genes incompatible with the differentiated state to controlling the levels of global regulators of transcription and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. This multilevel regulation may allow individual miRNAs to profoundly affect the gene expression program of differentiated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1984479838,"Stem cells have fascinated both biologists and clinicians for over a century. Here, we discuss the origin of the term ""stem cell,"" which can be traced back to the late 19th century. The term stem cell originated in the context of two major embryological questions of that time: the continuity of the germ-plasm and the origin of the hematopoietic system. Theodor Boveri and Valentin Häcker used the term stem cell to describe cells committed to give rise to the germline. In parallel, Artur Pappenheim, Alexander Maximow, Ernst Neumann, and others used it to describe a proposed progenitor of the blood system. The original meanings of the term stem cell, rather than being historical relics, continue to capture important aspects of the biology of stem cells as we see them today."

https://openalex.org/W2069833326,"Leptin, an adipose-derived hormone, has been implicated in several physiological processes involving the hippocampus. However, the role of leptin in adult hippocampal neurogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that leptin regulates neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult mice as well as in cultured adult hippocampal progenitor cells. Chronic administration of leptin to adult mice increased cell proliferation without significant effects on the differentiation and the survival of newly proliferated cells in the dentate gyrus. The expression of the long form leptin receptor, LepRb, was detected in hippocampal progenitor cells by reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Leptin treatment also increased proliferation of cultured adult hippocampal progenitor cells. Analysis of signal transduction pathways revealed that leptin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and STAT3 but not ERK1/2. Furthermore, pre-treating the cells with specific inhibitors of Akt or STAT3 attenuated leptin-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results support a role for leptin in adult hippocampal neurogenesis and suggest the involvement of the Akt and STAT3 signaling pathways in mediating the actions of leptin on neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034151899,"The trapping of single molecules on surfaces without the formation of strong covalent bonds is a prerequisite for molecular recognition and the exploitation of molecular function. On nanopatterned surfaces, molecules may be selectively trapped and addressed. In a boron nitride nanomesh formed on Rh(111), the pattern consisted of holes 2 nanometers in diameter on a hexagonal superlattice, separated by about 3 nanometers. The trapping was further investigated with density functional theory and the photoemission of adsorbed xenon, where the holes were identified as regions of low work function. The analysis showed that the trapping potential was localized at the rims of the holes."
https://openalex.org/W2075279729,"Using rules extracted from experience to solve problems in novel situations involves cognitions such as analogical reasoning and language learning and is considered a keystone of humans' unique abilities. Nonprimates, it has been argued, lack such rule transfer. We report that Rattus norvegicus can learn simple rules and apply them to new situations. Rats learned that sequences of stimuli consistent with a rule (such as XYX) were different from other sequences (such as XXY or YXX). When novel stimuli were used to construct sequences that did or did not obey the previously learned rule, rats transferred their learning. Therefore, rats, like humans, can transfer structural knowledge from sequential experiences."
https://openalex.org/W2038045995,"The gradual modification of transcription circuits over evolutionary time scales is an important source of the diversity of life. Over the past decade, studies in animals have shown how seemingly small molecular changes in gene regulation can have large effects on morphology and physiology and how selective pressures can act on these changes. More recently, genome-wide studies, particularly those in single-cell yeasts, have uncovered evidence of extensive transcriptional rewiring, indicating that even closely related organisms regulate their genes using markedly different circuitries."
https://openalex.org/W2074378830,"Many properties of chemical reactions are determined by the transition state connecting reactant and product, yet it is difficult to directly obtain any information about these short-lived structures in liquids. We show that two-dimensional infrared (2D-IR) spectroscopy can provide direct information about transition states by tracking the transformation of vibrational modes as a molecule crossed a transition state. We successfully monitored a simple chemical reaction, the fluxional rearrangement of Fe(CO) 5 , in which the exchange of axial and equatorial CO ligands causes an exchange of vibrational energy between the normal modes of the molecule. This energy transfer provides direct evidence regarding the time scale, transition state, and mechanism of the reaction."

We reconstituted type 1 pilus biogenesis from purified pilus proteins. The usher FimD acted as a catalyst to accelerate the ordered assembly of protein subunits independently of cellular energy. Its activity was highly dependent on the adhesin subunit FimH, which triggered the conversion of FimD into a high-efficiency assembly catalyst. Furthermore, a simple kinetic model adequately rationalized usher-catalyzed pilus assembly in vivo. Our results contribute to a mechanistic understanding of protein-catalyzed biogenesis of supramolecular protein complexes at the bacterial outer cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2023410200,"The molecular biology of mammalian magnesium transporters and their interrelations in cellular magnesium homeostasis are largely unknown. Recently, the mouse SLC41A1 protein was suggested to be a candidate magnesium transporter with channel-like properties when overexpressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Here, we demonstrate that human SLC41A1 overexpressed in HEK293 cells forms protein complexes and locates to the plasma membrane without, however, giving rise to any detectable magnesium currents during whole cell patch clamp experiments. Nevertheless, in a strain of Salmonella enterica exhibiting disruption of all three distinct magnesium transport systems (CorA, MgtA, and MgtB), overexpression of human SLC41A1 functionally substitutes these transporters and restores the growth of the mutant bacteria at magnesium concentrations otherwise non-permissive for growth. Thus, we have identified human SLC41A1 as being a bona fide magnesium transporter. Most importantly, overexpressed SLC41A1 provide HEK293 cells with an increased magnesium efflux capacity. With outwardly directed Mg2+ gradients, a SLC41A1-dependent reduction of the free intracellular magnesium concentration accompanied by a significant net decrease of the total cellular magnesium concentration could be observed in such cells. SLC41A1 activity is temperature-sensitive but not sensitive to the only known magnesium channel blocker, cobalt(III) hexaammine.

Intracellular magnesium, especially its ionized fraction (Mg2+), plays a critical role in enzyme activation, making the ion essential for numerous metabolic processes (1Cowan J.A. Biometals. 2002; 15: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Mg2+ is an important co-factor in a number of other physiological functions, including the synthesis of biomacromolecules, secretion of hormones, and modulation of ion channel activity (2Hartwig A.

The eukaryotic proteins SLC41A2 and SLC41A3, together with the protein SLC41A1, form a novel and unique family among the SLC superfamily, which contains 44 families of proteins involved in the transport of various inorganic and organic solutes (Ref. 22Hediger M.A. Romero M.F.

Aasheim H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In humans and mice, the 5-kb long SLC41A1 transcripts have been found in most tissues (notably in heart, muscle, testis, thyroid gland, and kidney) (14Wabakken T. Rian E. Kveine M. Aasheim H.C.

Homologues of the hSLC41A1 have also been identified in worms and insects. A role of SLC41A1 in Mg2+ cellular transport suggests itself because of its partial sequence homology to the bacterial Mg2+ transporter MgtE (14Wabakken T. Rian E. Kveine M. Aasheim H.C. Biochem.

We show that SLC41A1 mediates a slow temperature-sensitive transport of Mg2+ and, importantly, that it is able to substitute genetically distant bacterial Mg2+ transporters CorA, MgtA, and MgtB at a functional level in Salmonella. Overall, our data suggest that SLC41A1 is an Mg2+ carrier playing a significant role in transmembrane Mg2+ transport and, by extrapolation, in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis.

Aasheim, Radium Hospital Oslo, Norway) by using specific primers SLC1-1-6xHis-XbaI, 5′-tgcTCTAGAatgCATCACCATCACCATCACtcctctaagccagag-3′, and SLC2-1-HindIII, 5′-cccAAGCTTctagtccccgacatcc-3′, and cloned into plasmid pUC18. The pUC18-hSLC41A1 and pUC18-(empty) isolated from Escherichia coli were transfected into Salmonella transmitter strain LT2-LB5010 (strR, r-, m+) (25Bullas L.R. Ryu J.I. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 471-474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If not otherwise stated, hSLC41A1 expression was induced by addition of 0.05 mmol liter-1 isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to the growth media. LB medium containing 10 mmol liter-1 MgCl2 was used to culture the MM281 strain. The solid and liquid N-minimal media for complementation tests were prepared according to Nelson and Kennedy (26Nelson D.L. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3042-3049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.5 mmol liter-1 Na2SO4 was used instead of 0.5 mmol liter-1 K2SO4. In addition, the media were supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids (Difco BD) and thiamine (2 mg liter-1, Sigma). Overnight cultures grown in LB medium (37 °C, provided with Mg2+ if necessary) were washed with 0.7% saline, adjusted to an A600 of 0.1 and diluted as indicated in Fig. 4. Serial dilutions were spotted onto N-minimal medium plates containing 10 mmol liter-1, 100 μmol liter-1, or 10 μmol liter-1 MgCl2. Spotted bacteria were cultivated for 36 h. To establish growth curves, overnight cultures grown in LB medium were washed with 0.7% saline, adjusted to an A600 of 0.1, and inoculated into liquid N-minimal media containing 10 mmol liter-1, 100 μmol liter-1, or 10 μmol liter-1 MgCl2. Total proteins were extracted from 250 ml of the bacterial culture (-IPTG or +IPTG, as indicated) using trichloroacetic acid/acetone. Proteins of the membrane fraction were isolated using the ProteoExtract™ Partial Bacterial Proteome Extraction Kit (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). His-tagged hSLC41A1 was immunoprecipitated from the membrane protein fraction with a His6 tag antibody (GenWay Biotech, San Diego, CA). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE utilizing 12.5% polyacrylamide gels, blotted, and labeled with His6 tag antibody and goat anti-mouse (GAM)-HRP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or GAM-κ-HRP (SBA, Birmingham, AL) antibodies. Antibody binding was visualized using the Chemilmager™ 5500 (Alpha Innotech) or AGFA Cronex 5 medical x-ray films developed with the Curix 60 (AGFA). Cultures of strains MM1927, MM281, and MM281-pUC18-hSLC41A1, grown (24 h) in N-minimal medium supplemented with 2 or 10 mmol liter-1 Mg2+, were washed 3 times with 0.7% saline and diluted to a bacterial density of 3 × 108 bacteria ml-1. Diluted bacterial suspensions (1 ml each) were centrifuged. Dried bacterial pellets were resuspended in 0.3 ml of 1 n HNO3 and 0.7 ml of 1-bromododecane (purum-purum, Roth Karlsruhe Germany). Samples were centrifuged and the upper water fractions were used to determine total magnesium content (ICP-MS ELAN 6100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The organic fractions were used to determine protein content. Experimental procedures and data analyses were conducted according to Froschauer et al. (27Froschauer E.M. Kolisek M. Dietrich F. Schweigel M. Schweyen R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2004; 237: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar) except the mag-fura 2 AM loading facilitator Pluronic F-127 was used at a final concentration of 5 μmol liter-1 and the mag-fura 2 AM loading period was 30 min. Measurements were performed with LS-55 spectrofluorometer, operated by FL WinLab software version 4.0 (both products of Perkin-Elmer) at 37 °C, in 3-ml cuvettes containing bacterial suspension (2 ml, 3 × 108 bacteria ml-1). HEK293-(FLAG-SLC41A1)—Full-length hSLC41A1 cDNA was cloned into a modified version of the pCDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal FLAG tag. The FLAG-hSLC41A1 cDNA in pCDNA4/T0 was electroporated into HEK293 cells previously transfected with the pCDNA6/TR construct for Tet-repressor expression. Cells were placed under zeocin selection; zeocin-resistant clones were screened for tet-inducible expression of the FLAG-tagged hSLC41A1 protein. Tet-inducible HEK293-(FLAG-SLC41A1) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 2 mmol liter-1 glutamine (PAN Biotech), PenStrep (PAN Biotech), Normocin™ (0.1 mg ml-1, Cayla Toulouse France), blasticidin (5 μgml-1, Cayla), and zeocin (0.4 mg ml-1, Cayla). FLAG-SLC41A1 overexpression was induced with tetracycline (1 μgml-1, Fluka Germany). HEK293-(HA-TRPM7)—Cultivation conditions were as described in Schmitz et al. (12Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). HEK293—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol liter-1 glutamine, PenStrep, and Normocin. Non-induced (-tet) and induced (+tet, 15-18 h) HEK293-(FLAG-SLC41A1) cells (107 cells ml-1) were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) and protease inhibitors. Membrane protein fraction was isolated from the same cell types with ProteoExtract™ Native Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (M-PEK, Calbiochem). Both, total lysate proteins and membrane fraction proteins had been resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunodecorated with anti-FLAG antibody coupled to HRP (Invitrogen), or with antibody to β-actin (AbCam, Cambridge, UK) conjugated to GAM HRP-linked antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). The same samples were immunoprecipitated by M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma) or isotype control, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membrane was immunoblotted with M2 anti-FLAG (Sigma) and GAM-κ-HRP (SBA, Birmingham, AL). Membranes were developed by enhanced chemical luminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Enriched native membrane proteins were isolated from +tet (15 h) HEK293-(SLC41A1) cells by use of the ProteoExtract™ M-PEK. Native protein samples were mixed with SDS and incubated for 10 min in a thermomixer at 37 °C with moderate shaking before being separated on the BN-polyacrylamide gel gradient (4 > 12%) according to the protocol of Swamy et al. (28Swamy M. Siegers G.M. Minguet S. Wollscheid B. Schamel W.A. Sci. STKE. 2006; 345: l4Google Scholar). Proteins forming complexes with SLC41A1 were resolved by two-dimensional 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Silver Stain Plus (Bio-Rad). The two-dimensional gels running in parallel with those used for silver staining were blotted and immunodecorated with M2 anti-FLAG and GAM HRP-linked antibodies and FLAG-SLC41A1 was visualized by a Chemilmager™ 5500 (Alpha Innotech). Protein marker Native Mark™ was purchased from Invitrogen. 5 × 105 HEK293-(FLAG-SLC41A1) cells were plated on 12-mm glass, gelatin (2%)-coated coverslips and cultured for 24 h. Thereafter, FLAG-hSLC-41A1 overexpression was induced with tetracycline (15 h). Then, labeling of +tet and -tet cells with Alexa Fluor-594 wheat germ agglutinin (2 μg ml-1, 10 min at 4 °C) purchased from Invitrogen was performed. After rinsing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were fixed in 100% methanol (10 min at -20 °C). All following steps were carried out at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS, blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.5% fish skin gelatin (Sigma), and then rinsed with PBS containing 0.02% fish skin gelatin. Subsequently, they were incubated for 45 min each with the primary M2 anti-FLAG antibody (1 mg ml-1) and with the secondary GAM antibody (0.4 mg ml-1, Invitrogen) labeled with Alexa Fluor-488. Processed samples were coated with 5 μl of vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and digital images were acquired using a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 510 META (Zeiss Jena Germany). Colocalization correlation analysis was performed using the Zeiss LSM 510 Image Browser (Zeiss). Whole cell mode patch clamp experiments were performed at 21-25 °C. Data were acquired with Pulse software controlling an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Lambrecht/Pfalz Germany) with settings as described in Schmitz et al. (12Schmitz C. Perraud A.L. Johnson C.O. Inabe K. Smith M.K. Penner R. Kurosaki T. Fleig A. Scharenberg A.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 191-200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Coverslip-grown -tet and +tet HEK293-(SLC41A1) and HEK293-(TRPM7) cells were kept, during all experiments, in a Ringer solution in the following composition (in mmol liter-1): NaCl 140, KCl 2.8, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10, the pH being adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. SLC41A1 intracellular pipette-filling buffer contained (in mmol liter-1): K+-Glu 140, NaCl 8, HEPES 10, the pH being adjusted to 7.2 with NaOH. TRPM7 intracellular pipette-filling buffer contained (in mmol liter-1): Cs+-Glu 140, NaCl 8, HEPES 10, Cs+-BAPTA 10, the pH being adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. In one series of experiments, a low Cl- Ringer solution (in mmol liter-1: sodium glutamate 140, KCl 2.8, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.2) was applied externally and the cells were perfused with KCl-based SLC41A1 intracellular pipette-filling buffer (containing in millimole liter-1: KCl 140 instead of K+-Glu 140). The final osmolarity of each of the above buffers was ∼300 mOsm. The -tet and +tet HEK293-(SLC41A1) cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold, completely divalent-free PBS, detached by use of Hytase (Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany), centrifuged, washed twice in PBS, and finally re-suspended in completely Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks balanced solution (CMF-HBS, pH 7.4, PAN Biotech). Loading of cells with 7.5 μmol liter-1 magfura 2 AM (Molecular Probes) was performed for 25 min at 37 °C in the presence of pluronic acid. After being washed in CMF-HBS, cells were incubated for a further 30 min to allow for complete de-esterification of the fluorescence probe, washed twice in CMF-HBS to remove extracellular mag-fura 2, and stored in CMF-HBS complemented with 10 mmol liter-1 HEPES and 5 mmol liter-1 glucose (CMF-HBS+) until used for measurements of free intracellular [Mg2+] ([Mg2+]i). Measurements were made at 37 °C (or as indicated under “Results”) in 3-ml cuvettes containing cell suspension (2 ml, CMF-HBS+ with a cytocrit of 10%) under stirring after the cells had been washed twice in CMF-HBS+. In experiments with inside-directed Mg2+ gradients, MgCl2 was added to give final concentrations of 2, 5, or 10 mmol liter-1 (30 to 40 s prior to start of the measurements). In control measurements, no Mg2+ was added but, instead, 2, 5, or 10 mmol liter-1 Ca2+ was present in the measuring solution. [Mg2+]i was determined by measuring the fluorescence of the probe-loaded cells in a spectrofluorometer (LS50-B, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by using the fast filter accessory, which allowed fluorescence to be measured at 20-ms intervals with excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and emission at 515 nm. [Mg2+]i values were calculated from the 340/380-nm ratio according to the formula of Grynkiewicz et al. (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using FL WinLab version 4.0 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A dissociation constant of 1.5 mmol liter-1 for the mag-fura 2-Mg2+ complex was used for calculations; minimum (Rmin) and maximum (Rmax) ratios were determined at the end of each experiment by using digitonin. Rmax was found by the addition of 25 mmol liter-1 MgCl2 in the absence of Ca2+, whereas Rmin was obtained by addition of 50 mmol liter-1 EDTA, pH 7.2, to remove all Mg2+ from the solution. For data evaluation, 10-s data sets each were averaged at the beginning of the measurement and then always after 50 s. The final [Mg2+]i was determined as the mean [Mg2+]i of the last 10 s of the measurement. Thus, for the calculation of any given [Mg2+]i, 500 data points were used. If not otherwise stated, data are presented as mean ± S.E. The general procedure was the same as that described for the determination of [Mg2+]i with the following exceptions. Cells were loaded with 10 μmol liter-1 fura 2 AM. The Rmax for fura 2 was obtained in solutions with 2 mm Ca2+ and the Rmin by the addition of 20 mmol liter-1 EGTA, pH 8.0; a dissociation constant of 224 nmol liter-1 was used for the fura 2-Ca2+ complex. The -tet and +tet (15 h) HEK293-(FLAG-SLC41A1) cells were grown to ∼80% confluence, washed twice with serum-free, Mg2+/Ca2+-free HEK293 experimental medium (PAN Biotech), detached by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA buffer, and resuspended in HEK293 medium to give a final cell count of 6 × 106 cells ml-1. The viability of the cells was determined using trypan blue exclusion. Diluted cells were held in the synthetic HEK293 medium for 60 min prior to the addition of Mg2+ to give a final [Mg2+]e of 10 mmol liter-1. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in the presence of Mg2+ at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere for 20 or 180 min. After incubation, they were washed three times with Mg2+/Ca2+-free PBS and dried pellets were mixed with 0.3 ml of 1 n HNO3 and 0.7 ml of 1-bromododecane (purum-purum). Samples were centrifuged and the upper water fractions were used to determine total magnesium contents (flame AM Spectrometer M Series, Thermo Scientific). Protein contents were determined in the organic fractions. All statistical calculations were performed by using Sigma-Stat (Jandel Scientific). Significance was determined by Student's t test; p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. DIDS and cobalt(III) hexaammine (CoHex) were obtained from Sigma. H2DIDS was purchased from Molecular Probes. To assess the basic molecular characteristics of SLC41A1 and its role in cellular Mg2+ transport, we took advantage of the well established tetracycline-controlled expression system in the HEK293 cell line. Several zeocin-resistant clones were tested; clone 17 was selected for this study, because of the high level of overexpression and the lack of molecular leakiness (Fig. 1, B and C). Cell Topography of Recombinant FLAG-hSLC41A1—Computational analyses predicted SLC41A1 to be an integral cell membrane protein with 10 putative transmembrane domains and possibly both N and C termini located intracellularly (Fig. 1A) (14Wabakken T. Rian E. Kveine M. Aasheim H.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 15Goytain A. Quamme G.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 21: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (PSORT II and WOLF PSORT II Prediction). To test whether overexpressed FLAG-hSLC41A1 was targeted to the plasma membrane of the HEK293 cells, we designed several experiments comprising confocal immunolocalization and Western blot analysis of the membrane protein fraction isolated from non-induced (-tet) and tet-induced (+tet) HEK293-(FLAG-hSLC41A1). As shown in Fig. 1B, the recombinant FLAG-tagged SLC41A1 protein was specifically detected in the plasma membrane of +tet (15 h) HEK293-(FLAG-hSLC41A1) cells investigated by confocal microscopy. This was confirmed by colocalization of the green fluorescent signal of immunolabeled hSLC41A1 (M2 anti-FLAG: GAM Alexa 488) with the red fluorescent signal of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to Alexa 594 (Fig. 1B). The latter is known to recognize sialic acid and N-acetylglucosaminyl sugar residues predominantly found on the plasma membrane. Colocalization correlation analysis revealed a 59.3 ± 1.6% overlap of red and green pixels. In contrast, no FLAG-hSLC41A1-specific fluorescence was found in -tet cells (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows data obtained by Western blot analysis of membrane protein fractions and non-membrane protein fractions from -tet and +tet (18 h) cells. The 56-kDa band corresponding to FLAG-hSLC41A1 was predominantly detected in the membrane fraction with lower abundance in the non-membrane fraction. Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated FLAG-hSLC41A1 from membrane and non-membrane protein fraction lysates revealed the same results (Fig. 1C). FLAG-hSLC41A1-specific band was not detected in samples prepared from -tet cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate the plasma membrane localization of FLAG-hSLC41A1 when overexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1A). Complex Forming Ability of hSLC41A1—Various solute transporters have been shown to form stable or transient protein complexes, which are necessary for them to be functional (31Urbanowski J.L. Piper R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38061-38070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 32Chubanov V. Waldegger S. Mederos y Schnitzler M. Vitzthum H. Sassen M.C.

To test whether hSLC41A1 formed such complexes with other proteins, we performed BN-PAGE with native proteins isolated from +tet (15 h) HEK293-(SLC41A1) cells. FLAG-hSLC41A1-containing complexes were immunodetected with M2 anti-FLAG and goat anti-mouse HRP-linked antibodies. We identified two complexes (C1 and C2; Fig. 2A) with molecular masses lying between 720 and 1236 kDa (720 kDa < C1, C2 < 1236 kDa). Next, the hSLC41A1 complexes were gradually degraded by adding SDS in a stepwise manner to give concentrations from 0.05 to 1%. Upon addition of 0.1% SDS, we were able to detect the break-down products of C1 and C2: 480 kDa < C3 < 720 kDa; 242 kDa < C4 < 480 kDa and M ∼56 kDa, the latter corr"

https://openalex.org/W1965667056,"Use of transplantation to create mosaic zebrafish in which only one retinal ganglion cell develops in the eye enables the projection of this axon that innervates the tectum to be observed. It is found that these axons still navigate to their topographically correct target. The experiment rules out competition as essential for topographic specificity in the zebrafish. The retinotectal projection has long been studied experimentally and theoretically, as a model for the formation of topographic brain maps1,2,3. Neighbouring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project their axons to neighbouring positions in the optic tectum, thus re-establishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along this axis requires chemorepellent signalling from tectal cells, expressing ephrin-A ligands, to retinal growth cones, expressing EphA receptors4. High concentrations of ephrin A, increasing from anterior to posterior, prevent temporal axons from invading the posterior tectum. However, the force that drives nasal axons to extend past the anterior tectum and terminate in posterior regions remains to be identified. We tested whether axon–axon interactions, such as competition, are required for posterior tectum innervation. By transplanting blastomeres from a wild-type (WT) zebrafish into a lakritz (lak) mutant, which lacks all RGCs5, we created chimaeras with eyes that contained single RGCs. These solitary RGCs often extended axons into the tectum, where they branched to form a terminal arbor. Here we show that the distal tips of these arbors were positioned at retinotopically appropriate positions, ruling out an essential role for competition in innervation of the ephrin-A-rich posterior tectum. However, solitary arbors were larger and more complex than under normal, crowded conditions, owing to a lack of pruning of proximal branches during refinement of the retinotectal projection. We conclude that dense innervation is not required for targeting of retinal axons within the zebrafish tectum but serves to restrict arbor size and shape."

https://openalex.org/W2165608301,"The synaptic response waveform, which determines signal integration properties in the brain, depends on the spatiotemporal profile of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Here, we show that electrophoretic interactions between AMPA receptor–mediated excitatory currents and negatively charged glutamate molecules accelerate the clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft, speeding up synaptic responses. This phenomenon is reversed upon depolarization and diminished when intracleft electric fields are weakened through a decrease in the AMPA receptor density. In contrast, the kinetics of receptor-mediated currents evoked by direct application of glutamate are voltage-independent, as are synaptic currents mediated by the electrically neutral neurotransmitter GABA. Voltage-dependent temporal tuning of excitatory synaptic responses may thus contribute to signal integration in neural circuits."

https://openalex.org/W2128701198,"Inherited neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington disease and subset of Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, are caused by the mutant genes that have gained undefined properties that harm cells in the nervous system, causing neurodegeneration and clinical phenotypes. Lowering the mutant gene expression is predicted to slow the disease progression and produce clinical benefit. Administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence specific genes. However, long term delivery of siRNA to silence the mutant genes, a requirement for treatment of these chronic central nervous system (CNS) diseases, remains a critical unsolved issue. Here we designed and tested a chemically stabilized siRNA against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) in a mouse model for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We show that the modified siRNA has enhanced stability and retains siRNA activity. Administration of this siRNA at the disease onset by long term infusion into the CNS resulted in widespread distribution of this siRNA, knocked down the mutant SOD1 expression, slowed the disease progression, and extended the survival. These results bring RNA interference therapy one step closer to its clinical application for treatment of chronic, devastating, and fatal CNS disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1986767848,"Activation of cyclic nucleotide-modulated channels such as CNG and HCN channels is promoted by ligand-induced conformational changes in their C-terminal regions. The primary intersubunit interface of these C termini includes two salt bridges per subunit, formed between three residues (one positively charged and two negatively charged amino acids) that we term the SB triad. We previously hypothesized that the SB triad is formed in the closed channel and breaks when the channel opens. Here we tested this hypothesis by dynamically manipulating the SB triad in functioning CNGA1 channels. Reversing the charge at positions Arg-431 and Glu-462, two of the SB triad residues, by either mutation or application of charged reagents increased the favorability of channel opening. To determine how a charge reversal mutation in the SB triad structurally affects the channel, we solved the crystal structure of the HCN2 C-terminal region with the equivalent E462R mutation. The backbone structure of this mutant was very similar to that of wild type, but the SB triad was rearranged such that both salt bridges did not always form simultaneously, suggesting a mechanism for the increased ease of opening of the mutant channels. To prevent movement in the SB triad, we tethered two components of the SB triad region together with cysteine-reactive cross-linkers. Preventing normal movement of the SB triad region with short cross-linkers inhibited channel opening, whereas longer cross-linkers did not. These results support our hypothesis that the SB triad forms in the closed channel and indicate that this region expands as the channel opens."

We present observations of Saturn's south polar vortex (SPV) showing that it shares some properties with terrestrial hurricanes: cyclonic circulation, warm central region (the eye) surrounded by a ring of high clouds (the eye wall), and convective clouds outside the eye. The polar location and the absence of an ocean are major differences. It also shares properties with the polar vortices on Venus, such as polar location, cyclonic circulation, warm center, and long lifetime, but the Venus vortices have cold collars and are not associated with convective clouds. The SPV's combination of properties is unique among vortices in the solar system."
https://openalex.org/W1988848092,"G alpha12 constitutes, along with G alpha13, one of the four families of alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. We found that the N terminus of G alpha12, but not those of other G alpha subunits, contains a predicted mitochondrial targeting sequence. Using confocal microscopy and cell fractionation, we demonstrated that up to 40% of endogenous G alpha12 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells colocalize with mitochondrial markers. N-terminal sequence of G alpha12 fused to GFP efficiently targeted the fusion protein to mitochondria. G alpha12 with mutated mitochondrial targeting sequence was still located in mitochondria, suggesting the existence of additional mechanisms for mitochondrial localization. Lysophosphatidic acid, one of the known stimuli transduced by G alpha12/13, inhibited mitochondrial motility, while depletion of endogenous G alpha12 increased mitochondrial motility. G alpha12Q229L variants uncoupled from RhoGEFs (but not fully functional activated G alpha12Q229L) induced transformation of the mitochondrial network into punctate mitochondria and resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. All examined G alpha12Q229L variants reduced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser-70, while only mutants unable to bind RhoGEFs also decreased cellular levels of Bcl-2. These G alpha12 mutants were also more efficient Hsp90 interactors. These findings are the first demonstration of a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit specifically targeted to mitochondria and involved in the control of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2023453933,"Beta-arrestin 2 is a multifunctional key component of the G protein-coupled receptor complex and is involved in mu-opiate and dopamine D2 receptor signaling, both of which are thought to mediate the rewarding effects of ethanol consumption. We identified elevated expression of the beta-arrestin 2 gene (Arrb2) in the striatum and the hippocampus of ethanol-preferring AA rats compared to their nonpreferring counterpart ANA line. Differential mRNA expression was accompanied by different levels of Arrb2 protein. The elevated expression was associated with a 7-marker haplotype in complete linkage disequilibrium, which segregated fully between the lines, and was unique to the preferring line. Furthermore, a single, distinct, and highly significant quantitative trait locus for Arrb2 expression in hippocampus and striatum was identified at the locus of this gene, providing evidence that genetic variation may affect a cis-regulatory mechanism for expression and regional control of Arrb2. These findings were functionally validated using mice lacking Arrb2, which displayed both reduced voluntary ethanol consumption and ethanol-induced psychomotor stimulation. Our results demonstrate that beta-arrestin 2 modulates acute responses to ethanol and is an important mediator of ethanol reward."
https://openalex.org/W1995767597,"It is widely acknowledged that E2F1 and GSK3β are both involved in the process of cell differentiation. However, the relationship between E2F1 and GSK3β in cell differentiation has yet to be discovered. Here, we provide evidence that in the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by nerve growth factor (NGF), GSK3β was increased at both the mRNA and protein levels, whereas E2F1 at these two levels was decreased. Both wild-type GSK3β and its kinase-defective mutant GSK3β KM can inhibit E2F1 by promoting its ubiquitination through physical interaction. In addition, the colocalization of GSK3β and E2F1 and their subcellular distribution, regulated by NGF, were observed in the process of PC12 differentiation. At the tissue level, GSK3β colocalized and interacted with E2F1 in mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, GSK3β facilitated neurite outgrowth by rescuing the promoter activities of Cdk inhibitors p21 and p15 from the inhibition caused by E2F1. To summarize, our findings suggest that GSK3β can promote the ubiquitination of E2F1 via physical interaction and thus inhibit its transcription activity in a kinase activity independent manner, which plays an important role in the NGF-induced PC12 differentiation.

GSK3β, a multifunctional serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that was originally identified as a regulator of glycogen metabolism, is now known to be a key kinase in several important signaling pathways. The kinase activity of GSK3β is positively regulated by phosphorylation of its Tyr216 and negatively regulated by N-terminal phosphorylation of its Ser9 (1Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). GSK3β is involved in several signaling pathways important for early central nervous system patterning and neuronal differentiation. For example, GSK3β down-regulates β-catenin via phosphorylation through the forming of a multicomponent complex with adenomatous polyposis coli and Axin, and thus inhibits the transcription of downstream genes in Wnt signaling (2Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). In addition, GSK3β regulates cell cycle by phosphorylating cyclin D1 and p21 (3Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 4Rossig L. Badorff C. Holzmann Y. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Biol.

Also, it activates MRP2, an actin-binding protein of the kelch-related protein family, and promotes neurite outgrowth in NGF 3The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RB, retinoblastoma; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. 3The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; RB, retinoblastoma; siRNA, small interfering RNA; WT, wild type; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.-stimulated PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with GSK3β-interfering RNAs results in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth (6Seng S. Avraham H.K. Jiang S. Venkatesh S. Avraham S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8371-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, GSK3β promotes dendrite formation through the ILK-GSK3β pathway in sympathetic neurons (7Naska S. Park K.J. Hannigan G.E. Dedhar S. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 13344-13356Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and it regulates the phosphorylation of CRMP-2, adenomatous polyposis coli, and MAP1B, which are separately related to the polymerization, stabilization, and dynamics of microtubules, principal cytoskeletal components of axons (8Goold R.G. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2005; 28: 524-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The E2F family has at least 10 members, classified as E2Fs (E2F1 to -8) and DPs (DP1 and -2). Physiological E2F exists as E2F/DP heterodimers in mammalian cells, binding and regulating E2F-targeted genes (9Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 10Milton A.H. Khaire N. Ingram L. O'Donnell A.J. La Thangue N.B. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1046-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The E2F family plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression at the G1-S transition mediated by pRB, a retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein. pRB is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). In quiescent cells, pRB binds to E2F heterodimers, leading to transcriptional inactivity and cell cycle arrest. Subsequently, the cell cycle-dependent kinase complexes Cdk4/Cdk6-cyclin D and Cdk2-cyclin E are activated and then phosphorylate pRB. Inactivation of pRB by phosphorylation leads to the dissociation and activation of E2F, which facilitates the activation of E2F-targeted genes, allowing the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression and S phase entry (9Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 11Inoue Y. Kitagawa M. Taya Y. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2083-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although overexpression of E2F1 in tissue culture cells advances quiescent cells into the S phase and therefore stimulates cell proliferation and can be oncogenic, loss of E2F1 in mice results in tumorigenesis, demonstrating that E2F1 also functions as a tumor suppressor (12Field S.J.

Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In addition, the E2F family is crucial in regulating cell differentiation. It has been reported that E2F1 is down-regulated in differentiating PC12 cells and developing quail neural retina (14Persengiev S.P. Kondova I.I. Kilpatrick D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6048-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Espanel X. Le Cam L. North S. Sardet C. Brun G. Gillet G. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas deregulated E2F1 blocks the terminal differentiation by overriding the p15/p16-pRB-E2F checkpoint in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (16Amanullah A. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 475-482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the whole, GSK3β and E2F are important to cell differentiation. However, their relationship in cell differentiation remains to be elucidated. Previous reports have found that GSK3β reduces the level of cyclin D1 by inhibiting its transcription and promoting its degradation and thus depresses the activity of the Cdk-cyclin D1 complex. This would decrease the phosphorylation of pRB and therefore the activation of E2F1 and its targeted genes, including itself (3Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar, 9Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 17Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). These together offered indirect evidence for the regulation of E2F1 by GSK3β. Here we investigated the direct effect of GSK3β on E2F1 and found that in NGF-induced PC12 cells, E2F1 was down-regulated along with the up-regulated GSK3β at both the mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we discovered that GSK3β, independent of its kinase activity, greatly suppressed E2F-luciferase activity by interacting with E2F1 and promoting its instability through a ubquitin-proteasome pathway. Moreover, we observed neural cell-specific cytoplasmic colocalization of E2F1 and GSK3β and further consolidated our results in the mouse hippocampus. In addition, GSK3β could rescue the promoter activity of p15 and p21 inhibited by E2F1. Also, E2F1-suppressed neurite outgrowth was rescued by GSK3β, independent of its kinase activity. Altogether, our findings suggest that the regulation of E2F1 activity by GSK3β plays a role in NGF-induced neural cell differentiation. Reagent and Plasmids—PC12 cells were obtained from Peking Union Medical College (China). NGF was purchased from Xiamen PKU Bioway Ltd. (China). Monoclonal GSK3β antibody (27C10) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. E2F1 antibody (sc-251), GSK3β small interference RNA (siRNA) (sc-35525), E2F1 siRNA (sc-35247), and control nonspecific siRNA (sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). E2F1 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Michael D. Cole (Princeton University). GSK3β (WT/KM), E2F-luciferase, Wnt1, TopFlash-luciferase, LEF-luciferase, p15, and p21 promoters were applied as previously described (18Zhang L. Gao X. Wen J. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8607-8612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19Huang W. Chang H.Y. Fei T. Wu H. Chen Y.G. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged GSK3β deletion mutants were generated by restriction digestions and PCR and subcloned into pCMV-Myc. All of the mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture—HeLa, HEK293T, COS-7, and Hep3B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were cultured in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% Opti-MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). PC12 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. All of these cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For induction of differentiation, cells were cultured overnight on the coated plates, and the medium was replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and NGF at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK293T and PC12 cells were transfected with various plasmids as indicated in the figures. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were measured by a luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Reporter activity was normalized to the control Renilla. Experiments were repeated in triplicate. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting— HEK293T cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). PC12 and N2a cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 40 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the precipitants were washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), and the immune complexes were eluted with sample buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with specific antibody and secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies that were conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells grown on collagen-coated glass coverslips were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 3 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies for an additional 40 min. The nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Frozen sections of mouse brain were cut with a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) at a thickness of 10 μm and immunostained as above. Samples were examined under an Olympus Fluoview 500 microscope. Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Roche Applied Science) reagent, and the genomic DNA was removed by DNase (Takara, Japan). Two micrograms of RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 45 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture using the reverse transcription system (Promega). α-Actin was used as a control. Sequences for the forward primer and reverse primer were as follows: 5′-CCCAAATCAAGGCACATCCT-3′ (GSK3β forward), 5′-TGGAGGCTGATGCAGAAGCG-3′ (GSK3β reverse); 5′-GAAGAAGACCGGTTGTCACC-3′ (E2F1 forward), 5′-GAAATCCAGAGGGGTCAAGTC-3′ (E2F1 reverse); and 5′-GAAGAAGACCGGTTGTCACC-3′ (α-actin forward), 5′-AGTCCGCCTAGAAGCACTTG-3′ (α-actin reverse). The reaction system and procedure were employed as previously described (20Wang Z. Ren L. Zhao X. Hung T. Meng A. Wang J. Chen Y.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7523-7527Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Isolation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Phase—The collected cells were incubated with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 on ice for 5 min. The samples were spun down at 4 °C for 15 min at full speed, and the supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fractions. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer twice and sonicated in the lysis buffer to obtain the nuclear fractions. Western blots were performed on each sample using antibodies against GSK3β and E2F1 and with LaminB and tubulin antibodies as controls for nuclear and cytoplasmic partitions separately. Measurement of Neurite Outgrowth—The effects of GSK3β and E2F1 on neurite outgrowth were analyzed based on the length of the neurite outgrowth. Cells bearing one or more neurites longer than the cell diameter were defined as differentiated cells. At least six randomly selected fields (containing 200 cells/field) were quantified to obtain the histogram. Data are reported as the means ± S.E. Student’s t test was used to assess the significance of three independent experiments. p < 0.05 was used as the criterion of statistical significance. GSK3β Inhibits E2F1 in the Process of Neural Cell Differentiation— Given that E2F1 and GSK3β have both been shown to relate with neural cell differentiation, their expressions were herein evaluated in the differentiation of PC12 cells induced by NGF. PC12 cells were incubated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for various time periods, from 1 to 8 days, and harvested for quantitative real time reverse transcription-PCR assay. Consistent with previous reports, the mRNA level of E2F1 was markedly down-regulated in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, along with the down-regulation of E2F1, the mRNA level of GSK3β was significantly increased (Fig. 1A). Previous reports suggested that GSK3β could be an indirect regulator of E2F1 by influencing the activity of the Cdk-cyclin D complex and the phosphorylation level of RB protein (3Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the phosphorylation level of GSK3β in PC12 cells upon stimulation with NGF (50 ng/ml) with anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, the Ser9 phosphorylation level of GSK3β was rapidly increased by NGF treatment (0.5 h) and began to decline 2 h later. Consistently, GSK3β was markedly increased, and E2F1 was decreased at the protein level. Moreover, we observed a dramatic decrease of E2F1 2 h after NGF stimulation, whereas the kinase activity of GSK3β at this time point was low, as indicated by its high Ser9 phosphorylation. This suggests that the kinase activity of GSK3β may not be the only contributing factor in the inhibition of E2F1 by GSK3β (Fig. 1B). To further substantiate the finding that the inhibition of E2F1 was caused by GSK3β, we overexpressed GSK3β in PC12 cells and analyzed the E2F1 expression level. As shown in Fig. 1C, the E2F1 mRNA level was down-regulated in GSK3β-overexpressed cells. Using siRNA, we also demonstrated that the E2F1 mRNA level was up-regulated when the endogenous GSK3β was knocked down by specific siRNA (Fig. 1C). Consistent results were obtained in the E2F-luciferase reporter assay. Knocking down of GSK3β obviously impaired the reduction of E2F1 by NGF in PC12 cells (Fig. 1D). Similar findings were observed in HEK293T cells that exogenous GSK3β dramatically inhibited E2F-luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas GSK3β siRNA up-regulated it (Fig. 1E). The effects of siRNA against GSK3β or E2F1 were confirmed by Western blotting, as shown in Fig. 1, F and G. Altogether, these results indicate that GSK3β can be a direct negative regulator of E2F1. GSK3β Down-regulates the Transcriptional Activity of E2F1 Independent of Its Kinase Activity—In order to verify whether the inhibition of E2F1 by GSK3β is kinase activity-dependent, we detected the effect of GSK3β wild type and its kinase-defective mutant on the transcriptional activity of E2F1 by a luciferase reporter assay in HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells were ideal for this purpose, because they synthesize E1A and SV40 T antigen, and thus the regulation of E2F1 by the pRB/Cdk pathway can be precluded (21Numa F. Hirabayashi K. Tsunaga N. Kato H. O'Rourke K. Shao H. Stechmann-Lebakken C. Varani J. Rapraeger A. Dixit V.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4676-4680PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the indirect effect of GSK3β on E2F1 through the regulation of cyclin D1 could be excluded. To identify whether the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on E2F1 is dependent on its kinase activity, TDZD-8, an effective pharmacological kinase inhibitor of GSK3β, was also applied. As shown in Fig. 2A, TDZD-8 had no effect on rescuing the inhibition of E2F-luciferase induced by wild-type GSK3β and its kinase-defective mutant GSK3β KM. A similar result was observed in PC12 cells, and the efficiency of TDZD-8 was verified via Wnt-responsive LEF-luciferase reporter (Fig. 2, B and C). Taken together, these results indicate that GSK3β mainly inhibits the transcriptional activity of E2F1 in a kinase activity-independent manner. If GSK3β overexpession were to reduce E2F1 level in HEK293 cells, then the cell proliferation rate should be reduced. The following experiment carried out in HEK293 cells by Cell Counting Kit-8 confirmed that both wild-type GSK3β and GSK3β KM reduce cell proliferation (Fig. 2D). Interaction between E2F1 and GSK3β in Cell Lines—Since the inhibitory effect of GSK3β on E2F-luciferase was kinase activity-independent, GSK3β may regulate E2F1 through direct interaction. To confirm this, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in different cell lines. In PC12 cells, E2F1 was detected in anti-GSK3β immunoprecipitation but not in the control immunoprecipitated with a nonspecific antibody (Fig. 3A). In mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells, GSK3β was detected in anti-E2F1 immunoprecipitation but not in the control (Fig. 3B). The endogenous interaction between E2F1 and GSK3β was also detected in different nonneural cell lines, including HEK293T, HeLa, COS-7, and Hep3B (Fig. 3C). GSK3β KM mutant could also interact with endogenous E2F1 (Fig. 3D). In addition, we found that the association between endogenous E2F1 and GSK3β in PC12 cells was enhanced by NGF treatment, which implies that the interaction between E2F1 and GSK3β is involved in cell differentiation (Fig. 3E). To identify the domain required for E2F1 binding, we constructed GSK3β deletion mutants (supplemental Fig. 1A). As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, B and C, GSK3β N terminus was required for its binding with E2F1. All of these results indicate that GSK3β and E2F1 interact specifically. GSK3β Destabilizes E2F1 by Enhancing the Efficiency of E2F1 Ubiquitination—Next, we tested how this interaction inhibited the transcriptional activity of E2F1. The autoregulated effect of E2F1, which stimulates its own activity directly through the presence of binding sites in the promoters (22Yamasaki L. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 1998; 22: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Kim M.J. Park K.G. Lee K.M. Kim H.S. Kim S.Y. Kim C.S. Lee S.L. Chang Y.C. Park J.Y. Lee K.U. Lee I.K. Hypertension. 2005; 45: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), revealed that the repression of the protein level of E2F1 by GSK3β may also result in the repression of its own mRNA level. GSK3β has been shown to promote the degradation of several proteins via phosphorylation. Therefore, whether GSK3β could affect the E2F1 protein stability via direct interaction was analyzed. PC12 or HEK293T cells transfected with GSK3β or with pCMV vector (negative control) were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, and the protein level of the endogenous E2F1 proteins was examined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, the E2F1 protein level decreased much more rapidly in GSK3β-overexpressed PC12 and HEK293T cells. Overexpression of GSK3β KM also caused rapid decrease of E2F1 protein in these cells (data not shown). These data support our results from the luciferase reporter assay in Fig. 2. Since previous studies demonstrated that E2F1 was degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (24Hofmann F. Martelli F. Livingston D.M. Wang Z. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2949-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 25Hateboer G. Kerkhoven R.M. Shvarts A. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2960-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 26Campanero M.R. Flemington E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2221-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), the ubiquitination of E2F1 was examined in PC12 and HEK293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, ubiquitination of E2F1 was enhanced in PC12 cells overexpressing GSK3β or treated with NGF. In HEK293T, overexpression of both GSK3β and GSK3β KM led to enhanced E2F1 ubiquitination (Fig. 4, D and E). To confirm this, we examined ubiquitination of E2F1 by GSK3β C1 mutant, which cannot associate with E2F1. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1F, GSK3β C1 did not enhance the E2F1 ubiquitination. To summarize, we proved that the overexpression of GSK3β decreased the stability of E2F1 protein by promoting their ubiquitination. NGF Regulates the Subcellular Distribution of GSK3β and E2F1—As important regulators in cell growth and differentiation, both GSK3β and E2F1 can shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (27Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Gill R.M. Hamel P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1187-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To consolidate the association between GSK3β and E2F1, we studied the subcellular localization of GSK3β and E2F1 in both neural and nonneural cell lines via immunofluorescence. Consistent with previous reports, in HEK293T and HeLa cells, E2F1 mainly localized in the nucleus as a transcription factor, whereas GSK3β localized in the cytoplasm (data not shown). However, in PC12 cells, E2F1 colocalized well with GSK3β. Before NGF stimulation, E2F1 predominantly colocalized with GSK3β in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5). After NGF stimulation, GSK3β expression increased markedly in both nucleus and cytoplasm. E2F1 obviously increased in the nucleus, leading to its enhanced nuclear colocalization with GSK3β (Fig. 5). To further confirm these results, we explored the interactions between E2F1 and GSK3β in different cellular compartments by separating the cytoplasm and nucleus in PC12 and HEK293T cells. Consistently, in untreated PC12 cells, E2F1 mainly localized and associated with GSK3β in cytoplasm, and their subsequent association in the nucleus was enhanced by NGF stimulation (Fig. 6A). In HEK293T cells, E2F1 mainly associated with GSK3β in the nucleus (Fig. 6B). We also detected the distribution of E2F1 and GSK3β following NGF time course stimulation and obtained consistent results (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, NGF-induced accumulation of E2F1 in the nucleus was notable, especially when the phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9) was rapidly diminished (Fig. 6C). A quantitative analysis of GSK3β and E2F1 distribution was shown in Fig. 6, D and E. Although total expression of E2F1 decreased, nucleus-localized E2F1 was enhanced with NGF stimulation, which implied that pRB-E2F1 complex formation in the nucleus was increased when GSK3β exhibited the high kinase activity.FIGURE 6Endogenous distribution of E2F1 and GSK3β. A, NGF enhances the association between GSK3β and E2F1 in the nucleus. PC12 cells were treated or untreated with NGF (50 ng/ml) in 100-mm dishes. Three days later, the cytoplasm and nucleus partition of cells were separated for immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-E2F1 antibody or a nonspecific antibody (ns). E2F1-associated GSK3β was revealed by anti-GSK3β immunoblotting (IB) (top). The protein distribution was confirmed by anti-GSK3β or anti-E2F1 immunoblotting with the total cell lysates (middle two panels). Cytoplasmic protein tubulin and nuclear protein LaminB were immunoblotted as control (bottom two panels). B, GSK3β associates with E2F1 both in the cytoplasm and nucleus in nonneural cells at endogenous levels. Cytoplasm and nucleus partition of HEK293T cells were separated for immunoprecipitation with anti-E2F1 antibody or a nonspecific antibody. E2F1-associated GSK3β was revealed by anti-GSK3β immunoblotting (top two panels). The protein distribution was confirmed by anti-GSK3β or anti-E2F1 immunoblotting with the total cell lysates (middle two panels). Cytoplasmic protein tubulin and nuclear protein LaminB were immunoblotted as control (lower two panels). C, NGF induces translocation of E2F1 from cytoplasm to nucleus. PC12 cells were treated with NGF (50 ng/ml) for different times as indicated. Cytoplasm and nucleus partitions of cells were then separated for immunoblotting by anti phospho-GSK3β antibody (top), anti-GSK3β antibody, anti-E2F1 antibody (middle two panels), and anti-tubulin or anti-LaminB antibody (bottom two panels). D, change of GSK3β and E2F1 distribution induced by NGF was quantitatively analyzed. Equal amounts of PC12 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes and treated with or without NGF (50 ng/ml) for 3 days. Three days later, the cytoplasm and nucleus partitions of cells were then separated for immunoblotting by anti-GSK3β antibody and anti-E2F1 antibody (top). The histogram shows a statistical analysis of relative protein expression densities in the cytoplasm and nucleus from three independent experiments. E, statistical analysis of GSK3β and E2F1 distribution stimulated with or without NGF.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E2F1 Colocalizes and Interacts with GSK3β in the Cytoplasm in Mouse Hippocampus—To further confirm the results above, we detected the interaction between GSK3β and E2F1 and examined their localization in the mouse brain. Samples from the hippocampal region of 3-month-old mice were homogenized to perform the immunoprecipitation assay, and obvious interaction between GSK3β and E2F1 was observed (Fig. 7A). The frozen sections of the hippocampus were also immunostained, and the observation supported the colocalization of GSK3β and E2F1 (Fig. 7, B and C). Interestingly, GSK3β and E2F1 displayed a cytosolic colocalization in neurons, which implies in terminally differentiated neurons that the association and staying of GSK3β and E2F1 in the cytoplasm may be important to keep neurons in a quiescent state and to prevent them from proliferation. GSK3β Facilitates Neurite Outgrowth by Rescuing the Cdk Inhibitors p21 and p15 from Suppression Caused by E2F1—Previous studies have reported that loss of E2F1 function resulted in an elevation of Cdk inhibitors, leading to a decrease in Cdk activity and pRB phosphorylation, and a further derepression of pRB-E2F-targeted genes that are required for cell differentiation (29Wu L.

https://openalex.org/W2077151764,"Members of the tristetraprolin family of CCCH tandem zinc finger proteins bind to AU-rich elements in certain cellular mRNAs, leading to their deadenylation and destabilization. Studies in knock-out mice demonstrated roles for three of the family members, tristetraprolin, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2, in inflammation, chorioallantoic fusion, and early embryonic development, respectively. However, little is known about a recently discovered placenta-specific tristetraprolin family member, ZFP36L3. Tristetraprolin, ZFP36L1, and ZFP36L2 have been shown to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, using typical hydrophobic amino acid-rich nuclear export sequences, and nuclear localization sequences located within the tandem zinc finger domain. In contrast, we previously showed that green fluorescent protein-labeled ZFP36L3, expressed in HEK 293 cells, remained cytosolic, even in the presence of the nuclear export blocker leptomycin B. We show here that the conserved tandem zinc finger domain contains an active nuclear localization signal. However, the sequence corresponding to the nuclear export signal in the other family members was nonfunctional, and thus did not contribute to the cytosolic localization. The unique C-terminal repeat domain could override the activity of the nuclear localization sequence, preventing the import of ZFP36L3 into the nucleus. Immunostaining of mouse placenta demonstrated that ZFP36L3 was located only in the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells. Thus, in contrast to the other mammalian members of this protein family, ZFP36L3 is a ""full-time"" cytosolic protein, rather than a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. The significance of this difference in subcellular localization to the physiology of placental trophoblast cells, where ZFP36L3 is selectively expressed, remains to be determined."

The ethical principles that underlie much of their own work are shared with scientists in other countries to a much greater degree than the cultural and religious differences among those countries would lead one to expect.

https://openalex.org/W2019513292,"Spinophilin plays critical roles in regulating trafficking and signaling of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) both in vitro and in vivo (Wang, Q., Zhao, J., Brady, A. E., Feng, J., Allen, P. B., Lefkowitz, R. J., Greengard, P., and Limbird, L. E. (2004) Science 304, 1940-1944). In the present study, we demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of spinophilin modulates the spinophilin-alpha(2A)AR interaction to regulate alpha(2A)AR internalization. Activation of PKA by forskolin abolishes the agonist-enhanced interaction between spinophilin and the alpha(2A)AR, and this event can be blocked by Ser --> Ala mutations at the PKA phosphorylation sites of spinophilin. In addition, a Ser --> Asp mutation that mimics the phosphorylated state at the PKA phosphorylation site Ser-177, which is located within the alpha(2A)AR binding region of spinophilin, is sufficient to block the spinophilin-alpha(2A)AR interaction in intact cells. In cells expressing mutant spinophilin carrying the S177D mutation, agonist-induced internalization of the alpha(2A)AR is accelerated and enhanced, as revealed by both intact cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative immunofluorescent studies. Furthermore, activation of PKA by forskolin enhances agonist-induced internalization of the alpha(2A)AR in cells expressing wild type spinophilin, but not in cells lacking spinophilin or expressing the spinophilin mutant Sp177D. These results strongly support that PKA phosphorylation of spinophilin is functionally relevant in regulating alpha(2A)AR trafficking. Therefore, modulation of spinophilin-receptor interaction through phosphorylation of spinophilin may represent a novel mechanism whereby PKA regulates G protein-coupled receptor trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2072703439,"EcoRII is a homodimer with two domains consisting of a DNA-binding N terminus and a catalytic C terminus and recognizes two specific sequences on DNA. It shows a relatively complicated cleavage reaction in bulk solution. After binding to either recognition site, EcoRII cleaves the other recognition site of the same DNA (cis-binding) strand and/or the recognition site of the other DNA (trans-binding) strand. Although it is difficult to separate these two reactions in bulk solution, we could simply obtain the binding and cleavage kinetics of only the cis-binding by following the frequency (mass) changes of a DNA-immobilized quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) responding to the addition of EcoRII in aqueous solution. We obtained the maximum binding amounts (Deltam(max)), the dissociation constants (K(d)), the binding and dissociation rate constants (k(on) and k(off)), and the catalytic cleavage reaction rate constants (k(cat)) for wild-type EcoRII, the N-terminal-truncated form (EcoRII N-domain), and the mutant derivatives in its C-terminal domain (K263A and R330A). It was determined from the kinetic analyses that the N-domain, which covers the catalytic C-domain in the absence of DNA, preferentially binds to the one DNA recognition site while transforming EcoRII into an active form allosterically, and then the secondary C-domain binds to and cleaves the other recognition site of the DNA strand."
https://openalex.org/W2159497405,"The UK was one of the first countries to introduce legislation regulating embryo research, and the British Parliament has taken a liberal view of the field. However, even in the UK, regulation of human embryonic stem cell (ESC) research has had drawbacks, and the regulatory framework is somewhat inconsistent and imposes considerable bureaucracy. There are around 33 countries that have broadly liberal legislation; each has a different view of what is permissible. Only about eight of these countries have contributed significantly to published research in the field. Paradoxically, in spite of tight federal restrictions, the USA remains the most productive country in terms of the number and quality of peer review research publications. But even in our increasingly global society, complex regulation will become progressively irrelevant and impossible to impose effectively because attitudes will continue to vary widely in different countries and because of international travel and trade. Consequently, there is a universal need for scientists to demonstrate their recognition of the ethical and commercial conflicts that may arise in their research and engage in public debate and dialogue to ensure responsible activity that benefits their research and reflects the values of society."
