https://openalex.org/W2070021921,"The three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types is investigated, revealing that large, megabase-sized chromatin interaction domains are a pervasive and conserved structural feature of genome organization. The spatial organization of the genome is linked to biological function, and advances in genomic technologies are allowing the conformation of chromosomes to be assessed genome wide. Two groups present complementary papers on the subject. Bing Ren and colleagues use Hi-C, an adaption of the chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique, to investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types. Large, megabase-sized chromatin interaction domains, termed topological domains, are found to be a pervasive and conserved feature of genome organization. Edith Heard and colleagues use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) technology and high-resolution microscopy to obtain a high-resolution map of the chromosomal interactions over a large region of the mouse X chromosome, including the X-inactivation centre. A series of discrete topologically associating domains is revealed, as is a previously unknown long intergenic RNA with a potential regulatory role. The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how chromosomes fold within chromosome territories1. These models, however, provide only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular, Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions genome wide2. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin interaction domains, which we term ‘topological domains’, as a pervasive structural feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE) retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing the topological domain structure of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2161212572,"In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a 4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic dissection of the X-inactivation centre."
https://openalex.org/W1964444099,"It is well established that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have a strong genetic component; however, for at least 70% of cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. Under the hypothesis that de novo mutations underlie a substantial fraction of the risk for developing ASD in families with no previous history of ASD or related phenotypes--so-called sporadic or simplex families--we sequenced all coding regions of the genome (the exome) for parent-child trios exhibiting sporadic ASD, including 189 new trios and 20 that were previously reported. Additionally, we also sequenced the exomes of 50 unaffected siblings corresponding to these new (n = 31) and previously reported trios (n = 19), for a total of 677 individual exomes from 209 families. Here we show that de novo point mutations are overwhelmingly paternal in origin (4:1 bias) and positively correlated with paternal age, consistent with the modest increased risk for children of older fathers to develop ASD. Moreover, 39% (49 of 126) of the most severe or disruptive de novo mutations map to a highly interconnected β-catenin/chromatin remodelling protein network ranked significantly for autism candidate genes. In proband exomes, recurrent protein-altering mutations were observed in two genes: CHD8 and NTNG1. Mutation screening of six candidate genes in 1,703 ASD probands identified additional de novo, protein-altering mutations in GRIN2B, LAMC3 and SCN1A. Combined with copy number variant (CNV) data, these results indicate extreme locus heterogeneity but also provide a target for future discovery, diagnostics and therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2131104106,"Rare de novo single nucleotide variants in brain-expressed genes are found to be associated with autism spectrum disorders and to carry large effects. Although it is well accepted that genetics makes a strong contribution to autism spectrum disorder, most of the underlying causes of the condition remain unknown. Three groups present large-scale exome-sequencing studies of individuals with sporadic autism spectrum disorder, including many parent–child trios and unaffected siblings. The overall message from the three papers is that there is extreme locus heterogeneity among autistic individuals, with hundreds of genes involved in the condition, and with no single gene contributing to more than a small fraction of cases. Sanders et al. report the association of the gene SCN2A, previously identified in epilepsy syndromes, with the risk of autism. Neale et al. find strong evidence that CHD8 and KATNAL2 are autism risk factors. O'Roak et al. observe that a large proportion of the mutated proteins have crucial roles in fundamental developmental pathways, including β-catenin and p53 signalling. Multiple studies have confirmed the contribution of rare de novo copy number variations to the risk for autism spectrum disorders1,2,3. But whereas de novo single nucleotide variants have been identified in affected individuals4, their contribution to risk has yet to be clarified. Specifically, the frequency and distribution of these mutations have not been well characterized in matched unaffected controls, and such data are vital to the interpretation of de novo coding mutations observed in probands. Here we show, using whole-exome sequencing of 928 individuals, including 200 phenotypically discordant sibling pairs, that highly disruptive (nonsense and splice-site) de novo mutations in brain-expressed genes are associated with autism spectrum disorders and carry large effects. On the basis of mutation rates in unaffected individuals, we demonstrate that multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants in the same gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles, providing a clear path forward for gene discovery. Among a total of 279 identified de novo coding mutations, there is a single instance in probands, and none in siblings, in which two independent nonsense variants disrupt the same gene, SCN2A (sodium channel, voltage-gated, type II, α subunit), a result that is highly unlikely by chance."
https://openalex.org/W2063382533,"Primary triple-negative breast cancers are shown to vary widely and continuously in the degree of clonal evolution and mutational content at the time of diagnosis, with implications for future studies of the disease. Samuel Aparicio et al. provide an in-depth genomic view of primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), which represent approximately 16% of all breast cancers. TNBC cells are deficient in the expression of receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and epidermal growth factor. Through a combination of transcriptomic data and copy-number variation, this study shows that TNBCs vary widely and continuously in the content of clonal genotypes at the time of diagnosis. This means that future studies will need to consider individual tumour clonal genotypes. Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16% of all breast cancers1. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36% of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time—to our knowledge—in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC2,3 showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2024663595,"Exome sequencing of 175 autism spectrum disorder parent–child trios reveals that few de novo point mutations have a role in autism spectrum disorder and those that do are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant, further supporting extreme genetic heterogeneity of this spectrum disorder. Although it is well accepted that genetics makes a strong contribution to autism spectrum disorder, most of the underlying causes of the condition remain unknown. Three groups present large-scale exome-sequencing studies of individuals with sporadic autism spectrum disorder, including many parent–child trios and unaffected siblings. The overall message from the three papers is that there is extreme locus heterogeneity among autistic individuals, with hundreds of genes involved in the condition, and with no single gene contributing to more than a small fraction of cases. Sanders et al. report the association of the gene SCN2A, previously identified in epilepsy syndromes, with the risk of autism. Neale et al. find strong evidence that CHD8 and KATNAL2 are autism risk factors. O'Roak et al. observe that a large proportion of the mutated proteins have crucial roles in fundamental developmental pathways, including β-catenin and p53 signalling. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are believed to have genetic and environmental origins, yet in only a modest fraction of individuals can specific causes be identified1,2. To identify further genetic risk factors, here we assess the role of de novo mutations in ASD by sequencing the exomes of ASD cases and their parents (n = 175 trios). Fewer than half of the cases (46.3%) carry a missense or nonsense de novo variant, and the overall rate of mutation is only modestly higher than the expected rate. In contrast, the proteins encoded by genes that harboured de novo missense or nonsense mutations showed a higher degree of connectivity among themselves and to previous ASD genes3 as indexed by protein-protein interaction screens. The small increase in the rate of de novo events, when taken together with the protein interaction results, are consistent with an important but limited role for de novo point mutations in ASD, similar to that documented for de novo copy number variants. Genetic models incorporating these data indicate that most of the observed de novo events are unconnected to ASD; those that do confer risk are distributed across many genes and are incompletely penetrant (that is, not necessarily sufficient for disease). Our results support polygenic models in which spontaneous coding mutations in any of a large number of genes increases risk by 5- to 20-fold. Despite the challenge posed by such models, results from de novo events and a large parallel case–control study provide strong evidence in favour of CHD8 and KATNAL2 as genuine autism risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1969605474,"First principles calculations of the thermal and electrical conductivities of liquid iron mixtures under Earth's core conditions suggest a relatively high adiabatic heat flux of 15 to16 terawatts at the core–mantle boundary, indicating that the top of the core must be thermally stratified. The thermal and electrical properties of iron are important for understanding the thermal evolution of the deep Earth and the power available to drive the dynamo that generates Earth's magnetic field. These parameters have previously been estimated by extrapolating results from conditions with lower pressure or temperature, but Monica Pozzo and colleagues now present a calculation from first principles of these parameters at the pressure and temperature of Earth's outer core. Both conductivities are found to be two to three times higher than earlier estimates, prompting a re-evaluation of power estimates for the dynamo. The results greatly restrict models for powering the geodynamo, and indicate that the top of the core must be thermally stratified. The Earth acts as a gigantic heat engine driven by the decay of radiogenic isotopes and slow cooling, which gives rise to plate tectonics, volcanoes and mountain building. Another key product is the geomagnetic field, generated in the liquid iron core by a dynamo running on heat released by cooling and freezing (as the solid inner core grows), and on chemical convection (due to light elements expelled from the liquid on freezing). The power supplied to the geodynamo, measured by the heat flux across the core–mantle boundary (CMB), places constraints on Earth’s evolution1. Estimates of CMB heat flux2,3,4,5 depend on properties of iron mixtures under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions in the core, most critically on the thermal and electrical conductivities. These quantities remain poorly known because of inherent experimental and theoretical difficulties. Here we use density functional theory to compute these conductivities in liquid iron mixtures at core conditions from first principles—unlike previous estimates, which relied on extrapolations. The mixtures of iron, oxygen, sulphur and silicon are taken from earlier work6 and fit the seismologically determined core density and inner-core boundary density jump7,8. We find both conductivities to be two to three times higher than estimates in current use. The changes are so large that core thermal histories and power requirements need to be reassessed. New estimates indicate that the adiabatic heat flux is 15 to 16 terawatts at the CMB, higher than present estimates of CMB heat flux based on mantle convection1; the top of the core must be thermally stratified and any convection in the upper core must be driven by chemical convection against the adverse thermal buoyancy or lateral variations in CMB heat flow. Power for the geodynamo is greatly restricted, and future models of mantle evolution will need to incorporate a high CMB heat flux and explain the recent formation of the inner core."

https://openalex.org/W1972688821,"In the fasted state, increases in circulating glucagon promote hepatic glucose production through induction of the gluconeogenic program. Triggering of the cyclic AMP pathway increases gluconeogenic gene expression via the de-phosphorylation of the CREB co-activator CRTC2 (ref. 1). Glucagon promotes CRTC2 dephosphorylation in part through the protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated inhibition of the CRTC2 kinase SIK2. A number of Ser/Thr phosphatases seem to be capable of dephosphorylating CRTC2 (refs 2, 3), but the mechanisms by which hormonal cues regulate these enzymes remain unclear. Here we show in mice that glucagon stimulates CRTC2 dephosphorylation in hepatocytes by mobilizing intracellular calcium stores and activating the calcium/calmodulin-dependent Ser/Thr-phosphatase calcineurin (also known as PP3CA). Glucagon increased cytosolic calcium concentration through the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP(3)Rs), which associate with CRTC2. After their activation, InsP(3)Rs enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression by promoting the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of CRTC2. During feeding, increases in insulin signalling reduced CRTC2 activity via the AKT-mediated inactivation of InsP(3)Rs. InsP(3)R activity was increased in diabetes, leading to upregulation of the gluconeogenic program. As hepatic downregulation of InsP(3)Rs and calcineurin improved circulating glucose levels in insulin resistance, these results demonstrate how interactions between cAMP and calcium pathways at the level of the InsP(3)R modulate hepatic glucose production under fasting conditions and in diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2030581432,"Decoding post-transcriptional regulatory programs in RNA is a critical step towards the larger goal of developing predictive dynamical models of cellular behaviour. Despite recent efforts, the vast landscape of RNA regulatory elements remains largely uncharacterized. A long-standing obstacle is the contribution of local RNA secondary structure to the definition of interaction partners in a variety of regulatory contexts, including--but not limited to--transcript stability, alternative splicing and localization. There are many documented instances where the presence of a structural regulatory element dictates alternative splicing patterns (for example, human cardiac troponin T) or affects other aspects of RNA biology. Thus, a full characterization of post-transcriptional regulatory programs requires capturing information provided by both local secondary structures and the underlying sequence. Here we present a computational framework based on context-free grammars and mutual information that systematically explores the immense space of small structural elements and reveals motifs that are significantly informative of genome-wide measurements of RNA behaviour. By applying this framework to genome-wide human mRNA stability data, we reveal eight highly significant elements with substantial structural information, for the strongest of which we show a major role in global mRNA regulation. Through biochemistry, mass spectrometry and in vivo binding studies, we identified human HNRPA2B1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, also known as HNRNPA2B1) as the key regulator that binds this element and stabilizes a large number of its target genes. We created a global post-transcriptional regulatory map based on the identity of the discovered linear and structural cis-regulatory elements, their regulatory interactions and their target pathways. This approach could also be used to reveal the structural elements that modulate other aspects of RNA behaviour."

To understand the role of autophagosomes in the HCV life cycle, we established a stable Huh7 hepatoma cell line that contained an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon and also expressed a GFP-LC3 fusion protein. The GFP-LC3 protein is localized to autophagosomes during autophagy and served as a convenient marker for autophagosomes. Our results indicate that the silencing of the expression of LC3 or Atg7, two protein factors critical for the formation of autophagosomes, suppresses the replication of HCV RNA. Confocal microscopy studies revealed the localization of HCV NS5A and NS5B proteins, which are two important components of the HCV RNA replication complex, and nascent HCV RNA to autophagosomes.

This virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family and has a positive-strand RNA genome of ∼9.6 kb. The HCV genome codes for a polyprotein that is ∼3000 amino acids in length. The translation of this polyprotein is mediated by an internal ribosomal entry sequence. This polyprotein is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases to generate 10 mature protein products named core, E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. Among these proteins, core, E1, and E2 are structural proteins; p7, NS2, and NS5A are required for viral assembly and release; and NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B can form a complex to mediate the replication of the HCV genomic RNA (for a review, see Ref. 1.Lemon S.M.

Autophagy plays an important role in the removal of damaged organelles and protein aggregates from cells for recycling and is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It is initiated by the formation of membrane crescents known as isolation membranes or phagophores in the cytoplasm. These isolation membranes will grow into enclosed membrane vesicles known as autophagosomes. Autophagosomes are characterized by their double- and sometimes multiple-membrane structures. They mature by fusing with lysosomes, and their cargos will be digested by lysosomal enzymes. Many protein factors that control autophagy have been identified. For examples, Class III PI3K (PI3KC3) is important for the initiation of autophagy; Atg5, Atg12, and Atg16 are important for the formation of isolation membranes; and Atg3, Atg4, and Atg7 are important for the conjugation of LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine for the formation of autophagosomes. LC3 is a cytosolic protein. However, it is localized to the autophagosomal membranes after its lipidation (for a review, see Ref. 10.Levine B. Kroemer G.

However, there are controversies regarding how the autophagic pathway may assist HCV replication, as some studies suggested that it enhanced HCV RNA replication, whereas others suggested that it might affect the release of HCV particles or the translation of the HCV RNA (3.Sir D.

Autophagy protein ATG5 interacts transiently with the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase (NS5B) early during infection.Virology. 2010; 405: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These controversies may be caused by a variety of reasons, including the use of different experimental systems such as transfection using the HCV genomic RNA or infection using the HCV particles, and the selection of different autophagic cellular factors for the RNAi knockdown experiments. Our previous studies indicated that the knockdown of LC3 or Atg7, which suppresses the formation of autophagosomes, significantly reduces the HCV RNA level in cells productively replicating HCV (3.Sir D. Chen W.L. Choi J. Wakita T. Yen T.S. Ou J.H. Induction of incomplete autophagic response by hepatitis C virus via the unfolded protein response.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role of autophagosomes in HCV RNA replication. These results were supported by a recent report that demonstrated that HCV NS3 and NS5A proteins co-fractionated with the lipidated LC3 protein on a sucrose gradient and that the double-stranded HCV RNA (i.e. the HCV replicative intermediate RNA) was detected on autophagosome-like membrane vesicles (8.Ferraris P. Blanchard E. Roingeard P. Ultrastructural and biochemical analyses of hepatitis C virus-associated host cell membranes.J. Gen. Virol. 2010; 91: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in this recent report, it was unclear whether the co-fractionation of NS3 and NS5A with lipidated LC3 on the gradient was incidental and whether those autophagosome-like vesicles were indeed autophagosomes. Thus, in an attempt to further understand the relationship between autophagosomes and HCV RNA replication, we produced an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon cell line that is devoid of HCV structural proteins for our studies. Our results demonstrate that HCV RNA replication takes place primarily on autophagosomal membranes in these replicon cells. Huh7 is a human hepatoma cell line, and Huh7.5 is a subline of Huh7. These cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For nutrient starvation, cells were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 30 min prior to lysis for Western blot analysis. HuhHyg replicon cells are Huh7 cells that contain the subgenomic RNA replicon of the HCV-N strain, which belongs to genotype 1b (18.Guo J.T. Bichko V.V. Seeger C. Effect of α-interferon on the hepatitis C virus replicon.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8516-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The production of this cell line has been described previously (19.Liu H.M. Aizaki H. Choi K.S. Machida K. Ou J.J. Lai M.M. SYNCRIP (synaptotagmin-binding, cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein) is a host factor involved in hepatitis C virus RNA replication.Virology. 2009; 386: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This cell line was maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. To generate the GFP-LC3 replicon (GLR) cells, HuhHyg replicon cells were transfected with plasmid pEGFP-LC3, which expresses the GFP-LC3 fusion protein, followed by selection with 0.7 μg/ml G418 and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B. Sg-PC2 is another Huh7 cell line that contains the HCV Con1 subgenomic RNA replicon. This cell line has also been described previously (20.Choi J. Lee K.J. Zheng Y. Yamaga A.K. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Reactive oxygen species suppress hepatitis C virus RNA replication in human hepatoma cells.Hepatology. 2004; 39: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Atg7, LC3(1), LC3(2), Beclin-1, human Vps34 (hVps34), and negative control siRNAs were purchased from Qiagen. LC3(3) siRNA, which was described previously (21.Zhu J.H. Horbinski C. Guo F. Watkins S. Uchiyama Y. Chu C.T. Regulation of autophagy by extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases during 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced cell death.Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), was synthesized at the Genomics Core of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The siRNA knockdown was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells fixed with 4% formaldehyde were incubated with mouse anti-NS5A antibody 9E10 (a gift from Dr. Charles Rice, Rockefeller University), rabbit anti-NS5B antibody (a gift from Dr. Soon Hwang, Hallym University, Gangwon-do, South Korea), mouse anti-Rab7 antibody (Sigma), or mouse anti-bromouridine antibody (Sigma), followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 405-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody for confocal microscopy. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Cells pretreated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1 h at 37 °C were washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 4.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, and 150 mm sucrose) and incubated with buffer A containing 100 μg/ml lysolecithin for 90 s on ice. Cells were then treated for 40 min with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 6 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm KCl, 44 mm NaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 1 mm ATP, 200 μm GTP, 200 μm CTP, 500 μm BrUTP, 10 μm dTTP, 12 μm creatine phosphate, 200 μm spermidine, 10 μg/ml actinomycin D, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 1 mm DTT) at 37 °C for the labeling of nascent HCV RNA. Cells scraped in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7) and 0.25 mm sucrose were lysed using a 27.5-gauge syringe needle, followed by a brief centrifugation in a microcentrifuge for the removal of nuclear debris. The supernatant was incubated with the mouse anti-GFP antibody or control mouse IgG, followed by incubation with BioMag goat anti-mouse IgG beads. The protein-antibody complex was separated with a magnetic separator and subjected to analysis by in vitro RNA replication as described below and by Western blotting for the presence of HCV proteins, GFP-LC3, and Rab7. Autophagosomes affinity-purified as described above were resuspended in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm UTP, 10 μm CTP, 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, and 30 μCi of [α-32P]CTP and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C. The HCV RNA synthesized was then isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in neutral phosphate buffer, post-fixed in osmium tetraoxide, and embedded in Epon. Sections were cut at 80 nm and examined under a Philips Tecnai 10 electron microscope. For EM-gold, cells were incubated with mouse anti-bromouridine and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies, followed by incubation with 30-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-mouse and 15-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. We have previously demonstrated that the suppression of LC3 and Atg7 expression reduces the HCV RNA level in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells transfected with the HCV JFH1 genomic RNA (3.Sir D. Chen W.L. Choi J. Wakita T. Yen T.S. Ou J.H. Induction of incomplete autophagic response by hepatitis C virus via the unfolded protein response.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), indicating a possible role of autophagosomes in HCV RNA replication. Because we had previously also demonstrated that the HCV subgenomic RNA replicon induces autophagosomes, we decided to use the HCV subgenomic RNA replicon to further examine the relationship between autophagosomes and HCV RNA replication. HuhHyg cells, which carry the bicistronic subgenomic RNA replicon of the HCV-N strain (Fig. 1A), were transfected with plasmid pEGFP-LC3 to produce a stable HCV replicon cell line that expresses the GFP-LC3 fusion protein. The GFP-LC3 fusion protein is a cytosolic protein, but it is lipidated and associated with autophagosomal membranes during autophagy (3.Sir D. Chen W.L. Choi J. Wakita T. Yen T.S. Ou J.H. Induction of incomplete autophagic response by hepatitis C virus via the unfolded protein response.Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1054-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). This GFP-LC3-expressing stable HCV replicon cell line, which we named the GLR cell line, contained the replicating HCV RNA, as demonstrated by its stable expression of the HCV NS5A protein (Fig. 1B) and by the ability of the cell lysates to direct HCV RNA replication in vitro (see below). In agreement with the previous report, this stable cell line also had elevated levels of autophagosomes, as evidenced by the detection of lipidated GFP-LC3, an increased level of lipidated LC3 (Fig. 1B), and an increased number of GFP-LC3 autophagosomal puncta (see below). This GLR cell line was therefore used in our subsequent studies. To determine whether autophagosomes are indeed required for HCV RNA replication, we performed the siRNA knockdown experiment to suppress the expression of LC3, a protein critical for the formation of autophagosomes. To rule out the possibility of off-target effects, we used three different LC3 siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2A, the siRNAs directed against LC3 efficiently reduced its expression level. These siRNAs also reduced the number of autophagosomal puncta in GLR cells (Fig. 2B), confirming the role of LC3 in the formation of autophagosomes. In agreement with our previous studies using the full-length HCV JFH1 genomic RNA, the suppression of LC3 expression led to the reduction of the HCV RNA level in replicon cells (Fig. 2C). In addition to LC3, we also performed an Atg7 knockdown experiment using its specific siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, the silencing of Atg7 expression greatly inhibited the lipidation of endogenous LC3 and GFP-LC3. This result is consistent with the biological activity of Atg7, which is to mediate the lipidation of LC3. Similarly, the suppression of Atg7 expression also reduced the number of autophagosomal puncta and the HCV RNA level in GLR replicon cells (Fig. 2, B and C). The reduction of the HCV RNA level after the inhibition of autophagy was not due to the reduction of cell viability (supplemental Fig. 1), nor was it due to the induction of the interferon response, as analysis of the 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, an interferon-stimulated gene, revealed no induction of expression of this gene after the silencing of Atg7 expression (supplemental Fig. 2). Previous studies have generated discordant results regarding the possible role of autophagy in HCV RNA replication (3.Sir D. Chen W.L. Choi J. Wakita T. Yen T.S. Ou J.H.

Autophagy protein ATG5 interacts transiently with the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase (NS5B) early during infection.Virology. 2010; 405: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). As some of these past studies targeted PI3KC3 for its effect on HCV RNA replication, we decided to investigate the possible role of this particular factor in the lipidation of LC3 induced by HCV. PI3KC3 phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and is important for the initiation of autophagy induced by nutrient starvation (10.Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), which is an inhibitor of PI3KC3, indeed suppressed the lipidation of LC3 induced by nutrient starvation. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 3B, 3-MA did not abolish the lipidation of LC3 induced by HCV, indicating that HCV likely induced the autophagic response in a PI3KC3-independent manner. To confirm this possibility, we performed the siRNA knockdown experiment to suppress the expression of hVps34, the catalytic subunit of PI3KC3, and Beclin-1, a protein factor that activates the PI3KC3 complex (22.Funderburk S.F. Wang Q.J. Yue Z. The Beclin-1-VPS34 complex: at the crossroads of autophagy and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). As a positive control, we tested the effects of hVps34 and Beclin-1 siRNAs on autophagy induced by nutrient starvation. As shown in Fig. 4A, these two siRNAs efficiently suppressed the expression of their respective target proteins in Huh7.5 cells with or without nutrient starvation. As expected, these two siRNAs also suppressed the lipidation of LC3 in cells that were nutrient-starved (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the suppression of expression of hVps34 with its specific siRNA had no significant effect on the lipidation of LC3 induced by HCV (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the inhibition of Beclin-1 expression also had no effect on the lipidation of LC3 in GLR replicon cells (Fig. 4D). These results together provide a strong argument that HCV induces autophagosomes in a PI3KC3-independent manner.FIGURE 4Effects of PI3KC3 and Beclin-1 on LC3 lipidation induced by HCV. A, Western blot analysis of Huh7 cells treated with the negative control siRNA (Cont.) or the siRNA directed against hVps34 or Beclin-1.

As shown in Fig. 5A, a small fraction of the HCV NS5A protein was found to colocalize with autophagosomes, which were revealed by the punctate GFP-LC3 signals. When NS5A and NS5B were analyzed together by confocal microscopy, a small fraction of these two proteins were again found to colocalize on autophagosomes (Fig. 5B), suggesting the possible formation of the HCV RNA replication complex on autophagosomal membranes. To determine whether HCV RNA replication is indeed associated with autophagosomes, we treated HCV replicon cells with actinomycin D to suppress cellular RNA synthesis and labeled nascent HCV RNA with BrUTP. As shown in Fig. 6A, essentially all of the HCV RNA signals labeled by BrUTP were associated with autophagosomes. This labeling was specific to HCV RNA, as treatment of GLR cells with 2′-C-methyladenosine, an inhibitor of HCV NS5B RNA polymerase, resulted in the loss of BrUTP signals and the GFP-LC3 puncta (supplemental Fig. 3). To further confirm this result, we conducted another confocal microscopy experiment using the Sg-PC2 cell line, which contains the HCV Con1 subgenomic RNA replicon without the stable expression of GFP-LC3 (20.Choi J. Lee K.J. Zheng Y. Yamaga A.K. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Reactive oxygen species suppress hepatitis C virus RNA replication in human hepatoma cells.Hepatology. 2004; 39: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this particular experiment, the anti-LC3 antibody was used to detect endogenous LC3. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 6B, BrUTP-labeled nascent HCV RNA colocalized with punctate LC3 signals. These results provide further support that the replication of HCV RNA takes place on autophagosomes. To investigate whether HCV RNA replication can also take place on autophagosomes in HCV-infected cells, we infected stable GFP-LC3 cells with the HCV JFH1 virus and conducted a similar labeling experiment. As shown in supplemental Fig. 5, nascent HCV RNA was also found to partially colocalized with autophagosomal puncta in HCV-infected cells. To confirm that the HCV RNA replication complex is indeed associated with autophagosomes, GLR cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer, and autophagosomes were immunoprecipitated by anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 7A, the anti-GFP antibody, but not the control antibody, was able to precipitate the GFP-LC3 fusion protein and its lipidated form. This anti-GFP antibody could also precipitate Rab7, a small GTPase that is important for the maturation of autophagosomes (23.Jäger S. Bucci C. Tanida I. Ueno T. Kominami E. Saftig P. Eskelinen E.L. Role for Rab7 in maturation of late autophagic vacuoles.J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4837-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and for HCV RNA replication (24.Manna D. Aligo J. Xu C. Park W.S. Koc H. Heo W.D. Konan K.V. Endocytic Rab proteins are required for hepatitis C virus replication complex formation.Virology. 2010; 398: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, this antibody could not precipitate the nonspecific β-actin protein (Fig. 7A). In addition, in support of the confocal microscopy results shown in Fig. 5, which indicated that HCV NS5A and NS5B were associated with autophagosomes, both NS5A and NS5B were also co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-GFP antibody. Similarly, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 6, autophagosomal membranes precipitated by the anti-GFP antibody were able to direct the synthesis of HCV RNA in vitro. To ensure the specificity of these results, we conducted the same experiment with Sg-PC2 cells, which contain the HCV subgenomic RNA replicon without the GFP-LC3 protein. As shown in supplemental Fig. 5, in the absence of GFP-LC3, the anti-GFP antibody was not able to precipitate autophagosomes, as evidenced by the lack of LC3 signals in the Western blot analysis. This antibody was also not able to precipitate the HCV RNA replication complex. Taken together, these results strongly indicate the association of the HCV RNA replication complex with autophagosomes. To further understand the relationship between the HCV RNA replication complex and autophagosomes, we performed double-labeling immunoelectron microscopy analysis. In this study, HCV replicon cells were permeabilized with lysolecithin, and nascent HCV RNA was labeled with BrUTP. The localization of nascent HCV RNA in cells was then analyzed using the mouse anti-bromouridine primary antibody and the secondary antibody conjugated with 30-nm gold particles. The localization of GFP-LC3 was analyzed using the rabbit anti-GFP primary antibody and the secondary antibody conjugated with 15-nm gold particles. These gold particle-conjugated secondary antibodies are specific and allow the identification of the locations of nascent HCV RNA and GFP-LC3. As shown in Fig. 8A, multiple autophagosome-like vesicles ranging from 300 to 700 nm in diameter were detected. These membrane vesicles were positive for GFP-LC3, as evidenced by the association of 15-nm gold particles (see the boxed area in Fig. 8A), and for nascent HCV RNA, as evidenced by the association of 30-nm gold particles. These results demonstrate that the synthesis of nascent HCV RNA takes place on autophagosomal membranes. Previous studies indicated that HCV perturbs the autophagic pathway to induce the accumulation of autophagosomes. In this study, we have demonstrated that suppression of the expression of LC3 and Atg7, two protein factors critical for the formation of autophagosomes, reduces the HCV RNA replication level (Fig. 2). We further demonstrated the colocalization of HCV NS5A, HCV NS5B and nascent HCV RNA with autophagosomes (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6) and showed that the HCV RNA replication complex can be co-immunoprecipitated with autophagosomes (Fig. 7). The association of nascent HCV RNA with autophagosomes was also observed in HCV-infected cells (supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, by conducting immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated the localization of the HCV RNA replication complex on autophagosomal membranes (Fig. 8). Taken together, our results strongly indicate that the replication of HCV RNA takes place on autophagosomal membranes. It remains to be determined, however, how the HCV RNA replication complex is assembled on autophagosomal membranes and whether the lipidated LC3 or other cellular proteins associated with autophagosomes directly participate in the replication of HCV RNA. It has been reported that the HCV RNA replication complex is associated with membranous webs (25.Gosert R. Egger D. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. Blum H.E. Bienz K. Moradpour D. Identification of the hepatitis C virus RNA replication complex in Huh7 cells harboring subgenomic replicons.J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 26.Egger D.

Virol. 2002; 76: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), which are clusters of tightly associated membrane vesicles with varying sizes. The relationship between these membranous webs and autophagosomes is unclear at this moment. It is possible that membranous webs may be the result of clustering and coalescing of autophagosomes. The possibility that these membranous webs serve as the germinating center for the production of autophagosomes also cannot be ruled out. Although independent reports indicated that HCV could can autophagosomes (2.Ait-Goughoulte M. Kanda T. Meyer K. Ryerse J.S. Ray R.B. Ray R.

Our previous results demonstrated that the suppression of LC3 or Atg7 expression with RNAi inhibits replication of the HCV JFH1 genomic RNA in Huh7.5 cells. Mizui et al. (7.Mizui T. Yamashina S. Tanida I. Takei Y. Ueno T. Sakamoto N. Ikejima K. Kitamura T. Enomoto N. Sakai T. Kominami E. Watanabe S.

Gastroenterol. 2010; 45: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) also reported that chemical compounds that suppress autophagy or the silencing of Atg5, Atg7, or LC3 expression can inhibit the replication of the HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. In contrast, Dreux et al. (5.Dreux M. Gastaminza P. Wieland S.F. Chisari F.V. The autophagy machinery is required to initiate hepatitis C virus replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14046-14051Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) reported that the silencing of Beclin-1 suppresses the infection of Huh7 cells with HCV, but this silencing has no effect on HCV in cells containing the stable HCV subgenomic RNA replicon or in cells previously infected with HCV. Dreux et al. provided further results to suggest that the effect of autophagy on HCV is on the translation of incoming HCV RNA. Some of the controversies can be resolved by the fact that different cellular factors were targeted for silencing. As shown in FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, we found that HCV induced the autophagic response independently of PI3KC3, an enzyme that is critical for autophagy induced by nutrient starvation (27.Tassa A.

The Beclin-1-VPS34 complex: at the crossroads of autophagy and beyond.Trends Cell Biol. 2010; 20: 355-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), its silencing would not be expected to affect the autophagosomes induced by HCV. Indeed, as we showed in Fig. 4D, the suppression of Beclin-1 expression did not affect the lipidation of LC3. Because the silencing of expression of autophagic protein factors prior to HCV infection often has a more pronounced effect on HCV RNA replication than when the silencing is conducted after the HCV infection has been established (5.Dreux M. Gastaminza P. Wieland S.F. Chisari F.V. The autophagy machinery is required to initiate hepatitis C virus replication.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Autophagy protein ATG5 interacts transiently with the hepatitis C virus RNA polymerase (NS5B) early during infection.Virology. 2010; 405: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is also possible that autophagosomes may serve as the site for HCV RNA replication in the early stage of HCV infection, and further alterations of cellular membranes by HCV, such as the induction of membranous webs, in the later stage of infection result in the generation of membranes for HCV RNA replication in an autophagy-independent manner. In this regard, it is interesting to note that some of the nascent HCV RNA in HCV-infected cells was not found to be associated with autophagosomes (supplemental Fig. 4). How HCV induces autophagosomes in a PI3KC3-independent manner remains unclear. It is likely that it may involve the alteration of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes, as we and another group had reported that HCV induces autophagosomes through the unfolded protein response (3.Sir D.

Our finding that the HCV RNA replicates on autophagosomal membranes puts HCV on the list with other positive-strand RNA viruses, including poliovirus, coxsackieviruses, dengue viruses, and possibly also rhinoviruses and nidoviruses, which use the membranes of autophagic vacuoles for their RNA replication (for a review, see Ref. 16.Sir D.

https://openalex.org/W2038720191,"Background Recently, several studies have demonstrated that two long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), HULC and MALAT1, may participate in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and progression. However, genetic variations in the two lncRNAs and their associations with HCC susceptibility have not been reported. In this study, we hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HULC and MALAT1 may contribute to HCC risk. Methods We conducted a case-control study and genotyped two SNPs, rs7763881 in HULC and rs619586 in MALAT1, in 1300 HBV positive HCC patients, 1344 HBV persistent carriers and 1344 subjects with HBV natural clearance to test the associations between the two SNPs and susceptibility to HCC and HBV chronic infection. Results The variant genotypes of rs7763881 were significantly associated with decreased HCC risk in a dominant genetic model [AC/CC vs. AA: adjusted odds ration (OR) = 0.81, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.68–0.97, P = 0.022]. Furthermore, the variant genotypes of rs619586 was associated with decreased HCC risk with a borderline significance (AG/GG vs. AA: adjusted OR = 0.81, 95% CIs = 0.65–1.01, P = 0.057). However, no significant association was found between the two SNPs and HBV clearance. Conclusions The variant genotypes of rs7763881 in HULC may contribute to decreased susceptibility to HCC in HBV persistent carriers."

https://openalex.org/W1985266650,"Centromeres are chromosomal loci that direct segregation of the genome during cell division. The histone H3 variant CENP-A (also known as CenH3) defines centromeres in monocentric organisms, which confine centromere activity to a discrete chromosomal region, and holocentric organisms, which distribute centromere activity along the chromosome length. Because the highly repetitive DNA found at most centromeres is neither necessary nor sufficient for centromere function, stable inheritance of CENP-A nucleosomal chromatin is postulated to propagate centromere identity epigenetically. Here, we show that in the holocentric nematode Caenorhabditis elegans pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes are not necessary to guide recruitment of new CENP-A nucleosomes. This is indicated by lack of CENP-A transmission by sperm during fertilization and by removal and subsequent reloading of CENP-A during oogenic meiotic prophase. Genome-wide mapping of CENP-A location in embryos and quantification of CENP-A molecules in nuclei revealed that CENP-A is incorporated at low density in domains that cumulatively encompass half the genome. Embryonic CENP-A domains are established in a pattern inverse to regions that are transcribed in the germline and early embryo, and ectopic transcription of genes in a mutant germline altered the pattern of CENP-A incorporation in embryos. Furthermore, regions transcribed in the germline but not embryos fail to incorporate CENP-A throughout embryogenesis. We propose that germline transcription defines genomic regions that exclude CENP-A incorporation in progeny, and that zygotic transcription during early embryogenesis remodels and reinforces this basal pattern. These findings link centromere identity to transcription and shed light on the evolutionary plasticity of centromeres."
https://openalex.org/W2025869035,"Abnormal folding of tau protein leads to the generation of paired helical filaments (PHFs) and neurofibrillary tangles, a key neuropathological feature in Alzheimer disease and tauopathies. A specific anatomical pattern of pathological changes developing in the brain suggests that once tau pathology is initiated it propagates between neighboring neuronal cells, possibly spreading along the axonal network. We studied whether PHFs released from degenerating neurons could be taken up by surrounding cells and promote spreading of tau pathology. Neuronal and non-neuronal cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein-tagged tau (GFP-Tau) were treated with isolated fractions of human Alzheimer disease-derived PHFs for 24 h. We found that cells internalized PHFs through an endocytic mechanism and developed intracellular GFP-Tau aggregates with attributes of aggresomes. This was particularly evident by the perinuclear localization of aggregates and redistribution of the vimentin intermediate filament network and retrograde motor protein dynein. Furthermore, the content of Sarkosyl-insoluble tau, a measure of abnormal tau aggregation, increased 3-fold in PHF-treated cells. An exosome-related mechanism did not appear to be involved in the release of GFP-Tau from untreated cells. The evidence that cells can internalize PHFs, leading to formation of aggresome-like bodies, opens new therapeutic avenues to prevent propagation and spreading of tau pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2036481536,"Adult stem cells sustain tissue maintenance and regeneration throughout the lifetime of an animal. These cells often reside in specific signalling niches that orchestrate the stem cell's balancing act between quiescence and cell-cycle re-entry based on the demand for tissue regeneration. How stem cells maintain their capacity to replenish themselves after tissue regeneration is poorly understood. Here we use RNA-interference-based loss-of-function screening as a powerful approach to uncover transcriptional regulators that govern the self-renewal capacity and regenerative potential of stem cells. Hair follicle stem cells provide an ideal model. These cells have been purified and characterized from their native niche in vivo and, in contrast to their rapidly dividing progeny, they can be maintained and passaged long-term in vitro. Focusing on the nuclear proteins and/or transcription factors that are enriched in stem cells compared with their progeny, we screened ∼2,000 short hairpin RNAs for their effect on long-term, but not short-term, stem cell self-renewal in vitro. To address the physiological relevance of our findings, we selected one candidate that was uncovered in the screen: TBX1. This transcription factor is expressed in many tissues but has not been studied in the context of stem cell biology. By conditionally ablating Tbx1 in vivo, we showed that during homeostasis, tissue regeneration occurs normally but is markedly delayed. We then devised an in vivo assay for stem cell replenishment and found that when challenged with repetitive rounds of regeneration, the Tbx1-deficient stem cell niche becomes progressively depleted. Addressing the mechanism of TBX1 action, we discovered that TBX1 acts as an intrinsic rheostat of BMP signalling: it is a gatekeeper that governs the transition between stem cell quiescence and proliferation in hair follicles. Our results validate the RNA interference screen and underscore its power in unearthing new molecules that govern stem cell self-renewal and tissue-regenerative potential."

The mechanisms by which CBMs recognize specific surfaces of cellulose and aid in deconstruction are essential to understand cellulase action.

It is most commonly suggested that three aromatic residues identify the planar binding face of this CBM, but several recent studies have challenged this hypothesis. Here, we use molecular simulation to study the CBM binding orientation and affinity on hydrophilic and hydrophobic cellulose surfaces. Roughly 43 μs of molecular dynamics simulations were conducted, which enables statistically significant observations. We quantify the fractions of the CBMs that detach from crystal surfaces or diffuse to other surfaces, the diffusivity along the hydrophobic surface, and the overall orientation of the CBM on both hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces. The simulations demonstrate that there is a thermodynamic driving force for the Cel7A CBM to bind preferentially to the hydrophobic surface of cellulose relative to hydrophilic surfaces. In addition, the simulations demonstrate that the CBM can diffuse from hydrophilic surfaces to the hydrophobic surface, whereas the reverse transition is not observed. Lastly, our simulations suggest that the flat faces of Family 1 CBMs are the preferred binding surfaces.

https://openalex.org/W2008852611,"In species in which juvenile survival depends strongly on male tenure, excessive trophy hunting can artificially elevate male turnover and increase infanticide, potentially to unsustainable levels. Simulation models show that the likelihood of safe harvests can be improved by restricting offtakes to males old enough to have reared their first cohort of offspring to independence; in the case of African leopards, males were ≥7 years old. Here, we explore the applicability of an age-based approach for regulating trophy hunting of leopards. We conducted a structured survey comprising photographs of known-age leopards to assess the ability of wildlife practitioners to sex and age leopards. We also evaluated the utility of four phenotypic traits for use by trophy hunters to age male leopards in the field. Our logistic regression models showed that male leopard age affected the likelihood of survey respondents identifying the correct sex; notably, males <2 years were typically misidentified as females, while mature males (≥4 years) were sexed correctly. Mature male leopards were also more likely to be aged correctly, as were portrait photographs. Aging proficiency was also influenced by the profession of respondents, with hunters recording the lowest scores. A discriminant model including dewlap size, the condition of the ears, and the extent of facial scarring accurately discriminated among male leopard age classes. Model classification rates were considerably higher than the respective scores attained by survey respondents, implying that the aging ability of hunters could theoretically improve with appropriate training. Dewlap size was a particularly reliable indicator of males ≥7 years and a review of online trophy galleries suggested its wider utility as an aging criterion. Our study demonstrated that an age-based hunting approach is practically applicable for leopards. However, implementation would require major reform within the regulatory framework and the hunting industry."
https://openalex.org/W1976792502,"Recent evidence suggests that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a death-inducing cytokine with anti-tumor potential, initiates apoptosis by re-organizing TRAIL receptors into large clusters, although the structure of these clusters and the mechanism by which they assemble are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TRAIL receptor 2 (DR5) forms receptor dimers in a ligand-dependent manner at endogenous receptor levels, and these receptor dimers exist within high molecular weight networks. Using mutational analysis, FRET, fluorescence microscopy, synthetic biochemistry, and molecular modeling, we find that receptor dimerization relies upon covalent and noncovalent interactions between membrane-proximal residues. Additionally, by using FRET, we show that the oligomeric structure of two functional isoforms of DR5 is indistinguishable. The resulting model of DR5 activation should revise the accepted architecture of the functioning units of DR5 and the structurally homologous TNF receptor superfamily members."
https://openalex.org/W2010276959,"The Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-associated co-repressor KAP1 is an essential nuclear co-repressor for the KRAB zinc finger protein superfamily of transcriptional factors. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-Chk2 and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 are two primary kinase signaling cascades activated in response to DNA damage. A growing body of evidence suggests that ATM and ATR phosphorylate KAP1 at Ser-824 in response to DNA damage and regulate KAP1-dependent chromatin condensation, DNA repair, and gene expression. Here, we show that, depending on the type of DNA damage that occurs, KAP1 Ser-473 can be phosphorylated by ATM-Chk2 or ATR-Chk1 kinases. Phosphorylation of KAP1 at Ser-473 attenuated its binding to the heterochromatin protein 1 family proteins and inhibited its transcriptional repression of KRAB-zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) target genes. Moreover, KAP1 Ser-473 phosphorylation induced by DNA damage stimulated KAP1-E2F1 binding. Overexpression of heterochromatin protein 1 significantly inhibited E2F1-KAP1 binding. Elimination of KAP1 Ser-473 phosphorylation increased E2F1-targeted proapoptotic gene expression and E2F1-induced apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, loss of phosphorylation of KAP1 Ser-473 led to less BRCA1 focus formation and slower kinetics of loss of γH2AX foci after DNA damage. KAP1 Ser-473 phosphorylation was required for efficient DNA repair and cell survival in response to DNA damage. Our studies reveal novel functions of KAP1 Ser-473 phosphorylation under stress."

https://openalex.org/W2002986373,"STAT3 was recently reported to suppress tumor invasion in Apc(min)(/+) mice. We investigated the mechanisms by which STAT3 inhibits intestinal epithelial tumors using Apc(min)(/+)/Stat3(IEC-KO) mice (intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of STAT3 in the Apc(min)(/+) background) to determine the role of STAT3 in carcinogenesis in vivo as well as colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro. To inhibit invasion of IEC tumors, STAT3 functions as a molecular adaptor rather than a transcription factor. Accordingly, the tumors in Apc(min)(/+)/Stat3(IEC-KO) mice undergo adenoma-to-carcinoma transition and acquire an invasive phenotype. Similarly, STAT3 knockdown in a colorectal cell line enhances IEC invasion. We demonstrate that STAT3 down-regulates SNAI (Snail-1) expression levels and hence suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition of colorectal cancer cells. Mechanistically, STAT3 facilitates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β-mediated degradation of SNAI by regulating phosphorylation of GSK3β. Our data identified a new role for STAT3 in the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence of intestinal tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2166850741,"Microorganisms such as plant pathogens secrete glycoside hydrolases (GHs) to digest the polysaccharide chains of plant cell walls. The degradation of cell walls by these enzymes is a crucial step for nutrition and invasion. To protect the cell wall from these enzymes, plants secrete glycoside hydrolase inhibitor proteins (GHIPs). Xyloglucan-specific endo-β-1,4-glucanase (XEG), a member of GH family 12 (GH12), could be a great threat to many plants because xyloglucan is a major component of the cell wall in most plants. Understanding the inhibition mechanism of XEG by GHIP is therefore of great importance in the field of plant defense, but to date the mechanism and specificity of GHIPs remain unclear. We have determined the crystal structure of XEG in complex with extracellular dermal glycoprotein (EDGP), a carrot GHIP that inhibits XEG. The structure reveals that the conserved arginines of EDGP intrude into the active site of XEG and interact with the catalytic glutamates of the enzyme. We have also determined the crystal structure of the XEG-xyloglucan complex. These structures show that EDGP closely mimics the XEG-xyloglucan interaction. Although EDGP shares structural similarity to a wheat GHIP (Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor-IA (TAXI-IA)) that inhibits GH11 family xylanases, the arrangement of GH and GHIP in the XEG-EDGP complex is distinct from that in the xylanase-TAXI-IA complex. Our findings imply that plants have evolved structures of GHIPs to inhibit different GH family members that attack their cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W2145563704,"Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of type B gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric adenocarcinoma and MALT lymphoma, uses the Cag type IV secretion system to induce a strong proinflammatory response in the gastric mucosa and to inject its effector protein CagA into gastric cells. CagA translocation results in altered host cell gene expression profiles and cytoskeletal rearrangements, and it is considered as a major bacterial virulence trait. Recently, it has been shown that binding of the type IV secretion apparatus to integrin receptors on target cells is a crucial step in the translocation process. Several bacterial proteins, including the Cag-specific components CagL and CagI, have been involved in this interaction. Here, we have examined the localization and interactions of CagI in the bacterial cell. Since the cagI gene overlaps and is co-transcribed with the cagL gene, the role of CagI for type IV secretion system function has been difficult to assess, and conflicting results have been reported regarding its involvement in the proinflammatory response. Using a marker-free gene deletion approach and genetic complementation, we show now that CagI is an essential component of the Cag type IV secretion apparatus for both CagA translocation and interleukin-8 induction. CagI is distributed over soluble and membrane-associated pools and seems to be partly surface-exposed. Deletion of several genes encoding essential Cag components has an impact on protein levels of CagI and CagL, suggesting that both proteins require partial assembly of the secretion apparatus. Finally, we show by co-immunoprecipitation that CagI and CagL interact with each other. Taken together, our results indicate that CagI and CagL form a functional complex which is formed at a late stage of secretion apparatus assembly."

However, no definitive proof of how the parasites reach the brain has been presented so far. Analyzing electron micrographs prepared from rodent brains more than 20 days after infection, we present here conclusive evidence that the parasites first enter the brain via the choroid plexus from where they penetrate the epithelial cell layer to reach the ventricular system. Adversely, no trypanosomes were observed within the parenchyma outside blood vessels. We also show that brain infection depends on the formation of long slender trypanosomes and that the cerebrospinal fluid as well as the stroma of the choroid plexus is a hostile environment for the survival of trypanosomes, which enter the pial space including the Virchow-Robin space via the subarachnoid space to escape degradation. Our data suggest that trypanosomes do not intend to colonize the brain but reside near or within the glia limitans, from where they can re-populate blood vessels and disrupt the sleep wake cycles."

https://openalex.org/W2121158220,"Background Recent reports have shown that vitamin D status was inversely associated with the risk of various cancers. However, few studies examined the association between vitamin D levels and risk of skin cancer. Methods We prospectively evaluated the association between baseline plasma 25(OH)D levels and the risk of incident squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) among 4,641 women from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) and the NHS II with 510 incident BCC cases and 75 incident SCC cases. We used multivariate logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results Plasma 25(OH)D levels were positively associated with risk of BCC after adjusting for age at blood draw, season of blood draw, lab batch, hair color, burning tendency, the number of sunburns, and ultra-violet B flux of residence at blood collection. Women in the highest quartile of 25(OH)D had more than 2-fold increased risk of BCC compared with women in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.52–2.80, P for trend <0.0001). We also found a significantly positive association between plasma 25(OH)D levels and SCC risk after adjusting for the same covariates (OR, highest vs. lowest quartile = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.70–8.36, P for trend = 0.0002). Conclusion In this prospective study of women, plasma vitamin D levels were positively associated with non-melanoma skin cancer risk. Considering that most circulating vitamin D is due to sun exposure, the positive association between plasma vitamin D and non-melanoma skin cancer is confounded by sun exposure. Our data suggest that one-time measurement of plasma vitamin D levels may reasonably reflect long-term sun exposure and predict the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2035056945,"Members of the PUF (Pumilio and FBF) and CPEB (cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding) protein families collaborate to regulate mRNA expression throughout eukaryotes. Here, we focus on the physical interactions between members of these two families, concentrating on Caenorhabditis elegans FBF-2 and CPB-1. To localize the site of interaction on FBF-2, we identified conserved amino acids within C. elegans PUF proteins. Deletion of an extended loop containing several conserved residues abolished binding to CPB-1. We analyzed alanine substitutions at 13 individual amino acids in FBF-2, each identified via its conservation. Multiple single point mutations disrupted binding to CPB-1 but not to RNA. Position Tyr-479 was particularly critical as multiple substitutions to other amino acids at this position did not restore binding. The complex of FBF-2 and CPB-1 repressed translation of an mRNA containing an FBF binding element. Repression required both proteins and was disrupted by FBF-2 alleles that failed to bind CPB-1 or RNA. The equivalent loop in human PUM2 is required for binding to human CPEB3 in vitro, although the primary sequences of the human and C. elegans PUF proteins have diverged in that region. Our findings define a key region in PUF/CPEB interactions and imply a conserved platform through which PUF proteins interact with their protein partners."
https://openalex.org/W1970972342,"Archaeal promoters consist of a TATA box and a purine-rich adjacent upstream sequence (transcription factor B (TFB)-responsive element (BRE)), which are bound by the transcription factors TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and TFB. Currently, only a few activators of archaeal transcription have been experimentally characterized. The best studied activator, Ptr2, mediates activation by recruitment of TBP. Here, we present a detailed biochemical analysis of an archaeal transcriptional activator, PF1088, which was identified in Pyrococcus furiosus by a bioinformatic approach. Operon predictions suggested that an upstream gene, pf1089, is polycistronically transcribed with pf1088. We demonstrate that PF1088 stimulates in vitro transcription by up to 7-fold when the pf1089 promoter is used as a template. By DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments, we show that the binding site of PF1088 is located directly upstream of the BRE of pf1089. Mutational analysis indicated that activation requires the presence of the binding site for PF1088. Furthermore, we show that activation of transcription by PF1088 is dependent upon the presence of an imperfect BRE and is abolished when the pf1089 BRE is replaced with a BRE from a strong archaeal promoter. Gel shift experiments showed that TFB recruitment to the pf1089 operon is stimulated by PF1088, and TFB seems to stabilize PF1088 operator binding even in the absence of TBP. Taken together, these results represent the first biochemical evidence for a transcriptional activator working as a TFB recruitment factor in Archaea, for which the designation TFB-RF1 is suggested.

In contrast to the high similarity between the basal transcription machinery of the Archaea and Eukarya, the regulation of transcription fits more into the bacterial schema. All archaea encode a large number of proteins containing the helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains, whose sequences closely resemble bacterial helix-turn-helix domains (13.Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

The great majority analyzed so far act as transcriptional repressors (reviewed in Refs. 4.Geiduschek E.P. Ouhammouch M. Archaeal transcription and its regulators.Mol.

The Lrp family of transcriptional regulators in archaea.Archaea. 2010; 2010: 750457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In most cases, the bound repressor prevents the recruitment of the RNAP, and in some cases, the binding of TBP or TFB (or both) is inhibited. There are also some known instances of positive control in Archaea, with Ptr2 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii being the most well characterized (18.Ouhammouch M. Dewhurst R.E. Hausner W. Thomm M.

Promoter architecture and response to a positive regulator of archaeal transcription.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This Lrp family protein binds cooperatively to sequences upstream of the TATA box and stimulates transcription via recruitment of TBP. A similar mechanism is likely used by GvpE, a protein with a eukaryote-like basic leucine zipper DNA-binding domain that activates genes involved in gas vesicle production in halophiles (20.Teufel K. Pfeifer F. Interaction of transcriptional activator GvpE with TATA box-binding proteins of Halobacterium salinarum.Arch. Microbiol. 2010; 192: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Additional examples of transcriptional activators exist, but the molecular details of the mechanism of activation are unknown in these cases. In Pyrococcus furiosus, SurR and TrmBL1 can act as transcriptional repressors as well as activators (21.Lipscomb G.L. Keese A.M. Cowart D.M. Schut G.J. Thomm M. Adams M.W. Scott R.A.

SurR is involved in the regulation of hydrogen and elemental sulfur metabolism, whereas TrmBL1 plays a role in the regulation of sugar metabolism. To elucidate the potential of archaeal transcriptional regulators in more detail, we recently performed a computational screen to identify putative transcriptional regulators and their corresponding DNA-binding sites. 3M. T. Weirauch, S. M. Ochs, W. Hausner, M. Thomm, and T. M. Lowe, manuscript in preparation. Here, we report a detailed biochemical analysis of one of these predictions, the putative transcriptional regulator PF1088 and the corresponding binding site. Our data clearly demonstrate that this protein activates transcription via a novel mechanism involving the stimulation of TFB recruitment to an archaeal promoter. The purification of RNAP and the transcription factors TBP and TFB was performed as described previously (24.Kostrewa D. Zeller M.E. Armache K.J. Seizl M. Leike K. Thomm M. Cramer P. RNA polymerase II-TFIIB structure and mechanism of transcription initiation.Nature. 2009; 462: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For the purification of PF1088, the corresponding gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-14b (Novagen). The coding sequence was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA from P. furiosus using primers TAGGGAGATCATATGGAAGAAAT and TGGATCCTTAAAAATGTATTGCATCGATTACTGTCT. Amplification products were digested with BamHI and NdeI (underlined in the primer sequences) and ligated into vector pET-14b. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)-CP (Stratagene) transformed with the corresponding plasmid was grown in 400 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Protein expression of PF1088 was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The bacterial culture was further incubated for additional 5 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 20 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 15% glycerol. Cell lysis was done by the addition of lysozyme for 1 h at 37 °C following sonification. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min, the soluble crude extract was exposed to 65 °C for 10 min to denature most of the heat-sensitive E. coli proteins. After a second centrifugation step at 50,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was applied to a 1-ml nickel column (HiTrap HP, GE Healthcare). Bound proteins were eluted with an increasing imidazole concentration up to 500 mm. Further purification was achieved by gel filtration chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75, GE Healthcare) with 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, and 15% glycerol. The promoter region of pf1089 was amplified by PCR using primers 1089Fd150 (5′-CAAACCTAAGCTCTGAACTACAGAG-3′) and 1089Rd150 (5′-TAAATGCCCGTATATTTAGGTGC-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into the SmaI restriction site of the pUC19 vector to create pf1089_MUR9. The gdhC20 plasmid was used for control experiments (25.Spitalny P. Thomm M. Analysis of the open region and of DNA-protein contacts of archaeal RNA polymerase transcription complexes during transition from initiation to elongation.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30497-30505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mutated promoter templates pf1089Mu1_MUR10, pf1089Mu2_MUR11, gdhC20Mu4_MUR12, and gdhC20Mu5_MUR13 were constructed following the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). The pf1089Mu1 mutation was generated using primers BRE-Mu-1089F (5′-CCTAAGCTCTGAACTACAGAGTTTGCGAAAAGTATAAATACCTCTACCTCC-3′) and BRE-Mu-1089R (5′-GGAGGTAGAGGTATTTATACTTTTCGCAAACTCTGTAGTTCAGAGCTTAGG-3′). The pf1089Mu2 and the gdhC20Mu4 mutations were generated using primer pairs TATA-Mu-1089F (5′-CTACAGAGTTTGACCTGAGTTTATATACCTCTACCTCCATTTAA-3′)/TATA-Mu-1089R (5′-TTAAATGGAGGTAGAGGTATATAAACTCAGGTCAAACTCTGTAG-3′) and gdhF (5′-CAAAAGGATTTCCACTCTTGTTTACACCTGGCTTTATATAGGCTATTGCCC-3′)/BRE-Mu-gdhR (5′-GGGCAATAGCCTATATAAAGCCAGGTGTAAACAAGAGTGGAAATCCTTTTG-5′). For the mutant gdhC20Mu5, the 5′-phosphorylated primers Bdst-BRE-Mu-gdhF (5′-GAGTTTCACCTGGCTTTATATAGGCTATTGCCCAAAAATGTATCG-3′) and Bdst-BRE-Mu-gdhR (5′-TGTAGTTCAGAGCTTTTGTTTATTTGATTAGGCTCAAAGAATC-3′) and pUC19/gdhC20 as a template were used in combination with the Phusion® site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Finnzymes). The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing analysis. DNA templates were obtained from genomic DNA by PCR amplification with the corresponding primer pairs. One of the two primers was labeled at the 5′-end with 6-FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein) or Cy5. 5 nm DNA was incubated with 250 nm recombinant PF1088 in a 15-μl reaction volume containing the following buffer: 10% glycerol, 80 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 m KCl, 40 μg/ml BSA, and 50 μg/ml HindIII-digested λ DNA as a competitor. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 70 °C and analyzed using a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the DNA fragments were visualized with a Fujifilm FLA-5000 fluorescence imager. 13 nm template DNA and 1.45 μm PF1088 were incubated under the conditions used for the EMSAs. 0.01 unit of DNase I (1 μl; Fermentas) was added for 1–5 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 95% formamide. After the addition of 0.3 m sodium acetate and 2 mg/ml glycogen (final concentrations), the DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 3 μl of formamide buffer. A DNA sequencing ladder was generated using the same primer as a molecular mass standard. Samples were loaded onto a 4.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using an ABI 377 DNA sequencer. 15.6 nm template DNA and 3.48 μm PF1088 were incubated in 25 μl of radical reaction buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m KCl, and 2.5 mm MgCl2) together with HindIII-digested λ DNA (1 ng/μl) as a competitor for 20 min at 70 °C. 5 mm Fe(II)(NH4)2(SO4)2·(H2O)6, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m sodium ascorbate, and 10% H2O2 were added to start the cleavage reaction. Note that it is important to add H2O2 last because this starts the generation of hydroxyl radicals. After 1–2 min of incubation at 70 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 75 μl of radical stop buffer (13 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm thiourea, 0.3% SDS, and 1.3% glycerol). The DNA fragments were precipitated with ethanol and analyzed as described above. In vitro transcription reactions were performed in principle as described (26.Hethke C. Bergerat A. Hausner W. Forterre P. Thomm M. Cell-free transcription at 95°: thermostability of transcriptional components and DNA topology requirements of Pyrococcus transcription.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1325-1333PubMed Google Scholar). For basal transcription, reaction mixtures were assembled in 25 μl (final volume) of transcription buffer (40 mm NaHEPES (pH 7.3), 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 20 mm potassium glutamate). 4 nm template DNA was combined with 95 nm TBP, 30 nm TFB, and 11 nm RNAP. Transcription was initiated by the addition of ATP, CTP, and GTP to a final concentration of 40 μm and UTP to a final concentration of 2.68 μm, including 2 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). After incubation at 80 °C for 15 min, the transcripts was analyzed as described (26.Hethke C. Bergerat A. Hausner W. Forterre P. Thomm M. Cell-free transcription at 95°: thermostability of transcriptional components and DNA topology requirements of Pyrococcus transcription.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1325-1333PubMed Google Scholar). Primer extension experiments were carried out with RNA from the in vitro transcription reaction of template pf1089 and the 5′-FAM-labeled primer FD50_FAM (5′-TATTAAAGGGAATTGTTGATACTCTTAAG-3′). After denaturing RNA and primers at 70 °C for 5 min, dNTPs and reverse transcriptase (RNase H−, Promega) were added in the recommended buffer and incubated at 50 °C for 60 min. The cDNA was then purified by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in 4 μl of loading buffer (1:4 dextran blue/formamide), and analyzed on a denaturing urea-4.5% polyacrylamide gel together with sequencing reactions performed with the same primer. The products were analyzed using an ABI 377 sequencer. The PF1088 protein of P. furiosus was identified as a putative transcriptional regulator using a bioinformatic approach.3 To study the function of this putative regulator in more detail, we expressed the protein in E. coli using an N-terminal His6 tag for purification of the protein. The purified protein had an apparent molecular mass of 13.8 kDa under denaturing conditions (Fig. 1A). The DNA-binding properties of PF1088 were first characterized using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As this gene is most likely located within an operon structure together with pf1089, we used the upstream sequence of pf1089 for binding experiments. Using 5 nm upstream DNA of pf1089, we obtained a specific DNA-protein complex in the presence of 50–250 nm PF1088 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–6). Experiments with control DNA exhibited no specific binding of PF1088 (Fig. 1B, lanes 7–12). To localize the specific binding site of the putative transcriptional regulator in more detail, we prepared PCR-amplified templates with different upstream regions from positions −220 to −53 with respect to the transcription start site of pf1089 (determined in Fig. 3B). The upstream region could be deleted up to position −67 without any changes in the binding properties of PF1088 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 1 and 6). In contrast, further deletion of the upstream region up to position −53 resulted in loss of the electrophoretic mobility shift (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). This indicates that the upstream boundary of the binding site of the transcriptional regulator PF1088 is located in the upstream sequence of pf1089 between positions −53 and −67. To determine the binding site in the upstream region of pf1089 more exactly, we applied DNase I footprinting experiments using fluorescently labeled DNA fragments of the non-template and template strands. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper panel), PF1088 protected a region from −60 to −37 on the non-template strand from DNase I digestion (compare lanes 2–6 with control lanes 8–12). On the template strand, the binding of PF1088 was in the range of positions −62 to −41 (Fig. 2A, lower panel). For a more precise localization of the binding site, we performed hydroxyl radical footprinting assays. Hydroxyl radicals have the advantage of cleaving DNA without any sequence preference, and the small radicals allow a much higher resolution of DNA-protein contacts in comparison with DNase I (27.Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E. Kam L. Hydroxyl radical footprinting: a high-resolution method for mapping protein-DNA contacts.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We used the same DNA fragments as used for the DNase I footprints. To our knowledge, these are the first experiments using hydroxyl radical footprints with fluorescently labeled DNA fragments. The problem is that the radicals also attack the chromatophore, and therefore, the strength of the signals goes down in comparison with the DNase I footprints. The results of the hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments are shown in Fig. 2B. Positions −49/−50 and −58/−59 on the non-template strand (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and positions −41/−42 and −50/−51 on the template strand (lower panel) were protected from cleavage (compare lanes 1 and 2 with control lanes 3 and 4). The results of the DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments are summarized in Fig. 2C. The indicated boundary positions are relative to the mapped start site of transcription (Fig. 3B). As archaeal promoter elements are usually located about −37 to −25 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site, we highlighted the putative BRE and the TATA box in Fig. 2C in gray (9.Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P. Orientation of the transcription preinitiation complex in archaea.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Elements of an archaeal promoter defined by mutational analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5423-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Taken together, the footprinting data clearly indicate that the binding site of PF1088 is located directly upstream of the archaeal promoter, consistent with the assumption that this protein is most likely an activator of archaeal transcription. To investigate the effects of PF1088 on transcription, we employed an in vitro transcription system reconstituted from highly purified RNAP from P. furiosus and recombinant transcription factors TBP and TFB (26.Hethke C. Bergerat A. Hausner W. Forterre P. Thomm M. Cell-free transcription at 95°: thermostability of transcriptional components and DNA topology requirements of Pyrococcus transcription.Genetics. 1999; 152: 1325-1333PubMed Google Scholar). Using the upstream sequence of pf1089 as a template in in vitro transcription reactions, we confirmed that this gene can be weakly transcribed in our system and that the addition of PF1088 increases the transcription product (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 7 and 8). Quantification of the transcripts with increasing amounts of PF1088 revealed an ∼3.5–7-fold activation. As expected, using the gdh promoter as a template, the addition of increasing amounts of PF1088 had no effect on transcription efficiency (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–7). These data clearly demonstrate that the transcriptional regulator PF1088 is able to activate transcription specifically at the pf1089 promoter. To localize the binding site of PF1088 with regard to the promoter of the template pf1089, we used a primer extension experiment with in vitro RNA synthesized in the presence of PF1088 (Fig. 3B). The mapped transcript started with a guanine nucleotide, and a preceding thymine is in perfect agreement with the consensus sequence of an archaeal initiator element (28.Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. Control regions of an archaeal gene. A TATA box and an initiator element promote cell-free transcription of the tRNAVal gene of Methanococcus vannielii.J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29.Hain J. Reiter W.D. Hüdepohl U. Zillig W. Elements of an archaeal promoter defined by mutational analysis.Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5423-5428Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The transcription start site and the derived promoter sequence of pf1089 are indicated in the DNA sequence of Fig. 2C. The mapped position of the transcription start site confirmed that the binding site of PF1088 is located directly upstream of the archaeal promoter and is therefore in perfect agreement with the finding that this protein is a transcriptional activator. To gain further insight into the mechanism of activation, we performed in vitro transcription experiments with varying concentrations of RNAP, TBP, and TFB. For each experiment, the -fold activation was determined. Fig. 3C summarizes the results. Varying the concentration of RNAP from 20 to 100 nm did not dramatically change the -fold activation (Fig. 3C, triangles). As expected, reduced concentrations of TBP decreased the -fold activation because, in this case, the binding of TBP is most likely a rate-limiting step (Fig. 3C, circles). The most interesting result from these experiments is that limited TFB concentrations are particularly sensitive to PF1088 activation, whereas increasing concentrations reduce the level of activation (Fig. 3C, squares). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the presence of PF1088 stimulates binding of TFB to the promoter. The BRE located directly upstream of the TATA box plays an important role in the recruitment of TFB to the DNA-TBP complex (9.Bell S.D. Kosa P.L. Sigler P.B. Jackson S.P.

Recently, the sequence 5′-VRAAA-3′ was proposed as a consensus sequence for the BRE in Pyrococcus (30.van de Werken H.J. Verhees C.H. Akerboom J. de Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Identification of a glycolytic regulon in the archaea PyrococcusThermococcus.FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2006; 260: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As the most likely corresponding BRE (5′-CCTGA-3′) of the pf1089 promoter shows some distinct deviations from the consensus sequence, we assume that this element has a reduced affinity for TFB recruitment. To test this hypothesis, mutational analysis of the pf1089 promoter elements was performed by introducing promoter elements of the strong gdh promoter (Fig. 4A). The exchange of the weak BRE of the pf1089 promoter with the strong BRE of the gdh promoter with the BRE consensus sequence 5′-CGAAA-3′ resulted in a strong increase in transcription of the template pf1089Mu1, even in the absence of the activator PF1088 (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 5). Furthermore, the addition of PF1088 did not increase the strength of the transcription signal of the pf1089Mu1 template (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–8). Transcription experiments performed with the gdh promoter with the weak BRE site from the pf1089 promoter (template gdhC20Mu4) showed a reduced activity in comparison with the corresponding wild-type gdh promoter (Fig. 4B, lanes 13 and 17). As expected, the presence of PF1088 had no influence on transcription of this template (Fig. 4B, lanes 18–20) because the binding site of PF1088 is missing. The introduction of the PF1088-binding site into the gdh template (template gdhC20Mu5) enabled PF1088-dependent activation of transcription by up to 2-fold (Fig. 4B, lanes 21–24). This -fold activation is in a similar range to that obtained for the pf1089 template with the strong TATA box from the gdh promoter (pf1089Mu2) (Fig. 4B, lanes 9–12). We suggest that, in these cases, the presence of the strong TATA box shifted the rate-limiting step in transcription initiation from TBP binding to TFB recruitment, making activation of these mutants still possible. In contrast, the binding of TBP to DNA is the rate-limiting step for the mutant with the weak TATA box, and therefore, no activation was observed. To gain a further understanding of the underlying mechanisms, we performed additional experiments analyzing a subset of these mutated templates by EMSAs. We found a striking difference between the strong gdh and weak pf1089 promoters. In the case of the pf1089 promoter, no stable DNA-TBP-TFB shift could be observed (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 2 and 5). The addition of PF1088 did not change the composition of the DNA-TBP-TFB complex on the gdh promoter but allowed the formation of specific DNA-PF1088 as well as DNA-TBP-TFB-PF1088 complexes on the pf1089 template (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 6). (The sizes of the DNA fragments are different, and therefore, these distinct complexes were located within the gel at different positions.) Using pf1089Mu1 with the strong BRE as a template resulted in a specific TBP-TFB shift (Fig. 4C, lane 8). This suggests that the sequence of the BRE provides a significant contribution to the stability of the TBP-TFB complex. The addition of PF1088 led to the formation of a further retarded band, indicating the formation of a stable TBP-TFB-PF1088 complex (Fig. 4C, lane 9). Similar behavior was observed for the gdhC20Mu5 templa"

To study this disease, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) models are widely used to mimic the process of transient blockage and subsequent recovery of cardiac coronary blood supply. We aimed to determine whether the presence of the growth hormone secretagogues, ghrelin and hexarelin, would protect/improve the function of heart from I/R injury and to examine the underlying mechanisms.Isolated hearts from adult male mice underwent 20 min global ischemia and 30 min reperfusion using a Langendorff apparatus. Ghrelin (10 nM) or hexarelin (1 nM) was introduced into the perfusion system either 10 min before or after ischemia, termed pre- and post-treatments. In freshly isolated cardiomyocytes from these hearts, single cell shortening, intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients and caffeine-releasable sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) were measured. In addition, RT-PCR and Western blots were used to examine the expression level of GHS receptor type 1a (GHS-R1a), and phosphorylated phospholamban (p-PLB), respectively. Ghrelin and hexarelin pre- or post-treatments prevented the significant reduction in the cell shortening, [Ca(2+)](i) transient amplitude and caffeine-releasable SR Ca(2+) content after I/R through recovery of p-PLB. GHS-R1a antagonists, [D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 (200 nM) and BIM28163 (100 nM), completely blocked the effects of GHS on both cell shortening and [Ca(2+)](i) transients.Through activation of GHS-R1a, ghrelin and hexarelin produced a positive inotropic effect on ischemic cardiomyocytes and protected them from I/R injury probably by protecting or recovering p-PLB (and therefore SR Ca(2+) content) to allow the maintenance or recovery of normal cardiac contractility. These observations provide supporting evidence for the potential therapeutic application of ghrelin and hexarelin in patients with cardiac I/R injury."
https://openalex.org/W2057277886,"Complications of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are usually caused by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). In a similar way as in the optic nerve, elevated ICP could also compromise the olfactory nerve system. On the other side, there is growing evidence that an extensive lymphatic network system around the olfactory nerves could be disturbed in cerebrospinal fluid disorders like IIH. The hypothesis that patients with IIH suffer from hyposmia has been suggested in the past. However, this has not been proven in clinical studies yet. This pilot study investigates whether structural changes of the olfactory nerve system can be detected in patients with IIH.Twenty-three patients with IIH and 23 matched controls were included. Olfactory bulb volume (OBV) and sulcus olfactorius (OS) depth were calculated by magnetic resonance techniques. While mean values of total OBV (128.7±38.4 vs. 130.0±32.6 mm(3), p=0.90) and mean OS depth (8.5±1.2 vs. 8.6±1.1 mm, p=0.91) were similar in both groups, Pearson correlation showed that patients with a shorter medical history IIH revealed a smaller OBV (r=0.53, p<0.01). In untreated symptomatic patients (n=7), the effect was greater (r=0.76, p<0.05). Patients who suffered from IIH for less than one year (n=8), total OBV was significantly smaller than in matched controls (116.6±24.3 vs. 149.3±22.2 mm(3), p=0.01). IIH patients with visual disturbances (n=21) revealed a lower OS depth than patients without (8.3±0.9 vs. 10.8±1.0 mm, p<0.01).The results suggest that morphological changes of the olfactory nerve system could be present in IIH patients at an early stage of disease."

These cells are highly motile and metastatic and are characterized by high levels of the metastasis regulator protein SLUG. Using isogenic breast cancer cell systems we have shown here that high motility of these cells is directly correlated with the levels of the SLUG in these cells. Because epithelial/mesenchymal cell motility is known to be negatively regulated by the catenin protein plakoglobin, we postulated that the transcriptional repressor protein SLUG increases the motility of the aggressive breast cancer cells through the knockdown of the transcription of the plakoglobin gene. We found that SLUG inhibits the expression of plakoglobin gene directly in these cells. Overexpression of SLUG in the SLUG-deficient cancer cells significantly decreased the levels of mRNA and protein of plakoglobin. On the contrary, knockdown of SLUG in SLUG-high cancer cells elevated the levels of plakoglobin. Blocking of SLUG function with a double-stranded DNA decoy that competes with the E2-box binding of SLUG also increased the levels of plakoglobin mRNA, protein, and promoter activity in the SLUG-high triple negative breast cancer cells. Overexpression of SLUG in the SLUG-deficient cells elevated the motility of these cells. Knockdown of plakoglobin in these low motility non-invasive breast cancer cells rearranged the actin filaments and increased the motility of these cells.

Evidence presented here suggests that SLUG regulates the motility of these cells by directly suppressing the transcription of the plakoglobin gene through chromatin remodeling. We also have shown that knockdown of plakoglobin in the SLUG-negative breast cancer cells leads to the rearrangement of the actin filaments and formation of actin-rich membrane ruffling resembling invadopodia (25Ridley A.J.

Forced expression of plakoglobin in the SLUG-high breast cancer cells has the similar effect on their motility as that with SLUG knockdown. All the cells used in this study were procured from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and were cultured in ATCC-recommended media (12Mittal M.K. Singh K. Misra S. Chaudhuri G.

The amplified cDNA (831 bp) was sequence-verified, digested with ClaI/BamHI, and cloned at the ClaI/BamHI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV-14 plasmid (Sigma). MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells were transfected with the SLUG ORF construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, cells were plated in G418-containing medium to select a stable cell population expressing SLUG. The non-functional mutant of SLUG, in which the SLUG domain amino acid sequence PSDTSSK was changed to AAAAAAA, was generated from the wild-type SLUG construct as a template using recombination PCR and cloned into the BamHI/ClaI site of the multiple cloning site of p3XFLAG-CMV-14 vector (Sigma). Briefly, the wild-type SLUG construct was used as a template to amplify overlapping fragments template 1 (T1) and template 2 (T2) using specifically designed primers (supplemental Table S1). The mutated nucleotides are underlined. The gel-purified amplicons (T1 and T2) were used as templates to perform recombination PCR to generate the mutant. The gel-purified mutant amplicon was digested with BamHI and ClaI and column-purified. The amplicon was then cloned at the BamHI/ClaI sites of p3XFLAG-CMV14 plasmid (Sigma). Human plakoglobin ORF cloned in the plasmid pcDNA3.0 (plasmid number 16827) was procured from Addgene (28Caca K. Kolligs F.T. Ji X. Hayes M. Qian J. Yahanda A. Rimm D.L. Costa J.

The efficiency of expression of the cloned mRNAs and proteins in the recombinant cells was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively (12Mittal M.K. Singh K. Misra S.

Plakoglobin siRNA (#6226) and control siRNA (#6568S) were procured from Cell Signaling Technology. We also designed stealth siRNAs against human plakoglobin (supplemental Table S2), and they had comparable efficacies to knockdown the plakoglobin gene (data not shown). Transfection of these siRNAs into the breast cancer cells was done by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol (12Mittal M.K. Singh K. Misra S.

Briefly, cells were transfected at ∼50% confluency using 100 pmol of the siRNA in 6-well plates, and whole-cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. RNA was isolated from these cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The efficiency of knockdown of the target genes was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis (12Mittal M.K. Singh K. Misra S.

https://openalex.org/W2005777912,"NMDA receptors (NMDARs) form glutamate-gated ion channels that play a critical role in CNS physiology and pathology. Together with AMPA and kainate receptors, NMDARs are known to operate as tetrameric complexes with four membrane-embedded subunits associating to form a single central ion-conducting pore. While AMPA and some kainate receptors can function as homomers, NMDARs are obligatory heteromers composed of homologous but distinct subunits, most usually of the GluN1 and GluN2 types. A fundamental structural feature of NMDARs, that of the subunit arrangement around the ion pore, is still controversial. Thus, in a typical NMDAR associating two GluN1 and two GluN2 subunits, there is evidence for both alternating 1/2/1/2 and non-alternating 1/1/2/2 arrangements. Here, using a combination of electrophysiological and cross-linking experiments, we provide evidence that functional GluN1/GluN2A receptors adopt the 1/2/1/2 arrangement in which like subunits are diagonal to one another. Moreover, based on the recent crystal structure of an AMPA receptor, we show that in the agonist-binding and pore regions, the GluN1 subunits occupy a ""proximal"" position, closer to the central axis of the channel pore than that of GluN2 subunits. Finally, results obtained with reducing agents that differ in their membrane permeability indicate that immature (intracellular) and functional (plasma-membrane inserted) pools of NMDARs can adopt different subunit arrangements, thus stressing the importance of discriminating between the two receptor pools in assembly studies. Elucidating the quaternary arrangement of NMDARs helps to define the interface between the subunits and to understand the mechanism and pharmacology of these key signaling receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2092906222,"How microorganisms obtain energy is a challenging topic, and there have been numerous studies on the mechanisms involved. Here, we focus on the energy substrate traffic in the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. This bacterium can use insoluble sulfur as an energy substrate and has an intricate sulfur energy metabolism involving several sulfur-reducing and -oxidizing supercomplexes and enzymes. We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic rhodanese SbdP participates in this sulfur energy metabolism. Rhodaneses are a widespread family of proteins known to transfer sulfur atoms. We show that SbdP has also some unusual characteristics compared with other rhodaneses; it can load a long sulfur chain, and it can interact with more than one partner. Its partners (sulfur reductase and sulfur oxygenase reductase) are key enzymes of the sulfur energy metabolism of A. aeolicus and share the capacity to use long sulfur chains as substrate. We demonstrate a positive effect of SbdP, once loaded with sulfur chains, on sulfur reductase activity, most likely by optimizing substrate uptake. Taken together, these results lead us to propose a physiological role for SbdP as a carrier and sulfur chain donor to these key enzymes, therefore enabling channeling of sulfur substrate in the cell as well as greater efficiency of the sulfur energy metabolism of A. aeolicus."

Plasma membrane glycoproteins are potential biomarkers because they may be reduced or even absent in plasma membranes of glycosylation-deficient cells. We combined stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) with linear ion trap mass spectrometry (LTQ OrbitrapTM) to identify and quantify membrane proteins from wild-type CHO and glycosylation-deficient CHO (Lec9) cells. We identified 165 underrepresented proteins from 1447 unique quantified proteins, including 18 N-glycosylated plasma membrane proteins. Using various methods, we found that intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) was reduced in Lec9 cells and in fibroblasts from 31 congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG) patients compared with normal controls. Mannose supplementation of phosphomannose isomerase-deficient CDG-Ib (MPI-CDG) cells and complementation with PMM2 in PMM2-deficient CDG-Ia (PMM2-CDG) cells partially corrected hypoglycosylation based on increased ICAM-1 presence on the plasma membrane.

Sharma V. Metabolic manipulation of glycosylation disorders in humans and animal models.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This results in unoccupied glycosylation sites (type I) or altered processing of protein-bound sugar chains (type II). Mutations in over 35 genes in the N-glycosylation pathway are thought to affect >1000 patients, but the actual number of patients and distinct disorders is probably much higher. Patients exhibit highly variable motor and intellectual disabilities, seizures, developmental delays, hypoglycemia, and clotting and digestion abnormalities (2.Freeze H.H. Congenital disorders of glycosylation: CDG-I, CDG-II, and beyond.Curr. Mol. Med. 2007; 7: 389-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). congenital disorder(s) of glycosylation intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture immunofluorescence. Serum transferrin is a widely used marker to initially identify N-glycosylation-deficient patients based on the absence or abnormality of the attached sugar chains. However, transferrin does not detect all N-glycosylation defects (3.Westphal V. Xiao M. Kwok P.Y. Freeze H.H. Identification of a frequent variant in ALG6, the cause of congenital disorder of glycosylation Ic.Hum. Mutat. 2003; 22: 420-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and does not pinpoint the defective gene (4.Marklová E. Albahri Z. Screening and diagnosis of congenital disorders of glycosylation.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 385: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More important, there is currently no corresponding indicator of reduced glycosylation in patient cells. Having such a marker would be useful to test potential therapeutics in glycosylation-deficient cells by restoring N-glycosylation of the marker. A marker could also be used to test gene complementation in glycosylation-deficient cells. This would be an important tool to verify candidate defective genes identified by whole exome sequencing. Proteins with unoccupied glycosylation sites are often degraded by glycoprotein quality control mechanisms (5.Ellgaard L. Helenius A. ER quality control: towards an understanding at the molecular level.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and fail to reach the plasma membrane. Such proteins might show lower expression in glycosylation-deficient cells and could be potential markers of hypoglycosylation. We applied quantitative proteomics to profile and quantify membrane proteins from wild-type CHO cells (Pro5) and Lec9 CHO cells, which have a defect in the synthesis of dolichol, a critical lipid needed for N-glycosylation (6.Rosenwald A.G. Krag S.S. Lec9 CHO glycosylation mutants are defective in the synthesis of dolichol.J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 523-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found lower levels of intercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) in Lec9 cells. We extended this to a series of 31 type I CDG fibroblasts and verified ICAM-1 as a potential hypoglycosylation biomarker for gene complementation and therapeutic improvement. Most of the reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. α-Minimal essential medium and DMEM with and without glucose were obtained from Mediatech, Inc. (Manassas, VA).

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate was purchased from Thermo Scientific (Wilmington, DE). WesternBright Quantum was obtained from Advansta (Menlo Park, CA). An Immun-Star WesternC kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Nitrocellulose membrane was purchased from Whatman (Dassel, Germany). Eight-chamber tissue culture-treated glass slides were purchased from BD Biosciences. Wild-type CHO cells (Pro5) and CHO cells with a genetic defect in dolichol synthesis (Lec9) were maintained in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Normal and CDG patient fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM (with 1 g/liter glucose) with 10% FBS. HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM (with 4.5g/liter glucose) and 10% FBS. All cells were maintained in the recommended media at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The Pro5 and Lec9 cells were labeled by isotope as recommended in the SILAC kit instructions. Briefly, heavy l-[U-13C6]lysine and light l-[U-12C6]lysine were added to RPMI 1640 medium with 10% dialyzed FBS, which was used to culture Lec9 (heavy) and Pro5 (light) cells for six doubling times (∼4 days) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Approximately 2.5 × 106 Pro5 and Lec9 cells grown as described above were mixed at a 1:1 ratio. Extraction of membrane proteins were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. SILAC-labeled membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and digested in methanol/water solution according to a previously reported protocol (7.Blonder J. Goshe M.B. Moore R.J. Pasa-Tolic L. Masselon C.D. Lipton M.S. Smith R.D. Enrichment of integral membrane proteins for proteomic analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the addition of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, the sample was incubated at 90 °C for 20 min, cooled, and diluted with methanol to yield a 60% (v/v) solution. Proteins were digested with trypsin overnight at 37 °C, and the solution was evaporated in a SpeedVac concentrator. The peptides were redissolved in 200 μl of 95% buffer containing 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid and 5% buffer containing 25% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 500 mm KCl. Peptides were first separated by strong cation exchange HPLC with a PolySULFOETHYL ATM column (Michrom Bioresources, Inc., Auburn, CA). Twelve strong cation exchange fractions were collected and subjected to reverse-phase LC-MS/MS analysis using a Paradigm HPLC Magic C18 column (0.2 × 150 mm; Michrom Bioresources, Inc.) and an LTQ OrbitrapTM XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The peptides were separated by 60–120 min of 5–40% buffer containing 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid, and spectra were collected in a data-dependent mode. Each scan was set to acquire a full MS scan, followed by MS/MS scans on the four most intense precursor ions. Functional classifications were performed with Gene Ontology annotation. Both the protein identification and the SILAC quantification were performed using IP2 v1.01 (Integrated Proteomics Applications, San Diego, CA). First, MS1 and MS2 files were extracted by RawExtractor v1.9 (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The genomic sequence of the CHO-K1 cell line was published recently (8.Xu X. Nagarajan H.

The genomic sequence of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cell line.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), and the data were not accessible when we performed the protein identification. Therefore, a database including the International Protein Index mouse database (v3.73) plus ∼500 available Chinese hamster proteins was uploaded into IP2, which automatically generated a reverse protein database. The MS1 and MS2 files were searched using ProLuCID and the decoy database, with 50 ppm precursor mass tolerance and semitryptic specificity. Variable modifications included 16 Da on methionine and 6 Da on lysine. At least two peptides were required for each protein. The DTASelect parameters were carefully set so that the final false positive rate was 1.77%, and the false positive rate at the peptide level was 1.01%. Quantification analysis was then selected for SILAC, and the protein ratios and S.D. were calculated by Census on IP2. We also performed the data analysis using the recently published CHO-K1 genome database. The results were very similar, and all of the previously established marker candidates were still in the identification list. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described by Jones et al. (9.Jones M.A. Ng B.G. Bhide S. Chin E. Rhodenizer D. He P. Losfeld M.E. He M. Raymond K. Berry G. Freeze H.H. Hegde M.R.

For detection of ICAM-1 in human fibroblasts, ECL substrate with higher sensitivity (WesternBright Quantum) or an Immun-Star WesternC kit was used. The images were captured either by film exposure or with a Bio-Rad CCD imaging system. The gray intensity was calculated using Image Lab 3.0.1 (Beta 2) software (Bio-Rad). The protocol was adapted from Peanne et al. (10.Peanne R. Legrand D. Duvet S. Mir A.M. Matthijs G. Rohrer J. Foulquier F.

Flow cytometry was performed with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur analyzer and analyzed with CellQuest Pro software. The mean fluorescence after subtracting the background using IgG reflected only the level of cell surface ICAM-1. CDG-Ib cells were cultured to 70–80% confluence, followed by the addition of 25–200 μm mannose in culture medium and incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. The PMM2 (phosphomannomutase-2) complementation was done as described by Jones et al. (9.Jones M.A. Ng B.G. Bhide S. Chin E. Rhodenizer D. He P. Losfeld M.E. He M. Raymond K. Berry G. Freeze H.H.

After six doublings, both cell lines were mixed equally, followed by membrane protein extraction, two-dimensional LC-MS/MS analysis, and data analysis. A total of 3775 quantified peptides were assigned to 1447 unique proteins in the membrane fraction. We compared the relative abundance of these membrane proteins between the two CHO cell lines by calculating the ratios of intensities of the corresponding SILAC peptide pairs (supplemental Table 1). As expected, the protein ratios clustered tightly around 1:1 (proteins with a 0.67–1.5-fold difference account for 84%), indicating that most of the membrane proteins in both cell lines are expressed at the same level. Furthermore, the majority (93%) of the 165 underrepresented (>1.5-fold) proteins are 1.5–3-fold reduced in Lec9 cells. To identify potential hypoglycosylated glycoproteins, we used a serial slimming strategy to cull the candidates as follows (Fig. 1A): 1) 165 proteins >1.5-fold underrepresented in Lec9 cells compared with Pro5 cells, 2) 62 proteins with cell surface or unknown localization by Gene Ontology annotation analysis, and 3) 18 plasma membrane proteins with NX(S/T) N-glycosylation sequons that are highlighted in supplemental Table 1. These were further narrowed to five candidates based on quality of the raw spectral data and availability of commercial antibodies. These included ICAM-1, Bst-2 (bone marrow stromal antigen 2), PMCA2 (plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 2), MRP2 (multidrug resistance protein 2), and desmoyokin. The representative raw spectra of the SILAC peptide pairs of these candidates are displayed in Fig. 1 (B–F), in which the difference in protein levels between Pro5 and Lec9 cells ranged from 1.8- to 2.5-fold. Among the list of candidates, ICAM-1 showed the largest protein expression ratio difference (2.52) calculated by three quantitative peptide pairs between Pro5 and Lec9 cells and a relative low S.D. (0.18; coefficient of variation of 7%). ICAM-1 expression was first examined by a series of biochemical experiments. ICAM-1 is a transmembrane protein with five extracellular Ig-like domains and nine occupied N-glycosylation sites in CHO cells (17.Otto V.I. Damoc E. Cueni L.N. Schürpf T. Frei R. Ali S.

It is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells and normally expressed at low levels on immune system and endothelial cells, but it is dramatically up-regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli (18.Pino M.

As shown by SILAC quantitative peptide pairs in Fig. 1B, ICAM-1 was expressed nearly 2.5-fold higher in the membrane fraction of Pro5 cells compared with Lec9 cells, which was supported by Western blotting (Fig. 2A), IF staining (Fig. 2B), and flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 2C). We also used Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. 1) to check the expression of Bst-2, PMCA2, and MRP2 in Pro5 and Lec9 cells and in several CDG patient cells, yet they were expressed only in trace amounts, making them less reliable than ICAM-1. The desmoyokin antibody was not available. Therefore, the subsequent analysis focused on ICAM-1. On the basis of the CHO cell results, we predicted that CDG patient fibroblast cell lines would have reduced ICAM-1 compared with controls. We measured ICAM-1 expression in seven controls and 31 CDG patient cell lines with proven or unknown genetic defects that produce proteins with unoccupied glycosylation sites (type I CDG). The specific genes and the number of patients analyzed are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Glycosylation genes and number of patients analyzedSampleDefectCasesControlNone7IaPMM27IbMPI4IkALG16UnknownUndefined14Total38 Open table in a new tab We first detected ICAM-1 on the cell surface by FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). Relative mean fluorescence calculation (Fig. 3E, left panel) demonstrated that ICAM-1 was underrepresented or completely absent in CDG patient fibroblasts (p = 0.0007). IF staining results are consistent with FACS data (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, membrane proteins were extracted from some CDG-Ia, CDG-Ib, and control fibroblasts, and ICAM-1 expression was analyzed by Western blotting. ICAM-1 was barely expressed in the vast majority of CDG patient fibroblasts compared with control cells (Fig. 3B), in agreement with the results of FACS analysis (Fig. 3A). Because ICAM-1 was found mainly in the membrane fraction by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) and on the fibroblast cell surface by IF staining (Fig. 3D), we reasoned that Western blot analysis of the total lysate would also reflect ICAM-1 expression at the cell surface. This was confirmed by showing that ICAM-1 expression was significantly reduced in type I CDG fibroblasts compared with control cells (p = 0.0023) (Fig. 3, C and E, right panel). Of note, two samples (Ia-107 and Ib-132) did not show reduced expression as dramatic as that seen in other CDG cells (Fig. 3C). Patient Ia-107 is a clinically very mild case and has ∼34% residual PMM2 activity. However, FACS analysis showed that ICAM-1 expression is reduced by 66% in Ia-107 (Fig. 3A) and by 35% in Ib-132 compared with the average in control fibroblasts. CDG-Ib (MPI-CDG) is caused by mutations in PMI, encoding phosphomannose isomerase, which converts Fru-6-P to Man-6-P (20.Freeze H.H. Genetic defects in the human glycome.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 537-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). CDG-Ib patients and their cells improve glycosylation when given mannose supplements by restoring Man-6-P through a complementary metabolic pathway (Fig. 4A). We supplemented CDG-Ib cells with increasing amounts of mannose (25–200 μm) for 24 h, which increased cell surface ICAM-1 expression as detected by FACS analysis (Fig. 4B) and Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Increasing mannose did not change ICAM-1 levels in control fibroblasts (data not shown), indicating that mannose therapy partially corrects ICAM-1 hypoglycosylation and allows newly synthesized, glycosylated ICAM-1 delivery to the plasma membrane. The data presented here illustrate that ICAM-1 can be used as an indicator to reflect a glycosylation therapeutic response for patient cells. CDG-Ia (PMM2-CDG) is the most prevalent CDG type and is caused by mutations in PMM2, encoding phosphomannomutase-2, which converts Man-6-P to Man-1-P. Three CDG-Ia patient fibroblast lines were infected with recombinant retroviruses expressing the wild-type PMM2 cDNA containing a FLAG tag or an empty vector. The complementation successfully corrected the PMM2 deficiency in these CDG-Ia fibroblasts as shown by a nearly 6-fold increase in PMM2 activity in the complemented cells compared with the non-complemented cells (Fig. 5A). We then examined cellular ICAM-1 expression in control cells, CDG-Ia cells, and CDG-Ia cells infected with an empty vector or a vector containing PMM2 by FACS analysis. We found an ∼2.5-fold increase in ICAM-1 in PMM2-transfected CDG-Ia cells compared with vector-transfected cells, in which the ICAM-1 level in the complemented cells reached over half of that in the control cells (Fig. 5B). Of note, ICAM-1 also increased when the empty vector was used (Fig. 5B) (21.Papi A. Johnston S.L. Rhinovirus infection induces expression of its own receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) via increased NF-κB-mediated transcription.J. Biol.

To determine whether the ICAM-1 level is positively correlated with the amount of wild-type PMM2 delivered, patient fibroblasts were gated at high and low FLAG-PMM2 levels (Fig. 5C, left panel). A >4-fold increase in ICAM-1 was observed on the surface of high level FLAG-PMM2 cells compared with the low level population, and the ICAM-1 level in the complemented cells reached nearly 70% of that in the control cells (Fig. 5C, middle and right panels). Our results clearly show that complementation with wild-type PMM2 functionally corrected PMM2 deficiency and correspondingly increased ICAM-1 expression on the cell surface. Therefore, ICAM-1 can clearly detect hypoglycosylation and show its improvement in response to gene correction. Patients with inherited glycosylation disorders have multiple glycosylation-deficient serum/plasma glycoproteins. However, there are no reliable glycosylation markers available in patient fibroblasts. As most cell surface proteins are glycosylated, they might be at risk of destruction in glycosylation-deficient cells. We hypothesized that some hypoglycosylated proteins could also fail to localize to the plasma membrane because the misfolded proteins would be degraded by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (23.Smith M.H. Ploegh H.L. Weissman J.S. Road to ruin: targeting proteins for degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum.Science. 2011; 334: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Hence, plasma membrane proteins could be considered as biomarker candidates for impaired glycosylation (24.Roth J. Protein N-glycosylation along the secretory pathway: relationship to organelle topography and function, protein quality control, and cell interactions.Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 285-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Besides the serum glycoproteins such as transferrin, some membrane-associated glycoproteins might serve as alternative indicators of a glycosylation defect (4.Marklová E. Albahri Z. Screening and diagnosis of congenital disorders of glycosylation.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2007; 385: 6-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the published data have focused mainly on the alteration of glycan structure rather than glycosylation site occupancy (25.Van Geet C. Jaeken J. Freson K. Lenaerts T. Arnout J. Vermylen J.

Protein hypoglycosylation in type I CDG patients results from the defects in synthesis or transfer of lipid-linked oligosaccharide glycan to protein. This in turn may result in protein misfolding/unfolding, degradation by the proteasome, and absence from the plasma membrane. For this reason, we selected type I CDG fibroblasts to test the expression of marker candidates. We detected reduced ICAM-1 in 29 of 31 of these type I CDG cell lines (94%) with known or undefined genetic defects that cause hypoglycosylation (Fig. 3). Two cell lines with very mild enzymatic deficiencies showed only slight (<2-fold) decreases in ICAM-1 levels. More ICAM-1 localized on the cell surface when CDG-Ib cells were supplemented with mannose (Fig. 4), indicating that ICAM-1 could be an indicator of therapeutics for improved glycosylation. PMM2 complementation in CDG-Ia cells increased ICAM-1 expression on the patient fibroblast surface (Fig. 5), supporting the utility of ICAM-1 to confirm the putative defective genes by complementation. We used systematic quantitative proteomics to establish potential hypoglycosylation markers under stringent criteria. ICAM-1 proved to be decreased on the cell surface in CDG patient fibroblasts. Mannose supplementation of CDG-Ib cells and PMM2 cDNA complementation of CDG-Ia cells partially corrected hypoglycosylation, allowing ICAM-1 to “reappear” on the plasma membrane. Our data indicate that ICAM-1 could be a useful hypoglycosylation biomarker for type I CDG cells, but we are also exploring whether ICAM-1 is decreased in type II CDG cells as well.

https://openalex.org/W2060258348,"Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), a key regulator of neuronal apoptosis, is inhibited by the phosphorylation of Ser-9/Ser-389 and was recently shown to be cleaved by calpain at the N terminus, leading to its subsequent activation. In this study calpain was found to cleave GSK-3β not only at the N terminus but also at the C terminus, and cleavage sites were identified at residues Thr-38-Thr-39 and Ile-384-Gln-385. Furthermore, the cleavage of GSK-3β occurred in tandem with Ser-9 dephosphorylation during cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis. Increasing Ser-9 phosphorylation of GSK-3β by inhibiting phosphatase 1/2A or pretreating with purified active Akt inhibited calpain-mediated cleavage of GSK-3β at both N and C termini, whereas non-phosphorylatable mutant GSK-3β S9A facilitated its cleavage. In contrast, Ser-389 phosphorylation selectively inhibited the cleavage of GSK-3β at the C terminus but not the N terminus. Calpain-mediated cleavage resulted in three truncated products, all of which contained an intact kinase domain: ΔN-GSK-3β (amino acids 39-420), ΔC-GSK-3β (amino acids 1-384), and ΔN/ΔC-GSK-3β (amino acids 39-384). All three truncated products showed increased kinase and pro-apoptotic activity, with ΔN/ΔC-GSK-3β being the most active form. This observation suggests that the GSK-3β C terminus acts as an autoinhibitory domain similar to the N terminus. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that calpain-mediated cleavage activates GSK-3β by removing its N- and C-terminal autoinhibitory domains and that Ser-9 phosphorylation inhibits the cleavage of GSK-3β at both termini. In contrast, Ser-389 phosphorylation inhibits only C-terminal cleavage but not N-terminal cleavage. These findings also identify a mechanism by which site-specific phosphorylation and calpain-mediated cleavage operate in concert to regulate GSK-3β activity."
https://openalex.org/W1615313751,"The human α-defensins (HNP) are synthesized in vivo as inactive prodefensins, and contain a conserved glycine, Gly(17), which is part of a β-bulge structure. It had previously been shown that the glycine main chain torsion angles are in a D-configuration, and that d-amino acids but not L-alanine could be substituted at that position to yield correctly folded peptides without the help of a prodomain. In this study, the glycine to L-alanine mutant defensin was synthesized in the form of a prodefensin using native chemical ligation. The ligation product folded correctly and yielded an active peptide upon CNBr cleavage. The L-Ala(17)-HNP1 crystal structure depicted a β-bulge identical to wild-type HNP1. However, dimerization was perturbed, causing one monomer to tilt with respect to the other in a dimerization model. Inhibitory activity against the anthrax lethal factor showed a 2-fold reduction relative to wild-type HNP1 as measured by the inhibitory concentration IC(50). Self-association was slightly reduced, as detected by surface plasmon resonance measurements. According to the results of the virtual colony count assay, the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus exhibited a less than 2-fold reduction in virtual lethal dose values. Prodefensins with two other L-amino acid substitutions, Arg and Phe, at the same position did not fold, indicating that only small side chains are tolerable. These results further elucidate the factors governing the region of the β-bulge structure that includes Gly(17), illuminating why glycine is conserved in all mammalian α-defensins."
https://openalex.org/W2044323939,"Although retinoids have been reported to be present and active in vertebrates and invertebrates, the presence of mechanisms for retinoid storage in the form of retinyl esters, a key feature to maintain whole-organism retinoid homeostasis, have been considered to date a vertebrate innovation. Here we demonstrate for the first time the presence of retinol and retinyl esters in an invertebrate lophotrochozoan species, the gastropod mollusk Osilinus lineatus. Furthermore, through a pharmacological approach consisting of intramuscular injections of different retinoid precursors, we also demonstrate that the retinol esterification pathway is active in vivo in this species. Interestingly, retinol and retinyl esters were only detected in males, suggesting a gender-specific role for these compounds in the testis. Females, although lacking detectable levels of retinol or retinyl esters, also have the biochemical capacity to esterify retinol, but at a lower rate than males. The occurrence of retinyl ester storage capacity, together with the presence in males and females of active retinoids, i.e., retinoic acid isomers, indicates that O. lineatus has a well developed retinoid system. Hence, the present data strongly suggest that the capacity to maintain retinoid homeostasis has arisen earlier in Bilateria evolution than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2021131453,"Fungal species exhibit diverse behaviors when presented with extracellular challenges. Pathogenic fungi can undergo cell differentiation and biofilm formation in response to fluctuating nutrient levels, and these responses are required for virulence. In the model fungal eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nutrient limitation induces filamentous growth and biofilm/mat formation. Both responses require the same signal transduction (MAPK) pathway and the same cell adhesion molecule (Flo11) but have been studied under different conditions. We found that filamentous growth and mat formation are aspects of a related response that is regulated by the MAPK pathway. Cells in yeast-form mats differentiated into pseudohyphae in response to nutrient limitation. The MAPK pathway regulated mat expansion (in the plane of the XY-axis) and substrate invasion (downward in the plane of the Z-axis), which optimized the mat's response to extracellular nutrient levels. The MAPK pathway also regulated an upward growth pattern (in the plane of the Z-axis) in response to nutrient limitation and changes in surface rigidity. Upward growth allowed for another level of mat responsiveness and resembled a type of colonial chemorepulsion. Together our results show that signaling pathways play critical roles in regulating social behaviors in which fungal cells participate. Signaling pathways may regulate similar processes in pathogens, whose highly nuanced responses are required for virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2050094103,"An aerobic bacterium capable of breaking down the pesticide acephate (O,S-dimethyl acetyl phosphoramidothioic acid) was isolated from activated sludge collected from a pesticide manufacturing facility. A phylogenetic tree based on the 16 S rRNA gene sequence determined that the isolate lies within the Pseudomonads. The isolate was able to grow in the presence of acephate at concentrations up to 80 mM, with maximum growth at 40 mM. HPLC and LC-MS/MS analysis of spent medium from growth experiments and a resting cell assay detected the accumulation of methamidophos and acetate, suggesting initial hydrolysis of the amide linkage found between these two moieties. As expected, the rapid decline in acephate was coincident with the accumulation of methamidophos. Methamidophos concentrations were maintained over a period of days, without evidence of further metabolism or cell growth by the cultures. Considering this limitation, strains such as described in this work can promote the first step of acephate mineralization in soil microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2074471879,"Calcineurin phosphatase plays crucial roles in a wide variety of cell types and organisms. Dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) family of transcriptional factors by calcineurin is essential for activating immune-responsive genes in mammals. NFAT activity is also regulated by diverse signaling pathways, which affect NFAT kinases and nuclear partner proteins. In fission yeast, calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates Prz1, a C2H2-type zinc finger transcriptional factor. Calcineurin-Prz1 signaling regulates the expression of the Pmc1 Ca2+ pump. Prz1-overexpressing cells showed extremely slow growth and high transcriptional activity of Prz1 in the absence of stimulation. Here, we isolated seven genes as dosage-dependent suppressors of this slow growth phenotype. These seven genes encode Rad24, Rad25, Pka1, Msn5 (SPAC328.01c), Pac1, Ape2, and Tfs1. All of them decreased the high transcriptional activity caused by Prz1 overexpression. Overexpression of Pka1, Rad24, and Rad25 also repressed the Ca2+-induced transcriptional activity in cells with Prz1 expressed at wild-type levels. Knock-out of rad24 or rad25 significantly enhanced the transcriptional activity of Prz1, whereas knock-out or mutation of other genes did not enhance the activity. The 14-3-3 proteins, Rad24 and Rad25, bound Prz1 and the Rad24-binding site located at residues 421–426 of Prz1. In msn5 deletion mutants, GFP-Prz1 localized at nucleus in the absence of Ca2+ stimulation, suggesting that Msn5 functions as an exportin for Prz1. In summary, our data suggest that Rad24 and Rad25 negatively regulate Prz1 and that Pka1, Msn5, Pac1, Tfs1, and Ape2 also regulate Prz1.

We have been studying calcineurin signaling pathway in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Transcriptional factor Prz1 (Ppb1-responsive zinc finger protein) is dephosphorylated and activated by calcineurin and regulates the transcription of genes involved in calcium homeostasis (15Hirayama S. Sugiura R. Lu Y. Maeda T. Kawagishi K. Yokoyama M. Tohda H. Giga-Hama Y. Shuntoh H. Kuno T. Zinc finger protein Prz1 regulates Ca2+ but not Cl− homeostasis in fission yeast.

However, other regulatory mechanisms of Prz1 are not clarified. In our previous study, we showed that overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin caused growth inhibition and aberrant cell morphology in wild-type cells but not in prz1 deletion cells (16Sio S.O. Suehiro T. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Mukai H. Kuno T. The role of the regulatory subunit of fission yeast calcineurin for in vivo activity and its relevance to FK506 sensitivity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12231-12238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the slow growth phenotype caused by overexpression of constitutively active calcineurin is mediated by Prz1. In the present study, we demonstrated that overexpression of Prz1 also caused similar slow growth phenotype. Notably, our results revealed that calcineurin itself is not necessary (and is not sufficient) to cause the defective growth. We hypothesized that hyperactivity, caused either by constitutive calcineurin or Prz1, activates perhaps multiple target gene(s) that cause this phenotype. Thus, eliminating or reducing the expression or activity of overexpressed Prz1 provides an avenue to identify regulators of Prz1 activity. Then we performed a genetic screen to isolate regulators of Prz1. As a result of the screening, we identified seven genes that encode Pka1, Rad24, Rad25, Msn5 (SPAC328.01c), Ape2, Pac1, and Tfs1 as dosage-dependent suppressors of the slow growth phenotype. The S. pombe strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. An S. pombe haploid strain in which the rad24+, rad25+, pka1+, ape2+, or tfs1+ gene had been deleted was purchased from Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea) or the Yeast Genetic Resource Center (Japan).

Proteins are denoted by roman letters, and only the first letter is capitalized (for example, Msn5). Database searches were performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST network service and the Sanger Center S. pombe database search service. The rad25+ and rad24+ genes were amplified by PCR with the genomic DNA of S. pombe as a template. For the rad25+ gene, the sense primer used PCR was 5′-GAAGATCTCATGAGTAATTCTCGTGAAAAC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GGAATTCGCGGCCGCCAGCTTTAACAGTGTCAGTCG-3′. For the rad24+ gene, the sense primer was 5′-CGGGATCCCATGTCTACTACTTCTCGTGAAG-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GGAATTCGCGGCCGCCTGCGTCCGCCTTGGGCTCAG-3′. The PCR fragment was ligated to the C terminus of GST and subcloned into the pREP1 expression vector, containing a thiamine-repressible nmt1 promoter (19Maundrell K. Thiamine-repressible expression vectors pREP and pRIP for fission yeast.Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Expression was induced by the incubation of the cells in EMM lacking thiamine. A series of truncated GFP-tagged Prz1 mutants was generated by the PCR technique. Ser-422 and Ser-424 were mutated to Ala by using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

To delete the msn5+ gene, a one-step gene disruption by homologous recombination (20Rothstein R.J. One-step gene disruption in yeast.Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar) was performed. The msn5::ura4+ disruption was constructed as follows. The cloned open reading frame of the msn5+ gene in pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene) was digested with HindIII, and the resulting fragment containing the msn5+ gene was subcloned into the HindIII site of the pBluescript vector. Then a BamHI fragment containing the ura4+ gene was inserted into the BamHI site of the previous construct, causing the interruption of the open reading frame. The fragment containing the disrupted msn5+ gene was transformed into haploid cells. Stable integrants were selected on medium lacking uracil, and disruption of the gene was checked by genomic Southern hybridization (supplemental Fig. S1). Prz1-overexpressing cells (KP1395) were transformed with an S. pombe genomic DNA library constructed in the vector pDB248. Leu+ transformants were selected on EMM plates with thiamine and then replica-plated onto EMM plates containing 5 μg/ml phloxine B red dye at 30 °C. Colonies that were able to grow on EMM plates and not stained red by phloxin B were selected. The plasmid DNA was recovered from transformants that showed plasmid-dependent rescue. These plasmids suppressed the slow growth phenotype caused by overexpression of Prz1. By DNA sequencing, the suppressing plasmids fell into six classes, which are described under “Results.” The cells were grown on EMM plates with thiamine at 30 °C for 2 days and shifted to various conditions as indicated in the figure legends. The cells were microscopically examined under an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Photographs were taken with a SPOT2 digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.). Images were processed with CorelDRAW software (Corel Corporation Inc.). For the analysis of electrophoretic mobility shift of Prz1, whole cell extracts were prepared from cultures of wild-type cells harboring pREP1-GFP-prz1+ plasmid grown at 30 °C for 24 h. Total cell lysates were prepared as follows. Approximately 2 × 107 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of NaOH lysis buffer (1.85 m NaOH, 7.5% 2-mercaptoethanol). After incubation on ice for 10 min, the proteins were precipitated by the addition of 500 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. The pellets were washed and solubilized in SDS sample buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). Protein extracts (10–20 μg/5 μl) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP or phospho-PKA substrate antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Cells expressing GFP-Prz1 from the chromosomally integrated gene were transformed with pREP1-rad24+-GST, pREP1-rad25+-GST, or pREP1-GST and were cultured at 30 °C for 24 h. Cell extract preparation and immunoblot analysis were performed as described (16Sio S.O. Suehiro T. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Mukai H. Kuno T.

The KP2888 cells (two protease-deficient strains) were transformed with pREP1-GFP-prz1+ or pREP1-rad24+-GST, and each tagged protein was expressed as described above. The cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell lysates from KP2888 cells overexpressing Rad24-GST or GST alone were incubated with a 50-μl bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. The beads were precipitated and washed three times with lysis buffer. Then lysates from the cells expressing truncated mutants of Prz1 tagged with GFP were incubated with the Rad24-GST or control GST beads. The beads were precipitated and washed five times with lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The protein were eluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblot analysis. The two protease-deficient cells expressing GST-Prz1 (KP4854) were cultured at 30 °C for 24 h in the absence of thiamine. Then the cells were treated with 0.2 m CaCl2 for 30 min. GST-Prz1 was purified from the cell lysates by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (GE Healthcare). GST-Prz1 and myelin basic protein (Sigma-Aldrich) were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in a 25-μl reaction mixture (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 250 units of cAMP-dependent kinase subunit (New England Biolabs, P6000S)) in the presence or absence of 20 μm PKI(6–22) amide (Enzo Life Science). The reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The radiolabeled proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized using autoradiography. The cells were transformed or integrated with the reporter plasmid (3×CDRE::luc(R2.2)) (21Deng L. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Suzuki M. Ebina H. Takami T. Koike A. Iba S. Kuno T.

Cell. 2006; 17: 4790-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and were untreated or treated with 0.1 m CaCl2. The CDRE transcriptional activity was measured as described previously (21Deng L.

For the experiments with overexpression of Prz1, Prz1-overexpressing cells (KP1395) were transformed with the reporter plasmid and were incubated in EMM with (Promoter OFF) or without (Promoter ON) 4 μm thiamine at 30 °C for 24 h. The cells were integrated with reporter plasmid (3×CRE::luc(R2.2)) (22Zhou X. Ma Y. Sugiura R. Kobayashi D. Suzuki M. Deng L. Kuno T.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32818-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and were treated with 0.3 m KCl. The real time monitoring assay was measured as described previously (22Zhou X. Ma Y. Sugiura R. Kobayashi D. Suzuki M. Deng L. Kuno T.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32818-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We previously reported that the overexpressed constitutively active form of calcineurin caused growth arrest and aberrant cell morphology. Furthermore, we revealed that the growth inhibition was mediated by Prz1 (16Sio S.O. Suehiro T. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Mukai H. Kuno T. The role of the regulatory subunit of fission yeast calcineurin for in vivo activity and its relevance to FK506 sensitivity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12231-12238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, we first tested whether overexpression of Prz1 also causes growth inhibition. We controlled the expression of Prz1 by using an expression vector pREP1 with nmt1 promoter. The nmt1 promoter is repressed when cells are grown in medium supplemented with thiamine and is derepressed in thiamine-free medium (19Maundrell K. Thiamine-repressible expression vectors pREP and pRIP for fission yeast.Gene. 1993; 123: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the wild-type cells harboring pREP1-GFP-prz1+ plasmid could not grow on EMM plate without thiamine, whereas the cells could grow on an EMM plate containing thiamine. Microscopic analysis revealed that Prz1-overexpressing cells showed small cell morphology (Fig. 1B). The morphology is similar to that of cells overexpressing calcineurin (16Sio S.O. Suehiro T. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Mukai H. Kuno T. The role of the regulatory subunit of fission yeast calcineurin for in vivo activity and its relevance to FK506 sensitivity.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12231-12238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We then monitored the CDRE transcriptional activity of the cells overexpressing Prz1 by 3×CDRE-fused R2.2-destabilized luciferase (3×CDRE::luc(R2.2)) (21Deng L. Sugiura R. Takeuchi M. Suzuki M. Ebina H. Takami T. Koike A. Iba S. Kuno T. Real-time monitoring of calcineurin activity in living cells. Evidence for two distinct Ca2+-dependent pathways in fission yeast.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4790-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Prz1-overexpressing cells (Promoter ON) showed an ∼10-fold increase in the basal transcriptional activity as compared with Prz1-nonoverexpressing cells (Promoter OFF) (Fig. 2A). Then we examined whether the high transcriptional activity or the growth inhibition is dependent on calcineurin. The elevated transcriptional activity caused by overexpression of Prz1 was not affected by the addition of FK506, whereas the activity was inhibited when the expression was attenuated (Fig. 2B). The growth inhibition by Prz1 overexpression was similarly observed in calcineurin knock-out cells (Fig. 2C). Collectively, overexpression of Prz1 caused calcineurin-independent high CDRE transcriptional activity and growth inhibition. To isolate genes that negatively regulate Prz1, we screened for suppressors that can rescue the slow growth phenotype caused by Prz1 overexpression. Prz1-overexpressing cells were transformed with a multicopy genomic library, and then we selected the transformants that grew better than the cells transformed with control plasmid. Twenty-three plasmids reproducibly suppressed the slow growth phenotype of the Prz1-overexpressing cells. Sequence analysis revealed that the suppressing plasmids fell into six classes: rad25+, pka1+, msn5+ (SPAC328.01c), pac1+, ape2+, and tfs1+. As shown in Fig. 3A, the overexpression of Rad25, Msn5, and Pac1 markedly suppressed the growth inhibition caused by overexpression of Prz1. The overexpression of Pka1, Ape2, and Tfs1 moderately suppressed the growth phenotype. Then we assessed whether the overexpression of the six genes can suppress the growth defect caused by a constitutive active calcineurin. The overexpression of these genes failed to suppress the growth defect (supplemental Fig. S2). Then we examined whether overexpression of these genes affects the CDRE transcriptional activity in Prz1-overexpressing cells. All of these suppressor genes, when overexpressed, repressed the transcriptional activity in Prz1-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B). Then we examined whether the aberrant morphology caused by overexpression of Prz1 was restored to normal morphology by overexpression of these genes. The cells were completely restored to normal morphology by the overexpression of Rad25 or Pac1, whereas Ape2 and Tfs1 partially suppressed the aberrant morphology. Pka1 and Msn5 caused the long and branched morphology (Fig. 4A). When Pka1 was overexpressed in wild-type cells, the cells also became elongated (Fig. 4B), indicating that this phenotype is typical for high expression of Pka1. On the other hand, the wild-type cells overexpressing Msn5 showed normal morphology (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that the phenotype caused by Msn5 overexpression is specific to Prz1-overexpressing cells. To exclude general effects on transcription, we examined the effect of the suppressor gene overexpression on the transcription mediated by Rst2, a zinc finger protein that regulates stress response element-dependent transcription (23Kunitomo H. Higuchi T. Iino Y. Yamamoto M. A zinc-finger protein, Rst2p, regulates transcription of the fission yeast ste11+ gene, which encodes a pivotal transcription factor for sexual development.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3205-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5A, the overexpression of Rst2 also caused growth inhibition, and although Rad25 and Rad24 were able to weakly suppress the slow growth phenotype, other genes failed to suppress the phenotype. Then to further exclude general effects on transcription, we examined the transcriptional activity of Atf1 (22Zhou X. Ma Y. Sugiura R. Kobayashi D. Suzuki M. Deng L. Kuno T. MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK)-dependent and -independent activation of Sty1 stress MAPK in fission yeast.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 32818-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Atf1 transcriptional factor plays a vital role in the stress response of S. pombe and is not regulated by calcineurin (22Zhou X. Ma Y. Sugiura R. Kobayashi D. Suzuki M. Deng L. Kuno T.

Chem. 2010; 285: 32818-32823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5B, only overexpression of Rad24 significantly repressed the KCl-stimulated Atf1 transcriptional activity. The 14-3-3 proteins are highly conserved in amino acid sequence from yeast to mammals. The 14-3-3 proteins are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological systems. The primary function of the 14-3-3 proteins is to bind phosphorylated proteins (24Shen Y.H. Godlewski J. Bronisz A. Zhu J. Comb M.J. Avruch J. Tzivion G. Significance of 14-3-3 self-dimerization for phosphorylation-dependent target binding.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4721-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1p and Bmh2p bind to the Snf1 (AMP-activated protein kinase)-dependent transcription factor Adr1 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (25Parua P.K. Ratnakumar S. Braun K.A. Dombek K.M. Arms E. Ryan P.M. Young E.T. 14-3-3 (Bmh) proteins inhibit transcription activation by Adr1 through direct binding to its regulatory domain.Mol. Cell.

We showed that overexpression of Rad24 also suppressed the growth phenotype and the high transcriptional activity of Prz1 overexpression (Figs. 3B and 6A). Then we examined whether Rad24 or Rad25 binds Prz1. In the GST pulldown assa"

The regulation of ENaC by molecular chaperones, such as the 70-kDa heat shock protein Hsp70, is not completely understood. Building on the previous suggestion by our group that Hsp70 promotes ENaC functional and surface expression in Xenopus oocytes, we investigated the mechanism by which Hsp70 acts upon ENaC in epithelial cells. In Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing epitope-tagged αβγ-ENaC and with tetracycline-inducible overexpression of Hsp70, treatment with 1 or 2 μg/ml doxycycline increased total Hsp70 expression ∼2-fold and ENaC functional expression ∼1.4-fold. This increase in ENaC functional expression corresponded to an increase in ENaC expression at the apical surface of the cells and was not present when an ATPase-deficient Hsp70 was similarly overexpressed. The increase in functional expression was not due to a change in the rate at which ENaC was retrieved from the apical membrane. Instead, Hsp70 overexpression increased the association of ENaC with the Sec24D cargo recognition component of coat complex II, which carries protein cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi.

https://openalex.org/W2044887367,"Escherichia coli heat shock transcription factor σ(32) is rapidly degraded by ATP-dependent proteases, such as FtsH and ClpYQ. Although the DnaK chaperone system (DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) promotes σ(32) degradation in vivo, the precise mechanism that is involved remains unknown. Our previous results indicated that σ(32) mutants containing amino acid substitution in the N-terminal half of Region 2.1 are markedly stabilized in vivo. Here, we report the further characterization of these mutants by examining purified σ(32) mutants in vitro. Surprisingly, I54A σ(32), a very stable mutant, is more susceptible to ClpYQ and FtsH proteases than wild-type σ(32), indicating that the stability of σ(32) does not always reflect its susceptibility to proteases. Co-precipitation and gel filtration analyses show that purified σ(32) mutants exhibit a reduced affinity for DnaJ, leading to a marked decrease in forming a complex with DnaK in the presence of DnaJ and ATP. Other mutants with modestly increased stability (A50S σ(32) and K51E σ(32)) show an intermediate efficiency of complex formation with DnaK, suggesting that defects in binding to DnaK and DnaJ are well correlated with metabolic stability; effective interaction with DnaK promotes σ(32) degradation in vivo. We argue that the stable and effective interaction of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) with a substrate polypeptide may generally require the simultaneous binding of heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) to distinct sites on the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2003800304,"The promoter of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) is subject to tight regulation and remains repressed in somatic cells to ensure their limited life span and to prevent tumor initiation. Here we report that the hTERT promoter is strongly repressed by p53 and the related family members p63 and p73. We found that p53-mediated repression was different in human and mouse cells and occurred through p53-dependent transcription inhibition of c-Myc or through E-box/E2F pathways, respectively. Although p63TAα-mediated repression occurred through SP1, p63TAy-mediated repression occurred through E2F signaling. Finally, p73α- and p73β-mediated repression occurred through NF-YB2. Our results show a complex multifactorial mechanism used by p53 and its family members to keep hTERT expression under tight control. The promoter of the telomerase catalytic subunit (TERT) is subject to tight regulation and remains repressed in somatic cells to ensure their limited life span and to prevent tumor initiation. Here we report that the hTERT promoter is strongly repressed by p53 and the related family members p63 and p73.

Telomeres, which form the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, help to preserve genome integrity and to prevent replicative senescence (1Cong Y.S. Wright W.E. Shay J.W.

Increased expression of wild type p53 has also been shown to repress telomerase expression in various cancer cell lines independently of its effects on growth arrest and apoptosis (28Kusumoto M.

Adenovirus-mediated p53 gene transduction inhibits telomerase activity independent of its effects on cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells.Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2140-2147PubMed Google Scholar). p53 operates as both a transcriptional activator and repressor. In response to cellular stress or DNA damage, activation of p53 expression leads to an increased expression of numerous target genes involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, and survival (29Giono L.E. Manfredi J.J. The p53 tumor suppressor participates in multiple cell cycle checkpoints.J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several studies have also established a link between transcriptionally active p53 and activation of cellular senescence programs. p53 family members p63 and p73 are produced as several isoforms by alternative splicing and can be produced as full-length proteins containing the transactivation domain (TA) and ΔN proteins missing the TA (30Moll U.M. Slade N. p63 and p73: roles in development and tumor formation.Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 371-386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to p53 knock-outs, p63 and p73 knock-outs exhibit severe developmental abnormalities but no increased cancer susceptibility. Although p63 and p73 are rarely mutated in human cancers, frequent epigenetic silencing of p73 has been reported in leukemias, lymphomas, and brain tumors (31Pei J.H. Luo S.Q. Zhong Y. Chen J.H.

In this study, we examined the mechanistic aspects of p53-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter. Our results demonstrate that, in contrast to what has been reported previously, p53-mediated repression is largely independent of SP1 binding sites in the hTERT promoter. Instead, p53-induced repression of the hTERT promoter occurs through distinct indirect transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms and is mediated by E-box and E2F pathways. We further extended our studies by investigating the role of other p53 family members, p63TAα, p63TAy, p73α, and p73β. We found that all these factors repress hTERT promoter expression. Promoter studies revealed that p63TAα-mediated repression requires SP1 because it had no effect in MEF sp1 KO cells and could no longer suppress an hTERT-luciferase reporter construct in which all SP1 binding sites had been mutated. In contrast, p63TAy-mediated repression was mediated by E2F signaling, and mutations of E2F binding sites in an hTERT-luciferase reporter construct prevented p63TAy repressive effects. Both p73α- and p73β-mediated repression was independent of SP1, E-box, or E2F sites in the hTERT promoter. We found that p73α- and p73β-mediated repression was rescued by trichostatin A (TSA) treatment. Similarly to what has been observed on the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor promoter, p73α and p73β required NF-YB2 to repress the hTERT promoter. Wild type hTERT promoter-luciferase reporter construct p330-hTERT-Luc has been described previously. E-box-mutated hTERT promoter-luciferase reporters hTERT 24/25, hTERT 24/25 1A, hTERT 24/25 1B, and hTERT 24/25 1C were provided by N. Keith (University of Glasgow) (34Glasspool R.M. Burns S.

The human HEK cell line (ATCC) was maintained in complete DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and gentamicin. For c-myc transfection experiments, 20% serum was added to prevent toxicity. MEF cell transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen) or calcium phosphate (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Cells were inoculated onto 6-well plates 1 day before transfections, and cells were harvested after 24–48 h. Assays were performed using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega) and a Berthold Junior luminometer (Oak Ridge, TN). c-myc, sp1, and p21waf siRNAs were obtained from Ambion and transfected into HEK cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). To determine telomerase activity, cells were lysed on ice in CHAPS lysis buffer and used in TRAP assays using the Trapeze Telomerase Detection kit (Chemicon) as described by the manufacturer. For real time quantitative PCR, RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), treated with DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and reverse transcribed using the RNA-to-cDNA kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was used in real time PCRs using SYBR Green Master Mix (Qiagen) using the StepOnePlus real time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). The following primers were used: hTERT (F), 5′-TGACACCTCACCTCACCCCAC-3′; hTERT (R), 5′-CACTGTCTTCCGCAAGTTCAC-3′; c-myc (F), 5′-CGTCTCCACACATCAGCACAA-3′; c-myc (R), 5′-TCTTGGCAGCAGGATAGTCCTT-3′; GAPDH (F), 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′; and GAPDH (R), 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Cells were lysed on ice in passive lysis buffer (Promega) or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Protein concentrations were quantified using the Bradford protein assay (54Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215990) Google Scholar) and run on SDS-acrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane and incubated with the following antibodies: p53 (FL-393), SP1 (5931S, Cell Signaling Technology), myc ((E10, Roche Applied Science), HA (3F10, Roche Applied Science), c-Myc (A-14), p63 (4-A4), p21WAF (C-19), and Actin (C-11). All primary and secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology unless stated otherwise. Proteins were visualized using Pierce chemiluminescent solutions. We investigated the ability of p53, p63TAα, p63TAγ, p63ΔNα, p63ΔNγ, p73α, and p73β to regulate the hTERT promoter and found that all p53 family members have strong repressive effects albeit to various extents (Fig. 1A). Repression of the hTERT promoter did not correlate with transcriptional activities as demonstrated using the reporter plasmid (pGL13-Luc) (Fig. 1B). In fact, consistent with previous results, p73α and p73β have very distinct transcriptional potentials, whereas their effect on the hTERT promoter was similar. We found no significant additive effect among p53, p63, or p73 members when used in various combinations (Fig. 1C). These results were validated in MEF p53 KO, p63 KO, and p73 KO cells to test for any cooperation requirement of different p53 family members in suppressing the hTERT promoter. Our results confirmed that p53 represses the hTERT promoter in MEF wild type, p63 KO, and p73 KO cells (Fig. 1D). Similarly, p63 and p73 did not require the presence of additional p53-related factors to exert their repressive effects on the hTERT promoter (Fig. 1, E and F). Prior studies suggest that p53 and p73β repress the hTERT promoter by forming complexes with SP1 that are recruited onto SP1 binding sites within the hTERT promoter (41Racek T. Mise N. Li Z. Stoll A. Pützer B.M. C-terminal p73 isoforms repress transcriptional activity of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter.J. Biol.

Downregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA expression by wild type p53 in human tumor cells.Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5123-5133Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). These studies relied largely on the observation that p53 and p73β had minimal effects on an hTERT-Luc reporter vector when mutation of all SP1 binding sites was introduced. The caveat to these experiments is that mutation of the SP1 sites leads to a drastic overall decrease in hTERT promoter activity close to background levels, and therefore repression by p53 or p73β from those levels can no longer be appreciated to their fullest. Indeed, in both of these studies, the authors still observed near 50% repression of the SP1-mutated hTERT promoter by either p53 or p73β despite the low luciferase levels. In general, our results do not support the involvement of SP1 binding sites in p53- or p73-mediated suppression of hTERT promoter expression. Although exogenously added SP1 may appear to prevent p53-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter (Fig. 2A), this was not specific and was explained by the 6-fold stimulation of the hTERT promoter by SP1 in the absence of p53 (Fig. 2B). In fact, we still observed a 4-fold repression of the hTERT promoter by p53 even in the presence of excess SP1 (Fig. 2B). SP3 had no significant effect on the hTERT promoter. Consistent with this observation, we found that p53, p73α, and p73β are able to repress the hTERT promoter even in the presence of a large excess of exogenously added SP1, suggesting that SP1 cannot rescue the repressive functions of either p53 or p73 (Fig. 2B). Also consistent with these results, we found that p53, p73α, and p73β are able to repress the hTERT promoter in sp1 and sp3 KO MEF cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Finally, mutations in all five SP1 binding sites in the hTERT promoter had a negligible impact on p53- or p73-mediated repression (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to the other p53 family members, p63TAα was the only one for which transcriptional repression of the hTERT promoter occurred through SP1. In support of this conclusion, p63TAα was able to repress the hTERT promoter in MEF wild type and sp3 KO cells but not in sp1 KO cells (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3B). Similarly, exogenously expressed p63TAα had no effect on an hTERT promoter-reporter with mutated SP1 binding sites (Fig. 3B). To verify that p63TAα could repress not only the exogenously added hTERT promoter but also the human endogenous hTERT promoter, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR for hTERT gene expression and found that p63TAα could repress endogenous hTERT mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). In addition, p63TAα inhibited endogenous telomerase activity as measured by TRAP assays (Fig. 3E). Finally, to confirm that p63TAα-mediated repression of endogenous hTERT expression involves SP1, we transfected HEK cells with sp1 siRNA. We found that p63TAα could no longer repress endogenous hTERT expression in sp1 knockdown cells, which was confirmed by Western blotting for SP1 expression (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that p63TAα requires SP1 for inhibition of the telomerase promoter and inhibition of hTERT mRNA expression.FIGURE 3p63TAα is unable to repress hTERT promoter mutated for SP1 binding sites.

For these experiments, site-directed mutagenesis was used to eliminate individual response sites, and following transient transfection along with p53 or related factors, luciferase activity of mutated reporter vectors was compared with the parental non-mutated vector. Our results indicate that p53-mediated repression is significantly impaired by mutation of the proximal E-box site present in the hTERT promoter as shown by higher luciferase values for hTERT 24/25 1B and hTERT 24/25 1C constructs when co-expressed with p53 (Fig. 4, A–E). In contrast to the proximal E-box, mutation of the hTERT promoter-distal E-box, hTERT 24/25 1A, had negligible effects (Fig. 4C). The repressive activity of E2F proteins is often mediated by their complexes with pRb proteins (pRb, p130, and p107) (43Dyson N. The regulation of E2F by pRB-family proteins.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). A previous study showed that p53-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter was significantly reduced in the presence of RNAi targeting pRb, p107, and p130 compared with control RNAi. However, other studies reported that p53 cannot repress the hTERT promoter in HCT116 cells despite normal levels of pRb expression. Although our data confirmed a minor role of the E2F site in p53-mediated repression (Fig. 5, A and B), this was seen only when the proximal E-box site was simultaneously mutated (Fig. 4, D and E). In the presence of the wild type E-box motif, disruption of the E2F site had negligible effects on p53-mediated repression (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest some type of cooperative effect between the distal E-box and E2F signaling in p53-mediated regulation of the hTERT promoter expression. In contrast, our data clearly showed that mutation of the E2F site (hTERT-E2FM) efficiently prevented p63TAy-mediated repression, whereas it had negligible effects on p73α- or p73β-mediated repression (Fig. 5, A and B). These results demonstrate that p63TAy-mediated repression of the hTERT promoter is completely dependent on the E2F site. These results were further confirmed using human HEK cells (Fig. 5C). Inhibition of endogenous hTERT expression and telomerase activity by p63TAγ was also seen (Fig. 5, D and E). Surprisingly, although p63TAα- and p63TAy-mediated repression mechanisms are similar in mouse and human cells, p53-mediated hTERT repression appears to use different pathways in MEF and HEK cells (Fig. 6, B and C). Although mutation of E-box and E2F sites abrogated p53-mediated repression in MEF cells, this had little effect on p53-mediated repression in human HEK cells. However, p53 was able to repress endogenous human hTERT expression (Fig. 6D) and telomerase activity (Fig. 6E). We then investigated whether p53 transcriptional activity may be required for its repressive effect. To this end, we used two transcriptionally inactive p53 mutants previously isolated from human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I-transformed adult T-cell leukemia cells (M2 and M6; Fig. 7A) (44Datta A.

The archaeal box C/D and C'/D' RNP subcomplexes are each assembled with three sRNP core proteins. The archaeal Nop56/58 core protein mediates crucial protein-protein interactions required for both sRNP assembly and the methyltransferase reaction by bridging the L7Ae and fibrillarin core proteins. The interaction of Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (Mj) Nop56/58 with the methyltransferase fibrillarin has been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis of specific amino acids in the N-terminal domain of Nop56/58 that interacts with fibrillarin. Extensive mutagenesis revealed an unusually strong Nop56/58-fibrillarin interaction. Only deletion of the NTD itself prevented dimerization with fibrillarin. The extreme stability of the Nop56/58-fibrillarin heterodimer was confirmed in both chemical and thermal denaturation analyses. However, mutations that did not affect Nop56/58 binding to fibrillarin or sRNP assembly nevertheless disrupted sRNP-guided nucleotide modification, revealing a role for Nop56/58 in methyltransferase activity. This conclusion was supported with the cross-linking of Nop56/58 to the target RNA substrate. The Mj Nop56/58 NTD was further characterized by solving its three-dimensional crystal structure to a resolution of 1.7 Å. Despite low primary sequence conservation among the archaeal Nop56/58 homologs, the overall structure of the archaeal NTD domain is very well conserved. In conclusion, the archaeal Nop56/58 NTD exhibits a conserved domain structure whose exceptionally stable interaction with fibrillarin plays a role in both RNP assembly and methyltransferase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2098420532,"Adult stem cells must balance self-renewal and differentiation for tissue homeostasis. The Drosophila ovary has provided a wealth of information about the extrinsic niche signals and intrinsic molecular processes required to ensure appropriate germline stem cell renewal and differentiation. The factors controlling behavior of the more recently identified follicle stem cells of the ovary are less well-understood but equally important for fertility. Here we report that translational regulators play a critical role in controlling these cells. Specifically, the translational regulator Caprin (Capr) is required in the follicle stem cell lineage to ensure maintenance of this stem cell population and proper encapsulation of developing germ cells by follicle stem cell progeny. In addition, reduction of one copy of the gene fmr1, encoding the translational regulator Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein, exacerbates the Capr encapsulation phenotype, suggesting Capr and fmr1 are regulating a common process. Caprin was previously characterized in vertebrates as Cytoplasmic Activation/Proliferation-Associated Protein. Significantly, we find that loss of Caprin alters the dynamics of the cell cycle, and we present evidence that misregulation of CycB contributes to the disruption in behavior of follicle stem cell progeny. Our findings support the idea that translational regulators may provide a conserved mechanism for oversight of developmentally critical cell cycles such as those in stem cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W1992493295,"In prostate cancer, genes encoding androgen-regulated, Y-chromosome-encoded, and tissue-specific antigens may all be overexpressed. In the adult male host, however, most high affinity T cells targeting these potential tumor rejection antigens will be removed during negative selection. In contrast, the female mature T-cell repertoire should contain abundant precursors capable of recognizing these classes of prostate cancer antigens and mediating effective anti-tumor immune responses.We find that syngeneic TRAMP-C2 prostatic adenocarcinoma cells are spontaneously rejected in female hosts. Adoptive transfer of naïve female lymphocytes to irradiated male hosts bearing pre-implanted TRAMP-C2 tumor cells slows tumor growth and mediates tumor rejection in some animals. The success of this adoptive transfer was dependent on the transfer of female CD4 T cells and independent of the presence of CD25-expressing regulatory T cells in the transferred lymphocytes. We identify in female CD4 T cells stimulated with TRAMP-C2 a dominant MHC II-restricted response to the Y-chromosome antigen DBY. Furthermore, CD8 T cell responses in female lymphocytes to the immunodominant MHC I-restricted antigen SPAS-1 are markedly increased compared to male mice. Finally, we find no exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease in either syngeneic or minor-antigen mismatched allogeneic lymphocyte adoptive transfer models by using female into male versus male into male cells.This study shows that adoptively transferred female lymphocytes, particularly CD4 T cells, can control the outgrowth of pre-implanted prostatic adenocarcinoma cells. This approach does not significantly worsen graft-versus-host responses suggesting it may be viable in the clinic. Further, enhancing the available immune repertoire with female-derived T cells may provide an excellent pool of prostate cancer reactive T cells for further augmentation by combination with either vaccination or immune regulatory blockade strategies."
