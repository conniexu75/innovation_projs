https://openalex.org/W2043400581,"Mitochondrial DNA from normal and cytoplasmic male-sterile maize was digested with restriction endonucleases RI from Escherichia coli or dIII from Hemophilus influenzae. Electrophoresis of resulting fragments revealed distinctions between the two cytoplasmic types. These distinctions suggest that factors responsible for cytoplasmic male sterility are located in the mitochondrial DNA, and that the mitochondrial genome is not inherited paternally."

https://openalex.org/W1982935621,"Male Tetranychus urticae search for and defend quiescent pharate females. Intruding males may be threatened or attacked. Fights involve pushing and grappling with the forelegs, jousting with the mouthparts, and entangling the opponent with silk. In these encounters larger males usually win. Sole possession of a female at her ecdysis virtually ensures successful mating."
https://openalex.org/W2064236453,"Silicified specimens of the Vendian (late Precambrian) ""index fossil"" Conophyton gaubitza from South Kazakstan contain a diverse assemblage of well-preserved cyanophytic and apparently eukaryotic algae, the first stromatolitic microbiota to be reported from the Soviet Union. Unlike the stromatolites in which they occur, the microorganisms that apparently built this form of Conophyton did not become extinct at the end of the Precambrian."

https://openalex.org/W1977992006,"The larvae of the sloth moth, Cryptoses choloepi, live in the dung of the three-toed sloth, Bradypus infuscatus. Adult female moths apparently leave the fur of the sloth to oviposit when the sloth descends, once a week, to the forest floor to defecate. Newly emerged moths fly from the dung pile into the forest canopy to find a sloth."
https://openalex.org/W2082931417,Stomata of the paracytic type have been discovered on the lower pinnule surface of the Carboniferous seed fern foliage species Alethopteris sullivanti. The stomatal complex is not visible when the cuticle is in place. This is apparently the first report of paracytic stomata in Carboniferous plants.
https://openalex.org/W2091568110,The presence of substances promoting flower induction was demonstrated in both scales and buds of Wedg-wood iris. The flower-inducing extracts of buds appear to contain gibberellin-like compounds.

https://openalex.org/W1977309525,"Migration from a nesting to a wintering ground and back again in autumn was detected each year during a 3-year study of individually identifiable Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Reverse migrants were primarily yearling, nonbreeding individuals and others of nonfamily status."
