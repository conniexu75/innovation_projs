https://openalex.org/W2041473225,"THE taxonomic position of Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of coccidioidomycosis, has been debated for some time. It is evident from the method of endosporulation exhibited both in the parasitic phase and under certain cultural conditions1,2 that the mature Coccidioides cell is a sporangium and the endospores, sporangiospores. This indicates a probable relationship with the Phycomycetes3,4 and even possibly with the sub-class, Zygomycetes5. However, certain characteristics inconsistent with such a relationship, including the development of a richly septate mycelium and the absence of definite sporangiophores, present some taxonomic difficulties. Nevertheless, as noted by Emmons5, the sporangia of many of the Zygomycetes (for example, Mortierella and Syncephalis) present so many anomalies that Coccidioides may well find a place within the group. Frey6 has shown that the Phycomycetes may be divided into two distinct groups: the one having cellulose (Oomycetes), the other having chitin (Blastocladiales and Zygomycetes) as skeletal material of their cell walls. Therefore, we thought it might be of interest to isolate and identify the non-water-soluble polysaccharide forming the skeleton of the cell wall of C. immitis."

https://openalex.org/W2003007941,"WE have already reported the partial purification from sow's milk and desiccated pig stomach of proteins which combine with cyanocobalamin and the vitamin B12-like substances having different nucleotide groups1. Purification of the protein from sow's milk whey was achieved by continuous electro-phoresis on paper2. Because of the labile nature of the protein itself, we found it easier to saturate the impure concentrate with cyanocobalamin labelled with cobalt-60 and to isolate the cyanocobalamin–protein complex. Purification of this complex by continuous electrophoresis on paper2 was followed by repeated fractionation with isopropyl alcohol at −5°. A recent preliminary note by Wijmenga, Thompson, Stern and O'Connell3, concerning a similar cyanocobalamin–protein from pig gastric mucosa, has prompted us to give a brief account of the properties of our substance isolated from sow's milk. Full experimental details will be published elsewhere."

https://openalex.org/W1996700359,"JOHNSON1 reported that DDT (dichlorodiphenyl-trichloroethane) affected the metabolism of Khapli wheat so that the seedling leaves became susceptible to a race of Puccinia graminis var. tritici to which they are normally resistant. The response to DDT was highly specific, as only one other of the resistant wheats tested (Arnautka) showed any indication of susceptibility consequent on spraying."

https://openalex.org/W4235127530,"CONSIDERABLE confusion exists in the naming of compounds of the class now most commonly referred to as ‘lipids’. It is indeed not yet agreed that the latter shall be the generic name, and the terms lipins, lipines, lipides and lipoids are in current use, together with derivative forms, galactolipins, etc., used to designate the complex members of the class. A profusion of empirical nomenclature has developed, particularly in the complex lipid field, often referring to compounds of dubious existence, and terms are frequently applied without distinction both to a single compound and to a crude ‘fraction’ containing this compound or possessing similar solubility properties. Several authors have directed attention to this state of affairs1,2, and have made proposals for rectifying some of the anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W2011367085,"SEVERAL articles have been written on the most suitable method of sharpening the knife of a microtome. The usual manner of sharpening is grinding, honing, polishing and stropping, and there are several different methods for each of those operations. There is obviously a lack of a quantitative measuring method by means of which the result of different sharpening methods can be tested. The only fairly reliable method still used is the one indicated by von Mohl1."
