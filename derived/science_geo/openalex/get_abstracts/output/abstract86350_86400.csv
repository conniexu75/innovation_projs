https://openalex.org/W1546482094,"The catalysis by iron of the formation of reactive oxygen species in biological systems has been well documented. In this present study, we have investigated the hypothesis that iron-catalyzed formation of hydroxyl radical (.OH) from superoxide anion radical (O-.2) and H2O2 requires the availability of at least one iron coordination site that is open or occupied by a readily dissociable ligand such as water. This hypothesis was tested by measuring the catalytic activity of 12 different iron chelates using hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase to generate O-.2. In these same chelates, we also determined the presence or absence of coordinated water by UV-visible spectroscopy and 1H NMR relaxation measurements. Of all chelates tested, only Fe3+ coordinated to diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), phytate, and Desferal lacked coordination water; and only these four complexes failed to produce hydroxyl radical. Separate determinations of the two redox half-reactions involved (i.e. Fe3+ + O-.2—-Fe2+ + O2 and Fe2+ + H2O2—-Fe3+ + .OH + OH-) indicate that an available coordination site is necessary for the latter (Fenton) reaction. This principle governing iron reactivity may help advance our understanding of the mechanism of oxidative damage in biological systems and may also permit the design of more effective chelators for the control of iron in biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1498034410,"Attenuation of GTP-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase by islet-activating protein (pertussis toxin) is due to the ability of the toxin to catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000/35,000-Da membrane-bound protein, which is thought to be the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase (Gi). We describe and document the purification of this protein from rabbit liver, and, in conjunction with evidence presented in the subsequent papers of the series, identify it as Gi. Purified Gi serves as an excellent substrate for islet-activating protein and can be ADP-ribosylated to the extent of 1 mol of ADP-ribose/mol of protein. The extent of ADP-ribosylation of Gi correlates with the amount of guanine nucleotide that can be bound to the protein. Studies of the nucleotide binding site on the 41,000-Da subunit of Gi reveal a high affinity site that is specific for guanine nucleotides. Rank order of affinities for various nucleotides is GTP gamma S greater than Gpp(NH)p = GTP = GDP greater than GMP much greater than App(NH)p, ATP. High affinity binding of guanine nucleotides is dependent on Mg2+ and is essentially irreversible in the presence of divalent cation. Bound nucleotide readily dissociates from its site on the 41,000-Da subunit of Gi in the absence of Mg2+. This reversal of binding is markedly enhanced by the presence of the 35,000-Da subunit of Gi. The physical characteristics of Gi are important determinants of its role as the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory component of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1504260229,"The nucleotide sequence of a rat 18 S rRNA gene was determined. The 18 S rRNA encoded in the gene contains 1874 nucleotides, and the molecular weight estimated from the sequence is 6.09 X 10(5). The sequences of rat and Xenopus laevis 18 S rRNAs are very similar; the only differences of consequence are the insertions between nucleotides 197 and 206 and between 258 and 279 of the rat nucleic acid of sequences rich in guanine and cytosine. A proposal is presented for the secondary structure of rat 18 S rRNA based on a comparison with the sequences of 17 other small ribosomal subunit RNAs. While the primary sequences of rat and eubacterial RNAs are different, the deduced secondary structures are remarkably similar."
https://openalex.org/W1511887721,"Treatment of membranes with islet activating protein (IAP), a toxin from Bordetella pertussis, results in abolition of GTP-dependent, receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This appears to result from IAP-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 41,000-Da membrane-bound protein. A protein with 41,000- and 35,000-Da subunits has been purified from rabbit liver membranes as the predominant substrate for IAP. This protein has now been shown to be capable of regulating membrane-bound adenylate cyclase activity of human platelets under various conditions. The characteristics of the actions of the IAP substrate are as follows. 1) Purified 41,000/35,000-Da dimer is capable of restoring the inhibitory effects of guanine nucleotides and the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, epinephrine, on the adenylate cyclase activity of IAP-treated membranes. 2) The subunits of the dimer dissociate in the presence of guanine nucleotide analogs or A1(3+), Mg2+, and F-. The 41,000-Da subunit has a high affinity binding site for guanine nucleotides. 3) The resolved 35,000-Da subunit of the dimer mimics guanine nucleotide- and epinephrine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase. 4) The resolved (unliganded) 41,000-Da subunit stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and relieves guanine nucleotide- +/- epinephrine-induced inhibition of the enzyme. In contrast, the GTP gamma S-bound form of the 41,000-Da subunit inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, although with lower apparent affinity than does the 35,000-Da subunit. 5) The 35,000-Da subunit increases the rate of deactivation of Gs, the stimulatory regulatory protein of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the 41,000-Da subunit can interact with Gs and inhibit its deactivation. These data strongly suggest that the IAP substrate is another dimeric, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein and that it is responsible for inhibitory modulation of adenylate cyclase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1649341288,"The inhibitory and stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory components (Gi and Gs) of adenylate cyclase both have an alpha X beta subunit structure, and the beta (35,000 Da) subunits are functionally indistinguishable. Gi and Gs both dissociate in the presence of guanine nucleotide analogs or Al3+, Mg2+, and F- in detergent-containing solutions. Several characteristics of Gi- and Gs-mediated regulation of adenylate cyclase activity have been studied in human platelet membranes. The nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) mimics GTP-dependent hormonal inhibition or stimulation of adenylate cyclase under appropriate conditions. This inhibition or stimulation follows a lag period. The combined addition of epinephrine or prostaglandin E1 with GTP gamma S results in the immediate onset of steady state inhibition or activation. The effects of the GTP analog are essentially irreversible. Fluoride is also an effective inhibitor of prostaglandin E1-stimulated adenylate cyclase, while it markedly stimulates the basal activity of the enzyme. The addition of the resolved 35,000-Da subunit of Gi to membranes results in inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and the resolved 41,000-Da subunit has a stimulatory effect on enzymatic activity. The inhibitory action of the 35,000-Da subunit is almost completely abolished in membranes that have been irreversibly inhibited by GTP gamma S plus epinephrine; this irreversible inhibition is almost completely relieved by the 41,000-Da subunit. Detergent extracts of membranes that have been treated with GTP gamma S plus epinephrine contain free 35,000-Da subunit. The 41,000-Da subunit of Gi contained in such extracts has a reduced ability to be ADP-ribosylated by islet-activating protein (IAP), which implies that this subunit is in the GTP gamma S-bound form. The irreversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase caused by GTP gamma S (plus epinephrine) in membranes is highly correlated with the liberation of free 35,000-Da subunit activity and is inversely related to the 41,000-Da IAP substrate activity in detergent extracts prepared therefrom. The increase in free 35,000-Da subunit activity in extracts and the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in GTP gamma S (plus epinephrine)-treated membranes are both markedly inhibited by treatment with IAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1573253342,"The extracellular H2O2 concentration surrounding stimulated human neutrophils was continuously quantitated with a sensitive, H2O2-detecting electrode. Following stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate, opsonized zymosan particles, or N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, the extracellular H2O2 concentration rapidly increased and maintained steady state conditions before falling to undetectable levels in a manner that was dependent on the triggering agent used. Total extracellular H2O2 accumulation for each stimulus was quantitated as the integral of the H2O2 concentration with respect to time. H2O2 accumulation in the extracellular milieu was unaffected by the addition of superoxide dismutase, whereas exogenous catalase or myeloperoxidase completely consumed the released H2O2. Analysis of H2O2 metabolism by neutrophils revealed that stimulus-dependent differences in the size of the extracellular H2O2 pool may be partially attributable to differences in hypochlorous acid generation by the H2O2, myeloperoxidase, chloride system. Finally, both the concentration of H2O2 in the extracellular space and its utilization by myeloperoxidase could be diminished in the presence of an extracellular target cell. These data indicate that the ability of a triggering agent to stimulate the neutrophil to generate H2O2 and release myeloperoxidase, coupled with the characteristics of a target cell population, control H2O2 metabolism in effector-target cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1517224738,"We have purified the Rieske iron-sulfur protein from Thermus thermophilus. Chemical analyses show that the protein contains iron, labile sulfide, and cysteine in equimolar concentrations, four of each for Mr approximately 20,000. The oxidized and reduced form of the protein have been characterized by optical, EPR, CD, magnetic CD and Mossbauer spectroscopies. Our data suggest the presence of a unique iron-sulfur center. Mossbauer studies of the oxidized and reduced protein demonstrate unambiguously that the protein contains clusters with [2Fe-2S] cores. The iron analyses and the Mossbauer data, taken together, suggest that the protein has two [2Fe-2S] clusters. This is supported by the observation that two electrons are required for complete reduction of the protein and that the g = 1.94-type signal of the reduced protein has a spin concentration of one spin (S = 1/2) per 2Fe. Within the excellent resolution of the Mossbauer and EPR data, the two clusters are identical. Our results thus suggest that each [2Fe-2S] cluster is coordinated by at most two cysteine residues. The Mossbauer spectra of the reduced protein were analyzed with an S = 1/2 spin Hamiltonian. The hyperfine parameters obtained are very similar to those reported for putidaredoxin. The main difference is that the Rieske protein exhibits an increased isomer shift at the Fe2+ site, suggesting that non-cysteine ligands are coordinated to the site that becomes reduced to Fe2+ upon reduction. A comparison of our data with those reported for various NADH-dependent dioxygenases suggest that these enzymes contain a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] center."
https://openalex.org/W2035434814,"We have transfected monkey CV-1 cells with non-infectious, linear SV40 DNA, lacking the 72 by repeat enhancer region. Infectious virus was recovered from this “enhancer trap” upon cotransfection with enhancer DNA segments from various viruses, notably a truncated polyoma enhancer that was integrated as a dimer. Cotransfection of the “enhancer trap” with fragmented DNA of mouse, monkey, or human origin yielded no recombinant virus with integrated cellular sequences, with one possible exception. In some transfection experiments without added viral enhancer DNA, SV40 variants were generated that have a segment of their flanking “late” DNA duplicated to substitute for the deleted 72 by repeat. In one variant, an 88 by duplication creates a strong enhancer from this nonenhancing DNA region. Both the polyoma enhancer fragment and the spontaneously created enhancers lack the alternating purines-pyrimidines or “CACA box” suggested to be characteristic for enhancer elements and show only limited homology to the “GTGG()G box.”"
https://openalex.org/W1921613987,"Muscarinic receptor stimulation elicits two distinct biochemical responses in embryonic chick heart cells: inhibition of catecholamine-stimulated cyclic AMP formation and stimulation of phosphoinositide (PhI) hydrolysis. We observe two major differences in the effects of agonists on these responses. First, carbachol and oxotremorine both inhibit cyclic AMP formation, but only carbachol stimulates PhI hydrolysis. Second, the dose-response relationships for the cyclic AMP and PhI responses differ; the half-maximal concentrations of carbachol needed to inhibit cAMP accumulation and stimulate PhI hydrolysis are 2 X 10(-7) and 2 X 10(-5) M, respectively. We carried out radioligand binding studies on intact chick heart cells to determine whether these data could be explained in terms of different agonist binding states of the muscarinic receptor. In intact cells, carbachol competes for [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate-binding sites with high and low affinity, while oxotremorine shows only high affinity binding. We suggest that the receptor state common to both agonists is the state associated with inhibition of adenylate cyclase, while the very low affinity binding site seen only with carbachol is associated with the PhI response. We also consider the possibility that both responses are caused by a single receptor state that is efficiently coupled to adenylate cyclase inhibition and inefficiently coupled to PhI hydrolysis. Whichever mechanism is correct, our findings demonstrate that muscarinic receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase and the PhI response can be differentiated by virtue of their sensitivity to agonist and the efficiency with which some agonists induce receptor change and elicit receptor-mediated biochemical responses."
https://openalex.org/W1603280106,"Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) possesses a multi-component methane monooxygenase which catalyzes in vivo the conversion of methane to methanol. Component A of this enzyme system, believed to be the oxygenase component, has been purified to near homogeneity (95%). The native protein has a molecular weight of approximately 210,000 and is comprised of three subunits of Mr = 54,000, 42,000, and 17,000, which appear to be present in stoichiometric amounts suggesting an alpha 2, beta 2, gamma 2 arrangement in the native protein. Purified preparations of the protein are virtually colorless and examination of the uv/visible absorption spectrum revealed a peak around 280-290 nm and thereafter a steady decrease in absorbance to longer wavelengths. The ESR spectrum of the oxidized protein gave a signal at g = 4.3, presumably due to rhombic iron, and a radical signal at g = 2.01. Upon reduction with dithionite, a signal at g = 1.934 appeared. Chemical analyses of our purified preparations revealed the presence of iron (2.3 mol/mol) and zinc (0.2-0.5 mol/mol): molybdenum, copper, nickel, heme, and acid-labile sulfur were all virtually absent. On ultra thin layer isoelectric focusing, purified component A was judged to have a pI between 5.0 and 5.1. Extracts prepared from a variety of other methanotrophs failed to show any cross-reaction to antibody raised against M. capsulatus component A."
https://openalex.org/W1479854695,"We demonstrate that the activity of the major DNA topoisomerase I from calf thymus is severely inhibited after modification by purified poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase. Polymeric chains of poly(ADP-ribose) are covalently attached to DNA topoisomerase I. These observations with highly purified enzymes suggest that poly(ADP-ribosylation) may be a cellular mechanism for modulating DNA topoisomerase I activity in response to the state of DNA in the nucleus. Although extensive poly(ADP-ribosylation) of the Mr = 100,000 DNA topoisomerase I from calf thymus resulted in greater than 90% enzyme inhibition, exogenous poly(ADP-ribose) does not, by itself, inhibit topoisomerase activity. After modification, the apparent molecular weight of both the topoisomerase enzyme protein and of the topoisomerase enzyme activity was increased. In vitro, the extent of modification of DNA topoisomerase I could be controlled either by changing the ratio of topoisomerase to the synthetase or by varying the reaction time. More than 40 residues of ADP ribose per topoisomerase molecule could be added by the synthetase. Analysis of a poly(ADP-ribosylated) topoisomerase preparation that was about 50% inhibited revealed an average polymer chain length of 7.4, with 1-2 chains per enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1540660343,"Hemin, in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and oxygen, catalyzes the selective degradation of heme-binding proteins to small peptide fragments. Among the proteins examined, the heme-binding protein of rabbit serum (HBP-93) proved to be unusually sensitive. Myoglobin also exhibited considerable sensitivity whereas hemopexin and bovine serum albumin were only slightly susceptible to this degradative action of hemin. The reaction with HBP-93 depended upon coordination of the protein with hemin, was optimal at pH 6.5 and increased 4-fold as the temperature was elevated from 10 to 60 degrees C. The requirement for both oxygen and the reducing agent, 2-mercaptoethanol, and the partial protection of HBP-93 to degradation by catalase, superoxide dismutase, mannitol, and thiourea suggest the involvement of reduced oxygen species in the reaction. A possible role for the heme-mediated degradation of proteins in cell differentiation and other biological responses is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2005021967,"The 15;12 translocations in murine plasmacytomas represent recombination of the myc oncogene with the immunoglobulin CH locus, often within CH switch recombination (SH) regions. Chromosome junctions cloned from four plasmacytomas confirmed that the translocation generates reciprocal CHSH-myc and 5'myc-SH structures. H locus targets included S alpha fused to Smu, Smu fused to S gamma 2b, and a germline S alpha region. The nature of two H locus targets suggests that the target need not be highly active transcriptionally. Switch recombination machinery is implicated in the translocation by the SH targets and by homology of certain c-myc breakpoints with normal switch recombination sites. Fusion regions revealed deletions, extraneous nucleotides, and one duplication. These results prompt a translocation model in which staggered single-stranded breaks on each chromosome are followed by single-strand excision or polymerization prior to ligation to the other chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1993802920,"The chromatin structure of regulatory regions of the extrachromosomal rRNA genes of Tetrahymena thermophila was probed by nuclease treatment of isolated nuclei. The chromatin near the origins of replication contains hypersensitive sites for micrococcal nuclease, DNAase I, and DNAase II. These sites persist in starved cells, consistent with the origins' being maintained in an altered chromatin structure independent of DNA replication. The region between the two origins of replication is organized into a phased array of seven nucleosomes, the fourth of which is centered at the axis of symmetry of the palindromic rDNA. The entire transcribed region and 150 by upstream from the initiation site are generally accessible to nucleases; any histone proteins associated with these regions are clearly not in a highly organized nucleosomal array as seen in the central region. Comparison of the chromatin structures of the central spacer of T. thermophila and T. pyriformis rDNA reveals that deletion or insertion of DNA has occurred in increments of 200 bp. This is taken to imply that there are constraints on the evolution of spacer DNA sequences at the level of the nucleosome."
https://openalex.org/W1564731863,"The calcium-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (C kinase) and its proteolytic product (M kinase), originally discovered in central nervous tissue (Takai, Y., Kishimoto, A., Inoue, M., and Nishizuka, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 7603-7610) were characterized in bovine adrenal cortex cytosol. An endogenous calcium-dependent protease able to generate M kinase from the isolated C kinase in vitro was also present in adrenocortical extracts. Bovine adrenocortical cells in suspension as well as in primary culture contain the C and the M kinase activities. Treatment of these cells by steroidogenic concentrations (nM to microM) of ACTH resulted in a time and dose-dependent increase of cytosolic C kinase activity, whereas no change in M kinase activity was detected. This apparent activation appears to result mostly from an intracellular shift of the membrane-associated C kinase to a soluble cytosolic form of the enzyme. These observations open the question of the possible implication of the calcium, phospholipid-dependent protein phosphorylation system in hormone-dependent cellular regulatory processes."
https://openalex.org/W1590908262,"Properties of Ca2+ transport activated by depolarization of the membrane potential were investigated in the GH4C1 strain of rat pituitary cells. Membrane potential was depolarized by increasing external K+ concentration and was determined by [3H]tetraphenylphosphonium+ distribution. Depolarization by 50 mM [K+]o increased the initial rate of 45Ca2+ uptake 5-fold and the steady state 45Ca2+ content 8-fold. Stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin (2 X 10(-6) M), and was insensitive to external Na+ concentration. Stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake increased with increasing external Ca2+ concentration (for [Ca2+]o less than 10 mM) and could be described by a Langmuir type expression (KCa = 4.3 mM). Initial rates of 45Ca2+ uptake increased almost linearly between -51 and -30 mV, from 2 to 12 nmol/min/mg of protein, and a maximum of 14 nmol/min/mg of protein was reached at -12 mV beyond which 45Ca2+ influx decreased, and was 11 nmol/min/mg of protein at 0 mV. Ca2+ permeability, PCa, calculated from the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz constant field expression increased almost linearly for a wide range of membrane potential (-51 to -20 mV) and began to level off at -6 mV. Activated 45Ca2+ uptake was completely inhibited by La3+, Co2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, nifedipine, and verapamil; K1/2 values for inhibition were 1.7 X 10(-7) M, 0.1 mM, 0.1 mM, 2 mM, 1.7 X 10(-8) M, and 2 X 10(-5) M, respectively, at 0.5 mM [Ca2+]o. Ba2+ could substitute for Ca2+ in the uptake mechanism. The increase in activated 45Ca2+ uptake was transient and was turned off with time. We conclude that the initial rate of K+-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake measured under the experimental conditions described represents uptake via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Knowledge of the properties of this channel in GH4C1 cells will be essential in elucidating its role in the Ca2+-dependent actions of thyrotropin-releasing hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1552886290,"Some strains of Streptococcus pyogenes isolated from infected human tissues were shown to bind laminin, a major component of basement membranes. Binding of 125I-laminin to bacteria was time dependent and functionally irreversible. Of several unlabeled proteins tested in competition experiments, laminin and fibrinogen inhibited binding of the radiolabeled protein. The inhibitory effect exerted by fibrinogen was apparently not caused by a binding to the laminin receptors. The number of receptors available for laminin on cells of the strain examined ranged from 0 to 10(3) depending on the media used to grow the bacteria and an apparent KD of 4 X 10(-8)M was calculated for the reaction. Bacterial cells incubated with proteolytic enzymes lose the ability to bind laminin, and a trypsin digest contained active receptors capable of competing with intact cells for 125I-laminin. Active receptors may be adsorbed on a column of laminin-Sepharose but not on Sepharose gels substituted with fibrinogen or fibronectin. After radiolabeling the proteins in the trypsin digest a laminin-binding 125I-labeled protein (Mr greater than 10(6] was isolated by affinity chromatography from a receptor positive strain. Similar components could not be isolated from a strain apparently lacking laminin receptors. Therefore, this protein was tentatively identified as a laminin receptor of streptococci."
https://openalex.org/W1519314712,"Abstract Two separable structural domains were identified in the Escherichia coli dnaB protein (Mr = 52,000) by partial proteolytic cleavage under nondenaturing conditions. The hydrolysis of dnaB protein by trypsin proceeded in two distinct stages in the presence of ATP or ADP. In the first stage, 14 amino acid residues at the NH2-terminal end were removed and dnaB protein was converted into a fragment with a molecular weight of 50,000 (Fragment I). Fragment I retained about 60% of the original activity in priming DNA replication and was fully active in DNA-dependent ATPase activity. In the second stage, Fragment I was further cleaved into two separable polypeptides with molecular weights of 33,000 (Fragment II) and 12,000 (Fragment III), respectively. Fragment II, as a hexamer, retained DNA-dependent ATPase activity comparable to the intact protein but was totally inactive in priming DNA replication. No known activity of dnaB protein was detected in Fragment III alone. NH2 termini of Fragments I and III and COOH termini of dnaB protein and Fragment II were identical indicating that Fragments III and II were located at the NH2 and COOH termini of Fragment I, respectively. These results indicate that dnaB protein is composed of at least two distinct domains. 1) Fragment III, the rigid domain, is essential for protein interaction, i.e. association with dnaC protein and primase in priming DNA replication in the primosome. 2) A 14-amino acid residue fragment, at the NH2-terminal end adjacent to Fragment III, probably required to stabilize the protein interaction involved in priming DNA replication. 3) Fragment II, the flexible COOH-terminal domain, contains the active sites for DNA binding, ATP binding, and protein oligomerization. Fragment II is cleaved by trypsin at many sites in the absence of ATP or ADP ligands. The rate of conversion of Fragment I into the yield of Fragments II and III was decreased approximately by 2 orders of magnitude by changing the ligand from ADP to the nonhydrolyzed ATP analog, adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate). These results indicate that the conformation of the COOH-terminal domain in the dnaB protein is stabilized by ATP or ADP. Such a nucleotide-induced conformational change was also demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Moreover, the data suggest that the conformation of the dnaB protein complexed with adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) is different from that complexed with ADP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2007869476,"The v-erbB gene of avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) codes for an integral plasma membrane glycoprotein, gp74erbB. Expression of gp74erbB and its intracellular precursors, gp66erbB and gp68erbB, has been studied in cells transformed by two temperature-sensitive mutants of AEV. After shift to 42 degrees C, the processing of gp68erbB is blocked in tsAEV-transformed, but not in wtAEV-transformed, erythroblasts and fibroblasts. In addition, gp74erbB disappears from the surface of tsAEV cells within 12 hr after shift. Thus tsAEV mutants probably bear a lesion in v-erbB that affects the maturation and subcellular localization of gp74erbB. The tsAEV erythroblasts, when ""committed"" to differentiation by a pulse-shift to 42 degrees C, reexpress gp74erbB during terminal differentiation at 36 degrees C. This suggests that tsAEV erythroblasts become insensitive to the transforming functions of gp74erbB at a certain stage of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1505070492,"Depolarization of membrane potential by high external K+ activates Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels in GH4C1 cells (Tan, K.-N., and Tashjian, A. H., Jr. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 418-426). The involvement of this channel in thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) action on prolactin (PRL) release was assessed by comparing the pharmacological characteristics of TRH-induced PRL release with PRL release due to high K+. Two components of TRH-stimulated PRL release were detected. The major component (approximately equal to 75%) was dependent on external Ca2+ concentration and was inhibited by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers in a manner quantitatively similar to high K+-stimulated PRL release. The minor component (approximately equal to 25%) of TRH-stimulated PRL release was insensitive to voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers and could occur in the presence of low external Ca2+ (10(-5)-10(-7) M). Neither voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blockers nor depletion of medium Ca2+ prevented the action of TRH on mobilizing cell-associated 45Ca2+ from GH4C1 cells. Divalent cations that permeate voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (Sr2+ and Ba2+) substituted for Ca2+ in supporting high K+- and TRH-stimulated PRL release while Mg2+, a nonpermeant cation, did not. We conclude that TRH stimulates PRL release by increasing [Ca2+]i through at least two mechanisms: one requires only low [Ca2+]o, the second involves Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. This latter mechanism accounts for approximately equal to 75% of maximum TRH-induced PRL release."
https://openalex.org/W1485654343,"The relationship of intracellular pH to extracellular pH has been measured in suspensions of isolated hepatocytes at 25 degrees C. The internal pH was found to be a linear function of external pH and it changed by 0.45 pH unit per 1.0 unit change in external pH. The internal [H+] was equal to the external [H+] at approximately pH 7.1. Gluconeogenesis, urea synthesis, and oxidative phosphorylation showed different dependencies on the intracellular pH. Gluconeogenesis was the most sensitive to changes in [H+] and it declined by 80% when the intracellular pH decreased from 7.1 to 6.9. Urea synthesis was less pH-dependent, decreasing by about 30% for the same change in the intracellular [H+] whereas respiratory rate showed very little dependence on pH at this temperature. Intracellular [ATP]/[ADP] decreased linearly from 8.5 to 1.5 as the intracellular pH increased from 6.8 to 7.6, while intracellular [Pi] was essentially constant at 3.2 nmol/mg of cells, wet weight. Cytochrome c became more reduced with increasing intracellular pH, from less than 10% at pH 6.8 to 35% at pH 7.7. The calculated free energy of hydrolysis of ATP was nearly independent of pH as was the free energy of electron transfer from the intramitochondrial NAD couple (calculated from the [acetoacetate]/[3-OH-butyrate] ratio) to cytochrome c."
https://openalex.org/W1528644098,"Abstract Utilizing the induced differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells as a model of myeloid maturation, we examined the development of the superoxide-generating system, focusing on NADPH oxidase activity, membrane depolarization, and cytochrome b content. NADPH oxidase activity, measured as NADPH-dependent superoxide production, increased with both spontaneous and N,N-dimethylformamide-induced differentiation. Activity in particulate fractions from induced HL-60 cells and human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes was proportional to their relative rates of superoxide production, but activity from uninduced cells was surprisingly high: one-third that from induced cells, despite only 7% their rate of superoxide generation. NADPH oxidase activities in phagocytic vesicles from induced HL-60 cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were equal, indicating the equivalence of the enzyme system in active portions of their cell membranes. Separation by centrifugal elutriation of the HL-60 cell population into fractions of varying maturity confirmed the relationship of NADPH oxidase activity to advancing differentiation in both dimethylformamide-induced and spontaneously maturing cells. Membrane potential change, an early event related to activation of the oxidase, was followed by 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine dye fluorescence. The depolarization response increased dramatically in both magnitude and initial rate of change during differentiation. The cells' cytochrome b content increased 3-fold with induction of differentiation, in proportion to the change in NADPH oxidase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1488705224,"The mRNA activity coding for rat liver glucokinase was measured in vivo under different hormonal and nutritional conditions. Starvation resulted in minimal levels of glucokinase mRNA activity. Glucose refeeding caused a 4-fold induction of glucokinase mRNA within 48 h, which followed similar alterations in enzyme activity. Minimal values for glucokinase mRNA were also measured in diabetic animals fed glucose and were significantly elevated by insulin injection within 1.5 h. Administration of dibutyryl cyclic AMP to glucose-fed rats caused a rapid loss of the specific mRNA. The half-life of glucokinase mRNA, determined after the administration of cordycepin to glucose-fed animals, was approximately 40 min. This half-life was unaffected by the administration of dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Glucokinase mRNA was reduced 60% in glucose-fed adrenalectomized or thyroidectomized rats. The activity of the glucokinase mRNA agreed well with the measured rates of enzyme synthesis. These data indicate that insulin regulates hepatic glucokinase synthesis in vivo by increasing glucokinase mRNA; its effect is reduced by the absence of glucocorticoids or thyroid hormones and is rapidly antagonized by cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W1545663938,"Abstract Fructose-6-P,2-kinase:fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase has been purified to homogeneity. The ratio of the activities of fructose-6-P,2-kinase to fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase is 1.2. The enzyme (native) contains 0.2 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit, and it is fully phosphorylated to 0.96 mol of phosphate/mol of subunit by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Kinetic behavior of the native and phosphorylated forms of these enzymes was investigated. Both native and phosphofructose-6-P,2-kinase show sigmoidal kinetics with respect to fructose-6-P with an apparent K0.5 of 15 microM and 50 microM, respectively. The Hill coefficients are also increased from 1.3 to 2 by phosphorylation. The initial velocity patterns with respect to ATP follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics but the K0.5 of the phosphoenzyme (0.5 mM) is higher than that of the native enzyme (0.25 mM). The native fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase shows a biphasic saturation curve with respect to fructose-2,6-P2 which appears to be negatively cooperative. The phosphofructose 2,6-bisphosphatase, however, exhibits no cooperativity, and the apparent K0.5 for the substrate is 0.5 microM. Both forms of the phosphatase show the same Vmax. Based on these results possible allosteric regulation of fructose-6-P, 2-kinase and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase in a reciprocal manner in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537586850,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of the dnaB gene and the primary structure of the dnaB protein of Escherichia coli (Arai, K., Yasuda, S., and Kornberg, A. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 5247-5252). The coding region for the dnaB protein is 1413 base pairs followed by double stop codons and preceded by a possible promoter sequence. The dnaB gene lacks a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence. The primary structure deduced from the DNA sequence is consistent with the protein chemical data. The dnaB protein contains 470 amino acid residues and has a calculated molecular weight of 52,265. In the mature protein, the initiator methionine residue is removed in vivo leaving alanine as the NH2-terminal residue. Based on the amino acid sequence, we predict that the dnaB protein may be composed of two domains. A hydrophilic NH2-terminal region (residues 1-20) is followed by a compact domain and a possible hinge region (residues 21-172) consisting primarily of alpha-helix. The sites of facile tryptic cleavage are at the arginine residues at 14 and 171. The DNA-dependent ATPase domain (residues 172-470) is located at the COOH-terminal end of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1502658707,"Sequences of two large tRNA gene clusters (trrnD and trrnE) in Bacillus subtilis 168 revealed 16 and 21 tRNA genes, respectively, as identified by anticodon assignments. Each cluster contains upstream flanking 23 and 5 S rRNA sequences. The 23-5 S intergenic space in trrnE corresponds exactly to the analogous space in trrnB, which was previously sequenced (Wawrousek, E.F., and Hansen, J.N. (1983) J.Biol. Chem. 258, 291-298). The 5 S rRNA genes in trrnB and trrnE are B. subtilis major species; but trrnD possesses a minor species (Raue, H.A., and Planta, R. J. (1977) Mol. Gen. Genet. 156, 185-193) gene with a putative promoter that may allow differential expression with respect to the upstream rRNA gene set. Most of the tRNA genes are probably expressed as large transcriptional units, except for a LeuTTG tRNA in the trrnD cluster that appears to constitute its own operon with putative promoter and terminator sequences. Although all the amino acids are represented among the tRNA anticodons, there are few repeats of amino acid types within clusters; trrnD with 16 tRNA genes has anticodons corresponding to 15 amino acids. About two-thirds of the tRNA genes encode a 3'-terminal-CCA, and these are intermingled with those that do not, with no apparent pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1541878833,The question of the stoichiometry of copper bound to dopamine beta-hydroxylase and the number of copper atoms required for maximal activity was addressed in this study. Incubation of tetrameric enzyme from bovine adrenal medulla with 64Cu2+ followed by rapid gel filtration yielded an enzyme containing 8.3-8.9 mol of Cu/mol of tetramer. An identical stoichiometry was obtained by analysis of bound copper by atomic absorption methods. NMR and EPR were used to monitor titrations of the enzyme with Cu2+ and showed that the longitudinal relaxation rate of solvent water protons and the amplitude of the signal at g approximately 2 increased linearly up to a copper to protein ratio of approximately 8. Additional titrations also indicate that an enzyme-Cu2+-tyramine-CN- inhibitory complex was formed when 8 mol of Cu2+ are bound per mol of enzyme. The rate of inactivation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase by the mechanism-based inhibitor 2-Br-3-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propene was measured and used as a method to follow enzymatic catalysis. An increase in rate was observed with increasing Cu2+ up to a protein to Cu2+ ratio of 8 Cu/tetramer. The rate becomes constant after this ratio is achieved. These data indicate that dopamine beta-hydroxylase specifically binds 8 mol of Cu/tetramer and that this stoichiometry is required for maximal activity.
https://openalex.org/W1601136427,"Abstract The ESR-spin approach has been employed to detect and characterize o-semiquinone radicals from the oxidation of epinephrine and related materials (norepinephrine, 3,4-dihydroxynorephedrine, isoproterenol, and adrenalone) in aqueous solutions. Semiquinones were generated by various oxidative procedures--enzymatic oxidation (with horseradish peroxidase/H2O2), chemical oxidation (with Ag2O) and photooxidation--and subsequently kinetically stabilized through complexation with Zn2+ ions. This spin stabilization affords high radical concentrations, which has allowed unambiguous identification of the radical intermediates. Where appropriate, spectral assignments have been supported by deuterium substitution experiments and computer simulations of spectra. Two types of free radical have been identified: primary open chain semiquinones, formed by one-electron oxidation of the parent catecholamines, and secondary semiquinones, formed subsequent to cyclization reactions. The mechanism of formation of the secondary radicals is discussed, and it is concluded that they are derived from product aminochromes. Thus, oxidation of adrenochrome gives a radical identical to the secondary species observed from oxidation of epinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W2052572940,"Plasmids that replicate autonomously in Chlamydomonas reinhardii were constructed by inserting random DNA fragments from this alga into a plasmid containing the yeast ARG4 locus. Arginine prototrophy was used as a selective marker. The presence of free plasmids in the DNA of the transformants was demonstrated by hybridization with a specific plasmid probe and by recovering these plasmids in E. coli after transformation. Four of them were characterized. Their inserts of 415, 257, 153, and 102 bp all hybridize to chloroplast DNA and were localized on the physical map of the chloroplast genome. One of these plasmids also promotes autonomous replication in yeast. Sequence analysis of the inserts of the plasmids reveals several short direct and inverted repeats and two semiconserved AT-rich elements of 19 and 12 bp that may play a role in promoting autonomous replication in C. reinhardii."
https://openalex.org/W1516969398,"Abstract Yeast LEU1 encodes the second enzyme in leucine biosynthesis. A 3.5-kilobase pair (kb) yeast genomic DNA fragment which complements a leu1 auxotroph was isolated by yeast transformation. After recloning into an integrating vector, a subfragment (of the 3.5-kb fragment) directs a URA3 marker to integrate at the LEU1 locus. About 1.9 kb was sequenced from the 5'-end of the 3.5-kb insert, and a long open reading frame and potential ATG start codon were located. S1 nuclease mapping showed a major start for LEU1 transcripts at 79 nucleotides upstream of the ATG codon. Northern blots with a LEU1-specific probe showed the size of the LEU1 transcript (about 2.9 kb) is consistent with the size of the enzyme and steady state levels of the transcript are sharply reduced in cells grown in the presence of an elevated leucine concentration. The latter observation correlates with the repression by leucine of LEU1 gene product levels. Other work has shown that the level of the LEU2 gene product is also repressed by leucine. Sequence comparisons between LEU1 and LEU2 show that the LEU2 5'-sequences which are cognate to leucine are not found in LEU1; and three blocks of nucleotide sequence homology between LEU1 and LEU2 occur in the 330 nucleotides upstream of the respective start codons."
https://openalex.org/W1601863160,"We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of two early embryonic beta-globin genes of the BALB/c mouse: beta h0 and beta h1 X beta h1 codes for the embryonic z protein, while the beta h0 gene may be a minor early embryonic beta-globin gene. The general sequence organization of both genes is entirely analogous to other functional globin genes. There is, however, a 220-base pair insertion of unique sequence within the first intron of beta h0 X beta h0 and beta h1 are 96% homologous for 260 base pairs 5‘ to the AUG initiation codon, and 93% homologous throughout their coding regions. Analysis of the 5‘-flanking sequence demonstrates that these genes are more nonadult-like than adult-like. The sequences show evidence for gene conversions among the mouse nonadult beta-globin genes that were limited to individual exons, presumably by the presence of non-homologous introns. We propose that this arrangement has the beneficial evolutionary effect of allowing gene conversion to act independently on regions of the protein with different structural or functional responsibilities. beta h0 and beta h1 are evolutionary homologs to the human fetal and rabbit beta 3 genes, while their manner of expression is similar to rabbit beta 3 and dissimilar to human fetal expression. The evolutionary history of the human beta-globin genes, therefore, includes the recruitment of an embryonic gene to fetal developmental control."
https://openalex.org/W1563931720,"Binding of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) to specific receptors on membranes isolated from GH4C1 pituitary cells was inhibited by monovalent cations and guanyl nucleotides. NaCl and LiCl inhibited TRH binding by 70%, with half-maximal inhibition at 30 mM; RbCl and KCl inhibited only 10% at concentrations up to 150 mM. NaCl decreased both the apparent number and the affinity of TRH receptors and increased the rate of dissociation of TRH from both membrane and Triton X-100-solubilized receptors. Guanyl nucleotides inhibited TRH binding up to 80%, with guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) approximately GTP much greater than GDP approximately ATP greater than GMP. GTP and Gpp(NH)p exerted half-maximal effects at 0.3 microM and decreased receptor affinity to one-third of control but did not change receptor number. Gpp(NH)p accelerated the dissociation of TRH from membranes but not from solubilized receptors. The effects of NaCl were independent of temperature, while GTP and Gpp(NH)p were much more inhibitory at 22 degrees C (70%) than at 0 degrees C (10%). Inhibition by NaCl could be reversed by washing the membranes, and inhibition by GTP was reversed if membranes were chilled to 0 degrees C. The inhibitory effects of low concentrations of NaCl and Gpp(NH)p were additive. Neither monovalent cations nor GTP prevented the TRH-receptor complex from undergoing transformation from a state with rapid dissociation kinetics to a slower dissociating form. The results suggest that sodium ion regulates TRH binding by interacting with a site on the receptor, while guanyl nucleotides regulate TRH binding indirectly."
https://openalex.org/W1524152021,"The concentration of uridine in the media of cultured L1210 cells was maintained within the concentration range found in plasma (1 to 10 microM) to determine if such concentrations are sufficient to satisfy the pyrimidine requirements of a population of dividing cells and to determine if cells utilize de novo and/or salvage pathways when exposed to plasma concentrations of uridine. When cells were incubated in the presence of N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartate to block de novo biosynthesis, plasma concentrations of uridine maintained normal cell growth. De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, as determined by [14C]sodium bicarbonate incorporation into uracil nucleotides, was affected by the low concentrations of uridine found in the plasma. Below 1 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was not affected; between 3 and 5 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by approximately 50%; and above 12 microM uridine, de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by greater than 95%. Inhibition of de novo biosynthesis correlated with an increase in the uracil nucleotide pool. The de novo pathway was much more sensitive to the uracil nucleotide pool size than was the salvage pathway, such that when de novo biosynthesis was inhibited by greater than 95% the uracil nucleotide pool continued to expand and the cells continued to take up [14C]uridine. Thus, the pyrimidine requirements of cultured L1210 cells can be met by concentrations of uridine found in the plasma and, when exposed to such physiologic concentrations, L1210 cells decrease their dependency on de novo biosynthesis and utilize their salvage pathway. Circulating uridine, therefore, may be of physiologic importance and could be an important determinant in anti-pyrimidine chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W1523270301,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase of the cellular slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, is developmentally regulated; there is an approximately 4-fold increase in activity during development. The incorporation of [3H]leucine into the enzyme demonstrates that there is de novo synthesis of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The activities of the catalytic and regulatory subunits increase in parallel. The maximal rate of increase of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity precedes tip formation, a stage of development characterized by a sharp increase in mRNA complexity. The high level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, attained at this stage of development, persists when aggregates are dispersed and the amoebae are kept in suspension without added cAMP. The synthesis of the developmentally regulated mRNAs under these conditions is dependent on exogenous cAMP. The increase in cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity during development does not require sustained cell-cell contact insofar as it occurs in single cell suspensions of amoebae. Furthermore, the increase does not require exogenous cAMP, although added cAMP stimulates the synthesis of the enzyme to a level higher than that found, when cAMP is not added. These observations support the hypothesis that in D. discoideum cAMP-dependent protein kinase mediates the effects of cAMP on development."

https://openalex.org/W1577736439,"A scheme is proposed for the regulation of stromal sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase activity which enlarges upon a previously elaborated mechanism (Woodrow, I.E., and Walker, D.A. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 722, 508-516). The latter involves oxidized (inactive) and reduced (active) enzyme forms. Both the free enzymes and the enzyme-substrate complexes undergo slow oxidation/reduction. This study examines the behavior of the system under pH and Mg2+ concentration regimes that are likely to occur in the chloroplast stroma. The control of enzyme activity by pH can be described in terms of each free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex existing in protonated and nonprotonated forms. The molecular dissociation constants for each protonation reaction were calculated from kinetic data. Mg2+ concentration changes modulate these constants. Under conditions that are likely to obtain in the stroma in the dark, the model predicts that approximately 99.1% of the enzyme will be in the inactive forms. Such inactivation is important since it would prevent the reductive pentose phosphate pathway from operating in darkness."
https://openalex.org/W1607323359,"Ribosomes prepared from murine lymphosarcoma cells were phosphorylated by a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase designated H4P kinase. H4P kinase was isolated as an inactive enzyme which was activated by Mg2+-ATP and an endogenous converting enzyme. In the absence of preactivation by Mg2+-ATP and an endogenous converting enzyme, H4P kinase catalyzed phosphorylation of 80, 60, and 40 S ribosomal subunits at a low rate. After activation, the H4P kinase selectively catalyzed phosphorylation of the S 6 protein in the 40 S ribosomal subunit. Under the assay conditions selected, at least 90% of the [32P]phosphate transferred to the 40 S ribosomal preparation was incorporated into S 6. The apparent Km for 40 S subunits phosphorylated by H4P kinase was 7.2 microM. The calculated Vmax was 50 nmol of Pi transferred per min/mg. Exhaustive phosphorylation of 40 S subunits resulted in incorporation of 3 mol of phosphate/mol of S 6, in contrast to results reported previously which indicated 0.3 mol of phosphate was transferred by a similar enzyme from reticulocyte (Del Grande, R. W., and Traugh, J. A. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 123, 421-428). These data are consistent with a potential role for H4P kinase in the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of S 6 at multiple sites."
https://openalex.org/W1539831244,"NAD kinase activity from dark grown corn coleoptiles is shown to be almost totally dependent on Ca2+ and calmodulin. Nearly all of the enzyme activity is found in a particulate fraction. Upon differential and density gradient centrifugation the NAD kinase activity co-migrates with the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase whereas marker activities for nuclei, etioplasts, endoplasmic reticulum, and microbodies could well be separated, indicating that the NAD kinase is associated with mitochondria. This NAD kinase, associated with intact mitochondria, can be activated by exogenously added Ca2+ and calmodulin. In order to investigate the submitochondrial localization of the NAD kinase, the organelles were ruptured by osmotic treatment and sonication and the submitochondrial fractions were separated by density gradient centrifugation. The NAD kinase activity exhibits the same density pattern as the antimycin A-insensitive NADH-dependent cytochrome c reductase, a marker enzyme of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Marker enzymes for the mitochondrial matrix and the inner mitochondrial membrane reveal different density profiles. These results indicate that the Ca2+, calmodulin-dependent NAD kinase from coleoptiles of dark grown corn seedlings is located at the outer mitochondrial membrane. The physiological relevance of the location and the Ca2+, calmodulin-dependence of the NAD kinase will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2033013773,"Cells transformed by Polyoma virus (Py) can undergo a high rate of excision or amplification of integrated viral DNA sequences, and these phenomena require the presence of homology (i.e., repeats) within the viral insertion as well as a functional viral large T antigen (T-Ag). To determine whether the main role of large T-Ag in excision and amplification was replicative or recombination-promoting, we studied transformed rat cell lines containing tandem insertions of a ts-a Py molecule (encoding a thermolabile large T-Ag) with a deletion of the origin of viral DNA replication. Culturing of these cells at the temperature permissive for large T-Ag function did not result in any detectable excision or amplification of integrated Py sequences. We then introduced into origin-defective lines a recombinant plasmid containing the viral origin of replication and the gene coding for resistance to the antibiotic G418. All G418-resistant clones analyzed readily amplified the integrated plasmid molecules when grown under conditions permissive for large T-Ag function, showing that these cells produced viral large T-Ag capable of promoting amplification in trans of DNA sequences containing the Py origin. These observations strongly suggest that Polyoma large T antigen promotes excision or amplification of viral DNA by initiating replication at the integrated origin, providing a favorable substrate for subsequent recombination."
https://openalex.org/W1586112062,"The effects of 10(-10) to 10(-7) M glucagon on cAMP, phosphorylase a, cell calcium, and glucose production, and glucagon interactions with epinephrine were studied in isolated hepatocytes from adult male and female rats. At physiological concentrations (10(-10) - 10(-9) M), glucagon activated phosphorylase by increasing cAMP and not by raising the cytosolic free calcium. At supra-physiologic concentrations (and in the male only), glucagon slightly increased the cytosolic free calcium, the fractional efflux of calcium, and, after 2 h, decreased the cell calcium content. Exposure of hepatocytes to the simultaneous administration of 10(-9) M glucagon and 10(-7) M epinephrine resulted in a prolongation of the activation of phosphorylase a and a greater release of glucose from glycogen stores than exposure to either agonist alone. In the male, the effects of low concentrations of the two hormones on phosphorylase a activity were additive. Cytosolic free calcium was increased by 10(-6) M epinephrine from 280 to 500 nM while physiological concentrations of glucagon did not change it. In these intact cells, there was no evidence of an alpha 2-adrenergic inhibition of adenyl cyclase and no indication that cAMP depresses the rise in cell calcium induced by alpha-adrenergic stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2149487887,"Precursor to ADP/ATP carrier synthesized in vitro is transferred into isolated mitochondria to a protease-resistant location. This process requires an electrical potential across the inner membrane. We show now that precursor imported in a cell-free system exhibits the same resistance to protease as the mature endogenous carrier. Furthermore, transferred protein, but not receptor-associated precursor, binds carboxy-atractyloside, a specific inhibitor of the mature carrier and can be isolated by the purification procedure for the mature carrier. At least 70% of the precursor associated with mitochondria in the presence of a membrane potential acquires this functional characteristic. Finally, the binding of carboxyatractyloside can be modulated by treatment of the imported protein with sulfhydryl reagents in a manner indistinguishable from the authentic carrier protein. We conclude that import in vitro leads to correct assembly and orientation of the ADP/ATP carrier in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1567709725,"Enzymatic cleavage of sialic acid from human blood clotting factor IX results in a loss of factor IX clotting activity. The loss of clotting activity and the rate of release of sialic acid follow the same time courses. Control experiments have ruled out several explanations for the loss of factor IX activity: proteolytic degradation, inhibitory effects of free sialic acid, and non-specific inhibition of the clotting assays. Furthermore, no inhibition was seen when similar enzymatic cleavage was carried out on factor X and factor VIII. Therefore, we suggest that the loss of factor IX activity is the direct result of cleavage of sialic acid from the protein. Most of the inhibition appeared to be an effect on the activity of factor IXa itself, and thus far, little or no effect has been shown on the activation of factor IX to IXa. The structural basis for this unusual effect of sialic acid on protein function currently is being investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1604388739,"The amphibian photoreceptor rod outer segment contains a guanine nucleotide-binding complex which consists of a 39,000-dalton polypeptide that binds guanine nucleotides (G protein), a 36,000-dalton polypeptide (H protein), and an approximately 6,500-dalton polypeptide. Sensitivity to trypsin proteolysis was utilized as a probe of structure-function relationships for these polypeptides. Digestion of the H protein generated fragments of 26,000 and 15,000 daltons whose proteolytic susceptibility was not altered by guanosine triphosphates, light, or membranes. The approximately 6,500-dalton polypeptide was not trypsin sensitive. When the G protein was eluted from illuminated membranes by GTP, trypsin proteolysis cleaved a terminal 1,000-dalton fragment (G1) to yield a 38,000-dalton fragment (G38). With increased digestion time, a 6,000-dalton fragment (G6) was removed from G38 to yield a 32,000-dalton fragment (G32). G32 was subsequently digested to fragments of 23,000 and 12,000 daltons. However, when the G protein was eluted from illuminated membranes by hydrolysis-resistant analogues of GTP, G32 was protected from further digestion. This is consistent with a GTP-induced conformational change in the G protein which is altered by GTP hydrolysis. Proteolysis of the G protein after covalent labeling with a photoaffinity analogue of GTP demonstrated that the analogue is bound to first G38 and then G32, indicating the GTP-binding site is associated with G32. Fragment G6 was cleaved when the G protein was soluble or bound to unilluminated membranes. However, when bound to illuminated membranes, fragments were generated reflecting the loss of 7,500, 9,000, or 11,000 daltons from the G protein. This light-induced alteration in proteolytic susceptibility indicates there is a light-induced conformational change in the G protein. Fragment G1 was not removed from the G protein when it was membrane bound, suggesting G1 is involved in binding to a membrane structure. These data suggest that the light-induced binding of the G protein to illuminated membranes and the reversal of this binding by GTP are mediated through conformational changes in the G protein and that three conformations exist: 1) a basal, inactive conformation; 2) a primed conformation induced by binding to photolyzed rhodopsin, with a high affinity for GTP; and 3) an active conformation, induced by binding of GTP, which activates the catalytic complex of light-activated phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1547045442,"Abstract HeLa cells were made strictly dependent upon polyamine by growth in the presence of alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. Under these conditions, the specific activity of the cellular polyamine pools eventually equilibrated to that of exogenously supplied [14C]putrescine; however, the process was very slow, requiring half-equilibration times of about 16 h for spermidine and 28 for spermine. Thus, the distribution of radioactivity in individual polyamines became a valid measure of polyamine content only after a continuous 4-day incorporation period. When propagated in polyamine-labeled cells, two picornaviruses were found to incorporate substantially different amounts of polyamine: about 0.6% of the cell pool for human rhinovirus 14 but only 0.04% for poliovirus. This content of polyamine was sufficient to neutralize nearly 27% of the negative charge of the RNA in human rhinovirus 14 but only 1.6% in poliovirus."

Analogs of cAMP, but not cGMP, also enhanced phosphorylation of HMG 14. The sites of phosphorylation were analyzed by partial acid hydrolysis and by two-dimensional mapping of tryptic digests of 32P-labeled HMG 14 which was purified from control and TSH-treated thyroid tissue. TSH treatment enhanced phosphorylation at serine residues in four prominent tryptic phosphopeptides which were identical with those derived from HMG 14 phosphorylated in vitro with cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The four tryptic phosphopeptides contain serine 6, the major site of in vitro phosphorylation catalyzed by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases (Walton, G. M., Spiess, J., and Gill, G. N. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 4661-4668). TSH did not affect phosphorylation of serine 24, a minor site of phosphorylation in vitro. These studies suggest that TSH-stimulated phosphorylation of HMG 14 is catalyzed by cAMP-dependent protein kinase."

The cross-linking reagent interfered with the activation of NADPH oxidase, but not with its activity. Cells treated with succinimidyl butyrate, a monovalent analog of the cross-linkers, underwent a normal respiratory burst. Cross-linking also inhibited degranulation, phagocytosis, and fluorescence responses of potential-sensitive dyes but had little effect on lactate production, sugar transport, the binding of fMet-Leu-Phe, or the activity of various enzymes in the cross-linked neutrophils. Most of the cellular functions inhibited through the reaction of neutrophils with the cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) could be restored by reduction of the disulfide bonds of the cell-bound cross-linker with dithiothreitol."

Both enzymes display broad substrate specificities but have distinct enzymatic properties in regard to their susceptibility to heat-stable protein inhibitor-2 and their response to divalent cations. Monoclonal antibodies against both protein phosphatase C-I and C-II were produced by fusion of spleen cells of immunized BALB/c mice with SP2/0-Ag14 mouse myeloma cells. The products of the hybrid cells were screened by solid phase radioimmunoassay for the production of antibodies to protein phosphatase C-I and C-II. Positive cells were cloned and injected into mice to produce ascitic fluids. Ten monoclonal antibodies against phosphatase C-I and eight monoclonal antibodies against phosphatase C-II were obtained. These antibodies were characterized with regard to their relative binding affinities to the two protein phosphatases and their abilities to inhibit the phosphorylase phosphatase activities of the two enzymes. All ten of the phosphatase C-I monoclonal antibodies inhibited the phosphorylase phosphatase activity of phosphatase C-I, and three of these also inhibited phosphatase C-II. Only one of the eight antibodies to phosphatase C-II was inhibitory and inhibited the activities of both phosphatase C-I and C-II. Examination of the binding of these monoclonal antibodies by a solid phase radioimmunoassay showed that eight of the ten phosphatase C-I antibodies cross-reacted with phosphatase C-II, while all eight of the phosphatase C-II antibodies cross-reacted with phosphatase C-I. These findings show that phosphatases C-I and C-II possess common antigenic determinant(s) and may, therefore, be structurally related proteins."

Limited proteolysis in the COOH-terminal region of the molecule with chymotrypsin, trypsin, or both sequentially, led us to establish that the phosphorylation sites are located at Ser residues 341 and 356. The in vitro phosphorylation of purified rat liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase results in modification at both residues, although the major site of phosphorylation (61%) is at Ser-341. In contrast, rat liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase purified from animals that had been injected with [32P] phosphate contains most of the label (81%) at Ser-356."

Nevertheless, the sulfhydryl group appears to be proximal to these sites and not a functional component of either. Modification of pig kidney fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase with three reagents, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), iodoacetamide, and phenacyl bromide, yields derivatives with similar properties, thus suggesting that the same residue was modified in each case. The modified enzymes exhibited: (a) higher Vmax when Mn2+ was used as the activating cation; (b) decreased activity in the presence of nonsaturating Mg2+ concentrations; (c) no change in sensitivity toward AMP inhibition. Automated Edman degradation of a tryptic peptide containing radioactive carboxamidomethylcysteine showed the sequence of residues Gly-111-Arg-140 of pig kidney fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. The modified residue was shown to be cysteine-128, and the same cysteine residue was alkylated when the enzyme was reacted with phenacyl bromide. Cysteine-128 is also present in rat and sheep liver fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and a long stretch of the sequence around this reactive cysteine residue is highly conserved."
https://openalex.org/W2133561711,"Restriction mapping of the globin genes from a homozygous delta beta thalassemia patient from Israel indicates that at least a 10-kilobase deletion is present extending 3' from within the large intervening sequence (IVS 2) of the delta globin gene and including the entire beta globin gene. Unique bands are seen when cellular DNA from this patient is digested with a variety of restriction endonucleases and hybridized with a probe specific for the delta IVS 2. Extensive analysis of the Israeli delta beta thalassemia DNA as well as material from an Italian delta beta thalassemia homozygote with enzymes which cleave more frequently in delta IVS 2 has localized the 5' end of the deletion to a 107-base pair region within delta IVS 2. This region contains a unique repetitive sequence (TG)4 which has been reported to be a specific recognition signal for recombination and may be involved in the formation of these mutant genes. Two homozygous delta(0) thalassemia DNA samples from Japan were also analyzed for gene rearrangements or other changes by restriction enzyme mapping. No changes from normal were seen using 14 different enzymes indicating the absence of large deletions in the region around the delta globin gene. More specifically, both the 5' and 3' splice junctions of the IVS 2 appear to be normal from hybridization of restriction fragments generated by HphI and AluI, respectively, with a delta IVS 2 specific probe. We have also shown that point mutations which could lead to termination codons are not present at codons 35, 37, 43, 61, and 121, since restriction enzymes which recognize these sites produce normal patterns. The delta(0) thalassemia phenotype in these two subjects is most likely due to a point mutation either at one of the other 24 potential termination codons not accessible to restriction analysis or to other single nucleotide changes which could either decrease delta globin gene transcription or lead to abnormal processing or transport of delta globin mRNA."
