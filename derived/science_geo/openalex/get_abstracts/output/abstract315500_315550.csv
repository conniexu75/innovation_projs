https://openalex.org/W2052185634,"Studies of ecosystem processes on the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico suggest that longterm grazing of semiarid grasslands leads to an increase in the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water, nitrogen, and other soil resources. Heterogeneity of soil resources promotes invasion by desert shrubs, which leads to a further localization of soil resources under shrub canopies. In the barren area between shrubs, soil fertility is lost by erosion and gaseous emissions. This positive feedback leads to the desertification of formerly productive land in southern New Mexico and in other regions, such as the Sahel. Future desertification is likely to be exacerbated by global climate warming and to cause significant changes in global biogeochemical cycles."
https://openalex.org/W2005193213,"Spawning of green sea urchins and blue mussels may be triggered by a heat-stable metabolite released by various species of phytoplankton. Mussels require a higher phytoplankton density for a maximum response than urchins, perhaps because mussels are exposed to higher concentrations of phytoplankton as a result of their filtering activity. Phytoplankton as a spawning cue appears to integrate numerous physical and biotic factors indicating favorable conditions for larval growth and survival. Evolution of similar direct coupling of the larval phase with phytoplankton blooms may be common among marine invertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2059983182,Ceramics are a distinct class of materials whose properties range from extreme hardness to unique electrical behavior. New methods of creating thin films of complex oxides and electronic ceramics allow the integration of these properties with semiconductor technology and raise the possibility of a new range of electronic devices.
https://openalex.org/W2073208997,"The kinetics of photoinduced electron-transfer (ET) reactions have been measured in a series of synthetic donor-acceptor complexes. The electron donors are singlet or triplet excited iridium(I) dimers (Ir2), and the acceptors are N-alkylpyridinium groups covalently bound to phosphinite ligands on the Ir2 core. Rate constants for excited-state ET range from 3.5 × 106 to 1.1 × 1011 per second, and thermal back ET (pyridinium radical to Ir2+) rates vary from 2.0 × 1010 to 6.7 × 107 per second. The variation of these rates with driving force is in remarkably good agreement with the Marcus theory prediction of a Gaussian free-energy dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2068308515,"The hexagonal, pole-centered cloud feature in Saturn's northern atmosphere, as revealed in Voyager close-encounter imaging mosaics, may be interpreted as a stationary Rossby wave. The wave is embedded within a sharply peaked eastward jet (of 100 meters per second) and appears to be perturbed by at least one anticyclonic oval vortex immediately to the south. The effectively exact observational determination of the horizontal wave number and phase speed, applied to a simple model dispersion relation, suggests that the wave is vertically trapped and provides a diagnostic template for further modeling of the deep atmospheric stratification."
https://openalex.org/W2011536869,"Stable carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C values) can be used to evaluate an animal's source of nutritional carbon. Most animals with chemoautotrophic endosymbionts have quite negative tissue delta(13)C values due to discrimination against (13)C associated with chemoautotrophic assimilation of inorganic carbon. However, the delta(13)C values of hydrothermal vent (HTV) vestimentiferans are significantly higher than the values reported for non-HTV vestimentiferans or other invertebrates with chemoautotrophic endosymbionts. Tissue delta(13)C values of two species of HTV vestimentiferans increase with increasing size of the animals. This relation supports the hypothesis that the relatively high delta(13)C values are the result of inorganic carbon limitation during carbon fixation. A more favorable relation between gas exchange and carbon fixation in the smaller individuals is expected, due to differences in the geometric scaling of gas-exchange surfaces and trophosome volume."
https://openalex.org/W1981438434,"The recently discovered periodic comet Machholz 1986 VIII (1986e) travels closer to the sun than any known planet and any known comet with an orbital period of less than 150 years, thus providing astronomers with a unique object for studying cometary evolution. The comet is spiraling steadily closer to the sun, from perihelion distance q [unknown] 0.9 astronomical unit at about A.D. 700 to q [unknown] 0.13 at present (orbital period, 5.25 years), to an expected q [unknown] 0.03 by about 2450; should the comet survive such increasingly close perihelion passages, q will begin steadily to increase shortly thereafter. A review of observations made since discovery is presented, together with a discussion of numerical investigations of the comet's orbit over 4000 years and prospects for observing the upcoming return to perihelion in 1991."
https://openalex.org/W1963896601,"Compact regions in the Milky Way, such as accreting degenerate binary stars, may be sites of acceleration of particles with energies far greater than produced at any man-made accelerator, present or proposed. If so, they would emit characteristic neutral radiation of ultra-high energy, which might be strong enough to be detectable at Earth. The quest for these faint but energetic signals is the focus of more than 50 large, ground-based experiments that are looking for high energy photons or neutrinos from point sources in our galaxy and beyond. Several sources have been claimed, but the signals appear to have unexpected and puzzling features that must be clarified before the field can settle into a routine phase of systematic investigation. In the meantime, the potentially profound implications for particle physics, as well as astrophysics, make this field one of intense activity."

https://openalex.org/W2339867255,"during the Middle Ages. Yet, despite this continuity the Renaissance represented something entirely new. It represented a phase change in the human experience which is evident in the art, science, and technology of the period. Individuals such as: Michelangelo Buonarrotti (1474-1564), Raphael (Raffelo Sanzio, 1483-1520), Andrea Verrocchio (1432-1488), Filippo Brunelleschi (1377-1446), Leon Battista Alberti (14041472), and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) became known as “Renaissance Men.” This is because these individuals, and many like them, excelled in all aspects of human understanding including art, science, and technology. In no other time have these three areas of the human experience been so obviously intertwined, and interdependent. The following discussion explores some of the relationships between art, science, and technology in the Renaissance."
