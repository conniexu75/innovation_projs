https://openalex.org/W3100300163,"Background Since the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of medical students, medical faculties have faced the challenge of adapting instruction to digital platforms. Although medical students are willing to support pandemic response efforts, how the crisis will affect their medical training remains uncertain. Thus, in this study, we investigated the teaching- and learning-related stressors and expectations of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional survey was distributed online to undergraduate medical students at medical faculties in Germany. Students answered questions about COVID-19 and teaching (on a 7-point Likert scale from 0 (“not at all”) to 6 (“completely”)) and completed mental well-being measurements, including the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Perceived Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Descriptive data analysis, a t -test and Pearson correlations were performed to process the data. Results Medical students felt well-informed about COVID-19 in general ( M = 5.64, SD = 1.28) and in the medical context ( M = 5.14, SD = 1.34) but significantly less informed about the pandemic in the academic context, M = 2.47, SD = 1.49, t (371) = 31.98, p &lt; .001. Their distress levels were high (STAI: M = 45.12, SD = 4.73) and significantly correlated with the academic context ( r p = .164, p &lt; .01) but not their private lives. Concerning how they were taught, they most often expected online lectures (91.7%) and live broadcasts (67.2%) and less often expected innovative digital teaching strategies, including serious games (17.3%) and virtual-reality exercises (16.7%). Discussion Medical students seem to be aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for academic and healthcare contexts. They also seem to think that their teachers will enhance their digital competencies during the pandemic. Therefore, faculties of medicine need to rapidly and adequately digitalise their approaches to teaching."

https://openalex.org/W3104737224,"The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 began in December 2019 and rapidly became a pandemic. The present study investigated the significance of lymphopenia on disease severity. A total of 115 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from a tertiary hospital in Changsha, China, were enrolled. Clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome data were gathered and compared between patients with and without lymphopenia. The median age was 42 years (1–75). Fifty-four patients (47.0%) of the 115 patients had lymphopenia on admission. More patients in the lymphopenia group had hypertension (30.8% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.006) and coronary heart disease (3.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.029) than in the nonlymphopenia group, and more patients with leukopenia (48.1% vs 14.8%, P&lt;0.001) and eosinopenia (92.6% vs 54.1%, P&lt;0.001) were observed. Lymphopenia was also correlated with severity grades of pneumonia (P&lt;0.001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level (P = 0.0014). Lymphopenia was associated with a prolonged duration of hospitalization (17.0 days vs. 14.0 days, P = 0.002). Lymphocyte recovery appeared the earliest, prior to CRP and chest radiographs, in severe cases, which suggests its predictive value for disease improvement. Our results demonstrated the clinical significance of lymphopenia for predicting the severity of and recovery from COVID-19, which emphasizes the need to dynamically monitor lymphocyte count."
https://openalex.org/W3103203821,"Due to the challenges for developing vaccines in devastating pandemic situations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), developing and screening of novel antiviral agents are peremptorily demanded. Herein, we developed EGYVIR as a potent immunomodulatory herbal extract with promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. It constitutes of a combination of black pepper extract with curcumin extract. The antiviral effect of EGYVIR extract is attributed to the two key phases of the disease in severe cases. First, the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-kβ p50, attenuating the SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated cytokine storm. Additionally, the EGYVIR extract has an in vitro virucidal effect for SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro study of EGYVIR extract against SARS-CoV-2 on Huh-7 cell lines, revealed the potential role of NF-kβ/TNFα/IL-6 during the infection process. EGYVIR antagonizes the NF-kβ pathway in-silico and in-vitro studies. Consequently, it has the potential to hinder the release of IL-6 and TNFα, decreasing the production of essential cytokines storm elements."
https://openalex.org/W3100120625,"Chronic tinnitus is a debilitating condition which affects 10–20% of adults and can severely impact their quality of life. Currently there is no objective measure of tinnitus that can be used clinically. Clinical assessment of the condition uses subjective feedback from individuals which is not always reliable. We investigated the sensitivity of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to differentiate individuals with and without tinnitus and to identify fNIRS features associated with subjective ratings of tinnitus severity. We recorded fNIRS signals in the resting state and in response to auditory or visual stimuli from 25 individuals with chronic tinnitus and 21 controls matched for age and hearing loss. Severity of tinnitus was rated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory and subjective ratings of tinnitus loudness and annoyance were measured on a visual analogue scale. Following statistical group comparisons, machine learning methods including feature extraction and classification were applied to the fNIRS features to classify patients with tinnitus and controls and differentiate tinnitus at different severity levels. Resting state measures of connectivity between temporal regions and frontal and occipital regions were significantly higher in patients with tinnitus compared to controls. In the tinnitus group, temporal-occipital connectivity showed a significant increase with subject ratings of loudness. Also in this group, both visual and auditory evoked responses were significantly reduced in the visual and auditory regions of interest respectively. Naïve Bayes classifiers were able to classify patients with tinnitus from controls with an accuracy of 78.3%. An accuracy of 87.32% was achieved using Neural Networks to differentiate patients with slight/ mild versus moderate/ severe tinnitus. Our findings show the feasibility of using fNIRS and machine learning to develop an objective measure of tinnitus. Such a measure would greatly benefit clinicians and patients by providing a tool to objectively assess new treatments and patients’ treatment progress."

https://openalex.org/W3024319245,"We provide nationally representative estimates of sexual minority representation in STEM fields by studying 142,641 men and women in same-sex couples from the 2009–2018 American Community Surveys. These data indicate that men in same-sex couples are 12 percentage points less likely to have completed a bachelor’s degree in a STEM field compared to men in different-sex couples. On the other hand, there is no gap observed for women in same-sex couples compared to women in different-sex couples. The STEM degree gap between men in same-sex and different-sex couples is larger than the STEM degree gap between all white and black men but is smaller than the gender gap in STEM degrees. We also document a smaller but statistically significant gap in STEM occupations between men in same-sex and different-sex couples, and we replicate this finding by comparing heterosexual and gay men using independently drawn data from the 2013–2018 National Health Interview Surveys. These differences persist after controlling for demographic characteristics, location, and fertility. Finally, we document that gay male representation in STEM fields (measured using either degrees or occupations) is systematically and positively associated with female representation in those same STEM fields."
https://openalex.org/W3103768833,"Objectives The primary aim was to estimate the burnout prevalence among all medical students at the Medical School of the University of Cyprus. Secondary aims were to ascertain the predictors of burnout and its relationship with lifestyle habits, sleep quality and mental health. Background Burnout in the healthcare sector has drawn significant scientific attention over the last few years. Recent research underscored the large burden of profession-related burnout among medical students. Materials and methods An anonymous questionnaire was administered to all 189 eligible candidates. This included demographic and lifestyle characteristics. Sleep quality was assessed via the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index, mental health was assessed via the mental health (MH) domain of the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and burnout with the Maslach Burnout Inventory–Student Survey (MBI-SS). Results Overall response rate was 96.3%. The burnout prevalence was 18.1%. There was a significant linear effect of between the year of studies and the burnout frequency [F(1) = 5.09, p = 0.024], implying that with increasing academic year there were more students with burnout, especially after the 4th year of education which signifies the beginning of clinical education. Students with burnout were more likely to have poor sleep quality (90.9% vs. 60.8%, odds ratio 4.33, p = 0.023) and worse mental health (MH score 40.2 ± 17.7 vs 62.9 ± 20.3, p&lt;0.001). Alcohol consumers had more symptoms of cynicism and less feelings of efficacy than non-alcohol consumers. Moreover, less feelings of efficacy were significantly associated with more alcohol consumption among alcohol consumers. Conclusions Burnout is prevalent in medical students and increases significantly during the clinical years. Students with burnout have worse sleep and mental health and might use alcohol as a coping mechanism. Implementing prevention strategies of burnout may be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W3103126297,"Objectives To examine the potential moderating effects of explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes on the relationship between percent of Black county residents and COVID-19 cases and deaths. Methods We collected data from a variety of publicly available sources for 817 counties in the US. (26% of all counties). Cumulative COVID-19 deaths and cases from January 22 to August 31, 2020 were the dependent variables; explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes served as the moderators; subjective poor or fair health, food insecurity, percent uninsured, percent unemployed, median family income, percent women, percent of Asian county resident, percent of Hispanic county residents, and percent of people 65 or older were controls. Results The percent of Black county residents was positively associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county level. The relationship between percent of Black residents and COVID-19 cases was moderated by explicit racial attitudes and implicit racial attitudes. Conclusions Implicit racial attitudes can take on a shared property at the community level and effectively explain racial disparities. COVID-19 cases are highest when both the percent of Black county residents and implicit racial attitudes are high."
https://openalex.org/W3105206001,"During the state of alarm declared in Spain by COVID-19 due to the pandemic, the country's authorities declared Social Services and their workers to be essential, considering that the activity of these professionals with the vulnerable population was crucial and that services should continue to be provided to guarantee the well-being of users in this exceptionally serious situation. This article analyzes the impact that the COVID-19 and the state of alarm has had on Spanish social service professionals. An ad hoc questionnaire was used, administered on-line, individually, voluntarily and anonymously to 560 professionals working in social services, both in the public and private sectors, based throughout Spain. This questionnaire has five different parts: socio-demographic profiling, impact that the health crisis has had on the practice of professional functions, degree of knowledge of the measures imposed to guarantee the protection and safety of professionals and users, impact that it has had on the professional and personal development of social services professionals and, the fifth and last part, degree of adaptation of the measures aimed at the care of the vulnerable population. These results are discussed based on the situation in which professionals working in this sector find themselves in the face of the changes they are experiencing in the development of their work, and we are able to determine the profile of the workers who have felt most affected by the situation, with the consequent and foreseeable mental and emotional affectation that this implies. These professionals tend to value more negatively the set of measures developed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on Spanish social services."
https://openalex.org/W3106108271,"Ambient air pollution is one of the leading five health risks worldwide. One of the most harmful air pollutants is particulate matter (PM), which has different physical characteristics (particle size and number, surface area and morphology) and a highly complex and variable chemical composition. Our goal was first to comparatively assess the effects of exposure to PM regarding cytotoxicity, release of pro-inflammatory mediators and gene expression in human bronchial epithelia (HBE) reflecting normal and compromised health status. Second, we aimed at evaluating the impact of various PM components from anthropogenic and biogenic sources on the cellular responses. Air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures of fully differentiated HBE derived from normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) donor lungs were exposed at the apical cell surface to water-soluble PM filter extracts for 4 h. The particle dose deposited on cells was 0.9–2.5 and 8.8–25.4 μg per cm 2 of cell culture area for low and high PM doses, respectively. Both normal and CF HBE show a clear dose-response relationship with increasing cytotoxicity at higher PM concentrations. The concurrently enhanced release of pro-inflammatory mediators at higher PM exposure levels links cytotoxicity to inflammatory processes. Further, the PM exposure deregulates genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways leading to an imbalance of the antioxidant system. Moreover, we identify compromised defense against PM in CF epithelia promoting exacerbation and aggravation of disease. We also demonstrate that the adverse health outcome induced by PM exposure in normal and particularly in susceptible bronchial epithelia is magnified by anthropogenic PM components. Thus, including health-relevant PM components in regulatory guidelines will result in substantial human health benefits and improve protection of the vulnerable population."
https://openalex.org/W3104293134,"With the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative and the national strategy of “Ecological Protection and High-Quality Development in the Yellow River Basin”, the tourism development of the Yellow River basin of China is facing important opportunity. However, the spatial differences of tourism economy and the unbalanced development of interprovincial resources has become a threat for the sustainable development of the basin. By using the statistical data from 2003 to 2018, this paper aims to identify the numerical feature and spatial patterns of tourism development in the Yellow River Basin from the aspects of tourist volume (domestic tourists and inbound tourists) and tourism income (income from domestic tourism and inbound tourism) at provincial and prefectural scales. Analysis of spatial autocorrelation reveals significant clusters and outliers of tourist volume and tourism income at prefectural scale. Location condition, terrain condition, culture resources, regional policies, the interregional relationship and tourism infrastructure were the main factors influencing the spatial differences of tourism development in the Yellow River Basin. The study could offer useful information for the regional tourism management in the Yellow River Basin."
https://openalex.org/W3103262962,"The omnipresence of smartphones among adolescents and adults gives rise to the questions about excessive use and personality factors which are associated with heavier engagement with these devices. Previous studies have found behavioral similarities between smartphone use and maladaptive behaviors (e.g. drinking, gambling, drug abuse) in the context of intertemporal choice but mostly relied on participants’ self-reports regarding engagement with their phone. In this study, we collected actual usage data by smartphone application from 101 participants and assessed their tendency to discount future rewards, their reward responsiveness, self-control and consideration of future consequences. We found that smartphone screen time was correlated with choosing smaller immediate over larger delayed rewards and that usage of social media and gaming apps predicted delay discounting. Additionally, smartphone use was negatively correlated with self-control but not correlated with consideration of future consequences. Neither psychological variable could mediate the relationship between smartphone usage and delay discounting. Our findings provide further evidence that smartphone use and impulsive decision-making go hand in hand and that engagement with these devices needs to be critically examined by researchers to guide prudent behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3102866922,"Research in music and emotion has long acknowledged the importance of extra-musical cues, yet has been unable to measure their effect on emotion communication in music. The aim of this research was to understand how extra-musical cues affect emotion responses to music in two distinguishable cultures. Australian and Cuban participants ( N = 276) were instructed to name an emotion in response to written lyric excerpts from eight distinct music genres, using genre labels as cues. Lyrics were presented primed with genre labels (original priming and a false, lured genre label) or unprimed. For some genres, emotion responses to the same lyrics changed based on the primed genre label. We explain these results as emotion expectations induced by extra-musical cues. This suggests that prior knowledge elicited by lyrics and music genre labels are able to affect the musical emotion responses that music can communicate, independent of the emotion contribution made by psychoacoustic features. For example, the results show a lyric excerpt that is believed to belong to the Heavy Metal genre triggers high valence/high arousal emotions compared to the same excerpt primed as Japanese Gagaku , without the need of playing any music. The present study provides novel empirical evidence of extra-musical effects on emotion and music, and supports this interpretation from a multi-genre, cross-cultural perspective. Further findings were noted in relation to fandom that also supported the emotion expectation account. Participants with high levels of fandom for a genre reported a wider range of emotions in response to the lyrics labelled as being a song from that same specific genre, compared to lower levels of fandom. Both within and across culture differences were observed, and the importance of a culture effect discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3099228075,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) mortality estimates derived only from cohorts of patients initiated on TB treatment do not consider outcomes of patients with pretreatment loss to follow-up (LFU). We aimed to assess the effect of pretreatment LFU on TB-associated mortality in the six months following TB diagnosis at public health facilities in Uganda. Methods At ten public health facilities, we retrospectively reviewed treatment data for all patients with a positive Xpert ® MTB/RIF test result from January to June 2018. Pretreatment LFU was defined as not initiating TB treatment within two weeks of a positive test. We traced patients with pretreatment LFU to ascertain their vital status. We performed Kaplan Meier survival analysis to compare the cumulative incidence of mortality, six months after diagnosis among patients who did and did not experience pretreatment LFU. We also determined the health facility level estimates of TB associated mortality before and after incorporating deaths prior to treatment initiation among patients who experienced pretreatment LFU. Results Of 510 patients with positive test, 100 (19.6%) experienced pretreatment LFU. Of these, we ascertained the vital status of 49 patients. In the six months following TB diagnosis, mortality was higher among patients who experienced pretreatment LFU 48.1/1000py vs 22.9/1000py. Hazard ratio [HR] 3.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.61–6.30). After incorporating deaths prior to treatment initation among patients who experienced pretreatment LFU, health facility level estimates of TB associated mortality increased from 8.4% (95% CI 6.1%-11.6%) to 10.2% (95% CI 7.7%-13.4%). Conclusion Patients with confirmed TB who experience pretreatment LFU have high mortality within the first six months. Efforts should be made to prioritise linkage to treatment for this group of patients. Deaths that occur prior to treatment initation should be included when reporting TB mortality in order to more accurately reflect the health impact of TB."
https://openalex.org/W3101942493,"The G-quadruplex (GQ) is a well-studied non-canonical DNA structure formed by G-rich sequences found at telomeres and gene promoters. Biological studies suggest that GQs may play roles in regulating gene expression, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Small molecule ligands were shown to alter GQ structure and stability and thereby serve as novel therapies, particularly against cancer. In this work, we investigate the interaction of a G-rich sequence, 5’-GGGTTGGGTTGGGTTGGG-3’ (T1), with a water-soluble porphyrin, N- methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) via biophysical and X-ray crystallographic studies. UV-vis and fluorescence titrations, as well as a Job plot, revealed a 1:1 binding stoichiometry with an impressively tight binding constant of 30–50 μM -1 and ΔG 298 of -10.3 kcal/mol. Eight extended variants of T1 (named T2 –T9) were fully characterized and T7 was identified as a suitable candidate for crystallographic studies. We solved the crystal structures of the T1- and T7-NMM complexes at 2.39 and 2.34 Å resolution, respectively. Both complexes form a 5’-5’ dimer of parallel GQs capped by NMM at the 3’ G-quartet, supporting the 1:1 binding stoichiometry. Our work provides invaluable details about GQ-ligand binding interactions and informs the design of novel anticancer drugs that selectively recognize specific GQs and modulate their stability for therapeutic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3102045406,"Background The available data concerning hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in Uganda are limited, particularly in the case of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH). HBV is not routinely tested when starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). We aimed to determine the prevalence, the correlates of the risk of HBV infection, and the association with outcomes of ART among PLWH attending a busy HIV clinic in a referral hospital in Northern Uganda. Patients and methods From April to June 2016, a random sample of 1000 PLWH attending the outpatients’ clinic of St. Mary’s Hospital, Gulu, Uganda were systematically selected to undergo a rapid hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test after administering a questionnaire in this cross-sectional study. HIV care parameters were obtained from client files. Multivariate logistic regression and general linear model were used for the analysis. Results 950 of the 985 evaluable patients (77% females; mean age 42.8 years) were receiving ART. The overall prevalence of HBsAg was 7.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.2–9.6%), and was significantly lower among the females (6.8% vs 11.7%; p = 0.020). The factors independently associated with higher HBV infection were having lived in an internally displaced persons’ camp (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.76, 95% CI 1.03–2.98; p = 0.036) and having shared housing with HBV-infected people during childhood (aOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.49–7.32; p = 0.003). CD4+ T cell counts were significantly lower in HBV patients (p = 0.025), and co-infection was associated with a poorer CD4+ T cell response to ART (AOR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79–0.98; p = 0.030). Conclusions The observed prevalence of HBV among the PLWH may be underestimated or a signal of HBV decline in the region. The factors favouring horizontal HBV transmission identified suggest extending HBV screening and vaccine prophylaxis among PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3103539331,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) is an oncogenic transcription factor implicated in carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and drug resistance in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A decoy oligonucleotide targeting STAT3 offers a promising anti-tumor strategy, but achieving targeted tumor delivery of the decoy with systemic administration poses a significant challenge. We previously showed the potential for STAT3 decoy-loaded microbubbles, in conjunction with ultrasound targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC), to decrease tumor growth in murine squamous cell carcinoma. As a next step towards clinical translation, we sought to determine the anti-tumor efficacy of our STAT3 decoy delivery platform against human HNSCC and the effect of higher STAT3 decoy microbubble loading on tumor cell inhibition. STAT3 decoy was loaded on cationic lipid microbubbles (STAT3-MB) or loaded on liposome-conjugated lipid microbubbles to form STAT3-loaded liposome-microbubble complexes (STAT3-LPX). UTMC treatment efficacy with these two formulations was evaluated in vitro using viability and apoptosis assays in CAL33 (human HNSCC) cells. Anti-cancer efficacy in vivo was performed in a CAL33 tumor murine xenograft model. UTMC with STAT3-MB caused significantly lower CAL33 cell viability compared to UTMC with STAT3-LPX (56.8±8.4% vs 84.5±8.8%, respectively, p &lt;0.05). In vivo , UTMC with STAT3-MB had strong anti-tumor effects, with significantly less tumor burden and greater survival compared to that of UTMC with microbubbles loaded with a mutant control decoy and untreated control groups ( p &lt;0.05). UTMC with STAT3 decoy-loaded microbubbles significantly decreases human HNSSC tumor progression. These data set the stage for clinical translation of our microbubble platform as an imaged-guided, targeted delivery strategy for STAT3 decoy, or other nucleotide-based therapeutics, in human cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3103677422,"This study aimed to evaluate by means of Nested Polymerase Chain Reaction ( n PCR), co-cultivation and sequencing, with genetic comparison between strains (mother/newborn), the occurrence of vertical transmission of Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) from naturally occurring nannies infected for their offspring. For the detection of SRLV seropositive progenitors, blood was collected from 42 nannies in the final third of gestation in tubes with and without anticoagulant. The diagnostic tests used were Western Blot (WB) and n PCR. During the period of birth, the same blood collection procedure was performed on 73 newborns at zero hours of birth, with the same diagnostic tests. Seventeen blood samples from seven-day-old kids, proven positive for SRLV by n PCR, chosen at random, were subjected to coculture in goat synovial membrane (GSM) cells for 105 days. The pro-viral DNA extracted from the cell supernatant from the coculture was subjected to n PCR. For DNA sequencing from the n PCR products, nine positive samples were chosen at random, four nannies with their respective offspring, also positive. Each sample was performed in triplicate, thus generating 27 n PCR products of which only 19 were suitable for analysis. Among the 42 pregnant goats, in 50% (21/42) pro-viral DNA was detected by n PCR, while in the WB, only 7.14% (3/42) presented antibodies against SRLV. Regarding neonates, of the 73 kids, 34 (46.57%) were positive for the virus, using the n PCR technique, while in the serological test (WB), three positive animals (4.10%) were observed. The coculture of the 17 samples with a positive result in the n PCR was confirmed in viral isolation by amplification of the SRLV pro-viral DNA. When aligned, the pro-viral DNA sequences (nannies and their respective offspring) presented homology in relation to the standard strain CAEV Co. It was concluded that the transmission of SRLV through intrauterine route was potentially the source of infection in the newborn goats."
https://openalex.org/W3105746791,"The present study examines the extent to which individuals’ self-efficacy beliefs about their capacity to manage distinct emotions, such as anger, sadness, fear, shame and guilt, are associated with negative affect and life satisfaction in a Spanish population of diverse ages. The results attest to the validity of the Multidimensional Negative Emotions Self-Regulatory Efficacy Scale (MNESRES) and show that self-efficacy beliefs related to basic and self-conscious/moral emotions are associated differently with negative affect and life satisfaction. These findings corroborate previous findings from American and Italian populations, and they support the view that discrete emotions deserve distinct attention, either regarding their management or their association with individuals’ well-being and adjustment."
https://openalex.org/W3101121888,"Four ways archaeologists have tried to gain insights into how flintknapping creates lithic variability are fracture mechanics, controlled experimentation, replication and attribute studies of lithic assemblages. Fracture mechanics has the advantage of drawing more directly on first principles derived from physics and material sciences, but its relevance to controlled experimentation, replication and lithic studies more generally has been limited. Controlled experiments have the advantage of being able to isolate and quantify the contribution of individual variables to knapping outcomes, and the results of these experiments have provided models of flake formation that when applied to the archaeological record of flintknapping have provided insights into past behavior. Here we develop a linkage between fracture mechanics and the results of previous controlled experiments to increase their combined explanatory and predictive power. We do this by documenting the influence of Herztian cone formation, a constant in fracture mechanics, on flake platforms. We find that the platform width is a function of the Hertzian cone constant angle and the geometry of the platform edge. This finding strengthens the foundation of one of the more influential models emerging from the controlled experiments. With additional work, this should make it possible to merge more of the experimental results into a more comprehensive model of flake formation."
https://openalex.org/W3101293432,"Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are ideal seed cells for tissue engineering due to their multidirectional differentiation potential. Microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments are responsible for supporting the intracellular space. Vimentin, a type III intermediate filament protein that is specifically expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, can function as a scaffold and endow cells with tension and shear stress resistance. Actin stress fibers (ASF) act as an important physical device in stress signal transduction, providing stiffness for cells, and promoting osteogenesis. Through direct physical contact, cross-linkers, and spatial interactions, vimentin and actin networks exist as intersecting entities. Spatial interactions occur in the overlapping area of cytoskeleton subsystems, which could affect cell morphology, cell mechanics, and cell fate. However, how does the spatial organization between the cytoskeletal subsystems changed during osteogenesis, especially between vimentin and ASF, is still not understood, and its mechanism effect on cell fate remains unclear. In our study, WB experiment was used to detect the expression changes in Vimentin, ASF, and other proteins. Cells were reconstructed by three-dimensional scanning with fluorescence microscope, and the spatial thickness of vimentin and ASF cytoskeletons and the thickness of the overlapping area between them were calculated, respectively, so as to observe the spatial reorganization of vimentin and ASF in cells. Cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin polymerization) and vimentin upregulated/downregulated cells were used to verify the change in the spatial organization between vimentin and ASF and its influence on osteogenesis. Then, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was downregulated to illuminate the regulatory mechanisms of spatial organization between vimentin and ASF during osteogenesis. The amounts and the spatial positions of vimentin and actin stress fiber exhibited opposite trends during osteogenesis. Through controlling the anchor sites on the nucleus, intermediate filaments vimentin can reduce the spatial proportion of actin stress fibers, which can be regulated by HSP27. In addition, depolymerization of actin stress fibers lead to lower osteogenic differentiation ability, resulting in osteogenesis and lipogenesis existed simultaneously, that can be resisted by vimentin. Our data indicate that the spatial reorganization of vimentin and actin stress fibers is a key factor in the regulation of the differentiation state of hASCs. And their spatial overlapping area is detrimental to hASCs osteogenesis, providing a new perspective for further exploring the mechanism underlying hASCs osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3101624500,"Objective The occurrence of pneumonia separates severe cases of COVID-19 from the majority of cases with mild disease. However, the factors determining whether or not pneumonia develops remain to be fully uncovered. We therefore explored the associations of several lifestyle factors with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. Methods Between May and July 2020, we conducted an online survey of 201 adults in Germany who had recently gone through COVID-19, predominantly as outpatients. Of these, 165 had a PCR-based diagnosis and 36 had a retrospective diagnosis by antibody testing. The survey covered demographic information, eight lifestyle factors, comorbidities and medication use. We defined the main outcome as the presence vs. the absence of signs of pneumonia, represented by dyspnea, the requirement for oxygen therapy or intubation. Results Signs of pneumonia occurred in 39 of the 165 individuals with a PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19 (23.6%). Among the lifestyle factors examined, only overweight/obesity was associated with signs of pneumonia (odds ratio 2.68 (1.29–5.59) p = 0.008). The observed association remained significant after multivariate adjustment, with BMI as a metric variable, and also after including the antibody-positive individuals into the analysis. Conclusions This exploratory study finds an association of overweight/obesity with signs of pneumonia in COVID-19. This finding suggests that a signal proportional to body fat mass, such as the hormone leptin, impairs the body’s ability to clear SARS-CoV-2 before pneumonia develops. This hypothesis concurs with previous work and should be investigated further to possibly reduce the proportion of severe cases of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3103037243,"Biomonitoring is an essential tool for assessing ecological conditions and informing management strategies. The application of DNA metabarcoding and high throughput sequencing has improved data quantity and resolution for biomonitoring of taxa such as macroinvertebrates, yet, there remains the need to optimise these methods for other taxonomic groups. Diatoms have a longstanding history in freshwater biomonitoring as bioindicators of water quality status. However, multi-substrate periphyton collection, a common diatom sampling practice, is time-consuming and thus costly in terms of labour. This study examined whether the benthic kick-net technique used for macroinvertebrate biomonitoring could be applied to bulk-sample diatoms for metabarcoding. To test this approach, we collected samples using both conventional multi-substrate microhabitat periphyton collections and bulk-tissue kick-net methodologies in parallel from replicated sites with different habitat status (good/fair). We found there was no significant difference in community assemblages between conventional periphyton collection and kick-net methodologies or site status, but there was significant difference between diatom communities depending on site ( P = 0.042). These results show the diatom taxonomic coverage achieved through DNA metabarcoding of kick-net is suitable for ecological biomonitoring applications. The shift to a more robust sampling approach and capturing diatoms as well as macroinvertebrates in a single sampling event has the potential to significantly improve efficiency of biomonitoring programmes that currently only use the kick-net technique to sample macroinvertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W3098554415,"In recent years, methylene blue (MB) has attracted considerable interest as a potential drug for the treatment of methemoglobinemia and neurodegenerative diseases. MB is active against microorganisms from various taxonomic groups. However, no studies have yet been conducted on the effect of MB on the intestinal microbiome of model animals. The aim of this work was to study the effect of different concentrations of MB on the mouse gut microbiome and its relationship with the cognitive abilities of mice. We showed that a low MB concentration (15 mg/kg/day) did not cause significant changes in the microbiome composition. The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio decreased relative to the control on the 2 nd and 3 rd weeks. A slight decrease in the levels Actinobacteria was detected on the 3 rd week of the experiment. Changes in the content of Delta , Gamma , and Epsilonproteobacteria have been also observed. We did not find significant alterations in the composition of intestinal microbiome, which could be an indication of the development of dysbiosis or other gut dysfunction. At the same time, a high concentration of MB (50 mg/kg/day) led to pronounced changes, primarily an increase in the levels of Delta , Gamma and Epsilonproteobacteria . Over 4 weeks of therapy, the treatment with high MB concentration has led to an increase in the median content of Proteobacteria to 7.49% vs. 1.61% in the control group. Finally, we found that MB at a concentration of 15 mg/kg/day improved the cognitive abilities of mice, while negative correlation between the content of Deferribacteres and cognitive parameters was revealed. Our data expand the understanding of the relationship between MB, cognitive abilities, and gut microbiome in respect to the antibacterial properties of MB."

Intraoperative quality assessment of tissue perfusion with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence using a near-infrared camera system has been described in different ways and for different indications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate fluorescent imaging (FI) in the quantitative assessment of intestinal perfusion in a gastric tube model in pigs and to compare the results to results obtained with florescent microspheres (FM), the gold standard for tissue perfusion. Methods Seven pigs (56.0±3.0 kg), both males and females, underwent gastric tube formation after transection and ligation of the gastric arteries, except the right gastroepiploic artery, to avoid collateral blood flow. After baseline assessment (T0), hypotension (T1) was induced by propofol (Karampinis et al 2017) (&lt; 60 mmHg). Then, propofol was paused to obtain normotension (T2, Mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60–90 mmHg). Finally, hypertension (T3, MAP&gt;90 mmHg) was induced by norepinephrine. Measurements were performed in three regions of interest (ROIs) under standardized conditions: the fundus (D1), corpus (D2), and prepyloric area (D3). Hemodynamic parameters and transit-time flow measurement (TTFM) in the right gastroepiploic artery were continuously assessed. FI, FM and the partial pressure of tissue oxygen (TpO 2 ) were quantified in each ROI. Results The study protocol could successfully be performed during stable hemodynamics. Flow in the gastroepiploic artery measured by transit time flow measurement (TTFM) was related to hemodynamic changes between the measurements, indicating improved blood flow with increasing MAP. The distal part of the gastric tube (D1) showed significantly (p&lt;0.05) impaired perfusion compared to the proximal parts D3 and D2 using FM. ICG-FI also showed the highest values in D3 and the lowest values in D1 at all hemodynamic levels (T1-T3; p&lt;0,05). Conclusion Visual and quantitative assessment of gastric tube perfusion is feasible in an experimental setting using ICG-FI. This might be a promising tool for intraoperative assessment during visceral surgery in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3100025133,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) represent a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid cells with immunoregulatory function in cancer and autoimmune diseases. In humans, two subsets of MDSC were determined based on the characteristic surface markers, monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) and granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC). Expansion of MDSC has been reported in some murine models and patients with autoimmune diseases and their immune-suppressive properties were characterized. However, the exact role of MDSC in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases is more complex and/or controversial. In type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), the increased frequency of MDSC was found in the blood of T1D patients but their suppressor capacity was diminished. In our study, we assessed the role of M-MDSC in the pathogenesis of T1D and showed for the first time the increased frequency of M-MDSC not only in the blood of T1D patients but also in their at-risk relatives compared to healthy donors. T1D patients with inadequate long term metabolic control showed an elevation of M-MDSC compared to patients with better disease control. Furthermore, we described the positive correlation between the percentage of M-MDSC and Th17 cells and IFN-γ producing T cells in T1D patients and their at-risk relatives. Finally, we found that the ability of M-MDSC to suppress autologous T cells is efficient only at the high MDSC: T cells ratio and dependent on cell-cell-contact and TGF-β production. Our data show that the engagement of MDSC in the pathogenesis of T1D is evident, yet not entirely explored and more experiments are required to clarify whether MDSC are beneficial or harmful in T1D."
https://openalex.org/W3102315791,"Aim This study aimed to investigate the predictors of maternal parenting self-efficacy when the children concerned are in the early years of life. Method A descriptive-analytical research study was carried out among 213 women who were in the early months of the postpartum period and attending healthcare facilities in Irbid, Jordan. The State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) and the Maternal Parenting Self-Efficacy (PMP S-E) tool were used to collect the data. Results A significant correlation was found between the scores in self-efficacy and the quality of marriage relations (B = 3.56, P = 001), family income (B = 1.97, P = .05), employment (B = 4.027, P = .027), education (B = 2.48, P = .004), and living with extended family (B = 5.28, P = .02). Conclusion The findings of this study show that MPSE is significantly associated with various predictors. These predictors are the mother’s education, income, whether she lives with extended family, her quality of marriage, and her employment. Maternal anxiety was found not to be a predictor for MPSE and this may explain other factors such as social support and living with extended family. Implication It is essential for nurses to understand maternal parenting self-efficacy, therefore, including the concept of maternal parenting self-efficacy in nursing curricula can help raise awareness of this important concept. Understanding maternal parenting self-efficacy is necessary for nurses to evaluate the mothers’ parenting self-efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3103695890,"Floristic surveys are crucial to the conservation of biodiversity, but the vast majority of such surveys are limited to listing species names, and few take into account the evolutionary history of species. Here, we combine classical taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic (DNA barcoding) approaches to catalog the biodiversity of pteridophytes (ferns and lycophytes) of the Nectandra Cloud Forest Reserve, Costa Rica. Surveys were carried out over three field seasons (2008, 2011, and 2013), resulting in 176 species representing 69 genera and 22 families of pteridophytes. Our literature survey of protected areas in Costa Rica shows that Nectandra has an exceptionally diverse pteridophyte flora for its size. Plastid rbcL was selected as a DNA barcode marker and obtained for &gt;95% of pteridophyte taxa at this site. Combined molecular and morphological analyses revealed two previously undescribed taxa that appear to be of hybrid origin. The utility of rbcL for species identification was assessed by calculating minimum interspecific distances and found to have a failure rate of 18%. Finally we compared the distribution of minimum interspecific rbcL distances with two other areas that have been the focus of pteridophyte molecular surveys: Japan and Tahiti. The comparison shows that Nectandra is more similar to Japan than Tahiti, which may reflect the biogeographic history of these floras."
https://openalex.org/W3104783947,"Background Management of Non-Compressible Torso Hemorrhage (NCTH) consists primarily of aortic occlusion which has significant adverse outcomes, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, in prolonged field care paradigms. One promising avenue for treatment is through use of RevMedx XSTAT 30™ (an FDA approved sponge-based dressing utilized for extremity wounds). We hypothesized that XSTAT 30™ would effectively mitigate NCTH during a prolonged pre-hospital period with correctable metabolic and physiologic derangements. Methods and findings Twenty-four male swine (53±2kg) were anesthetized, underwent line placement, and splenectomy. Animals then underwent laparoscopic transection of 70% of the left lobe of the liver with hemorrhage for a period of 10min. They were randomized into three groups: No intevention (CON), XSTAT 30™-Free Pellets (FP), and XSTAT 30™-Bagged Pellets (BP). Animals were observed for a pre-hospital period of 180min. At 180min, animals underwent damage control surgery (DCS), balanced blood product resuscitation and removal of pellets followed by an ICU period of 5 hours. Postoperative fluoroscopy was performed to identify remaining pellets or bags. Baseline physiologic and injury characteristics were similar. Survival rates were significantly higher in FP and BP (p&lt;0.01) vs CON. DCS was significantly longer in FP in comparison to BP (p = 0.001). Two animals in the FP group had pellets discovered on fluoroscopy following DCS. There was no significant difference in blood product or pressor requirements between groups. End-ICU lactates trended to baseline in both FP and BP groups. Conclusions While these results are promising, further study will be required to better understand the role for XSTAT in the management of NCTH."
https://openalex.org/W3106407275,"The miRNA biogenesis is tightly regulated to avoid dysfunction and consequent disease development. Here, we describe modulation of miRNA processing as a novel noncanonical function of the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) enzyme in monocytic cells. In differentiated Mono Mac 6 (MM6) cells, we found an in situ interaction of 5-LO with Dicer, a key enzyme in miRNA biogenesis. RNA sequencing of small noncoding RNAs revealed a functional impact, knockout of 5-LO altered the expression profile of several miRNAs. Effects of 5-LO could be observed at two levels. qPCR analyses thus indicated that (a) 5-LO promotes the transcription of the evolutionarily conserved miR-99b/let-7e/miR-125a cluster and (b) the 5-LO-Dicer interaction downregulates the processing of pre-let-7e, resulting in an increase in miR-125a and miR-99b levels by 5-LO without concomitant changes in let-7e levels in differentiated MM6 cells. Our observations suggest that 5-LO regulates the miRNA profile by modulating the Dicer-mediated processing of distinct pre-miRNAs. 5-LO inhibits the formation of let-7e which is a well-known inducer of cell differentiation, but promotes the generation of miR-99b and miR-125a known to induce cell proliferation and the maintenance of leukemic stem cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W3106436909,"The physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) is a measurement instrument that is commonly used in monitoring and intervention research to assess how much people enjoy being physically active, as this has been related to physical activity adherence. However, while the measurement properties of PACES are well-researched in the English language, there is a gap of research in the German language, especially when looking at adults. Thus, the purpose of this work was to examine reliability, factorial validity, criterion-related validity, and measurement invariance across sex, age groups and time of the PACES for German-speaking adults. Data was obtained from the Motorik-Modul-Study (MoMo) in which 863 adults (53.5% female; mean age = 20.9 years) were examined. To investigate measurement invariance across age groups, data from 2,274 adolescents (50.5% female; mean age = 14.4 years) was obtained additionally. The study provided a nationwide representative sample for Germany. Results showed high internal consistency of PACES in adults (Cronbach’s α = .94). Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the invariance of the measure across age groups, time, and sex. Criterion-related validity could be shown as the global factor significantly correlated with overall physical activity, physical activity in sports clubs, and leisure-time physical activity. The analyses of factorial structure indicated a method effect for positively and negatively worded items. Correlated uniqueness, latent method factor and a hybrid model were applied to analyze the method effect and results indicated that the method effect of positively worded items was predictive of physical activity independently of the global factor. Overall, it can be concluded that PACES is reliable, valid and invariant measure of physical activity enjoyment to be used in German-speaking adults. Further studies are warranted to examine the factorial structure of the PACES and the consequences of the method effect."
https://openalex.org/W3101628588,"Background Canada is an ethnically-diverse country, yet its lack of ethnicity information in many large databases impedes effective population research and interventions. Automated ethnicity classification using machine learning has shown potential to address this data gap but its performance in Canada is largely unknown. This study conducted a large-scale machine learning framework to predict ethnicity using a novel set of name and census location features. Methods Using census 1901, the multiclass and binary class classification machine learning pipelines were developed. The 13 ethnic categories examined were Aboriginal (First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and all-combined)), Chinese, English, French, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Scottish, and others. Machine learning algorithms included regularized logistic regression, C-support vector, and naïve Bayes classifiers. Name features consisted of the entire name string, substrings, double-metaphones, and various name-entity patterns, while location features consisted of the entire location string and substrings of province, district, and subdistrict. Predictive performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1, Area Under the Curve for Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, and accuracy. Results The census had 4,812,958 unique individuals. For multiclass classification, the highest performance achieved was 76% F1 and 91% accuracy. For binary classifications for Chinese, French, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and others, the F1 ranged 68–95% (median 87%). The lower performance for English, Irish, and Scottish (F1 ranged 63–67%) was likely due to their shared cultural and linguistic heritage. Adding census location features to the name-based models strongly improved the prediction in Aboriginal classification (F1 increased from 50% to 84%). Conclusions The automated machine learning approach using only name and census location features can predict the ethnicity of Canadians with varying performance by specific ethnic categories."
https://openalex.org/W3100384426,"Accumulating evidence suggests that rhythmic temporal structures in the environment influence memory formation. For example, stimuli that appear in synchrony with the beat of background, environmental rhythms are better remembered than stimuli that appear out-of-synchrony with the beat. This rhythmic modulation of memory has been linked to entrained neural oscillations which are proposed to act as a mechanism of selective attention that prioritize processing of events that coincide with the beat. However, it is currently unclear whether rhythm influences memory formation by influencing early (sensory) or late (post-perceptual) processing of stimuli. The current study used stimulus-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the locus of stimulus processing at which rhythm temporal cues operate in the service of memory formation. Participants viewed a series of visual objects that either appeared in-synchrony or out-of-synchrony with the beat of background music and made a semantic classification (living/non-living) for each object. Participants’ memory for the objects was then tested (in silence). The timing of stimulus presentation during encoding (in-synchrony or out-of-synchrony with the background beat) influenced later ERPs associated with post-perceptual selection and orienting attention in time rather than earlier ERPs associated with sensory processing. The magnitude of post-perceptual ERPs also differed according to whether or not participants demonstrated a mnemonic benefit for in-synchrony compared to out-of-synchrony stimuli, and was related to the magnitude of the rhythmic modulation of memory performance across participants. These results support two prominent theories in the field, the Dynamic Attending Theory and the Oscillation Selection Hypothesis, which propose that neural responses to rhythm act as a core mechanism of selective attention that optimize processing at specific moments in time. Furthermore, they reveal that in addition to acting as a mechanism of early attentional selection, rhythm influences later, post-perceptual cognitive processes as events are transformed into memory."
https://openalex.org/W3100900662,"Nowadays, with the significant integration of various renewable energy, hybrid alternating current/ voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (AC/VSC-HVDC) system integrated with doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) has achieved rapidly development in smart grid. A proper control system design for hybrid AC/VSC-HVDC system plays a very crucial role for a reliable and effective power transmission. Hence, this paper designs a novel cooperative beetle antenna search (CBAS) algorithm for optimal coordinated control of hybrid AC/VSC-HVDC system integrated with DFIG. Compared with original beetle antennae search (BAS) algorithm, CBAS algorithm can significantly improve searching efficiency via an efficient cooperation with a group of multiple beetles instead of a single beetle. Particularly, CBAS algorithm can effectively escape from local optimums thanks to its dynamic balance mechanism, which can maintain appropriate trade-off between global exploration and local exploitation. Moreover, three case studies are undertaken to validate the effectiveness and superiorities and effectiveness of CBAS algorithm compared against that of other traditional meta-heuristic algorithms. Especially, the average results of fitness function acquired by CBAS algorithm is merely 46.05%, 41.18%, and 47.82% of that of PSO, GA, and BAS algorithm, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3101269119,"Objectives This study explores the promise of an intersectoral network in enhancing the response to transgender (trans) survivors of sexual assault. Methods One hundred and three representatives of healthcare and community organizations across Ontario, Canada were invited to participate in a survey. Respondents were asked to: 1) identify systemic challenges to supporting trans survivors, 2) determine barriers to collaborating across sectors, and 3) indicate how an intersectoral network might address these challenges and barriers. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative data and qualitative data were collated thematically. Results Sixty-seven representatives responded to the survey, for a response rate of 65%. Several themes capturing the challenges organizations face in supporting trans survivors were identified: Lack of knowledge and training among providers, Inadequate resources across organizations and institutions, and Limited access to and availability of appropriate services. Barriers to collaborating across sectors considered important by the overwhelming majority of respondents were: Lack of trans-positive service professionals (e.g., a paucity of sensitivity training), lack of resources (e.g., staff, staff time and workload, spaces to meet), and Institutional structures (e.g., oppressive policies, funding mandates). Four ways in which a network could address these challenges and barriers emerged from the data: Center the voices of trans communities in advocacy; Support competence of professionals to provide trans-affirming care; Provide the platform, strategies, and tools to aid in organizational change; and Create space for organizations to share ideas, goals, and resources. Conclusion Our findings deepen our understanding of important impediments to enhancing the response to trans survivors of sexual assault and the role networks of healthcare and community organizations can play in comprehensively responding to complex health and social problems."

In the present study, we focus on the AS events in poplar leaves to understand their effects on plant growth and development. The hybrid poplar ( P . alba × P . glandulosa cv.84K) leaves were collected for RNA extraction. The extracted RNA was sequenced using on an Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 platform. Using the Populus trichocarpa genome as the reference, a total of 3810 AS genes were identified (9225 AS events), which accounted for 13.51% of all the expressed genes. Intron retention was the most common AS event, accounting for 43.86% of all the AS events, followed by alternative 3′ splice sites (23.75%), alternative 5′ splice sites (23.71%), and exon skipping (8.68%). Chromosomes 10 had the most condensed AS events (33.67 events/Mb) and chromosome 19 had the least (12.42 events/Mb). Association analysis showed that AS in the poplar leaves was positively correlated with intron length, exon number, exon length, and gene expression level, and was negatively correlated with GC content. AS genes in the poplar leaves were associated mainly with inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system pathways that would be significant on wooden plant production."
https://openalex.org/W3100231645,"Background Even though anemia was highly targeted in different global strategies, many pregnant and/or lactating women and children were suffering from it and its complications. Besides this, prior trend analysis has not been conducted among pregnant and/or lactating women in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the trend and determinants of anemia change among pregnant and/or lactating women in Ethiopia. Methods The study utilized two consecutive Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) datasets. A total of 6,106 and 5,641 pregnant and/or lactating women in 2011 and 2016 survey respectively were included in the analysis. The data were analyzed by using Stata version 14.0. Logit based decomposition analysis was done to identify contributing factors for anemia change and statistical significance was determined by using P-value. Results The trend of anemia was increased from 19% in 2011 to 29% in 2016 EDHS. The analysis revealed that, 8% of the overall change in anemia was because of the change in women’s composition. Changes in the composition of pregnant and/or lactating women according to region, economic status and tobacco and/or cigarette use were the major sources of the change. Greater than 90% of the increase in anemia was due to differences in the coefficient. Mostly, the change in behaviors of the Amhara population, those who had a history of terminated pregnancy and use tobacco and/or cigarette were the sources of the change. Conclusions Anemia among pregnant and/or lactating women was increased against government interventions over the last half-decade in Ethiopia. Programmatic interventions targeting Somali and Dire Dawa regions are still needed to decrease anemia."
https://openalex.org/W3101774819,"Modern death assemblages provide insights about the early stages of fossilization and useful ecological information about the species inhabiting the ecosystem. We present the results of taphonomic monitoring of modern vertebrate carcasses and bones from Doñana National Park, a Mediterranean coastal ecosystem in Andalusia, Spain. Ten different habitats were surveyed. Half of them occur in active depositional environments (marshland, lake margin, river margin, beach and dunes). Most of the skeletal remains belong to land mammals larger than 5 kg in body weight (mainly wild and feral ungulates). Overall, the Doñana bone assemblage shows good preservation with little damage to the bones, partly as a consequence of the low predator pressure on large vertebrates. Assemblages from active depositional habitats differ significantly from other habitats in terms of the higher incidence of breakage and chewing marks on bones in the latter, which result from scavenging, mainly by wild boar and red fox. The lake-margin and river-margin death assemblages have high concentrations of well preserved bones that are undergoing burial and offer the greatest potential to produce fossil assemblages. The spatial distribution of species in the Doñana death assemblage generally reflects the preferred habitats of the species in life. Meadows seem to be a preferred winter habitat for male deer, given the high number of shed antlers recorded there. This study is further proof that taphonomy can provide powerful insights to better understand the ecology of modern species and to infer past and future scenarios for the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W3106079376,"Pulse is the base timing to which western music is commonly notated, generally expressed by a listener by performing periodic taps with their hand or foot. This cognitive construction helps organize the perception of timed events in music and is the most basic expectation in rhythms. The analysis of expectations, and more specifically the strength with which the beat is felt—the pulse clarity—has been used to analyze affect in music. Most computational models of pulse clarity, and rhythmic expectation in general, analyze the input as a whole, without exhibiting changes through a rhythmic passage. We present Tactus Hypothesis Tracker (THT), a model of pulse clarity over time intended for symbolic rhythmic stimuli. The model was developed based on ideas of beat tracking models that extract beat times from musical stimuli. Our model also produces possible beat interpretations for the rhythm, a fitness score for each interpretation and how these evolve in time. We evaluated the model’s pulse clarity by contrasting against tapping variability of human annotators achieving results comparable to a state-of-the-art pulse clarity model. We also analyzed the clarity metric dynamics on synthetic data that introduced changes in the beat, showing that our model presented doubt in the pulse estimation process and adapted accordingly to beat changes. Finally, we assessed if the beat tracking generated by the model was correct regarding listeners tapping data. We compared our beat tracking results with previous beat tracking models. The THT model beat tracking output showed generally correct estimations in phase but exhibits a bias towards a musically correct subdivision of the beat."
https://openalex.org/W3098997898,"Disruption of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) migration and invasion is considered to be responsible for pathological placentation in preeclampsia (PE). Cyclin G2 (CCNG2) is an atypical cyclin that inhibits cell cycle progression. However, its biological function and underlying molecular mechanism in PE are poorly understood. In this study, clinical data demonstrated that CCNG2 was significantly upregulated in PE placenta and associated with invasive EVT dysfunction. Additionally, Ccng2 knockout led to an attenuation of PE-like symptoms in the PE mouse model produced via treatment with NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In vitro, CCNG2 inhibited the migration, invasion, and endothelial-like network formation of human trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo. Mechanically, CCNG2 suppressed JNK-dependent Wnt/PCP signaling and its downstream indicators including epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) via promoting the polyubiquitination degradation of dishevelled 2 (Dvl2) protein in HTR8/SVneo cells. We also discovered that the E3 ligase Ring finger protein 123 (RNF123), as a novel CCNG2 target among HTR8/SVneo cells, interacted with Dvl2 and participated in CCNG2-induced polyubiquitination degradation of Dvl2. Moreover, we verified that the treatment of HTR8/SVneo cells with RNF123-specific siRNA improved polyubiquitination-induced degradation of Dvl2 and the activity of Wnt/PCP-JNK signaling mediated by CCNG2. Taken together, our results reveal that the CCNG2/RNF123/Dvl2/JNK axis may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PE through trophoblastic cell function modulation, thus probably providing us with new therapeutic strategies for PE treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3099393754,"Research transparency has been advocated as a key means of addressing the current crisis of reproducibility. This article proposes an enhanced form of research transparency, termed lifecycle transparency.

For example, such contexts might include when, where, and from whom patients’ consent and institutional review board approvals were received before a clinical trial was carried out. However, as existing open-science tools are often dedicated to certain research phases or disciplines, and thus insufficient to support lifecycle transparency, we propose a novel decentralized framework to serve as a common medium for interaction among open-science tools, and produces irrefutable and immutable proofs of progress that can be verified automatically."
https://openalex.org/W3102219323,"Objectives To identify factors associated with hospital admission and mortality within the first 30 days after enrolment in an outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) program, also analysing adequacy of the treatment regimen and clinical outcomes. Patients and methods This was a retrospective cohort study conducted between October 2016 and June 2017 in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Variables related to hospital admission and mortality were subjected to bivariate analysis, and those with a P &lt;0.05 were subjected to multivariate analysis as risk factors. Results We evaluated 276 patients, of whom 80.5% were ≥60 years of age and 69.9% had more than one comorbidity. Of the patients evaluated, 41.3% had pneumonia and 35.1% had a urinary tract infection. The most common etiological agent, isolated in 18 (31.6%) cases, was Klebsiella pneumoniae , and 13 (72,2%) strains were carbapenem resistant. The OPAT was in accordance with the culture results in 76.6% of the cases and with the institutional protocols in 76.4%. The majority (64.5%) of the patients were not admitted, and a cure or clinical improvement was achieved in 78.6%. Multivariate analysis showed that, within the first 30 days after enrolment, the absence of a physician office visit was a predictor of hospital admission ( P &lt;0.001) and mortality ( P = 0.006). Conclusions This study demonstrated the viability of OPAT in elderly patients with pulmonary or urinary tract infections in an area with a high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and that a post-discharge physician office visit is protective against hospital admission and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3102650346,"Prolonged physical inactivity in young adults may lead to deficiencies in musculoskeletal fitness, and thus a need exists to develop physical activity and exercise programmes that are effective of increasing musculoskeletal fitness. The aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of small-sided team handball training on lower limb muscle strength, postural balance and body composition in young adults. Twenty-six men and twenty-eight women were stratified for peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak ) and body fat percentage and randomly allocated to either 12 wks of small-sided recreational team handball training (THG: 14 men and 14 women, age 24.1±2.6 yrs (mean±SD), VO 2peak 39.8±5.9 ml/kg/min and body fat percentage 32.7±8.7%) or serving as non-exercising controls (CON: 12 men and 14 women, age 24.8±3.1 yrs, VO 2peak 39.7±5.0 ml/kg/min, body fat percentage 31.7±9.7%). THG trained on average 1.8 times/week for 12 wks. At 0 and 12 wks, lower limb muscle strength, rate of force development (RFD), vertical jump height and power, postural balance, body composition and muscle biopsies were assessed. No training effects were observed for maximal isokinetic or isometric knee extensor strength, maximal vertical jump height or take-off power, fibre type distribution or capillarization. Late phase (RFD) increased (+7.4%, p &lt;0.05) and postural sway excursion length was improved after training (-9%, p &lt;0.05) in THG with no difference from CON ( p &gt;0.05). Further, THG demonstrated a decrease in body fat percentage (-3.7%) accompanied by increases in whole-body fat free mass (FFM) (+2.2%), leg FFM (+2.5%), total bone mineral content (BMC) (+1.1%), leg BMC (+1.2%), total hip bone mineral density (+1.6%) and hip T-score (+50%) which differed from CON (all p &lt;0.05). In conclusion, recreational small-sided team handball training appears to effectively improve rapid force capacity, postural balance, lean and fat body mass and bone health in previously untrained young adults.

We studied the influence of allocentric coordinates on ongoing reaching movements, which has been reported to strongly affect the reaching movements of typically developing (TD) individuals. ASD and TD participants observed a target presented randomly on one of the four corners of a frame on a screen. After it disappeared, another frame was presented slightly shifted leftward/rightward. The participants touched the memorized position of the target relatively congruent with a reference frame (allocentric condition) or ignoring it (egocentric condition). Results suggested that TD individuals were apt to touch the positions in allocentric manner rather than egocentric manner, while ASDs did not show this prioritization. Our findings demonstrate that decreased utilization of visual landmarks in ongoing movement may underlie motor disabilities in autism."
https://openalex.org/W3098045897,"An adaptive sampling-based atmospheric scattering and volumetric light framework for flight simulator (FS) is proposed to enhance the immersion and realism in real-time. The framework comprises epipolar sampling (ES), visible factor culling (VFC), interactive participating media density estimating (IPMDE). The main process of proposed architecture is as follows: the scene is divided into two levels according to the distance from the camera. In the high-level pipeline, the layer close to the camera, more samples, and smaller sampling step size is used to improve image quality. Further, the IPMDE method is designed to enhance realism by achieving interactivity with the participating media and multiple light sources. Further optimization is performed by the lookup table and 3D volumetric textures, by which we can compute the density of participating media and the scattering coefficient in parallel. In the low-level pipeline, when the samples are far away from the camera, its influence on the final output is also reduced, which results in fewer samples and a bigger sampling step size. The improved ES method further reduces the number of samples involved in ray marching using the features of epipolar geometry. It then generates global light effects and shadows of distant terrain. The VFC method uses an acceleration structure to quickly find the lit segments which eliminate samples blocked by obstacles. The experimental results demonstrate our architecture achieves a better sense of reality in real-time and is very suitable for FS."
https://openalex.org/W3098769586,"Scientific articles have semantic contents that are usually quite specific to their disciplinary origins. To characterize such semantic contents, topic-modeling algorithms make it possible to identify topics that run throughout corpora. However, they remain limited when it comes to investigating the extent to which topics are jointly used together in specific documents and form particular associative patterns. Here, we propose to characterize such patterns through the identification of “topic associative rules” that describe how topics are associated within given sets of documents. As a case study, we use a corpus from a subfield of the humanities—the philosophy of science—consisting of the complete full-text content of one of its main journals: Philosophy of Science . On the basis of a pre-existing topic modeling, we develop a methodology with which we infer a set of 96 topic associative rules that characterize specific types of articles depending on how these articles combine topics in peculiar patterns. Such rules offer a finer-grained window onto the semantic content of the corpus and can be interpreted as “topical recipes” for distinct types of philosophy of science articles. Examining rule networks and rule predictive success for different article types, we find a positive correlation between topological features of rule networks (connectivity) and the reliability of rule predictions (as summarized by the F-measure). Topic associative rules thereby not only contribute to characterizing the semantic contents of corpora at a finer granularity than topic modeling, but may also help to classify documents or identify document types, for instance to improve natural language generation processes."
https://openalex.org/W3100558140,"Background Rational medication use for treatment is mandatory, particularly in children as they are vulnerable to possible hazards of drugs. Understanding the medication use pattern is of importance to identify the problems of drug therapy and to improve the appropriate use of medication among this population. Methods A post-hoc study of the RV3-BB Phase IIb trial to children aged 0–18 months which was conducted in Indonesia during January 2013 to July 2016. Any concomitant medication use and health events among 1621 trial participants during the 18 months of follow-up were documented. Information on medication use included the frequency, formulation, indication, duration of usage, number of regimens, medication types, and therapeutic classes. Results The majority of participants (N = 1333/1621; 82.2%) used at least one non-antibiotic medication for treatment during the 18-month observation period. A total of 7586 medication uses were recorded, mostly in oral formulation (90.5%). Of all illnesses recorded, 24.7% were treated with a single drug regimen of non-antibiotic medication. The most common therapeutic classes used were analgesics/antipyretics (30.1%), antihistamines for systemic use (17.4%), cough and cold preparations (13.5%), vitamins (8.6%), and antidiarrheals (6.6%). The main medication types used were paracetamol (29.9%), chlorpheniramine (16.8%), guaifenesin (8.9%), zinc (4.6%), and ambroxol (4.1%). Respiratory system disorder was the most common reason for medication use (51.9%), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (19.2%), pyrexia (16.9%), and skin disorders (7.0%). Conclusion A large number of children were exposed to at least one medication during their early life, including those where evidence of efficacy and safety in a pediatric population is lacking. This supports the need for further research on pediatric drug therapy to improve the appropriate use of medication in this population."
