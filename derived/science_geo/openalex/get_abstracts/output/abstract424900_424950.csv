https://openalex.org/W1971773700,Structure determination of proteins and other macromolecules has historically required the growth of high-quality crystals sufficiently large to diffract x-rays efficiently while withstanding radiation damage. We applied serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) using an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) to obtain high-resolution structural information from microcrystals (less than 1 micrometer by 1 micrometer by 3 micrometers) of the well-characterized model protein lysozyme. The agreement with synchrotron data demonstrates the immediate relevance of SFX for analyzing the structure of the large group of difficult-to-crystallize molecules.
https://openalex.org/W1974094726,"Wnts are lipid-modified morphogens that play critical roles in development principally through engagement of Frizzled receptors. The 3.25 angstrom structure of Xenopus Wnt8 (XWnt8) in complex with mouse Frizzled-8 (Fz8) cysteine-rich domain (CRD) reveals an unusual two-domain Wnt structure, not obviously related to known protein folds, resembling a ""hand"" with ""thumb"" and ""index"" fingers extended to grasp the Fz8-CRD at two distinct binding sites. One site is dominated by a palmitoleic acid lipid group projecting from serine 187 at the tip of Wnt's thumb into a deep groove in the Fz8-CRD. In the second binding site, the conserved tip of Wnt's ""index finger"" forms hydrophobic amino acid contacts with a depression on the opposite side of the Fz8-CRD. The conservation of amino acids in both interfaces appears to facilitate ligand-receptor cross-reactivity, which has important implications for understanding Wnt's functional pleiotropy and for developing Wnt-based drugs for cancer and regenerative medicine."

(p. 1182 ) produced left and right hemisections at different levels of the rat thoracic spinal cord to cause complete hind limb paralysis mimicking the situation in humans with spinal cord injury. Systemic application of pharmacological agents, combined with a multisystem rehabilitation program including a robotic postural neuroprosthesis, restored voluntary movements of both hind limbs."
https://openalex.org/W2015526636,"We describe a general computational method for designing proteins that self-assemble to a desired symmetric architecture. Protein building blocks are docked together symmetrically to identify complementary packing arrangements, and low-energy protein-protein interfaces are then designed between the building blocks in order to drive self-assembly. We used trimeric protein building blocks to design a 24-subunit, 13-nm diameter complex with octahedral symmetry and a 12-subunit, 11-nm diameter complex with tetrahedral symmetry. The designed proteins assembled to the desired oligomeric states in solution, and the crystal structures of the complexes revealed that the resulting materials closely match the design models. The method can be used to design a wide variety of self-assembling protein nanomaterials."

Growth methods such as chemical vapor deposition are faster, but create polycrystalline graphene sheets that contain grain boundaries that can scatter charge carriers and decrease performance. Tsen et al. (p. 1143 ) found that the presence of overlapping domains within polycrystalline graphene samples could increase conductivity of samples by an order of magnitude, allowing them to rival exfoliated samples."
https://openalex.org/W2017731476,"Predicting Catastrophic Collapse It is very difficult to predict the behavior of complex systems near tipping points, where a small change in conditions can lead to a large shift in the state of the system. Theory predicts that some generic statistical indicators can signal the approach of such tipping points, such as slower recoveries from perturbations of the system—a phenomenon called critical slowing down. Working with laboratory yeast populations, Dai et al. (p. 1175 ) provide an experimental measure for critical slowing down before catastrophic population collapse. This type of approach should help when trying to predict catastrophic thresholds in other complex systems, ranging from ecosystem transition to climate change, and even to crashes of financial markets."
https://openalex.org/W2113122247,Dissecting Chitin Binding The chitin in fungal cells walls serves as a trigger to initiate plant defenses against pathogenic fungi. Arabidopsis detects these signals through a cell surface chitin receptor whose intracellular kinase domain initiates a signaling cascade in response to chitin that activates the plant's response to infection. Liu et al. (p. 1160 ) have now solved the crystal structure of the Arabidopsis chitin receptor AtCERK1. The results show how chitin binds to the receptor and suggest that the biological response requires dimerisation of the receptor when it binds a chitin oligomer at least seven or eight subunits long.
https://openalex.org/W2083856653,"Variation on a Theme Given the incredible diversity and complexity in social behavior and ecology that exists across animal taxa, revealing the evolution of neural mechanisms for behavior is a great challenge. O'Connell and Hofmann (p. 1154 ) examined the expression profiles of several genes involved in the social behavior network and the mesolimbic reward system in 88 species across five vertebrate lineages. A remarkable level of conservation was observed in brain regions linked to social behavior and decision-making, but flexibility seems to have been maintained through variability in neuroendocrine ligand expression across the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2092508662,Insights into Amyloidogenesis The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease are generated by cleavage of the transmembrane C-terminal domain (C99) of the amyloid precursor protein by the enzyme γ-secretase. Barrett et al. (p. 1168 ) used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that C99 contains surface-associated N- and C-terminal helices and a flexibly curved transmembrane helix that is well suited to processive cleavage by γ-secretase. Elevated cholesterol levels have been found to increase Aβ generation. NMR titration together with mutagenesis revealed a binding site for cholesterol within C99 that included a motif previously implicated in protein oligomerization.
https://openalex.org/W1982899292,"Quantum field theory reconciles quantum mechanics and special relativity, and plays a central role in many areas of physics. We developed a quantum algorithm to compute relativistic scattering probabilities in a massive quantum field theory with quartic self-interactions (φ(4) theory) in spacetime of four and fewer dimensions. Its run time is polynomial in the number of particles, their energy, and the desired precision, and applies at both weak and strong coupling. In the strong-coupling and high-precision regimes, our quantum algorithm achieves exponential speedup over the fastest known classical algorithm."

Winzer et al. (p. 1704 , published online 31 May; see the Perspective by DellaPenna and O'Connor ) found that a cluster of 10 genes were key to the production of noscapine. Poppies homozygous for this gene cluster produced high levels of noscapine, heterozygous poppies produced low levels of noscapine, and those poppies lacking the gene cluster produced no noscapine. Silencing individual genes in turn and analyzing the accumulation of intermediate metabolites allowed the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine to be elucidated."

https://openalex.org/W1987515055,"Design and Build Self-assembling biomolecules are attractive building blocks in the development of functional materials. Sophisticated DNA-based materials have been developed; however, progress in designing protein-based materials has been slower. King et al. (p. 1171 ) describe a general computational method in which protein building blocks are first symmetrically docked onto a target architecture, and then binding interfaces that drive self-assembly of the building blocks are designed. As a proof of principle, trimeric building blocks were used to design self-assembling 12-subunit complexes with tetrahedral symmetry and 24-subunit complexes with octahedral symmetry. Lai et al. (p. 1129 ) were able to build a 12-subunit tetrahedral protein cage from fused oligomeric protein domains."
https://openalex.org/W2088724035,"A Timely Structure The physiology and behavior of most organisms are inextricably aligned with the day/night cycle. In mammals, these daily rhythms are generated by a circadian clock encoded by transcriptional activators and repressors operating in a feedback loop that takes about 24 hours to complete. A key participant in this loop is a heterodimeric transcriptional activator consisting of the CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins. Huang et al. (p. 189 , published online 31 May; see Perspective by Crane ) determined the crystal structure of a complex containing the PAS domains (implicated in protein-protein interactions) and the basic helix-loop-helix domains (implicated in DNA binding) from each protein. CLOCK and BMAL1 were observed to be tightly intertwined in an unusual asymmetric conformation, which may contribute to the stability and activity of the complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091653401,"No More Fusion Confusion Biophysical models explain membrane fusion as a sequence of steps—including membrane contact, formation of a fusion stalk (merger of proximal monolayers), development of contact between distal monolayers that may or may not expand (hemifusion), and, finally, rupture of this diaphragm resulting in the opening of a fusion pore. Biological membrane fusion reactions are often driven by so-called SNARE proteins. By using a reconstituted membrane fusion system, Hernandez et al. (p. 1581 , published online 31 May) have now been able to correlate precisely the states of SNARE zippering with intermediate structures along the fusion pathway. The results suggest that a tightly docked state, with a membrane distance so close that no proteins fit in between them, represents a critical fusion intermediate as a consequence of SNARE zippering. This intermediate is incompatible with a SNARE-driven stalk or with a ringlike arrangement of SNAREs depicted in most current models of membrane fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2088864189,"In high-temperature superconductivity, the process that leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, the fundamental charge carriers in any superconductor, remains mysterious. We use a femtosecond laser pump pulse to perturb superconducting Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}, and study subsequent dynamics using time- and angle-resolved photoemission and infrared reflectivity probes. Gap and quasiparticle population dynamics reveal marked dependencies on both excitation density and crystal momentum. Close to the d-wave nodes, the superconducting gap is sensitive to the pump intensity and Cooper pairs recombine slowly. Far from the nodes pumping affects the gap only weakly and recombination processes are faster. These results demonstrate a new window into the dynamical processes that govern quasiparticle recombination and gap formation in cuprates."
https://openalex.org/W2058180077,"See How They Grow Controlled assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for processes such as cell motility, cytokinesis, and tumor metastasis. The formation of new actin filaments appears to involve the protein formin paired with another actin assembly-promoting factor. Breitsprecher et al. (p. 1164 ) used triplecolor single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to visualize actin assembly promoted by the formin, mDia1, and the tumor-suppressor, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). The two assembly factors interacted directly to initiate filament assembly, after which mDia1 moved with the growing barbed ends while APC remained at the site of nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W1965162899,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is extremely aggressive and essentially incurable. Its malignancy is characterized by vigorous microvascular proliferations. Recent evidence has shown that tumor cells display the ability to drive blood-perfused vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an alternative microvascular circulation independent of endothelial cell angiogenesis. However, molecular mechanisms underlying this vascular pathogenesis are poorly understood. Here, we found that vascular channels of VM in GBM were composed of mural-like tumor cells that strongly express VEGF receptor 2 (Flk-1). To explore a potential role of Flk-1 in the vasculogenesis, we investigated two glioblastoma cell lines U87 and GSDC, both of which express Flk-1 and exhibit a vascular phenotype on Matrigel. Treatment of both cell lines with either Flk-1 gene knockdown or Flk-1 kinase inhibitor SU1498 abrogated Flk-1 activity and impaired vascular function. Furthermore, inhibition of Flk-1 activity suppressed intracellular signaling cascades, including focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2. In contrast, blockade of VEGF activity by the neutralizing antibody Bevacizumab failed to recapitulate the impact of SU1498, suggesting that Flk-1-mediated VM is independent of VEGF. Xenotransplantation of SCID/Beige mice with U87 cells and GSDCs gave rise to tumors harboring robust mural cell-associated vascular channels. Flk-1 shRNA restrained VM in tumors and subsequently inhibited tumor development. Collectively, all the data demonstrate a central role of Flk-1 in the formation of VM in GBM.

Malignant gliomas in adults.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 492-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). More than 70% of patients with GBM succumb to the disease in 2 years, and fewer than 10% are alive 5 years following the initial diagnosis (2Norden A.D. Drappatz J. Wen P.Y. Antiangiogenic therapies for high grade glioma.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 5: 610-620Google Scholar). The aggressiveness of this disease is characterized by strong vascular proliferation that is highly correlated with the malignancy of GBM. Thus, most of the current chemotherapies against GBM aim at vascular endothelial cells that orchestrate a significant component of blood vessels (3Nghiemphu P.L. Liu W. Lee Y. Than T. Graham C.

Bevacizumab and chemotherapy for recurrent glioblastoma: a single-institution experience.Neurology. 2009; 72: 1217-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, it has been increasingly documented that an anti-angiogenic monotherapy did not give rise to a promise for improvement of patient overall survival, as drug resistance or angiogenic rebound occurs once the treatment is terminated (4Bergers G. Hanahan D. Modes of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar, 5Ellis L.M. Hicklin D.J. VEGF-targeted therapy: mechanisms of anti-tumor activity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). For example, clinical trials using a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody (Bevacizumab, also named Avastin) in recurrent GBMs revealed minimal benefit to patient survival (4Bergers G. Hanahan D.

Recently, a number of research groups have demonstrated that vasculogenic mimicry (VM), an alternative vascular mechanism, contributes a central role to the vascularization of GBM in which tumor cells participate (10Yue W.Y.

Growing evidence suggests that this matrix-embedded, blood-perfused microvasculature renders tumor progression independent of endothelial cell angiogenesis (13Maniotis A.J. Folberg R. Hess A. Seftor E.A. Gardner L.M. Pe'er J. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Hendrix M.J. Vascular channel formation by human melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro. Vasculogenic mimicry.Am. J.

Scand. 2004; 112: 508-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In addition, this VM is believed to be at least partially ascribed to the multipotency of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) capable of transdifferentiation into vascular nonendothelial cells (15Ping Y.F. Bian X.W. Concise review: Contribution of cancer stem cells to neovascularization.Stem Cells. 2011; 29: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Chen Y. Jing Z. Luo C. Zhuang M. Xia J. Chen Z. Wang Y. Vasculogenic mimicry-potential target for glioblastoma therapy. An in vitro and in vivo study.Med. Oncol. 2012; 29: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies suggest that transdifferentiation of GSCs into mural-like tumor cells enables these vascular cells to constitute blood-perfused channels, whereas endothelial cells induce angiogenesis in GBM. An angiogenic factor VEGF is appreciated to evoke vascular endothelial cell angiogenesis mainly through binding its membrane-bound receptors such as VEGF receptor 1/Flt-1 and VEGF receptor 2/Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 or kinase domain receptor (Flk-1/KDR) (17Neufeld G.

Flk-1 is the earliest differentiation marker for endothelial cells and blood cells (19Eichmann A. Corbel C. Nataf V. Vaigot P. Bréant C. Le Douarin N.M. Ligand-dependent development of the endothelial and hemopoietic lineages from embryonic mesodermal cells expressing vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Failure of blood-island formation and vasculogenesis in Flk-1-deficient mice.Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). Expression of Flk-1 in the adult is restricted to endothelial cells and is transiently up-regulated during angiogenesis (17Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors.FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Flk-1 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality because of the lack of hematopoietic and endothelial lineage development (20Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M.

Role of the Flt-1 receptor tyrosine kinase in regulating the assembly of vascular endothelium.Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Once binding with VEGF, Flk-1 undergoes autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues located in an intracellular kinase domain and it subsequently activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and MAPK activation, leading to endothelial cell angiogenesis (e.g. cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation) (22Sun J.

Interestingly, previous studies showed that transdifferentiation of embryonic stem cells into vascular endothelial cells and mural cells required expression of Flk-1 (24Yamashita J. Itoh H.

Here, we take advantage of GBM-derived tumor cell lines capable of developing VM to investigate a role of Flk-1 in the vasculogenesis of GBM. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms will offer considerable value for devising a novel therapeutic regimen targeting nonendothelial vascular proliferation in concert with current anti-angiogenic therapy. U87 cells were purchased from the ATCC. GSDCs were established from a tumor sample of a patient with GBM after the study was approved by Baystate Medical Center Institutional Review Board. Briefly, a small fragment of a tumor sample was digested with an enzymatic mixture containing 1.3 mg/ml trypsin (Sigma), 0.67 mg/ml type 1-S hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 0.13 mg/ml kynurenic acid (Sigma). Following extensive washing, cells were resuspended and cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml bFGF and EGF for 2 weeks. Then the cells were transferred to a new plate and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as the same medium used for U87 cells. GSDCs at passages between 10 and 20 were used for the study. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) established previously were grown in a medium from the EBM2 kit supplemented with hydrocortisone, EGF, and 10% FBS (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ) (27Shao R. Guo X. Human microvascular endothelial cells immortalized with human telomerase catalytic protein. A model for the study of in vitro angiogenesis.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

A Matrigel-based tube formation assay to assess the vasculogenic activity of tumor cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; 55: 3040Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated on growth factor-reduced Matrigel (10 mg/ml, BD Biosciences) overnight, and tubules were fixed with 10% formalin and imaged followed by quantification. Density of tubules was quantified from random selection of three fields under a microscope. A PGPU6-GFP-neo shRNA expression vector containing DNA oligonucleotides (21 bp) (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) specifically targeting the C terminus (5′-GCTTGGCCCGGGATATTTATA-3′) of Flk-1 or the vector with non-sense oligonucleotides as a control was transfected into U87 cells using FuGENE 6. Cells were selected in 800 μg/ml G418 starting 48 h after transfection, and GFP expression was monitored to evaluate transfection efficiency. Cell lysates were processed as described previously (29Shao R. Hamel K. Petersen L. Cao Q.J. Arenas R.B. Bigelow C. Bentley B. Yan W. YKL-40, a secreted glycoprotein, promotes tumor angiogenesis.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 4456-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The lysates were then incubated with an anti-pY20 antibody (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. The immunocomplex was extensively washed, and the samples were run on SDS-PAGE. Then proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (VWR, Rockford, IL) and incubated with an anti-Flk-1 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-FAK polyclonal antibody (BIOSOURCE). Membranes were then incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (The Jackson Laboratory). Specific signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (VWR Scientific). For immunoblotting only, blot membranes were incubated with one of a series of primary antibodies against Flk-1, CD31, Tie1, Tie2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SMa (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), VE-, N-cad (Invitrogen), FAK (BIOSOURCE), pERK1/2, ERK1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma). Cells plated on 24-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. The samples were incubated overnight with antibodies specific for Flk-1 (rabbit), VE-cad (mouse), and SMa (rabbit). Alexa Fluor 488 and 555 goat anti-mouse and -rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) were added for 1 h followed by nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Invitrogen). Live/Dead Assay kit (Invitrogen) was employed to determine living versus dead cells as instructed by the manufacturer. Briefly, living cells were stained with 2 μm calcein AM (green), and dead cells were stained with 4 μm ethidium homodimer (red) for 30 min. Cells were then imaged, and live/dead cells were quantified. All animal experiments were performed with the approval of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts and Baystate Medical Center. SCID/Beige mice were injected subcutaneously with U87 cells (8 × 106) or GSDCs (5 × 106) in 0.2 ml of PBS. Tumors arising from injected cells were monitored weekly for 8 weeks, after which the animals were humanely sacrificed. Mice were examined for expression of GFP using the Maestro in vivo imaging system (CRI, Woburn, MA). The tumors were measured, and volume was calculated as follows: volume = length × width2 × 0.52. Paraffin-embedded or frozen tumor tissues were cut to 6 μm thickness and processed for immunohistochemical analysis. In brief, samples were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 30 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by incubation with blocking buffer containing 10% goat serum for 1 h. The samples then were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with mouse anti-Flk-1 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-hCD31 (1:100), anti-hCD34 (1:200), anti-SMa (1:500) (Dako Inc., Carpentaria, CA), rat anti-mCD31 (1:50, BD Biosciences) monoclonal antibodies, or rabbit anti-PDGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-GFAP (1:5000, Dako) polyclonal antibodies. Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:100) conjugated to HRP were added for 1 h. Finally, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate (Dako) was introduced for several minutes, and after washing, methyl green or PAS was used for counterstaining. Dual immunohistochemistry labeling was performed using one primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by application of the secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and incubated with permanent red as a substrate (G2 kit, Dako). After extensive washing with TBST, the samples were then incubated with another primary antibody at room temperature for 2 h followed by application of a secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. Finally, 3,3′-diaminobenzidine substrate and counterstaining were performed as described above. Three to five specimens randomly cut from each tumor block were processed for the IHC staining. Following the double staining with SMa and CD31, each sample was subjected to quantification of all the vessels that were positively stained for SMa, CD31, or both SMa and CD31 and that were negative staining but contained blood cells in the lumens. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) was used to quantify vessel density. For dual immunofluorescent staining, tumor specimens were incubated with a mouse anti-hCD31 or Flk-1 for 2 h followed by incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (1:250) for 1 h. Then the samples were similarly incubated with a rabbit anti-SMa or GFAP antibody followed by incubation with a goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor antibody. Finally, DAPI was added to stain nuclei. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E., and n refers to the numbers of individual experiments performed. Differences among groups were determined using one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls test. The 0.05 level of probability was used as the criterion of significance. To determine whether VM is present in GBM, we examined tumor samples from 11 patients with GBM. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) showed a vascular pattern spread throughout the majority of the tumor sections in 7 of 11 tumors, and PAS staining of vascular basement membrane revealed extensive blood-perfused channels, most of which harbored vascular cells that displayed a torturous phenotype dissimilar to endothelial cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Two of the other tumors contained a minimal level of vascular channels, whereas the final two were avascular. To determine whether these vascular channels are composed of mural cells, we utilized an IHC approach by staining the samples with smooth muscle α-actin (SMa) and PDGFR, both of which are vascular pericyte markers. A number of these vessels exhibited strong staining of both SMa and PDGFR (Fig. 1, C and D). In a dual staining analysis of SMa and CD31, a vascular endothelial cell marker, we found that some vessels contained endothelial cells and others consisted of SMa-positive cells (Fig. 1E). In addition, IHC analysis indicated that these mural cell-associated vessels were positive for Flk-1 (Fig. 1F). To validate that these mural-like tumor cells express Flk-1, we performed a dual immunofluorescent assay and found that a significant component of the vascular channels co-expressed SMa with Flk-1 (Fig. 1G) but not with CD31 (Fig. 1H). These data demonstrate that VM present in GBM is principally composed of mural cells that express Flk-1. To test our hypothesis that tumor cells act as vascular mural-like cells to participate in VM, we investigated two glioblastoma tumor cell lines as follows: U87 cells and GSDCs that were established from patients with GBM. We performed immunoblotting to assess expression of mural and endothelial cell markers. Both tumor lines U87 and GSDCs expressed stronger Flk-1 than that observed in HMVECs (Fig. 2A). Contrary to HMVECs that express a barely detectable level of SMa, U87 cells and GSDCs expressed a higher level of SMa. Immunocytochemistry analysis unveiled the same expression pattern of Flk-1 and SMa as the immunoblotting results (Fig. 2, A and B). However, it was notable that both U87 cells and GSDCs, in contrast to HMVECs, did not express endothelial cell-specific markers VE-cad, CD31, Tie1, or Tie2, demonstrating that GSDCs are distinct from endothelial cells. U87 cells and GSDCs expressed higher N-cad than did HMVECs, consistent with previous reports that vascular endothelial cells also express N-cad in addition to VE-cad (30Paik J.H. Skoura A. Chae S.S. Cowan A.E. Han D.K. Proia R.L. Hla T.

Radice G.L. N-cadherin is required for neural crest remodeling of the cardiac outflow tract.Dev. Biol. 2006; 299: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To confirm that this mural cell expression pattern was not just an artifact of one particular patient-derived cell line, a second patient-derived cell line, GSDC-2, was created. GSDC-2 also showed a nearly identical expression pattern as GSDCs (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that this mural marker expression is a common characteristic of GBM cells. Should U87 cells and GSDCs truly represent cells capable of developing vascular channels, they might possess the vasculogenic activity as do endothelial cells (27Shao R. Guo X.

Commun. 2004; 321: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Francescone 3rd, R.A. Faibish M. Shao R. A Matrigel-based tube formation assay to assess the vasculogenic activity of tumor cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2011; 55: 3040Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed a tube formation assay that commonly recapitulates the ability of endothelial cells to develop vasculature in vitro. U87 cells and GSDCs formed a capillary phenotype on Matrigel in a cell number-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). To evaluate if this vascular event is dependent on Flk-1 as expressed by mural cells (Fig. 1) in GBM, we employed a Flk-1 kinase inhibitor SU1498. Treatment with SU1498 inhibited the ability of both cells to induce a capillary-like structure by ∼72–80% relative to controls (Fig. 3, C and D). To provide additional genetic evidence that Flk-1 is important for vasculogenic function, we used an Flk-1 shRNA gene knockdown approach. Suppression of Flk-1 was associated with a corresponding reduction in SMa expression and tube formation as tubules were decreased by 80% of control tubules (Fig. 3E). These findings were also validated with the GSDC-2 cell line derived from another patient (supplemental Fig. 1C). In all the tube formation assays, treatment of either SU1498 or Flk-1 gene knockdown did not result in cell growth arrest or cell death (supplemental Fig. 2). Next, we determined whether this Flk-1-mediated vascular activity requires VEGF. We treated these tumor cells with the anti-VEGF-neutralizing antibody Bevacizumab in the tube formation. As tested earlier, both U87 cells and GSDCs decreased the ability to develop tubules in the presence of SU1498. In contrast, they did not display dysfunction of the vascular formation once Bevacizumab was added (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 1C). Accordingly, expression of SMa in these cells was reduced by SU1498 but not by Bevacizumab, indicative of a VEGF-independent event. Regardless of higher expression of VEGF by U87 cells and GSDCs than that by HMVECs, this vasculogenic capability of these tumor cells was distinct from the angiogenic signature of vascular endothelial cells that highly responded to Bevacizumab in the development of tubules (Fig. 4C). To further validate that Flk-1-mediated vasculogenesis does not require VEGF, we stimulated U87 cells with VEGF in the tube formation assay. Exposure of both U87 control cells and the cells expressing Flk-1 shRNA to VEGF did not alter vascular development, as VEGF neither enhanced vascularization in the control cells nor rescued the impaired capability of tube formation in Flk-1 shRNA cells (Fig. 4D). These data support the notion that Flk-1-mediated VM is independent of VEGF. We then sought to determine whether Flk-1 kinase activity plays a core role in signaling activation independent of VEGF. Both U87 cells and GSDCs were treated with either SU1498 or Bevacizumab overnight (Fig. 5A). Consistent with earlier functional analyses, treatment of these cells with SU1498 resulted in 80–86% reduction of tyrosine-phosphorylated Flk-1 compared with control levels (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, Bevacizumab failed to alter pFlk-1 levels. To further identify intracellular signaling pathways in response to Flk-1 activation, we focused on FAK and downstream effector MAPK ERK1/2, as these intracellular factors mediate Flk-1 signaling in vascular endothelial cells (24Yamashita J. Itoh H. Hirashima M. Ogawa M. Nishikawa S. Yurugi T. Naito M. Nakao K. Nishikawa S.

https://openalex.org/W2002537919,"Nitrogen is a dominant regulator of vegetation dynamics, net primary production, and terrestrial carbon cycles; however, most ecosystem models use a rather simplistic relationship between leaf nitrogen content and photosynthetic capacity. Such an approach does not consider how patterns of nitrogen allocation may change with differences in light intensity, growing-season temperature and CO2 concentration. To account for this known variability in nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships, we develop a mechanistic nitrogen allocation model based on a trade-off of nitrogen allocated between growth and storage, and an optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The developed model is able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and radiation when evaluated against published data of Vc,max (maximum carboxylation rate) and Jmax (maximum electron transport rate). A sensitivity analysis of the model for herbaceous plants, deciduous and evergreen trees implies that elevated CO2 concentrations lead to lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation but higher allocation to storage. Higher growing-season temperatures cause lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation, due to higher nitrogen requirements for light capture pigments and for storage. Lower levels of radiation have a much stronger effect on allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation for herbaceous plants than for trees, resulting from higher nitrogen requirements for light capture for herbaceous plants. As far as we know, this is the first model of complete nitrogen allocation that simultaneously considers nitrogen allocation to light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, respiration and storage, and the responses of each to altered environmental conditions. We expect this model could potentially improve our confidence in simulations of carbon-nitrogen interactions and the vegetation feedbacks to climate in Earth system models."
https://openalex.org/W2067499125,"Nadia Dominici and her colleagues have developed a multidirectional robotic neurorehabilitation system that is capable of operating as a propulsive or postural neuroprosthesis and overcomes some of the limitations of existing systems. The robotic interface allows for the independent assessment and restoration of motor function in rats with mild to severe neuromotor disorders and is validated in various models of spinal cord injury and stroke. Central nervous system (CNS) disorders distinctly impair locomotor pattern generation and balance, but technical limitations prevent independent assessment and rehabilitation of these subfunctions. Here we introduce a versatile robotic interface to evaluate, enable and train pattern generation and balance independently during natural walking behaviors in rats. In evaluation mode, the robotic interface affords detailed assessments of pattern generation and dynamic equilibrium after spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke. In enabling mode, the robot acts as a propulsive or postural neuroprosthesis that instantly promotes unexpected locomotor capacities including overground walking after complete SCI, stair climbing following partial SCI and precise paw placement shortly after stroke. In training mode, robot-enabled rehabilitation, epidural electrical stimulation and monoamine agonists reestablish weight-supported locomotion, coordinated steering and balance in rats with a paralyzing SCI. This new robotic technology and associated concepts have broad implications for both assessing and restoring motor functions after CNS disorders, both in animals and in humans."

The present study was designed to investigate the association between RDW values and different disease states in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients. In addition, we analyzed whether RDW is associated with mortality in the HBV-infected patients.One hundred and twenty-three patients, including 16 with acute hepatitis B (AHB), 61 with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 46 with chronic severe hepatitis B (CSHB), and 48 healthy controls were enrolled. In all subjects, a blood sample was collected at admission to examine liver function, renal function, international normalized ratio and routine hematological testing. All patients were followed up for at least 4 months. A total of 10 clinical chemistry, hematology, and biochemical variables were analyzed for possible association with outcomes by using Cox proportional hazards and multiple regression models. RDW values at admission in patients with CSHB (18.30±3.11%, P<0.001), CHB (16.37±2.43%, P<0.001) and AHB (14.38±1.72%, P<0.05) were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (13.03±1.33%). Increased RDW values were clinically associated with severe liver disease and increased 3-month mortality rate. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that RDW values and the model for end-stage liver disease score were independent predictors for mortality (both P<0.001).RDW values are significantly increased in patients with hepatitis B and associated with its severity. Moreover, RDW values are an independent predicting factor for the 3-month mortality rate in patients with hepatitis B."
https://openalex.org/W2171828133,"Microenvironments of biological cells are dominated in vivo by macromolecular crowding and resultant excluded volume effects. This feature is absent in dilute in vitro cell culture. Here, we induced macromolecular crowding in vitro by using synthetic macromolecular globules of nm-scale radius at physiological levels of fractional volume occupancy. We quantified the impact of induced crowding on the extracellular and intracellular protein organization of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) via immunocytochemistry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and AFM-enabled nanoindentation. Macromolecular crowding in extracellular culture media directly induced supramolecular assembly and alignment of extracellular matrix proteins deposited by cells, which in turn increased alignment of the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. The resulting cell-matrix reciprocity further affected adhesion, proliferation, and migration behavior of MSCs. Macromolecular crowding can thus aid the design of more physiologically relevant in vitro studies and devices for MSCs and other cells, by increasing the fidelity between materials synthesized by cells in vivo and in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1999817931,"Background The circadian clock has been linked to reproduction at many levels in mammals. Epidemiological studies of female shift workers have reported increased rates of reproductive abnormalities and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although whether the cause is circadian disruption or another factor associated with shift work is unknown. Here we test whether environmental disruption of circadian rhythms, using repeated shifts of the light:dark (LD) cycle, adversely affects reproductive success in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Young adult female C57BL/6J (B6) mice were paired with B6 males until copulation was verified by visual identification of vaginal plug formation. Females were then randomly assigned to one of three groups: control, phase-delay or phase-advance. Controls remained on a constant 12-hr light:12-hr dark cycle, whereas phase-delayed and phase-advanced mice were subjected to 6-hr delays or advances in the LD cycle every 5–6 days, respectively. The number of copulations resulting in term pregnancies was determined. Control females had a full-term pregnancy success rate of 90% (11/12), which fell to 50% (9/18; p<0.1) in the phase-delay group and 22% (4/18; p<0.01) in the phase-advance group. Conclusions/Significance Repeated shifting of the LD cycle, which disrupts endogenous circadian timekeeping, dramatically reduces pregnancy success in mice. Advances of the LD cycle have a greater negative impact on pregnancy outcomes and, in non-pregnant female mice, require longer for circadian re-entrainment, suggesting that the magnitude or duration of circadian misalignment may be related to the severity of the adverse impact on pregnancy. These results explicitly link disruptions of circadian entrainment to adverse pregnancy outcomes in mammals, which may have important implications for the reproductive health of female shift workers, women with circadian rhythm sleep disorders and/or women with disturbed circadian rhythms for other reasons."
https://openalex.org/W2164511273,"C5a receptors are found in the central nervous system (CNS), on both neurons and glia. However, the origin of the C5a, which activates these receptors, is unclear. In the present study, we show that primary cultured mouse cortical neurons constitutively express C5, the precursor of C5a, and express the classical receptor for C5a, CD88. With cell ischemia caused by 12 h glucose deprivation, or oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), neurons demonstrated increased apoptosis, up-regulation of CD88, and increased levels of C5a in the media. Exogenous murine C5a (100 nM) added to the neuronal cultures resulted in apoptosis, without affecting cell necrosis. Pretreatment of the cells with the specific CD88 receptor antagonist PMX53 (100 nM) significantly blocked ischemia-induced apoptosis (~50%), and neurons from CD88–/– mice were similarly protected. In a murine model of stroke, using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), we found that C5a levels in the brain increased; this also occurred in cerebral slice cultures exposed to OGD. CD88–/– mice subjected to MCAO had significantly reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological scores. Taken together, our results demonstrate that neurons in the CNS have the capability to generate C5a following ischemic stress, and this has the potential to activate their C5a receptors, with deleterious consequences.—Pavlovski, D., Thundyil, J., Monk, P.

https://openalex.org/W2135093278,"The molecular mechanisms by which polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded huntingtin (Htt) causes neurodegeneration in Huntington's disease (HD) remain unclear. The malfunction of cellular proteostasis has been suggested as central in HD pathogenesis and also as a target of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of HD. We present results that offer a previously unexplored perspective regarding impaired proteostasis in HD. We find that, under non-stress conditions, the proteostatic capacity of cells expressing full length polyQ-expanded Htt is adequate. Yet, under stress conditions, the presence of polyQ-expanded Htt impairs the heat shock response, a key component of cellular proteostasis. This impaired heat shock response results in a reduced capacity to withstand the damage caused by cellular stress. We demonstrate that in cells expressing polyQ-expanded Htt the levels of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) are reduced, and, as a consequence, these cells have an impaired a heat shock response. Also, we found reduced HSF1 and HSP70 levels in the striata of HD knock-in mice when compared to wild-type mice. Our results suggests that full length, non-aggregated polyQ-expanded Htt blocks the effective induction of the heat shock response under stress conditions and may thus trigger the accumulation of cellular damage during the course of HD pathogenesis."

We investigated associations between betaine insufficiency and secondary events in acute coronary syndrome patients. Methods Plasma (531) and urine (415) samples were collected four months after discharge following an acute coronary event. Death (34), secondary acute myocardial infarction (MI) (70) and hospital admission for heart failure (45) events were recorded over a median follow-up of 832 days. Principal Findings The highest and lowest quintiles of urinary betaine excretion associated with risk of heart failure (p = 0.0046, p = 0.013 compared with middle 60%) but not with subsequent acute MI. The lowest quintile of plasma betaine was associated with subsequent acute MI (p = 0.014), and the top quintile plasma betaine with heart failure (p = 0.043), especially in patients with diabetes (p<0.001). Top quintile plasma concentrations of dimethylglycine (betaine metabolite) and top quintile plasma homocysteine both associated with all three outcomes, acute MI (p = 0.004, <0.001), heart failure (p = 0.027, p<0.001) and survival (p<0.001, p<0.001). High homocysteine was associated with high or low betaine excretion in >60% of these subjects (p = 0.017). Median NT-proBNP concentrations were lowest in the middle quintile of plasma betaine concentration (p = 0.002). Conclusions Betaine insufficiency indicates increased risk of secondary heart failure and acute MI. Its association with elevated homocysteine may partly explain the disappointing results of folate supplementation. In some patients, especially with diabetes, elevated plasma betaine also indicates increased risk."

https://openalex.org/W2087121094,"South American subterranean rodents (Ctenomys aff. knighti), commonly known as tuco-tucos, display nocturnal, wheel-running behavior under light-dark (LD) conditions, and free-running periods >24 h in constant darkness (DD). However, several reports in the field suggested that a substantial amount of activity occurs during daylight hours, leading us to question whether circadian entrainment in the laboratory accurately reflects behavior in natural conditions. We compared circadian patterns of locomotor activity in DD of animals previously entrained to full laboratory LD cycles (LD12:12) with those of animals that were trapped directly from the field. In both cases, activity onsets in DD immediately reflected the previous dark onset or sundown. Furthermore, freerunning periods upon release into DD were close to 24 h indicating aftereffects of prior entrainment, similarly in both conditions. No difference was detected in the phase of activity measured with and without access to a running wheel. However, when individuals were observed continuously during daylight hours in a semi-natural enclosure, they emerged above-ground on a daily basis. These day-time activities consisted of foraging and burrow maintenance, suggesting that the designation of this species as nocturnal might be inaccurate in the field. Our study of a solitary subterranean species suggests that the circadian clock is entrained similarly under field and laboratory conditions and that day-time activity expressed only in the field is required for foraging and may not be time-dictated by the circadian pacemaker."
https://openalex.org/W2008730138,"Negative regulation of the NF-κB transcription factor is essential for tissue homeostasis in response to stress and inflammation. NF-κB activity is regulated by a variety of biochemical mechanisms including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. In this study, we provide the first experimental evidence that NF-κB is regulated by SUMOylation, where the RelA subunit of NF-κB is SUMOylated by PIAS3, a member of the PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) protein family with E3 SUMO ligase activity. PIAS3-mediated NF-κB repression was compromised by either RelA mutant resistant to SUMOylation or PIAS3 mutant defective in SUMOylation. PIAS3-mediated SUMOylation of endogenous RelA was induced by NF-κB activation thus forming a negative regulatory loop. The SUMOylation of endogenous RelA was enhanced in IκBα null as compared with wild type fibroblasts. The RelA SUMOylation was induced by TNFα but not leptomycin B mediated RelA nuclear translocation. Furthermore, RelA mutants defective in DNA binding were not SUMOylated by PIAS3, suggesting that RelA DNA binding is a signal for PIAS3-mediated SUMOylation. These results support a novel negative feedback mechanism for NF-κB regulation by PIAS3-mediated RelA SUMOylation."

Although, two major isoforms of sulfatide, C16:0 and C24:0, are enriched in the pancreas, their relative role in autoimmune diabetes is not known. Here, we report that sulfatide/CD1d-tetramer(+) cells accumulate in the draining pancreatic lymph nodes, and that treatment of NOD mice with sulfatide or C24:0 was more efficient than C16:0 in stimulating the NKT cell-mediated transfer of a delay in onset from T1D into NOD.Scid recipients. Using NOD.CD1d(-/-) mice, we show that this delay of T1D is CD1d-dependent. Interestingly, the latter delay or protection from T1D is associated with the enhanced secretion of IL-10 rather than IFN-g by C24:0-treated CD4(+) T cells and the deviation of the islet-reactive diabetogenic T cell response. Both C16:0 and C24:0 sulfatide isoforms are unable to activate and expand type I iNKT cells. Collectively, these data suggest that C24:0 stimulated type II NKT cells may regulate protection from T1D by activating DCs to secrete IL-10 and suppress the activation and expansion of type I iNKT cells and diabetogenic T cells. Our results raise the possibility that C24:0 may be used therapeutically to delay the onset and protect from T1D in humans."

Recent studies have proposed that α-GalCer is an effective adjuvant in vaccination against a range of immune challenges, however its mechanism of action has not been completely elucidated. A variety of delivery methods have been examined including pulsing dendritic cells with α-GalCer to optimize the potential of α-GalCer. These methods are currently being used in a variety of clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer but cannot be used in the context of vaccine development against pathogens due to their complexity. Using a simple delivery method, we evaluated α-GalCer adjuvant properties, using the mouse model for cytomegalovirus (MCMV). We measured several key parameters of the immune response to MCMV, including inflammation, effector, and central memory CD8+ T cell responses. We found that α-GalCer injection at the time of the infection decreases viral titers, alters the kinetics of the inflammatory response, and promotes both increased frequencies and numbers of virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells. Overall, our data suggest that iNKT cell activation by α-GalCer promotes the development of long-term protective immunity through increased fitness of central memory CD8+ T cells, as a consequence of reduced inflammation."

Biopsies were snap-frozen or cultured with DNA from Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) or Salmonella dublin (SD). Gene expression was analyzed under basal conditions and in response to DNA. Gene networks were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways software. Mucosal-associated microbiota was analyzed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in NOD2 and TLR9 was assessed. Results Patients with IBD had altered microbiota, enhanced expression of inflammatory genes, and increased correlations between specific gene expression and microbes. Principle component analysis showed CD and UC patients to cluster independently from healthy controls in both gene expression and microbial analysis. DNA from LP stimulated anti-inflammatory pathways in controls and UC patients, but induced an upregulation of IL17A in CD patients. There were no differences in SNP frequencies of TLR9 or NOD2 in the groups. Conclusions Patients with Crohn's disease exhibit altered responses to bacterial DNA. These findings suggest that the gut response to bacterial DNA may depend not only on the specific type of bacterial DNA, but also on the host."

Significance: Subcellular localization of Cdk5 and p35 may play roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. The cell division cycle of eukaryotic cells is conventionally divided into four phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 3The abbreviations used are: Cdkcyclin-dependent kinaseNESnuclear export signal. are two key protein families that help determine the pace of progression through these phases. Cyclins function as the regulatory proteins of the proline-directed serine/threonine kinases. They are up- or down-regulated, depending on the phase of the cell cycle, by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In a well-coordinated cell cycle, the timely degradation of cyclin proteins is as important as their synthesis. This degradation is usually mediated by a highly specific ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (1.Peters J.M. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome: a machine designed to destroy.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). cyclin-dependent kinase nuclear export signal. The mammalian Cdk family consists of 10 members: Cdk1 to Cdk9 and Cdk11 (2.Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Mammalian cyclin-dependent kinases.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 630-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Among these Cdks, Cdk5 is regarded as non-traditional. Though its substrate preferences are typical for a Cdk kinase, its activity relies on two specific activator proteins, p35 and p39, not traditional cyclins. These two proteins are structurally similar to cyclins, but share no homology at the amino acid level. Cdk5 is found in many cell types (3.Philpott A. Porro E.B. Kirschner M.W. Tsai L.H.

In addition to the brain, low levels of Cdk5 kinase activity are also present in the adult mouse prostate and embryonic limb buds (8.Zhang Q. Ahuja H.S. Zakeri Z.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is associated with apoptotic cell death during development and tissue remodeling.Dev. Biol. 1997; 183: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The function of Cdk5 has been widely investigated during development where it has a recognized role in the phosphorylation of a variety of cytoskeletal proteins (9.Hosoi T. Uchiyama M. Okumura E. Saito T. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Okuyama A. Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. Evidence for cdk5 as a major activity phosphorylating tau protein in porcine brain extract.J.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2681-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In recent years, additional roles for Cdk5 have been discovered in the post-mitotic neuron. Most of these are related to the ability of Cdk5 to phosphorylate numerous synaptic proteins (11.Cheng K. Ip N.Y. Cdk5: a new player at synapses.Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 12.Fischer A. Sananbenesi F. Spiess J. Radulovic J.

Cdk5 behind the wheel: a role in trafficking and transport?.Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 28-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar); there is no reported linkage of Cdk5 activity with the promotion of a normal cell cycle. Despite its apparent outlier status, however, our laboratory has demonstrated that Cdk5 does play a role in cell cycle regulation. It has an unexpected non-catalytic function of inhibiting rather than advancing the cell cycle in post-mitotic neurons (14.Cicero S. Herrup K. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 is essential for neuronal cell cycle arrest and differentiation.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9658-9668Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further, this newly discovered activity of Cdk5 appears to be neuroprotective since the unscheduled reactivation of neuronal cell cycle activity is closely linked to neurodegenerative disease (15.Nagy Z. Esiri M.M. Cato A.M. Smith A.D. Cell cycle markers in the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease.Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16.Vincent I. Jicha G.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2801-2807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This linkage and the failure of cell cycle suppression in Cdk5 deficiency has led our laboratory to focus on the biochemistry of neuronal cell cycle regulation in post-mitotic neurons. We find that Cdk5 normally prevents neuronal cell cycle re-entry by disrupting the E2F1-DP1 complex, inhibiting its access to the promoters of cell cycle genes (19.Zhang J. Herrup K. Cdk5 and the non-catalytic arrest of the neuronal cell cycle.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 3487-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8772-8777Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21.Zhang J. Li H. Yabut O. Fitzpatrick H. D'Arcangelo G. Herrup K.

Chem. 2010; 285: 14052-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We also find that Cdk5 is a nucleocytoplasmic protein. Its nuclear import depends on its binding the Cdk inhibitor, p27; its nuclear export depends on an endogenous nuclear export signal (NES) and the activity of CRM1. This nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is tightly correlated with the cell cycle. Cdk5 moves to the cytoplasm either during S-phase of a normal cell cycle, or during the DNA replication that occurs when a post-mitotic neuron re-enters the cell cycle (23.Zhang J. Herrup K. Nucleocytoplasmic Cdk5 is involved in neuronal cell cycle and death in post-mitotic neurons.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 1208-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This neuroprotective function, however, contrasts with the finding that Cdk5 hyperactivity, triggered in part by elevated levels of p25 (a breakdown product of p35), is neurotoxic over a timeframe of weeks. Indeed, this toxicity has been proposed as a pathogenic force in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (24.Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates Cdk5 activity and promotes neurodegeneration.Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 25.Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T. Li M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Neurotoxicity induces cleavage of p35 to p25 by calpain.Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, our own short-term studies offered hints that over a timeframe of hours, cytoplasmic Cdk5 is neuroprotective (22.Zhang J. Li H. Herrup K. Cdk5 nuclear localization is p27-dependent in nerve cells: implications for cell cycle suppression and caspase-3 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14052-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26.O'Hare M.J. Kushwaha N. Zhang Y. Aleyasin H. Callaghan S.M. Slack R.S. Albert P.R. Vincent I. Park D.S. Differential roles of nuclear and cytoplasmic cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in apoptotic and excitotoxic neuronal death.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 8954-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This discrepancy led us to an interest in the fate of Cdk5 once it moved to the neuronal cytoplasm. In the current study we show that cytoplasmic Cdk5 is an unstable protein and that its stability is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. We suggest that the failure of this normal clearance pathway would worsen the consequence of any elevation of Cdk5 kinase activity and, coupled with the loss of neuronal cell cycle suppression, suggests that Cdk5 plays multiple roles in the pathway leading to neurodegenerative disease. Antibodies against cyclin A, p27, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk6, GFP(B2), GFP(FL), p35(C19), and anti-HA were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat-anti-BrdU, Cdk1, Cdk2, α-tubulin, and ubiquitin antibodies were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were as follows: goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 and 594; goat anti-rat Alexa 488 and 594; goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and 594 (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR). All were used at a dilution of 1:1000. DAPI (4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindol) was used as a nuclear counterstain at 1 μg/ml. MG132, cycloheximide, and nocodazole were from Sigma. DynBeads was from Invitrogen, Inc. β-amyloid1–42 was purchased from American Peptide Company (Sunnyvale, CA), β-amyloid1–42 was aged 5 days at 37 °C before use. GFP-cdk5, GFP-p35, HA-cdk1–9, Cdh1, Cdc20, and Skp2 were purchased from Addgene Inc. GFP-p10 was constructed by inserting a sequence encoding the p10 fragment of Cdk5 in EGFP-C3. All truncated Cdk5 constructs were made as described previously (22.Zhang J. Li H. Herrup K. Cdk5 nuclear localization is p27-dependent in nerve cells: implications for cell cycle suppression and caspase-3 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14052-14061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). N2a (Neuroblastoma 2A) cells were purchased from ATCC. N2a cells were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS. For cell synchronization, 50 ng/ml nocodazole were added to the media for 18 h, following which the cells were washed with fresh media and cultured in normal DMEM. Cells were harvested at different times following removal of nocodazole from the medium. Embryonic cortical neurons were isolated by standard procedures. Isolated C57BL/6J E15.5 embryonic cerebral cortices were treated with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and dissociated into single cells by gentle trituration. Cells were suspended in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 2 mm glutamine, then plated on coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (0.05 mg/ml). All cultures were grown for a minimum of 5 days in vitro (DIV) before any treatment. To assess cell cycle activity, medium was exchanged with fresh medium containing 10 μm BrdU. After 12 h, cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then washed and stored in PBS. All experiments were performed on a minimum of three litters; each condition was examined in triplicate. At the appropriate time, cultures were rinsed once with PBS and then exposed to 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature followed by three rinses with PBS. Immunocytochemistry of cell cultures was done without antigen retrieval. For BrdU labeling, the cells were serum starved for 48 h followed by 12 h of serum add-back. Four hours before the end of the experiment, 10 μm BrdU was added to the media. The cells were then fixed, and DNA was hydrolyzed by exposing the cells to 2 n HCl for 10 min. Specimens were neutralized in 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.6) for 10 min, then rinsed extensively in PBS (3×) for 45 min before treatment with blocking reagent. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by exposing the fixed cells to 5% normal goat serum in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h before application of the primary antibody. Dissected tissues or harvested cells were homogenized in 1:5 (w:v) ice cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl), plus protease inhibitor mix (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The samples were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and total protein levels were measured by a Micro Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). For Western blots, lysates were separated with SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST and probed with primary antibodies in blocking buffer, followed by treatment with HRP-linked secondary antibodies and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce Fisher Scientific). For immunoprecipitation, the protein lysates were first cleaned by incubation with Protein G beads for 30 min at 4 °C, and then the desired antibody was used to precipitate the antigen overnight at 4 °C. After washing with IP buffer, the immunoprecipitated beads were boiled in loading buffer for Western blotting experiments. The intensity of immunoreactive bands was quantified using NIH Image. N2a cells were harvested and washed by PBS. 3 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol was slowly added, dropwise, while vortexing the cells. The suspension was then placed on ice for 30 min, after which the cells were lightly centrifuged (300 × g) for 5 min. The supernatant was then aspirated, and the cells washed with 3 ml of PBS. After ethanol fixation, the cell pellets are loose so extra care was taken at this step not to lose any cells. The cell pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of PBS; 50 μl of RNase A solution and 5 μl of PI (1 mg/ml) were added, and the suspension incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry on a Beckman Coulter FC500 Analyzer. We synchronized N2a cells in G2/M-phase by exposing them to nocodazole for 18 h in culture. After release of the cell cycle by shifting to nocodazole-free medium, cells were harvested at various times for assay. Each sample for each time point was split in two. One aliquot was used for flow cytometry to assess the stage of the cell cycle (Fig. 1A); the second was used for Western blots to determine the levels of various proteins (Fig. 1B). After release, N2a cells passed from M phase into G1 phase; then, at about 13 h, the cells entered S phase This is best seen by noting the levels of the S-phase cyclin, Cyclin A (Fig. 1B, row 2). The levels of the Cdk inhibitor (CKI), p27, mark the G1 phase of the cycle (Fig. 1B, row 3). The protein levels of typical Cdks (Cdk1, Cdk2, Cdk4), remain constant during a cell cycle (Fig. 1B, rows 5–7). Two curiosities appear in these data, however, the increases of Cdk6 11 h after nocodazole release (Fig. 1B, rows 8). It may be that the increased activity of Cdk6 required to promote the cell cycle is achieved in part by an increase in protein levels. Given that it is not normally thought of as participating in the cell cycle, it is unexpected that the Cdk5 protein was substantially down-regulated during S phase 13 h after nocodazole release (Fig. 1B, row 4). We deemed it unlikely that the levels of Cdk5 were regulated by transcription; rather, our data suggest that Cdk5 is an unstable protein whose degradation is enhanced during S-phase of the cell cycle. To investigate this possibility, cycloheximide was used to block new protein synthesis. In this situation, the levels of a protein detected on a Western blot reflect only its rate of degradation. When 5 different Cdk proteins were analyzed in this fashion, only the levels of Cdk5 dropped significantly (Fig. 1C). Quantification of the gels revealed that the Cdk5 half-life is about 2 h under these conditions. Other Cdks such as Cdk1, 2, 4, and 6 were not detectably degraded during the entire 4.5 h of the experiment. To determine whether the loss of Cdk5 during S-phase was regulated by the proteasome, we used MG132 to inhibit proteasomal activity after nocodazole release. As shown in Fig. 1D, the down-regulation of Cdk5 in S phase shown in Fig. 1B was blocked by MG132. In untreated cultures, the Cdk5/actin ratio was reduced to 30% of its initial value by 16 h after nocodazole release by which time the cells were in mid S-phase. In the presence of MG132, however, the Cdk5/actin ratio was unchanged during this time. The data suggest that a coordinated reduction in the levels of Cdk5 is necessary for a cell to enter S phase. This is consistent with our earlier findings (20.Zhang J. Cicero S.A. Wang L. Romito-Digiacomo R.R. Yang Y. Herrup K.

Yang Y. Cell cycle regulation in the postmitotic neuron: oxymoron or new biology?.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Indeed, neuronal cell cycle reactivation has been widely reported in Alzheimer disease (15.Nagy Z. Esiri M.M. Cato A.M. Smith A.D. Cell cycle markers in the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease.Acta Neuropathol. 1997; 94: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 16.Vincent I. Jicha G. Rosado M. Dickson D.W.

Herrup K. Ectopic cell cycle events link human Alzheimer disease and amyloid precursor protein transgenic mouse models.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 775-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As β-amyloid is a potent neurotoxin that is present in the AD brain, and previous reports have shown that it can induce normally post-mitotic neurons to re-enter a cell cycle, we used it to trigger the cell cycle activity of mouse neocortical neurons. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, β-amyloid administration successfully induced neuronal cell cycle reentry. The endogenous Cdk5 level was tracked during this process by the addition of BrdU 12 h before fixing the cultures. (Fig. 2A). We consistently found that the BrdU-positive S-phase neurons (Map2-positive cells) had low overall Cdk5 immunostaining, particularly in the nucleus, while the BrdU negative neurons had strong, predominantly nuclear, Cdk5 staining. Combined with the results from the N2a cells, these data implicate the degradation of Cdk5 as a critical event that precedes neuronal cell cycle activation in both dividing and non-dividing cells. The Cdk5 stability data presented thus far emphasize the importance of degradation in the regulation of Cdk5 protein levels. This suggests that the developmental up-regulation of Cdk5 (30.Frank C.L. Ge X. Xie Z. Zhou Y. Tsai L.H. Control of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) persistence by multisite phosphorylation impacts cell cycle progression and neurogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33324-33337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) might be due to decreased proteasomal degradation. The involvement of the proteasome suggests further that ubiquitination of Cdk5 might be a key regulatory event. To test this idea, we first validated previous reports that during the early stages of normal embryonic brain development, Cdk5 levels are very low but increase substantially as brain maturation proceeds (Fig. 2B). Then we examined the levels of Cdk5 ubiquitination in embryonic (E16) and adult (3-month-old) brain. Fig. 2C shows that, consistent with our hypothesis, Cdk5 was far more strongly ubiquitinated in the early stages of brain development (E16) compared with the adult brain (3 m), suggesting that in embryonic brain, when cell division is active, Cdk5 is highly ubiquitinated, and its protein level is suppressed. To pursue the role of ubiquitination in Cdk regulation, multiple HA-tagged Cdks were co-transfected with GFP-ubiquitin into log-phase N2a cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA, run on Western blots and blotted with GFP. Under these conditions, we detected robust ubiquitination of all Cdks tested (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the ubiquitination of Cdk5 was correlated with the changes in its levels during the cell cycle, Cdk5, and ubiquitin were co-transfected into N2a cells, which were then exposed to nocodazole to establish a G2/M-phase arrest. The nocodazole block was released and, based on the timing established in Fig. 1A, aliquots of cells were harvested in log phase, G2/M phase and S phase. The results show that the ubiquitination of Cdk5 is very low in M phase, but very high during S phase. The p35 protein was used as a positive control to confirm the ubiquitination reaction (Fig. 3B). To investigate where on Cdk5 the ubiquitin moieties were added, we analyzed several constructs encoding variant forms of Cdk5 in which portions of the protein were deleted (Fig. 4A). These vectors were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin, and analyzed as described above. Cdk5 isoforms that were missing the C terminus of the protein, for example Cdk5(1–60) and Cdk5(1–181) could not be ubiquitinated (Fig. 4B). Deletions of the N terminus, Cdk5(13–292) and Cdk5(170–292) were readily ubiquitinated. This places the site of ubiquitination after amino acid 181. The position was refined further by analysis of two additional constructs. Cdk5(212–292), missing most of the N terminus could not be ubiquitinated while Cdk5(1–256) missing only a portion of the C terminus could be ubiquitinated (Fig. 4, A and B). This identifies the site as lying somewhere in the 30 amino acids between leucine 212 and tyrosine 242. The same truncation constructs were then used to validate the role of ubiquitination in regulating Cdk5 stability. We monitored the cellular stability of representative fragments by following their decay in the presence of cycloheximide. In every case, the Cdk5 fragments that our earlier work had determined would be ubiquitinated proved unstable in the absence of new protein synthesis while those that could not be ubiquitinated remained stable up to 6 h (Fig. 4C). Fig. 4D represents a quantification of these results. There are three major ubiquitin E3 ligases that are responsible for cell cycle protein degradation: APCcdc20, APCCdh1, and SCF(skp2). Since Cdk5 was degraded during a specific phase of the cell cycle, we hypothesized that one of these three proteins would mediate its ubiquitination. We transfected expression constructs encoding one of three E3 ligases into N2a cells. Cells were either left untreated or incubated in MG132 to inhibit proteasome activity. In control cells that received no E3 ligase construct (Fig. 5A, pCDNA3.1), proteasome inhibition made little difference in the levels of either endogenous Cdk5 or exogenous GFP-Cdk5. When we overexpressed Cdh1, however, Cdk5 protein levels dropped (both exogenous and endogenous) and this drop was prevented by MG132 (Fig. 5, A and C–D). Neither Cdc20 nor Skp2, by contrast, had any effect on the levels of Cdk5 (Fig. 5, B and C–D). This identifies Cdh1 as the ubiquitin ligase that is most likely responsible for the cell cycle dependent degradation of Cdk5. To validate this point, we repeated the assay using Cdh1 and several of the Cdk5 fragments assayed above. As shown in Fig. 5, E and F, co-transfection of Cdh1 with fragments that were able to be ubiquitinated were unstable, but rescued by MG132. Those fragments that could not be ubiquitinated were insensitive to MG132 administration. Protein ubiquitination requires the binding of the ubiquitin ligase to the target protein. Nuclear Cdk5 exists in a 4-protein complex with p35, E2F1 and p27 (21.Zhang J. Li H. Yabut O. Fitzpatrick H. D'Arcangelo G. Herrup K. Cdk5 suppresses the neuronal cell cycle by disrupting the E2F1-DP1 complex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5219-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22.Zhang J. Li H. Herrup K.

We wondered, therefore, whether the formation of this complex would affect the ubiquitination of Cdk5 or other Cdks. To test this hypothesis, HA-Cdks were co-transfected with p35 and GFP-Ub. The ubiquitinations of the Cdks were detected as described above. In the presence of p35, the ubiquitination of Cdk1 and Cdk5 was significantly reduced compared with the IgG control (Fig. 6A; compare also with Fig. 3A). The ubiquitination of other Cdks, such as Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk9 were not affected by p35. Previous work has shown that p35 is an unstable protein; in neurons under stress it can be cleaved into two smaller proteins: p25 and p10. Little is known about the functions, if any, of p10. The p25 fragment, however, has been suggested to stabilize Cdk5 and result in its hyperactivation (24.Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Conversion of p35 to p25 deregulates Cdk5 activity and promotes neurodegeneration.Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 31.Cruz J.C. Kim D. Moy L.Y. Dobbin M.M.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 10536-10541Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that p25 might also be capable of inhibiting Cdk5 ubiquitination. The outcome of this experiment would also serve as a test of whether the larger E2F1/p27/p35 complex was involved since p25 is incapable of driving its formation (21.Zhang J. Li H. Yabut O. Fitzpatrick H. D'Arcangelo G. Herrup K. Cdk5 suppresses the neuronal cell cycle by disrupting the E2F1-DP1 complex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 5219-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We used N2a cells to overexpress p25, p10, or ΔP35, a mutant form of p35 that lacks the Cdk5 binding domain. We then repeated the ubiquitination experiment illustrated in Fig. 3A. As shown in Fig. 6B, p25 can potently inhibit Cdk5 ubiquitination while p10 cannot. The ΔP35, which cannot bind with Cdk5, also cannot suppress the ubiquitination of Cdk5. That Cdh1 is the E3 ligase for the degradation of Cdk5 (Fig. 5) raises the question of whether p25/p35 can block the interaction between Cdk5 with Cdh1. GFP-Cdk5/HA-cdh1 were overexpressed in the presence of extra p25, p35, p10, or control GFP. As shown in Fig. 6C, extra p25, and p35 significantly reduced the physical interaction between Cdk5 and Cdh1. The Cdk5 C-terminal fragment Cdk5(212–292) cannot bind p35 (data not shown), but it can be ubiquitinated (Fig. 4). In keeping with this, we found that Cdk5(212–292) was unstable, and its degradation was not affected by overexpression of either p25 or p35. Overexpression of Δp35, or p39 had no effect on the stability of Cdk5(212–292) (Fig. 7, A–C). In contrast, the Cdk5 N-terminal fragment (Cdk5 1–256) can also bind p35 and p25, and it is also ubiquitinated. As predicted, therefore, p25 or p35 can significantly block the degradation of Cdk5(1–256). The degradation of Cdk(1–256) is slower in the pr"
https://openalex.org/W1963482273,"An important process for the regulation of auxin levels in plants is the inactivation of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) by conjugation to amino acids. The conjugation reaction is catalysed by IAA-amido synthetases belonging to the family of GH3 proteins. Genetic approaches to study the biological significance of these enzymes have been hampered by large gene numbers and a high degree of functional redundancy. To overcome these difficulties a chemical approach based on the reaction mechanism of GH3 proteins was employed to design a small molecule inhibitor of IAA-amido synthetase activity. Adenosine-5′-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]phosphate (AIEP) mimics the adenylated intermediate of the IAA-conjugation reaction and was therefore proposed to compete with the binding of MgATP and IAA in the initial stages of catalysis. Two grapevine IAA-amido synthetases with different catalytic properties were chosen to test the inhibitory effects of AIEP in vitro. GH3-1 has previously been implicated in the grape berry ripening process and is restricted to two amino acid substrates, whereas GH3-6 conjugated IAA to 13 amino acids. AIEP is the most potent inhibitor of GH3 enzymes so far described and was shown to be competitive against MgATP and IAA binding to both enzymes with Ki-values 17-68-fold lower than the respective Km-values. AIEP also exhibited in vivo activity in an ex planta test system using young grape berries. Exposure to 5–20 µM of the inhibitor led to decreased levels of the common conjugate IAA-Asp and reduced the accumulation of the corresponding Asp-conjugate upon treatment with a synthetic auxin. AIEP therefore represents a novel chemical probe with which to study IAA-amido synthetase function."
https://openalex.org/W2138135106,"The resolution of acute inflammation is hallmarked by the apoptotic death of inflammatory polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells, followed by their clearance by macrophages. In turn, resolution-phase macrophages exert reduced proinflammatory cytokine production, termed immune silencing. In this study, we found that the atypical chemokine receptor D6 plays an important and chemokine scavenging-independent role in promoting macrophage-mediated resolution. D6–/– mice displayed increased numbers of macrophages (2.2-fold increase), but not neutrophils, in their peritonea during the resolution of murine zymosan A-initiated peritonitis, in comparison to D6+/+ animals. Moreover, D6-deficient macrophages engulfed higher numbers of apoptotic PMN cells in vivo (1.6-fold increase), and secreted higher amounts of TNF-α, CCL3, and CCL5 ex vivo than their wild-type (WT) counterparts. In addition, D6 was found to be expressed on apoptotic neutrophils from healthy humans and rodents. Moreover, the immune silencing of LPS-stimulated macrophages following their incubation with senescent PMN cells ex vivo (in terms of TNF-α, IL-1β, and CCL5 secretion) was diminished (50–65% decrease) when D6–/– PMN cells were applied. Accordingly, the adhesive responses induced by macrophage interactions with senescent PMN cells were reduced with D6-deficient PMN cells. Thus, our results indicate a novel mode of action for D6 during the resolution of inflammation that is instrumental to the shaping of resolving macrophage phenotypes and the completion of resolution.—Pashover-Schallinger, E., Aswad, M., Schif-Zuck, S., Shapiro, H., Singer, P., Ariel, A.

https://openalex.org/W2141639341,"The type III secretion system (T3SS) is essential in the pathogenesis of many bacteria. The inner rod is important in the assembly of the T3SS needle complex. However, the atomic structure of the inner rod protein is currently unknown. Based on computational methods, others have suggested that the Salmonella inner rod protein PrgJ is highly helical, forming a folded 3 helix structure. Here we show by CD and NMR spectroscopy that the monomeric form of PrgJ lacks a tertiary structure, and the only well-structured part of PrgJ is a short α-helix at the C-terminal region from residues 65-82. Disruption of this helix by glycine or proline mutation resulted in defective assembly of the needle complex, rendering bacteria incapable of secreting effector proteins. Likewise, CD and NMR data for the Shigella inner rod protein MxiI indicate this protein lacks a tertiary structure as well. Our results reveal that the monomeric forms of the T3SS inner rod proteins are partially folded."

Bioinformatic analysis of SHIP1 from multiple species revealed a pleckstrin homololgy-related (PH-R) domain, which we hypothesize mediates SHIP1′s association with the membrane, a requirement for its biological function. Recombinant murine SHIP1 PH-R domain was subjected to biophysical and biochemical analysis. Residues K370 and K397 were found to be important for PH-R domain association with membrane PIP3. Wild-type PH-R domain bound PIP3 with 1.9 ± 0.2 nM affinity, while the affinity of a K370A/K397A substituted mutant was too low to measure. Wild-type (but not the K370A/K397A substituted) full-length SHIP1 protein, reconstitutes normal inhibition of Fcγ receptor-mediated phagocytosis when introduced into SHIP1−/− murine macrophages, reducing the number of phagocytic events by 2-fold as compared to SHIP1−/− cells. In fact, the PH-R-mediated membrane interaction appears to be a major mechanism by which SHIP1 is recruited to the membrane, since the K370A/K397A substitution reduced the recruitment of both full-length SHIP1 and the PH-R domain by ≥2-fold. We have previously shown that SHIP1 enzyme activity can be targeted for therapeutic purposes. The current studies suggest that molecules targeting the PH-R domain can also modulate SHIP1 function.—Ming-Lum, A., Shojania, S., So, E., McCarrell, E., Shaw, E., Vu, D., Wang, I., McIntosh, L.

https://openalex.org/W2003323005,"Background Cell migration is a highly regulated process that involves the formation and turnover of cell-matrix contact sites termed focal adhesions. Rho-family GTPases are molecular switches that regulate actin and focal adhesion dynamics in cells. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate Rho-family GTPases. Rgnef (p190RhoGEF) is a ubiquitous 190 kDa GEF implicated in the control of colon carcinoma and fibroblast cell motility. Principal Findings Rgnef exon 24 floxed mice (Rgnefflox) were created and crossed with cytomegalovirus (CMV)-driven Cre recombinase transgenic mice to inactivate Rgnef expression in all tissues during early development. Heterozygous RgnefWT/flox (Cre+) crosses yielded normal Mendelian ratios at embryonic day 13.5, but Rgnefflox/flox (Cre+) mice numbers at 3 weeks of age were significantly less than expected. Rgnefflox/flox (Cre+) (Rgnef−/−) embryos and primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated and verified to lack Rgnef protein expression. When compared to wildtype (WT) littermate MEFs, loss of Rgnef significantly inhibited haptotaxis migration, wound closure motility, focal adhesion number, and RhoA GTPase activation after fibronectin-integrin stimulation. In WT MEFs, Rgnef activation occurs within 60 minutes upon fibronectin plating of cells associated with RhoA activation. Rgnef−/− MEF phenotypes were rescued by epitope-tagged Rgnef re-expression. Conclusions Rgnef−/− MEF phenotypes were due to Rgnef loss and support an essential role for Rgnef in RhoA regulation downstream of integrins in control of cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2048043146,"Topiramate is an antiepileptic drug known to ameliorate insulin resistance besides reducing body weight. Albeit liver plays a fundamental role in regulation of overall insulin resistance, yet the effect of topiramate on this organ is controversial and is not fully investigated. The current work aimed to study the potential hepatic molecular mechanistic cassette of the anti-insulin resistance effect of topiramate. To this end, male Wistar rats were fed high fat/high fructose diet (HFFD) for 10 weeks to induce obese, insulin resistant, hyperglycemic animals, but with no overt diabetes. Two HFFD-groups received oral topiramate, 40 or 100 mg/kg, for two weeks. Topiramate, on the hepatic molecular level, has opposed the high fat/high fructose diet effect, where it significantly increased adiponectin receptors, GLUT2, and tyrosine kinase activity, while decreased insulin receptor isoforms. Besides, it improved the altered glucose homeostasis and lipid profile, lowered the ALT level, caused subtle, yet significant decrease in TNF-α, and boosted adiponectin in a dose dependent manner. Moreover, topiramate decreased liver weight/, visceral fat weight/, and epididymal fat weight/body weight ratios. The study proved that insulin-resistance has an effect on hepatic molecular level and that the topiramate-mediated insulin sensitivity is ensued partly by modulation of hepatic insulin receptor isoforms, activation of tyrosine kinase, induction of GLUT2 and elevation of adiponectin receptors, as well as their ligand, adiponectin, besides its known improving effect on glucose tolerance and lipid homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W2073976590,"The homothallic ascomycete fungus Gibberella zeae is a plant pathogen that is found worldwide, causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) in cereal crops and ear rot of maize. Ascospores formed in fruiting bodies (i.e., perithecia) are hypothesized to be the primary inocula for FHB disease. Perithecium development is a complex cellular differentiation process controlled by many developmentally regulated genes. In this study, we selected a previously reported putative transcription factor containing the Myb DNA-binding domain MYT2 for an in-depth study on sexual development. The deletion of MYT2 resulted in a larger perithecium, while its overexpression resulted in a smaller perithecium when compared to the wild-type strain. These data suggest that MYT2 regulates perithecium size differentiation. MYT2 overexpression affected pleiotropic phenotypes including vegetative growth, conidia production, virulence, and mycotoxin production. Nuclear localization of the MYT2 protein supports its role as a transcriptional regulator. Transcriptional analyses of trichothecene synthetic genes suggest that MYT2 additionally functions as a suppressor for trichothecene production. This is the first study characterizing a transcription factor required for perithecium size differentiation in G. zeae, and it provides a novel angle for understanding sexual development in filamentous fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2084433606,"The testis specific X-linked genes whose evolution is traced here in the melanogaster species subgroup are thought to undergo fast rate of diversification. The CK2ßtes and NACβtes gene families encode the diverged regulatory β-subunits of protein kinase CK2 and the homologs of β-subunit of nascent peptide associated complex, respectively. We annotated the CK2βtes-like genes related to CK2ßtes family in the D. simulans and D. sechellia genomes. The ancestor CK2βtes-like genes preserved in D. simulans and D. sechellia are considered to be intermediates in the emergence of the D. melanogaster specific Stellate genes related to the CK2ßtes family. The CK2ßtes-like genes are more similar to the unique autosomal CK2ßtes gene than to Stellates, taking into account their peculiarities of polymorphism. The formation of a variant the CK2ßtes gene Stellate in D. melanogaster as a result of illegitimate recombination between a NACßtes promoter and a distinct polymorphic variant of CK2ßtes-like ancestor copy was traced. We found a close nonrandom proximity between the dispersed defective copies of DINE-1 transposons, the members of Helitron family, and the CK2βtes and NACβtes genes, suggesting an involvement of DINE-1 elements in duplication and amplification of these genes."

Tibialis anterior muscle injury was conducted by cardiotoxin (CTX) injection. Bone marrow transplantation and glucocorticoid treatment were performed to manipulate the immune system of the mice.Muscle regeneration was accelerated in STAT1-/- mice after CTX injury. Bone marrow transplantation experiments showed that the regeneration process relied on the type of donor mice rather than on recipient mice. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNFα and IL-1β, were significantly higher in STAT1-/- mice at 1 day and/or 2 days post-injury, while levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, were lower in STAT1-/- mice at 2 days and 3 days post-injury. Levels of IGF-1 were significantly higher in the STAT1-/- mice at 1 day and 2 days post-injury.

https://openalex.org/W2031410713,"Background Dopamine plays an important role in orienting, response anticipation and movement evaluation. Thus, we examined the influence of functional variants related to dopamine inactivation in the dopamine transporter (DAT1) and catechol-O-methyltransferase genes (COMT) on the time-course of motor processing in a contingent negative variation (CNV) task. Methods 64-channel EEG recordings were obtained from 195 healthy adolescents of a community-based sample during a continuous performance task (A-X version). Early and late CNV as well as motor postimperative negative variation were assessed. Adolescents were genotyped for the COMT Val158Met and two DAT1 polymorphisms (variable number tandem repeats in the 3′-untranslated region and in intron 8). Results The results revealed a significant interaction between COMT and DAT1, indicating that COMT exerted stronger effects on lateralized motor post-processing (centro-parietal motor postimperative negative variation) in homozygous carriers of a DAT1 haplotype increasing DAT1 expression. Source analysis showed that the time interval 500–1000 ms after the motor response was specifically affected in contrast to preceding movement anticipation and programming stages, which were not altered. Conclusions Motor slow negative waves allow the genomic imaging of dopamine inactivation effects on cortical motor post-processing during response evaluation. This is the first report to point towards epistatic effects in the motor system during response evaluation, i.e. during the post-processing of an already executed movement rather than during movement programming."
https://openalex.org/W1995286772,"Background Specific isoniazid (INH) resistance conferring mutations have been shown to impact the likelihood of tuberculosis (TB) transmission. However, their role in the clinical presentation and outcomes of TB has not been evaluated. Methods We included all cases of culture-confirmed, INH monoresistant tuberculosis reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health Tuberculosis Control Section from October 1992 through October 2005. For cases with stored culture isolates, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and gene sequencing to identify INH resistance-conferring mutations, and compared genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Results Among 101 consecutive cases of INH monoresistant TB in San Francisco 19 (19%) had isolates with a katG mutation other than S315T; 38 (38%) had isolates with the katG S315T mutation, 29 (29%) had isolates with a inhA-15;c-t promoter mutation, and 15 (15%) had isolates with other mutations. The katG S315T mutation was independently associated with high-level INH resistance (risk ratio [RR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07–2.27), and the inhA-15;c-t promoter mutation was inversely associated with high-level INH resistance (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21–0.89). However, specific INH resistance-conferring mutations were not associated with the clinical severity or outcomes of INH monoresistant TB cases. Conclusion These data suggest that INH resistance-conferring mutations do not impact the clinical presentation of TB."
https://openalex.org/W1987741126,"T helper 2 (Th2) cells play a central role in the progression of many diseases such as allergic airway inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Consequently, animals such as BALB/c mice, which exhibit a propensity for generating Th2 responses, are susceptible to allergic airway inflammation, type-II autoimmune diseases, and various infections induced by intracellular pathogens, namely, Leishmania. In contrast, C3H/OuJ mice have a tendency for generating T helper 1 (Th1) responses and show resistance to these diseases. Here, we show that prostaglandin endoperoxide E(2) selectively inhibits activation-induced cell death of Th2 cells by signaling through its receptor E-prostanoid receptor 2 (EP2). Consequently, Th2 cells derived from BALB/c mice expressed very high levels of EP2. On the other hand, Th2 cells derived from C3H/OuJ mice expressed very low levels of EP2, which failed to support the survival of Th2 cells. Furthermore, we found that this effect of EP2 on Th2 cells from BALB/c mice was executed by a granzyme B-mediated mechanism. EP2 belongs to a group of G-protein-coupled receptors that are amenable to therapeutic targeting. Our findings therefore identify EP2 as a promising target for small molecule-directed immunomodulation."
