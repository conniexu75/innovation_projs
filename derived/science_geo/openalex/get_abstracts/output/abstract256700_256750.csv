https://openalex.org/W1985854434,"Against a backdrop of rising global surface temperature, the stability of the Indian monsoon rainfall over the past century has been a puzzle. By using a daily rainfall data set, we show (i) significant rising trends in the frequency and the magnitude of extreme rain events and (ii) a significant decreasing trend in the frequency of moderate events over central India during the monsoon seasons from 1951 to 2000. The seasonal mean rainfall does not show a significant trend, because the contribution from increasing heavy events is offset by decreasing moderate events. A substantial increase in hazards related to heavy rain is expected over central India in the future."
https://openalex.org/W1979400866,"We describe a transgenesis platform for Drosophila melanogaster that integrates three recently developed technologies: a conditionally amplifiable bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), recombineering, and bacteriophage ΦC31–mediated transgenesis. The BAC is maintained at low copy number, facilitating plasmid maintenance and recombineering, but is induced to high copy number for plasmid isolation. Recombineering allows gap repair and mutagenesis in bacteria. Gap repair efficiently retrieves DNA fragments up to 133 kilobases long from P1 or BAC clones. ΦC31-mediated transgenesis integrates these large DNA fragments at specific sites in the genome, allowing the rescue of lethal mutations in the corresponding genes. This transgenesis platform should greatly facilitate structure/function analyses of most Drosophila genes."

However, it remains nontrivial to discover the identities of environmental bacteria carrying two or more genes of interest. We have used microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify and analyze multiple, different genes obtained from single bacterial cells harvested from nature. A gene encoding a key enzyme involved in the mutualistic symbiosis occurring between termites and their gut microbiota was used as an experimental hook to discover the previously unknown ribosomal RNA–based species identity of several symbionts. The ability to systematically identify bacteria carrying a particular gene and to link any two or more genes of interest to single species residing in complex ecosystems opens up new opportunities for research on the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2107987521,"Old-growth forests have traditionally been considered negligible as carbon sinks because carbon uptake has been thought to be balanced by respiration. We show that the top 20-centimeter soil layer in preserved old-growth forests in southern China accumulated atmospheric carbon at an unexpectedly high average rate of 0.61 megagrams of carbon hectare-1 year-1 from 1979 to 2003. This study suggests that the carbon cycle processes in the belowground system of these forests are changing in response to the changing environment. The result directly challenges the prevailing belief in ecosystem ecology regarding carbon budget in old-growth forests and supports the establishment of a new, nonequilibrium conceptual framework to study soil carbon dynamics"
https://openalex.org/W2092574457,"We report on the very-low-frequency earthquakes occurring in the transition zone of the subducting plate interface along the Nankai subduction zone in southwest Japan. Seismic waves generated by very-low-frequency earthquakes with seismic moment magnitudes of 3.1 to 3.5 predominantly show a long period of about 20 seconds. The seismicity of very-low-frequency earthquakes accompanies and migrates with the activity of deep low-frequency tremors and slow slip events. The coincidence of these three phenomena improves the detection and characterization of slow earthquakes, which are thought to increase the stress on updip megathrust earthquake rupture zones."
https://openalex.org/W2020358480,"The use of bottom-up approaches to construct patterned surfaces for technological applications is appealing, but to date is applicable to only relatively small areas (approximately 10 square micrometers). We constructed highly periodic patterns at macroscopic length scales, in the range of square millimeters, by combining self-assembly of disk-like porphyrin dyes with physical dewetting phenomena. The patterns consisted of equidistant 5-nanometer-wide lines spaced 0.5 to 1 micrometers apart, forming single porphyrin stacks containing millions of molecules, and were formed spontaneously upon drop-casting a solution of the molecules onto a mica surface. On glass, thicker lines are formed, which can be used to align liquid crystals in large domains of square millimeter size."
https://openalex.org/W2063169494,"Women with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 are predisposed to breast and ovarian cancers. Why the BRCA1 protein suppresses tumor development specifically in ovarian hormone–sensitive tissues remains unclear. We demonstrate that mammary glands of nulliparous Brca1 / p53 -deficient mice accumulate lateral branches and undergo extensive alveologenesis, a phenotype that occurs only during pregnancy in wild-type mice. Progesterone receptors, but not estrogen receptors, are overexpressed in the mutant mammary epithelial cells because of a defect in their degradation by the proteasome pathway. Treatment of Brca1 / p53 -deficient mice with the progesterone antagonist mifepristone (RU 486) prevented mammary tumorigenesis. These findings reveal a tissue-specific function for the BRCA1 protein and raise the possibility that antiprogesterone treatment may be useful for breast cancerpreventioninindividuals with BRCA1 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2120578666,"According to theory, homoploid hybrid speciation, which is hybrid speciation without a change in chromosome number, is facilitated by adaptation to a novel or extreme habitat. Using molecular and ecological data, we found that the alpine-adapted butterflies in the genus Lycaeides are the product of hybrid speciation. The alpine populations possess a mosaic genome derived from both L. melissa and L. idas and are differentiated from and younger than their putative parental species. As predicted, adaptive traits may allow for persistence in the environmentally extreme alpine habitat and reproductively isolate these populations from their parental species."

Here we have determined the histone methyl-lysine binding activity of the PHD fingers present within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome.

Together, our study suggests that a common function for PHD fingers is to transduce methyl-lysine events and sheds light on how a single histone modification can be linked to multiple biological outcomes. One of the major mechanisms for regulating chromatin structure involves the reversible covalent post-translational modification of histone proteins by chemical moieties such as acetyl, methyl, and phospho groups (1Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 2Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Different histone modifications are linked to discrete chromatin states and are thought to regulate the extent of accessibility of DNA to transacting factors. In this context, the proteins and domains that recognize histone modification, named “effectors,” are thought to define the functional consequences of specific modifications by transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological outcomes (3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggested that evolutionally conserved domains commonly found within chromatin regulatory proteins, such as the bromo-domain and chromodomain, function as such effectors (4de la Cruz X. Lois S. Sanchez-Molina S. Martinez-Balbas M.A. BioEssays. 2005; 27: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Daniel J.A. Pray-Grant M.G. Grant P.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The PHD finger (plant homeodomain) is a signature chromatin-associated domain that is found throughout eukaryotic proteomes. Accordingly, the PHD fingers from the ING2 and BPTF proteins were recently demonstrated to be highly specific effectors of histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) (6Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L.

However, contrary to this hypothesis, a number of other PHD fingers either bind to nucleosomes in a manner independent of post-translational modifications or have no detectable histone binding activity (6Shi X.

To obtain a genomic scale understanding of PHD finger function, here we have determined the histone methyl-lysine binding activity of the PHD fingers present within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. Our study identifies either H3K4me3 or H3K36me3 recognition as an activity common to the majority of yeast PHD fingers, arguing that a general function for this domain is to transduce lysine methylation events. Peptide Synthesis and Cloning—Biotinylated histone peptides were synthesized as described previously (6Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R.

Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), using either 150 or 300 mm NaCl as indicated. Tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy experiments to determine the dissociation constants (Kd values) of PHD finger interactions were performed as described previously (10Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Peptide Microarray—Biotinylated histone peptides were printed in triplicates onto a streptavidin-coated slide (ArrayIt) using a VersArray Compact Microarrayer (Bio-Rad). After a short blocking with biotin (Sigma), the slides were incubated with the GST-fused PHD fingers in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% fetal bovine serum) for overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After washing with the same buffer, slides were probed with anti-GST antibody and then fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with GenePix 4000 scanner (Molecular Devices). Protein Microarray—Protein microarrays were generated essentially as described previously (11Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.25 μg of GST fusion proteins with PHD fingers from S. cerevisiae were spotted in duplicates onto a glass slide precoated with nitrocellulose polymer (Schleicher & Schuell) using a FLEXYS® robot (Genomic Solutions). After blocking, the arrayed slides were incubated with Cy3-labeled histone peptides and the fluorescent signal detected using a GeneTAC™ LSIV scanner (Genomic Solutions). The arrays were also probed with an anti-GST antibody to control for loading. In Silico Analysis of Functions and Interactions of PHD Finger-containing Proteins in S. cerevisiae—PHD finger proteins were assigned functions and scored as interactors with Set1, Set2, and Dot1 based on 1) BioGRID data base searches, 2) Saccharomyces Genome Data base searches, and 3) the presence of domains with characterized enzymatic activity. Molecular Modeling of PHD Fingers—Homology models of PHD fingers with and without bound peptides were built with MODELER (12Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) (Ecm5(PHD), Cti6(PHD), and Nto1(PHD)) or with SWISSMODEL (13Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar) (Yng1(PHD), Yng2(PHD), and Pho23(PHD) and Spp1(PHD), Set3(PHD), and Set4(PHD)) using structures of ING2 and BPTF PHD domains (Protein Data Bank IDs: 2G6Q and 2F6N, respectively) as templates. The conformation of the side chains were predicted by SCWRL3 algorithm (14Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar) except for residues that coordinate metal ions, where the original conformers were kept. Glide docking algorithm (15Friesner R.A. Banks J.L. Murphy R.B. Halgren T.A. Klicic J.J. Mainz D.T. Repasky M.P. Knoll E.H. Shelley M. Perry J.K. Shaw D.E. Francis P. Shenkin P.S. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 1739-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (6462) Google Scholar) was used to establish the binding modes of H3(33–38)K36me peptide to Emc5(PHD). The models were analyzed using PyMOL visualization software (16DeLano W.L. PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific LLC, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). In contrast to the human epigenome where abundant potential methylation sites exist, the S. cerevisiae epigenome is suitable for a genomic scale analysis, as it is thought to contain only three methylated lysine residues: H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79. SMART and Pfam data base searches of the S. cerevisiae genome revealed a total of 18 canonical and non-canonical PHD fingers, present within 14 proteins (Table 1). Virtually all these proteins are nuclear proteins with known or candidate chromatin-regulatory functions, including histone demethylases (Jhd1, Ecm5, and Yj89), histone methyltransferases, and associated proteins (Set3, Set4, and Spp1) modulators of histone acetylation (Cti6, Nto1, Pho23, Rco1, Yng1, and Yng2), and transcriptional regulators (Bye1) (see Table 1). To screen these PHD fingers for histone methyl-lysine binding activity, histone peptide microarrays containing methylated histone peptides or the corresponding unmodified control peptide were probed with PHD fingers fused to GST (Fig. 1A). In agreement with previous work, this analysis revealed strong binding to H3K4me2/3 peptides for the PHD fingers from the three yeast ING2 family members, Yng1, Yng2, and Pho23 (Fig. 1A) (6Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 10Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G.

Biol. 2006; 26: 7871-7879Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, novel interactions were detected between methylated H3K4 and the PHD fingers from Bye1, Cti6, Jhd1, Set3, and Spp1 (Fig. 1A). A second screening strategy, in which protein microarrays containing the recombinant GST PHD domains were probed with the histone peptides, detected the three yeast ING proteins but weakly or not at all for the other PHD fingers (Fig. 1B) (11Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This difference argues that the peptide microarray is more sensitive assay than the protein microarray for screening purposes, possibly due to the difficulty of recombinant PHD fingers properly folding during the printing process (Fig. 1; data not shown). Using both assays, no interactions were detected with methylated Lys36 or Lys79 peptides (Fig. 1A; data not shown). To validate the binding data by a third method that in our experience has proven more sensitive, 5X. Shi and O. Gozani, unpublished observations. in vitro binding assays with biotinylated unmodified and methylated histone peptides were employed (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the data obtained with the protein microarray studies, the PHD fingers of Yng1, Yng2, Pho23, Bye1, Cti6, Jhd1, Set3, and Spp1 were all found to bind specifically to H3K4me, with no binding to K36me or K79me peptides observed (Fig. 2a; for disassociation constants see Fig. 2c). Moreover, a preference for binding to the trimethylated species versus lower methylation species was observed for all PHD fingers apart from Spp1 (Fig. 2A). No further PHD finger in the yeast proteome bound to H3K4me. Based on these data, we conclude that 8 of the 14 proteins that contain PHD fingers in the S. cerevisiae proteome (8 of 18 PHD fingers) possess H3K4me recognition activity and are thus novel candidate effector domains for this modification (Table 1). The PHD fingers that failed to bind H3K4me were also tested for H3K36me and H3K79me recognition activity. Notably, a number of PHD fingers bound weakly to H3K36me, with the PHD finger from the putative histone demethylase Ecm5, and a PHD finger present within the NuA3-associated protein Nto1, binding best to H3K36me3 (Fig. 2B). These interactions were confirmed by tryptophan fluorescence experiments and disassociation constants determined (Fig. 2C). The inability to detect H3K36me-binding by the Ecm5 and Nto1 PHD fingers using microarray screening (see Fig. 1) indicates that the threshold for detection using these methodologies requires Kd values < 100 μm (Fig. 2C). A number of additional PHD fingers present within different proteins bound to methylated and unmethylated histone peptides but without significant affinity for a specific ligand (Fig. 2b). Thus, 10 of 18 yeast PHD fingers show methyllysine binding activity (Table 1). Based on these data we conclude that histone methyl-lysine recognition activity is a common feature of PHD fingers present within the S. cerevisiae proteome. The three HMTs that catalyze methylation of H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79 are Set1, Set2, and Dot1, respectively. We thus determined if proteins with PHD fingers that have methyl-histone binding activity are reported to be genetically or physically linked to one of these HMTs. Notably, all of the H3K4me binders with the exception of Bye1 and Jhd1 are identified as Set1 interactors, and Nto1, which binds to H3K36me3, is linked to Set2 (Table 1; see “Discussion”). No links to HMTs were found for the four proteins that fail to bind methyled histones (Table 1). These data suggest a link between the methyl-histone recognition property of PHD fingers and the function of their cognate protein. The molecular basis of specificity by the PHD fingers of ING2 and BPTF for H3K4me3 versus other methylated lysines is achieved by a coordinated fitting of the trimethyl moiety of H3K4 and the long side chain of H3R2 into adjacent surface pockets bracketed by an invariant tryptophan (Fig. 3b) (10Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 18Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In this context, alignment of the sequences from the S. cerevisiae PHD fingers and those of ING2 and BPTF revealed that many of the yeast PHD fingers include residues predicted critical for the interaction in the appropriate linear positions (Fig. 3A). For example, the ING2 homologues and Spp1(PHD) have the full complement of conserved residues and indeed bind to H3K4me3. Other PHD fingers, including Bye1(PHD), Cti6(PHD), Jhd1(PHD), and Set3(PHD) are only partially conserved yet still bind to H3K4me3, whereas Ecm5(PHD), despite having virtually all the known conserved residues required for H3K4me3 binding, recognizes H3K36me3 rather than H3K4me3 (Figs. 2 and 3A). Finally, Set4(PHD), which contains the invariant tryptophan residue, has no detectable histone methyl-lysine binding activity, even after attempts to engineer gain-of-function Set4(PHD) protein via introduction of the full set of residues essential for the activity of ING2(PHD) and BPTF(PHD) (supplemental Fig. 1). Based on these data, we argue that the conserved sequence information provides an important but limited element of predictive value with respect to potential histone methyl-lysine binding activity for PHD fingers. We turned to structural modeling to obtain a better insight into the molecular determinants of methyl-lysine affinity and specificity for the various PHD fingers. This analysis revealed that the analogous structural surface entities formed by the residues critical for determining H3K4me3 specificity for ING2(PHD) and BPTF(PHD), comprised of an aromatic cage and an adjacent groove bracketed by a tryptophan residue, are predicted to be present in all of the H3K4me-binding yeast PHD fingers (Fig. 3b and supplemental Fig. 2) (10Pena P.V. Davrazou F. Shi X. Walter K.L. Verkhusha V.V. Gozani O. Zhao R. Kutateladze T.G. Nature. 2006; 442: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 18Li H. Ilin S. Wang W. Duncan E.M. Wysocka J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nature. 2006; 442: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Notably, the PHD fingers from Bye1, Cti6, Jhd1, and Set3 lack a conserved tyrosine residue that forms a part of the aromatic cage for ING2 and BPTF and in lieu have a nearby similarly positioned bulky residue (Fig. 3b and supplemental Fig. 2). These data argue that S. cerevisiae PHD fingers use a molecular mechanism similar to that of mammalian ING2(PHD) and BPTF(PHD) to distinguish H3K4me3 versus other methylated lysines. We directly tested this notion by generating alanine mutants of all the H3K4me3-binding PHD fingers, targeting the equivalent residues as Asp230 (which forms critical electrostatic interactions with H3R2) and Trp238 of ING2(PHD) (Fig. 3A, arrows). As shown in Fig. 3C, each mutant abolished the ability of the cognate PHD finger to bind H3K4me3, providing experimental evidence to support the structural modeling. Next, we asked if modeling Ecm5(PHD) and Nto1(PHD-1) might provide insight into the molecular basis of H3K36me3 recognition. Notwithstanding the considerable differences in primary amino acid sequence, modeling predicts that both PHD fingers use the same surface to form the K36me3-binding pocket as that used by the known K4me3-binders (Fig. 4, A and B). In this regard, mutagenesis within the methyl-Lys binding pocket largely eliminated the interaction with H3K36me3 peptides for both PHD fingers (Fig. 4C). The specificity for methylated Lys36 versus Lys4 is likely due to the surrounding amino acid sequence. Specifically, the large side chains of Glu1254 in Ecm5(PHD) and Phe285 in Nto1(PHD-1) are in a position to interfere sterically with the long side chain of H3R2 (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the surrounding region of H3K36 is more flexible and thus steric hindrance is less of a factor. Together, these data suggest that PHD fingers may use the same mechanism for binding the trimethyl group, with additional contacts between the sequence surrounding the methylated lysine and the PHD finger surface determining the ligand specificity. Methylation events at H3K4 and H3K36 have been linked to multiple diverse activities (5Daniel J.A. Pray-Grant M.G. Grant P.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our genomic scale analysis indicates that PHD fingers might be critical molecular mediators that transduce these methylation events into different epigenetic programs (20Zhang Y. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this context, within the yeast proteome, PHD fingers with methyl-lysine binding activity are present within proteins of diverse functions, including modulators of methylation and acetylation (Table 1). These and other data raise the issue of how the same modification is recognized by effectors present within different proteins to potentially manifest distinct biological outcomes. There is considerable evidence that an isolated recognition event by an effector domain is necessary, but not sufficient, for determining epigenomic positioning of chromatin-regulatory proteins. Sufficiency is most likely determined by multiple concurrent interactions functioning in a combinatorial fashion to generate a specific localization (21Becker P.B. Nature. 2006; 442: 31-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this regard, many chromatin-regulatory proteins and complexes contain multiple effector domains. For example, the NuA3 complex has two PHD finger proteins, Yng1 and Nto1 that bind to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3, respectively, and the enzymes that generate H3K4me3 (SET1) and H3K36me3 (SET2) are both required for NuA3 association with chromatin (17Martin D.G.

Baetz K. Howe L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3018-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Numerous additional molecular interactions, such as protein-protein interaction networks seeded by locus-specific transcription factors, are expected to contribute to epigenomic localization of chromatin-regulatory activities. Thus, recognition of a specific methyl-lysine event will manifest differently depending on the surrounding chromatin context, and as such, offers substantial signaling flexibility. The observation that more than half of S. cerevisiae PHD fingers have methyl-lysine binding activity in conjunction with the considerable diversity in sequences of these PHD fingers argues that the number of methyl-lysine binders in the human proteome is certain to be far greater than predicted based solely on homology to the PHD fingers of ING2 and BPTF. Finally, the fact that a number of PHD fingers fail to bind to methylated histones raises the intriguing possibility that these PHD fingers recognize methylated lysines present on non-histone proteins (23Zhang K.

Here we used microarray RNA analysis of in vivo and in vitro models of IRI to delineate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Microarray analysis of renal tissue after ischemia-reperfusion revealed a number of highly up-regulated antioxidant genes including aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A7), glutathione S-transferases (GSTM5, GSTA2 and GSTP1), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). The transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of this antioxidant response, is also elevated in IRI. Furthermore, microarray analysis of renal epithelial cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation identified Nrf2 to be up-regulated on reoxygenation. We also reveal a reoxygenation-specific nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 protein and subsequent activation of a NQO1 promoter reporter construct. Attenuating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in reoxygenation using the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine results in inhibition of Nrf-2 activation. mRNA levels for Nrf2-dependent genes were detected in human liver biopsy 1 h after transplantation. These results indicate that reoxygenation-dependent Nrf-2 activity facilitates ischemic preconditioning through the induction of antioxidant gene expression and that ROS may be critical in signaling this event."

These isotopic anomalies are indicative of mass fractionation during chemical reactions at extremely low temperatures (10 to 20 kelvin), characteristic of cold molecular clouds and the outer protosolar disk. The globules probably originated as organic ice coatings on preexisting grains that were photochemically processed into refractory organic matter. The globules resemble cometary carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (CHON) particles, suggesting that such grains were important constituents of the solar system starting materials."

We demonstrated such control with two flux qubits coupled together through their mutual inductances and through the dc superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) that reads out their magnetic flux states. A bias current applied to the SQUID in the zero-voltage state induced a change in the dynamic inductance, reducing the coupling energy controllably to zero and reversing its sign."
https://openalex.org/W2043865723,"Members of the Notch family of receptors act as membrane-tethered transcription factors that are tightly associated with binary cell fate decisions. Notch signaling acts as a molecular gate that allows cells to adopt or forfeit a particular fate. Interaction of Notch with ligands triggers a sequence of proteolytic cleavages that release the intracellular domain to the nucleus; this mechanism is a target of therapies for leukemias associated with Notch activation. Although the molecular mechanism of Notch activation is well characterized, further analysis in an appropriate cellular context will provide new insight into Notch signaling."

This spontaneous reaction leads to the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which accumulate in bone tissue and affect its structural and mechanical properties. We have investigated the role of matrix AGEs on bone resorption mediated by mature osteoclasts and the effects of exogenous AGEs on osteoclastogenesis. Using in vitro resorption assays performed on control- and AGE-modified bone and ivory slices, we showed that the resorption process was markedly inhibited when mature osteoclasts were seeded on slices containing matrix pentosidine, a well characterized AGE. More specifically, the total area resorbed per slice, and the area degraded per resorption lacuna created by osteoclasts, were significantly decreased in AGE-containing slices. This inhibition of bone resorption was confirmed by a marked reduction of the release of type I collagen fragments generated by the collagenolytic enzymes secreted by osteoclasts in the culture medium of AGE-modified mineralized matrices. This effect is likely to result from decreased solubility of collagen molecules in the presence of AGEs, as documented by the reduction of pepsin-mediated digestion of AGE-containing collagen. We found that AGE-modified BSA totally inhibited osteoclastogenesis in vitro, most likely by impairing the commitment of osteoclast progenitors into pre-osteoclastic cells. Although the mechanisms remain unknown, AGEs might interfere with osteoclastic differentiation and activity through their interaction with specific cell-surface receptors, because we showed that both osteoclast progenitors and mature osteoclasts expressed different AGEs receptors, including receptor for AGEs (RAGEs). These results suggest that AGEs decreased osteoclast-induced bone resorption, by altering not only the structural integrity of bone matrix proteins but also the osteoclastic differentiation process.

Non-enzymatic glycation is a common post-translational modification of proteins induced by the spontaneous condensation of reducing sugars (e.g. glucose) and metabolic intermediates (e.g. triose phosphates, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal) with free amino groups in lysine or arginine residues. The early step of the so-called Maillard reaction is the formation of a Schiff base adduct to protein. This early glycation product undergoes a reversible rearrangement to form an Amadori product adduct to protein (i.e. an intermediate glycation product). Schiff bases and Amadori products then undergo a complex series of rearrangements, oxidations, and/or dehydrations along different chemical pathways to produce a class of irreversible adducts to proteins, the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) 3The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; RAGE, receptor for AGEs; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; FCS, fetal calf serum; αMEM, α-minimal essential medium; RT, reverse transcription; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; RANK-L, receptor of activator of nuclear factor κB-ligand; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PYD, pyridinoline; DPD, deoxypyridinoline; AMG, aminoguanidine; βCTX, β-isomerized and crosslinked C-telopeptide fragment of type I collagen.

Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A direct consequence of these highly diverse reaction pathways leading to AGE formation is that a wide variety of AGEs with different chemical structures is formed. Some AGEs are adducts to the protein (e.g. carboxymethyllysine and carboxyethyllysine), whereas others present protein-protein cross-links (e.g. pentosidine, glyoxal-derived lysine dimer, and methylglyoxal-derived lysine dimer). Since the initial characterization of the pentosidine cross-link by Sell and Monnier (3Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. Connect Tissue Res. 1989; 19: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 4Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), many AGEs (and more recently advanced lipoxidation end products) have been identified. However, it is unclear which, if any, of these AGEs can be designated as the most functionally relevant, and new AGEs are continuously being discovered. Once formed, AGEs are removed from the tissue only when the protein involved is degraded. Consequently, the most extensive accumulation of AGEs will occur in tissues characterized by low turnover and containing consequently long-lived proteins, such as collagen in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues (e.g. cartilage, bone, tendon, and skin) (5Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Thorpe S.R. Bank R.A. Shaw J.N. Lyons T.J. Bijlsma J.W. Lafeber F.P. Baynes J.W. TeKoppele J.M. J. Biol.

Formation and accumulation of AGEs are characteristic features of tissues of aged people, but they also occur in patients with diabetes mellitus, mainly those with poorly controlled hyperglycemia. AGEs have also been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of AGE-related and diabetic complications, such as retinopathy, glomerulopathy, neuropathy, and diabetic atherosclerosis (6Singh R.

Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 16R-28RCrossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that AGEs are involved in skeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis, which is a chronic disabling disorder of aged people. Accumulation of AGEs in articular cartilage affects cellular characteristics and increases stiffness and brittleness of the tissue, thereby rendering it more prone to mechanical damage (8Verzijl N. DeGroot J. Ben Z.C. Brau-Benjamin O. Maroudas A. Bank R.A. Mizrahi J. Schalkwijk C.G. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. Bijlsma J.W. Lafeber F.P. TeKoppele J.M.

Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 3212-3217Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). AGEs modify the structure and the subsequent functions of proteins by creating intra- or intermolecular cross-links (10Sajithlal G.B. Chithra P. Chandrakasan G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1407: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar); these could partially explain the deleterious effects of AGEs on the biomechanical properties of connective tissues. AGEs also interfere with the susceptibility of matrix proteins toward proteolytic degradation. Degradation of AGE-modified cartilage collagen by matrix metalloproteinases is impaired compared with unmodified collagen (11DeGroot J. Verzijl N. Wenting-Van Wijk M.J. Bank R.A. Lafeber F.P. Bijlsma J.W. TeKoppele J.M.

Ishioka N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 253: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Accumulation of AGEs in bone collagen matrix has been shown to alter the mechanical properties of bone, decreasing its toughness, and could therefore contribute to skeletal fragility (15Vashishth D.

Kugai N. Nagata N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Takeshita N. Mutoh S. Yamaguchi I. Life Sci. 1995; 56: 1095-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Osteopenia and osteoporosis are often observed in patients with type I diabetes, and recent cohort studies indicate that diabetes itself is associated with increased risk of fractures (20Schwartz A.V. Calcif. Tissue Int. 2003; 73: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, the role of AGEs in decreased bone strength in diabetes and subsequent contribution to fracture risk remain unclear. Eventually, AGEs modify cellular behavior by interacting with specific cellular receptors, such as RAGE (receptor for AGEs). In a craniotomy model in type I diabetic mice, the degree of bone healing was reported to be 40% of that of nondiabetic animals, and RAGE is expressed at higher levels in the healing bone tissue of diabetic animals compared with control animals. In non-diabetic animals, AGE-modified BSA application to the cranial defect reduced bone healing by 40–60% (21Santana R.B. Xu L. Chase H.B. Amar S. Graves D.T. Trackman P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1502-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It has been shown in vitro that AGEs accumulation in type I collagen interfere with the proliferation and the differentiation of osteoblastic cells, at different stages of their development (22Katayama Y. Celic S. Nagata N. Martin T.J. Findlay D.M. Bone. 1997; 21: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23McCarthy A.D. Etcheverry S.B. Cortizo A.M.

Cortizo A.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). RAGE has been shown to be expressed in osteoblasts (21Santana R.B. Xu L. Chase H.B. Amar S. Graves D.T. Trackman P.C. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1502-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 27Cortizo A.M. Lettieri M.G. Barrio D.A. Mercer N. Etcheverry S.B. McCarthy A.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 250: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and may modulate AGE-dependent signaling in osteoblasts (27Cortizo A.M. Lettieri M.G. Barrio D.A. Mercer N. Etcheverry S.B. McCarthy A.D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 250: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This observation could explain in part the decreased expression of transcription factors responsible for osteoblastic differentiation in type I diabetic mice model (28Lu H. Kraut D. Gerstenfeld L.C. Graves D.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that AGEs may play a role in the pathogenesis of diabetic osteopenia as well as that of age-related decreased bone strength and increased risk of fracture; however, the details of such deleterious mechanisms remain to be clarified. Bone mass is tightly regulated by the differentiation and activity of bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) through a process called bone remodeling. The contribution of non-enzymatic glycations to bone remodeling has been poorly investigated in vivo, mainly due to a lack of suitable animal models; for instance, insulin deficiency or resistance in diabetic animal models might interfere with cell differentiation or function processes. Although the role of AGEs in osteoblasts differentiation and function has been well characterized in vitro (23McCarthy A.D. Etcheverry S.B. Cortizo A.M. Acta Diabetol. 1999; 36: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26McCarthy A.D. Uemura T. Etcheverry S.B. Cortizo A.M. Int. J. Biochem.

Acta Diabetol. 2001; 38: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), their contribution to osteoclast activity and differentiation is unknown. In the present study we first investigated the effects of matrix AGEs on bone resorption by osteoclasts, using an in vitro resorption assay on AGE-modified mineralized matrices. We then extended our analysis to the contribution of exogenous AGEs to osteoclastogenesis. In Vitro AGE-Matrix and AGE-BSA Formation—Elephant ivory slices (6-mm diameter, kindly donated by the Centre de conservation et d’é;tude des collections, Lyon, France) and bone cortical slices (3-mm diameter) from 3-month-old calves were used in these experiments. Human cortical bone slices (3-mm diameter) were prepared from a 40-year-old male femur obtained from necropsy (Faculté;de Mé;decine Laennec, Lyon, France). Slices (0.3-mm thick) were cut with an Isomet low speed saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL), cleaned by sonication, sterilized for 2 min in 70% ethanol, and stored dry at -20 °C until AGE-matrix formation or in vitro resorption assay. In vitro AGEs formation in mineralized tissues was performed according to adapted protocols of those previously described for tendon or cartilage collagens (30Reddy G.K. Exp. Diabesity Res. 2004; 5: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Pokharna H.K. Pottenger L.A. J. Surg. Res. 2000; 94: 35-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Ivory and bone slices were incubated with 0.2 m d-ribose in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 45 and 60 days at 37 °C, respectively. Alternatively, the slices were incubated with 0.05–0.6 m d-ribose in 10 ml of Tris-buffered saline solution (TBS, pH 7.4), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, for 2–7 days at 37 °C, to modulate the level of AGEs formed. Control incubations were also performed with PBS or TBS. Incubation solutions were replaced every day, and the pH was controlled routinely to ensure optimal buffering activity during the glycation process. AGE-BSA was prepared according to a modified version of methods previously described (32Valencia J.V. Weldon S.C. Quinn D. Kiers G.H. DeGroot J. TeKoppele J.M. Hughes T.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 324: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 33Bhatwadekar A.D. Ghole V.S. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 2005; 19: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 mg/ml BSA (Fraction V, sterile filtered, Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated at 37 °C, under sterile conditions, with 0.6 m d-ribose for 1 week or with 0.5 m d-glucose and 0.3 m lysine for 4 weeks in PBS (pH 7.4) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The unincorporated sugars were removed by dialysis against PBS. These products were designated as AGE-1 and AGE-2, respectively. Non-AGE-modified BSA was incubated in the same conditions except for the absence of reducing sugars. Glycated BSA (1–5 mol of fructosamine per mol of albumin, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a negative control. BSA derivatives were quantified using the Bio-Rad protein assay system, and the concentrations of pentosidine were determined as described hereafter (Table 3).TABLE 3Pentosidine concentrations in the different BSA derivatives BSA was incubated as described in the experimental procedures section to produce AGE-1 and AGE-2. Glycated BSA is a commercially available modified BSA that contains fructosamine, an intermediate glycation product. Pentosidine concentrations were determined in each BSA derivative, and the results are expressed as mean ± S.D.

Bones were removed, cleaned of soft tissues and bone marrow, split, and scraped into M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen) and 20 mm HEPES (Invitrogen). Cells were centrifuged at low speed, resuspended in αMEM containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2% FCS (all products from Invitrogen), and seeded on ivory or bone slices in 48- or 96-well culture plates, respectively, for 3 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After this setting period, non-adherent cells were removed, slices were washed in PBS, and the remaining cells were incubated for 3–8 days in complete αMEM containing 2% FCS and at pH ∼7.0 (34Hoebertz A. Arnett T.R. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 80: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of culture, cells were removed in 1 m NaOH for 20 min, and the slices were rinsed three times in water and stained with acid hematoxylin for 30 s and then with 1% (w/v) toluidine blue in 1% (w/v) sodium borate for 30 s. The number and the area of resorption lacunae were then measured by light microscopy using LUCIA® Software (Nikon, France), as previously described (35Raynal C. Delmas P.D. Chenu C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2347-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the number of lacunae and total area resorbed per slice, as well as the area resorbed per lacuna per slice. Biochemical Assessment of Bone Collagen Degradation in Culture Media—The release of type I collagen fragments, subsequent to resorption of bone and dentin slices, was also quantified in the culture supernatants using two immunological methods: (i) the concentrations of cross-linked and isomerized C-terminal fragments of type I collagen (βCTX) were determined using the CrossLaps for Culture ELISA kit (Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics, Herlev, Denmark) as recommended by the manufacturer; and (ii) the concentrations of the helical peptide corresponding to the 620–633 fragment of human type I collagen were measured using the METRA® Helical Peptide EIA kit (Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA). Collagen fragments released into the culture media were also analyzed by measuring the hydroxyproline concentration using the Hydroxyproline by high-performance liquid chromatography reagent from Bio-Rad, after acid hydrolysis of the conditioned culture media. Murine Osteoclast Differentiation—Bone marrow cells of 6- to 8-week-old male NMRI mice were seeded at 5000 cells/mm2 and cultured for 8 days in differentiation medium: αMEM containing 10% FCS (HyClone Laboratories, Perbio Science, Cheshire, UK), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 30 ng/ml recombinant mouse macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and 30 ng/ml soluble recombinant RANK-L mixed with 2.5 μg/ml mouse anti-polyhistidine antibody, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (R&D Systems Europe, France). After the differentiation process on plastic dishes, mature osteoclasts were removed after four washes with PBS by using 0.25 mm EDTA in PBS during 30 min, and after centrifugation osteoclasts were seeded on dentin slices and incubated in differentiation medium for 8 days, as described (36Saltel F. Destaing O. Bard F. Eichert D. Jurdic P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5231-5241Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). RAW264.7 Cell Culture and Differentiation—The murine monocytic cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and maintained on 9-cm diameter uncoated plastic dishes in α-MEM containing 10% FCS (Invitrogen) with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Osteoclastogenesis experiments were performed as described previously (37Merle B. Itzstein C. Delmas P.D. Chenu C. J. Cell.

For RT-PCR analysis, the cells were seeded at 500 cells/mm2 and incubated or not with 50 μg/ml of BSA or AGE-1 for 48 h. Human CD-14-positive Monocytes Isolation and Osteoclast Differentiation—Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors (Etablissement Français du Sang, Lyon). Blood, diluted 1:1 with 4 °C PBS, was carefully layered on Ficoll-Paque™ Plus (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and centrifuged at 700 × g for 20 min. The lymphocytes interface was collected, washed twice with 4 °C PBS followed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 12 min, and resuspended in cold PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum. CD-14-positive cells were isolated using magnetic beads coated with a mouse monoclonal anti-CD14 antibody according to the recommendation of the manufacturer (Dynabeads CD14 monocytes/macrophages, Dynal Biotech, Invitrogen). CD-14-positive cells were resuspended in αMEM containing 10% of fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories), 25 ng/ml recombinant human macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and 25 ng/ml soluble recombinant RANK-L, mixed with 2.5 μg/ml mouse anti-polyhistidine antibody. Culture media were replaced every second day with growth and differentiation factors up to 15 days. For the bone resorption assay, differentiating cells (at day 10) were detached and seeded on control- and ribose-incubated bovine bone slices and cultured for 8 days in the presence of growth and differentiation factors. Tartrate-resistant Acid Phosphatase Activity Assay and Cytochemistry—TRAP activity in the culture media was measured using a colorimetric assay (38Henriksen K. Gram J. Schaller S. Dahl B.H.

The reaction buffer (412 mm acetic acid, 0.209% Triton X-100, 412 mm NaCl, 4.12 mm EDTA, 10.6 mm ascorbic acid, 10.1 mm 4-nitrophenylphosphate, 41.6 mm Na2 tartrate at pH 5.5) was added to conditioned media, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark, and then stopped with 100 μl of 300 mm NaOH. Colorimetric changes were measured at 405 nm with 650 nm as the reference using an ELISA reader. Cellular TRAP activity was measured using the Leukocyte Acid Phosphatase kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 5 min with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS, and stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Biochemical Analyses of Bone Collagen—The amount of pyridinoline (PYD), deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and pentosidine was measured after hydrolysis of the bone or ivory slices. Briefly, slices (∼7 mg wet weight) were hydrolyzed by HCl at 110 °C during 20 h. Collagen cross-links were extracted from hydrolysates using solid phase extraction cross-links Chromabond column (Macherey-Nagel, France). Separation of the different cross-links was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography on an Alliance 2695 separation module using an Atlantis dC18 column (3 μm, 4.6 × 100 mm) protected by an Atlantis dC18 guard cartridge (3 μm, 4.6 × 20 mm, Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Molecules were separated by using a gradient solution. Solvent A consisted of 0.06% of heptafluorobutyric acid, and solvent B was 50% of solvent A and 50% of acetonitrile. The flow rate was 1.2 ml/min, and the column temperature was 40 °C. The separation of PYD and DPD was performed during the first 12 min of an isocratic step at 14% of solvent B, and pentosidine was eluted during the following 24 min of gradient from 14 to 31% solvent B. PYD and DPD were monitored for fluorescence at an emission of 395 nm and an excitation of 297 nm, and then wavelengths were shifted to 385 nm and 335 nm, respectively, for determination of pentosidine (multi-λ fluorescence detector, Waters 2475). Pyridinium cross-links were quantified against a calibrator supplied by Metra Biosystems Ltd. Pentosidine standard was synthesized and calibrated with a standard of pentosidine generously given by Dr. M. Takahashi (University of Saitama, Japan). Hydroxyproline content was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography using the hydroxyproline by high-performance liquid chromatography reagent from Bio-Rad. Collagen Solubility—After demineralization in 0.5 m EDTA, 0.05 m Tris, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 72 h, bone slices were rinsed and submitted to limited pepsin digestion in 0.5 mg/ml pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5 m acetic acid for 4 h at 37 °C with constant shaking. The reaction (1 ml) was stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 1 mm pepstatin and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. Collagen concentration was determined in the supernatant and pellet by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline (as described above) after acid hydrolysis in 6 n HCl for 20 h at 110 °C. Collagen solubility was expressed as the collagen concentration in the supernatant after pepsin digestion as a percentage of total recoverable collagen in pellet and supernatant. RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from RAW264.7 cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and digested with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. Reverse transcriptions were performed as described previously (40Valcourt U. Kowanetz M. Niimi H. Heldin C.H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2148864400,"Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 are tetratricopeptide repeat proteins found in steroid receptor complexes, and Fkbp51 is an androgen receptor (AR) target gene. Although in vitro studies suggest that Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 regulate hormone binding and/or subcellular trafficking of receptors, the roles of Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 in vivo have not been extensively investigated. Here, we evaluate their physiological roles in Fkbp52-deficient and Fkbp51-deficient mice. Fkbp52-deficient males developed defects in select reproductive organs (e.g. penile hypospadias and prostate dysgenesis but normal testis), pointing to a role for Fkbp52 in AR-mediated signaling and function. Surprisingly, ablation of Fkbp52 did not affect AR hormone binding or nuclear translocation in vivo and in vitro. Molecular studies in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells uncovered that Fkbp52 is critical to AR transcriptional activity. Interestingly, Fkbp51 expression was down-regulated in Fkbp52-deficient males but only in affected tissues, providing further evidence of tissue-specific loss of AR activity and suggesting that Fkbp51 is an AR target gene essential to penile and prostate development. However, Fkbp51-deficient mice were normal, showing no defects in AR-mediated reproductive function. Our work demonstrates that Fkbp52 but not Fkbp51 is essential to AR-mediated signaling and provides evidence for an unprecedented Fkbp52 function, direct control of steroid receptor transcriptional activity.

Androgen receptor (AR) 3The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; AIS, androgen insensitivity syndrome; ARKO, androgen receptor knock-out; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; SR, steroid receptor; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PR, progesterone receptor; RT, reverse transcription; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; MMTV, murine mammary tumor virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; DHT, dihydrotestosterone. is a hormone-induced transcription factor that controls male sexual development and other important physiologies. Similar to other members of the nuclear receptor family (1.Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2699) Google Scholar, 2.Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), AR has three major functional domains: an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (3.Danielian P.S.

Mutations found in each of these domains lead to a series of AR functional defects associated with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) or partial AIS in humans (6.Batch J.A. Williams D.M.

The majority of AIS and partial AIS patients have developmental defects in the male reproductive system. Loss-of-function AR mutations in mice recapitulate many of the reproductive defects found in AIS patients. For example, the AR-deficient (androgen receptor knock-out; ARKO) mouse (8.Yeh S. Tsai M.Y. Xu Q. Mu X.M. Lardy H. Huang K.E. Lin H. Yeh S.D. Altuwaijri S. Zhou X. Xing L. Boyce B.F. Hung M.C. Zhang S. Gan L. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) both develop severe defects of testicular development and an overall lack of male sexual differentiation, including hypospadias and penile agenesis. The tfm male mouse demonstrates many female secondary structures, including vagina and teats (10.Lyon M.F. Hawkes S.G. Nature. 1970; 227: 1217-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Molecular regulation of AR function can be achieved at several levels, such as spatial-temporal expression of the receptor, modulation of ligand binding, cytoplasm to nucleus translocation, and DNA binding and transcriptional activities (11.Tilley W.D.

Chatterjee B. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Prior to hormone binding, steroid receptors form large protein complexes containing the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as well as various co-chaperone tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins (13.Nair S.C.

These co-chaperones include Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 (FK506-binding protein 52 and 51, respectively), Cyp40 (cyclophilin 40), and PP5 (protein phosphatase 5). Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 are ubiquitously expressed proteins with peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity that is inhibited by the binding of FK506 immunosuppressant ligand (16.Yem A.W. Tomasselli A.G.

Each TPR protein enters into steroid receptor complexes through a direct and competitive binding at the C terminus of Hsp90 via its essential TPR domain (19.Owens-Grillo J.K. Hoffmann K.

Although Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 share a similar domain structure, as well as 60% sequence identity and 75% similarity, they do differ in that Fkbp51 is missing a C-terminal calmodulin-binding domain. To date, most studies on TPR control of the steroid receptor (SR) action have been done using conventional molecular and cellular approaches and using the glucocorticoid (GR) and progesterone (PR) receptors as models. It has been shown that Fkbp52 is localized to both cytoplasm and nucleus but that the cytoplasmic fraction co-localizes with microtubules in a complex containing dynein (22.Ruff V.A. Yem A.W. Munns P.L. Adams L.D. Reardon I.M. Deibel Jr., M.R. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21285-21288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Czar M.J. Owens-Grillo J.K. Yem A.W. Leach K.L. Deibel Jr., M.R. Welsh M.J. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1731-1741PubMed Google Scholar). For these reasons, it was proposed that Fkbp52 serves as an adaptor between the GR·Hsp90 complex and the microtubule transport machinery (24.Pratt W.B. Czar M.J. Stancato L.F. Owens J.K. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, various groups have shown that Fkbp52 contributes to both the dynein interaction and hormone-induced translocation of GR (25.Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. Murphy P.J. Chinkers M. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Zhang M. Pratt W.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13602-13610Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26.Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4609-4616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, a second line of inquiry has provided evidence for reciprocal control of GR and PR hormone binding function by Fkbp52 and Fkbp51, with Fkbp52 causing potentiation and Fkbp51 causing attenuation of this activity (15.Davies T.H. Sanchez E.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28.Reynolds P.D. Ruan Y. Smith D.F. Scammell J.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

These observations suggest a model in which differential incorporation of TPR proteins into SR complexes forms the basis for selective control of hormone binding and subcellular trafficking. Although evidence for interaction of Fkbp52 with AR is fairly common (21.Cheung-Flynn J. Roberts P.J. Riggs D.L. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17388-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30.Tai P.K. Maeda Y. Nakao K. Wakim N.G. Duhring J.L. Faber L.E.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7422-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), reports of Fkbp51 in AR complexes are limited (32.Febbo P.G. Lowenberg M. Thorner A.R. Brown M. Loda M. Golub T.R. J. Urol. 2005; 173: 1772-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, it has recently become clear that Fkbp51 is a highly sensitive AR-regulated gene, at least in the prostate cancer cell line LnCAP, where androgen-induced expression of Fkbp51 can be blocked by the Hsp90 inhibitor galdanamycin (32.Febbo P.G. Lowenberg M. Thorner A.R. Brown M. Loda M. Golub T.R. J. Urol. 2005; 173: 1772-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 33.Zhu W. Zhang J.S. Young C.Y.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 2002; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations would suggest that Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 play essential and perhaps distinct roles in AR function, yet little is known on this matter. Interestingly, a recent report by Febbo et al. (32.Febbo P.G. Lowenberg M. Thorner A.R. Brown M. Loda M. Golub T.R. J. Urol. 2005; 173: 1772-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) suggests that overexpression of Fkbp51 has a stimulatory effect on AR-mediated transcriptional activity rather than inhibition, as known for GR and PR. Thus, it is possible that Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 exert distinct and diverse effects on various members of the steroid receptor family. With the above considerations in mind, we set out to generate mice genetically deficient in Fkbp52 and Fkbp51. Although it was fully expected that alterations to GR-regulated physiology would be a prominent feature of Fkbp52 loss, we were surprised to find no such effect. Instead, the primary phenotype of Fkbp52 ablation was infertility in both male and female mice. Female Fkbp52-deficient mice were sterile due to a selective loss of activity by the PR-A isoform in the uterus, leading to a complete failure of implantation (35.Yang Z. Wolf I.M. Chen H. Periyasamy S. Chen Z. Yong W. Shi S. Zhao W. Xu J. Srivastava A. Sanchez E.R. Shou W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2682-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Here, we report that Fkbp52 is critical to male fertility by controlling AR-mediated signaling and physiology. Loss of Fkbp52 resulted in aberrant penile development causing hypospadias, as well as prostate dysgenesis, while leaving other AR-regulated organs unaffected. Molecular studies showed that Fkbp52 loss had a dramatic effect on AR-mediated gene expression that, surprisingly, was not due to altered AR hormone-binding and/or nuclear translocation functions. Analysis of Fkbp51 as an AR target gene showed it to be down-regulated only in Fkbp52-deficient tissues exhibiting altered AR activity. By generating and analyzing Fkbp51-deficient mice, we were able to assess its direct contribution to AR activity in vivo and its role as a target gene in AR-mediated development of the penis and prostate. Interestingly, no alterations to male (or female) physiology were noted in the Fkbp51-deficient mice, showing that Fkbp51 is not essential to AR signaling in vivo. Generation of Fkbp52-deficient Mice and Fkbp51-deficient Mice−The generation of Fkbp52-deficient mice was described in a previous report (35.Yang Z. Wolf I.M. Chen H. Periyasamy S. Chen Z. Yong W. Shi S. Zhao W. Xu J. Srivastava A. Sanchez E.R. Shou W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2682-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To generate Fkbp51-deficient mice, a promoter-trapped ES cell line RRC236 containing an insertional mutation in the mouse Fkbp51 gene was identified and obtained from BayGenomics (36.Stanford W.L. Cohn J.B. Cordes S.P. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 756-768Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The gene trap vector (pGT1Lxf) contains a splice acceptor sequence upstream of the reporter gene β-geo. Using genomic PCR, Southern blot, and sequencing analyses, we confirmed a single genomic insertion at intron 4 of the mouse Fkbp51 gene. The chimeric male mice were generated from RRC236 ES cell line and were further bred to C57BL/6J females to generate F1 offspring. Genotypes were determined by Southern blot analysis. Northern blot, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses confirmed that there was no Fkbp51 leaky expression in Fkbp51-deficient mice. The SC11518 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect Fkbp51 by Western blotting. Fkbp52/Fkbp51 compound mutants were generated by interbreeding heterozygous Fkbp52 and Fkbp51 mutant mice. We also used PCR analysis of the sry gene to determine genders of embryos. All animal experiments were carried out using a protocol approved by the Indiana University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Research Advisory Committee. Morphology, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry−We examined the morphology and histology of multiple tissues and organs from male mice and age-matched littermate control mice. Embryos were harvested from timed mating females by cesarean section. Isolated embryos and tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned (6 μm) and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Three-dimensional reconstruction was carried out as previously described (37.Yucel S. Cavalcanti A.G. Desouza A. Wang Z. Baskin L.S. BJU Int. 2003; 92: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Immunohistological analysis was carried out as previously described (38.Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z.

Antibody against AR (SC7305) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting−Samples were resolved on denaturing SDS gels (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Transfer of samples to Immobilon-P® membranes and immunoblotting were performed as previously described (26.Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The SC7305 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody against AR was used to probe for receptor, whereas various antibodies were used to probe for Fkbp52 (SC1803; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fkbp51 (SC11518; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cyp40 (PA3-022; Affinity BioReagents), and PP5 (gift from Dr. Michael Chinkers) (40.Chen M.S.

The blots were then incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated counter antibodies, followed by detection of bands by enhanced chemiluminescence. Serum Hormone Measurement−Afternoon blood samples were drawn (between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m.) from the right ventricle of adult mice (2-3 months of age). Serum levels of testosterone and DHT (dihydrotestosterone) were analyzed by using radioimmune assay kits (DSL-4000 for testosterone, DSL-9600 for DHT; Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc., Webster, TX). Steroid measurements were performed at the Endocrinology Core Laboratory of the Indiana University School of Medicine. Reporter Gene Assays in Mouse Embryonic Fibroblast Cells−Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from wild-type and Fkbp52-deficient embryonic day 13.5 embryos. MEF cells were cultured in DMEM with 15% FBS until confluence. To generate immortalized MEF cells, primary cells were transfected with SV40. Pooled transformed cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Both wild-type and Fkbp52-deficient MEF cells maintain normal fibroblast morphology with high proliferative activity. MEF cells were either transiently or permanently transfected with expression vectors for human AR (kind gift of Lirim Shemshedini). The MMTV-CAT reporter and PSA (prostate-specific antigen)-luciferase reporter (kind gift of Marianne Sadar) constructs were used to assay for AR activity (41.Wise S.C. Burmeister L.A. Zhou X.F.

Fowlkes D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), using [3H]acetyl-CoA as substrate, whereas luciferase activity was measured using a commercial kit (Promega). All values were normalized for transfection efficiency by co-transfection with a cytomegalovirus-driven galactosidase reporter. AR Hormone Binding Assay−Wild-type and Fkbp52-deficient MEF cells were transiently transfected with human AR expression plasmid (pSG5). Forty-eight hours following transfection, cell pellets were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium molybdate, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors, followed by Dounce homogenization and centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Supernatants (cytosol fraction) were used for the binding assay without freezing. In a typical binding assay, 150 μl of cytosol (∼2.0 mg/ml) were incubated with 10.0 nm [3H]mibolerone, (70.0 Ci/mmol) for 20 h on ice. Mibolerone is a synthetic high affinity AR ligand. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled mibolerone (10 μm). Protein-bound radioactivity was isolated using 1% dextran-coated charcoal in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). Specific binding was normalized for AR expression as determined by Western blot and expressed as disintegrations/min/milligram of cytosol protein. Quantitative RT-PCR−Total RNAs were isolated from mouse tissues or cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNAs were synthesized by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 1 μg of RNA as template according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real time PCR was performed using iCycler iQ (Bio-Rad) with iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The relative expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The sequences of specific primers are listed as follows: human AR, 5′-TGGAAGCCATTGAGCCAGGTGTAG-3′ and 5′-CGTCCACGTGTAAGTTGCGGAAG-3′; Fkbp52, 5′-GCCTCTCGAAGGAGTGGACATCAG-3′ and 5′-CGGTCCAGACTGGAGTCAAACTTTG-3′; Fkbp51, 5′-TGCAGATCTCCATGTGCCAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCCTTCTACAGCCTTCTTGCTCC-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-TCCTGGTATGACAATGAATACGGC-3′ and 5′-TCTTGCTCAGTGTCCTTGCTGG-3′. Reduced Fertility in Fkbp52-deficient Males−Fkbp52-deficient mice were generated as previously described (35.Yang Z. Wolf I.M. Chen H. Periyasamy S. Chen Z. Yong W. Shi S. Zhao W. Xu J. Srivastava A. Sanchez E.R. Shou W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2682-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Fkbp52-deficient mice were viable. However, mutant males showed a rate of growth equivalent to that of wild type females (Fig. 1A). By breeding to wild type female mice, we found that Fkbp52-deficient males had greatly reduced fertility. Only 5% of Fkbp52-deficient males were able to plug females. Analysis of plugged females showed significantly smaller litters from Fkbp52-deficient males (mean = 2.1 ± 0.9; n = 7) compared with wild type males (mean = 6.8 ± 1.6, n = 16, p < 0.001). Fkbp52-deficient females were sterile due to implantation failure. Detailed analysis of Fkbp52-deficient females and the role of Fkbp52 in regulating progesterone receptor function at the uterus was reported elsewhere (35.Yang Z. Wolf I.M. Chen H. Periyasamy S. Chen Z. Yong W. Shi S. Zhao W. Xu J. Srivastava A. Sanchez E.R. Shou W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2682-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Selective Reproductive Defects in Adult Fkbp52-deficient Males−The most striking morphological defect observed in adult Fkbp52-deficient males was the presence of hypospadias with 100% penetrance in the external penile genitalia (Fig. 1B). Similar to hypospadias in humans, the foreskin was underdeveloped, and the penile glans and anterior portion of tubercle were exposed in the majority of Fkbp52-deficient mutant males, compared with the normal male genital tubercle that was surrounded and covered by foreskin (compare a and b). All Fkbp52-deficient males showed an ectopic opening on the ventral side of the penis (c and d), which was confirmed by histological staining (e and f). Three-dimensional reconstruction of serial histological sections of embryonic genital tubercles confirmed the hypospadias phenotype to be a developmental defect resulting from failure to form urethral seams (Fig. 1C). These defects mimic the typical clinical features of hypospadias patients. In addition, the length and weight of Fkbp52-deficient penises were significantly less when compared with littermate controls (Table 1). The anogenital distance was shortened in Fkbp52-deficient males (3-10 weeks of age) (Fig. 1D), a feminization phenotype similar to that seen in ARKO and testicular feminization (tfm) mice, albeit to a lesser degree (8.Yeh S.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, primary sex organs appeared to be unaffected by Fkbp52 loss. Fkbp52-deficient males developed normal size of testes and epididymis (Table 1) and had normal scrotal sacs and inguinal canals (data not shown). Histological analysis confirmed seminiferous tubules, spermatogenesis, Sertoli cells, and Leydig cells all to be normal in the Fkbp52 mutant testis (data not shown). Sperm motility rates were slightly lower in mutant males compared with wild type and heterozygous littermates (Table 1). In contrast, the majority of reproductive tissues affected in Fkbp52-deficient males were the secondary sex organs. Seminal vesicles (SV) were present but significantly smaller in Fkbp52-deficient mice (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). Prostate glands were initially formed through the embryonic developmental process but lacked further growth at puberty and eventually became dysgenic in Fkbp52-deficient adult males (Fig. 2B). This phenomenon is another example of compromised AR-mediated function due to Fkbp52 deficiency, since AR activity is required for the formation of mature prostate glands (44.Quigley C.A. De Bellis A. Marschke K.B. el-Awady M.K. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 271-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since secondary sex characteristics are determined by steroidal sex hormones, we measured serum testosterone and DHT levels in Fkbp52-deficient males. Levels of each hormone were slightly but significantly elevated in Fkbp52-deficient adult males (Table 1), demonstrating that lack of androgen production is not the cause of the abnormal phenotypes seen in Fkbp52-deficient males. Normal Androgen Receptor Expression, Hormone Binding, and Nuclear Translocation in Fkbp52-deficient Mice−Because Fkbp52-deficient males showed growth curves similar to females and had selective defects in reproductive organs, we reasoned that altered AR signaling might be the underlying cause of the defects. To test whether Fkbp52 ablation led to reduced levels of AR, we performed Northern blot and Western blot analyses. In both penis and testis, Fkbp52 loss had no effect on AR mRNA and protein levels (data not shown). Thus, Fkbp52 is not essential to AR expression or AR stability. To assess possible impairment of AR nuclear translocation, immunohistochemical staining using antibody against AR was performed on genital tubercles isolated from embryos at embryonic day 18.5 (Fig. 3A). In agreement with our Western blot data, overall staining of AR was equal in both wild type and homozygous embryonic tubercles. In wild type tubercle cells, AR was primarily located in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, b), presumably due to activation by circulating testosterone. Because reports for GR have shown a role for Fkbp52 in nuclear translocation (26.Davies T.H. Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4597-4600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 45.Galigniana M.D. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Housley P.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Precision spectroscopy of ultracold neutral atoms confined in a trapping potential now shows superior optical coherence without any deleterious effects from motional degrees of freedom, revealing optical resonance linewidths at the hertz level with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The resonance quality factor of 2.4 × 10 14 is the highest ever recovered in any form of coherent spectroscopy.

One family of chromatin modifiers that is ubiquitously expressed is the metastasis tumor antigens (MTA), which are integral parts of nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation (NuRD) complexes. MTA family members exist in distinct NuRD complexes, and functional redundancy is lacking among MTA family members. MTA proteins regulate divergent cellular pathways, including hormonal action, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions, differentiation, protein stability and development, and cell fate programs by modifying the acetylation status of crucial target genes.

We discuss the roles of the MTA family of chromatin modifiers, with an emphasis on their physiologic functions. Dynamic alterations in chromatin structure facilitate or repress access of transcription complexes to target DNAs, leading to transcriptional changes and the regulation of functions associated with the gene products (1Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2006; 125: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These complexes modify DNA accessibility for cofactors by affecting DNA-histone interactions, nucleosome sliding, or relocation. In addition, the transcriptional state is influenced by covalent modification of the core histones (2Mersfelder E.L. Parthun M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Among histone modifications, acetylation plays a pivotal role in chromatin remodeling (3Cohen T. Yao T.P. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: e42Google Scholar). Core histones are subject to reversible acetylation at select lysine residues in their N-terminal domains through the coordinate activity of histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) 2The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; MTA, metastasis tumor antigen; NuRD, nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylation; SUMO, small ubiquitin-like modifier; ER, estrogen receptor; NR, nuclear receptor; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transitions; LIM, Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3. (3Cohen T. Yao T.P. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: e42Google Scholar). Histone acetylation correlates with transcriptional activity, whereas deacetylation favors transcriptional repression. The mechanism of action of histone acetyltransferases is extensively reviewed elsewhere in the literature (4Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Here we discuss the current understanding of the MTA family of coregulators, which are essential components of HDAC-containing NuRD transcriptional complexes. Deacetylation of histones via HDACs is carried out by two major complexes, Sin3 and NuRD (5Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The Sin3 complex contains seven polypeptides: HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, RbAp48, Sin3, SAP18, and SAP30. This complex participates in nuclear hormone receptor repression of target genes (5Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 7Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). NuRD complexes share four core proteins (HDAC1, HDAC2, RbAp46, and RbAp48) with the Sin3 complex and contain Mi-2α/β, MTA1/2, and p66 (5Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the NuRD complex, HDAC1/2 participate in the deacetylation process; Mi-2α/β proteins with a chromodomain exhibit a DNA helicase/ATPase activity; and RbAp46/48 participate in histone binding. The roles of p66α/β in NuRD complex are complex as p66 proteins are sumoylated, and SUMO-modified p66α efficiently interacts with HDAC1, whereas RbAp46 binds to SUMO-modified p66β (8Brackertz M. Boeke J. Zhang R. Renkawitz R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40958-40966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 9Gong Z. Brackertz M. Renkawitz R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4519-4528Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All three MTA family proteins are found in NuRD complexes; however, recent data suggest that they occur in distinct complexes (10Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and thus in principle may target different sets of promoters (10Bowen N.J. Fujita N. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42560-42568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The precise role of the MTA proteins in the NuRD complexes is not fully appreciated. Because of the abundant presence of the MTA family members in normal tissues, their NuRD corepressor complexes are presumed to target diverse genes affecting a variety of cellular pathways with roles in both normal and pathologic states. MTA proteins represent a small family of gene products encoded by three distinct genes with different chromosomal loci in humans, i.e. MTA1 at 14q32, MTA2 at 11q12-q13.1, and MTA3 at 2p21, and six reported isoforms (MTA1, MTA1s, MTA1-ZG29p, MTA2, MTA3, and MTA3L) (12Kumar R. Wang R.A. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Two homologues of the human MTA1 gene also exist in Caenorhabditis elegans, egl-27 and egr-1 (lin-40) (13Herman M.A. Ch'ng Q. Hettenbach S.M. Ratliff T.M. Kenyon C. Herman R.K. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Solari F. Bateman A. Ahringer J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among MTA family members, the expression pattern of MTA3 is restricted, whereas MTA1 and MTA2 are ubiquitously expressed. MTA1, the founding member of the MTA family of genes, was originally identified through differential screening of a cDNA library from rat metastatic breast tumors (15Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found a widespread up-regulation of MTA1 in human tumors (12Kumar R. Wang R.A. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 16Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Esteller M. DNA Methylation, Epigenetics, and Metastasis. Springer Link, Berlin2005: 215-230Google Scholar). Despite a strong correlation between MTA1 up-regulation and cancer, the molecular function of the MTA family remained a mystery until proteomic analyses of the NuRD complex identified MTA1 and MTA2 as integral subunits, thus providing essential clues to the chromatin-modifying roles of MTA proteins (17Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 18Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary structure of MTA proteins shows that human MTA2 and MTA3 are 68 and 73% identical to human MTA1, respectively, with the highest homology concentrated in the N-terminal half of the proteins (Fig. 1). In contrast, the C-terminal halves of MTA proteins are divergent. The MTA proteins (with the exception of the ZG29p variant) contain one BAH domain, one ELM domain, and one SANT domain that is similar to the DNA binding domain of Myb-related proteins. Our understanding of the functional significance of these domains in the MTA family is derived from studies of other proteins containing such domains. For example, the BAH domain is involved in protein-protein interactions (19Oliver A.W. Jones S.A. Roe S.M. Matthews S. Goodwin G.H. Pearl L.H. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 657-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), whereas the SANT domain binds to histone tails (20Grune T. Brzeski J. Eberharter A. Clapier C.R. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Muller C.W. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Also, all MTA family members contain a GATA zinc finger DNA binding domain (Fig. 1); MTA1 contains two bipartite nuclear localization signals and one basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal. MTA2 contains one basic amino acid-rich nuclear localization signal (using the PSORTII program) and thus predominantly localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 1). In human hepatocarcinoma (HCC) cells, MTA1 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasmic compartments (21Moon W.S. Chang K. Tarnawski A.S. Hum. Pathol. 2004; 35: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility of an NuRD complex-independent function of MTA1. Although the physical organization of MTA1, -2, and -3 is similar at the N terminus, the C terminus of MTA1 contains an Src homology 3 domain (11Yao Y.L. Yang W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42560-42568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which makes it the only MTA that could interact with signaling molecules. MTA1s is a C-terminal truncated variant of MTA1 that predominantly localizes to the cytoplasm of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cells (22Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). MTA1s is generated by alternative splicing at a cryptic splice site located in (or near) exon 14, resulting in the deletion of 47 nucleotides and the entire C-terminal portion of MTA1 and a translational frameshift leading to the addition of 33 novel amino acids that include a nuclear receptor (NR) interacting motif (NR box) (22Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Among other MTA family members, ZG29p is an N-terminal truncated form of MTA1 encoded by the last seven exons of MTA1 (23Kleene R. Zdzieblo J. Wege K. Kern H.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2539-2548PubMed Google Scholar). The ZG29p protein contains two nuclear localizing signals, but in contrast to MTA1, it is excluded from the nucleus by a mechanism that is yet to be identified. ZG29p occurs primarily in zymogen granules with a small amount appearing in the Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum (23Kleene R. Zdzieblo J. Wege K. Kern H.F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2539-2548PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data suggest the existence of multiple splice variants of MTA1 (24Yaguchi M. Wada Y. Toh Y. Iguchi H. Kono A. Matsusue K. Takiguchi S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1732: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). MTA3L is a longer form of MTA3 that contains 594 amino acids versus the 515 amino acids of MTA3 (25Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The mRNAs encoding MTA3 and MTA3L differ in their 3′-terminal exons and produce two highly similar proteins with unique carboxyl termini. Although the presence of MTA1/MTA2 in NuRD complexes provided clues about the role of MTA proteins in chromatin remodeling (17Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 18Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar), direct targets of MTAs remained unknown until the discovery that MTA1 directly interacts with ERα and represses its transactivation activity in an HDAC-sensitive manner (26Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the MTA1s variant was also found to inhibit ERα transactivation by sequestering ERα in the cytoplasm via a direct interaction between the ERα and the MTA1s NR box (22Kumar R. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Mandal M. Yang Z. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Sahin A. Hortobagyi G. Adam L. Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Nature. 2002; 418: 654-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). More recently, MTA2 was also found to suppress ERα transactivation activity (27Cui Y. Niu A. Pestell R. Kumar R. Curran E.M. Liu Y. Fuqua S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2020-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A deeper understanding of the corepressor activity of MTA1 upon the ERα pathway was revealed by the identification of three novel MTA1 binding partners that by themselves exerted coactivator function upon ERα transactivation. These MTA1-binding proteins are MAT1, a component of cyclin-dependent kinase-activated kinase complex (28Talukder A.H. Mishra S.K. Mandal M. Balasenthil S. Mehta S. Sahin A.A. Barnes C.J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11676-11685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), MICoA (29Mishra S.K. Mazumdar A. Vadlamudi R.K. Li F. Wang R.A. Yu W. Jordan V.C. Santen R.J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19209-19219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and NRIF3 (30Talukder A.H. Gururaj A. Mishra S.K. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6581-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, MTA1 interacts with LMO4 and facilitates the ability of LMO4 to transcriptionally repress ERα (31Singh R.R. Barnes C.J. Talukder A.H. Fuqua S.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10594-10601Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). LMO4, a member of the LIM-only family of transcriptional coregulatory proteins, consists of two LIM protein-protein interaction domains that enable it to interact with both ERα and its corepressor MTA1. These observations suggest that the functional status of ERα is regulated by association with different MTAs and their assorted binding proteins (Fig. 2). The C-terminal 33 amino acids of MTA1s bear no obvious resemblance to known protein motifs with the exception that they contain an NR box motif (-LRILL-). Recent studies using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggested an α-helical structure for this 33-amino acid sequence region (32Singh R.R. Kaluarachchi K. Chen M. Rayala S.K. Balasenthil S. Ma J. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 25612-25621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). MTA1s uses this motif to interact with the AF2 domain of ERα, leading to cytoplasmic sequestration of the receptor and, consequently, to inhibition of the genomic functions of ERα. Intriguingly, MTA1s is phosphorylated by CKI-γ2 in an anti-estrogen-dependent manner. Phosphorylation by CKI-γ2 potentiates the corepressor activity of MTA1s on ERα (33Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Mazumdar A. Talukder A.H. Larose L. Kumar R. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 4422-4429Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Recent findings suggest that MTA3 regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transitions by inhibiting the zinc finger transcriptional repressor, Snail (25Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Further MTA3 is downstream of the ERα pathway as ERα directly binds to the MTA3 promoter at the half-estrogen-response element/Sp1 binding site and regulates MTA3 transcription (34Fujita N. Kajita M. Taysavang P. Wade P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Mishra S.K. Talukder A.H. Gururaj A.E. Yang Z. Singh R.R. Mahoney M.G. Franci C.

Cell. 2003; 113: 142-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition to deacetylation of histones, the MTA1/2-HDAC complex interacts with and deacetylates non-histone proteins. MTA proteins deacetylate p53, HIF1α, and ERα (27Cui Y. Niu A. Pestell R. Kumar R. Curran E.M. Liu Y. Fuqua S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2020-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 38Yoo Y.G. Kong G. Lee M.O. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Deacetylated p53 results in decreased p53-dependent transcription, as deacetylation of p53 marks it for degradation through MDM2, leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis. Another non-histone target of the MTA1-HDAC complex for deacetylation is HIF-1α, a transcriptional regulator of hypoxia. MTA1 enhances the stability and transcriptional activity of HIF-1α under hypoxic conditions. The underlying mechanism involves MTA1 association and deacetylation of HIF-1α, leading to increased steady-state levels of HIF-1α due to resistance of deacetylated HIF-1α to ubiquitin-proteasome degradation (Fig. 3). It is important to note that deacetylation of HIF-1α protects from degradation whereas deacetylation of p53 promotes degradation. Because the acetylation status of ERα is closely linked to transactivation, a recent study found that the MTA2-HDAC complex involves deacetylation of ERα and modulates its transcriptional activity (27Cui Y. Niu A. Pestell R. Kumar R. Curran E.M. Liu Y. Fuqua S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 2020-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MTA1 Homologues in Embryonic Development—Coordinate regulation of transcription factors and coregulators is particularly important during embryonic development. Components of the NuRD complex appear to play a regulatory role during development in C. elegans (39von Zelewsky T. Palladino F. Brunschwig K. Tobler H. Hajnal A. Muller F. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 5277-5284PubMed Google Scholar). For example, inactivation of the MTA1 homologues egl-27 and egr-1 (also known as lin-40) in C. elegans leads to abnormal patterning of cells in the embryo, suggesting that EGL-27-containing complexes regulate the activity of transcription factors involved in embryonic patterning (14Solari F. Bateman A. Ahringer J. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, mutations in egl-27 lead to defects in cell polarity and migration in the worm (13Herman M.A. Ch'ng Q. Hettenbach S.M. Ratliff T.M. Kenyon C. Herman R.K. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EGR-1 and EGL-27 proteins in conjunction with NuRD components antagonize vulval development (39von Zelewsky T. Palladino F. Brunschwig K. Tobler H. Hajnal A. Muller F. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 5277-5284PubMed Google Scholar). EGR-1 (LIN-40) inhibits vulval fate specification by down-regulating lin-39 Hox expression, leading to enhanced cell fusion between vulval precursor cells and the hypodermal syncytium at an early larval stage (40Chen Z. Han M. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 4911-4921PubMed Google Scholar). These developmental studies highlight the importance of MTA coregulators in processes affecting developmental decisions such as cell migration, polarity, and pattern formation. MTA1 in Mouse Mammary Gland Development—A recent study showed that forced overexpression of MTA1 in the mouse mammary gland epithelium was accompanied by extensive ductal branching and proliferation in virgin glands, which was mechanistically linked to an altered ratio of progesterone receptor A and B isoforms (41Bagheri-Yarmand R. Talukder A.H. Wang R.A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These data suggest a role for MTA1 in mammary gland development. In older animals, MTA1 leads to the formation of mammary gland adenocarcinomas. Virgin mammary glands from MTA1 transgenic mice also exhibit up-regulation of β-catenin and cyclin D1, which may account for late stage tumor formation in these animals. Because β-catenin and cyclin D1 are indicators of an activated Wnt pathway, these findings raise an interesting possibility of cross-talk between MTA1 and the Wnt pathways. MTA3 Regulation of the Wnt Pathway—Despite a role for MTA3 in epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in cancer cell lines (25Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Kajita M. Geigerman C. Moreno C.S. Wade P.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 207-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), more recent data suggest that forced overexpression of MTA3 in the mammary epithelium leads to inhibition of ductal side branching in virgin glands because of reduced cell proliferation and differentiation (42Zhang H. Singh R.R. Talukder A.H. Kumar R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2943-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, MTA3-induced hypobranching in the mammary gland is mechanistically linked with the direct corepressor activity of the MTA3-HDAC complex on Wnt4 chromatin. These effects of MTA3 are opposite those of MTA1 in virgin mammary gland (41Bagheri-Yarmand R. Talukder A.H. Wang R.A. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 3469-3479Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These findings support the notion of physiological differences among the MTA family members and underscore the lack of functional redundancy among individual MTA proteins. Because the Wnt pathway controls the growth and differentiation of many organ systems, it will be important to know the potential contribution of MTA proteins in such tissues. MTA Family Members in Lymphocyte Fate Determination—In addition to EMT, MTA3 participates in B lymphocyte development (43Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Geigerman C. Akyildiz A. Mooney M.R. Boss J.M. Wade P.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), which is regulated in part by a negative feedback mechanism involving the transcriptional repression of BCL6 and Blimp-1 (44Staudt L.M. Nature. 2004; 431: 919-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Inhibition of BCL6 in germinal center B cells leads to derepression of Blimp-1, resulting in differentiation of these B cells into plasma cells. Such a “biological double circuit,” where BCL6 represses Blimp-1 expression and Blimp-1 represses BCL6 expression, controls B-cell differentiation (43Fujita N. Jaye D.L. Geigerman C. Akyildiz A. Mooney M.R. Boss J.M. Wade P.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 44Staudt L.M. Nature. 2004; 431: 919-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The MTA-dependent repression mechanism also participates in T-lymphocyte functions as MTA1 overexpression in T lymphocytes potentiates transcriptional repression mediated by BCL11B, whereas MTA1 depletion inhibits BCL11B transcriptional repression activity (45Cismasiu V.B. Adamo K. Gecewicz J. Duque J. Lin Q. Avram D. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6753-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition to the corepressor activities of MTA family members, a recent report suggests that MTA1 may also act as a coactivator of the breast cancer amplified sequence 3 (BCAS3) protein (46Gururaj A.E. Singh R.R. Rayala S.K. Holm C. den Hollander P. Zhang H. Balasenthil S. Talukder A.H. Landberg G. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this context, MTA1 is acetylated at lysine 626 by histone acetyltransferase p300. Interestingly, the lysine 626 site of MTA1 is not conserved in MTA2 or MTA3. The acetylated MTA1 and RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex are recruited onto the BCAS3 promoter in the vicinity of half-estrogen-response elements. It appears that MTA1 up-regulates BCAS3 gene expression by acting as a coactivator and thus may behave as a bifunctional coregulator. These findings raise the interesting possibilities that the corepressor versus coactivator activity of MTA1 may be influenced by MTA1 binding partners by posttranslational modifications of the protein and by promoter context. Although existing literature has identified a handful of downstream targets of MTA family proteins, knowledge of upstream regulators of the MTAs is limited. In this context, recent findings suggest that the expression of MTA3 in breast cancer cells is regulated by ERα and by AP1 and SP1 transcription factors (34Fujita N. Kajita M. Taysavang P. Wade P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Mishra S.K. Talukder A.H. Gururaj A.E. Yang Z. Singh R.R. Mahoney M.G. Franci C. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32709-32715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast to MTA3, the MTA2 promoter is regulated by ETS-1 and SP1 (47Xia L. Zhang Y. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Expression of MTA1 is up-regulated by heregulin beta 1, a ligand for the HER3 and HER4 receptors (26Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), as well as by hypoxia (38Yoo Y.G. Kong G. Lee M.O. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1231-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Further, c-Myc regulates the expression of MTA1 by directly interacting with its promoter, and MTA1 is required for Myc-mediated transformation of fibroblasts (48Zhang X.Y. DeSalle L.M. Patel J.H. Capobianco A.J. Yu D. Thomas-Tikhonenko A. McMahon S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13968-13973Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Clearly, additional studies are needed to identify the pathways or signals that control the expression of MTA family members. Recent developments in the area of MTA research have enriched our understanding of the role of this family of coregulators in transcriptional programs. Despite this progress, there are several urgent issues that deserve to be investigated in the future. These outstanding issues include the precise roles of MTA family proteins in NuRD complexes, the nature of post-translational modifications that MTA family members are capable of undergoing, the biochemical and cellular basis of the dual coregulatory activity of MTA1, the upstream regulators of expression of MTA family members, and the possibility that MTA proteins affect functions other than transcription; are there NuRD-complex-independent functions of MTA family members? As MTA1–3 contain GATA-like zinc finger DNA binding elements, it is very likely that MTA proteins may act as transcription factors by binding to specific DNA binding elements that are yet to be identified. Further it will be important to define the nature of genome-wide targets of MTA family members. In addition to the pathogenic roles of the MTA family, we must understand the physiologic functions of these proteins as they are widely expressed in normal tissues. Recent discoveries also raise the issue of whether this family of proteins should be renamed on the basis of structural motifs as the current “metastasis-associated genes” nomenclature is not reflective of the physiologic functions of this family of proteins. The functional significance of the MTA family of coregulators is just beginning to emerge and may prove to have a profound influence on biologic processes in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2065803563,"Mast cells (MCs) initiate protective immunity against bacteria. Here we demonstrate that MCs also contribute to the control of parasitic skin infections by Leishmania major. L. major-infected MC-deficient Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice developed markedly larger skin lesions than did normal Kit+/+ mice (>2-fold), and cutaneous reconstitution with MCs resulted in normalization of lesion development. Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) lesions contained significantly more parasites, and infections resulted in enhanced spreading of parasites to the spleens as compared to controls. In addition, recruitment of proinflammatory neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) in infected mice was MC dependent. In the absence of MCs, reduced numbers of lesional DCs were associated with decreased production of Th1-promoting interleukin (IL)-12. Antigen-specific T cell priming was delayed in Kit(W)/Kit(W-v) mice and cytokine responses were skewed towards Th2. Notably, local skin MC reconstitution at sites of infection was sufficient for the induction of systemic protection. Thus, MC-mediated control of L. major infections is not limited to the induction of local inflammation. Instead, MCs contribute significantly to local DC recruitment, which mediates protective immunity. These findings extend the view of MCs as salient sentinels of innate immunity to complex host defense reactions against intracellular pathogens."

This observation suggests that replication origins fire with a defined timing pattern that remains the same from cycle to cycle. However, an alterative model based on the stochastic firing of origins may also explain replication timing. This model assumes varying origin efficiency instead of a strict origin-timing programme. Here, we discuss the evidence for both models."

It induces Ca2+ influx in a subset of sensory neurons from dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia, due to activation of TRPM8, a Ca2+-permeable, cold-activated member of the TRP superfamily of cation channels. Menthol also induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in several TRPM8-expressing cell types, which has led to the suggestion that TRPM8 can function as an intracellular Ca2+-release channel. Here we show that menthol induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in four widely used cell lines (HEK293, lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and COS), and provide several lines of evidence indicating that this release pathway is TRPM8-independent: 1) menthol-induced Ca2+ release was potentiated at higher temperatures, which contrasts to the cold activation of TRPM8; 2) overexpression of TRPM8 did not enhance the menthol-induced Ca2+ release; 3) menthol-induced Ca2+ release was mimicked by geraniol and linalool, which are structurally related to menthol, but not by the more potent TRPM8 agonists icilin or eucalyptol; and 4) TRPM8 expression in HEK293 cells was undetectable at the protein and mRNA levels. Moreover, using a novel TRPM8-specific antibody we demonstrate that both heterologously expressed TRPM8 (in HEK293 cells) and endogenous TRPM8 (in LNCaP cells) are mainly localized in the plasma membrane, which contrast to previous localization studies using commercial anti-TRPM8 antibodies.

Finally, aequorin-based measurements demonstrate that the TRPM8-independent menthol-induced Ca2+ release originates from both endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments. Menthol is a naturally occurring compound responsible for the minty flavor and smell of the mint plant (Mentha piperita). Whereas the first descriptions of the use of menthol as a cooling/soothing compound and odorant date back to ∼2000 years ago, menthol is still extensively used as an additive in a wide variety of products ranging from ointments and candies to cigarettes. The soothing, refreshing and invigorating feature of the oil made from the peppermint herb is useful in massage for muscle fatigue. It is also used in the treatment of asthma, colic, exhaustion, fever, flatulence, headache, nausea, scabies, sinusitis, and vertigo (1Eccles R. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 618-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Currently the best described molecular target of menthol is TRPM8, 2The abbreviations used are: TRPM8, transient receptor potential melastatin family member 8; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; menthol, 2-(2-propyl)-5-methyl-1-cyclohexanol; HEK293, human embryonic kidney cells; LNCaP, lymph node carcinoma of the prostate; FCS, fetal calf serum; IP3R, inositol trisphosphate receptor; ACh, acetylcholine chloride; BHQ, 2,5-di-(tert-)-butyl-1,4-benzohydroquinone; AEQ, aequorin; KRB, Krebs-Ringer buffer. a member of the melastatin branch of the TRP superfamily of cation channels. TRPM8 was initially identified in a screening procedure aimed at identifying mRNAs that are up-regulated in prostate cancer (2Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, TRPM8 expression was also demonstrated to be strongly up-regulated in several other primary tumor types including breast, colon, lung, and skin (2Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). The following studies identified TRPM8 in a subset of dorsal root and trigeminal neurons (3Nealen M.L. Gold M.S. Thut P.D. Caterina M.J. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and found it to function as a plasma membrane Ca2+-permeable cation channel activated by cold temperatures (<28 °C) and by compounds such as menthol, eucalyptol, geraniol, linalool, and icilin (4McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 5Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I.

These findings strongly suggest that TRPM8 is involved in cold sensation by the somatosensory system, and provide a straightforward explanation for the cool sensation evoked by menthol. Yet, the function of TRPM8 in non-sensory cells and particularly its relation to the pathophysiology of cancer cells are currently unknown. Recent studies have suggested that TRPM8, besides its established function as a plasmalemmal channel, can also be found in the ER membrane of the androgenresponsive LNCaP prostate cell line, where it may function as a menthol- and cold-sensitive intracellular Ca2+-release channel (7Zhang L. Barritt G.J. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 8365-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Thebault S. Lemonnier L. Bidaux G. Flourakis M. Bavencoffe A. Gordienko D. Roudbaraki M. Delcourt P.

In addition, menthol-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores has been reported in other different cell types, including skeletal muscle (9Palade P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6142-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tracheal epithelial cells (10Takeuchi S. Tamaoki J. Kondo M. Konno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and dorsal horn neurons (11Tsuzuki K. Xing H. Ling J. Gu J.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that TRPM8 plays a more general role as an intra-cellular Ca2+ release channel. However, in the absence of TRPM8-deficient mice or TRPM8-specific inhibitors, equaling all menthol-induced Ca2+ responses to TRPM8 activation may be premature. Whereas performing simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings and intracellular Ca2+ measurements on HEK293 cells overexpressing human TRPM8, we observed that menthol not only activates plasma membrane TRPM8 currents, but also induces Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Our results demonstrate that this intracellular Ca2+ release originates from both ER and Golgi compartments, is not related to TRPM8 expression, and is also observed in several other widely used cell types, pointing to a more universal TRPM8-independent menthol-activated release pathway. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Sigma), 4 mm l-alanyl-l-glutamine (Glutamax™, Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and MEM non-essential amino acids (1 times) (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 10% (v/v) CO2.

Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA was performed with Ready-to-Go™ You-Prime-First-Strand-Beads (Amersham Biosciences) using random primers. Amplification of specific TRPM8 fragments was performed on a 50-μl PCR, containing Taq DNA polymerase buffer (50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% gelatin), 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 0.5 pmol of each of the specific TRPM8 or actin primers (see Table 1) and the cDNA. The cycling protocol comprised denaturation for 1 min at 95 °C, annealing for 1 min at 61 °C, and extension also for 1 min at 72 °C, for a total of 32 cycles. Each reaction product was run on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide coloration.TABLE 1Reverse transcriptase-PCR primers to probe HEK293 cells for TRPM8GenePrimerSize of ampliconForwardReversebpTRPM8 primer set 1TGTTTTGCCCAAGGAGGTGGCCACCTCCAGCGCTGCTC2000TRPM8 primer set 2TGTCCGCCTCTTTCTGGAGCTTATTCTGAAGAATGGCCCAG300TRPM8 primer set 3TGTTTTGCCCAAGGAGGTGGCAACCAGTTTCCAGACAAACG680ActinCGAAACTACCTTCAACTCCAGCAACTAAGTCATAGTCCGCC350 Open table in a new tab Protein Extractions and Differential Centrifugation—Whole cell extracts from TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells were prepared using cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) supplemented with 1.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors mixture (10 μg/ml leupeptin and antipain, 2 μg/ml chymostatin and pepstatin) as described in Ref. 12Cao L. Owsianik G. Becq F. Nilius B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. To investigate intracellular distribution of TRPM8, TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitors mixture) and subjected to differential centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 100,000 × g, using a protocol described in Ref. 13Vriens J.

Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay method (14Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J.

Protein samples (20 μg) were solubilized in a 3-fold concentrated sample buffer (240 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 6% SDS, 3% dithiothreitol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) by heating to 56 °C for 15 min and were subsequently separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Anti-TRPM8 Antibody Generation and Immunodetection— For immunodetection, two different anti-TRPM8 antibodies were used: we compared commercially available antiTRPM8 (Novus) to a newly generated anti-TRPM8 antibody designed in our laboratory. To generate the latter, rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved region in the TRPM8 C terminus (C + 1078MRHRFRQLDTKLNDL1092) coupled to the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Eurogentec). TRPM8 antibodies were purified from serum by peptide chromatography (Eurogentec). For characterizing the distribution of TRPM8 in different membrane fractions, nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) or polyvinylidene fluoride (Bio-Rad) membranes with separated proteins were probed with purified polyclonal rabbit anti-TRPM8 (1:2000 dilution), anti-plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (1:2000 dilution), or monoclonal mouse antiinositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) isoform 3 (1:1000 dilution) antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence and exposure to a Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences), using either anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:4000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). When required, the bound antibodies were removed using Re-Blot Plus mild antibodies stripping solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chemicon International, Inc.). Immunocytochemistry on TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells and LNCaP cells was performed as described previously (12Cao L. Owsianik G. Becq F. Nilius B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% fresh formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min (all incubation and washing steps throughout the experiments were in phosphate-buffered saline with the indicated supplementation). After 2 h blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, coverslips were incubated with anti-TRPM8 antibodies (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Secondary Alexa Fluor® 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used in a 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 1 h. Stained samples were treated with VectaShield® mounting medium containing 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) to retard photobleaching and visualize nuclei. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were performed in the whole cell configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik). Electrode resistance was between 2 and 5 mΩ and 60% of the series resistance was compensated. All experiments were performed at 33 °C and carried out between 16 and 24 h after transfection. The internal (pipette) solution contained (in mm) 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, and 0.2 Fura-2, buffered at pH 7.2 with CsOH. The extracellular solution consisted of (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. Stimulation of TRPM8 currents was realized by application of 1 mm menthol (Sigma) to the bath solution. Current-voltage relationships were measured from linear 400-ms voltage ramps from -100 to +100 mV, which were applied every 5 s from a holding potential of +20 mV with a sampling interval of 0.8 ms. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements—Intracellular Ca2+ was measured using a monochromator based system consisting of a Polychrome IV monochromator (TILL Photonics) with an additional TILL photonics photomultiplier, both controlled by Pulse software (HEKA Elektronik). Cells were loaded with Fura-2 by incubating them in the culture medium with 2 μm Fura-2/AM (TefLabs) for 20 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured at alternating wavelengths between 350 and 380 nm, corrected by subtraction of the background fluorescence, and expressed as the ratio R (F350/F380). The relationship between the fluorescence ratio R and the [Ca2+] was computed according to the Grynkiewicz equation (15Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Additional correction on the KD of Fura-2 was performed for the different temperatures as described before (16Paltauf-Doburzynska J. Graier W.F. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A SC-20 dual in-line heater/cooler (Warner Instruments) was used to control the temperature of the perfusate. A TA-29 thermistor (Thermometrics) positioned in close vicinity of the cell was used to monitor the bath temperature, which was recorded together with the fluorescent signal. The Ca2+-containing extracellular solution consisted of (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 10 HEPES, buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH. For the nominally Ca2+-free solution, CaCl2 was omitted. Different concentrations of menthol, linalool, geraniol, eucalyptol, or icilin were applied in this solution. Acetylcholine chloride (ACh) and 2,5-di-(tert-butyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone (BHQ) were applied at concentrations of 100 and 50 μm, respectively. Pertussis toxin, U73122, and caffeine were used at concentrations of 500 ng/ml, 10 μm, and 10 mm, respectively. All reagents were obtained from Sigma. A stock solution of menthol and icilin was first made in ethanol resulting in a final concentration of the solvent not exceeding 0.3%. Ethanol itself does not evoke any intracellular Ca2+ release at the concentrations used. Aequorin Measurements—HEK293 cells, seeded on 13-mm gelatin-coated coverslips, were transfected with the bioluminescent protein aequorin constructs, targeted for the ER, Golgi, or cytosol (erAEQ, goAEQ, and cytAEQ, respectively) using GeneJuice® transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Novagen). Experiments were performed at 37 °C 1 day after transfection on a confluent cell layer (17Missiaen L. Van Acker K. Van Baelen K. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Vanoevelen J. Dode L. Rizzuto R. Callewaert G. Cell Calcium. 2004; 36: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Prior to measuring ER- or Golgi-aequorin signals, the culture medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) ((in mm) 135 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 20 KH2PO4, 20 HEPES, and 5.5 glucose buffered at pH 7.4 with NaOH), containing 600 μm EGTA. Cells were incubated during 1 h with 5 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for Ca2+ depletion and with 5 μm coelenterazine for reconstitution of the active aequorin. The cells were then washed extensively with KRB supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1 mm EGTA. After superfusion of the cells with KRB supplemented with 100 μm EGTA, the stores were loaded by superfusion with a KRB solution containing 1 mm CaCl2. Finally, the cells were stimulated with 2 mm menthol diluted in the same solution. HEK293 cells transfected with cytAEQ were incubated during1hina5%CO2 incubator at 37 °C with 5 μm coelenterazine (wild type) diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% FCS. Measurements were performed in KRB supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and cells were stimulated with 2 mm menthol in the same solution. The light signal was collected by a low-noise photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu H7360-1, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) with a built-in amplifier-discriminator. The photomultiplier output was collected using a photon PCI-6601 counting board (National Instruments). Statistical Analysis—Group data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Overall statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. In the case of significance (p < 0.05), individual groups were compared by Student's unpaired t test. Statistics was performed with Origin 7.0 software (OriginLab Corp.). Menthol-induced Ca2+ Release in HEK293 Cells—In HEK293 cells overexpressing human TRPM8, extracellular application of menthol induces typical outwardly rectifying whole cell currents, which have been described in detail in previous studies (4McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar, 5Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). When combining whole cell patch clamp recordings at 33 °C in Ca2+-free extracellular solution with microfluorimetric Ca2+-measurements using Fura-2, we observed that 1 mm menthol not only induced robust outward current activation but also a significant rise in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (Fig. 1, A and B). Note the delay in the time course for the observed Ca2+ rise: TRPM8 current is already desensitizing due to the high menthol concentration when [Ca2+]i increases. As this set of experiments was performed in Ca2+-free extracellular solution, these findings indicate that the menthol-induced rise in [Ca2+]i originates from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Both the whole cell current amplitude and [Ca2+]i returned to the initial level upon wash-out of menthol. However, whereas whole cell TRPM8 currents can be repetitively activated by menthol in Ca2+-free solution (data not shown; see also Refs. 4McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar and 5Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Earley T.J. Dragoni I. McIntyre P. Bevan S. Patapoutian A. Cell. 2002; 108: 705-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), a rise in [Ca2+]i was only observed during the first menthol application (Fig. 2A, for second application of 1 mm menthol at 33 °C, Δ[Ca2+]i = 5 ± 2.3 nm, n = 6). This indicates that either the menthol-sensitive Ca2+ stores are fully depleted by a single application of 1 mm menthol, or alternatively that the menthol-sensitive intracellular Ca2+-release pathway becomes fully desensitized to menthol. As previous studies suggested that TRPM8 may act as a Ca2+-release channel on intracellular membranes, we investigated whether the menthol-induced rise in [Ca2+]i depended on TRPM8. We observed that in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ a response to menthol could be evoked in both TRPM8-transfected cells and in control, non-transfected cells. A typical time course for [Ca2+]i is shown in Fig. 2A. Both the absolute increase in [Ca2+]i(control Δ[Ca2+]i = 77 ± 12 nm; TRPM8, Δ[Ca2+]i = 53 ± 14 nm; p = 0.22) and the time course (control, t½ = 255 ± 50 s; TRPM8, t½ = 165 ± 24 s; p = 0.17) were not significantly different between nontransfected and TRPM8-overexpressing HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, overexpression of TRPM8 had no significant influence on the menthol-induced Ca2+ release, suggesting that overexpressed TRPM8 does not function as a Ca2+-release pathway in HEK293 cells. TRPM8 is not only activated by menthol but also by cooling, and the effects of cold and menthol on TRPM8 are known to reinforce each other. This is illustrated in the experiment shown in Fig. 2C, where a TRPM8-transfected cell bathed in Ca2+-containing solution was repeatedly stimulated with 10 μm menthol. At this low dose, menthol evokes a robust increase in [Ca2+]i at 23 °C, whereas very little response is observed at 33 °C. To compare the temperature sensitivity of TRPM8 with that of the menthol-induced Ca2+-release pathway, we measured menthol responses in both TRPM8-transfected and non-transfected HEK293 cells in Ca2+-containing solution at 23 and 33 °C (Fig. 2, C and D), and observed two striking differences. First, the menthol responses in non-transfected cells were of smaller amplitude and required higher menthol concentrations. No responses were detectable to concentrations <100 μm menthol (data not shown). Second, we found that the menthol response in non-transfected cells was strongly counteracted by lowering the bath temperature to 23 °C (Fig. 2D), opposite to what we observed for a low dose of menthol in the TRPM8-transfected cells (Fig. 2C). In TRPM8-transfected cells, the concentration for half-maximal response (EC50) increased from 33 ± 7 μm at 23 °C to 97 ± 2 μm at 33 °C. In addition, the maximal amplitude of the menthol response dropped from 3.5 μm at 23 °C to 2 μm at 33 °C (n = 4-7 for each data point) (Fig. 2E). We were unable to obtain EC50 values for the menthol response in non-transfected cells, as the responses did not saturate at the maximal menthol concentration that can be kept in solution (∼5 mm). Nevertheless, raising the temperature to 33 °C resulted in a 4-5-fold increase in the response to supramillimolar menthol concentrations, and induced significant responses at submicromolar menthol concentrations, which were not observed at 23 °C (n = 4-7 for each datapoint) (Fig. 2F). It should also be noted here that cooling down to 15 °C did not evoke a Ca2+ transient in non-transfected HEK293 cells (data not shown). TRPM8 Expression and Localization in HEK293 and LNCaP Cells—This opposite temperature dependence indicates that the endogenous menthol-sensitive Ca2+-release pathway differs from expressed TRPM8 at the thermodynamic level. However, solely based on these data we cannot fully exclude that HEK293 cells endogenously express TRPM8 protein on intracellular membranes with different temperature sensitivity than exogenous, overexpressed TRPM8. To rule out this possibility, we investigated the expression of TRPM8 in HEK293 cells at both the protein and mRNA levels. First, we performed Western blotting using a commercially available anti-TRPM8 antibody (Novus) to probe the presence of TRPM8 protein in whole cell extracts from non-transfected and TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells. Despite long exposures and the use of two different batches of antibody, we were unable to detect a clear band of the expected size in extracts from both non-transfected cells and TRPM8-transfected cells (Fig. 3A). As these results cast doubts about the applicability of the commercial anti-TRPM8 antibody in Western blotting, we produced and purified new anti-TRPM8 antibodies raised against a C-terminal epitope of TRPM8, 1078MRHRFRQLDTKLNDL1092. In whole cell extracts isolated from TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells, these anti-TRPM8 antibodies recognized a band of ∼120-125 kDa, which corresponds to the expected molecular mass of TRPM8 (Fig. 3B). No such band was detected in the whole cell extract isolated from non-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, non-transfected cells also did not display the TRPM8-specific immunodetection in low- and high-speed pellet membrane fractions obtained by differential centrifugation (Fig. 3C). In contrast, we found that more than 95% of TRPM8 was present in the low-speed pellet membranes obtained from TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). This fraction also contained the majority of the marker plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase 1 and a part of the ER membranes, indicated by IP3R detection. These data clearly demonstrate that our new antibody detects overexpressed TRPM8 in Western blots and that the overexpressed TRPM8 is present to a large extent in a plasma membrane-enriched fraction, indicating that a significant part of the exogenously expressed TRPM8 protein is localized in the plasma membrane, although it may also be present in intracellular membrane fractions. Next, we compared both antibodies in immunocytochemical staining of non-transfected and TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells as well as in LNCaP cells, which endogenously express TRPM8. As shown in Fig. 3D, our new antibodies specifically stained TRPM8-expressing HEK293 cells, with only little background staining of non-transfected cells. The TRPM8-specific detection was consistent with localization of TRPM8 in the plasma membrane, although some intracellular staining was sometimes evident. In striking contrast, staining of TRPM8-expressing HEK293 cells with the commercial anti-TRPM8 (Novus) antibody resulted in equal staining of both nontransfected and TRPM8-transfected HEK293 cells, and the staining pattern was consistent with an intracellular localization of the epitope(s) (Fig. 3F). As previous studies reporting that endogenous TRPM8 in LNCaP cells is to a large extent or even fully restricted to intracellular compartments used the commercial anti-TRPM8 antibodies (7Zhang L.

Here we analyze the mechanisms of RhoA regulation by serotonin (5-HT) in arterial smooth muscle. 5-HT (0.1–10 μm) induced activation of RhoA followed by RhoA depletion at 24–72 h. Inhibition of 5-HT1 receptors reduced the early phase of RhoA activation but had no effect on 5-HT-induced delayed RhoA activation and depletion, which were suppressed by the 5-HT transporter inhibitor fluoxetine and the transglutaminase inhibitor monodansylcadaverin and in type 2 transglutaminase-deficient smooth muscle cells. Coimmunoprecipitations demonstrated that 5-HT associated with RhoA both in vitro and in vivo. This association was calcium-dependent and inhibited by fluoxetine and monodansylcadaverin. 5-HT promotes the association of RhoA with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1, and 5-HT-induced RhoA depletion was inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the RhoA inhibitor Tat-C3. Simvastatin, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632, small interfering RNA-mediated RhoA gene silencing, and long-term 5-HT stimulation induced Akt activation.

Long-term 5-HT stimulation also led to the inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase component of arterial contraction. Our data provide evidence that 5-HT, internalized through the 5-HT transporter, is transamidated to RhoA by transglutaminase. Transamidation of RhoA leads to RhoA activation and enhanced proteasomal degradation, which in turn is responsible for Akt activation and contraction inhibition.

The observation of transamidation of 5-HT to RhoA in pulmonary artery of hypoxic rats suggests that this process could participate in pulmonary artery remodeling and hypertension. The small G proteins of the Rho family are identified as key signaling molecules in the vasculature. RhoA and its downstream effector Rho kinase have been shown to play a major role in vascular processes such as smooth muscle cell contraction, proliferation and differentiation, endothelial permeability, platelet activation, and leukocyte migration (1Loirand G. Guerin P. Pacaud P. Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 322-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 2van Nieuw Amerongen G.P. van Hinsbergh V.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Abnormal activation of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway has been observed in major cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy. The activity of RhoA is under the direct control of a large set of regulatory proteins (3Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). In the inactive GDP-bound form, RhoA is locked in the cytosol by guanine dissociation inhibitors (4Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328PubMed Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange factors catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate RhoA (5Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In the active GTP-bound form, RhoA translocates to plasma membrane, where it interacts with effectors to transduce the signal downstream. GTPase-activating proteins that hydrolyzed GTP to GDP then turn off activation. In addition to this activation/inactivation cycle, recent reports have proposed that regulation of Rho protein degradation could participate in the regulation of Rho protein functions. Phosphorylation of RhoA by cGMP-dependent protein kinase protects RhoA from ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation in vascular smooth muscle cells (6Rolli-Derkinderen M. Sauzeau V. Boyer L. Lemichez E. Baron C. Henrion D. Loirand G. Pacaud P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1152-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, constitutive activation of Rho proteins by the bacterial toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 enhances their ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation (7Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G.

To date, the relevance of this mechanism of Rho protein depletion in a physiological/pathophysiological context, in response to membrane receptor agonist stimulation, has not been addressed.In vascular physiology, Akt signaling has been shown to mediate survival signals of many angiogenic factors and plays central roles in the regulation of vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis (8Shiojima I.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2127-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Rebsamen M.C. Sun J. Norman A.W. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that Akt is negatively regulated by the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway in endothelial cells (14Ming X.F. Viswambharan H. Barandier C. Ruffieux J. Kaibuchi K. Rusconi S. Yang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8467-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Accordingly, Rho kinase inhibition leads to the activation of Akt (15Wolfrum S. Dendorfer A. Rikitake Y. Stalker T.J. Gong Y. Scalia R. Dominiak P. Liao J.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1842-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Indirect inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase activity could also account for the activation of Akt induced by statins (16Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Indeed, by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, statins prevent the formation of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate required for membrane translocation and activation of RhoA, which finally leads to the reduction of Rho kinase activity (17Laufs U. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Although both 5-HT receptors and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) could participate in the effect of 5-HT on vascular smooth muscle cell growth, the signaling pathways involved are not clearly established. Here we demonstrate that 5-HT, internalized through the 5-HTT, is transamidated to RhoA by transglutaminase (TG). Transamidation of RhoA leads to its activation and its rapid proteasomal degradation, which in turn is responsible for Akt activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Rat and mice (C57BL/6 and type 2 TG (TG2)-deficient (TG2–/–) mice (18De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar)) aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic dissociation as previously described (19Guibert C. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Marthan R. Savineau J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L450-L458PubMed Google Scholar).siRNA—The siRNA were introduced into vascular smooth muscle cells by electroporation (Nucleofector, Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sense and antisense strands of siRNAs (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) used were: RhoA, sense 5′-GAAGUCAAGCAUUUCUGUCdTdT-3′, antisense 5′-GACAGAAAUGCUUGACUUCdTdT-3′; scrambled, sense 5′-GCCUGUGAUGACUACAGACdTdT-3′, antisense 5′-GUCUGUAGUCAUCACAGGCdTdT-3′. Efficiency and specificity of RhoA-siRNA have been validated by real-time quantitative PCR performed in the iCycler iQ™ detection system (Bio-Rad) using Sybr green detection (Molecular Probes). PCR primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys and Titanium™ Taq DNA polymerase (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The scrambled siRNA had no effect on RhoA mRNA. In contrast, RhoA-siRNA (1.2 μg/ml each strands) decreased the RhoA mRNA level by 80 ± 2 and 70 ± 5% at 24 and 48 h (n = 4), respectively, without effect on other members of the Rho family: RhoB, Rac1, and Rnd3.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing 1% Triton, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Nuclei and unlysed cells were removed by low speed centrifugation. Total protein samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal antibody against RhoA (1:200), polyclonal antibody against phosphoserine 473 of Akt (1:1000), polyclonal antibody against Akt (1:1000), polyclonal antibody against phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN; 1:1000) or polyclonal antibody against phospho-PTEN (serine 380/threonine 382/383; 1:1000) (P-PTEN). β-Actin antibody was used as loading control. Signals from immunoreactive bands were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified using QuantityOne (Bio-Rad).Coimmunoprecipitation—Cells were harvested in NETF buffer (100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaF) containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm orthovanadate, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Samples were precleared with 40 μl of protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (which have been washed in NETF buffer to give a 50% slurry), and immunoprecipitations were carried out with monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody or polyclonal anti-Smurf1 antibody preadsorbed on protein A- or G-Sepharose beads. The protein A/G-Sepharose-bound immune complexes were washed twice in NETF buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (1% w/v) and once in NETF without detergent. Pellets from the immunoprecipitations were heated at 95 °C for 5 min in 70 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblot for 5-HT or RhoA. Signals from immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using QuantityOne.Measurement of RhoA Activity—RhoA activity was assessed in homogenized cell samples by pulldown assays using the Rho binding domain of the Rho effector Rhotekin as described previously (20Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). Precipitated GTP-bound RhoA and total RhoA were then analyzed by Western blotting. Signals from immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using QuantityOne.Two-dimension Electrophoresis—Vascular smooth muscle cells were washed 3 times with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4 and scraped directly in UTC buffer (8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 150 μl per 2 × 106 cells). Protein concentration was determined by commercial Bio-Rad protein assay, and aliquots of 100 μg were stored at –80 °C until use. Samples were applied on a 7-cm IPG strip, pH 3–10, linear gradient (Immobiline Dry Strip, GE Healthcare) for 12 h of passive rehydration in Ettan IPGphor3 Manifold (GE Healthcare). After isoelectric focusing (Ettan IPGphor3, GE Healthcare), the strips were equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 30%glycerol, 2% SDS, and 1% dithiothreitol for 15 min and the same buffer in which DTT was replaced by 2.5% iodoacetamide. The equilibrated IPG strips were transferred on 12% acrylamide gel for second dimension and Western blot analysis as described above.Hypoxia—The hypoxic rats were housed in a hypobaric chamber at 380 mm Hg (Vacucell 111 L, Medcenter, Munich, Germany) for 2 days. Fluoxetin (20 mg/kg/day) was administrated by gavage for 2 days in control (normoxic) and hypoxic rats. At completion of the exposure to hypoxia, aorta and pulmonary arteries were removed and prepared as indicated for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses.Contraction Measurements—The aorta was collected in physiological saline solution (130 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 11 mm glucose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with HCl) cleaned of fat and adherent connective tissue and cut in rings. The endothelium was carefully removed by gently rubbing the intimal surface with the tip of small forceps. Rings were then incubated for 48 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at 37 °C in an incubator in the absence or presence of 10 μm 5-HT and in the presence of 1 μm GR 127936 and 10 μm mianserin. Arterial rings were then suspended under sometric conditions and connected to a force transducer (Pioden Controls Ltd., Canterbury, UK) in organ baths filled with Krebs-Henseleit solution (118.4 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose) maintained at 37 °C and equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2. Calcium-dependent contractions were induced by stimulation with 60 mm KCl. Cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed in response to U46619. Amplitude of the contraction was expressed as a percentage of the maximal 60 mm KCl-induced contraction.Chemicals and Drugs—Mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA antibody (26C4) and goat polyclonal anti-Smurf1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Akt, anti-phosphorylated-Akt, anti-PTEN, and anti-P-PTEN were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Ozyme, Saint Quentin, France). Anti-5HT1B/1D receptor antibody was from Novus Biological (Interchim, Montluçon, France), and the anti-5-HTT antibody was from Chemicon (Hampshire, UK) The permeant RhoA inhibitor Tat-C3 protein was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as already described (21Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 22Sauzeau V.

All other reagents, including 5-HT (hydrochloride), rabbit polyclonal anti-5-HT, and anti-5-HT2B receptor antibodies, were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France).Statistics—All results are expressed as the means ± S.D. of sample size n. Significance was tested by analysis of variance or Student's t test.RESULTSLong-term 5-HT Stimulation Induces 5-HTT- and TG-dependent RhoA Activation—RhoA activity has been determined by pulldown assay in aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated by 5-HT. Results shown in Fig. 1A indicate that 5-HT applied for 10 min dose-dependently (0.1–10 μm) activated RhoA. This stimulation of RhoA activity could result either from 5HT1, 5HT2 receptor, or 5-HTT activation, which were all expressed in cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1B). The use of selective inhibitors revealed that the pharmacological profile of 5-HT-induced RhoA activation depended on the concentration and the duration of 5-HT stimulation. Time-course analysis showed that 5-HT-induced RhoA activation was maintained (Fig. 1C). Maximal RhoA activation induced by 0.1 μm 5-HT (2.10 ± 0.16-fold over control, n = 5) was observed after 3 min of stimulation, whereas 10 min were required to reach maximal RhoA activation in the presence of 10 μm 5-HT (2.60 ± 0.18-fold over control, n = 5) (Fig. 1C). Activation of RhoA induced by short-term stimulation (3–10 min) with 0.1 μm 5-HT was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibition of 5-HT1B/1D receptor by the GR 127935 (1 μm) but was unaffected by the inhibition of 5-HT2A receptor by mianserin (10 μm) or 5-HTT by fluoxetine (10 μm), suggesting that the first phase of RhoA activation only depended on 5-HT1B/1D receptor activation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, at 60 min RhoA activation induced by 0.1 μm 5-HT was partially inhibited by GR 127935 and fluoxetine, indicating that both 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HTT were involved in the delayed activation of RhoA (Fig. 1C). In the presence of 10 μm 5-HT, activation of RhoA at 3 min essentially depended on 5-HT1B/1D receptor (Fig. 1C). However, the involvement of 5-HTT occurred earlier than that observed with 0.1 μm as fluoxetine inhibited RhoA activation induced by 10 min of stimulation with 10 μm 5-HT (Fig. 1C). These results, thus, indicate that 5-HT1B/1D receptor was responsible for early 5-HT-induced RhoA activation, whereas delayed RhoA activation induced by longer 5-HT stimulation was due to 5-HTT, the involvement of which was favored at high 5-HT concentration. The delayed participation of 5-HTT to RhoA activation by 0.1 μm 5-HT could be related to reduced intracellular 5-HT accumulation (Fig. 1C).The 5-HTT allows internalization of 5-HT that can then be used as substrate for TG, and it has been recently demonstrated that TG can transamidate Glu-63 of RhoA, leading to its constitutive activation (23Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We, therefore, analyzed the potential involvement of TG in the activation of RhoA induced by 5-HT by using the pharmacological TG inhibitor monodansylcadaverin (MDC, 200 μm). Inhibition of TG mimicked the effect of fluoxetine because it prevented 5-HT-induced delayed RhoA activation (Fig. 1C), suggesting that it was mediated by transamidation.5-HT Binds to RhoA—If 5-HT-induced RhoA activation was due to TG-mediated transamidation of RhoA, 5-HT should be covalently linked to RhoA (24Schmidt G. Selzer J. Lerm M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13669-13674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 25Walther D.J. Peter J.U. Winter S. Holtje M. Paulmann N.

To address this hypothesis, we first used two-dimension gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). RhoA immunoblotting after two-dimension gel electrophoresis of total protein extracts derived from aortic smooth muscle cells revealed that 5-HT induced a shift of the RhoA spot to alkaline pH without a change in the molecular mass, ∼21 kDa (Fig. 2A). Under control conditions, a single RhoA positive spot was detected at pH 4. In the presence of 5-HT, another RhoA spot appeared at a pH close to 6. The density of this second spot increased with the duration of 5-HT application becoming the major spot after 120 min. Western blot with an anti-5-HT antibody showed that in the absence of 5-HT and after 10 min of 5-HT stimulation, there was no 5-HT positive spot in the range of 18–50 kDa (Fig. 2A). However, a positive spot, corresponding to the more alkaline RhoA spot appeared at 30 and 120 min of 5-HT stimulation. To directly assess the binding of 5-HT to RhoA, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 2B). In RhoA precipitated from cells stimulated for 0–120 min with 5-HT, a Western blot with a specific anti-5-HT antibody revealed an immunoreactive band at ∼21 kDa, which corresponded to the molecular mass of RhoA. The amount of 5-HT that coimmunoprecipitated with RhoA increased with the time of 5-HT application. Inhibition of 5-HT1 receptor by GR 127935 or 5-HT2 receptor by mianserin did not alter 5-HT/RhoA interaction (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in the presence of fluoxetine or MDC, the amount of 5-HT that coimmunoprecipitated with RhoA was extremely low, indicating that inhibition of the 5-HTT or TG prevented 5-HT binding to RhoA (Fig. 2C).FIGURE 25-HT binds RhoA. A, protein extracts of aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated with 10 μm 5-HT for 0–120 min were separated by two-dimension gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot (WB) analysis using anti-RhoA and anti-5-HT antibodies. B and C, RhoA was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-RhoA antibody in lysates from cells stimulated for 10 μm 5-HT for 0–120 min (B) and for 30 min in the absence or in the presence of GR 127935 (1 μm), mianserin (10 μm), fluoxetine (10 μm), or MDC (200 μm)(C). 5-HT binding was assessed using anti-5-HT antibody. D, Western blotting with anti-5-HT antibody of immunoprecipitated RhoA from aortic smooth muscle cells of control (TG2+/+) and TG2–/– mice in the absence and presence of 10 μm 5-HT for 30 min. E, Western blotting with anti-5-HT antibody of immunoprecipitated RhoA from rat aortic smooth muscle cells stimulated with 10 μm 5-HT for 30 and 120 min in the absence and the presence of BAPTA-AM (30 μm), added 30 min before 5-HT stimulation. F, Western blotting with anti-5-HT antibody of immunoprecipitated RhoA from rat pulmonary artery and aorta of normoxic (0 days) or hypoxic rats (2 days hypoxia) treated or not with fluoxetine. Equal amounts of RhoA were confirmed by Western blot with anti-RhoA antibody (B–F). The data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The TG2, identified as the most interesting member of the TG family (26Lorand L. Graham R.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), has been shown to be expressed in smooth muscle cells (27Thomazy V. Fesus L. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To further analyze TG-mediated 5-HT binding to RhoA, 5-HT stimulation was applied to aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from TG2–/– mice (18De Laurenzi V. Melino G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot experiments indicated that stimulation with 5-HT for 30 min induced association of 5-HT to RhoA in cells from control mice but not in cells isolated from TG2–/– mice, suggesting that transamidation of RhoA was mediated by TG2 (Fig. 2D). TG2 is predominantly a cytosolic protein catalyzing Ca2+-dependent protein modifications (28Fesus L. Piacentini M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). To address a potential role of Ca2+ in 5-HT-induced TG2-mediated 5-HT/RhoA association, we used the cell-permeable Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. As shown in Fig. 2E, treatment of rat aortic smooth muscle cells with BAPTA-AM completely prevented 5-HT attachment to RhoA. These results, thus, provide direct evidence for Ca2+-dependent transamidation of intracellular 5-HT to RhoA by TG2 in vascular smooth muscle cells.5-HT Binds to RhoA in Vivo—We next assessed whether transamidation of intracellular 5-HT to RhoA occurred in arteries in vivo. 5-HT and 5-HTT have been shown to participate in the development of hypoxia-induced pulmonary remodeling and hypertension (29Eddahibi S. Fabre V. Boni C. Martres M.P. Raffestin B. Hamon M. Adnot S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 30Fanburg B.L. Lee S.L. J. Clin.

Investig. 2001; 108: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), which also involved RhoA activation (32Guilluy C. Sauzeau V. Rolli-Derkinderen M. Guerin P. Sagan C. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 146: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hypoxia up-regulated 5-HTT expression and enhanced 5-HT uptake in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (29Eddahibi S. Fabre V. Boni C. Martres M.P. Raffestin B. Hamon M. Adnot S. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 33Lee S.L. Dunn J. Yu F.S. Fanburg B.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We, therefore, analyzed 5-HT/RhoA association in aorta and pulmonary arteries of rat maintained in hypoxic condition for 2 days. Hypoxia induced binding of 5-HT to RhoA in pulmonary artery but not in aorta (Fig. 2F). This effect was blocked by fluoxetine, indicating the role of 5-HTT (Fig. 2F). This result, thus, provides evidence that 5-HTT-dependent transamidation of 5-HT to RhoA exists in arteries in vivo.5-HT Induces RhoA Depletion by Stimulation of Its Proteasomal Degradation—Transamidated RhoA is constitutively active (23Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and constitutively active RhoA has been shown to be subject to rapid proteasomal degradation (7Doye A. Mettouchi A. Bossis G. Clement R. Buisson-Touati C. Flatau G. Gagnoux L. Piechaczyk M. Boquet P. Lemichez E. Cell. 2002; 111: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). It could, thus, be expected that maintained stimulation with 5-HT should promote decrease of RhoA expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. To address this hypothesis, we performed time-course analysis of RhoA expression by Western blot in the absence and presence of 5-HT for up to 72 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, 5-HT induced a time-dependent depletion of RhoA. Analysis of RhoA mRNA by real-time PCR indicated that there was no change in the amount of RhoA mRNA in the presence of 5-HT (not shown). This decrease in RhoA expression is not a general phenomenon in response to long-term stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with vasoconstrictors as application of other RhoA-activating vasoconstricting agents such as angiotensin II, endothelin 1, or the thromboxane A2 analog U46619, at concentrations producing maximal contraction for 72 h, had no effect on RhoA expression (Fig. 3B). RhoA depletion was observed in response to 5-HT concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm, similar to those inducing RhoA activation (Fig. 3C). The inhibitory effect of 5-HT on RhoA expression was blocked by fluoxetine and by MDC, indicating that it depended on transamidation of intracellular 5-HT (Fig. 3D). In addition, 5-HT-induced depletion of RhoA was also prevented by the inhibition of RhoA activity by Tat-C3 (20 μg/ml) (Fig. 3D). In mouse aortic smooth muscle cells, 5-HT stimulation for 48 or 72 h induced RhoA depletion similar to that described in rat cells. However, this effect of 5-HT was completely lost in smooth muscle cells from TG2–/– mice (Fig. 3E). Together, these results, thus, suggest that 5-HT-induced RhoA depletion was the consequence of RhoA activation by transamidation of intracellular 5-HT by TG2.FIGURE 35-HT induces depletion of RhoA.

However, when males possess traits that could enhance the reproductive success of sons, males would also benefit from the manipulation of the offspring sex ratio. We tested the prediction that more-fertile red deer males produce more sons. Our findings reveal that male fertility is positively related to the proportion of male offspring. We also show that there is a positive correlation between the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa (a main determinant of male fertility) and the proportion of male offspring. Thus, males may contribute significantly to biases in sex ratio at birth among mammals, creating the potential for conflicts of interest between males and females."
https://openalex.org/W2037152904,"We investigated the neuroprotective property of analogs of dextromethorphan (DM) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) models to identify neuroprotective drugs for Parkinson's disease (PD). In vivo studies showed that daily injections with DM analogs protected dopamine (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and restored DA levels in striatum using two different models for PD. Of the five analogs studied, 3-hydroxymorphinan (3-HM), a metabolite of DM, was the most potent, and restored DA neuronal loss and DA depletion up to 90% of the controls. Behavioral studies showed an excellent correlation between potency for preventing toxin-induced decrease in motor activities and neuroprotective effects among the DM analogs studied, of which 3-HM was the most potent in attenuating behavioral damage. In vitro studies revealed two glia-dependent mechanisms for the neuroprotection by 3-HM. First, astroglia mediated the 3-HM-induced neurotrophic effect by increasing the gene expression of neurotrophic factors, which was associated with the increased acetylation of histone H3. Second, microglia participated in 3-HM-mediated neuroprotection by reducing MPTP-elicited reactive microgliosis as evidenced by the decreased production of reactive oxygen species. In summary, we show the potent neuroprotection by 3-HM in LPS and MPTP PD models investigated. With its high efficacy and low toxicity, 3-HM may be a novel therapy for PD."

We present results for 17 type Ia supernovae that allow a statistical study of the correlation among the geometric structures and other observable parameters of type Ia supernovae. These observations suggest that type Ia supernova ejecta typically consist of a smooth, central, iron-rich core and an outer layer with chemical asymmetries. The degree of this peripheral asphericity is correlated with the light-curve decline rate of type Ia supernovae. These results lend strong support to delayed-detonation models of type Ia supernovae."
https://openalex.org/W2138987038,"The yeast prion [PSI+] is a self-propagating amyloidogenic isoform of the translation termination factor Sup35. Overproduction of the chaperone protein Hsp104 results in loss of [PSI+]. Here we demonstrate that this effect is decreased by deletion of either the gene coding for one of the major yeast ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc4, or the gene coding for the ubiquitin-recycling enzyme, Ubp6. The effect of ubc4Δ on [PSI+] loss was increased by depletion of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssb but was not influenced by depletion of Ubp6. This indicates that Ubc4 affects [PSI+] loss via a pathway that is the same as the one affected by Ubp6 but not by Ssb. In the presence of Rnq1 protein, ubc4Δ also facilitates spontaneous de novo formation of [PSI+]. This stimulation is independent of [PIN+], the prion isoform of Rnq1. Numerous attempts failed to detect ubiquitinated Sup35 in the yeast extracts. While ubc4Δ and other alterations of ubiquitin system used in this work cause slight induction of some Hsps, these changes are insufficient to explain their effect on [PSI+]. However, ubc4Δ increases the proportion of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa bound to Sup35, suggesting that misfolded Sup35 is either more abundant or more accessible to the chaperones in the absence of Ubc4. The proportion of [PSI+] cells containing large aggregated Sup35 structures is also increased by ubc4Δ. We propose that UPS alterations induce an adaptive response, resulting in accumulation of the large “aggresome”-like aggregates that promote de novo prion generation and prion recovery from the chaperone treatment.

However, ubc4Δ increases the proportion of the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa bound to Sup35, suggesting that misfolded Sup35 is either more abundant or more accessible to the chaperones in the absence of Ubc4. The proportion of [PSI+] cells containing large aggregated Sup35 structures is also increased by ubc4Δ. We propose that UPS alterations induce an adaptive response, resulting in accumulation of the large “aggresome”-like aggregates that promote de novo prion generation and prion recovery from the chaperone treatment. Prions are infectious aggregated protein isoforms that cause fatal and incurable neurodegenerative diseases such as sheep scrapie and “mad cow” diseases in mammals and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). The pathology of prion diseases is reminiscent of the other noninfectious amyloidoses and protein assembly disorders associated with amyloid-like protein aggregation, such as Alzheimer, Huntington, and Parkinson diseases (2Mayer R.J. Drug News Perspect. 2003; 16: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Soto C. Estrada L. Castilla J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 150-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Degradation of abnormal or damaged proteins occurs, at least in part, via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) 4The abbreviations used are: UPS, ubiquitin-proteasome system; Ub, ubiquitin; Ubc, Ub-conjugating enzyme; Ubp, Ub-specific processing protease(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; GuHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; HA, hemagglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (4Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar). Targeting of a protein for degradation to the proteasome requires its conjugation to a 76-amino acid protein named ubiquitin (Ub) through the sequential action of several enzymes, including the Ub-conjugating enzymes (Ubc). This process can be reversed by the action of various deubiquitinating enzymes, including Ub-specific processing proteases (Ubp) that disassemble Ub conjugates and release free Ub (5Wilkinson K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Mutations in different UPS components have been found to be associated with Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases (6Glickman M.H. Ciechanover A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 373-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). UPS failure can lead to aggregation of impaired proteins; in turn, aggregate formation is known to inhibit UPS function (7Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Although proteasome inhibitors affect the turnover of mammalian prion proteins, and Ub is found in intracellular deposits of prion aggregates (8Yedidia Y. Horonchik L. Tzaban S. Yanai A. Taraboulos A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5383-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Ma J. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2006; 347: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the role of Ub-mediated proteolysis in prion formation is not defined. Several yeast proteins possess prion properties (11Chernoff Y.O. Mutat. Res. 2001; 488: 39-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Chernoff Y.O. Curr. Opin. Chem.

All known yeast prions contain QN-rich stretches, somewhat resembling poly(Q) stretches involved in aggregation disorders such as Huntington disease. Unlike the mammalian prion protein PrP, yeast prions do not kill cells, although some of them appear to be pathogenic in a longer run (14Chernoff Y.O. Galkin A.P. Lewitin E. Chernova T.A. Newnam G.P.

Prion formation can antagonize the normal cellular function of a yeast protein, thus producing changes in phenotype that mimic conventional loss-of-function mutations. The yeast non-Mendelian element [PSI+] is a prion isoform of the yeast translation termination factor Sup35. [PSI+] cells are partially defective in termination of translation. [PIN+], a prion isoform of another protein of yet unknown function, Rnq1 (17Sondheimer N. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is usually needed for the de novo formation of [PSI+] but not for propagation of pre-existing [PSI+] (18Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Masse S.V. Zadorsky S.P. Polozkov G.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G.

Cell. 2001; 106: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The propagation of yeast prions is modulated by chaperone proteins of the Hsp100 and Hsp70 families (11Chernoff Y.O. Mutat. Res. 2001; 488: 39-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Chernoff Y.O. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 665-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The chaperone protein Hsp104, an ATPase known to promote solubilization of aggregated heat-damaged proteins in cooperation with other chaperones (22Shorter J. Lindquist S. Science. 2004; 304: 1793-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), is required for maintenance of all known yeast prions, possibly due to its ability to break prion aggregates into the oligomeric seeds, initiating new rounds of prion propagation. Transient overproduction of Hsp104 also cures yeast cells of [PSI+], although not of the other prions. Ssa proteins of the Hsp70 family also play an important role in prion propagation. Ssa overproduction antagonizes [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 and promotes de novo [PSI+] formation in the [PIN+] strains (23Allen K.D. Wegrzyn R.D. Chernova T.A. Muller S. Newnam G.P. Winslett P.A. Wittich K.B. Wilkinson K.D. Chernoff Y.O. Genetics. 2005; 169: 1227-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 24Newnam G.P. Wegrzyn R.D. Lindquist S.L. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1325-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), while Ssa mutations destabilize [PSI+] (25Jung G. Jones G. Wegrzyn R.D. Masison D.C. Genetics. 2000; 156: 559-570PubMed Google Scholar). Another chaperone of the Hsp70 family, Ssb, consistently manifests itself as a [PSI+] antagonist (26Chernoff Y.O. Newnam G.P. Kumar J. Allen K. Zink A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8103-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Hsp40 chaperones that act as co-chaperones of Hsp70s were shown to control propagation of [PIN+] (27Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and modulate aggregation of heterologous poly(Q) proteins in yeast (28Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E.

Chem. 2005; 280: 22809-22818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Mechanisms of the chaperone effects on prions are not yet completely understood. As some of the chaperones of Hsp70 and Hsp40 families were implicated in targeting misfolded proteins for Ubdependent degradation (30Ohba M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Lee D.H. Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it is possible that some of the effects of chaperones on prions could be mediated by UPS. We employed [PSI+] as a model to analyze the possible involvement of the UPS in modulation of prion formation, propagation, and clearance. Previously, we have shown that depletion of cellular Ub levels (by deleting the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6) decreases both the phenotypic manifestation of [PSI+] and de novo induction of [PSI+] by overproduced Sup35 protein in the [PIN+] background (32Chernova T.A.

Here, we demonstrate that both ubp6Δ and deletion of a gene coding for the major yeast Ub-conjugating enzyme, Ubc4, antagonize [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104. Moreover, ubc4Δ also significantly increased spontaneous formation of [PSI+]. Our data implicate the UPS as one of the major modulators of prion formation and clearance in the yeast cells. Yeast Strains—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. GT81-1C and GT81-1D, isogenic haploid strains that derived from self-homozygous diploid GT81 (14Chernoff Y.O. Galkin A.P. Lewitin E. Chernova T.A. Newnam G.P. Belenkiy S.M. Mol.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The [psi- PIN+] and [psi- pin-] derivatives resulted from curing the isogenic [PSI+] strains by overproduction of Hsp104 or guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) treatment, respectively (33Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of the single deletion strains used were constructed for this study by one step PCR-mediated direct gene replacement with the pFA6a-His3MX6 module (34Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1979; 8: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Media and Growth Conditions—Standard yeast media, cultivation conditions, procedures for yeast growth, transformation, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were used (43Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. A Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise specified. Gal medium contained 2% galactose instead of glucose. Gal+Raf medium contained 2% galactose and 2% raffinose instead of glucose. To induce expression of genes under the PCUP1 promoter, CuSO4 (50 or 100 μm) was added to the media. For drug sensitivity assay, strains were grown on YPD medium to an A600 of 1.0, and 2.5 μl of serial 10-fold dilutions were plated on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) medium with anisomycin (20 μg/ml). Growth on the plates was recorded after 2 and 5 days. The presence of [PSI+] was monitored by its ability to suppress the reporter allele ade1–14 (UGA) as described previously (33Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the absence of [PSI+], ade1–14 cultures develop red color on YPD and are unable to grow on -Ade medium. In the presence of [PSI+], these cultures develop light pink or white color on YPD and are able to grow on -Ade medium. Assays for [PSI+] Curing—Assays for [PSI+] curing by GuHCl were performed as described previously (33Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure [PSI+] curing by overproduced Hsp104, yeast cultures were transformed with the Hsp104 expression vectors or empty control vectors and analyzed as outlined below. For plate assays with the plasmids expressing Hsp104 from the endogenous (PHSP104) or constitutively active (PGPD) promoters, plasmid-containing cultures were grown on the medium selective for the plasmid and then velveteen replica plated onto the medium not selective for the plasmid and lacking adenine or onto YPD medium. For plate assays with the galactose-inducible (PGAL) promoter, cultures were grown on selective medium containing Gal and then velveteen replica-plated onto selective media containing glucose but lacking adenine or onto YPD medium. For all plasmids, the efficiency of [PSI+] curing was assessed by decreased growth on -Ade medium and increased intensity of red color on YPD medium compared with the control cultures. For quantitative assays, yeast cultures containing the plasmids bearing HSP104 under PGAL promoter were pregrown in selective medium containing glucose and then inoculated into the Gal+Raf medium of the same composition and grown with shaking (200–250 rpm) at 30 °C. Aliquots were taken after specified periods of time and plated onto selective medium containing glucose. The colonies grown after 4–5 days were velveteen replica-plated onto YPD and -Ade medium. [PSI+] retention or loss was scored by color on YPD and growth on -Ade. Assays for [PSI+] Formation—Plate assays and quantitative assays for spontaneous [PSI+] formation were performed as described previously (26Chernoff Y.O. Newnam G.P. Kumar J. Allen K. Zink A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8103-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Rates of spontaneous [PSI+] formation and confidence limits were calculated by using the formulas used previously for measuring the rates of spontaneous mutations (44Drake J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis and Antibodies—For measuring the levels of Sup35, chaperone proteins, and Ub, yeast cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads (Sup35 and chaperones) or by boiling in SDS loading buffer (Ub) according to protocols described previously (24Newnam G.P.

Co-imunoprecipitation assays for detection of Sup35 and Ssa interaction were performed using immobilized protein A (Invitrogen) according to the published protocol (23Allen K.D. Wegrzyn R.D.

A ubiquitinated protein enrichment kit (Calbiochem EMD Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to search for ubiquitinated Sup35 according to the manufacturer protocol. Total protein extracts and immunoprecipitates were examined by Western analysis using specific antibodies. Antibodies to Sup35NM were obtained as described previously (41Wegrzyn R.D. Bapat K. Newnam G.P. Zink A.D. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4656-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and antibodies to Sup35C were the generous gift of D. Bedwell. Antibodies to Hsp104 were kindly provided by S. Lindquist. Antibodies to total Ssa, Ssa3/4, and Ssb were generously provided by E. A. Craig. Antibodies to Ydj1 and Sis1 were kindly provided by D. Cyr. We used anti-Ub antibody P4D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), HA-specific antibody 12CA5 from Maine Biotechnology Services, anti-Pgk antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and anti-c-Myc antibody (Ab-1) from Calbiochem EMD Biosciences, Inc. In all experiments appropriate secondary antibodies from GE Healthcare Ltd. (Buckinhamshire, UK) were used. Western blots were developed according to the ECL detection system protocol from Pierce. Densitometry was performed on HyBlotCL autoradiography films (Denville Scientific, Inc., Metuchen, NJ) using the LabWorks 4.0 program on a UVP BioImaging system (UVP Inc., Upland, CA). Detection of Sup35NM-GFP Aggregation in the Yeast Cells— GFP detection in live yeast cells was performed as described previously (33Chernoff Y.O. Uptain S.M. Lindquist S.L. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 499-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 45Ganusova E.E. Ozolins L.N. Bhagat S. Newnam G.P. Wegrzyn R.D. Sherman M.Y. Chernoff Y.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 617-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures containing the plasmid pmCUPNMsGFP were pregrown in selective medium lacking uracil for a period of 2 days and then inoculated into the same medium with 50 or 100 μm CuSO4, to induce the PCUP1 promoter (the starting concentration of cells was 2–3 × 106 cells/ml). After the specified periods of time, aliquots were taken, and proportions of transformed cells containing detectable aggregated structures were determined by using the microscope BX41 (Olympus) with the Endow GFP Bandpass Emission filter. Cultures containing the pmCUPsGFP construct that was used as a control never produced cytologically detectable aggregates in these conditions (data not shown), confirming that aggregation is specific to the Sup35-GFP fused protein.

Ono B. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Science. 1995; 268: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To check whether or not alterations of the UPS affect [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104, we have constructed an isogenic series of yeast strains with deletions of the UBC4, UBC5, or UBP6 gene in the background of [PSI+] strain GT81-1C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” All deletion strains remained [PSI+], and neither deletion affected mitotic stability of [PSI+] under normal conditions (data not shown). Deletion strains and wild-type control strain were transformed with the plasmids producing Hsp104 from either the galactose-inducible (PGAL) or a strong constitutive (PGPD) promoter, as well as by empty control vectors. In the case of ubc4Δ, we also moderately overexpressed HSP104 by providing a single plasmid-borne copy under the control of its endogenous promoter. Levels of overexpressed Hsp104 were similar in wild-type and UPS mutants as confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The efficiency of [PSI+] curing in the presence of either PGAL-HSP104 (Fig. 1A) or PGPD-HSP104 (data not shown) constructs was detected by color on YPD medium and growth on -Ade medium. Efficiency of curing was decreased in ubc4Δ and ubp6Δ single deletion strains, compared with the wild-type strain. [PSI+] loss in the presence of an extra copy of PHSP104-HSP104 was also decreased in ubc4Δ (data not shown). Quantitative assays employing the PGAL-HSP104 construct demonstrated that the effect of double ubc4Δ ubp6Δ deletion on [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 is the same as the effect of single ubc4Δ deletion (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that both proteins influence [PSI+] curing via one and the same pathway and that Ubc4 acts before Ubp6. Such a conclusion is in agreement with the known roles of both enzymes in the Ub-proteasome degradation pathway. Interestingly, the efficiency of [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 was not altered in the ubc5Δ strain (data not shown), despite the fact that Ubc5 is known to have a role that is very similar to and partly redundant with that of Ubc4. A double ubc4Δ ubc5Δ deletion strain was not viable in the genetic background of our strains. The only other known mutation decreasing [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 is the double deletion of the genes SSB1 and SSB2, coding for the Ssb protein of the Hsp70 family (26Chernoff Y.O. Newnam G.P. Kumar J. Allen K. Zink A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8103-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This deletion is designated below as ssb1/2Δ. To check if ssb1/2Δ and deficiencies in the UPS components influence [PSI+] loss through one and the same pathway, we compared [PSI+] curing by excess of Hsp104 in several strains: the single ubc4Δ deletion strain, the double ssb1/2Δ strain, and the triple ubc4Δ ssb1/2Δ deletion strain. The triple ubc4Δ ssb1/2Δ deletion decreased the efficiency of [PSI+] curing in comparison to both single ubc4Δ or double ssb1/2Δ deletions (Fig. 1C). The additive effect of ubc4Δ and ssb1/2Δ indicates that these mutations influence [PSI+] curing by excess Hsp104 via different pathways. Spontaneous Formation of [PSI+] Is Increased in the ubc4Δ Background—Next, we checked whether spontaneous [PSI+] formation is influenced by the UPS alterations. In the [psi-] strain bearing the ade1–14 reporter allele, spontaneous [PSI+] formation can be detected as the emergence of small Ade+ revertants (papillae) on a patched colony growing on -Ade medium.

ARC (Apoptosis Repressor with Caspase recruitment domain) is an anti-apoptotic protein that is found abundantly in terminally differentiated cells such as cardiomyocytes. The ARC knock-out mouse developed larger infarct in response to ischemia-reperfusion and transitioned more rapidly and severely to dilated cardiomyopathy following aortic constriction. In addition, ARC protein levels are decreased in human dilated cardiomyopathy and when cardiomyocytes are exposed to oxidative stress in vitro, but the mechanisms regulating ARC protein levels are not known. Here we show that degradation of ARC is dependent on the p53-induced ubiquitin E3 ligase, MDM2. Oxidative stress reduced ARC levels and up-regulated MDM2. MDM2 directly accelerated ARC protein turnover via ubiquitination and proteasomal-dependent degradation. This activity requires a functioning MDM2 ring finger domain because the MDM2C464A mutant was unable to direct ARC degradation. Furthermore, ARC degradation requires MDM2, because MDM2 knock-out fibroblasts showed defective ARC degradation that could be rescued by MDM2. Proteasomal inhibitors rescued both MDM2 and H2O2-induced degradation of ARC and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Dilated cardiomyopathic hearts from mice that have undergone transverse aortic banding have increased MDM2 levels associated with decreased ARC levels. We conclude that MDM2 is a critical regulator of ARC levels in cardiomyocytes.

Cardiac myocyte apoptosis, implicated in ischemia-reperfusion injury and chronic heart failure (1Foo R.S. Mani K. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), plays a central role in the pathogenesis of cardiac diseases. A causal role in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure has been demonstrated by several different genetic mouse models. For example, cardiac-restricted expression of a procaspase-8 fusion protein (2Wencker D. Chandra M. Nguyen K. Miao W. Garantziotis S. Factor S.M. Shirani J. Armstrong R.C. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) produced very low but significantly raised levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.023 versus 0.002% in controls) and resulted in a lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. Conversely, systemic administration of broad spectrum caspase inhibitors starting before cardiac decompensation rescued apoptosis, abrogated cardiac dilatation, and significantly ameliorated contractile dysfunction (2Wencker D. Chandra M. Nguyen K. Miao W. Garantziotis S. Factor S.M. Shirani J. Armstrong R.C. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Notably, even though the level of apoptosis in this mouse was 5–10 times lower than found in human hearts with end stage dilated cardiomyopathy, this was sufficient alone to produce the cardiomyopathic phenotype (1Foo R.S. Mani K. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence also supports a critical role for reactive oxygen species in mediating pro-apoptotic signals in cardiomyocytes that result in chamber dilatation and pump dysfunction, for example following transverse aortic constriction (3Sorescu D.

In cardiomyocytes, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is a ubiquitous flavoprotein localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, provides protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress.

ARC has been reported (a) to interact with caspase-8, Fas, and FADD and to inhibit apoptosis induced by caspase-8 and receptor-induced apoptosis by Fas and TNF-R1, and (b) to interact with Bax and to inhibit Bax activation and apoptosis involving the mitochondrial pathway (8Nam Y.J.

ARC overexpression inhibited oxidant stress-induced cell death in H9c2 cells by preserving mitochondrial function (10Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and protected against ischaemia-reperfusion injury, where perfusion of TAT-ARC into isolated rat hearts reduced both creatine kinase release and infarct size (11Gustafsson A.B. Sayen M.R. Williams S.D. Crow M.T. Gottlieb R.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). More recently, ARC-deficient mice were found to develop both worsened progression to dilated cardiomyopathy following aortic banding and larger infarcts following ischemia-reperfusion compared with wild-type controls (12Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T. Bader M. Martin U. Bauersachs J. Wollert K.C. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Indeed, tissue from human dilated cardiomyopathic hearts showed decreased levels of ARC compared with normal control hearts. Notably, this difference was demonstrated by Western blot, but not by Northern blot, indicating that the reduction of ARC in cardiac dilatation is most likely to be regulated post-transcriptionally (12Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T. Bader M. Martin U. Bauersachs J. Wollert K.C. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although ARC protein levels crucially determine cardiomyocyte apoptosis, the mechanisms regulating ARC protein levels are not known. Here, we identify that the p53-induced ubiquitin E3 ligase, mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), is responsible for inducing ARC proteasomal-dependent degradation by ubiquitination. ARC protein level is reduced in cardiomyocytes exposed to oxidative stress, while MDM2 is concurrently up-regulated. ARC degradation requires MDM2 and its ring finger domain. The proteasomal inhibitors lactacystin and MG132 significantly inhibited ARC degradation induced by MDM2 or oxidative stress and inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Dilated cardiomyopathic hearts from mice that have undergone transverse aortic banding have increased MDM2 levels associated with decreased ARC levels. Cell Culture, Expression Plasmids, Transient Transfection, and Cell Treatment—H9c2 rat embryonic cardiac cells, NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 60–80% confluency. MDM2/p53 double knock-out MEFs were obtained from Dr. G. Lozano (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Wild-type MEFs were MDM2+/+/p53+/+. The human MDM2 expression plasmid was obtained from Dr. M. Oren (Weizmann Institute of Science), and site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was performed to obtain the MDM2C464A mutant plasmid using the following primer pair, 5′-GGCCTGCTTTACAGCTGCAAGAAGCTAAAGAAAAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCTTTGCAGCTGTAAAGCAGGCCATAAGATGTCC-3′. SIAH1 cDNA was cloned onto the pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid (Invitrogen) from a mouse cardiac cDNA preparation. All sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. The ARC expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1/ARC-HA) is as previously described (8Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using Effectene (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To induce oxidative stress, cells were incubated with 400 μm H2O2 for the indicated time points. Cells were additionally preincubated with lactacystin for 1 h prior to H2O2 or incubated with lactacystin 18 h after transient transfection followed by a further 18-h incubation. Death Assays—For measuring apoptotic index, cells were incubated with the nuclear dyes Hoescht (H22358) and propidium iodide for 15 min, and photomicrographs were taken using fluorescence microscopy. H22358 stains all nuclei, whereas propidium iodide stains only dead/apoptotic nuclei. Apoptotic index was quantified by the ratio of condensed nuclei/total nuclei in at least 10 fields where each field contained at least 50 nuclei. Results were obtained from three independent experiments and shown as mean ± S.D. To demonstrate DNA laddering, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS) and DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel. Western Blotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Cycloheximide Chase—Cells were scraped into a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40) and protein concentration determined using the Bradford method. Equal protein amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies as follows: ARC (Cayman), p53 (1C12; Cell Signaling), phosphor-p53(Ser-20) polyclonal (Cell Signaling), MDM2 (Calbiochem), SIAH1 (Santa Cruz), β-actin (Abcam), and ubiquitin (Abcam). Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson Laboratories) were used. For immunoprecipitation of ARC complexes, cells were incubated with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (10 μm) 18 h after transfection and incubated for a further 18 h before being scraped into lysis buffer. Protein concentration was determined, and 500 μg of total protein lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) and 8 μg of ARC antibody (Cayman). Protein A beads were prewashed twice with lysis buffer. Following incubation, beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Cycloheximide chase was performed by incubating cells with 50 ng/ml cycloheximide for the indicated time points, following which lysates were immediately collected into lysis buffer. Transverse Aortic Banding—Transverse aortic banding was performed on 3–4-month-old FVB/N mice as previously described (13Tachibana H. Naga Prasad S.V. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Rockman H.A. Circulation. 2005; 111: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) according to protocols approved by the Institute for Animal Studies of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Left ventricular (LV) dilatation was confirmed by echocardiography and LV weight/body weight measurements 12 weeks following transverse aortic banding (2Wencker D. Chandra M. Nguyen K. Miao W. Garantziotis S. Factor S.M. Shirani J. Armstrong R.C. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). H2O2 Induces Apoptotic Cell Death in H9c2 with Concurrent Decrease of ARC and Up-regulation of MDM2—Previous studies have shown that oxidative stress induced by H2O2 decreased endogenous ARC levels in rat embryonic cardiac H9c2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (10Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found similarly that H2O2 induced significant apoptotic (50–60%) cell death in H9c2 cells (Figs. 1 and 8) and this was associated with a time-dependent decrease in ARC protein levels (Fig. 1C). Condensed nuclear morphology of apoptotic cells from H2O2 treatment is shown in Fig. 1A, and DNA laddering in similarly treated cells is shown in Fig. 1B. In myocytes, H2O2-induced apoptosis is mediated by the pro-apoptotic transcription factor p53 (14Long X. Boluyt M.O. Hipolito M.L. Lundberg M.S. Zheng J.S. O'Neill L. Cirielli C. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 2635-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and in this pathway, activated p53 can be stabilized via a variety of post-transcriptional means, including phosphorylation (15Vousden K.H. Prives C. Cell. 2005; 120: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We found that ARC decrease coincided with p53 phosphorylation, as represented by the appearance of a slower running band when lysates were immunoblotted for total p53 (Fig. 1C). Blotting with a phosphor-specific antibody showed that at least serine 20 phosphorylation is increased (Fig. 1C), but not phosphorylation of serine 15 (data not shown).FIGURE 8Decreased levels of ARC in dilated cardiomyopathic mouse hearts are associated with up-regulated levels of MDM2. Protein lysates were prepared from left ventricular tissue of sham-operated hearts and transaortic-banded dilated hearts and were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ARC and anti-MDM2 antibodies. Asterisk (*) represents a nonspecific band that allows comparison of protein loading from lane to lane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the decrease of ARC in cardiac disease appears to be post-transcriptionally controlled (12Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T. Bader M. Martin U. Bauersachs J. Wollert K.C. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we examined whether a target gene of the transcriptional factor p53 may be responsible for increased ARC protein degradation. We found that ARC decrease and p53 phosphorylation coincided with an up-regulation of the MDM2 (Fig. 1C). MDM2 Degrades ARC Protein Directly—MDM2 is a RING finger domain protein with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. In the ubiquitin proteolysis system, the ubiquitin target protein complex is formed in three sequential steps (16Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar) that comprise the ubiquitin activating enzyme E1, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and the ubiquitin ligase, E3. E1 is a common enzyme involved in ubiquitination of all proteins, but the specificity for the protein that is ubiquitinated is usually dependent on the E3 ligase in the reaction. Further polyubiquitination of the targeted protein often involves other multiprotein complexes, but degradation of the resultant polyubiquitinated protein takes place at the proteasomal complex. Because we found that the E3 ligase MDM2 is up-regulated concurrently with ARC decrease, we determined whether ARC protein can be directly reduced by MDM2. Overexpression of MDM2 itself led to a decrease in ARC levels (Fig. 2). In contrast, overexpression of another E3 ligase that is also a gene target of p53, SIAH 1 (17Liani E. Eyal A. Avraham E. Shemer R. Szargel R. Berg D. Bornemann A. Riess O. Ross C.A. Rott R. Engelender S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5500-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 18Matsuzawa S. Takayama S. Froesch B.A. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), does not down-regulate ARC. We further determined the effect of MDM2 on ARC protein turnover by performing cycloheximide chase. As shown in Fig. 3, turnover of endogenous ARC protein was accelerated in MDM2-transfected H9c2 compared with vector control-transfected cells, indicating that MDM2 is able to increase ARC degradation.FIGURE 3MDM2 up-regulates protein turnover of ARC. H9c2 cells were transfected with either vector control (pcDNA) or a vector expressing MDM2. Twelve hours following transfection, cyclohexamide chase was performed by incubating cells with cyclohexamide and harvested after the indicated times. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-ARC polyclonal antibody. Western blot was quantified and densitometry was normalized to β-actin for each time point and expressed as a percentage of the densitometry at time 0 h. Results represent average ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MDM2 Promotes Ubiquitination of ARC in Vivo, and a Functional MDM2 Ring Finger Domain Is Required for ARC Degradation—Because MDM2 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase and it is able to directly induce ARC degradation, we tested the possibility that MDM2 facilitates ARC ubiquitination. ARC-deficient NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were transfected with ARC, with or without MDM2, and polyubiquitinated bands were detected in immunoprecipitated ARC complexes in the presence of MDM2 transfection but not in the presence of vector control transfection (Fig. 4). The MDM2 ring finger domain is responsible for its ubiquitin E3 ligase property, and a C464A mutation is known to disrupt the MDM2 ring finger domain function (19Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar). Expression of mutant MDM2C464A did not induce ARC degradation, indicating that an intact ring finger domain is necessary for MDM2-induced ARC degradation (Fig. 5). This is despite MDM2 accumulation as a result of the ring finger mutation as MDM2 serves to autoubiquitinate and promote its own degradation (20Fang S. Jensen J.P. Ludwig R.L. Vousden K.H. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Degradation of ARC requires a functioning MDM2 ring finger domain, and MDM2-induced ARC degradation is inhibited by lactacystin. H9c2 cells were transfected, as in Fig. 2, with either vector control (pcDNA) or vectors transducing the expression of MDM2 or MDM2C464A (MDM2 ring finger mutant). Additionally, lane 4 represents cells that were transfected with MDM2 plasmid and incubated with lactacystin for a further 18 h following transfection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MDM2 Is Required for ARC Degradation—To examine whether MDM2 is both necessary and sufficient for ARC degradation, we examined ARC protein turnover in cells lacking MDM2. The MDM2 knock-out mouse is embryonic lethal, and MDM2-/- MEFs do not exist (21Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1190) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed ARC in MDM2/p53 double knock-out or wild-type (MDM2+/+/p53+/+) MEFs and incubated cells with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide. ARC levels were decreased with cycloheximide in wild-type MEFs but maintained in double knock-out MEFs. Re-introduction of MDM2 to double knock-out MEFs by transient transfection restored ARC protein turnover (Fig. 6). Proteasomal Inhibitors Rescue Both MDM2-induced and H2O2-induced ARC Degradation and Inhibit H2O2-induced Cardiomyocyte Apoptosis—Because most polyubiquitinated proteins are targeted for degradation at the proteasomal complex, we examined the effect of the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin on ARC levels. Lactacystin rescued MDM2-induced (Fig. 5, lane 4) and H2O2-induced ARC degradation (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, lactacystin inhibited H2O2-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis as measured by apoptotic index (Fig. 7B). Similar results were found for another proteasomal inhibitor, MG132 (not shown). Increased MDM2 Expression Is Associated with Decreased ARC Protein Levels in Dilated Cardiomyopathic Mouse Hearts—Mechanical load is known to activate signaling cascades, including oxidative stress, which in turn predisposes to cardiomyocyte apoptosis (22Frey N. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar), and the latter is seen during the transition from hypertrophy to dilated cardiomyopathy (23Sarkar S. Chawla-Sarkar M. Young D. Nishiyama K. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Sen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52630-52642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In wild-type mice 12 weeks after transverse aortic banding we found a ∼1.8-fold decrease in ARC levels on Western blot compared with sham-operated mice, and this decrease in ARC protein levels was associated with a marked increase in MDM2 expression (Fig. 8). We demonstrate that the ubiquitin E3 ligase MDM2 is a critical regulator of ARC protein level. Oxidative stress induced by H2O2 resulted in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and degradation of ARC. Concurrently, p53 is activated and MDM2 levels are increased. Interestingly, in this in vitro model of H2O2-induced H9c2 apoptosis increased phosphorylation of p53-Ser-20 but not p53-Ser-15 is observed. It has been previously shown that Chk2 can phosphorylate Ser-20 (24Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar) and that phosphorylation at this site enhances p53 stability and activity. In fact, phosphorylation of Ser-20 inhibits MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 (25Chehab N.H. Malikzay A. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Jardine L.J. Meek D.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we have found that up-regulated MDM2 is able to directly induce ARC decrease mediated at least in part through increased ARC protein turnover. Whether MDM2 also induces decrease in transcription or translation of ARC is not yet known, but the former remains possible because MDM2 is also able to induce degradation of p53 (29Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 30Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar) and as a transcription factor p53 may be involved in positive feedback to up-regulate ARC transcription. MDM2 induces ubiquitination of ARC, and MDM2-induced degradation of ARC requires a functional MDM2 ring finger domain, indicating that the E3 ligase activity is required for ARC degradation. MDM2 is both necessary and sufficient for ARC protein degradation, because ARC protein levels do not change in MDM2/p53 double knock-out MEFs and re-introduction of MDM2 in MDM2/p53 double knock-out MEFs restores ARC protein degradation. The relationship between MDM2 and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was also recently investigated by Toth et al. (31Toth A. Nickson P. Qin L.L. Erhardt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3679-3689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These workers showed that cardiomyocytes overexpressing MDM2 acquired resistance to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cell death, whereas with a specific MDM2 peptide inhibitor (PNC-28) that disrupts the p53-MDM2 interface H/R resulted in higher p53 levels and promoted apoptosis. Although this report from Toth et al. appears to contradict our current findings, we have in fact shown here that this system is perhaps more complex. Like Toth et al., we found that oxidative stress induces cardiomyocyte death accompanied by p53 activation. Because MDM2 is a critical regulator of p53 and is responsible for ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (29Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 30Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar), Toth et al. found that MDM2 overexpression results in p53 down-regulation and cardioprotection. We report here that in addition to down-regulating the pro-apoptotic protein p53, MDM2 also down-regulates the anti-apoptotic protein ARC. Because p53 signals are proximal to the protective mechanisms of ARC (10Neuss M. Monticone R. Lundberg M.S. Chesley A.T. Fleck E. Crow M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33915-33922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), overexpression of MDM2 would be expected to confer protection via degradation of p53 even if simultaneously ARC is degraded by MDM2. Interestingly, the MDM2 peptide inhibitor (PNC-28) used by Toth et al., which disrupts the p53/MDM2 interface so that p53 accumulates and is rendered untargeted by MDM2, does not inhibit MDM2-induced ARC degradation (not shown). The latter suggests that the ARC/MDM2 interface is distinct from the p53/MDM2 interface and that ARC degradation despite PNC-28 could contribute in part to the increased cell death that is observed with PNC-28 treatment. Toth et al. also used a recently generated mouse model with 70% knock down of MDM2 and found that these mice responded more severely to ischemia-reperfusion. It is unknown if ARC levels are sustained at this level of MDM2 knock down, but it would appear that at this level, p53 prodeath signals exceed the protection provided by ARC. In conclusion, MDM2-mediated degradation of ARC is a potential therapeutic target to prevent apoptosis in cardiac disease. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis occurs in human cardiomyopathy, and in the mouse myocyte apoptosis can directly cause cardiac dilatation. An anti-apoptotic protein such as ARC that is only abundantly expressed in the heart has been proposed as a suitable target for cardiac-specific therapy (1Foo R.S. Mani K. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 32von Harsdorf R. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that inhibition of the proteasomal complex in vitro is able to maintain ARC levels and inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis, it remains to be seen whether this result will translate to physiological benefits such as smaller infarcts following ischemia-reperfusion or retarded progression to dilated cardiomyopathy in vivo. Interestingly, 12-week systemic administration of proteasomal inhibitors to spontaneously hypertensive rats successfully suppressed myocardial expression of matrix metalloproteinases and collagens and significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis (33Meiners S. Hocher B. Weller A. Laule M. Stangl V. Guenther C. Godes M. Mrozikiewicz A. Baumann G. Stangl K. Hypertension. 2004; 44: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In that study no change in heart weight/body weight ratio was detected, but cardiac chamber dimensions were not measured. Indeed, a concurrent benefit from inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis in this or another cardiomyopathic model would be worth investigating. Longer term treatment to inhibit ARC degradation may require more ARC-specific inhibitors of degradation. Furthermore, our observations with the MDM2 inhibitor (PNC-28) that specifically targets the p53/MDM2 interface, but apparently not the ARC/MDM2 interface, suggest that further investigation to map the domains on ARC and MDM2 that are required for MDM2-mediated ARC degradation may help to identify additional small peptide MDM2 inhibitors. Indeed, there may be an opportunity to use such a peptide inhibitor to switch the regulatory control of apoptosis so that MDM2 predominantly degrades p53 (pro-apoptotic), but not ARC (anti-apoptotic), in a situation such as cardiac disease where down-regulation of myocyte apoptosis is the objective."
https://openalex.org/W2026541112,"Recent data have suggested that regular consumption of nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events. It has been suggested that this is due to NSAIDs reducing the release from the endothelium of the antithrombotic mediator prostaglandin I2 as a result of inhibition of endothelial COX-2. Here, however, we show that despite normal human vessels and endothelial cells containing cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) without any detectable COX-2, COX-1 in vessels or endothelial cells is more readily inhibited by NSAIDs and COX-2-selective drugs than COX-1 in platelets (e.g., log IC50+/-SEM values for endothelial cells vs. platelets: naproxen -5.59+/-0.07 vs. -4.81+/-0.04; rofecoxib -4.93+/-0.04 vs. -3.75+/-0.03; n=7). In broken cell preparations, the selectivities of the tested drugs toward endothelial cell over platelet COX-1 were lost. These observations suggest that variations in cellular conditions, such as endogenous peroxide tone and substrate supply, and not the isoform of cyclo-oxygenase present, dictate the effects of NSAIDs on endothelial cells vs. platelets. This may well be because the platelet is not a good representative of COX-1 activity within the body as it produces prostanoids in an explosive burst that does not reflect tonic release from other cells. The results reported here can offer an explanation for the apparent ability of NSAIDs and COX-2-selective inhibitors to increase the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2032334145,"Peptides derived from protein kinase C (PKC) modulate its activity by interfering with critical protein-protein interactions within PKC and between PKC and PKC-binding proteins (Souroujon, M. C., and Mochly-Rosen, D. (1998) Nat. Biotechnol. 16, 919-924). We previously demonstrated that the C2 domain of PKC plays a critical role in these interactions. By focusing on ϵPKC and using a rational approach, we then identified one C2-derived peptide that acts as an isozyme-selective activator and another that acts as a selective inhibitor of ϵPKC. These peptides were used to identify the role of ϵPKC in protection from cardiac and brain ischemic damage, in prevention of complications from diabetes, in reducing pain, and in protecting transplanted hearts. The efficacy of these two peptides led us to search for additional C2-derived peptides with PKC-modulating activities. Here we report on the activity of a series of 5-9-residue peptides that are derived from regions that span the length of the C2 domain of ϵPKC. These peptides were tested for their effect on PKC activity in cells in vivo and in an ex vivo model of acute ischemic heart disease. Most of the peptides acted as activators of PKC, and a few peptides acted as inhibitors. PKC-dependent myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate phosphorylation in ϵPKC knock-out cells revealed that only a subset of the peptides were selective for ϵPKC over other PKC isozymes. These ϵPKC-selective peptides were also protective of the myocardium from ischemic injury, an ϵPKC-dependent function (Liu, G. S., Cohen, M. V., Mochly-Rosen, D., and Downey, J. M. (1999) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 31, 1937-1948), and caused selective translocation of ϵPKC over other isozymes when injected systemically into mice. Examination of the structure of the C2 domain from ϵPKC revealed that peptides with similar activities clustered into discrete regions within the domain. We propose that these regions represent surfaces of protein-protein interactions within ϵPKC and/or between ϵPKC and other partner proteins; some of these interactions are unique to ϵPKC, and others are common to other PKC isozymes.

PKC activation is associated with binding to the negatively charged phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, and different PKC isozymes have varying sensitivities to Ca2+ and lipid-derived second messengers such as diacylglycerol (15Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Upon activation, PKC isozymes translocate from the soluble to the particulate cell fraction (16Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), including cell membrane, nucleus (17Disatnik M.H. Buraggi G. Mochly-Rosen D. Exp.

Res. 2005; 97: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). PKC primary sequence can be broadly separated into two domains as follows: the N-terminal regulatory domain and the conserved C-terminal catalytic domain. The regulatory domain of PKC is composed of the C1 and C2 domains that mediate PKC interactions with second messengers, phospholipids, as well as inter- and intramolecular protein-protein interactions. (The C2 domain in one subfamily of PKC isozymes was termed V1 until the homology to the C2 domain was identified (19Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).) Differences in the order and number of copies of signaling domains, as well as sequence differences that affect binding affinities, result in the distinct activity of each PKC isozyme (15Newton A.C.

For ϵPKC, the following two peptides were identified rationally: ϵV1-2, an ϵPKC inhibitor derived from a sequence from the C2 region that binds to the anchoring protein ϵRACK (β′COP) (22Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24962-24966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and ψϵRACK, an ϵPKC allosteric activator derived from a sequence implicated in autoinhibitory interactions (12Dorn II, G.W.

Both peptides represent regions in ϵC2 that were well conserved in evolution and are different enough from the sequences in other PKC isozymes. (For example, ϵV1-2 is 88% identical between Aplysia and rat ϵPKC, whereas it is only 36% identical between rat ϵPKC and rat δPKC.) Furthermore, the ψϵRACK peptide, derived from ϵC2, is also homologous to a sequence within its cognate receptor, ϵRACK (12Dorn II, G.W. Souroujon M.C. Liron T. Chen C.H. Gray M.O. Zhou H.Z. Csukai M.

Open table in a new tab Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized and conjugated to TAT carrier peptide (residues 47-57) via cysteine S-S bond by Anaspec, San Jose, CA. Peptides are 5-8 residues and represent sequences in the C2/V1 domain of ϵPKC. Three control peptides have also been synthesized as follows: scrambled ϵV1-2, scrambled ψϵRACK, and TAT carrier peptide alone. See Table 1 for a summary of peptides synthesized, including sequences. PKC Translocation in Cells—ϵPKC translocation from the soluble to the particulate fraction in CHO cells was used to assess the relative amount of activated (membrane-bound) ϵPKC, an assay that has been described previously (42Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Evidence of translocation is either by an increase in the amount of PKC in the particulate fraction or by a decrease in the soluble fraction. Briefly, after stimulation, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in homogenization buffer, passed through a syringe needle (25-gauge 5/8-inch), and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in homogenization buffer with 1% Triton X-100. Where applicable, the cells were preincubated with 500 nm peptide for 15 min prior to stimulation. PKC was stimulated with submaximal levels of the general PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 3 nm). The samples were then analyzed by Western blot. Antibodies against ϵPKC were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used at 1:500 dilution. Antibodies against actin, used as a loading control, were obtained from Sigma and used at 1:1000 dilution. PKC Substrate Phosphorylation in Cells—Phosphorylation of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), a general PKC substrate, was monitored by Western blot of cell lysates. To assess PKC activation by the peptides and their specificity for ϵPKC, MARCKS phosphorylation in wild-type primary skeletal muscle cells was compared with MARCKS phosphorylation in primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from ϵPKC knock-out mice (45Khasar S.G. Lin Y.H. Martin A. Dadgar J. McMahon T. Wang D. Hundle B. Aley K.O. Isenberg W. McCarter G. Green P.G. Hodge C.W. Levine J.D. Messing R.O.

For the ϵPKC inhibition assay, WT cells were treated with 1 μm peptide 7 for 15 min, and ψϵRACK (500 nm) was then added for 30 min prior to cell lysis. Antibodies against phosphorylated MARCKS were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) and used at a 1:500 dilution. Antibodies against actin, used as a loading control, were obtained from Sigma and used at 1:1000 dilution. Ex Vivo Cardiac Protection—Activation of ϵPKC prior to ischemia mediates cardiac protection in an ex vivo model of acute ischemic heart damage (2Liu G.S. Cohen M.V. Mochly-Rosen D. Downey J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1937-1948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), an assay that has been described previously (47Hondeghem L.M. Cotner C.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: H574-H580PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Wistar rats (300-350 g) were heparinized (1000 units/kg intraperitoneally) and then anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Hearts were rapidly excised and then perfused with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing NaCl (120 mmol/liter), KCl (5.8 mmol/liter), NaHCO3 (25 mmol/liter), NaH2PO4 (1.2 mmol/liter), MgSO4 (1.2 mmol/liter), CaCl2 (1.0 mmol/liter), and dextrose (10 mmol/liter) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C in a Langendorff coronary perfusion system. A constant coronary flow rate of 10 ml/min was used. Hearts were submerged into a heat-jacketed organ bath at 37 °C. Coronary effluent was collected to determine creatine phosphokinase release. After 10 min of equilibration, the hearts were subjected to 40 min of global ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. The hearts were perfused with 1 μm TAT-conjugated peptide for 10 min prior to ischemia. In addition to the relative amount of creatine phosphokinase released, a measure of cardiac myocyte lysis, tissue damage was assessed by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining of heart crosssections to quantitate the amount of infarcted (dead) tissue, as we described previously (36Inagaki K. Hahn H.S. Dorn II, G.W. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Isozyme Selectivity in Vivo—To determine that activator peptides causing MARCKS phosphorylation and decreasing ischemia-reperfusion damage in heart also induce ϵPKC translocation in vivo, we injected the respective peptides at 20 nmol in 200 μl of saline into the peritoneum of 15-20 g mice, as reported previously (48Begley R. Liron T. Baryza J. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fifteen minutes later, the mice were sacrificed, and heart and brain were collected. Soluble and particulate fractions from mouse tissue were prepared as described previously (48Begley R. Liron T. Baryza J. Mochly-Rosen D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 949-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). α-, ϵ-, ζ-, and δPKC translocations were determined by Western blot analysis using selective anti-PKC antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a 1:500 dilution. Sarcomeric actin (1:1000, Sigma) was used as a loading control for all fractions. We synthesized 13 new 5-9-residue peptides derived from sequences that span the C2 domain (also known as the V1 domain (19Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 207-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) of ϵPKC and tested them for their effect on PKC activation. Fig. 1 shows the β-sandwich revealed in the x-ray crystal structure of the domain (49Ochoa W.F. Garcia-Garcia J. Fita I. Corbalan-Garcia S. Verdaguer N. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), with peptide regions colored in ROYGBV order by primary sequence, to ease their identification. In Fig. 1, gray represents regions from which peptides were not analyzed. Residues in the top loop region that are not resolved in the crystal structure appear as a gap in connectivity. Three peptides were synthesized as controls as follows: scrambled versions of a previously established peptide activator (ψϵRACK) and inhibitor (ϵV1-2), and the TAT carrier peptide alone. Table 1 lists all the peptides tested in this study. We hypothesized that peptides that represent regions involved in intramolecular interactions with an inhibitory domain or in intermolecular interactions with an inhibitory protein will act as agonists of ϵPKC as they will disrupt these inhibitory interactions. We also hypothesized that peptides that correspond to the binding sites for activating proteins such as ϵRACK will act as antagonists. Finally, we predicted that peptides corresponding to unique interactions for ϵPKC will show isozyme selectivity, whereas other peptides represent regions of intra- or intermolecular interactions that are common for more than one PKC isozyme and therefore will affect many PKC isozymes. Four assays were used to investigate the effect of the TAT-conjugated peptides on ϵPKC as follows: ϵPKC translocation in cultured cells (16Kraft A.S. Anderson W.B. Cooper H.L. Sando J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13193-13196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phosphorylation of PKC substrate MARCKS in cultured cells (39Disatnik M.H. Boutet S.C. Lee C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Rando T.A.

https://openalex.org/W1986042961,"Caloric restriction (CR) delays the onset of age-related mitochondrial abnormalities but does not prevent the decline in ATP production needed to sustain muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) and contractile activity. We hypothesized that improving mitochondrial activity and FSR using a CR diet with maintained protein intakes could enhance myofibrillar protein FSR and consequently improve muscle strength in aging rats. Wistar rats (21 months old) were fed either an ad libitum (AL), 40% protein-energy restricted (PER) or 40% AL-isonitrogenous energy restricted (ER) diet for 5 months. ATP production, electron transport chain activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, protein carbonyl content and FSR were determined in both tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus muscle mitochondria. Myosin and actin FSR and grip force were also investigated. The ER diet led to improved mitochondrial activity and ATP production in the TA and soleus muscles in comparison with PER. Furthermore, mitochondrial FSR in the TA was enhanced under the ER diet but diminished under the PER. Mitochondrial protein carbonyl content was decreased by both the ER and PER diets. The ER diet was able to improve myosin and actin FSR and grip force. Therefore, the synergistic effects of CR with maintained protein intake may help to limit the progression of sarcopenia by optimizing the turnover rates and functions of major proteins in skeletal muscle."

However, little is known about the regulation of these receptors.

CD33-related Siglecs (Siglecs 5–11) are characterized by an N-terminal V-set Ig domain that mediates sialic acid binding and varying numbers of C2-set Ig domains. Sialic acids are a family of 9-carbon sugars that are derivatives of neuraminic acid or ketodeoxynonulosonic acid. The CD33-related Siglecs contain an ITIM and an ITSM in their cytoplasmic tails (1Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunology. 2001; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The ITIM consists of a tyrosine with a leucine or valine at the +3 position and a hydrophobic base at the –2 position ((I/L/V)XYXX(L/V)), where X denotes any amino acid. The ITIM tyrosine is phosphorylated by Src family protein tyrosine kinases followed by recruitment of SH2-containing phosphatases such as the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, SHIP, and protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 to inhibit signaling (2Billadeau D.D.

The SH2 domain of SOCS3 displays 39 and 41% homology with the N-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2, respectively. SOCS3 bound to the same ITIM-like sites as SHP-1/2 on gp130, LRb, and EpoR, indicating that SHP-1/2 and SOCS3 share a similar ligand binding specificity (11Hortner M. Nielsch U. Mayr L.M.

Fresh antibody was added at 24 h, and viable cells were measured by trypan blue exclusion and MTT assays (12Tannahill G.M. Elliott J. Barry A.C. Hibbert L. Cacalano N.A. Johnston J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9115-9126Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). SOCS3 Binds to the Phosphorylated ITIM of Siglec 7—Siglec 7 has been shown to recruit SHP-1/2 following pervanadate treatment (15Avril T. Floyd H. Lopez F. Vivier E. Crocker P.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6841-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cytokine receptors such as gp130 and the leptin and Epo receptors also recruit SHP-1/2 and SOCS3 to ITIM-like motifs, which contain a hydrophobic residue at position Y–2 and a valine or leucine residue at Y + 3 (11Hortner M. Nielsch U. Mayr L.M. Heinrich P.C. Haan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that SHP-1/2 and SOCS3 share a similar ligand binding specificity. Therefore, the SOCS3·GST fusion protein was used to examine any interaction with Siglec 7. 293T cells were transiently transfected with either 2 μg of empty vector (EV) or Siglec 7 pME18S-FLAG. Cell lysates were incubated with either GST or SOCS3·GST fusion protein bound to streptavidin beads for 4 h or immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG. Siglec 7 bound to the SOCS3·GST fusion protein (Fig. 1A, panel 1 (top), lane 4), whereas binding to the control GST fusion protein was undetectable (lane 2). The experiment consistently indicated an interaction between Siglec 7 and SOCS3. To map the location of this interaction, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Siglec 7 ITIM biotinylated peptides were used to pull down SOCS3. 293T cells were transiently transfected with EV or SOCS3 pME18S-FLAG, and lysates were incubated for 4 h with the peptides or immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG. SOCS3 associated with the phosphorylated ITIM peptide (Fig. 1B, panel 1, lane 5), whereas no association was observed with the unphosphorylated ITIM or the T cell receptor ITAM peptides (lanes 4 and 6). Endogenous SHP-2 also associated with the phosphorylated ITIM peptide (Fig. 1B, panel 3, lanes 2 and 5). The data indicated that SOCS3 bound to the Siglec 7 ITIM in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner. Cell Surface Cross-linking of Siglec 7 in the Presence and Absence of SOCS3—Cross-linking results in activation of Siglec 7 by recruiting SHP-1/2 (15Avril T. Floyd H. Lopez F. Vivier E. Crocker P.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6841-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Siglec 7WT and Siglec 7Y341F stable Ba/F3 cells (1 × 107 cells/point) were incubated with α-Siglec 7 (QA79) for 20 min ± GAM for 30 min to determine the importance of the ITIM tyrosine residue. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with α-FLAG. Cross-linking Siglec 7 resulted in a slight decrease in Siglec 7WT expression (Fig. 2A, panel 1, lane 4), whereas cross-linking did not affect Siglec 7Y341F expression (lane 8). Whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with α-STAT5B to confirm equal loading (Fig. 2A, panel 2). Degradation of Siglec 7Y341F was not observed, which indicated that the proximal tyrosine motif was important for the degradation of Siglec 7 in the absence of SOCS3. Loss of expression of Siglec 7 in lane 4 (Fig. 2A, panel 1) was consistent over three experiments; however, it was not statistically significant in the absence of SOCS3 according to the Students t test. SOCS proteins form E3 ligase complexes and can target a range of proteins such as the growth hormone receptor, JAK2, Vav, and IRS1/2 for proteasomal degradation (8Elliott J. Johnston J.A. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As we had demonstrated that SOCS3 bound to the phosphorylated ITIM of Siglec 7 (Fig. 1), it was important to investigate whether SOCS3 affected the expression levels of Siglec 7. Therefore, a cross-linking experiment was performed in Siglec 7WT Ba/F3 cells with SOCS3 under a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Siglec 7WT Ba/F3-SOCS3 cells (1 × 107 cells/point) were incubated with α-Siglec 7 (QA79) for 20 min ± GAM for 5–15 min. The cells were lysed and treated as described previously. Degradation of Siglec 7 and SOCS3 occurred in a time-dependent manner following cross-linking for 5, 10, and 15 min (Fig. 2B, panels 1 and 2, lanes 14–16, and supplemental Fig. 1), whereas in the absence of SOCS3 this degradation was not observed (Fig. 2B, panel 1, lanes 6–8). Therefore, we have demonstrated that 30 min of cross-linking resulted in a small decrease in Siglec 7 expression levels in the absence of SOCS3 (Fig. 2A, panel 1), whereas in the presence of SOCS3 cross-linking for 5 min was sufficient to initiate its degradation (Fig. 2B, panel 1) in correlation with the loss of SOCS3. The data imply that the Siglec 7 receptor is a novel target for SOCS3 and that both proteins are targeted for degradation together. This has not been reported previously for any SOCS target. To further investigate this regulatory mechanism, SOCS3–/– cells were used to determine whether this protein was required for degradation of Siglec 7 to occur. Siglec 7 stable SOCS3–/– and WT MEFs (2 × 106/point) were incubated with α-Siglec 7 (QA79) for 20 min (±GAM for 30 min). The cells were lysed and treated as described previously. Cross-linking Siglec 7 for 30 min resulted in significant degradation of Siglec 7 (p < 0.0005) and SOCS3 (Fig. 2C, panels 1 and 2, lane 8), whereas minimal degradation was observed in the absence of SOCS3 (Fig. 2C, panel 1, lane 4). These data indicate that SOCS3 greatly enhances and accelerates turnover of Siglec 7 and that SOCS3 is degraded concomitantly. Induction of SOCS3 by lipopolysaccharide in peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in the down-regulation of surface expression of endogenous Siglec 7 (supplemental Fig. 2), implying that SOCS3 enhances its internalization and degradation. SOCS proteins can act as E3 ligases by forming a complex with Elongin B/C and Cul5/Rbx1/2 (9Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 10Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). SOCS3 has previously been shown to target IRS1/2 to the proteasome for degradation (16Rui L. Yuan M. Frantz D. Shoelson S. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42394-42398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Siglec 7 was degraded via the 26 S proteasome, 293T cells were transiently transfected with EV and Siglec 7WT with the E3 ligase complex (Elongin B/C, Cul5, and Rbx1) ± SOCS3. The cells were treated ± proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and LLNL) for 30 min prior to incubation with α-Siglec 7 (QA79) for 20 min ± GAM for 15 min. The cells were lysed and treated as described previously. Cross-linking for 15 min in the presence of the E3 ligase complex and SOCS3 resulted in significant Siglec 7 degradation (Fig. 2D, panel 1, lane 9)(p < 0.005) when compared with the absence of SOCS3 (lane 5). SOCS3 degradation occurred in correlation with Siglec 7 following cross-linking for 15 min (Fig. 2D, panel 2, lane 9). This degradation was rescued by pretreatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 and LLNL (Fig. 2D, panel 1, lanes 14 and 18, and panel 2, lane 18). This suggests that after activation, SOCS3 may target Siglec 7 for proteasomal degradation. Degradation of Siglec 7 or SOCS3 was not observed when the E3 ligase complex was absent, indicating that this complex may be necessary for the degradation to occur in 293T cells (data not shown). SOCS3 Inhibits Siglec 7-mediated Responses on Cytokine-induced Proliferation—Cross-linking CD33 and Siglec 7 has previously been shown to inhibit proliferation of chronic and acute myeloid leukemias (7Vitale C. Romagnani C. Falco M. Ponte M. Vitale M. Moretta A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15091-15096Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Vitale C. Romagnani C. Puccetti A. Olive D. Costello R. Chiossone L. Pitto A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5764-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether engagement of Siglec 7 could inhibit proliferation of a cytokine-inducible cell line, and the effect of SOCS3 on this. Siglec 7WT stable Ba/F3-SOCS3 cells were seeded ± Tet at 1 × 105 cells/ml and cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum containing 5 units/ml of IL-3. Samples were cross-linked ± α-Siglec 7 (QA79) and GAM. F(ab′)2 was also used to ensure that the observed effect was not due to the Fc portion of the cross-linking antibody, and similar results were obtained for GAM and F(ab′)2 (data not shown). Samples were analyzed by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cross-linking Siglec 7 in Siglec 7WT (Fig. 3B) cells in the absence of SOCS3 exhibited significant inhibition of IL-3-induced proliferation as determined by the Students t test (p < 0.005) compared with cells treated with GAM after 48 h. In the presence of SOCS3 no significant effect was observed. These observations suggest that engagement of Siglec 7 in the absence of SOCS3 inhibited IL-3-induced proliferation, whereas the presence of SOCS3 blocked this effect. The MTT assay was used to determine the function of the ITIM tyrosine and to confirm the results from the trypan blue exclusion assay. When compared with Siglec 7WT (p < 0.0005), Siglec 7Y341F (Fig. 3C) cells showed a much less significant effect on cytokine-induced proliferation in the absence of SOCS3 (p < 0.05), whereas the presence of SOCS3 blocked this effect. These data indicate a role for the ITIM of Siglec 7 in the inhibition of IL-3-induced proliferation. Similar results were obtained in a more physiological manner using Epo-Siglec 7 chimeras stimulated with Epo (data not shown). Engagement of Siglec 7WT inhibited cytokine-induced proliferation, possibly via SHP-1/2, and SOCS3 may compete with SHP-1/2 for binding to Siglec 7 leading to a block in inhibition. Here we have demonstrated that SOCS3 can bind to the phosphorylated ITIM of Siglec 7 and target it for proteasomal-mediated degradation with the concurrent loss of SOCS3. This is the first time that degradation of SOCS3 has been observed in correlation with its target. We have also shown that SOCS3 overrides the inhibitory effect of Siglec 7 on cytokine-induced proliferation, which may be a novel means of regulating cytokine responses. CD33-related Siglecs are expressed on cells of the innate immune system and bind sialylated compounds. These receptors contain an ITIM, which binds SHP-1/2 (15Avril T. Floyd H. Lopez F. Vivier E. Crocker P.R. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6841-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of SOCS3 bears 39 and 41% homology with the N-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2, respectively (11Hortner M. Nielsch U. Mayr L.M. Heinrich P.C. Haan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrates that Siglec 7 can bind both SOCS3 and SHP-2 via the phosphorylated ITIM in the same manner as gp130 and the Epo and leptin receptors (11Hortner M. Nielsch U. Mayr L.M. Heinrich P.C. Haan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2516-2526Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These receptors competitively bind SOCS3 and SHP-1/2 to their ITIM-like motifs, suggesting that SOCS3 and SHP-1/2 may compete for binding to Siglec 7. Stimulation by a wide range of cytokines induces SOCS family members, leading to inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway in a negative feedback loop. SOCS proteins target EpoR, Vav, IRS1/2, and FAK for proteasomal degradation (8Elliott J. Johnston J.A. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have identified Siglec 7 as a new target for SOCS3 resulting in proteasomal degradation of the Siglec 7·SOCS3 complex. Like HIV-1, Vif, and some F-box-containing proteins, SOCS3 may be degraded concurrently with its target by the 26 S proteasome (10Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Degradation of any SOCS protein in complex with its target has not previously been shown. The SOCS box of SOCS proteins binds Elongin B/C and Cul5/Rbx1/2 to form an E3 ligase complex, which degrades associated proteins in a proteasome-dependent manner (9Kamura T. Maenaka K. Kotoshiba S. Matsumoto M. Kohda D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Nakayama K.I. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3055-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). We have shown that the E3 ligase complex enhances degradation of Siglec 7 and SOCS3. We propose that SOCS3 binds via its SH2 domain to the phosphorylated ITIM of Siglec 7, whereas the SOCS box binds other components of the E3 ligase complex resulting in degradation and thereby regulating the inhibitory response. Induction of SOCS3 by cytokines and bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide and CpG-DNA (18Crespo A. Filla M.B. Russell S.W. Murphy W.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 19Dalpke A.H. Opper S. Zimmermann S. Heeg K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7082-7089Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) can result in the degradation of Siglec 7 and SOCS3, implying an intricate means of regulating the inflammatory response. Cross-linking CD33-related Siglecs causes inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis (17Vitale C. Romagnani C. Puccetti A. Olive D. Costello R. Chiossone L. Pitto A. Bacigalupo A. Moretta L. Mingari M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5764-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Nutku E. Aizawa H. Hudson S.A. Bochner B.S. Blood. 2003; 101: 5014-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that engagement of Siglec 7 resulted in inhibition of proliferation of a cytokine-dependent cell line, whereas SOCS3 counteracted this effect, possibly because of proteasomal degradation of Siglec 7 and SOCS3. Our results indicate that apoptosis was not involved in Siglec 7-mediated inhibition (data not shown), suggesting the recruitment of SHP-1/2 similar to SIRP1α-mediated inhibition of hormone- and growth factor-induced proliferation (21Stofega M.R. Wang H. Ullrich A. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7112-7117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conditional gene knock-out of SOCS3 has demonstrated that SOCS3 is essential for regulation of gp130 and leptin receptor signaling, but unlike in the SOCS1–/– animals, no enhanced inflammatory response was observed (22Johnston J.A. O'Shea J.J. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Mori H. Hanada R. Hanada T. Aki D. Mashima R. Nishinakamura H. Torisu T. Chien K.R. Yasukawa H. Yoshimura A.

Cell. 1999; 98: 609-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Our data imply that in the absence of SOCS3, Siglec 7 levels may be abnormally regulated, thereby leading to an aberrant inflammatory or cytokine response. SOCS3 has been implicated in the inhibition of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis (25Suzuki A. Hanada T. Mitsuyama K. et al.J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2007834880,"FoxD3 is a forkhead-related transcriptional regulator that is essential for multiple developmental processes in the vertebrate embryo, including neural crest development and maintenance of mammalian stem cell lineages. Recent results demonstrate a requirement for FoxD3 in Xenopus mesodermal development. In the gastrula, FoxD3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in the Spemann organizer to maintain the expression of Nodal-related members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily that induce dorsal mesoderm formation. Here we report that the function of FoxD3 in mesoderm induction is dependent on the recruitment of transcriptional corepressors of the TLE/Groucho family. Structure-function analyses indicate that the transcriptional repression and mesoderm induction activities of FoxD3 are dependent on a C-terminal domain, as well as specific DNA-binding activity conferred by the forkhead domain. The C-terminal domain contains a heptapeptide similar to the eh1/GEH Groucho interaction motif. Deletion and point mutagenesis demonstrated that the FoxD3 eh1/GEH motif is required for both repression of transcription and induction of mesoderm, as well as the direct physical interaction of FoxD3 and Grg4 (Groucho-related gene-4). Consistent with a functional interaction of FoxD3 and Grg4, the transcriptional repression activity of FoxD3 is enhanced by Grg4, and reduced by Grg5, a dominant inhibitory Groucho protein. The results indicate that FoxD3 recruitment of Groucho corepressors is essential for the transcriptional repression of target genes and induction of mesoderm in Xenopus.

The results indicate that FoxD3 recruitment of Groucho corepressors is essential for the transcriptional repression of target genes and induction of mesoderm in Xenopus. The Fox gene family is a diverse group of forkhead-related transcriptional regulators, many of which play essential roles in metazoan embryogenesis and physiology (1Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev.

FoxD3 null embryos do not form a primitive streak, fail to undergo gastrulation or form mesoderm, and die by 6.5 days postcoitum with greatly reduced epiblast cell number (21Hanna L.A. Foreman R.K. Tarasenko I.A. Kessler D.S. Labosky P.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2650-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Extraembryonic defects are also observed in FoxD3 nulls due to a failure of trophoblast progenitors to self-renew and differentiate (23Tompers D.M. Foreman R.K. Wang Q. Kumanova M. Labosky P.A. Dev. Biol. 2005; 285: 126-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, embryonic and trophoblast stem cell lines cannot be established from FoxD3 null embryos (21Hanna L.A. Foreman R.K.

This requirement for FoxD3 in multiple progenitor populations, including embryonic stem cells, trophoblast stem cells, and possibly neural crest stem cells, suggests that FoxD3 may play a conserved role in maintaining cellular multipotency. Whether FoxD3 has similar transcriptional activity and target genes in these distinct progenitor populations remains to be determined. In the Xenopus gastrula, FoxD3 is expressed in the Spemann organizer (17Pohl B.S. Knochel W. Mech. Dev. 2001; 103: 93-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 18Sasai N. Mizuseki K. Sasai Y.

Organizer-restricted expression of FoxD3 is conserved in the zebrafish shield and the chick Hensen node, whereas in the mouse, FoxD3 is expressed throughout the gastrula, including the node (8Odenthal J.

In cells of the organizer, FoxD3 is coexpressed with a variety of developmentally important genes, including Nodal-related members of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily that are essential for the induction and patterning of dorsal mesoderm (28Whitman M. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 29Schier A.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that FoxD3 is essential in the Xenopus gastrula for dorsal mesodermal development, and subsequent formation of the body axis (30Steiner A.B. Engleka M.J. Lu Q. Piwarzyk E.C.

FoxD3 is necessary for the maintenance of Nodal expression in the organizer, and is sufficient for induction of ectopic Nodal expression outside of the organizer. Consistent with a regulatory interaction of FoxD3 with the Nodal pathway, mesoderm induction in response to FoxD3 gain-of-function was dependent on Nodal, and the developmental defects resulting from FoxD3 knockdown were rescued by activation of Nodal signaling. These studies indicate that FoxD3 function is required in the Spemann organizer to maintain Nodal expression, thus promoting dorsal mesoderm induction and axis formation in Xenopus. Interestingly, a fusion protein containing the Engrailed repression domain and the FoxD3 DNA-binding domain mimicked the mesoderm inducing activity of FoxD3, whereas a VP16 activator fusion protein did not (30Steiner A.B. Engleka M.J. Lu Q. Piwarzyk E.C. Yaklichkin S. Lefebvre J.L. Walters J.W. Pineda-Salgado L. Labosky P.A. Kessler D.S. Development. 2006; 133: 4827-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that FoxD3 functions as a transcriptional repressor to maintain Nodal expression and induce mesoderm, suggesting that FoxD3 promotes Nodal expression in the Spemann organizer by repressing a negative regulator of Nodal. The conclusion that FoxD3 functions as a transcriptional repressor in Xenopus mesodermal development is consistent with the repression function of FoxD3 observed in previous cell culture and neural crest studies (9Sutton J.

The mechanisms of transcriptional repression by FoxD3, including the identification of functional domains and transcriptional cofactors, are yet to be determined in any system. Multiple developmentally important transcriptional regulators repress target gene transcription via interactions with Groucho family corepressors. Groucho proteins are widely expressed, non-DNA-binding transcriptional repressors that are recruited to regulatory sites by specific DNA-binding proteins through conserved protein interaction motifs (32Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 33Courey A.J. Jia S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2786-2796PubMed Google Scholar, 34Chen G. Courey A.J.

At target promoters, Groucho corepressors recruit Rpd3-related class I histone deacetylases that generate a closed chromatin conformation, preventing transcriptional initiation (33Courey A.J. Jia S.

A number of transcriptional regulatory proteins have been identified in Drosophila that recruit Groucho to repress transcription during development, including the basic helix-loop-helix protein Hairy, the homeodomain protein Engrailed, and the NFκB-related protein Dorsal, which regulate neurogenesis, segment polarity, and dorsal-ventral patterning, respectively (37Paroush Z.

Brian E. Roose J. Clevers H. Destree O. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Grg4 is a functional transcriptional corepressor, whereas Grg5 lacks several essential domains and functions as a dominant inhibitory Groucho (43Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Similar to Drosophila Groucho, Xenopus Groucho-related proteins have been shown to interact with Hairy1, Six1, and Tcf3 to regulate myogenesis, neurogenesis, and dorsal determination, along with other developmental regulators (43Roose J.

Identifying additional DNA-binding proteins that interact with Groucho to mediate target gene repression is important for further defining the essential developmental functions of Groucho corepressors. Here we report the results of mechanistic studies that identify the functional domains and cofactors mediating the transcriptional and developmental functions of FoxD3. The transcriptional repression and mesoderm induction activities of FoxD3 require DNA-binding specificity conferred by the forkhead domain, and the transcriptional repression function of a C-terminal domain containing a heptapeptide sequence similar to the eh1/GEH Groucho interaction motif. This eh1/GEH motif is essential for both the transcriptional repression and mesoderm induction activities of FoxD3, and for the direct physical interaction of FoxD3 and Grg4. In support of a functional interaction of FoxD3 and Groucho corepressors, Grg4 synergistically enhanced, and Grg5 inhibited the transcriptional repression activity of FoxD3. The results establish a molecular mechanism for the transcriptional and developmental functions of FoxD3. Embryos and Microinjection—Xenopus embryos were collected, fertilized, injected, and cultured, and animal pole explants prepared and cultured as previously described (46Yao J. Kessler D.S. Tuan R.S. Lo C.W. Methods in Molecular Biology, Developmental Biology Protocols. III. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999Google Scholar). Embryonic stage was determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (47Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Second Ed. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1967: 576-585Google Scholar). Capped, in vitro transcribed mRNA for microinjection was synthesized from linearized DNA templates using the SP6 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) and 10 nl of RNA solution was injected per embryo. For examination of the subcellular localization of FoxD3-GFP fusion proteins, animal pole explants were dissociated in calcium-free medium as described (48Wilson P.A. Melton D.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 676-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and individual cells were viewed using Nomarski optics and fluorescence microscopy. FoxD3 and Groucho Expression Constructs—The FoxD3 constructs described in this study were generated using the pCS2+, pCS2-NLS, pCS2-eGFP, pCS2-Gal4DBD, or pCS2-GST vectors (49Rupp R.A. Snider L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1311-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) (and this study). A previously described pCS2-FoxD3 subclone containing the open reading frame (nucleotides 172–1287) of Xenopus FoxD3 was used to generate the constructs used in this study (30Steiner A.B. Engleka M.J. Lu Q. Piwarzyk E.C. Yaklichkin S. Lefebvre J.L. Walters J.W. Pineda-Salgado L. Labosky P.A. Kessler D.S. Development. 2006; 133: 4827-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These constructs include pCS2-FoxD3AA(N140A/H144A), pCS2-FoxD3-FoxH1WH, pCS2-NLS-FoxD3WH-(415–783), pCS2-NLS-FoxD3ΔN-(361–1287), pCS2-NLS-FoxD3ΔC-(172–819), pCS2-FoxD3F>E(F297E), pCS2-FoxD3A6(GEH>A6), pCS2-FoxD3ΔGEH-(172–1062), pCS2-FoxD3-GFP, pCS2-FoxD3AA-GFP, pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3-(172–1287), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3AA(N140A/H144A), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3N-(172–408), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3C-(751–1287), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3C-F>E(F297E), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3C-A6(GEH>A6), pCS2-Gal4DBD-FoxD3C-ΔGEH-(751–1062), pCS2-GST-FoxD3-(172–1287), pCS2-GST-FoxD3C-(751–1287), pCS2-GST-FoxD3C-F>E(F297E), pCS2-GST-FoxD3C-A6(GEH>A6), and pCS2-GST-FoxD3C-ΔGEH-(751–1062). A PCR-based approach was used to generate mutations within the FoxD3 DNA-binding domain (pCS2-FoxD3AA) and eh1/GEH domain (pCS2-FoxD3F>E and pCS2-FoxD3A6). For each mutagenesis, pCS2-FoxD3 plasmid was used as template for outward-directed PCR using overlapping primers encoding the mutated sequence. Wild-type plasmid DNA was removed by DpnI digestion of the methylated template DNA, and the amplification products were then ligated and transformed into XL1-Blue. The introduced mutations and the integrity of the open reading frames were verified by sequencing and in vitro translation. A detailed description of the Xenopus FoxD3 constructs used in this study is available on request. Grg4 and Grg5 mRNAs were synthesized from pGlo-myc-Grg4 and pGlo-myc-Grg5 (43Roose J. Molenaar M.

Gal4-UAS-Luciferase Reporter Transcriptional Assays—Xenopus embryos were injected in the animal pole at the one-cell stage with in vitro transcribed RNA encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain or Gal4-FoxD3 fusion proteins. At the two-cell stage, one blastomere was injected with 100 pg of pGL3–5xUAS-Gsc-Luciferase (Firefly luciferase under the control of five Gal4-binding sites and the -104 Goosecoid minimal promoter) in combination with 10 pg of pGL3-CMV-Renilla internal control (Renilla luciferase under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter). Animal pole explants prepared at the midblastula stage were collected at the midgastrula stage and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) and a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). The data presented are the results of at least three independent experiments, with error bars representing S.E. A two-tailed Student's t test was used to calculate p values. Protein Interaction Assays and Western Blotting Analysis— One-cell stage embryos were injected with in vitro transcribed RNA encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), or GST-FoxD3 fusions proteins alone, or in combination with myc-Grg4 mRNA (43Roose J. Molenaar M. Peterson J. Hurenkamp J. Brantjes H. Moerer P. van de Wetering M. Destree O. Clevers H. Nature. 1998; 395: 608-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Embryos collected at the midgastrula stage were homogenized at 4 °C in interaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× Roche protease inhibitor mixture). Cleared supernantants were incubated with an equal volume of a 50% suspension of glutathione-coupled Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1 h with gentle agitation. Beads recovered by low speed spin were washed in 25 volumes of interaction buffer and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. Cleared supernatants and bead eluates were subjected to Western blot analysis using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-myc monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and detected with a 1:3000 dilution of peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For standard Western analysis, embryos were lysed (10 μl/embryo) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, supplemented with protease inhibitors, extracts were cleared by centrifugation, and half an embryo equivalent was loaded per well. An anti-Gal4DBD polyclonal antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:1000 dilution or an anti-FoxD3 polyclonal antibody (23Tompers D.M. Foreman R.K. Wang Q. Kumanova M. Labosky P.A. Dev.

As a loading control, duplicate blots were analyzed with a monoclonal antibody against the ubiquitous hnRNPK at a 1:1000 dilution (51Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). FoxD3 Mesoderm Induction Is Dependent on the Specific DNA-binding Activity of the Forkhead Domain—Fox family proteins are characterized by a conserved 100-residue forkhead domain that is required for DNA-binding activity (1Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 52Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). FoxD3 orthologs contain a highly conserved, centrally positioned forkhead/winged-helix (WH) domain (residues 92–192 in Xenopus FoxD3), and regions N-terminal and C-terminal to the WH domain are less well conserved and lack previously identified functional motifs (Fig. 1A). It is predicted that mesoderm induction by FoxD3 is dependent on sequence-specific DNA-binding activity conferred by the WH domain. To examine the requirement for FoxD3 DNA-binding activity in mesoderm induction, two highly conserved DNA contact residues of the WH domain were replaced with alanine (N140A/H144A), a pair of mutations previously shown to ablate the DNA-binding activity of Fox proteins (Fig. 1A) (53Yan H. Liao X. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 3248-3254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 54Jin C. Marsden I. Chen X. Liao X. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mesoderm-inducing activity of this mutated FoxD3 protein (FoxD3AA) was examined in animal pole explants. At the one-cell stage, RNA encoding native FoxD3 or FoxD3AA (100 pg) was injected into the animal pole, and explants prepared at the blastula stage were collected at the tailbud stage for RT-PCR analysis of mesoderm induction (Fig. 1B). Whereas native FoxD3 strongly induced the expression of Muscle Actin (somites) and Collagen II (notochord), FoxD3AA had greatly reduced activity at equal or higher doses (100–500 pg), demonstrating the importance of DNA-binding activity for mesoderm induction by FoxD3. To determine whether sequence specificity of DNA binding by the FoxD3 WH domain is essential for mesoderm induction, the FoxD3 WH domain was replaced with the WH domain of FoxH1, another Fox protein involved in mesodermal development that has a distinct DNA binding sequence specificity (13Cheung M. Chaboissier M.C. Mynett A. Hirst E. Schedl A. Briscoe J. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 179-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 55Watanabe M. Whitman M. Development. 1999; 126: 5621-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). In the animal pole explant assay, this WH swap protein (FoxD3/H1WH) failed to induce mesoderm, indicating that the sequence specificity of DNA binding conferred by the FoxD3 WH domain is required for mesoderm induction (Fig. 1B). In addition, the FoxD3 WH domain alone (residues 82–204 fused to a nuclear localization signal) did not induce mesoderm, indicating that the WH domain does not have intrinsic mesoderm induction activity (Fig. 1, A and B). For each of the modified forms of FoxD3 (FoxD3AA, FoxD3/H1WH, and FoxD3WH), protein products were examined by in vitro translation and expression in embryos to confirm the integrity of the open reading frames and stability of the proteins (data not shown). The results indicate that mesoderm induction by FoxD3 is dependent on sequence-specific DNA-binding activity conferred by the WH domain and additional functional domains located either N-terminal or C-terminal to the WH domain. To assess the subcellular localization of FoxD3 and the FoxD3 WH mutant, fusion proteins containing green fluorescent protein were generated. At the one-cell stage, RNA encoding FoxD3-GFP, FoxD3AA-GFP, or GFP was injected into the animal pole, explants prepared at the late blastula stage were dissociated in calcium-free medium, and protein localization was examined in individual cells by Nomarski and fluorescence microscopy. Whereas GFP protein was distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, FoxD3-GFP and the FoxD3AA-GFP were concentrated in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1, C–E). Similarly, FoxD3/H1WH and FoxD3WH were also localized to the nucleus (data not shown). When tested for the ability to induce mesoderm, the activity of FoxD3-GFP was identical to native FoxD3, whereas FoxD3AA-GFP did not induce mesoderm (data not shown). Therefore, exogenous FoxD3 is localized to the nuclei of cells competent to form mesoderm in response to FoxD3. Furthermore, the results confirm that the lack of activity for FoxD3AA, FoxD3/H1WH, and FoxD3WH is not due to protein mislocalization. The C Terminus of FoxD3 Is Required for Mesoderm Induction and Transcriptional Repression—To identify additional functional domains required for FoxD3 mesoderm induction, deletion mutants lacking sequences N-terminal (FoxD3ΔN) or C-terminal (FoxD3ΔC) to the WH domain were generated and tested (Fig. 2A). Native FoxD3, FoxD3ΔN, or FoxD3ΔC were expressed in animal pole explants at low (100 pg) or high (300 pg) dose to assess mesoderm-inducing activity. Induction of Muscle Actin at the tailbud stage indicated that"
https://openalex.org/W2072922679,"Environmental stresses may lead to selection for hypermutator bacterial cells, which have an increased chance of generating beneficial variants. With stress removal, cost of mutation exceeds the fitness advantage, selecting against hypermutators. Hypermutators arise through several mechanisms, including inactivation of mismatch repair genes (MMR) or induction of error-prone polymerases. Helicobacter pylori may provide an alternative mechanism of stress-induced mutagenesis, since it lacks the MMR genes and error-prone polymerases found in other bacterial species, and possesses an endogenously high mutation frequency. In this study, we expose H. pylori strains to reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species, stressors found in their natural environment. These exposures directly resulted in elevated rates of spontaneous point mutation, deletion between direct repeats, and intergenomic recombination. We demonstrate that these effects are transient and do not involve selection for hypermutator strains. That H. pylori possesses direct repeats in regions where potential gene rearrangements can occur suggests a mechanism for targeted mutation in response to stress that avoids the deleterious fitness costs of fixed hypermutation. These studies provide a new paradigm for adaptation under increased selective pressures that may be present in other prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2038880025,"MafA is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that regulates gene expression in both the neuroretina and pancreas. Within the pancreas, MafA is exclusively expressed in the beta cells and is involved in insulin gene transcription, insulin secretion, and beta cell survival. The expression of the mafA gene within beta cells is known to increase in response to high glucose levels by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we demonstrate that pyruvate, which is produced by glycolysis from glucose, is not sufficient to induce mafA gene expression compared with high glucose. This suggests that the signal for MafA induction is independent of ATP levels and that a metabolic event occurring upstream of pyruvate production leads to the induction of MafA. Furthermore, insulin secretion mediated by high glucose is not important for MafA expression. However, the addition of glucosamine to beta cell lines stimulates MafA expression in the absence of high glucose, and inhibition of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in the presence of high glucose abolishes MafA induction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expression of UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase, the enzyme mediating O-linked glycosylation of cytosolic and nuclear proteins, is essential for glucose-dependent MafA expression. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of N-acetylglucosaminidase, the enzyme involved in the removal of the O-GlcNAc modification from proteins, with O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate stimulates MafA expression under low glucose conditions.

Type II diabetes is a complex disease caused by defects in the synthesis of insulin, insulin secretion, and insulin action. These defects alter glucose homeostasis, leading to hyperglycemia, glucotoxicity, and the secondary complications associated with diabetes (1LeRoith D. Am. J.

The maintenance of glucose homeostasis thus depends on the appropriate synthesis and secretion of the polypeptide hormone insulin, which is produced solely within the beta cells of the pancreas. High blood glucose levels induce beta cells to immediately secrete insulin and a more prolonged exposure to high glucose stimulates beta cells to increase insulin synthesis (1LeRoith D. Am. J.

The glucose-dependent transcription of insulin is regulated by a number of cis-acting elements within 350 base pairs upstream of the insulin gene start site. The A3, E1, and C1 elements of the insulin promoter are critical for glucose-dependent insulin gene transcription (7Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E.

However, Pdx-1, Beta2, and MafA have been shown to synergize to form an active transcriptional complex at the insulin promoter leading to the glucose-dependent transcription of the insulin gene (7Melloul D.

The mechanisms by which high glucose levels modulate insulin gene transcription remain to be established. Insulin itself, via an autocrine feedback mechanism, has been suggested to stimulate signaling events leading to insulin synthesis (18Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Berggren P.O. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Glucose has also been shown to stimulate various signaling pathways leading to the translocation of Pdx-1 and Beta2 from the cytosol into the nucleus (19MacFarlane W.M. Read M.L. Gilligan M.

Despite the increasing body of information for how Beta2 and Pdx-1 are regulated by glucose, the signaling events regulating MafA-mediated insulin gene transcription in beta cells are not well understood. However, MafA mRNA and protein levels are increased in response to high glucose levels (12Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol.

The end-product of the HBP is UDP-GlcNAc, which is used as the substrate for N- and O-linked glycosylation of proteins. The HBP has been shown to be a sensor of nutrient status and is involved in regulating transcriptional and translational events (22Akimoto Y. Kreppel L.K. Hirano H. Hart G.W.

UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (OGT) is the enzyme that uses UDP-GlcNAc as its substrate, leading to the O-glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of numerous cytsolic and nuclear proteins including transcription factors and proteins involved in signal transduction. As such, O-GlcNAcylation is known to regulate the expression of various genes (30Rumberger J.M. Wu T. Hering M.A. Marshall S. J. Biol.

In many cases, the same residues within a protein that are O-GlcNAc-modified can also be phosphorylated. Furthermore, the modification of the same residue in a protein by O-GlcNAcylation or phosphorylation may impose opposite effects on its function. O-GlcN-Acylation is known to affect the stability, localization, interaction, and activity of a variety of proteins (31Zachara N.E. Hart G.W. Biochim. Biophys.

In this report, we provide evidence that flux through the HBP and O-GlcNAcylation are involved in MafA expression induced by high glucose in beta cell lines. The presented data may be useful in the development of novel clinical interventions to treat diabetes. Chemicals—d-glucose, l-glucose, fructose, mannose, pyruvate, 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG), 6-deoxy-d-glucose, 3-O-methyl-d-glucose, glucosamine, insulin from bovine pancreas, potassium chloride (KCl), 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), and azaserine were obtained from Sigma. O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals Inc. (Ontario, Canada). Cell culture media were obtained from Atlanta Biologicals (Lawrenceville, GA). Cell Culture—Mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) cells of passage 19–30 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 100μm β-mercaptoethanol (36Miyazaki J.

For each experiment, MIN6 cells were grown overnight (16–18 h) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing d-glucose, l-glucose, fructose, mannose, or pyruvate as indicated in the figure legends. Mouse betaTC3 insulinoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm Hepes buffer, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (37Efrat S.

For experiments utilizing betaTC3 cells, cells were grown overnight (16–18 h) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing d-glucose, pyruvate, glucosamine, DON, or PUGNAc as indicated. Western Blotting—For Western blotting, whole-cell extracts from MIN6 cells were prepared as described previously (38Mosley A.L. Corbett J.A. Ozcan S. Mol.

Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Osmonics Inc.). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 1× TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk. After blocking, membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either Pdx-1 (gift from Dr. Chris Wright, Vanderbilt University), MafA (Calbiochem), Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), β-actin (Sigma), OGT (40Andrali S.S.

Membranes were washed four times for 10 min in TTBS and subsequently incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and proteins were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Real Time PCR—Real time RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (39Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. J. Biol.

Briefly, RNA was isolated from MIN6 cells using the RNeasy® minikit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the enhanced avian HS RT-PCR kit (Sigma) by following the manufacturer's protocol, after treatment with DNase I (Sigma) in order to remove any potentially contaminating genomic DNA. Real time amplification of the cDNA was performed using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). The oligonucleotide primers used in this study have previously been described (15Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol.

Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol.

Persaud S.J. Jones P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Real time PCRs were performed on an Mx4000 instrument (Stratagene) and the obtained data were analyzed as described previously (39Mosley A.L. Ozcan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54241-54247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41Finlin B.S. Mosley A.L. Crump S.M. Correll R.N. Ozcan S. Satin J. Andres D.A. J. Biol.

Fold differences in MafA and insulin expression, normalized to β-actin levels, were calculated using the formula 2ΔΔCt (43Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (122760) Google Scholar). In this equation, Ct refers to the cycle threshold at the time in which the fluorescence intensity reaches a level above the background fluorescence, and ΔΔCt = (CtMafA or insulin – Ctactin)treatment x – (CtMafA or insulin – Ctactin)treatment y. Treatment x, for example, represents data obtained from cells incubated under 25 mm glucose conditions, whereas treatment y represents data obtained from 1 mm incubated cells (as in Fig. 1B). Therefore, the data are expressed as -fold increases in mRNA levels in cells cultured under the conditions described in each figure legend (such as 25 mm glucose) over the amount of mRNA levels in cells treated with pyruvate or 1 mm glucose. Cell Viability Assay—Cell viability was measured via the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay (44Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46159) Google Scholar) using the Cell Proliferation Kit I from Roche Applied Science according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 60,000 MIN6 cells/well were cultured into U-bottom 96-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences). After ∼24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 mm glucose, 20 mm pyruvate, or 25 mm glucose without serum for 16–18 h. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with 100 μl/well fresh 1 mm glucose, 20 mm pyruvate, or 25 mm glucose along with 10 μl/well of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide labeling reagent (final concentration 0.5 mg/ml) supplied within the kit. The cells were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5.2% CO2. The resulting formazan crystals were solubilized with 100 μl of the solubilization solution, and the optical density of the solubilized formazan product was measured at 562 nm with a μQuant™ microplate spectrophotometer (BioTek Instruments, Inc.) plate reader. The data are expressed as A562 for each treatment type. Insulin Secretion Assay—Insulin secretion from MIN6 cells was determined as previously described with the noted exceptions (41Finlin B.S. Mosley A.L. Crump S.M. Correll R.N. Ozcan S. Satin J. Andres D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41864-41871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 cells were equilibrated for 2 h in 1× KRBH buffer (119 mm NaCl, 4.74 mm KCl, 2.54 mm CaCl2, 1.19 mm MgSO4, 1.19 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin). After equilibration, cells were washed twice with 1× KRBH buffer and incubated for 1 h in 1× KRBH buffer containing 1 mm glucose, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm pyruvate, or 20 mm pyruvate plus 50 mm KCl. After this incubation, the insulin concentration in the medium was determined using the mouse ultrasensitive insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ALPCO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of insulin secreted (ng/ml), normalized to total protein levels (mg/ml), was calculated, and the data were expressed as -fold changes over the amount of insulin secreted (ng/ml insulin versus mg/ml total protein) from MIN6 cells incubated with 1 mm glucose. ATP Measurement—ATP levels were measured in MIN6 cells cultured overnight on 20 mm pyruvate, 1 mm, 5 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 20 mm, or 25 mm glucose. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and subsequently lysed with a somatic cell ATP-releasing reagent (Sigma). The released intracellular ATP was then measured using the ATP bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described for INS-1 beta cells (45Lam N.T. Cheung A.T. Riedel M.J. Light P.E. Cheeseman C.I. Kieffer T.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 32: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ATP measurements were carried out within 96-well, white Chromalux plates (DYNEX Technologies) using an Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices). The instrument was preset to integrate the amount of light produced over a 5-s interval with a 2-s initial delay. The amount of intracellular ATP (pg/pl) was calculated based on an ATP standard curve that was generated from ATP standards provided within the kit. The calculated intracellular ATP value (pg/pl) was then normalized to total protein levels (pg/pl). siRNA Assay—UDP-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (OGT) and negative control (Silencer® negative control 1) siRNAs were designed by and purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). The siRNAs were transfected at a final concentration of 2 μg per 2 × 106 MIN6 cells using the transfection reagent nucleofector kit (Amaxa Inc.) and the Nucleofector II Device (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 60 h after transfection, whole-cell extracts were prepared, and Western blotting was preformed to detect OGT, MafA, and β-actin protein levels. Number of Independent Experiments—Unless otherwise noted in the figure legends, the data shown represent averages of three or four independent experiments ± S.D. values. TBP was used as a loading control for Western blots. High Glucose, but Not Pyruvate, Induces MafA Expression—Previous data indicate that MafA mRNA and protein levels are induced by high glucose in both insulinoma cell lines and isolated rat islets (12Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Kajihara M. Sone H. Amemiya M. Katoh Y.

Poitout V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism controlling this glucose-regulated event is unknown. To investigate the detailed mechanisms of this regulation, we studied MafA expression by glucose in the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 and betaTC3. Consistent with previous work (12Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Kajihara M. Sone H. Amemiya M. Katoh Y.

Poitout V. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11887-11894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we found that MafA protein levels increased in MIN6 cells cultured under high glucose concentrations (25 mm) compared with low (1 mm) glucose or 20 mm pyruvate-incubated cells (Fig. 1A). TBP and Pdx-1 protein levels remained unchanged under these conditions (Fig. 1A). Real time RT-PCR was utilized to confirm that the increase in MafA protein levels is due to an increase in MafA mRNA levels. MafA mRNA levels (normalized to β-actin mRNA) were about 2-fold increased on high glucose compared with low glucose-incubated MIN6 cells (Fig. 1B). These data are consistent with previous work suggesting that glucose induces MafA expression by enhancing its transcription (12Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The metabolism of glucose via glycolysis yields pyruvate; however, treatment of MIN6 cells with 20 mm pyruvate did not lead to induction of MafA mRNA or protein levels compared with high glucose (Fig. 1, A and B). The cell viability of MIN6 cells cultured on 1 mm glucose or 20 mm pyruvate was not substantially different from MIN6 cells cultured on 25 mm glucose (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that the observed differences in MafA levels are not due to differences in cell viability. Therefore, these data indicate that induction of MafA expression requires a signal/metabolite upstream of pyruvate. Induction of MafA expression by high levels of glucose was also observed using the mouse insulinoma cell line betaTC3 (Fig. 1C). Hexose Metabolism, but Not Glucose Uptake, Glucose Phosphorylation, or Osmotic Stress, Is Required to Increase MafA Protein Levels—We tested the idea that the induction of MafA expression requires the general metabolism of hexose sugars by incubating MIN6 cells with 2 or 20 mm mannose or fructose (Fig. 2A). Like high glucose, the addition of high mannose (20 mm) also stimulated MafA expression, whereas the addition of 2 or 20 mm fructose had no effect (Fig. 2A). Mannose has been shown to be metabolized by beta cells, but fructose is not metabolized in the absence of glucose (46Sener A. Giroix M.H. Malaisse W.J. Eur. J.

https://openalex.org/W1968971284,"Efficient induction of apoptosis requires not only the activation of death-promoting proteins but also the inactivation of inhibitors of cell death. ARC (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that antagonizes both central apoptosis pathways. Despite its potent inhibition of cell death, cells that express abundant ARC eventually succumb. A possible explanation is that ARC protein levels decrease dramatically in response to death stimuli. The mechanisms that mediate decreases in ARC protein levels during apoptosis and whether these decreases initiate the subsequent cell death are not known. Here we show that endogenous ARC protein levels decrease in response to death stimuli in a variety of cell contexts as well as in a model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion in intact mice. Decreases in ARC protein levels are not explained by alterations in the abundance of ARC transcripts. Rather, pulse-chase experiments show that decreases in steady state ARC protein levels during apoptosis result from marked destabilization of ARC protein. ARC protein destabilization, in turn, is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway, as mutation of ARC ubiquitin acceptor residues stabilizes ARC protein and preserves its steady state levels during apoptosis. In addition, this degradation-resistant ARC mutant exhibits improved cytoprotection. We conclude that decreases in ARC protein levels in response to death stimuli are mediated by increased ARC protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway.

Moreover, these data demonstrate that decreases in ARC protein levels are a trigger, and not merely a consequence, of the ensuing cell death. Apoptosis is activated by two major pathways, one involving death receptors (extrinsic pathway) and the other involving the mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum (intrinsic pathway) (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4059) Google Scholar). Each of these pathways is opposed by several inhibitory proteins, which characteristically act on only one or the other pathway and antagonize very circumscribed step(s) within that pathway. For example, FLIP (Fas-associated death domain protein-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein) inhibits the extrinsic pathway by interfering with the activation of procaspase-8 in the Death-inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) (2Peter M.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 382 (Pt. 2): e1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In contrast, Bcl-2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 protein) and XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) are examples of intrinsic pathway inhibitors with Bcl-2 blocking permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane via undetermined mechanisms (3Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S.

Studies in Drosophila and mammalian cells have shown that efficient cell killing requires neutralization of inhibitory proteins as well as activation of death-promoting proteins (5Salvesen G.S.

ARC 3The abbreviations used are: ARC, apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin. (apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain) is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis that is expressed primarily in terminally differentiated cells, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes and neurons (8Geertman R.

Levalley A.J. Ashton A.W. Jasmin J.F. Czaja M.T. Lin E.Y. Armstrong R.C. Pollard J.W. Kitsis R.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Wang M. Qanungo S.

In contrast to most endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis, ARC antagonizes both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways (12Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the extrinsic pathway is mediated by non-homotypic death-fold interactions of ARC with Fas (CD95/Apo-1) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) that preclude the conventional homotypic interactions required for death-inducing signaling complex assembly (12Nam Y.J.

Inhibition of the intrinsic pathway involves interactions between ARC and the C-terminal regulatory domain of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) that prevent the conformational activation of Bax and its translocation to the mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli (12Nam Y.J.

Similarly, inactivation of ARC in the mouse increases cardiac myocyte apoptosis in models of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion and hemodynamic overload (18Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N.

These observations indicate that ARC is an important inhibitor of apoptosis in vivo. Despite its inhibition of both central apoptosis pathways, even cells that express high base-line levels of ARC can be induced to undergo apoptosis. The susceptibility of ARC-expressing cells to apoptosis has been hypothesized to be due to the fact that ARC protein levels decrease markedly during apoptosis in some systems. These include hypoxia and oxidative stress in the H9c2 muscle cell line and in primary neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, ischemia-reperfusion in isolated, perfused rat hearts, and human heart failure (12Nam Y.J.

The mechanisms responsible for reductions in ARC protein levels during apoptosis and whether these decreases are causally related to the subsequent cell death are not known. In this study, we show that decreases in ARC protein abundance in response to death stimuli are caused by destabilization of ARC protein. This process is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Moreover, mutation of ubiquitin acceptor residues renders ARC resistant to degradation, maintains its steady state levels, and enhances cytoprotection. Plasmids and Cloning—Mammalian expression vectors for ARC were generated by subcloning the open reading frame of human ARC into pcDNA3.1/pcDNA3.1-HA/pcDNA3.1-Myc-His B/pcDNA3.1-V5-His (Invitrogen). Mammalian expression vectors for procaspase-8 and ubiquitin were obtained from Drs. Gabriel Nunez and Wei Gu, respectively. Mutants derived from pcDNA3.1-ARC-HA were generated using the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell Culture and Transfection— H9c2, MCF-7, HeLa, and HEK293 cell lines (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared as described (21Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen). H9c2 or HEK293 ARC stable transfectants were generated using Hygromycin (Invitrogen)-resistant vectors. Antibodies, Immunoblotting, Immunostaining, and Immunoprecipitations—Polyclonal ARC antisera from Cayman or as generated by Dr. M. Crow (14Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. II I Nunez G. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: e70-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for immunoblotting. The Cayman antibody was also used for immunoprecipitations. A polyclonal ARC antibody (Neomarkers) was used for immunostaining. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies against ubiquitin, HA, Myc (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and α-tubulin (Sigma) were used. Immunostaining was performed on mouse heart sections as previously described (10Mercier I. Vuolo M. Madan R. Xue X. Levalley A.J. Ashton A.W. Jasmin J.F. Czaja M.T. Lin E.Y. Armstrong R.C. Pollard J.W. Kitsis R.N. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 682-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunoblots and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (12Nam Y.J. Mani K.

Assessment of ARC mRNA Levels—ARC mRNA levels were assessed using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates with TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR was performed using the DNA Master Plus SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science) with a LightCycler PCR machine (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s directions. ARC primers were forward 5′-TGTGCCCAGCAAACAGTG-3′, reverse 5′-CTGGGCATGAAGGGTCATAG-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers were forward 5′-TGCCACTCAGAAGACTGTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′. The abundance of ARC mRNA was normalized to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. Assessment of ARC Protein Stability—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (ATCC) for 2 h, following which cells were metabolically labeled with 500 μCi of [35S]cysteine (ICN) for 10 h. After labeling, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and chased with complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for the indicated times. Lysates were immunoprecipitated for ARC, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Cell Death Assay—Cell death was assessed by nuclear condensation as described (12Nam Y.J. Mani K.

Mouse Ischemia-Reperfusion Model—Male, 8–10-week-old C57Bl6 mice were subjected to sham operation or ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and mouse heart sections and tissue homogenates prepared as previously described (22Tarzami S.T. Miao W. Mani K. Lopez L. Factor S.M. Berman J.W. Kitsis R.N. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2387-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Steady State ARC Protein Levels Decrease in Response to Death Stimuli in Various Systems—Previous work in muscle cells has shown that ARC protein levels decrease in response to oxidative stress and hypoxia (12Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Ekhterae D. Lin Z. Lundberg M.S. Crow M.T. Brosius F.C. II I Nunez G. Circ.

Commun. 2005; 336: 740-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To test the generality of this observation, we studied a variety of cell types (including muscle cells and cancer cells that express endogenous ARC) and apoptotic inducers (including oxidative stress, simulated ischemia, doxorubicin, and etoposide). Oxidative stress (hydrogen peroxide) stimulated a brisk and marked decrease in endogenous ARC protein levels in H9c2 cells (skeletal myocyte-like cell line derived from embryonic rat heart), MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cell line), and HeLa cells (human cervical cancer cell line) (Fig. 1A). These decreases in ARC protein abundance were specific as steady state levels of α-tubulin in the same cells remained constant or decreased only modestly. Endogenous ARC protein levels in H9c2 cells also decreased in response to simulated ischemia (serum/glucose/oxygen deprivation) (Fig. 1A). Doxorubicin decreased endogenous ARC protein levels in H9c2 cells (Fig. 1A), but not in MCF-7 cells (not shown). Etoposide did not affect ARC protein levels in any of these cell types (not shown). Thus, although ARC protein levels are unaffected in some contexts, they decrease in response to oxidative stress in a variety of cell types. Because oxidative stress is an integral component of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (23Becker L.B. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 61: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), we postulated that endogenous ARC protein levels would decrease in the hearts of mice subjected to transient left coronary artery ligation. Sham operation or 45 min of ischemia alone, conditions that induce little cardiac myocyte apoptosis (24Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 25Bialik S. Geenen D.L. Sasson I.E. Cheng R. Horner J.W. Evans S.M. Lord E.M. Koch C.J. Kitsis R.N. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), had little effect on ARC protein levels (Fig. 1B, panels b–d and f). In contrast, ischemia followed by reperfusion, which elicits significant cardiac myocyte apoptosis (24Gottlieb R.A. Burleson K.O. Kloner R.A. Babior B.M. Engler R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 1621-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar, 26Lee P. Sata M. Lefer D.J. Factor S.M. Walsh K. Kitsis R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H456-H463Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), induced marked decreases in the abundance of ARC protein (Fig. 1B, panels g and h). Similar results were obtained by Western analysis (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that endogenous ARC levels in the myocardium decrease dramatically in response to ischemia-reperfusion in vivo. ARC Protein Is Destabilized during Apoptosis—To delineate the mechanism by which apoptotic stimuli decrease ARC protein levels, we first assessed whether ARC mRNA abundance decreases during apoptosis. ARC protein levels decrease most markedly during the first 2 h of hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in H9c2 cells (Fig. 1A). Despite this, ARC mRNA levels remained unchanged at 2 h and decreased only modestly at 4–8 h, as assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (Fig. 2). Although changes in ARC mRNA levels may play some role in regulating ARC protein levels, these data indicate the kinetics and magnitude of the decreases in ARC protein levels during apoptosis cannot be accounted for by alterations in ARC mRNA abundance. We next considered whether the stability of ARC protein decreases during apoptosis, an especially attractive hypothesis in light of the rapidity with which ARC protein levels decrease. As measured by pulse-chase, the half-life of endogenous ARC protein was ∼16 h in healthy MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A). A similar half-life was observed for transfected human ARC in healthy H9c2 cells (Fig. 3B) and HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). In contrast, treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide reduced the half-life of ARC protein to ∼2–4 h in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3A) and H9c2 cells (Fig. 3B). Similarly, activation of apoptosis using procaspase-8 reduced ARC half-life to 4 h in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). We conclude that ARC protein stability decreases markedly in response to apoptotic stimuli and suggest that increases in ARC protein degradation play an important role in the decreases in steady state ARC protein levels during apoptosis. ARC Undergoes Polyubiquitination in Response to Apoptotic Stimuli—To test whether the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is involved in ARC degradation, we first asked whether ARC could be a substrate for polyubiquitination, which targets proteins for degradation in the proteasome. The co-expression of ubiquitin and ARC in non-apoptotic MCF-7 cells resulted in polyubiquitinated forms of ARC (Fig. 4A, lane 3), the abundance of which was markedly increased by the 20 S proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (Fig. 4A, lane 4). These data indicate that ARC can undergo ubiquitination. We next tested whether ARC does undergo ubiquitination in response to apoptotic stimuli. Expression of procaspase-8 in HEK293 cells induced polyubiquitination of co-expressed ARC. Moreover, hydrogen peroxide treatment of MCF-7 cells or primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes stimulated polyubiquitination of endogenous ARC. Thus, ARC protein undergoes polyubiquitination in various cell types in response to death stimuli. The Ubiquitin-Proteasomal Pathway Is Responsible for Decreases in Steady State ARC Protein Levels during Apoptosis—To determine whether the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway is responsible for the decreased abundance of ARC protein during apoptosis, we created an ARC mutant that is severely resistant to ubiquitination. Ubiquitin moieties are covalently linked to the ɛ-amino groups of lysine residues in the degradation substrate (27Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2943) Google Scholar). ARC contains lysines at positions 17, 68, and 163. Simultaneous mutation of all three of these lysines to arginines abolished ubiquitination of ARC in response to an apoptotic stimulus (Fig. 5A). Pulse-chase studies demonstrated that the triple lysine mutant exhibited markedly increased protein stability under both basal (Fig. 5B, left) and apoptotic (right) conditions. Finally, steady state levels of the triple lysine mutant protein were maintained even 40 h after induction of apoptosis, at which time wild type ARC protein levels were nearly undetectable (Fig. 5C). In contrast to the triple lysine mutant, all combinations of single or double mutations of these residues did not significantly alter steady state protein levels during apoptosis (not shown). These genetic data demonstrate unambiguously that decreases in ARC levels during apoptosis are mediated by destabilization of the ARC protein via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Degradation-resistant ARC Mutant Confers Improved Cytoprotection—Because the triple lysine ARC mutant protein is resistant to degradation during apoptosis, we tested whether it exhibits improved cytoprotection. Using procaspase-8, apoptosis was induced in HEK293 cell lines stably expressing wild type or triple lysine mutant ARC. Although steady state levels of wild type ARC decreased dramatically during apoptosis, levels of triple lysine mutant ARC were maintained (Fig. 6, upper blot). Although cell death was decreased by wild type ARC as expected, the triple lysine mutant exhibited significantly more protection (Fig. 6, graph). Accompanying this, processing of caspase-8 was decreased more by the triple lysine mutant than by wild type ARC (Fig. 6, middle blot). These data show that inhibition of ARC degradation results in enhanced cytoprotection. This study extends the cellular contexts in which ARC protein levels are known to decrease during apoptosis. These decreases are mediated by destabilization of ARC protein via the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Mutation of its ubiquitin acceptor residues renders ARC resistant to degradation during apoptosis, maintains its steady state levels, and enhances its cytoprotection. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the marked decrease in steady state ARC protein levels during apoptosis is not explained by changes in ARC mRNA abundance. These data suggest that changes in ARC transcription and mRNA stability do not play major roles in regulating ARC protein levels in this context. These results are consistent with measurements in failing human hearts (18Donath S. Li P. Willenbockel C. Al-Saadi N. Gross V. Willnow T. Bader M. Martin U. Bauersachs J. Wollert K.C. Dietz R. von Harsdorf R. Circulation. 2006; 113: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, pulse-chase experiments in several cell types demonstrated marked decreases in ARC protein stability in response to different apoptotic stimuli. The magnitude of these changes suggests that increases in ARC protein degradation play a key role in decreases in steady state ARC protein levels during apoptosis. To determine the mechanism of ARC destabilization during apoptosis, we explored the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. We found that ARC undergoes polyubiquitination during apoptosis. Moreover, mutation of potential ubiquitin acceptor lysines yielded an ARC mutant that, during apoptosis, failed to be ubiquitinated, was resistant to degradation, and maintained steady state levels. These data provide definitive evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway regulates decreases in steady state levels of ARC protein during apoptosis. A related question concerns the identity of the E3 ubiquitin ligase for ARC. As discussed in the accompanying article (28Foo R.S.-Y. Chan L. K.W. Kitsis R.N. Bennett M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5529-5535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), Mdm2 is one such E3 ligase. Using stable transfectants with mild overexpression of ARC, we have previously shown that, even in the setting of falling ARC protein levels during apoptosis, physiological levels inhibit cell death (12Nam Y.J. Mani K. Ashton A.W. Peng C.F. Krishnamurthy B. Hayakawa Y. Lee P. Korsmeyer S.J. Kitsis R.N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These data suggest that maintaining ARC protein abundance at basal levels is sufficient for cell survival. Creation of a degradation-resistant ARC mutant is required to test this hypothesis. The triple lysine ARC mutant maintained ARC protein levels in the face of an apoptotic stimulus, which resulted in significantly more cytoprotection than wild type ARC, whose levels decrease during apoptosis. These data provide direct evidence that decreases in ARC protein abundance are indeed an initiating event in apoptosis. Given this causal connection, it will be important to elucidate the pathways that connect death stimuli with ARC degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2049725192,"APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F are cytidine deaminase with duplicative cytidine deaminase motifs that restrict HIV-1 replication by catalyzing C-to-U transitions on nascent viral cDNA. Despite 60% protein sequence similarity, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G have a different target consensus sequence for editing, and importantly, APOBEC3G has 10-fold higher anti-HIV activity than APOBEC3F. Thus, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G may have distinctive characteristics that account for their functional differences. Here, we have biochemically characterized human APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G protein complexes as a function of the HIV-1 life cycle. APOBEC3G was previously shown to form RNase-sensitive, enzymatically inactive, high molecular mass complexes in immortalized cells, which are converted into enzymatically active, low molecular mass complexes by RNase digestion. We found that APOBEC3F also formed high molecular mass complexes in these cells, but these complexes were resistant to RNase treatment. Further, the N-terminal half determined RNase sensitivity and was necessary for the high molecular mass complex assembly of APOBEC3G but not APOBEC3F. Unlike APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G strongly interacted with cellular proteins via disulfide bonds. Inside virions, both APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G were found in viral cores, but APOBEC3G was associated with low molecular mass, whereas APOBEC3F was still retained in high molecular mass complexes. After cell entry, both APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G were localized in low molecular mass complexes associated with viral reverse transcriptional machinery. These results demonstrate that APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G complexes undergo dynamic conversion during HIV-1 infection and also reveal biochemical differences that likely determine their different anti-HIV-1 activity.

The replication of the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; A1, APOBEC1; A2, APOBEC2; A3, APOBEC3; A4, APOBEC4; HMM, high molecular mass; LMM, low molecular mass; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; A1, APOBEC1; A2, APOBEC2; A3, APOBEC3; A4, APOBEC4; HMM, high molecular mass; LMM, low molecular mass; FPLC, fast performance liquid chromatography; VSV-G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is seriously impaired in human primary lymphocytes if the viral protein Vif is not present. Vif counteracts a series of host factors that belong to the cytidine deaminase family known as APOBEC proteins (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide). This family consists of APOBEC1 (A1); AID (activation-induced deaminase); APOBEC2 (A2); a subgroup of APOBEC3 (A3) including A3A, A3B, A3C, A3DE, A3F, A3G, and A3H; and APOBEC4 (A4) proteins in humans (1Conticello S.G.

All of these proteins contain one or two Zn2+-binding motifs (HXEX23–28PCX2–4C), which could be the cytidine deaminase active sites (5MacGinnitie A.J. Anant S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

For example, A1, AID, A2, A3A, A3C, A3H, and A4 have one cytidine deaminase motif, and A3B, A3DE, A3F, and A3G have two motifs located in their N- or C-terminal domains, respectively. A1 or AID can target cytosines and change them to uracils (C-to-U) on specific RNA or DNA targets resulting in regulation of protein metabolism or immune responses (7Muramatsu M. Sankaranand V.S.

Using a similar mechanism, all A3 proteins except A3H have been found to be able to mutate genomes of various retroviral elements and block their replication (9Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Particularly, A3B, A3DE, A3F, and A3G proteins have been shown to block HIV-1 replication (10Bishop K.N. Holmes R.K.

For A3B, A3F, and A3G, their incorporation into HIV-1 is due to their interactions with Gag proteins in the nucleocapsid region, and this interaction is mediated by cellular or viral genomic RNAs (16Alce T.M.

During this process, A3s deaminate deoxycytidines to form deoxyuridines on the nascent viral cDNAs, resulting in G-to-A mutations in the plus strand DNA and abortive replication (26Harris R.S.

Vif specifically binds to A3DE, A3F, and A3G but not A3B (11Dang Y. Wang X. Esselman W.J. Zheng Y.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10522-10533Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Wiegand H.L.

Yu Y. Liu B. Luo K. Kong W. Mao P. Yu X.F. Science. 2003; 302: 1056-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). SCF belongs to the RING (really interesting new gene) family of E3s, which normally contain RING finger proteins such as Rbx1 (Ring box 1) to recruit E2 ubiquitin ligases. In fact, Vif has a BC-Box motif (Ser144-Leu145-Gln146) that binds to ElonginC (32Mehle A. Goncalves J. Santa-Marta M. McPike M. Gabuzda D.

Thus, Vif is able to bridge the Cul5-based E3 ligase complex to A3DE, A3F, and A3G and trigger their degradation in the 26 S proteasome (15Zheng Y.H. Irwin D. Kurosu T. Tokunaga K. Sata T. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6073-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 30Marin M. Rose K.M. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Nat.

Cell. 2003; 12: 591-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). As a consequence, viral replication is secured because of insufficient A3 protein presence. It was previously shown that A3G resides in two different protein complexes in different cells with distinctive enzymatic activity (40Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In immortalized or activated primary T cells, it resides in >700-kDa high molecular mass (HMM) complexes, whereas in the resting primary T cells, it resides in ∼100 kDa low molecular mass (LMM) complex (40Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The HMM complex contains cellular RNAs and is therefore RNase-sensitive. Upon RNase A treatment, the HMM complex disassembles into the LMM complex. In addition, only the LMM A3G complex exhibits the cytidine deaminase activity in vitro, which suggests that HMM complex may contain an inhibitory protein and/or RNA to prevent A3G from functioning. Whether the other A3 proteins form similar protein complexes and how these complexes are associated with viral life cycle remains unknown. On the other hand, although A3F and A3G share ∼60% protein sequence similarity and block HIV-1 replication by the same mechanism, they can be functionally differentiated. First, they have different target consensus sequences for editing. During cytidine deamination of the viral genome, A3G specifically recognizes deoxythymidines, whereas A3F recognizes deoxycytidines at positions –1 and –2. The C-terminal cytidine deaminase motif determines this target consensus sequence specificity (41Hache G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Second, A3G mutates HIV-1 genome at much higher efficiency than A3F, and indeed, A3G anti-HIV-1 activity is 10-fold higher than A3F (42Bishop K.N. Holmes R.K. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 8450-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The delineation of the biochemical basis of these functional differences is critical to the understanding of the molecular mechanism of regulation of antiretroviral activities. In this report, we biochemically characterized A3F and A3G protein complexes in the HIV-1 life cycle. Using sucrose gradient equilibrium density centrifugation and fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC), we found that although A3F also formed HMM complexes, they were resistant to RNase treatment. Further, A3F and A3G had different determinants for the HMM complex assembly. Interestingly, inside virions, A3G was in the LMM form, whereas A3F was retained in the HMM complex. In addition, unlike A3F, A3G strongly interacted with cellular proteins via disulfide bonds. Taken together, these results uncovered several aspects of the biochemical differences between A3F and A3G, which could contribute to their different antiretroviral activity. Plasmids and Cell Lines—The HIV-1 proviral construct pNL4-3Δvif and pNL-LucΔvif and the mammalian expression vectors for human A3A, A3F, A3G, and A3G-GST fusion were described before (11Dang Y. Wang X. Esselman W.J. Zheng Y.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10522-10533Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A construct expressing A3F-GST fusion was generated similarly as that of A3G-GST. The original constructs expressing chimerical A3F and A3G proteins (A3F+G and A3G+F) were a generous gift from R. S. Harris (41Hache G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), which were subsequently recloned into pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) and ligated to a GST tag. All of these constructs contain a V5 tag to be expressed at the C terminus of the target proteins. In addition, constructs expressing A3F and A3G with a C-terminal tandem HA/FLAG tag were also generated. Eight cytidine deaminase motif mutants A3FHXE1, A3FPCXXC1, A3FHXE2, A3FPCXXC2, A3GHXE1, A3GPCXXC1, A3GHXE2, and A3GPCXXC2 were generated by the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 293 cell lines stably expressing A3F and A3G were described before (11Dang Y. Wang X. Esselman W.J. Zheng Y.H. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 10522-10533Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Viral Production—HIV-1 virions were produced from 293T cells by the standard calcium phosphate transfection. Typically, 20 μg of total plasmid DNA was used for each transfection in a 100-mm culture dish with 40% confluence of the cell. The ratio between the proviral construct and A3G expression vectors were kept at 1:1. In some cases, HIV-1 was pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) protein by co-transfection of 5 μg of VSV-G expression vector. The production of HIV-1 was quantified by p24Gag capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HIV-1 viruses were then used to infect GHOST-R3/X4/R5 cells. Isolation of HMM and LMM Complex by Equilibrium Density Centrifugation and FPLC—293 cells expressing various A3 proteins were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1× Sigma protease inhibitor mixture, 10 mm NaF, 0.25 mm NaOVO3, 5 nm okadaic acid, 5 nm calyculin A, and 50 mm β-glycerophosphate. After removing the nuclei, the cytosolic fraction was loaded on top of the 4–40% sucrose gradient in a tube of Beckman SW-41 rotor and spun for 6 h at 41,000 rpm. Typically, 12 fractions were collected from each tube. The proteins were then precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by Western blot. In addition, high density A3F and A3G complexes were subject to FPLC apparatus using a calibrated HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column. To purify HIV-1 virions, virions were first concentrated from filtered culture medium of 293T cells transfected with HIV proviral construct by spinning through 20% sucrose cushion in tubes of the Beckman SW-28 rotor at 28,000 rpm for 1 h. Virions were resuspended in STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), loaded on a linear 16–65% sucrose gradient, and spun at 100,000 × g for 16 h in a tube of Beckman SW-41 rotor. Twelve fractions were collected from each tube, and virions were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid, and viral proteins were analyzed by Western blot. To purify viral core, viral pellets were loaded on the top of a 1% Triton X-100 layer followed by a 16–65% sucrose gradient as described before (43Kotov A. Zhou J. Flicker P. Aiken C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8824-8830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and spun at the same condition as viral purification. To determine A3G or A3F protein complex in HIV-1 virion, complete viral lysates were prepared by incubating viral pellets with 1% Triton X-100 at 37 °C for 3.5 h. Viral lysates were then loaded on the 16–65% sucrose gradient and spun at the same conditions as viral purification. The fractions were collected and analyzed similarly. A simplified schematic description for this protocol was presented in Fig. 5. Scintillation Proximity Assay for Cytidine Deamination—As described previously (24Svarovskaia E.S. Xu H. Mbisa J.L. Barr R. Gorelick R.J. Ono A. Freed E.O. Hu W.S. Pathak V.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35822-35828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a biotinylated primer (5′-biotin-gtcagcatcctgaattctacc-3′) was annealed to a deoxyoligonucleotide template containing ten 5′-ccca-3′ repeats and a complementary sequence for the biotinylated primer (5′-cccacccacccacccacccacccacccacccacccacccaggtagaattcaggatgctgac-3′). This hybrid was then immobilized on streptavidin-polyvinyltoluene scintillation proximity assay beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with the A3G proteins in a total volume of 64 μl with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.05% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 2 h. Then the polymerization reaction was performed by adding 0.04 mm mixture of dTTP and dGTP, 0.25 μCi of [3H]dATP (Amersham Biosciences), and 0.02 unit of Klenow fragment (Roche Applied Science) for another 40 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 120 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The entire reaction product was then transferred to a scintillation tube with 3 ml of TBE buffer and determined by the LS 6000TA scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). As a positive control, a parallel experiment was performed using a similar template where the ten 5′-ccca-3′ repeats were replaced by ten 5′-uuua-3′ repeats, and the resulting incorporation of [3H]dATP into this template was referred to as 100% deamination activity. The results were shown as relative values to this positive control. Interaction of A3F and A3G with Other Proteins via Disulfide Bonds—293T cells were either transfected with an A3-GST construct alone or co-transfected with an A3 nonfusion construct. After 48 h, the cells were lysed. Cytosolic fractions were incubated with GSH-Sepharose beads, and bound proteins were eluted with 1 mm glutathione (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline. Eluted samples were treated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (Pierce) at 8 mm final concentration for 2 h at room temperature. After separation by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the samples were detected by Western blot using anti-V5 or FLAG antibodies. Western Blot—Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 or FLAG antibodies (Invitrogen) were used to directly detect the expression of A3s or their GST fusions. HIV-1 p17MA, p24Gag, and p32IN were detected by antibodies from National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG secondary antibodies were obtained commercially (Pierce). Detection of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences Bioscience). Comparison of A3F and A3G Protein Complexes in Cells—As noted above, A3G forms a RNase-sensitive, enzymatically inactive HMM complex in immortalized cells. Because the formation of this complex regulates the function of A3G, we wished to determine whether A3F is also subject to similar modulation. Previously, A3G HMM and LMM complexes were isolated by FPLC (40Chiu Y.L. Soros V.B. Kreisberg J.F. Stopak K. Yonemoto W. Greene W.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). To further maximize for the yield in the isolation, which is particularly important for detection of A3 proteins inside HIV-1 virions (see below), we employed equilibrium density centrifugation to segregate A3G protein complexes. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from 293 cells stably expressing human A3G and subjected to 4–40% sucrose velocity gradient ultracentrifugation. As shown in Fig. 1A, A3G was solely found in high density fractions (including fractions 7–12). In contrast, human A3A was only found in low density fractions (fractions 3 and 4). In addition, preincubation of cell lysates with RNase A resulted in a shift of A3G from high to the low density fractions. These results indicate that the A3G found in the high density fractions could be the A3G HMM complexes and that A3G in the low density fractions could be the A3G LMM complexes. To further confirm this, A3G complexes in different densities were subject to FPLC analysis. As presented in Fig. 1B, the molecular mass of A3G in high density fractions (A3Ghigh density) was higher than 700 kDa, and most of the A3G in the low density fractions (A3Glow density) was lower than 160 kDa. We further compared the deaminase activity of A3G found in these low and high density fractions (Fig. 1C). As controls, total cell lysates of 293 cells without A3G expression did not exhibit any activity (lane 1). Cell lysates of 293 cells expressing A3G exhibited marginal deaminase activity (lane 2), and treatment with RNase A resulted in a 5-fold increase in activity (lane 3). As expected, A3G in the high density fraction exhibited limited deaminase activity, which was only comparable with that of RNase-treated total cell lysates (lane 4), and A3G in the low density fraction exhibited at least 10-fold higher activity than that in this high density fraction (lane 5). Thus, we concluded that the density centrifugation-isolated high density A3G complexes are indeed A3G HHM complexes, and those in the low density fractions are LMM complexes. Next, we examined A3F protein complexes. A cytosolic fraction from 293 cells stably expressing human A3F was prepared and subjected to equilibrium density centrifugation. A3F was found in high density fractions 9–12 (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Surprisingly, RNase A treatment only partially shifted A3F from high density to lower density (fraction 5) and resulted in a rather broad distribution in the gradient fractions. Next, we determined the molecular mass of A3F in these fractions (Fig. 1B lower two panels). The molecular mass of A3F in the high density fractions (A3Fhigh density) was higher than 700 kDa, and most of the RNase A-treated A3F fractions (A3Flow density) remained around 700 kDa. Thus, we concluded that A3F also resides in the HMM complex in 293 cells, and unlike A3G the A3F HMM complex is insensitive to RNase treatment. Mapping the Determinants for A3 HMM Complex RNase Sensitivity—Having discovered that there is a difference in RNase sensitivity between A3F and A3G HMM complexes, we next mapped the determinant for this difference. Because both A3F and A3G have duplicative cytidine deaminase motifs, we took advantage of published constructs expressing chimerical proteins in which the N- and C-terminal halves of A3F were swapped for those of A3G, respectively (41Hache G. Liddament M.T. Harris R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10920-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A3F+G chimerical protein expresses the N-terminal half of A3F and C-terminal half of A3G, and A3G+F chimerical protein expresses the N-terminal half of A3G and C-terminal half of A3F (Fig. 2A). The chimerical proteins were expressed in 293T cells, and the protein-associated complexes were prepared using equilibrium density centrifugation as above. Like the wild type A3F and A3G, both A3F+G and A3G+F were able to assemble HMM complexes (Fig. 2B). However, the complexes fell into a broader range of density as compared with those of wild type A3F or A3G proteins. Interestingly, when these HMM complexes were treated with RNase A, only those of A3G and A3G+F, but not A3F and A3F+G, were sensitive to the treatment. These results indicate that the N-terminal half of A3F and A3G proteins determines their HMM complex RNase sensitivity. Mapping the Determinants for A3F and A3G HMM Complex Assembly—Having demonstrated that both A3F and A3G can assemble HMM complexes in cells, we next investigated the sequence determinant for this assembly. It has been reported that the N-terminal cytidine deaminase motif has much higher RNA affinity than the C-terminal cytidine deaminase motif (44Navarro F. Bollman B. Chen H. Konig R. Yu Q. Chiles K. Landau N.R. Virology. 2005; 333: 374-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Because A3G HMM complexes contain cellular RNA, we decided to mutate the N-terminal cytidine deaminase motif of both A3F and A3G by generating two kinds of mutants, HXE1 and PCXXC1, where the first HXE and PCXXC motifs were changed to AXS and LSXXS, respectively. As controls, we also mutated the C-terminal cytidine deaminase motif of both A3F and A3G by generating mutants of HXE2 and PCXXC2 where the second HXE and PCXXC motifs were changed to AXS and LSXXS, respectively (Fig. 3A). As presented in Fig. 3B, all of these mutants proteins were expressed at similar levels to their wild type proteins, and these mutations seriously disrupted A3F or A3G anti-HIV-1 activities, although the ability of A3FPCXXC2 was less compromised, proving the success of the introduction of these mutations. We then determined the influence of these mutations on A3G HMM complex formation. These mutant proteins were expressed in 293T cells, and protein complexes were prepared as above. When compared with the wild type A3G, both A3GHXE1 and A3GPCXXC1 lost their ability to assemble the HMM complexes, whereas both A3GHXE2 and A3GPCXXC2 still retained such ability (as presented in Fig. 3C). Interestingly, none of these mutations in A3F (A3FHXE1, A3FPCXXC1, A3FHXE2, and A3FPCXXC2) had any impact on the assembly of A3F HMM complex (Fig. 3D). Thus, we concluded that: 1) the N-terminal cytidine deaminase motif of A3G determines its ability to assemble the HMM complex and 2) none of A3F cytidine deaminase motifs is responsible for its HMM complex assembly. A3G Interacts with Other Cellular Proteins via Disulfide Bonds—Differential HMM complex RNase sensitivity and assembly between A3F and A3G suggests the existence of a remarkable biochemical difference between these two proteins, which stim"
https://openalex.org/W1988049420,"Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK, KCa) are a family of voltage-independent K+ channels with a distinct physiology and pharmacology. The bee venom toxin apamin inhibits exclusively the three cloned SK channel subtypes (SK1, SK2, and SK3) with different affinity, highest for SK2, lowest for SK1, and intermediate for SK3 channels. The high selectivity of apamin made it a valuable tool to study the molecular makeup and function of native SK channels. Three amino acids located in the outer vestibule of the pore are of particular importance for the different apamin sensitivities of SK channels. Chimeric SK1 channels, enabling the homomeric expression of the rat SK1 (rSK1) subunit and containing the core domain (S1–S6) of rSK1, are apamin-insensitive. By contrast, channels formed by the human orthologue human SK1 (hSK1) are sensitive to apamin. This finding hinted at the involvement of regions beyond the pore as determinants of apamin sensitivity, because hSK1 and rSK1 have an identical amino acid sequence in the pore region. Here we investigated which parts of the channels outside the pore region are important for apamin sensitivity by constructing chimeras between apamin-insensitive and -sensitive SK channel subunits and by introducing point mutations. We demonstrate that a single amino acid situated in the extracellular loop between the transmembrane segments S3 and S4 has a major impact on apamin sensitivity. Our findings enabled us to convert the hSK1 channel into a channel that was as sensitive for apamin as SK2, the SK channel with the highest sensitivity.

Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) 3The abbreviations used are: KCa,Ca2+-activated potassium channel; CI, confidence interval; HEK293 cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; SK, small conductance Ca2+-activated potassium channel; rSK, rat SK1; TEA, tetraethylammonium; hSK1, human SK1. are activated by rises in intracellular Ca2+. The KCa potassium channel family includes at least three subfamilies, KCa1–3 (1Wei A.D. Gutman G.A. Aldrich R. Chandy K.G. Grissmer S. Wulff H. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Channels containing the KCa1.1 α-subunit (BK channels) have large single channel conductance and are maximally activated by micromolar concentrations of intracellular free calcium and concurrent depolarization (2Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 143-147Google Scholar). Their kinetic and pharmacological properties are modified upon assembly with membrane standing β-subunits (3Orio P. Rojas P. Ferreira G. Latorre R. News Physiol. Sci. 2002; 17: 156-161PubMed Google Scholar). The KCa2 subfamily of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels, also known as SK channels, has three closely related members SK1 (KCa2.1), SK2 (KCa2.2), and SK3 (KCa2.3), which are characterized by a small single channel conductance. The IK channel (KCa3.1) shows an intermediate single channel conductance. Both SK and IK channels are voltage-independent and activated by submicromolar concentrations of intracellular free Ca2+. The gating of SK and IK channels is induced upon Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, which is constitutively bound to each channel subunit. Ca2+ binding to calmodulin induces a conformational change, which leads to the opening of these channels (4Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G.

The rat SK1 (rSK1) subunits, unlike the human SK1 (hSK1), do not form functional homomeric SK channels (41Benton D.C. Monaghan A.S. Hosseini R. Bahia P.K. Haylett D.G. Moss G.W. J. Physiol.

The construction of chimeric rSK1 channels, including the amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal regions of rSK2 or hSK1, enabled the expression of homomeric rSK1-like channels displaying more than a 25-fold reduction in apamin sensitivity compared with hSK1 (42D'Hoedt D. Hirzel K. Pedarzani P. Stocker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12088-12092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This finding was rather surprising, as hSK1 and rSK1 share an identical primary sequence within the pore region, where three amino acids have been identified as determinants of the apamin sensitivity (43Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In this study, to test the hypothesis that amino acids outside the pore region contribute to apamin binding, chimera were generated to identify new regions in the SK channels involved in determining sensitivity to apamin. The introduction of point mutations and their analysis revealed the existence of an amino acid beyond the pore region that crucially influences SK channel sensitivity for apamin. This finding provides a new insight into the molecular determinants for the apamin receptor and extends our understanding of how the difference in sensitivity of the different SK channel subunits is generated. Furthermore, to our knowledge this is the first description of a toxin that inhibits potassium channels by interacting simultaneously with amino acids inside and outside the pore region. A detailed understanding of the structural basis of the differences in the pharmacological profile of SK channel subtypes is essential for the rational development of subunit-specific inhibitors. DNA Constructs—The coding regions of hSK1, rSK1, and rSK2 (GenBank™ accession numbers NM_002248, NM_019313, and NM_019314) were cloned into pcDNA3 or pcDNA5/FRT (40Pedarzani P. D'Hoedt D. Doorty K.B.

The range of amino acids combined is given in plain numbers for residues corresponding to rSK1, boldface numbers for residues corresponding to hSK1, and underlined numbers for residues corresponding to rSK2. The chimera rSK1NSK2-CSK2 contains the transmembrane domains and the pore of rSK1 and the NH2 and COOH termini of rSK2. The generation of this chimera (1–121/89–372/406–580) has been described previously (42D'Hoedt D. Hirzel K. Pedarzani P. Stocker M. J. Biol.

L1-hSK1 (1–121/89–120/125–143/140–372/406–580) was generated by substituting the extracellular region between transmembrane segments S1 and S2 in rSK1NSK2-CSK2 for the corresponding region in hSK1. In L3-hSK1 (1–121/89–200/205–227/224–372/406–580) the extracellular region between transmembrane segments S3 and S4 of rSK1NSK2-CSK2 was exchanged for the corresponding region of hSK1. Finally, chimera hSK1-SK2-hSK1 (1–122/152–256/228–543) was created by exchanging the region from the end of transmembrane segment S1 until the beginning of transmembrane segment S4 of hSK1 for the corresponding region in rSK2.

Maintenance and Transient Transfection of HEK293 and Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells—Cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air) at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 2 mm l-glutamine. Chinese hamster ovary cell lines were grown in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham) with GlutaMAX™ I. Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfections cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 2 μg of plasmid DNA encoding one of the SK channel constructs was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pEGFP-C2. Recordings were performed 1–3 days after transfection. Generation and Maintenance of Cell Lines Stably Expressing SK Channels—For SK channel constructs hSK1-T216S, hSK1, and hSK1(QDN+S), stable cell lines were generated. Constructs were cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT vector. HEK Flp-In cells (Invitrogen) were grown under the same conditions as HEK293 but in the presence of Zeocin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 or by CaPO4 precipitation. For Lipofectamine 2000 transfection, cells were plated into 60-mm culture dishes and co-transfected with a mixture of 0.7 μg of expression construct and 7.3 μg of pOG44 plasmid according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the CaPO4 precipitation method, cells were plated into 90-mm culture dishes and co-transfected with a mixture of 2 μg of expression construct and 23 μg of pOG44 plasmid. For polyclonal selection of cells, Zeocin was replaced by hygromycin B (75 μg/ml). Hygromycin-resistant cells were pooled and maintained in the presence of hygromycin B. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of HEK cells transiently transfected or stably expressing SK channel constructs were performed. Transfected cells were grown on coverslips, placed in a recording chamber, and perfused at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Currents were recorded using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). All recordings were performed at room temperature (22 °C). Data were acquired with Pulse/Pulsefit software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass with a horizontal patch electrode puller (Zeitz Instruments GmbH, Muenchen, Germany) and had a resistance of 1.8–3 megohms when filled with intracellular solution (see below). After gigaseal formation, the fast capacitative transients were automatically compensated. SK channels were activated by whole-cell dialysis with an intracellular solution containing (in mm) the following: 130 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, pH 7.2. MgCl2 and CaCl2 were added to obtain free magnesium and calcium concentrations of 1 mm and 1 μm, respectively, using EqCal (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Recordings were performed in a high potassium extracellular solution containing (in mm) the following: 144 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.4, with KOH, or a low potassium extracellular solution containing (in mm) the following: 4 KCl, 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 d-glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. The high potassium solution was used in most experiments, and inward currents were analyzed in order to avoid problems because of SK channel rectification and activation of endogenous voltage-gated K+ channels at positive potentials. In tetraethylammonium (TEA)-containing solutions, TEA-Cl replaced NaCl in the low potassium extracellular solution. Membrane currents were recorded upon application of 400-ms voltage ramps from –140 to +40 mV and repeated every 10 s. Given the large size of some currents, voltages were corrected off-line for the occurring voltage-clamp error. Cells that showed >20% residual current after application of 100 nm apamin were excluded from the analysis. Concentration-response curves were analyzed using a Langmuir-Hill equation of the type I/Imax = (1 – a0)/(1 + ([inhibitor]/IC50)h) + a0, where h corresponds to the Hill coefficient and IC50 to the concentration of inhibitor that produces a 50% inhibition. The value for curve minimum (a0) was not fixed. The data points for the concentration-response curves were obtained from different cells and therefore treated as independent replicates. The fraction of unblocked current (I/Imax) was calculated at –80 or –20 mV. Curve fitting was performed by using a least square fitting routine. All data were analyzed with Igor Pro 5.0 (Wave-Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR) or Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego). Values are given as mean ± S.E. or 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Unpaired two-tailed Student's t test was used for statistical comparisons between groups. Amino Acids Outside the Pore Affect Apamin Sensitivity— The three members of the SK channel family, SK1, SK2, and SK3, can be distinguished by their sensitivity to apamin. Homomeric SK2 channels from rat (rSK2), mouse (mSK2), and human (hSK2) are the most apamin-sensitive, and homomeric hSK1 channels are the least sensitive channels of the KCa2 subfamily (21Stocker M.

In heterologous expression systems, the rSK1 α-subunit does not form functional homomeric channels (41Benton D.C. Monaghan A.S. Hosseini R. Bahia P.K. Haylett D.G. Moss G.W. J. Physiol.

Haylett D.G. Moss G.W. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 553: 13-19Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The chimeric rSK1 α-subunit (rSK1NSK2-CSK2), which contains the S1–S6 region of rSK1 with amino and carboxyl termini of rSK2, assembles into homomers (42D'Hoedt D. Hirzel K. Pedarzani P. Stocker M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12088-12092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This chimera is ideally suited to obtain information on the pharmacological properties of the rSK1 subunit. The hSK1 channel and the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. In solutions with nearly identical intra- and extracellular potassium concentrations, a calcium-activated potassium current was elicited by voltage ramps ranging from –140 to +40 mV in the presence of 1 μm intracellular free calcium. The observed current showed a reversal potential close to 0 mV and was shifted to hyperpolarized values upon lowering the extracellular potassium concentration to 4 mm (Fig. 1A). As expected the observed reversal potentials corresponded to values predicted by the Nernst equation for a potassium conductance. The primary sequence of the hSK1 α-subunit and the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera is identical between transmembrane segments S5 and S6. This region includes the pore of potassium channels and has been ascribed the structural basis for the different apamin sensitivities of members of the KCa2 family (43Ishii T.M. Maylie J. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23195-23200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, the current generated by the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera was not inhibited by 5 nm apamin (Fig. 1A), whereas 3 nm apamin inhibited hSK1 by nearly 50% (Fig. 1B; 42 ± 1%, n = 6). The identical pore regions of hSK1 and rSK1NSK2-CSK2 and the observed intriguing difference in apamin sensitivity (Fig. 1, A and B) strongly suggest the involvement of amino acids located outside the pore domain for apamin binding. The most obvious regions potentially harboring these amino acids are the hydrophilic extracellular loop L1, located between transmembrane segments S1 and S2, and L3, located between transmembrane segments S3 and S4. Two chimera, L1-hSK1 and L3-hSK1, were created to analyze these regions. L1-hSK1 was generated by substituting the extracellular loop between the transmembrane segments S1 and S2 in rSK1NSK2-CSK2 with the corresponding region of hSK1. In L3-hSK1 the extracellular loop between S3 and S4 (S3–S4 loop) of rSK1NSK2-CSK2 was exchanged for the corresponding region of hSK1. The chimera were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and currents were elicited as described above. Both chimera assembled into functional homomeric channels (Fig. 1, C and D). L1-hSK1 showed, like rSK1NSK2-CSK2, only a marginal inhibition upon application of 5 nm apamin (1 ± 1%, n = 4; Fig. 1C). In contrast, 5 nm apamin suppressed around 50% of the current generated by L3-hSK1 (44 ± 5%, n = 5; Fig. 1D), thereby demonstrating an apamin sensitivity similar to hSK1. These results show that the extracellular S3–S4 loop (L3) influences apamin sensitivity and is most likely sufficient to explain the observed difference in apamin sensitivity between hSK1 and rSK1. The Hydrophilic Extracellular Loop L3 between Transmembrane Segments S3 and S4 Influences Apamin Binding—Because amino acids located outside the pore influence the apamin sensitivity of the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera (Fig. 1, A–D), we wondered whether it is a general feature of SK channels that regions outside the pore influence their sensitivity toward apamin. To address this question, we generated a chimera between hSK1 and SK2, which differ more than 100-fold in apamin sensitivity (46Shah M. Haylett D.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 47Strobaek D. Jorgensen T.D. Christophersen P. Ahring P.K. Olesen S.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this chimera, hSK1-SK2-hSK1, the region from the end of the transmembrane segment S1 until the beginning of the transmembrane segment S4 of hSK1, was exchanged for the corresponding region of SK2 (Fig. 2A). If only amino acids in the pore region (between S5 and S6) are responsible for the apamin sensitivity of SK channels, the hSK1-SK2-hSK1 chimera should display an apamin sensitivity comparable with hSK1. If, however, amino acids outside the pore region influence the apamin sensitivity, hSK1-SK2-hSK1 should show an increased sensitivity when compared with hSK1. To test these predictions, hSK1-SK2-hSK1 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells and calcium-activated potassium currents were elicited as described earlier (see also “Material and Methods”). Apamin at a concentration of 300 pm was applied and suppressed the current generated by the hSK1-SK2-hSK1 chimera by more than 50% (Fig. 2, A and D; 58 ± 3%, n = 5). The concentration of 300 pm apamin was used because it does not affect hSK1 (Fig. 2, B and D) but inhibits SK2 channels nearly completely (Fig. 2, C and D). The IC50 value obtained for the hSK1-SK2-hSK1 chimera (Fig. 2E) is 124 pm (95% CI, 100–156 pm). The clear inhibition of the hSK1-SK2-hSK1 current by low concentrations of apamin shows that the exchanged region contributes to the difference in apamin sensitivity between hSK1 and SK2, and thereby supports the hypothesis that amino acids located beyond the pore region influence the apamin sensitivity in SK channels in general. The observations made for the L1-hSK1 and L3-hSK1 constructs were therefore not an oddity only observed within the rSK1NSK2-CSK2 chimera. Next we were interested in identifying the amino acids located outside the pore region that influence the apamin sensitivity. Once more, we used chimeras of SK2 and hSK1, the most and the least apamin-sensitive SK channel subunits, respectively. Based on the observations made with the chimeric SK channels (Fig. 1D and Fig. 2A), we decided to focus on differences in the amino acid sequences of hSK1 and SK2 in the hydrophilic extracellular loop L3 (Fig. 3A). The alignment shows differences between the amino acid sequences of hSK1 and SK2 in eight positions. By introducing single or double point mutations, the amino acids differing at these eight positions in hSK1 were replaced by the corresponding amino acids found in SK2. Consequently, if any of these amino acids influence the apamin sensitivity in SK2, the corresponding hSK1 mutant should show a higher sensitivity for apamin when co"

In this work we demonstrate that Ypi1 forms a complex with Glc7 and Sds22, another Glc7 regulatory subunit that targets the phosphatase to substrates involved in cell cycle control. Interestingly, the combination of equimolar amounts of Ypi1 and Sds22 leads to an almost full inhibition of Glc7 activity. Because YPI1 is an essential gene, we have constructed conditional mutants that demonstrate that depletion of Ypi1 leads to alteration of nuclear localization of Glc7 and cell growth arrest in mid-mitosis with aberrant mitotic spindle. These phenotypes mimic those produced upon inactivation of Sds22. The fact that progressive depletion of either Ypi1 or Sds22 resulted in similar physiological phenotypes and that both proteins inhibit the phosphatase activity of Glc7 strongly suggest a common role of these two proteins in regulating Glc7 nuclear localization and function.

PP1 (protein Ser/Thr phosphatase-1) is a ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme that regulates a variety of cellular processes, such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression (for review see Refs. 1Aggen J.B.

Protein Phosphatases: Topics in Current Genetics. Vol. 5. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg2004: 21-44Google Scholar). The PP1 catalytic subunit is highly conserved throughout evolution. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is only one PP1, named Glc7, which is essential for cell viability (5Clotet J. Posas F. Casamayor A. Schaaff-Gerstenschlager I. Arino J. Curr.

Similarly to its mammalian counterpart, Glc7 participates in the regulation of many different physiological processes, such as glycogen metabolism, glucose repression, ion homeostasis, cell cycle regulation, sporulation, vacuole fusion, endocytosis, polyadenylation termination, and the maintenance of cell wall integrity (7Cannon J.

The functional versatility of PP1 is achieved by the existence of numerous regulatory subunits that target PP1 to different subcellular compartments and/or substrates, confer substrate specificity, and/or modulate enzymatic activity (1Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol.

These subunits are structurally diverse, but almost all of them contain a consensus binding motif (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) necessary for PP1 regulation, which also accounts for the mutually exclusive binding of the different subunits to PP1 (1Aggen J.B.

PP1 activity is essential, but it must be tightly controlled as overexpression or hyperactivation of PP1 phosphatase is deleterious to the cell. Consequently, a large number of physiological inhibitors of PP1 have been identified in higher eukaryotes (1Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bollen M. Trends Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16952-16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We have recently identified the first inhibitory subunit of Glc7 in budding yeast. It is a small (155 amino acids), hydrophilic, heat-stable protein that we named Ypi1 (Yeast Phosphatase Inhibitor 1). This protein contains the typical consensus binding motif (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) necessary to bind PP1. Deletion of YPI1 is lethal, suggesting a relevant role of the inhibitor in yeast physiology. On the other hand, overexpression of Ypi1 displays a number of phenotypes consistent with an inhibitory role of this protein on Glc7 activity. Structural homologues of Ypi1 can be found in yeast, plants, and animals, suggesting a strongly conserved function of this protein (19Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide evidence that Ypi1 interacts with Sds22, another regulatory subunit of Glc7 that targets the phosphatase to substrates involved in mitosis and chromosome segregation (20Hisamoto N. Frederick D.L. Sugimoto K. Tatchell K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3767-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Hong G. Trumbly R.J. Reimann E.M. Schlender K.K. Arch. Biochem.

Biol. 1993; 3: 13-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sds22 lacks the consensus (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) recognition motif found in other Glc7 regulatory subunits (15Egloff M.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, interaction between the human orthologue of Sds22 and PP1 is mediated by the 11 leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 3The abbreviations used are: LRR, leucine-rich repeats; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin epitope; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RT, reverse transcription. that Sds22 has in its central domain and occurs at a site in PP1 different from the one used to bind the (R/K)(V/I)X(F/W) motif (24Ceulemans H. Vulsteke V. De Maeyer M. Tatchell K. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47331-47337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In yeast, Sds22 is an essential protein of 40 kDa largely found in the nucleus, despite the absence of a clear nuclear localization sequence (NLS). In addition to its role in mitosis, Sds22 plays a role in maintaining the normal nuclear localization of Glc7 (25Peggie M.W. MacKelvie S.H. Bloecher A. Knatko E.V. Tatchell K. Stark M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 195-206PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we show that Ypi1 and Sds22 form a complex with Glc7, and present data suggesting that, similarly to Sds22, Ypi1 may function within the nucleus, regulating cell growth and also maintaining the nuclear localization of Glc7. The fact that Glc7, Ypi1, and Sds22 are proteins conserved among all eukaryotes suggests that the proposed model of regulation might be also conserved. Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the recipient cell for all plasmids and constructs, whereas E. coli BL21 (DE3) codon plus-RIL (Stratagene) was used to produce recombinant proteins. S. cerevisiae strains used in this work are described in Table 1. Strain MMR09-4, in which the expression of YPI1 is under the control of the tetO7 promoter, was constructed as follows. A PCR-amplified KanMX4-tetO7 cassette was made with oligonucleotides 5′TETO-YPI1 and 3′TETO-YPI1 (Table 2); this cassette was inserted immediately upstream from the initiating ATG codon of the chromosomal YPI1 coding region by homologous recombination in the CML476 strain.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceFY250MATα his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 trp1Δ63 ura3-52F.

A 2.7-kbp DNA fragment containing the entire GLC7-yEmCitrine::SpHis5MX cassette, flanked by 206 nucleotides upstream from the GLC7 start codon and 209 nucleotides immediately downstream from the GLC7 stop codon, was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA from the KT2422 strain using Glc7-1256 and Glc7-1673 oligonucleotides (Table 2) as primers. This fragment was integrated in the genome of the MMR09-4 strain by homologous recombination to generate the MMR11-1 strain. The indicated GLC7-yEmCitrine cassette was also introduced in the strain SAY302 (sds22-5ts) to yield strain MMR13-4. Standard methods for genetic analysis and transformation were used. Yeast cultures were grown in rich medium (YPD) or synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking appropriate supplements to maintain selection for plasmids (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics, A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar), containing the indicated carbon sources. Oligonucleotides used in the present study are described in Table 2. Cells from 20 ml of yeast culture (MMR09-4 strain) were used for each time point after doxycycline or mock treatments. Yeast cells were collected at 4 °C and washed in cold water, and the dried cell pellets kept at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted using the RiboPure-Yeast kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, and the RNA quantification was carried out in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf). 1 μg of RNA was used to generate cDNA with the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using the RT_YPI1_UP and RT_YPI1_DO oligonucleotides (Table 2). 24 cycles of PCR were performed. Yeast expression plasmids pWS-GST-Ypi1 (GST-Ypi1), pWS-Ypi1 (HA-Ypi1), pBTM-Ypi1 (LexA-Ypi1), pBTM-Ypi1W53A (LexA-Ypi1W53A), and pACT2-Ypi1 (GAD-Ypi1) and bacterial plasmids pGEX-Ypi1 (GST-Ypi1) and pUC-Ypi1 were described previously (19Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I.

Plasmids pBTM-Ypi1-Nterm (LexA-Ypi1-(1-93)) and pBTM-Ypi1-Cterm (LexA-Ypi1-(97-155)) were constructed in the following way: plasmid pBTM-Ypi1 was digested with EcoRI/BamHI and then the fragment subcloned into pBTM116 to obtain plasmid pBTM-Ypi1-Nterm, or digested with BamHI/SalI and the fragment subcloned into pUC18, resulting in plasmid pUC-Ypi1-Cterm, and then an EcoRI/SalI fragment from the latter was subcloned into pBTM116 to obtain plasmid pBTM-Ypi1-Cterm. Plasmid pADH1-Ypi1-GFP was obtained in several steps. First we amplified by PCR the coding region of YPI1 using oligonucleotides YFR-1 and Ypi1-GFP, and FY250 genomic DNA as template. The amplified fragment was digested with EcoRI/NotI and subcloned in vector pRS426 (27Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar) to obtain plasmid pRS426-Ypi1. A NotI fragment obtained from plasmid pSF-GFP (28Kim J. Hirsch J.P. Genetics. 1998; 149: 795-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in-frame into the NotI site of pRS426-Ypi1 to obtain plasmid pRS426-Ypi1-GFP. Finally, a SalI/EcoRI fragment containing the ADH1 promoter was subcloned into the latter plasmid to obtain pADH1-Ypi1-GFP. All Ypi1 fusion proteins were fully functional as deduced by rescue of the lethal phenotype of an ypi1::KanMX mutant (strain MMR18; data not shown). SDS22 coding region was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides SDS22-1 and SDS22-2 (see Table 2) using FY250 genomic DNA as template. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI/SalI and subcloned into vectors pBTM116 (29Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) pWS93 (30Song W. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5757-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and pWS-GST (31Mayordomo I. Sanz P. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to obtain the yeast expression plasmids pBTM-Sds22 (LexA-Sds22), pWS-Sds22 (HA-Sds22), and pWS-GST-Sds22 (GST-Sds22), respectively. Using the following combination of oligonucleotides, SDS22Δ41/SDS22-2, SDS22-1/SDS22Δ316, and SDS22Δ41/SDS22Δ316 (Table 2), we amplified truncated forms of Sds22 lacking either an N-terminal fragment (from amino acids 1-40), a C-terminal fragment (from amino acids 316-338), or both. Using oligonucleotides SDS22LRRcap/SDS22-2, we also amplified the LRR-cap domain (from amino acids 316-338) of Sds22. These fragments were digested with BamHI/SalI and subcloned into vector pBTM116 to obtain plasmids pBTM-Sds22Δ41, pBTM-Sds22Δ316, pBTM-Sds22Δ41Δ316, and pBTM-Sds22LRRcap respectively, which expressed LexA-Sds22(41-338), LexA-Sds22(1-315), LexA-Sds22(41-315), and LexA-Sds22(316-338) fusion proteins (in parentheses are the amino acid sequences being expressed). Plasmid pGEX-Glc7 (GST-Glc7) was described in Ref. 32Tung H.Y. Wang W. Chan C.S. Mol. Cell.

Two mg of yeast crude extract from cells expressing HA-Ypi1 (plasmid pWS-Ypi1), HA-Glc7 (plasmid YEpACT-Glc7), and LexA-Sds22 (plasmid pBTM-Sds22) was loaded to a calibrated FPLC Superdex 200 HR 10/30 gel filtration column previously equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Aliquots of 300 μl were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-LexA and anti-HA antibodies (see below). Preparation of yeast protein extracts for co-immunoprecipitation assays was essentially as described previously (35Sanz P. Alms G.R. Haystead T.A. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Extraction buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol and contained 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and a complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Yeast extracts (500 μg) were incubated with either 1 μl of anti-LexA polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen), 1μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or 1μl of anti-GST polyclonal antibody (Amersham Biosciences), and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4°C and then washed four times with extraction buffer. Proteins retained by the affinity system were detected by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot using anti-HA monoclonal, anti-LexA polyclonal, and anti-GST polyclonal antibodies and chemiluminescence reagents (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Purification of the fusion protein GST-Ypi1 expressed in E. coli was carried out as described previously (36Zhang A.J. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached a value of around 0.3. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cultures were grown overnight at 25 °C. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified by passing the extracts through a 1-ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins were eluted from the column with 10 mm glutathione. Samples were stored at -80 °C. Bacterial expression and purification of GST-Glc7 fusion protein were described previously (19Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). GST-Sds22 fusion protein was expressed in yeast and purified as above. To evaluate the effect of depletion of Ypi1 in cell growth, wild type CML476 and the conditional tetO:YPI1 mutant (MMR09-4) were grown overnight in YPD, diluted at A600 of 0.01, and treated with 100 μg/ml doxycycline (or vehicle), and growth was resumed for 12 h at 30 °C. The culture was diluted again until an A600 of 0.01 and again received 100 μg/ml doxycycline before growth was resumed. Samples were taken at the indicated intervals, and the A600 of the culture measured. The doxycycline treatment was renewed every 12 h to account for possible degradation of the drug. To check which step of the cell cycle the Ypi1-depleted cells were arrested, cultures (15 ml) of the MMR09-4 strain in YPD at A660 of 0.01 were treated with doxycycline (100 μg/ml), and growth was resumed at 30 °C for 12 h. The α-factor (10 μg/ml) and fresh doxycycline (100 μg/ml) were then added, and after 2 h, cells were washed and resuspended in 15 ml of fresh YPD containing doxycycline (100 μg/ml) and treated with 0.2 m hydroxyurea for 30 min. Cells were washed again, resuspended in 15 ml of fresh YPD with doxycycline, and growth resumed for 4 h. The same protocol was used for cells untreated with doxycycline and for wild type cells (CML476). Strain SAY306 (wild type) and SAY302 (sds22-5ts) were synchronized as above, except that growth temperature was 24 °C. After blockage with hydroxyurea, cells were shifted to the nonpermissive temperature (37 °C) and growth resumed for 4 h. In all cases, at different times after the release from the blockage, aliquots of cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 60 min at room temperature and stained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei. 120 min after the release, cells were also collected for tubulin staining (see below). Cells were prepared for indirect immunofluorescence as in Ref. 37Pringle J.R. Adams A.E. Drubin D.G. Haarer B.K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 565-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar and incubated with 1:250 diluted rat monoclonal antibody YL 1/2 raised against yeast α-tubulin (Serotech) (a generous gift of Dr. Jesús Avila, CBM, Madrid, Spain) and subsequently with 1:100 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Alexa Fluor 488; Molecular Probes), to label microtubules. A Color View 12 CCD camera coupled to a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope was used in combination with the Analyze 3.0 software (Soft Imaging System) to capture the images. Exponentially growing yeast cells containing plasmid pADH1-Ypi1-GFP were used to visualize Ypi1-GFP fusion. Aliquots (2 μl) of the cultures were placed on microscope slides and covered with 18 × 18-mm coverslips. The images of Ypi1-GFP and DAPI-stained nuclei were directly captured by fluorescence microscopy, using a Leica DMRXA2 microscope and the Leica FW4000 software. MMR11-1 transformants (expressing Glc7-yEmCitrine) were used to localize Glc7 in the absence of a functional Ypi1 protein in the following way: yeast cells were inoculated into YPD, grown to saturation, diluted at an A600 of 0.01 in YPD, and growth resumed for 1 h. Doxycycline was then added from a 5 mg/ml stock solution (made in 50% ethanol) to achieve a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Control cells received the same volume of vehicle. Growth was resumed, and after 12 h, the same amount of doxycycline or vehicle was added to account for degradation of the antibiotic. Cells were collected after 24 h and fixed by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline/formaldehyde (2%) for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline and kept at 4 °C until further use. Similarly, strain MMR13-4 was used to monitor localization of Glc7 in the absence of a functional Sds22 protein. Cells were grown at 26 °C in YPD until an A600 of 0.5 and then maintained at the same temperature or shifted to 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were taken and fixed as described above. Fluorescently labeled Glc7 and DAPI-stained nuclei were observed under the microscope (Nikon Eclipse E-800) by mixing on a slide 2 μl of the samples with 2 μl of a DAPI-containing mounting solution as described previously (38Pringle J.R.

Protein Phosphatase Assays—Protein phosphatase activity using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate was determined essentially as described previously (39Silberman S.R. Speth M. Nemani R.

The reaction buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were incubated 10 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was then stopped by adding 1% Tris (final concentration). For phosphatase inhibition assays, different amounts of the purified inhibitors were incubated with the purified phosphatases during 5 min at 30 °C, prior to the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in permeabilized cells and expressed in Miller units as described in Ref. 40Ludin K.

Ypi1 Interacts with Sds22 and Glc7—We have recently characterized Ypi1 as an inhibitory subunit of yeast Glc7 protein phosphatase and shown that it performs an essential function (19Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I.

Because Sds22 is an essential protein of 40 kDa that interacts with Glc7 and targets the phosphatase to substrates involved in mitosis and chromosome segregation (see Introduction), we considered that the Ypi1-Sds22 interaction might have functional relevance. However, because it is known that a large number of interactions defined by high throughput methods turn out to be false positives (43von Mering C. Krause R. Snel B. Cornell M. Oliver S.G. Fields S. Bork P. Nature. 2002; 417: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar), we decided to validate such interaction by different methods. We first confirmed the interaction between Sds22 and Ypi1 by a direct co-immunoprecipitation method using cell extracts from yeast expressing GST-Sds22, LexA-Ypi1, and HA-Glc7. Using anti-GST antibodies (to immunoprecipitate GST-Sds22), immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of both Ypi1 (LexA-Ypi1) and Glc7 (HA-Glc7) in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1A). Similarly, when the cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-LexA antibodies (to immunoprecipitate LexA-Ypi1), we were able to recover Sds22 (GST-Sds22) and Glc7 (HA-Glc7) in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B), and finally, when we immunoprecipitated the cell extracts with anti-HA antibodies (to immunoprecipitate HA-Glc7), we recovered Ypi1 (LexA-Ypi1) and Sds22 (GST-Sds22) in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that Sds22, Ypi1, and Glc7 were able to associate physically within the yeast cell. To analyze whether these three proteins formed a complex, we used a triple-hybrid system. This approach has been successfully applied by a number of groups to demonstrate that co-expression of an auxiliary bait is sufficient to strengthen ternary interactions (44Fashena S.J. Serebriiskii I. Golemis E.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 250: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Suter B. Auerbach D. Stagljar I. BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 625-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 3, overexpression of Ypi1 improved the two-hybrid interaction between Sds22 and Glc7 by 14-fold. Similarly, overexpression of Sds22 also improved the magnitude of the two-hybrid interaction between Ypi1 and Glc7 by 150-fold (Table 3). These results suggested that Sds22, Ypi1, and Glc7 may form a stable ternary complex. To confirm these results, we analyzed by gel filtration a crude extract of cells expressing LexA-Sds22, HA-Ypi1, and HA-Glc7. As shown in Fig. 2, most of the three proteins appeared in high mol"

(EC 3.4.17.20; MEROPS, M14.009; UniProt, Q96IY4) is a single chain 60-kDa protein secreted by the liver and found in plasma at an average concentration of 13.4 μg/ml (220 nm) (1Stromqvist M. Schatteman K. Leurs J. Verkerk R. Andersson J.O. Johansson T. Scharpe S. Hendriks D. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). TAFI is N-glycosylated, and the attached glycans account for ∼20% of the overall size of the protein. All five potential N-linked glycosylation sites are occupied, and four of these are located on the activation peptide and one on the enzyme moiety (2Valnickova Z. Christensen T. Skottrup P. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein belongs to the metallocarboxypeptidase family and is also known as plasma pro-carboxypeptidases B, R, and U (3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) leading investigators to explore a role in fibrinolysis. Indeed, the protein appears to be an important regulator of fibrinolysis by removing surface-exposed C-terminal Lys from partially degraded fibrin clots, thus reducing the number of plasminogen-binding sites (8Marx P.F. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 2335-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Activated TAFI (TAFIa) has also been implicated in the regulation of the inflammatory response by inactivating complement-derived inflammatory peptides (9Campbell W. Okada N. Okada H. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Several different proteases are able to activate TAFI in vitro, but thrombin/thrombomodulin has been suggested as the most likely physiologically relevant activator (10Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). At the present, the proteolytic activity is exclusively assigned to TAFIa. This form is generated by cleavage of the Arg92–Ala93 peptide bond releasing the heavily glycosylated activation peptide. The dissociation of the activation peptide from the bulk of the molecule causes the isoelectric point of the enzyme moiety to shift from a pH value of ∼5 to 8, rendering the protein significantly more basic and less soluble (2Valnickova Z. Christensen T. Skottrup P. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, the enzymatic activity of TAFIa is unstable, with a half-life ranging from 1.4 to 15 min at 37 °C, depending on the isoform (11Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12410-12415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This inactivation is highly temperature-dependent and is most likely caused by a change in the structure of TAFIa (11Boffa M.B. Bell R. Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12868-12878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 12Marx P.F. Hackeng T.M. Dawson P.E. Griffin J.H. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. J. Biol.

The structural change appears to expose regions with affinity for α2-macroglobulin and pregnancy zone protein, as these interactions are properties of TAFIa only (13Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12937-12943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and may function as a clearance mechanism to remove TAFIa that escapes covalent cross-linking to the clot catalyzed by transglutaminase (FXIII) during coagulation (14Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27220-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). TAFI is homologous to the pancreatic carboxypeptidases human procarboxypeptidase B (pro-CPB) and human procarboxypeptidases A1 and A2 (pro-CPA1 and pro-CPA2). These are characterized by having preformed active sites. The lack of enzymatic activity of the zymogen is controlled by the N-terminal activation peptide. The activation peptide is located on top of the active site cleft and sterically prevents access of substrate molecules to the catalytic site. As far as pro-CPB is concerned, this shielding is complete, and intrinsic enzymatic activity of the zymogen is negligible (15Reeck G.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to human pro-CPA1 and pro-CPA2, which cleave small peptide substrates. The activity is ∼10% of Vmax for dipeptides and decreases rapidly as the substrates become larger (16Reverter D. Garcia-Saez I. Catasus L. Vendrell J. Coll M. Aviles F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, older studies on pro-carboxypeptidase A from spiny Pacific dogfish and pro-carboxypeptidase B from African lung-fish also show intrinsic peptidase and esterase activity (15Reeck G.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Lacko A.G. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4680-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These properties may be explained by structural differences of the activation peptides (18Garcia-Saez I. Reverter D. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Coll M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6906-6913Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In particular, pro-CPB maintains a salt bridge between the activation peptide (Asp-41) and the S1′ substrate-binding site (Arg-145) in the catalytic moiety. This prevents the C-terminal carboxyl group of the substrate molecule access to the S1′-binding site (Arg-145), required for substrate immobilization. The residue homologous to Asp-41 is lacking in pro-CPA2, obstructing the formation of this salt bridge, which may at least in part explain the intrinsic activity of pro-CPA2. Similarly, the TAFI zymogen lacks the homologous Asp residue in the activation peptide and is most likely not able to form the stabilizing salt bridge (19Barbosa Pereira P.J. Segura-Martin S.

In addition, the heavy glycosylation of the TAFI activation peptide is unique among homologous pro-carboxypeptidases. The focus of this study was to investigate the influence of these properties on the intrinsic activity of the TAFI zymogen. Materials—Bovine trypsin, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-phenanthroline, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and chromogenic substrates for carboxypeptidases, N-benzoyl-Gly-Arg (hippuryl-Arg), N-benzoyl-Gly-Lys (hippuryl-Lys), 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl-Ala-Arg-OH (FAAR) and 3-(2-furyl)acryloyl-Ala-Lys-OH (FAAK), were all obtained from Sigma. The chromogenic trypsin substrate HD-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroaniline was purchased from Chromogenix. Ortho-methylhippuric acid was from Aldrich, and human plasminogen antiserum was obtained from MP Biomedicals. The Actichrome TAFIa activity kit was purchased from American Diagnostica. The TAFI inhibitor 2-guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA) was from Calbiochem. Human plasma was from Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. Proteins and Peptides—TAFI was purified from normal human plasma using plasminogen-depleted plasma as described previously (3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Christensen S. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12937-12943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Porcine CPB was purchased from Calbiochem and further purified on arginine-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) using protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Human plasminogen was purified by affinity chromatography using ECH-lysine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) (20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Human fibrinogen was from Sigma. Recombinant potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (PCI) was a kind gift from Drs. Francesc X. Aviles, Josep Vendrell, and Irantzu G. Palláres. The protein was prepared as previously described (21Molina M.A. Aviles F.X. Querol E. Gene. 1992; 116: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was from ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd., Rehovot, Israel. Synthetic peptides were supplied by Sigma Genosys or assembled in an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using Fast-Moc chemistry. The peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC and verified by mass spectrometry. Recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was a generous gift from Dr. Achim Schuettler (PAION GmbH, Aachen Germany). TAFI polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised commercially (Pel-Freez). Protein and peptide concentrations were determined by amino acid analysis as described previously (22Ozols J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 587-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins were separated on 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (23Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 5 min in the presence of 30 mm dithiothreitol and 1% SDS prior to electrophoresis. Reduction and Alkylation—The sample was reduced for 20 min in 20 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, containing 15 mm dithiothreitol and subsequently carboxymethylated for 20 min using 15 mm iodoacetamide. Generation of Fibrin Peptides—Fibrinogen (30 mg) was reduced and alkylated and then digested with trypsin (1:20 w/w) for 5 h at 37 °C. The trypsin was removed from the sample by affinity chromatography using a benzamidine-Sepharose 4B FF column, connected to an AKTA Prime system (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, the sample was applied to the column equilibrated in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6), and the flow-through containing the fibrin peptides was collected. The bound trypsin was eluted with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.7, and discarded. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the purified fibrin peptides, and the lack of trypsin activity was verified by the inability of the sample to hydrolyze the trypsin substrate HD-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroaniline using a plate reader (Molecular Devices THERMOmax™) operating in the kinetic mode (24Enghild J.J. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Activation of Human TAFI—TAFI was activated by the Solulin-thrombin complex as described previously (2Valnickova Z. Christensen T. Skottrup P. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1525-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In short, 1 μg of TAFI and a complex of 0.5 μg of Solulin and 0.02 μg of thrombin were incubated for 30 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 25 °C. TAFI Zymogen Activity Assay Using Hipp-Arg and Hipp-Lys as Substrates—The assay was performed essentially as described previously (25Hendriks D. Scharpe S. van S e M. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 1936-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples containing TAFI (1 μg) in 10 μl of TBS were incubated with 40 μl of 30 mm hippuryl-Arg or 80 μl of 100 mm hippuryl-Lys for 40 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl or 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and 10 μl of 15 mm ortho-methylhippuric acid was added as an internal standard. The reaction products, as well as the internal standard, were extracted using 300 or 600 μl of ethyl acetate. Subsequently, 100 or 200 μl of the extracts were lyophilized and solubilized in 200 μl of mobile phase (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 3.4, containing 15% acetonitrile) and separated on a reverse phase HPLC column (PTH C18, 5 μm, 220 × 2.1 mm, Applied Biosystems) connected to an AKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). Some TAFI zymogen was pretreated with 1,10-phenanthroline or 4,7-phenanthroline (8 mm final concentration, 20 min, 25 °C) and 10 mm EDTA prior to the addition of the substrate. TAFI Zymogen Activity Assay Using the Actichrome TAFI Activity Kit—This assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (American Diagnostica), except that the supplied activation reagent, activation enhancer, and activation stop reagent were omitted. In short, the samples containing titrations of TAFI zymogen, CPB, or the supplied TAFIa standard were assayed in parallel. The samples were added to 96-well plates in a total volume of 150 μl using the supplied assay buffer. The developer was added to the wells (50 μl), and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The developer contains a tetrapeptide, PFGK (447.25 Da), horseradish peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7), lysine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.14), and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, a substrate for horseradish peroxidase. The lysine oxidase converts the released lysine to 6-amino-2-oxohexanoate, NH3, and H2O2. Horseradish peroxidase utilizes the produced H2O2 and oxidizes the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride to produce a color reaction. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 m H2SO4 to the wells, and finally the plate was measured at 490 nm using a plate reader (Molecular Devices THERMOmax™) operated in end point mode. Analysis of TAFI Zymogen Activity Using Larger Synthetic Peptides—To investigate the TAFI zymogen activity against larger substrates, we prepared two synthetic peptides, RGDSTFESKSYK (1403.67 Da) and ERREKEAREASHRQKRSCEAGK (2640.34 Da). TAFI zymogen and the peptides were incubated at various molar ratios ranging from 1:4 to 1:50 (TAFI zymogen: peptide) for 10 or 60 min at 37 °C in TBS, pH 7.4. The reaction products were either separated by reverse phase chromatography or desalted by Zip tipping (μC18-ZipTip, Millipore) prior to analyses by mass spectrometry. Kinetic Assays Using a Synthetic Fibrin Peptide—Km and kcat values were determined for the synthetic peptide RGDSTFESKSYK (1403.67 Da) using TAFI zymogen, TAFIa, or porcine CPB. The final concentrations of the enzymes were 0.17, 0.025, and 0.0025 μm, respectively, using peptide concentrations ranging from 210 to 2100 μm. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C in TBS and continued for 10 min. Aliquots were removed at timed intervals, the reaction stopped by acidification (0.5% trifluoroacetic acid final concentration), and samples were applied to a reverse phase column (Nucleosil 5 C18, 300A, 250 × 2 mm, Phenomenex) connected to an AKTA Explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted using an isocratic gradient composed of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 16.2% acetonitrile as a mobile phase. The concentration of the truncated peptide was calculated based on the area of the corresponding peak and converted to substrate turnover rates expressed as μm/min. The initial velocities of the product generated at various substrate concentrations were determined by the best-fit line after incubation for various time periods. The values for Km and Vmax were extracted by direct fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the experimental data using non-linear curve fitting employing the method of least squares with Taylor expansion (26Sakoda M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In addition, the data were analyzed by five different graphical methods, including hyperbolic regression and Hanes-Woolf plot. To determine the effect of the released lysine on carboxypeptidase activity of the TAFI zymogen, TAFIa, and CPB, the initial velocities of the RGDSTFESKSYK peptide cleavage at five different substrate concentrations including 0.42, 0.63, 0.84, 1.05, and 1.26 mm were measured in the presence of 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mm lysine. The reciprocal of the initial reaction velocity (1/v) for each substrate concentration was plotted against the inhibitor concentration [I] (Dixon plot) and the Ki value calculated. Additionally, types of inhibitions were depicted by the double reciprocal, plotting 1/v against 1/[S] for each inhibitor concentration (Lineweaver-Burk plot). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)—Peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS on a Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass) operated in reflectron MALDI-TOF MS mode. All experiments were performed using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) as the matrix. The expected mass was calculated using General Protein/Mass Analysis for Windows software (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Plasminogen-binding Assay—A 96-well plate was coated overnight at 4 °C with ovalbumin-CRGDSTFESKSYK peptide conjugate or with purified fibrin peptides (see above). The CRGDSTFESKSYK peptide was coupled using the N-terminal Cys residue (27Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 79: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 28Liu F.T. Zinnecker M. Hamaoka T. Katz D.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Coating agents were diluted in 20 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.2, and 150 μl was added to the wells. On the next day, the plates were blocked and washed in TBS containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). Serial dilutions of TAFI zymogen or porcine CPB were added to the coated wells in 100 μl of TBS/well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. TAFI zymogen was replaced three times during this incubation period (3 × 20 min). This was done to reduce the observed product inhibition by the released lysine. Although CPB also exhibited product inhibition, the Ki was high, and the activity was not significantly affected by the released lysine. Following the TAFI zymogen or CPB treatment of the wells, a fixed concentration of human plasminogen (10 μg/ml) in 100 μl of TBS-T was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed as described above, and bound plasminogen was detected using a standard ELISA protocol including plasminogen antiserum, horseradish peroxidase conjugate secondary antibody (rabbit anti-goat, Sigma), and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as the substrate. The plate was measured at 450 nm in a plate reader (Molecular Devices THERMO-max™) operated in end point mode. Each data point was collected in duplicates. The relative binding capacity of plasminogen was estimated in the linear range of the binding curve. Nonspecific binding was determined by binding of plasminogen to ovalbumin-CRGDSTFESKSYK or fibrin-coated plates pretreated with porcine CPB. The background (<2%) was subtracted from all groups. Plasma in Vitro Clot Lysis Assays—Clot lysis assays were performed essentially as described previously (29Arolas J.L. Lorenzo J. Rovira A. Castella J. Aviles F.X. Sommerhoff C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3441-3448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Walker J.B. Hughes B. James I. Haddock P. Kluft C. Bajzar L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In short, human plasma, diluted 1:3 in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, was added to 96-well microtiter plates. Clotting and fibrinolysis was initiated by adding human thrombin (final concentration 5 nm), CaCl2 (final concentration 10 mm), and tPA (0.02–0.12 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of Solulin (10 nm) and in the presence and absence of GEMSA (1000 μm) or PCI (1600 nm). The absorbance at 405 nm was measured continuously in a plate reader (Molecular Devices THERMOmax™) at 37 °C. The lysis time was determined as the time required for a 50% reduction in absorbance. TAFI Zymogen Cleaves the Substrates Hipp-Arg and Hipp-Lys—When TAFI zymogen was incubated with the carboxypeptidase substrates hippuryl-Lys (Fig. 1A) or hippuryl-Arg (not shown), a low but significant activity was apparent. The separation of the product and the substrate by reverse phase HPLC was critical for detection of the zymogen activity using this system. This activity was eliminated in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig. 1B), supporting the hypothesis that TAFI zymogen exhibits authentic carboxypeptidase activity. EDTA also decreased the release of hippuric acid, although to a lesser extent, whereas 4,7-phenanthroline failed to inhibit the zymogen activity (data not shown). TAFI Zymogen Activity Validated Using Synthetic Peptides— The proteolytic activity of the zymogen was further analyzed using the Actichrome TAFI kit. The TAFI zymogen showed carboxypeptidase activity against the NH2-PFGK peptide, although the activity was severalfold lower than that of porcine CPB (Fig. 2A). To further probe access to the catalytic sites, larger peptides were analyzed. These peptides, RGDSTFESKSYK (1403.67 Da) (Fig. 2B) and ERREKEAREASHRQKRSCEAGK (2640.34 Da) (Fig. 2C), were both cleaved by the zymogen. Approximately 50% of the peptides were cleaved within 10 min using an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:4, and up to 30% of the peptides were cleaved within 60 min using enzyme:substrate ratios of 1:50 (all molar ratios). This shows that the active site of the TAFI zymogen is significantly easier to access than has previously been observed for other pro-carboxypeptidases. TAFI Zymogen Exhibits Activity toward Natural Peptide Substrate—The kinetics of the zymogen carboxypeptidase activity were analyzed in more detail using the synthetic fibrinogen-derived peptide RGDSTFESKSYK. The intact (RGDSTFESKSYK) and the cleaved (RGDSTFESKSY) peptides were readily separated by reverse phase HPLC, providing a quantitative method for analyses of the reaction products (Fig. 2B). The kinetic constants for reaction catalyzed by the TAFI zymogen, TAFIa, or porcine CPB were determined using this assay after the identity of the separated products was verified by MALDI-TOF MS. In each case, the peptide cleavage followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, as illustrated by two different graphical plots, the hyperbolic regression and Hanes-Woolf plots (Fig. 3, A–C and insets, respectively). The obtained kinetic data allowed for the calculation of Km, Vmax, and kcat values (Table 1). The analysis shows that, although the kcat value of the TAFI zymogen is 41-fold lower than the kcat value for TAFIa, the general catalytic potency of the zymogen measured by the kcat/Km ratio is only 18-fold lower than that of the activated protease (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of the obtained kinetic constants using a large peptide substrate (RGDSTFESKSYK) The values for Km and Vmax were extracted by the direct fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to experimental data using five different methods of computation. The data represent the enzyme-catalyzed reactions for 0.17 μm TAFI zymogen, 0.025 μm TAFIa, and 0.0025 μm CPB.EquationTAFI zymogenTAFIaCPBVmaxKmVmaxKmVmaxKmμm/minμmμm/minμmμm/minμmHanes6.88277.1842.31650.1117.67395.66Lineweaver-Burk6.87275.5741.36609.3114.47384.40Eadie-Hofstee6.89277.2841.59618.7017.53387.11Eisenthal-Cornish-Bowden6.92280.9441.43609.9117.50385.11Hyperbolic regression6.92 ± 0.26280.65 ± 30.4141.99 ± 2.88636.35 ± 126.6917.62 ± 0.53393.14 ± 33.85Average values6.89278.3241.73624.8716.95389.08Kcat min–140.591669.205853.33Kcat/Km min–1/μm0.152.6715.04 Open table in a new tab A progress curve of TAFI zymogen-, TAFIa-, and CPB-catalyzed cleavage of peptides with the C-terminal Lys residue declined during the time course of the product formation (Fig. 4). Because one possible reason for this departure from linearity is enzyme product inhibition, we checked the effect of the released lysine on TAFI zymogen, TAFIa, and CPB activity. These analyses showed that lysine reduces the substrate turnover rate in a concentration-dependent manner. By plotting the kinetic data into the Lineweaver-Burk graph, we established that lysine is a simple competitive inhibitor of CPB activity (Fig. 4C, inset), whereas the inhibition of both the TAFI zymogen and TAFIa is mixed but predominantly noncompetitive (Fig. 4, A and B; insets, respectively). Ki values were determined by Dixon plots (data not shown) to be 2.2 mm for TAFI zymogen, 3.8 mm for TAFIa, and 16.0 mm for CPB. Implications of TAFI Zymogen Activity on Fibrinolysis—To analyze the significance of the zymogen activity and its implication on fibrinolysis, a plasminogen-binding assay was devised. Microtiter plates were coated with tryptic fibrinogen peptides containing exposed C-terminal arginine or lysine residues (Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, a synthetic fibrin peptide ovalbumin-(CRGDSTFESKSYK) conjugate was used (Fig. 5C). As expected, plasminogen bound to the peptide-coated wells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). When the plates were pretreated with an increasing amount of porcine CPB, a decrease in the plasminogen-binding capacity was apparent (Fig. 5, B and C). Similarly, when the wells were pretreated with TAFI zymogen, the plasminogen binding decreased (Fig. 5, B and C). This effect was eliminated when porcine CPB or TAFI zymogen were inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline prior to addition to the wells (data not shown). Significantly, the decrease in the plasminogen-binding capacity was substantial at a TAFI zymogen concentration similar to the concentration in human plasma. These data suggest that TAFI zymogen has relevant carboxypeptidase activity that may affect fibrinolysis in vivo. Effect of TAFI Zymogen in tPA-induced Clot Lysis—The thrombin-thrombomodulin (Solulin) complex increases the catalytic efficiency of the TAFI zymogen activation reaction by >1000-fold as compared with thrombin alone (10Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Consequently, it can be presumed that very little if any TAFI zymogen is activated by low thrombin concentrations in the absence of Solulin. We exploited this in an attempt to further investigate the impact of the TAFI zymogen on clot lysis. In the presence of Solulin, clot lysis was significantly delayed (Fig. 6A). This is in agreement with activation of endogenous TAFI zymogen and the subsequent depletion of the Lys-binding sites. When the assay was performed in the presence of thrombin-Solulin complex and PCI, clot lysis was accelerated (Fig. 6A). Significantly, identical clot lysis times were achieved in the presence of thrombin alone (Fig. 6A). In other words, when TAFIa was inhibited by PCI, the effect on clot lysis was the same as when Solulin was omitted from the assay. Apparently, Solulin is required to achieve activation of TAFI zymogen. Additionally, Western blot analysis using a polyclonal TAFI antiserum confirmed that TAFI zymogen was not activated in the absence of Solulin (data not shown). The clot lysis assays were then performed in the absence of Solulin to evaluate the effect of the TAFI zymogen. The addition of TAFI zymogen prolonged clot lysis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). This effect was reversed by the addition of PCI (Fig. 6A) and GEMSA (data not shown). In addition, samples where TAFI was added showed no activation of the zymogen when subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using polyclonal TAFI antiserum (data not shown). It is apparent that the TAFI zymogen is able to function as an inhibitor of fibrinolysis. The glycosylation of the TAFI activation peptide is unique among related pro-carboxypeptidases, which do not carry activation peptide-associated carbohydrate moieties (3Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The attachment of N-linked glycans occurs co-translocationally early during biosynthesis and thus precedes folding of the polypeptide chain (31Kowarik M. Kung S. Martoglio B. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). The importance of glycans during folding is variable, but in general, the folding of glycoproteins that carries a larger number of glycans is more glycan-dependent (32Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). The high density of N-linked glycans on the activation peptide is thus likely to affect the secondary structure and conformational freedom, impacting the overall structure of the activation peptide (33Petrescu A.J. Milac A.L. Petrescu S.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Glycobiology. 2004; 14: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This is of particular importance, because the activation peptide of pro-carboxypeptidases functions as a gatekeeper controlling access to the preformed active site. The activation peptide-associated glycans may thus be important for the observed intrinsic catalytic activity of TAFI zymogen. The TAFI zymogen activity was initially observed in assays using the synthetic substrates Hipp-Arg and Hipp-Lys followed by extraction and reverse phase HPLC separation of the substrate and product. This was performed according to a protocol where the hippuric acid product was detected at 228 nm (25Hendriks D. Scharpe S. van S e M. Clin. Chem. 1985; 31: 1936-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of this assay is significantly increased as compared with the more common direct measurement of the reaction products in the spectrophotometer at 254 nm (7Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 34Folk J.E. Piez K.A. Carroll W.R. Gladner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2272-2277Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At 254 nm, an overlap in the absorbance of Hipp-Arg or Hipp-Lys and hippuric acid decreases the dynamic range of this assay. In addition, the hydrophobic and bulky nature of the Hipp-Arg or Hipp-Lys substrates might limit access to the active site of TAFI zymogen. Similarly, 3-(2-furyl)-acryloyl-Ala-Arg-OH (FAAR) and 3-(2-Furyl)-acryloyl-Ala-Lys-OH (FAAK) (35Plummer Jr., T.H. Kimmel M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 108: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) appeared to lack sensitivity. This was in contrast to another chromogenic assay using the peptide PFGK (447.25 Da), where TAFI zymogen activity was readily detected. This assay appeared to be significantly more sensitive, although a direct comparison was not attempted. To probe the size restriction imposed on the TAFI zymogen, two larger peptides were prepared, including RGDSTFESKSYK (1403.67 Da) and ERREKEAREASHRQKRSCEAGK (2640.34 Da). These are the largest substrates a pro-carboxypeptidase has been shown to cleave, providing evidence that the active site of the TAFI zymogen is significantly more accessible than observed previously with other pro-carboxypeptidases (15Reeck G.R. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3947-3955Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Reverter D. Garcia-Saez I. Catasus L. Vendrell J. Coll M. Aviles F.X. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Lacko A.G. Neurath H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4680-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Without structural data, however, the nature and geometry of this access remains unclear. In comparison to TAFIa, the peptide substrate turnover rate of the TAFI zymogen is 41-fold lower but compensated by a 2-fold higher affinity for the substrate. At the low substrate concentrations likely to exist within the fibrin clot, the zymogen will have an advantage as compared with TAFIa because of tighter substrate-binding ability. Additionally, in contrast to TAFIa, the TAFI zymogen displays sustained carboxypeptidase activity. This allows the TAFI zymogen to react with the fibrin clot for an extended period of time or until its activity is dampened by the increasing concentration of lysine. In this context, it is tempting to hypothesize that the mechanism of the observed TAFI-associated inhibition of fibrinolysis is regulated by the intrinsic lability of TAFIa and the lower but significant activity of the TAFI zymogen. To this end, generation of TAFIa by the action of thrombin-thrombomodulin during the initial clotting event is associated with an initial burst of the carboxypeptidase activity followed be a sustained slow rate cleavage executed by the TAFI zymogen. Collectively, this new mechanism may provide an additional sophisticated tuning of the rate of clot solubilization in vivo. The validity of this hypothesis was substantiated by plasminogen-binding assays, where peptides containing C-terminal Lys residues were immobilized in ELISA plates. The ability of plasminogen to bind to this simulated fibrin clot was significantly reduced at physiological TAFI concentrations (10 ng/μl). The observed reduction in plasminogen binding is proportional to a reduction in plasminogen activation, suggesting that the TAFI zymogen is able to significantly impact fibrinolysis. It is interesting to note that the TAFI zymogen is a substrate for transglutaminases, and two of the three amine acceptor sites are located near the N-terminal of the activation peptide (14Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27220-27224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This may facilitate the immobilization of the TAFI zymogen to the fibrin clot by the action of FXIIIa during the final stages of the coagulation, thus increasing the local TAFI zymogen concentration. The potential physiological importance of the observation was further evaluated in tPA-induced clot lysis assays. These experiments showed that the zymogen significantly prolonged the duration of a clot at concentrations similar to what is found in vivo. The activity was abolished by PCI and GEMSA, corroborating that the observed effect was caused by genuine carboxypeptidase activity. Fibrinolysis was inhibited by the addition of increasing amounts of the zymogen, even though no activation of TAFI was observed, suggesting that the zymogen intrinsic activity is relevant in vivo. Taken together, we have shown that the TAFI zymogen is active toward large peptide substrates, cleaves exposed Lys residues at a physiologically relevant concentration, and attenuates fibrinolysis in tPA-induced clot lysis in vitro. The genuine, continuous, and stable carboxypeptidase activity of TAFI zymogen offers sustained protection of the fibrin clot in vivo and constitutes a novel, previously unrecognized mechanism with the potential to significantly impact fibrinolysis.

https://openalex.org/W2031538679,"This report provides the first evidence that human P450 4F2 (CYP4F2) is induced by statins, which are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Real time PCR and immunoblots indicate that lovastatin treatment increases expression of the endogenous CYP4F2 gene in human primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. The effects of lovastatin on gene expression are often mediated through sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). Immunoblots indicate that lovastatin-treated human hepatocytes display increased proteolytic processing of SREBP-2. In HepG2 cells, co-administration of a potent suppressor of SREBP-2 activation, 25-hydroxycholesterol, inhibits CYP4F2 mRNA induction by lovastatin. HepG2 cells transfected with an expression vector for the active nuclear form of SREBP-1a (nSREBP-1a) also display elevated endogenous CYP4F2 expression. Luciferase reporters containing the CYP4F2 proximal promoter are transactivated by nSREBPs (-1a, -1c, and -2) or a dominant positive form of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which facilitates activation of endogenous SREBPs. Lovastatin-induced reporter expression is inhibited by overexpressed Insig-1, which prevents proteolytic activation of endogenous SREBPs. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with in vitro translated nSREBP-1a identified two SREBP binding sites at –169/–152 and –109/–92, relative to the CYP4F2 transcription start site. Mutations in each site abolish SREBP binding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that more SREBP-1 is associated with the CYP4F2 promoter after overexpression of nSREBP-1a. Transfection studies and mutagenesis indicate that the –109/–92 region is the primary site responsible for the effects of statins. Collectively, these results demonstrate that SREBPs transactivate CYP4F2 transcription and that CYP4F2 induction by statins is mediated by SREBP-2.

The capacity to oxidize the terminal carbon of aliphatic chains is a highly conserved enzymatic activity of cytochrome P450s in plant and animal species. In mammals, the ω-hydroxylation of fatty acids provides a means to remove potentially toxic excess concentrations of free fatty acids. This is the first step in the formation of dicarboxylic acids that can be more readily excreted or are further degraded by peroxisomal β-oxidation. The ω-hydroxylases also provide pathways for the degradation of signaling molecules such as prostanoids and leukotrienes.

Cytochrome P450 4F2 (P450 4F2) is a fatty acid ω-hydroxylase that is expressed in human liver and kidney and contributes to free fatty acid catabolism and the conversion of arachidonic acid to 20-HETE. In humans, the predominant ω-hydroxylases in liver and kidney are microsomal P450s 4A11, 4F2, and 4F3B (4Nishimura M. Yaguti H. Yoshitsugu H. Naito S. Satoh T.

Regulated expression of CYP4 genes contributes to fatty acid homeostasis and prevention of lipotoxicity by increasing the capacity to remove excess free fatty acids. The expression of CYP4A genes in several mammalian species is elevated by conditions that increase the flux of free fatty acids, such as fasting and exposure to hypolipidemic drugs, such as fibrates. These responses are mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (18Muerhoff A.S. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19051-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). In contrast to CYP4A genes, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonists generally suppress the hepatic expression of rat and mouse CYP4F mRNAs and these responses are peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α independent (20Kawashima H. Kusunose E. Thompson C.M. Strobel H.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 347: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 21Cui X. Kawashima H. Barclay T.B. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Morgan E.T. Strobel H.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 542-550PubMed Google Scholar). Statins, which are widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, also induce CYP4A gene expression in rat liver and rat hepatocytes (22Kocarek T.A. Reddy A.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1996; 24: 1197-1204PubMed Google Scholar). Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. In addition to impairing the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates, cholesterol, oxysterols, and bile acids, statins also increase cholesterol uptake via increased expression of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. These effects are mediated through activation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) by proteolytic cleavage. SREBPs belong to the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of DNA-binding proteins. Three isoforms of SREBP have been identified, SREBP-1a, -1c, and -2. The DNA binding domains of SREBP-1a and -1c are identical, and they share over 70% identity with the corresponding domain of SREBP-2. Human SREBP-2 is encoded by a gene on chromosome 22. SREBP-1a and -1c are produced from a single gene on chromosome 17 through the usage of alternative transcription start sites that generate an alternative exon 1. SREBP-2 is predominantly involved in regulating the cholesterol synthesis pathway, whereas SREBP-1c mainly controls fatty acid synthesis (23Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Horton J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2115-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 24McPherson R. Gauthier A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). SREBP-1a, the major SREBP-1 form found in many cell lines, regulates both cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (25Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). After translation, the membrane bound precursor forms of SREBP bind to the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the presence of sterols, Insig (insulin-induced gene) protein binds to the sterol-sensing domain of SCAP and retains the SCAP-SREBP complex in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. When intracellular sterol levels are depleted, the SCAP-SREBP complex is transferred to the Golgi where the precursor form of SREBP is proteolytically cleaved to produce the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment that is transported into the nucleus and regulates gene transcription (26Goldstein J.L. Bose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice that overexpress a transcriptionally active form of SREBP-1a, hepatic CYP4A expression was increased (27Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). In contrast, hepatic CYP4F13 and CYP4F14 mRNA levels were diminished in these mice, but CYP4F12 mRNA was up-regulated. Taken together, these results suggest a role for SREBP in the regulation of fatty acid ω-hydroxylases and in the effects of statins on CYP4 gene expression in mice. The present study examined the effects of statins on the regulation of the CYP4F2 and CYP4F3B genes in human-derived HepG2 cells as well as in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Our results indicate that P450 4F2 is selectively induced by statins and demonstrate that this effect is mediated by SREBPs through an enhancer in the proximal promoter of the CYP4F2 gene. Constructs—pcDNA3-FLAG-nSREBP-1a was obtained from Dr. J. Ericsson at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. The pcDNA-FLAG-nSREBP-1c and pcDNA-FLAG-nSREBP-2 plasmids were obtained from Dr. T. Osborne, University of California, Irvine. The pCMV-INSIG-1-Myc, pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7(D443N), and pTK-HSV-SCAP-T7 expression plasmids were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). PCR primers spanning various regions of the CYP4F2 5′-flanking region were used to amplify specific regions from the cosmid F20129 (AC005336) (MRC Geneservice, Cambridge, UK), which contains the CYP4F2 gene and the complete 5′ inter-gene region. The –753/+464 and –176/+464 PCR fragments were subcloned into a luciferase reporter plasmid (pLuc) and sequenced. The –176/–6 and –6/+464 pLuc reporter constructs were generated by digesting the –176/+464 reporter vector with StuI and BamHI and blunt end filling with Klenow large fragment followed by ligation. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the –67/–1 region of the CYP4F2 gene were inserted between the HindIII and BamHI sites of the pLuc reporter. For the luciferase constructs containing the CYP4F2 natural promoter, the mutant constructs were generated using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The correctness of each construct was confirmed by sequencing. Plasmid DNA for transfection experiments was prepared using the Qiagen Plasmid isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or the Eppendorf Perfectprep® plasmid kit (Brinkmann). Cell Culture—Human hepatoma cells, HepG2, were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO). The medium was supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, minimal essential medium nonessential amino acid mixture and penicillin/streptomycin. For non-transfected HepG2 cells, the cells were seeded at a density that would reach 70–80% confluence after 24 h. When the cells reached the appropriate density, they were maintained in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine lipoprotein-deficient serum (Intracel, Frederick, MD) for 1 day before being incubated with 1 μm lovastatin or fluvastatin (EMD Biosciences, LA Jolla, CA) or mevastatin (Sigma) or 5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (Sigma) or vehicle (Me2SO). After 24 h, cells were harvested. For nSREBP-1a transfection studies, the cells were transfected with pcDNA-FLAG-nSREBP-1a using Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen). For each T25 flask, 1 μg of nSREBP-1a expression plasmid and 20 μl of Lipofectamine were used. After transfection, cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 48 h. The cells were harvested and used for immunoblot, RT-PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. Primary Human Hepatocyte Culture—Primary human hepatocytes from two individuals were obtained from CellzDirect (Tucson, AZ). No known history of, or exposure to, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, cirrhosis, biliary diseases, or HIV was evident for these individuals. In addition, both were non-smokers with no known drug or alcohol abuse. One individual was a 77-year-old female Caucasian (Hu374), and the other was a 53-year-old female Caucasian (Hu419). The cells were seeded on collagen-coated 6-well plates with a Matrigel overlay. After receipt, the cells were maintained in modified Chee’s medium supplemented with dexamethasone (0.1 μm) and insulin, transferrin, and sodium selenite (ITS, Sigma). The media was replaced with fresh media daily. After 1–3 days, the cells were treated with 1 μm statins or Me2SO (vehicle). The cells were harvested for immunoblot and RT-PCR studies after a 24-h drug treatment. Total RNAs and proteins were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcription and PCR Amplification—TRIzol reagent or the E.N.Z.A. total RNA isolation kit (Omega Bio-tek, Atlanta, GA) were used for total RNA isolation. Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) and an oligo(dT) primer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were used to generate first-strand cDNAs. Specific PCR primers for the CYP4F2, CYP4F3, and cyclophilin A (PPIA) cDNAs were used to generate gene-specific fragments. The PCR primer sets are: CYP4F2 (U02388: 244–730), upper primer 5′-GACACCAGGGCATGGTCAACC-3′ and lower primer 5′-GCGGCAATATATTCACTGGGTTTC-3′; CYP4F3 (NM_000896: 756–1630), upper primer 5′-CACCAGCAGATCCTCCTGTACATA-3′ and lower primer 5′-GTGGGTCTCTGCAGAACTCAGCTCAG-3′; PPIA (NM_021130:274–536), upper primer 5′-CCATCTATGGGGAGAAATTTGA-3′ and lower primer 5′-GAGTTGTCCACAGTCAGCAATG-3′. PPIA was used as a control to normalize RNA levels. PCR were performed using the following conditions: 1 cycle at 97 °C for 3 min, multiple cycles (97 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min), and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The number of amplification cycles used for each product was empirically determined based on the observed mRNA levels of the target genes. Real Time PCR—Amplicons corresponding to the CYP4F2 (487 bp) and PPIA (263 bp) mRNAs were generated by RT-PCR from HepG2 cells, subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Serial dilutions of each plasmid were used as a reference to determine the copy number of mRNA in each sample. Total RNA (5 μg) from HepG2 cells or human hepatocytes was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer and Stratascript (Stratagene) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl according to the supplier’s protocol. The reverse transcription mixture was diluted 2-fold with water and 2 μl of diluted reaction mixture were used as template for PCR. For real time thermal cycling, triplicate aliquots of serially diluted amplicon or RT sample were used in a reaction mixture that contained 250 nm of each primer in a reaction volume of 20 μl using the IQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). A Bio-Rad iCYCLER iQ real time PCR instrument was used for these experiments. The same primer sets used in RT-PCR were also used in this study. The thermal cycling was started with an initial 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 2 min. CYP4F2 mRNA concentration for each sample was calculated by mapping the threshold cycle to the plasmid concentration on the standard curve. Messenger RNA quantities were obtained in a similar manner for PPIA from the same samples using the PPIA amplicon. Microsomal and Nuclear Protein Isolation—Harvested cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and pelleted at 3,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 μm), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (0.1 μm), and protease inhibitor mixture (PIC) (Roche) were included in the ice-cold buffers prior to use in all of the following steps. The cells were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40 (homogenization buffer). After incubation on ice for 5 min, the resuspended cells were homogenized using Radnoti tissue grinders (20 strokes). After centrifugation at 550 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were saved for microsomal fraction isolation. The pellets were washed with homogenization buffer and re-centrifuged at 550 × g for 5 min. The final pellets were resuspended in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol, prior to incubation on a rotator at 4 °C for 1 h. The nuclear extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants from the 550 × g centrifugation were pooled and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The resulting pellets represent the membrane fractions that were resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. The protein contents of the nuclear and membrane fractions were determined using Pierce BCA assay (Pierce). Aliquots of the nuclear and the membrane fractions were stored at –80 °C until used. Immunoblots—Microsomal proteins, nuclear proteins, total cellular proteins, or commercially obtained Supersomes containing P450 4F2 (BD Gentest, Woburn, MA) were separated in 10% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P450 4F2/4F3 (a gift of Dr. Lasker) (13Powell P.K. Wolf I. Jin R. Lasker J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar) or SREBP-1 (clone K-10) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by a monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with peroxidase (clone RG-96) (Sigma). For SREBP-2 detection, a mouse anti-SREBP-2 monoclonal antibody (IgG-1C6 clone) (BD Pharmingen) was used followed by a polyclonal anti-mouse IgG conjugated with peroxidase (Sigma). A rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclophilin A antibody (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) or a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (JLA20 clone) (EMD Bioscience) was used to normalize sample loading. The blots were developed with the Western Lightening Plus Chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reporter Transfection—HepG2 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing various regions of the CYP4F2 gene using a modified calcium phosphate method as described previously (28Hsu M-H. Savas U. Griffin K.J. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27950-27958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase was used to normalize transfection efficiency. Costar 24-well plates were used for transfection studies. Details for each experiment are described in each figure legend. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Oligonucleotides spanning discrete areas of the –176/–67 region of CYP4F2 gene and oligonucleotides containing specific mutations in potential response elements were synthesized. An excess molar ratio of [γ-32P]ATP was used to end label both of the complementary oligonucleotide strands using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The 32P-labeled oligonucleotides were then annealed, gel purified, and the specific activities of each double-stranded probe were determined. Reaction mixtures containing 20 fmol of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated with 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with pcDNA3-FLAG-nSREBP-1a or with control rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The reactions also contained 125 ng/μl of poly(dI-dC) and 20 ng/μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen). For supershift analysis, 0.5 μl of anti-FLAG® M2 monoclonal antibody (Stratagene) was included in the incubation mixture. After incubating for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide (37.5:1) gel as described (29Palmer C.N.A. Hsu M.H. Griffin K.J. Raucy J.L. Johnson E.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The dried gels were analyzed using a GE Healthcare PhosphorImager, model SI. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (ChIP)—A modification of the protocol described by Nowak et al. (30Nowak D.E. Tian B. Brasier A.R.

Briefly, nSREBP-1a transfected HepG2 cells and the corresponding control cells transfected with the empty vector were first exposed to a cross-linker, 2 mm disuccinimidyl glutarate (Pierce), at room temperature for 45 min. Then the cells were fixed with 1% (v/v) formaldehyde for 10 min. Glycine was added to 125 mm and incubated for another 5 min at room temperature to stop the cross-linking reaction. The cells were lysed by incubation in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% IGEPAL 630 (Sigma), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, PIC, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, on ice for 15 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 1200 × g for 5 min and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Samples were sonicated using 20-s pulses with 30 s rest on a setting of 4 for a total time of 8 min using a microtip and Misonix sonicator 3000. The degree of DNA fragmentation was verified by gel electrophoresis after reversing the cross-linking reaction as described below. If needed, sonication was repeated until the size distribution was predominantly between 200 and 500 bp. The CHIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) and Protein G magnetic beads (New England Biolabs) were used to generate immunoprecipitated, protein-bound DNA using an anti-SREBP-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (K-10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). IgG obtained from non-immunized rabbit serum (Sigma) was used as a control. Eluted DNA was heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the cross-linking and then purified using the E.Z.N.A. Cycle Pure Kit (Biomiga). PCR analysis was used to analyze the resulting immunoprecipitated DNA. The PCR primers that were used are: LDL receptor oligonucleotides (L29401, 471 to 650) 5′-CGATGTCACATCGGCCGTTCG-3′ and 5′-CACGACCTGGTGTGTCGTAGCTGGAA-3′; and 4F2 oligonucleotides (AF467894, 1942–2137; –188 to +8, relative to the transcription start site) 5′-TGTGCATCTACCCATCCATCTGGA-3′ and 5′-TGTCTGCTGGGAGGCCTTTGA-3′. PCR were performed using the following conditions: 1 cycle at 97 °C for 3 min, multiple cycles (97 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 3 min), and 1 cycle at 72 °C for 5 min. The number of amplification cycles used for each target gene was empirically determined. Statistical Analysis—A one-tail Student’s t test was used to determine statistically significant differences between sample mean ± S.E. using Microsoft Excel software. Statins Induce Endogenous CYP4F2 Gene Expression in Human Primary Hepatocytes and HepG2 Cells—Real time PCR results (Fig. 1A) indicate that CYP4F2 mRNA levels found in primary cultures of two independent preparations of human hepatocytes that had been treated for 24 h with lovastatin or mevastatin were elevated 2–6-fold relative to cells treated with Me2SO vehicle after normalization to PPIA mRNA levels. However, statin treatment did not affect CYP4F3 mRNA expression (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. Analysis of five independent HepG2 experiments indicates that CYP4F2 mRNA levels are elevated 2.9 ± 0.9-fold (mean ± S.E., p < 0.05) by a 24-h lovastatin treatment compared with the cells treated with Me2SO only (Fig. 1A). CYP4F3 mRNA levels were not appreciably altered by statin treatment (data not shown). Others have reported a similar -fold induction by lovastatin treatment in HepG2 cells for several known SREBP target genes, including: HMCR (∼2.5-fold with 1 μm lovastatin) (31Molowa D.T. Cimis G.M.

https://openalex.org/W2003998454,"Glycosyltransferases are present in the Golgi apparatus in a membrane-bound form and are released from cells after cleavage by certain proteases. Beta1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), which is cleaved and secreted from the cells, is involved in the biosynthesis of beta1-6GlcNAc branching on N-glycans and has been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis. We recently reported that a secreted type of GnT-V (soluble GnT-V) itself could promote angiogenesis, which is completely different from its original function as a glycosyltransferase, and this might play a role in tumor invasion. In this study, to explore the molecular basis for this functional glycosyltransferase secretion, its cleavage site was examined and the protease(s) involved in that cleavage were identified. The NH2-terminal protein sequence of purified soluble GnT-V (approximately 100 kDa) from GnT-V-overexpressed cells revealed that its terminus started at His31, located at the boundary position between the transmembrane and stem regions. This secretion was not inhibited by a single amino acid mutation at the cleavage site (Leu29, Leu30 to Asp, His31 to Ala), but specifically inhibited by addition of DFK-167, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that gamma-secretase is a plausible protease for secretion processing. In addition, transfection of the gene of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)[corrected]-linked presenilin-1, a component of gamma-secretase, increased the secretion rate of endogenous GnT-V; the secretion of soluble GnT-V (approximately 100 kDa) was completely inhibited in presenilin-1/2 double-deficient cells, which have no gamma-secretase activity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Golgi-resident GnT-V is cleaved at the transmembrane region by gamma-secretase, and this might control tumor angiogenesis through a novel pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1965137717,"Although duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion (DMBS) is currently accepted as an important defense mechanism against acid-induced duodenal injury, the mechanism and the regulation of DMBS are largely unknown. 5-HT may regulate DMBS, but little is known about its physiological relevance in DMBS and the underlying mechanism(s). Thus, the aims of the present study were to demonstrate the role of 5-HT in acid-stimulated DMBS and to further elucidate the precise mechanisms involved in this process. Luminal acid stimulation significantly increased 5-HT release from the duodenal mucosa (P<0.01). SB204070, a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, dose-dependently reduced luminal acid-stimulated HCO3(-) secretion of mice in vivo. In Ussing chamber studies, 5-HT-induced I(SC) and DMBS were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+, and significantly attenuated by pharmacological blockade of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), intermediate Ca2+-activated K+ channels (IK(Ca)), or cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 5-HT increased cytoplasmic free calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) in SCBN cells, a duodenal epithelial cell line, and knockdown of NCX1 proteins with a specific siRNA greatly decreased this 5-HT-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that 5-HT plays a physiological role in acid-stimulated DMBS via a Ca2+ signaling pathway, in which the plasma membrane NCX transporter as well as IK(Ca) and CFTR channels may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2039192169,"CrmA is a “cross-class” serpin family inhibitor of the proapoptotic serine protease, granzyme B, as well as cysteine proteases of the caspase family. To determine whether crmA inhibits these structurally diverse proteases by a common conformational trapping mechanism, we mapped the position of the protease in crmA complexes with granzyme B or caspase-1 by fluorescence perturbation and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses of site-specific fluorophore-labeled crmAs. A reactive loop P6 NBD label underwent similar large fluorescence enhancements (>200%) either upon reactive loop cleavage by AspN protease or complex formation with granzyme B or caspase-1, consistent with the insertion of the cleaved reactive loop into sheet A in both types of crmA-protease complexes. NBD labels on the noninserting part of the reactive loop docking site for protease (P1′ residue) or midway between the two ends of sheet A (helix F residue 101) showed no significant perturbations due to protease complexation. By contrast, labels at positions 68 and 261, lying at the end of sheet A most distal from the reactive loop, showed marked perturbations distinct from those induced by AspN cleavage and thus ascribable to granzyme B or caspase-1 proximity in the complexes. Substantial FRET between protease tryptophans and 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl-labeled crmAs occurred in protease complexes with crmAs labeled at the 68 and 261 positions, but not the P1′ position. These results suggest that granzyme B and caspase-1 are inhibited by crmA by a common mechanism involving full reactive loop insertion into sheet A and translocation of the protease to the distal end of the sheet as previously found for inhibition of other serine proteases by serpins.

The serpins are an ever expanding superfamily of proteins that are found in all types of organisms and thus thought to have an early evolutionary origin (1Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G.W. Irving J.A. Lomas D.A. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). These proteins have in common a conserved ∼350-residue core globular domain consisting of three β-sheets and eight to nine α-helices and are known to function in a vast array of physiologic processes (3Gettins P.G.W. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Most members of the family inhibit and thereby regulate the activity of specific proteolytic enzymes by forming stable stoichiometric complexes with the enzymes through an exposed reactive center loop. The mechanism of this inhibition is unusual from the point of view of it being dependent on conformational changes in the serpin and protease and involving a branched pathway leading to alternate substrate and inhibitor modes of reaction, i.e. the mechanism resembles that of a suicide substrate inhibitor (4Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Another most unusual feature of serpins is their ability to inhibit proteases from more than one mechanistic or structural classes, a property that has been termed “cross-class inhibition” (5Komiyama T. Ray C.A. Pickup D.J. Thornberry N.A. Peterson E.P. Salvesen G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19331-19337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first serpin shown to possess such cross-class inhibition was the cowpox virus serpin, cytokine response modifier A or crmA (6Ray C.A. Black R.A. Kronheim S.R. Greenstreet T.A. Sleath P.R. Salvesen G.S. Pickup D.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). CrmA was shown to inhibit the proinflammatory cysteine protease, interleukin-1β converting enzyme, also known as caspase-1, and subsequently other caspases in the apoptotic pathway, as well as the proapoptotic serine protease, granzyme B (7Quan L.T.

This ability to inhibit two structurally and mechanistically distinct families of proteases was an unprecedented finding in view of the strict specificity toward a single mechanistic and structural class of protease that had been exhibited by other known protein protease inhibitor families (9Laskowski Jr., M. Kato I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 593-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Subsequently, other serpins were shown to have this same ability to inhibit cysteine proteases of either the papain or caspase families and this ability was found to be engineerable into serpins by making the reactive loop sequence compatible with the substrate recognition determinants of a cysteine protease (10Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Dai W. Brömme D. Worrall D.M. Silverman G.A. Coetzer T.H.T. Dennison C. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C.

Silverman G.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5258-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). An outstanding question that remains to be answered is whether serpins utilize the same conformational change-dependent mechanism to inhibit both serine and cysteine classes of protease. In the established mechanism for serpin inhibition of serine proteases, the serpin and protease form an initial Michaelis-type complex that then converts to an acyl-intermediate complex in which the protease catalytic serine is covalently linked to the serpin P1 residue and the reactive loop is cleaved at the P1–P1′ bond. The serpin subsequently undergoes a major conformational change wherein the N-terminal end of the cleaved loop inserts into the center of β-sheet A, dragging the tethered protease along ∼70 Å to the opposite end of the molecule where the protease is inactivated by conformational deformation (12Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar, 13Dementiev A. Dobó J. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3452-3457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Whether cysteine proteases are inactivated by the same conformational change-driven mechanism is a germane question because of some fundamentally different properties of the reactions of serpins with the two types of protease. Whereas serpin reactions with serine proteases typically result in the formation of equimolar SDS-stable complexes that represent stable acyl-intermediates, the reactions with cysteine proteases do not produce such SDS-stable complexes and are observable only under native nondenaturing conditions (5Komiyama T.

Moreover, studies of the mechanism by which a serpin inhibits a nontarget cysteine protease revealed that inhibition arose from autolysis of complexed protease by free protease, suggesting a possible variation from the acyl-intermediate trapping mechanism demonstrated for serine protease inhibition (14Björk I. Nordling K. Raub-Segall E. Hellman U. Olson S.T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have addressed the question of whether serpins inhibit cysteine proteases by the same conformational change-dependent mechanism established for inhibition of serine proteases. To do this, we have applied the fluorescence perturbation and FRET 2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; IANBD, iodoacetamido-NBD; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; IAEDANS, 5-[2-(2-iodoacetamido)ethylamino]-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; DANS, dansyl (5-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl); SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. 2The abbreviations used are: FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; DTT, dithiothreitol; AMC, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; IANBD, iodoacetamido-NBD; NBD, 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; IAEDANS, 5-[2-(2-iodoacetamido)ethylamino]-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; DANS, dansyl (5-aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl); SI, stoichiometry of inhibition; α1PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. approaches used in previous studies to map the position of the protease in a serpin-serine protease complex (15Stratikos E.

This was accomplished by engineering single cysteine variants of crmA and labeling the variants with fluorophore probes to provide site-specific reporter groups for localization of the two target proteases in crmA-protease complexes. Our findings show that the protease is translocated to similar positions at the distal end of sheet A in stable crmA complexes with both granzyme B and caspase-1 and support similar conformational change-dependent mechanisms for serpin inhibition of the two classes of protease. Proteins—Granzyme B was purified from cytotoxic T lymphocytes as described (17Hanna W.L. Zhang X. Turbov J. Winkler U. Hudig D. Froelich C.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the protease were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology) and confirmed to be in close agreement (<15%) with values determined from the 280-nm absorbance using an extinction coefficient calculated from the amino acid sequence (18Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). The stoichiometric inhibition of the enzyme by crmA and formation of an SDS-stable complex (see “Results”) implied that the enzyme was fully functional. Caspase-1 was generously provided by Dr. Nancy Thornberry, Merck, Rahway, NJ, or the enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified according to Thornberry et al. (19Rano T.A.

The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m guanidine-HCl and an equimolar mixture refolded in the presence of a YVKD-aldehyde affinity matrix (19Rano T.A. Timkey T. Peterson E.P. Rotonda J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 38781-38790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzyme bound to the affinity matrix was eluted with free YVAD-aldehyde, activated with hydroxylamine, and finally converted to a glutathione disulfide adduct according to the protocol detailed previously (21Dobó J.

Enzyme was stored at –80 °C in HSC buffer (0.1 m Hepes, 0.1% CHAPS, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20% sucrose, pH 7.5). Caspase-1 was activated just prior to use by incubation with HSC buffer containing 5–10 mm DTT. The concentration of functional caspase-1 was determined by active-site titration as described below. Recombinant wild-type crmA and a variant crmA in which all nine cysteines were mutated to serine were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified as in previous studies (22Simonovic M. Gettins P.G.W. Volz K. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), with the inclusion of a final Mono-Q chromatography step to ensure the isolation of monomeric crmA free of polymers as described (23Tesch L.D. Raghavendra M.P. Bedsted-Faarvang T. Gettins P.G.W. Olson S.T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Single-cysteine crmA variants were engineered by mutagenesis procedures identical to those used to create the variant with all cysteines mutated to serine as described (23Tesch L.D. Raghavendra M.P. Bedsted-Faarvang T. Gettins P.G.W. Olson S.T. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CrmA concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a calculated extinction coefficient of 31,900 m–1 cm–1 from the amino acid composition (18Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Experimental Conditions—Characterization of the kinetics and stoichiometry of caspase-1 reactions with crmA variants were conducted in HSC buffer containing 5 mm DTT at 25 °C except where noted. Measurements of fluorescence emission spectra of labeled crmAs in the absence and presence of caspase-1 were performed in HSC buffer lacking sucrose but containing 5 mm DTT. All experiments characterizing the reactions of crmAs with granzyme B or with AspN protease were performed in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% PEG 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Active-site Titration of Caspase-1—Solutions of YVAD-chloromethylketone (Bachem) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 nm were made up in HSC buffer lacking DTT by dilution from a stock solution in 0.1 mm HCl. Freshly activated caspase-1 was then added to a final concentration of 100 nm. The final DTT concentration in the incubation was 0.5 mm. The concentration of the stock chloromethylketone solution was determined from the tyrosine absorbance at 276 nm after dilution into HSC buffer without sucrose using an extinction coefficient of 1450 m–1 cm–1. After incubation for 1–2 min, residual enzyme activity was measured by addition of YVAD-AMC substrate (25 μm final concentration) in HSC buffer lacking sucrose and monitoring the initial linear rate of substrate hydrolysis fluorimetrically using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. Plotting of the residual activity versus inhibitor concentration and fitting to a straight line by linear regression analysis yielded the functional caspase-1 concentration from the end point on the abscissa axis. That the end point was not affected by any significant inactivation of the chloromethylketone by DTT during the time of reaction was shown by the finding that when similar reactions were conducted at twice the enzyme concentration to increase the reaction rate with the chloromethylketone titrant, indistinguishable results were obtained. Separate measurements of the inactivation of 1 nm caspase-1 by a large molar excess of chloromethylketone (10 nm) (pseudo-first order conditions) in caspase-1 buffer containing 0.5 mm DTT by quenching aliquots into substrate and measuring residual enzyme activity as above indicated a second-order rate constant of 1.3 × 106 m–1 s–1, consistent with completion of the reaction during the incubation time allowed. From the active-site concentration, a turnover number of 80 min–1 was measured for reaction of caspase-1 with 25 μm YVAD-AMC in HSC buffer without sucrose at 25 °C based on the caspase-1 (p20-p10)2 tetramer concentration (two active-sites/tetramer), a value indistinguishable from that calculated from the published specific activity of active-site titrated caspase-1 with YVAD-AMC (20Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Labeling—Single cysteine crmA variants were labeled with IANBD or IAEDANS fluorophores (Molecular Probes) by dialyzing the proteins overnight versus 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.2, buffer containing 50 μm DTT with a final buffer change containing 25 μm DTT. The iodoacetamido-fluorophore dissolved in Me2SO was added to ∼10–20 μm protein to a final concentration of 400 μm (2% final Me2SO) and the reaction was allowed to proceed on ice for 4 h. The reaction was then quenched with 0.4–1 mm DTT. Excess fluorophore was removed by gel filtering through a PD10 column followed by extensive dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. In some cases, the labeled protein was further subjected to chromatography on Mono-Q according to the procedure used to purify unlabeled protein. The extent of fluorophore labeling was determined from the ratio of NBD or dansyl absorbance to the protein absorbance at 280 nm with the latter corrected for the absorbance contribution of the fluorophore. Extinction coefficients of 25,000 m–1 cm–1 for NBD at 478 nm and 5700 m–1 cm–1 for dansyl at 330 nm were used for these calculations. Stoichiometry of CrmA-Protease Interactions—To a fixed concentration of protease (20–200 nm) was added varying concentrations of crmA up to an inhibitor/protease ratio ranging from 1 to 20. Following incubation at 25 °C for 60 min for granzyme B reactions and 5 min for caspase-1 reactions, residual enzyme activity was measured by addition of 25 μm YVAD-AMC or WEHD-AMC substrates in HSC buffer without sucrose but containing 5 mm DTT (caspase-1 reactions) or 50 μm IETD-AMC substrate in sodium phosphate buffer (granzyme B reactions). The initial rate of substrate hydrolysis was measured fluorimetrically using excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. Turnover numbers for substrate hydrolysis were calculated by calibrating the fluorometer with known concentrations of AMC product. Kinetics of CrmA-Protease Interactions—The kinetics of inhibition of caspase-1 by crmA were measured by continuous assays in which 0.1 nm caspase-1 was added to a solution of 5–500 nm crmA and 100 μm WEHD-AMC substrate in HSC buffer plus 5 mm DTT and the decrease in the rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored with time until a steady-state end point rate was reached. Inhibition progress curves were fit by a single exponential plus linear function to determine the observed pseudo first-order rate constant (kobs) for the inhibition reaction. Values for kobs were corrected for the competitive effect of the substrate by multiplying by the factor, 1 + [substrate]/Km, using a measured Km of 1.8 ± 0.1 μm for hydrolysis of the substrate under the same conditions (the Km determination employed substrate concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 30 Km). Inhibition of granzyme B by crmA was measured by incubating 20–100 nm enzyme with 500–600 nm inhibitor and removing aliquots at different times into 100 μm IETD-p-nitroanilide or 50 μm IETD-AMC substrates for spectrophotometric or fluorometric measurement of residual enzyme activity from the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 or 440 nm emission/380 nm excitation, respectively. Inactivation progress curves were fit by a single exponential decay function with zero end point to obtain kobs. Second-order rate constants for association of crmA and enzymes (ka) were obtained by dividing kobs by the crmA concentration. Fluorescence Perturbation Studies—Perturbation of the fluorescence of NBD-labeled crmAs by complexation with proteases or by reactive loop cleavage with AspN protease (Sigma) was assessed by excitation of 200–400 nm NBD-labeled crmA at 480 nm and measuring the emission spectrum between 500 and 600 nm in 5-nm steps (5–10-s integrations) with an SLM 8000 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence changes induced by a single addition of a 7% molar ratio of AspN/crmA or two successive additions of a 1.2-fold and then a ∼0.5-fold molar excess of granzyme B over crmA based on measured inhibition stoichiometries were continuously monitored at 540 nm to an end point value (1000–2000 s for completion of either AspN or granzyme B reactions) after which the emission spectrum was measured. The effects of reaction with caspase-1 were determined by titrating in substoichiometric levels of the enzyme and monitoring the fluorescence change after each addition for several minutes to yield a stable end point value. After no further fluorescence change was induced, a final emission spectrum was taken. For labeled crmAs that did not undergo significant changes in fluorescence upon reaction with proteases, the time allowed for complete reaction was based on the measured association rate constants. All spectra in a given experiment were taken at least twice and averaged. Background signal was subtracted by taking a buffer spectrum and all spectra taken after treatment with proteases were corrected for dilution (<10%). Experiments with each labeled crmA and protease were performed two or more times and after normalizing spectra by a factor yielding a value of 1 for the maximum fluorescence emission of native crmA, the results of independent experiments were averaged. FRET Studies—FRET between protease tryptophans (donor) and dansyl-labeled serpin (acceptor) due to complex formation was measured by taking emission spectra of 200 nm labeled serpin before and after protease treatment as in previous studies (15Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To selectively excite protein tryptophan residues and minimize tyrosine excitation, an excitation wavelength of 292 nm was used and spectra were taken from 300 to 600 nm. To control for any fluorescence changes of the acceptor fluorophore due to the serpin conformational change induced by protease reaction, the effect of AspN cleavage of the dansyl-labeled serpins on the emission spectrum was determined. Dansyl-labeled crmAs were reacted with a single addition of 7% AspN, with two successive additions of a molar excess of granzyme B over the serpin or several additions of caspase-1 from substoichiometric to a molar excess over the serpin based on the measured stoichiometry of inhibition (SI) as in the experiments with the NBD-crmAs. The time dependence of dansyl fluorescence changes due to protease treatment was continuously monitored at 500 nm to ensure completion of the reaction after each addition. When minimal fluorescence change was observed, sufficient time was allotted for reactions based on measured association rate constants. Corrections were made for the background buffer signal and sample dilution. Each emission spectrum obtained before and after treatment with protease was taken at least twice and at least two independent experiments with each labeled crmA and protease were performed and the spectra averaged after normalization, as with the NBD-crmA spectra. The effect of direct perturbation of the dansyl fluorophore in labeled crmAs by protease complexation was evaluated by exciting at 330 nm and scanning the fluorescence emission spectrum from 400 to 600 nm. Isolation of CrmA-Caspase-1 Complexes—Complexes of labeled crmAs with caspase-1 were formed by incubating 100–200 pmol of caspase-1 in HSC buffer plus 5 mm DTT with a sufficient molar excess of inhibitor over protease to result in complete protease inactivation (∼10% greater than the SI ratio). The reaction mixture was then injected onto a Superdex 200 column equilibrated and run with HSC buffer without sucrose as described previously (21Dobó J. Swanson R. Salvesen G.S. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38781-38790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Elution of crmA-protease complex and cleaved/unreacted crmA peaks was monitored by protein fluorescence detection using excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively. Peaks were pooled and concentrated and emission spectra of equivalent concentrations of complex and cleaved crmA peaks were compared with unreacted labeled crmA based on NBD or dansyl absorbance. ∼5 μg from each of the two peaks were rerun separately to assess the extent of any cross-contamination between peaks. CrmA-caspase-1 complex peaks were found to be 70–90% pure. Strategy for Mapping the Protease Interaction Site in CrmA-Protease Complexes—Single cysteine variants of recombinant crmA were engineered and site specifically labeled with fluorophore reporter groups for the purpose of mapping the position of the protease in crmA complexes with serine and cysteine proteases by fluorescence perturbation or FRET analyses. A set of five crmA variants were prepared by first mutating all nine cysteines of wild-type crmA to serine and then engineering single cysteines at positions 68, 101, 261, 298, and 304. The first three positions are equivalent to those previously used for labeling the serpin, α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI), to map the site of protease interaction in α1PI-trypsin complexes (15Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15582-15589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They are located on helix F (residue 101) and on two loops at the edge of sheet A most distal from the reactive loop, i.e. the strand 2A-helix E loop (residue 68) or the strand 5A-helix I loop (residue 261) (Fig. 1). The last two of the chosen positions, 298 and 304, correspond to the P6 and P1′ residues of the protease recognition sequence in the reactive center loop of the serpin and are normally cysteine. Thus, the preparation of these variants required changing only eight of the cysteine residues of the wild-type serpin to serine. The chosen sites provided reporter groups at or midway between the two poles of the serpin where serine proteases have been localized in initial docking and final covalent serpin-protease complexes (Fig. 1). Functional Properties of the CrmA Variants—The five single cysteine variants were all specifically labeled at near stoichiometric levels with iodoacetamido-NBD (IANBD) or iodoacetamidoethylamino-dansyl (IAEDANS) fluorophores (0.7–1 mol of fluorophore/mol of protein). The cysteine-free crmA variant retained an inhibitory activity toward the serine and cysteine protease targets, granzyme B and caspase-1, similar to that of the wild-type serpin (not shown), indicating that the cysteines were not important for activity. This finding was in keeping with the x-ray structure of the cysteine-free crmA variant showing that the modified cysteine residues are exposed on the protein surface and not in positions expected to form disulfide cross-links in the wild-type protein (22Simonovic M.

To date, policy recommendations addressing financial conflicts of interest have focused on the role of academic institutions in reviewing and overseeing investigator relationships with industry. However, investigators as a group determine the effectiveness of policies and practices. Therefore, there is a clear need for a consensus statement of standards for academia-industry interactions from the scientists' perspective. To meet that need, we propose conflict of interest guidelines for individual biomedical investigators to address the critical challenges faced when financial relationships with industry exist."
https://openalex.org/W2037054884,"The estrogen receptor (ER) signal transduction pathway is the primary target of the hormonal therapies used for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Interestingly, although animal studies performed over a century ago first suggested a link between the ovaries (estrogen production) and growth of breast tumors, definition of the molecular basis for this association and its pharmaceutical exploitation has occurred relatively recently. In the realm of breast cancer chemotherapy, compounds like tamoxifen have emerged which function as antiestrogens by directly blocking the binding of estrogen(s) to their receptors in breast tumors. The aromatase inhibitors, such as letrazole and anastrazole, inhibit estrogen production while high dose progestins attenuate ER signaling by an as yet unknown mechanism. Together, these hormonal therapies have been extremely successful and have improved both mortality and morbidity in this disease. However, as we begin to fully understand the complexities of estrogen signaling, it is clear that new classes of drugs that regulate important components of this signaling pathway are going to emerge that will increase the armamentarium of the oncologist and improve overall prognosis in this disease. Estrogen-containing medicines have been marketed in the United States for the relief of climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women since 1942 and for contraception since 1960. However, at the time of approval, little was known about the mechanism(s) underlying the biological responses to these drugs in target tissues. In the late 1950s, Elwood Jensen and colleagues identified a high affinity intracellular binding protein (now known as ER ) that was found only in estrogen-responsive tissues (1). This was followed some years later by work from Bert O’Malley’s group which demonstrated that ER was in fact a liganddependent transcription factor, whose actions dictated the cellular response to estrogens (2). These discoveries, and those of other investigators, in the early years of molecular endocrinology enabled the development of a simple model to describe the actions of estrogens in target cells, the essence of which has stood the test of time. Specifically, these models proposed that in the absence of hormone, ER resided in cells in an inactive form that underwent a biochemical “activating” event upon binding an estrogen. The agonist-bound ER was then capable of interacting with specific DNA sequences within the regulatory regions of target genes and positively or negatively regulating their transcription. By extension, it was proposed that antiestrogens, much like competitive enzyme antagonists, functioned by binding to the hormone-binding pocket of ER, thus blocking agonist access. Interestingly, there were early indications that this elegant model and proposed mechanism of action was over simplified and did not explain the full complexity of ER pharmacology. Notably, Harper and Walpole observed in their early studies of the antiestrogen tamoxifen that whereas it functioned as a potent antagonist of estrogen action in some organs, it manifested robust agonist activity in others (3). These observations were not followed up on to any great extent until the studies of Love et al. in 1992 revealed that tamoxifen, in the context of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, exhibited a paradoxical agonist activity in bone (4). Indeed, so dramatic were the results in these bone studies that it led to the rebirth of ER as a drug discovery target, this time for drugs useful for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Expectedly, the heightened interest in ER modulators for osteoporosis and the accompanying advancement in our understanding of estrogen action have also had a positive impact on the development of ER modulators for breast cancer. One of the most significant advances in drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying new ER modulators is the dramatic move in recent years from empirical to predictive mechanism-based drug screens. Traditionally, discovery programs for ER modulators used receptor-binding assays as a primary screen with the subsequent use of a “predictive” secondary assay to evaluate the relative activity of selected compounds in relevant endpoints. Compounds with desired properties were then assayed in animal models of the targeted disease for efficacy. Most, if not all, of the currently approved ER modulators emerged from programs that used this general methodology. For the identification of compounds"
