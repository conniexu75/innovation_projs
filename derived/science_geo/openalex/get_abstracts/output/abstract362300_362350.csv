https://openalex.org/W2046945705,"Higher growing season temperatures can have dramatic impacts on agricultural productivity, farm incomes, and food security. We used observational data and output from 23 global climate models to show a high probability (&gt;90%) that growing season temperatures in the tropics and subtropics by the end of the 21st century will exceed the most extreme seasonal temperatures recorded from 1900 to 2006. In temperate regions, the hottest seasons on record will represent the future norm in many locations. We used historical examples to illustrate the magnitude of damage to food systems caused by extreme seasonal heat and show that these short-run events could become long-term trends without sufficient investments in adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2075925574,"Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate neuronal communication at synapses throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. We have characterized a family of iGluR-related genes in Drosophila, which we name ionotropic receptors (IRs). These receptors do not belong to the well-described kainate, AMPA, or NMDA classes of iGluRs, and they have divergent ligand-binding domains that lack their characteristic glutamate-interacting residues. IRs are expressed in a combinatorial fashion in sensory neurons that respond to many distinct odors but do not express either insect odorant receptors (ORs) or gustatory receptors (GRs). IR proteins accumulate in sensory dendrites and not at synapses. Misexpression of IRs in different olfactory neurons is sufficient to confer ectopic odor responsiveness. Together, these results lead us to propose that the IRs comprise a novel family of chemosensory receptors. Conservation of IR/iGluR-related proteins in bacteria, plants, and animals suggests that this receptor family represents an evolutionarily ancient mechanism for sensing both internal and external chemical cues."
https://openalex.org/W2063084036,"Members of the sirtuin (SIRT) family of NAD-dependent deacetylases promote longevity in multiple organisms. Deficiency of mammalian SIRT6 leads to shortened life span and an aging-like phenotype in mice, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that SIRT6 functions at chromatin to attenuate NF-kappaB signaling. SIRT6 interacts with the NF-kappaB RELA subunit and deacetylates histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at NF-kappaB target gene promoters. In SIRT6-deficient cells, hyperacetylation of H3K9 at these target promoters is associated with increased RELA promoter occupancy and enhanced NF-kappaB-dependent modulation of gene expression, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Computational genomics analyses revealed increased activity of NF-kappaB-driven gene expression programs in multiple Sirt6-deficient tissues in vivo. Moreover, haploinsufficiency of RelA rescues the early lethality and degenerative syndrome of Sirt6-deficient mice. We propose that SIRT6 attenuates NF-kappaB signaling via H3K9 deacetylation at chromatin, and hyperactive NF-kappaB signaling may contribute to premature and normal aging."

We provide evidence that Stat3 is present in the mitochondria of cultured cells and primary tissues, including the liver and heart. In Stat3 â/â cells, the activities of complexes I and II of the electron transport chain (ETC) were significantly decreased. We identified Stat3 mutants that selectively restored the protein's function as a transcription factor or its functions within the ETC. In mice that do not express Stat3 in the heart, there were also selective defects in the activities of complexes I and II of the ETC. These data indicate that Stat3 is required for optimal function of the ETC, which may allow it to orchestrate responses to cellular homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1996764498,"Mitochondria are mobile organelles and cells regulate mitochondrial movement in order to meet the changing energy needs of each cellular region. Ca(2+) signaling, which halts both anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial motion, serves as one regulatory input. Anterograde mitochondrial movement is generated by kinesin-1, which interacts with the mitochondrial protein Miro through an adaptor protein, milton. We show that kinesin is present on all axonal mitochondria, including those that are stationary or moving retrograde. We also show that the EF-hand motifs of Miro mediate Ca(2+)-dependent arrest of mitochondria and elucidate the regulatory mechanism. Rather than dissociating kinesin-1 from mitochondria, Ca(2+)-binding permits Miro to interact directly with the motor domain of kinesin-1, preventing motor/microtubule interactions. Thus, kinesin-1 switches from an active state in which it is bound to Miro only via milton, to an inactive state in which direct binding to Miro prevents its interaction with microtubules. Disrupting Ca(2+)-dependent regulation diminishes neuronal resistance to excitotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2064964564,"Granulomas, organized aggregates of immune cells, form in response to persistent stimuli and are hallmarks of tuberculosis. Tuberculous granulomas have long been considered host-protective structures formed to contain infection. However, work in zebrafish infected with Mycobacterium marinum suggests that granulomas contribute to early bacterial growth. Here we use quantitative intravital microscopy to reveal distinct steps of granuloma formation and assess their consequence for infection. Intracellular mycobacteria use the ESX-1/RD1 virulence locus to induce recruitment of new macrophages to, and their rapid movement within, nascent granulomas. This motility enables multiple arriving macrophages to efficiently find and phagocytose infected macrophages undergoing apoptosis, leading to rapid, iterative expansion of infected macrophages and thereby bacterial numbers. The primary granuloma then seeds secondary granulomas via egress of infected macrophages. Our direct observations provide insight into how pathogenic mycobacteria exploit the granuloma during the innate immune phase for local expansion and systemic dissemination."
https://openalex.org/W2098854209,"The mammalian innate immune system is activated by foreign nucleic acids. Detection of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the cytoplasm triggers characteristic antiviral responses and macrophage cell death. Cytoplasmic dsDNA rapidly activated caspase 3 and caspase 1 in bone marrow–derived macrophages. We identified the HIN-200 family member and candidate lupus susceptibility factor, p202, as a dsDNA binding protein that bound stably and rapidly to transfected DNA. Knockdown studies showed p202 to be an inhibitor of DNA-induced caspase activation. Conversely, the related pyrin domain–containing HIN-200 factor, AIM2 (p210), was required for caspase activation by cytoplasmic dsDNA. This work indicates that HIN-200 proteins can act as pattern recognition receptors mediating responses to cytoplasmic dsDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2018374043,"An RNA enzyme that catalyzes the RNA-templated joining of RNA was converted to a format whereby two enzymes catalyze each other's synthesis from a total of four oligonucleotide substrates. These cross-replicating RNA enzymes undergo self-sustained exponential amplification in the absence of proteins or other biological materials. Amplification occurs with a doubling time of about 1 hour and can be continued indefinitely. Populations of various cross-replicating enzymes were constructed and allowed to compete for a common pool of substrates, during which recombinant replicators arose and grew to dominate the population. These replicating RNA enzymes can serve as an experimental model of a genetic system. Many such model systems could be constructed, allowing different selective outcomes to be related to the underlying properties of the genetic system."
https://openalex.org/W2110272715,"The assembly of the Smad complex is critical for TGFbeta signaling, yet the mechanisms that inactivate or empower nuclear Smad complexes are less understood. By means of siRNA screen we identified FAM (USP9x), a deubiquitinase acting as essential and evolutionarily conserved component in TGFbeta and bone morphogenetic protein signaling. Smad4 is monoubiquitinated in lysine 519 in vivo, a modification that inhibits Smad4 by impeding association with phospho-Smad2. FAM reverts this negative modification, re-empowering Smad4 function. FAM opposes the activity of Ectodermin/Tif1gamma (Ecto), a nuclear factor for which we now clarify a prominent role as Smad4 monoubiquitin ligase. Our study points to Smad4 monoubiquitination and deubiquitination as a way for cells to set their TGFbeta responsiveness: loss of FAM disables Smad4-dependent responses in several model systems, with Ecto being epistatic to FAM. This defines a regulative ubiquitination step controlling Smads that is parallel to those impinging on R-Smad phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2143240348,"In plants, G proteins modulate signaling by the stress hormone, abscisic acid (ABA). We identify and characterize two novel Arabidopsis proteins that show homology to an orphan vertebrate GPCR (GPR89) and interact with the sole Arabidopsis G protein α subunit, GPA1, but also have intrinsic GTP-binding and GTPase activity. We have named these proteins GPCR-type G proteins (GTG1 and GTG2). Arabidopsis mutants lacking both GTG1 and GTG2 exhibit ABA hyposensitivity. GTG1 and GTG2 bind ABA specifically. The GDP-bound form of the GTGs exhibits greater ABA binding than the GTP-bound form, the GTPase activity of the GTGs is inhibited by GPA1, and gpa1 null mutants exhibit ABA-hypersensitive phenotypes. These results predict that, unusually, it is the GDP-bound, not the GTP-bound, form of the GTGs that actively relays the signal. We propose that GTG proteins function both as a new type of G protein and as a class of membrane-localized ABA receptors.

We propose that GTG proteins function both as a new type of G protein and as a class of membrane-localized ABA receptors. Signal transduction processes mediated by G protein signaling components constitute one of the most elaborate receptor-effector signaling networks (Offermanns, 2003Offermanns S. G-proteins as transducers in transmembrane signalling.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The central components of this network are heterotrimeric G proteins, comprised of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The Gα subunit has both GTP-binding and GTPase activity and acts as a bimodal molecular switch, typically with a GDP-bound “off” mode and a GTP-bound “on” mode. GPCRs classically act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and a change in GPCR conformation upon signal perception leads to exchange of GDP for GTP at the Gα subunit. This promotes dissociation of the heterotrimer into free GTP-Gα and Gβγ dimers, both of which can interact with an array of downstream signaling elements. The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα regenerates its GDP-bound form, permitting reassociation with the Gβγ dimer and completing the cycle (Cabrera-Vera et al., 2003Cabrera-Vera T.M. Vanhauwe J. Thomas T.O. Medkova M. Preininger A. Mazzoni M.R. Hamm H.E. Insights into G protein structure, function, and regulation.Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 765-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Accessory proteins also regulate the G protein cycle, most prominently the GTPase-accelerating proteins (GAPs) exemplified by RGS (regulators of G protein signaling) proteins (Ross, 2008Ross E.M. Coordinating speed and amplitude in G-protein signaling.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R777-R783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins that primarily inhibit dissociation of GDP from Gα. Diversity in mammalian G protein signaling is achieved by a large combinatorial repertoire of G protein signaling components and the range of effectors with which they interact. In human, there are 23 Gα, 5 Gβ, and 12 Gγ subunit proteins and >800 predicted GPCRs, generating a multitude of receptor-G protein combinations (Offermanns, 2003Offermanns S. G-proteins as transducers in transmembrane signalling.Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 101-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Fungi and plants, however, have limited numbers of G protein components. The genome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains one prototypical Gα (GPA1), one Gβ (AGB1), and two identified Gγ (AGG1 and AGG2) subunits (Jones and Assmann, 2004Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Plants: the latest model system for G-protein research.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and one RGS protein, AtRGS1 (Chen et al., 2003Chen J.G. Willard F.S. Huang J. Liang J. Chasse S.A. Jones A.M. Siderovski D.P. A seven-transmembrane RGS protein that modulates plant cell proliferation.Science. 2003; 301: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). GCR1 is the best characterized GPCR-like protein in Arabidopsis (Pandey and Assmann, 2004Pandey S. Assmann S.M. The Arabidopsis putative G protein-coupled receptor GCR1 interacts with the G protein α subunit GPA1 and regulates abscisic acid signaling.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1616-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), although no ligand has yet been identified for it. Despite the paucity of components, G proteins are involved in numerous fundamental growth and developmental processes in plants (Assmann, 2004Assmann S.M. Plant G proteins, phytohormones, and plasticity: three questions and a speculation.Sci. STKE. 2004; 264: re20Google Scholar). There is also evidence suggesting that plants have evolved a scheme with added temporal and spatial aspects that allows a limited number of G protein components to act as nodes for integration and amplification of a host of abiotic, biotic, and hormonal signals (Assmann, 2004Assmann S.M. Plant G proteins, phytohormones, and plasticity: three questions and a speculation.Sci. STKE. 2004; 264: re20Google Scholar). Based on phenotypic analyses of null mutants, G proteins modulate almost all aspects of ABA signaling in plants (Wang et al., 2001Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M.

While biochemical evidence supports the presence of both cell-surface and intracellular receptor(s) for ABA (reviewed in Assmann, 1994Assmann S.M. Ins and outs of guard cell ABA receptors.Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1187-1190Google Scholar), a direct receptor-effector signaling module regulated by G proteins during ABA signaling has remained elusive. The intracellular ABA-binding proteins, FCA and CHLH (Razem et al., 2006Razem F.A. El-Kereamy A. Abrams S.R. Hill R.D.

Yue Y. Li B. Nie Y. Li W. Wu W.H. Ma L. A G protein-coupled receptor is a plasma membrane receptor for the plant hormone abscisic acid.Science. 2007; 315: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) seems to be incorrect in its conclusion that GCR2 harbors transmembrane domains (Illingworth et al., 2008Illingworth C.J.

Comment on “A G protein coupled receptor is a plasma membrane receptor for the plant hormone abscisic acid.”.Science. 2007; 318: 914Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, ABA-related phenotypes are mild to absent in gcr2 mutants (Gao et al., 2007Gao Y. Zeng Q. Guo J. Cheng J. Ellis B.E. Chen J.G. Genetic characterization reveals no role for the reported ABA receptor, GCR2, in ABA control of seed germination and early seedling development in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2007; 52: 1001-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2008Guo J. Zeng Q. Emami M. Ellis B.E. Chen J.G. The GCR2 gene family is not required for ABA control of seed germination and early seedling development in Arabidopsis.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e2982https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002982Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Such data suggest that important ABA receptors in plants remain to be identified. Additional GPCR-like proteins exist in plants (Gookin et al., 2008Gookin T.E. Kim J. Assmann S.M. Whole proteome identification of plant candidate G-protein coupled receptors in Arabidopsis, rice, and poplar: computational prediction and in-vivo protein coupling.Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R120Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar and references therein). Our in silico analyses identified two new GPCR-like proteins in Arabidopsis, At1g64990 and At4g27630, that show extensive sequence homology to a human orphan receptor, GPR89, but also have some unique features. In addition to a predicted GPCR-like topology and sequence similarity to GPR89, both proteins also have a predicted ATP-/GTP-binding domain and a degenerate GTPase-activating protein domain. We have named these proteins GPCR-type G proteins 1 and 2 (GTG1 and GTG2). We find that the GTG proteins exemplify a novel class of proteins with topology similar to GPCRs but with classic GTP-binding/GTPase activity. We provide biochemical and phenotypic evidence that GTG1 and GTG2 proteins are redundantly involved in G protein-coupled ABA signaling and are, or are parts of, ABA receptor complexes. GTG1 (At1g64990) and GTG2 (At4g27630) show 90% amino acid sequence identity with each other and 45% identity and 68% similarity with GPR89. The similarity extends throughout the length of the proteins (Figure 1A). BLAST analysis identifies close homologs of these proteins in monocot and dicot plants, vertebrates, invertebrates, fungi, and unicellular organisms. The Arabidopsis GTG proteins show about 80% identity and 90% similarity at the amino acid level with their plant homologs, whereas 40%–45% sequence identity and 60%–70% sequence similarity are observed with vertebrate and nonvertebrate animals. Lower homology is observed with fungi and unicellular organisms (about 20% identity and 40% similarity). To assess the evolutionary relationship between these proteins we performed a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 1B). Plants form a separate clade from other organisms and the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas groups with the other lower organisms, suggesting a possible sequence divergence when unicellular and multicellular organisms diverged. PROSITE motif analysis (http://www.expasy.ch/prosite/) identified a conserved ATP-/GTP-binding region in GTG1 and GTG2 (Figure 1A, region 382–411 for GTG1). This motif is highly conserved in all the plant proteins; however the similarity with non-plant proteins is relatively low with little conservation of the first nine amino acids at the junction of the predicted 4th intracellular loop. The polar charged glutamic acid at position 396 of GTG1 is conserved in all plant species but is replaced by a neutral, uncharged amide (glutamine) in the non-plant proteins. The large third intracellular loop of GTG1 and GTG2 also has a region showing similarity to the degenerate Ras GTPase-activating protein domain ([GSNA]-x-[LIVMF]-[FYCI]-[LIVMFY]-R-[LIVMFY](2)-[GACNS]-[PAV]-[AV]-[LIV]-[LIVM]-[SGANT]-P) with 68% and 62% similarity, respectively (amino acids 230–243 in GTG1). This region also shows high sequence conservation in all the plant proteins analyzed but is divergent elsewhere. Both GTG1 and GTG2 have nine predicted transmembrane domains, similar to human GPR89 (Figure 1C; Table S3 available online). As anticipated, the FLAG epitope-tagged versions of both GTG1 and GTG2 proteins are detected mostly in the total microsomal fractions isolated from transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Figure 1D). Transient expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts shows localization of GFP-tagged GTG1 and GTG2 at the cell periphery (Figure 1E). Purified recombinant GTG1, GTG2 (Figure S1), and GPR89 proteins were analyzed for GTP-binding and GTPase activity using a real-time assay based on BODIPY-GTPγS or BODIPY-GTP, in which fluorescence increases upon binding of the fluorescently labeled nucleotide and decreases upon GTP hydrolysis (Willard et al., 2005Willard F.S. Kimple A.J. Johnston C.A. Siderovski D.P. A direct fluorescence-based assay for RGS domain GTPase accelerating activity.Anal. Biochem. 2005; 340: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We first validated this method using commercially available bovine G protein (Figures 2A and 2B). As expected, the bovine protein showed specific binding of a nonhydrolyzable GTP, BODIPY-GTPγS, that could be competed with unlabeled GTP or GDP but not with unlabeled ADP (Figure 2A). The bovine G protein also showed GTPase activity against BODIPY-GTP that was competed by unlabeled GDP or GTP but not by unlabeled ADP (Figure 2B). We then analyzed the Arabidopsis GTG proteins and human GPR89 for GTP binding and hydrolysis. GTG1 and GTG2 both show specific GTP binding that could be efficiently competed by nonfluorescent GDP or GTP but not by ADP (Figures 2C and 2E). Confirming binding specificity, both GTG proteins showed efficient binding with BODIPY-GDP, which could be competed with nonfluorescent GTP but not with nonfluorescent ATP. No binding with BODIPY-ATP or effect of ATP on BODIPY-GTP binding were observed (Figures S2 and S3). GTP binding was also independently confirmed by [35S]GTPγS-binding assays (Figure S6C). The GTG proteins also show GTPase activity (Figures 2D and 2F). We independently confirmed their GTPase activity by assaying the production of free Pi using the ENZchek phosphate assay kit (Figure S4) and by quantification of [32P]GTP hydrolysis using thin-layer chromatography (Figure S6B). The GTPase activity of the two GTG proteins is Mg2+ dependent as the presence of 2 mM EDTA (free Mg2+ concentration 0.8 mM) abolished GTPase activity (Figures 2D, 2F, and S5), and it has a broad pH optimum (Figure S6). Recombinant human GPR89 did not exhibit GTP binding or GTPase activity under our assay conditions (Figures 2D and S4). Together, these assays firmly establish that the newly identified GTG1 and GTG2 proteins have specific GTP-binding and GTPase activity, hallmarks of signaling G proteins. To evaluate the in planta functions of the GTGs, we first analyzed their expression patterns. Quantitative PCR analysis showed widespread expression of both GTG genes (Figure 3A). These results were corroborated by GUS reporter gene analysis. GUS staining was observed in all plant organs analyzed: cotyledons, leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and guard cells (Figures 3B and 3C). GTG1 and GTG2 transcript levels did not change after treatment with ABA or different abiotic stresses (Figure 3D; analysis of AtGenExpress microarray data [not shown]). We pursued a reverse genetic approach to decipher GTG1 and GTG2 protein functions in planta. Single T-DNA insertional mutants (gtg1-1 and gtg2-1) were isolated for each gene (Figure 4A). RT-PCR using the primer combinations 1P1+1P4 and 2P4+2P5, which flank the insertion sites, confirmed the absence of full-length transcripts (Figures 4B, 4C, and S7). The single mutants were used to generate the gtg1-1 gtg2-1 double mutant (henceforth referred to as gtg1 gtg2). PCR with primer combinations P1+P2 and P3+P4 revealed that reduced levels of a truncated transcript could be detected for both GTG1 and GTG2 upstream of the insertion (Figure S7). To confirm that phenotypes of the gtg1 gtg2 mutants are indeed due to GTG mutation, the double mutant was complemented with full-length GTG1 or GTG2 genes. For each gene, complementation was performed with two types of constructs: N- or C-terminal fusions with the FLAG epitope tag. Multiple transgenic lines were obtained for each construct and showed different levels of fusion protein expression (e.g., Figure 4D). For each gene, two independent lines of each of N- and C-terminal FLAG fusions (four lines total per gene), one showing moderate expression (e.g., #1 in upper and lower panels of Figure 4D) and the other showing higher expression (e.g., #4 in upper and lower panels of Figure 4D) were analyzed (see also Figures S8–S12). While the phenotypes of single gtg mutant plants were indistinguishable from wild-type, the double gtg1 gtg2 mutant exhibited significant differences, related mostly to ABA signaling, both at early and adult stages. In all assays, the gtg1 gtg2 mutant phenotype could be fully complemented with introduction of either the GTG1 or the GTG2 genes, implying redundancy in GTG function. No complementation was observed with the empty vector. Complemented lines with either N- or C-terminal FLAG epitope fusions showed similar results (Figures 4D, 5, and S8–S12). The gtg1 gtg2 mutant showed hyposensitivity to ABA in seed germination and post-germination growth assays. On 1 μM ABA, only about 50% of the wild-type Wassilewskija (Ws) seeds germinated whereas the germination percentage of gtg1 gtg2 mutant seeds was ∼80% (Figure 5A). About 40% germination was obtained with 2 μM ABA for gtg1 gtg2 mutants, an ABA concentration at which no wild-type seeds germinated (Figures 5A and S8). The effect of ABA on post-germination growth of seedlings was analyzed by scoring percentages of germinated seeds forming green cotyledons at 1 μM ABA (Chen and Jones, 2004Chen J.G. Jones A.M. AtRGS1 function in Arabidopsis thaliana.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 389: 338-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). All gtg1 gtg2 seedlings formed green cotyledons at this ABA concentration, whereas only about 60% of Ws or gtg single mutants developed green cotyledons (Figure 5B). The same trend was obtained for inhibition of primary root length by ABA. The gtg1 gtg2 mutants showed less sensitivity to ABA, with only ∼15% inhibition in root length at 20 μM ABA, a concentration sufficient to cause almost 40% inhibition of root length in Ws, single gtg1 or gtg2 mutants, and gtg1 gtg2 mutant complemented with either GTG1 or GTG2 (Figures 5E and S9). ABA-induced gene expression was also significantly compromised in the gtg1 gtg2 mutants, as determined by quantification of the transcript levels of a number of ABA-induced marker genes (Figures 5F and S10). For ABA induction of stomatal closure the gtg1 gtg2 mutant plants were significantly ABA hyposensitive, exhibiting only a 17% decrease in stomatal aperture as compared to an ∼40% decrease in wild-type plants (Figures 5G and S11); however, ABA inhibition of stomatal opening remained similar to wild-type (Figures 5H and S12). The adult gtg1 gtg2 mutant plants are smaller, have a mildly stressed appearance, and flower earlier than wild-type plants (Figures 5C and 5D). The endogenous ABA level in the double mutant plants is comparable to that of wild-type (Figure S13). We also analyzed the transcript levels of other reported ABA receptors in the gtg1 gtg2 mutant, to evaluate the possibility that the ABA hyposensitive phenotypes are due to lower expression of those receptors. No differences in transcript levels of FCA, CHLH, or GCR2 could be detected in the gtg1 gtg2 mutants as compared to wild-type (Figure S14). The GTG1 and GTG2 proteins were initially identified based on their similarity to an orphan GPCR. One of the signature properties of GPCRs is their interaction with G proteins; therefore, we evaluated the interaction of GTG proteins with the sole canonical Arabidopsis Gα subunit, GPA1. Both GTG1 and GTG2 interacted with GPA1 in the split ubiquitin system, designed to assess interaction of membrane proteins (Pandey and Assmann, 2004Pandey S. Assmann S.M. The Arabidopsis putative G protein-coupled receptor GCR1 interacts with the G protein α subunit GPA1 and regulates abscisic acid signaling.Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1616-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Interaction of GPA1-CUb with GTG1- and GTG2-NUb fusions (in both orientations) was observed (Figure 6A) under very high-stringency conditions (1 mM methionine). Additional results and controls are presented in Table S1. We verified this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation. Total microsomal or soluble fractions from wild-type or gtg1 gtg2 mutant plants expressing FLAG-tagged GTG1 or GTG2 were immunoprecipitated with FLAG antibodies and probed with GPA1 antibodies. The GPA1 protein could be detected in the total microsomal fractions but not in the soluble fractions nor in the immunoprecipitated proteins from wild-type plants (Figure 6B). Since GTG1 and GTG2 have G protein activity of their own, we elucidated whether interaction with GPA1 affects the GTP-binding and GTPase activity of the GTG proteins. The GTP-binding activity of the GTG1 and GTG2 proteins is accelerated by GPA1 and, remarkably, their GTPase activity is strongly inhibited (Figure 6C). To confirm that the reduced total GTPase activity is an effect of GPA1 on GTG activity and not vice versa, we used a mutant form of GPA1 (Q222L GPA1), predicted to have normal GTP binding but lack GTPase activity due to the mutation of its conserved GTPase domain (Ullah et al., 2003Ullah H. Chen J.G. Temple B. Boyes D.C. Alonso J.M. Davis K.R. Ecker J.R. Jones A.M. The β-subunit of the Arabidopsis G protein negatively regulates auxin-induced cell division and affects multiple developmental processes.Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Our assays with BODIPY-GTP and α32P-GTP experimentally demonstrate that Q222L GPA1 indeed lacks GTPase activity, and therefore we designate it as constitutively active GPA1 (CaGPA1) (Figures 6D and S6B). Remarkably, the presence of CaGPA1 blocks the GTPase activity of the GTG proteins, confirming that the GTP-bound form of GPA1 inhibits the GTPase activity of GTG proteins. The G protein activity and GPCR-like topology of GTG proteins along with the significantly ABA hyposensitive phenotypes of gtg1 gtg2 mutants led to the intriguing possibility that the GTG proteins constitute all or part of an unusual class of G protein-coupled ABA perception complex(es). To test this possibility, we carried out direct ABA-binding assays with 3H-ABA and purified recombinant GTG proteins. Both GTG1 and GTG2 proteins showed saturable and specific 3H-ABA binding, with apparent KD (dissociation constant) values of 35.8 nM and 41.2 nM, respectively (Figure 7A). GTG proteins did not bind 3H-benzoic acid, another weak acid used as a negative control. The ABA binding of GTG1 and GTG2 could be effectively competed with unlabeled biologically active (±)-ABA, but not by the biologically inactive (−)-ABA isomer (Figure 7B). Following the implication that the GTG proteins do not bind the (−)-ABA isomer, the above KD values would then be halved. No 3H-ABA binding was observed when BSA or GPA1 was used as a control for nonspecific binding (Figures 7A and 7C). AtRGS1, which, like the GTG proteins, is a predicted multitransmembrane domain protein (Chen et al., 2003Chen J.G. Willard F.S. Huang J. Liang J. Chasse S.A. Jones A.M. Siderovski D.P. A seven-transmembrane RGS protein that modulates plant cell proliferation.Science. 2003; 301: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), was evaluated as a further control for nonspecific binding. In contrast to the GTG proteins, AtRGS1 showed low levels of nonspecific ABA binding (data not shown). Both GTG1 and GTG2 showed more efficient ABA binding in the presence of GDP, as compared to binding in the presence of GTP or ATP (Figure 7C). The presence of GPA1 (in the presence of GDP; thus presumably GDP-bound) did not affect ABA binding (Figure 7D). GPA1 alone showed no ABA binding (Figure 7D). Additionally, the presence of EDTA, which inhibits GTPase activity of the GTG proteins (Figures 2D and 2F), also abolished ABA binding (Figure 7D), consistent with the observation that GTP-GTG proteins bind ABA more weakly than GDP-GTG proteins (Figure 7C). Heat-denatured GTG proteins do not show ABA binding (Figure 7D). These results thus substantiate the specific ABA binding by GTG proteins. The observed stoichiometry of binding is low in these experiments (∼0.01 mol ABA/mol protein) probably due to nonoptimal conditions of protein purification, solubilization, and renaturation. Since the expression and purification of GPCRs (and proteins with multitransmembrane domains in general) in heterologous systems remains one of the biggest challenges in the field (Lundstrom et al., 2006Lundstrom K. Wagner R. Reinhart C. Desmyter A. Cherouati N. Magnin T. Zeder-Lutz G. Courtot M. Prural C.

Expression of recombinant G-protein coupled receptors for structural biology.Mol. Biosyst. 2007; 3: 723-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), further experiments are needed to find the optimal system for expression and purification of active GTG proteins. Optimized conditions, especially with respect to the lipid environment, detergent concentration plus other renaturation conditions, and posttranslational modifications will help in more accurate determination of the stoichiometry. In contrast to the extensive G protein repertoires of vertebrates, the few G protein components in plants seem to have evolved as central nodes, integrating multiple signals and essentially “modulating” the response. Such a role for plant G proteins is consistent with the observation that Arabidopsis plants harboring mutations in Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits exhibit altered degrees of hormone sensitivity (hyposensitivity or hypersensitivity) but do not exhibit a complete lack of hormone sensitivity (Ullah et al., 2003Ullah H. Chen J.G. Temple B. Boyes D.C. Alonso J.M. Davis K.R. Ecker J.R. Jones A.M.

G-protein complex mutants are hypersensitive to abscisic acid regulation of germination and postgermination development.Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The limited number of canonical G proteins in plants is also possibly compensated for by the presence of some unique proteins, e.g., the XLG proteins that have a C-terminal region homologous to GPA1 but a unique, plant-specific N-terminal half (Ding et al., 2008Ding L. Pandey S. Assmann S.M. Arabidopsis extra-large G proteins (XLGs) regulate root morphogenesis.Plant J. 2008; 53: 248-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and the AtRGS1 protein that has a C-terminal RGS domain and an N-terminal GPCR-like domain (Chen et al., 2003Chen J.G. Willard F.S. Huang J. Liang J. Chasse S.A. Jones A.M. Siderovski D.P. A seven-transmembrane RGS protein that modulates plant cell proliferation.Science. 2003; 301: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The newly discovered GTG proteins with GPCR-like topology (Figure 1) and GTPase activity provide an additional novel dimension to G protein signaling. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a GPCR-like G protein. The GTG proteins exhibit all basic characteristics of signaling G proteins: reversible binding with GTP and GDP but not with ATP or ADP (Figures 2 and S2), GTPase activity, and requirement for Mg2+. A few other proteins that combine GTPase activity with additional unique functional or structural domains are known, e.g., the yeast Fzo1p is a mitochondrial membrane-localized, transmembrane GTPase involved in membrane fusion (Hermann et al., 1998Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Mitochondrial fusion in yeast requires the transmembrane GTPase Fzo1p.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 359-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and the bacterial FeoB is a seven-transmembrane transporter that mediates GTPase-dependent iron uptake in bacteria (Marlovits et al., 2003Marlovits T.C.

Our study reveals a previously unsuspected function of Microprocessor in mRNA stability control. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nt small noncoding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through translational inhibition and destabilization of their target mRNAs (Ambros et al., 2003Ambros V. Bartel B. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Carrington J.C. Chen X. Dreyfuss G. Eddy S.R. Griffiths-Jones S.

Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs: are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3856) Google Scholar). MiRNAs were initially discovered from C. elegans, as regulatory molecules modulating the developmental timing (Lee et al., 1993Lee R.C. Feinbaum R.L. Ambros V.

Hundreds of miRNAs have been discovered in most eukaryotic species, and their diverse roles are rapidly being elucidated (Bushati and Cohen, 2007Bushati N. Cohen S.M. microRNA functions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar, Jones-Rhoades et al., 2006Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Bartel B. MicroRNAS and their regulatory roles in plants.Annu.

Links between miRNA and human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases have also been established (Bushati and Cohen, 2007Bushati N. Cohen S.M. microRNA functions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). MiRNAs originate from long primary transcripts called pri-miRNAs (Lee et al., 2002Lee Y. Jeon K. Lee J.T. Kim S. Kim V.N. MicroRNA maturation: stepwise processing and subcellular localization.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4663-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). The hairpin embedded in pri-miRNA is processed in the nucleus by Drosha, a member of ribonuclease III family (RNase III), and converted into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) (Lee et al., 2003Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. et al.The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). This processing is crucial for the vast majority of miRNAs, although a small subgroup of miRNAs found in short introns can bypass this step (Okamura et al., 2007Okamura K. Hagen J.W. Duan H. Tyler D.M. Lai E.C. The mirtron pathway generates microRNA-class regulatory RNAs in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 130: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C.H. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The pre-miRNA is then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5 and turned into ∼22 nt miRNA duplex by Dicer, another RNase III protein (Liu et al., 2008Liu X. Fortin K. Mourelatos Z. MicroRNAs: biogenesis and molecular functions.Brain Pathol. 2008; 18: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One strand of the miRNA duplex is incorporated into an effector complex known as RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Liu et al., 2008Liu X. Fortin K. Mourelatos Z. MicroRNAs: biogenesis and molecular functions.Brain Pathol. 2008; 18: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Drosha has two RNase III domains and one double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD). The two RNase III domains (RIIIDa and RIIIDb) form an intramolecular dimer and cleave the 3′ and 5′ strands of the stem, respectively (Han et al., 2004Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Because the dsRBD of Drosha is insufficient for substrate binding, Drosha needs a partner protein surrogating the RNA recognition function. DGCR8 (also known as Pasha) is the cofactor that interacts with Drosha and forms a functional complex called the “Microprocessor” (Denli et al., 2004Denli A.M. Tops B.B. Plasterk R.H. Ketting R.F.

Biol. 2004; 14: 2162-2167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). DGCR8 contains two dsRBDs and recognizes the unique features of the pri-miRNA, which include the ssRNA segments flanking a stem of appropriate length (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). DGCR8 anchors at the ssRNA-dsRNA junction and directs Drosha to cleave ∼11 bp away from the junction (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of Microprocessor activity has been intensively interrogated, it remains largely unknown how its components are regulated. In a comparative genomics study, Pedersen et al. predicted a couple of conserved hairpins in DGCR8 mRNA, whose folds are similar to pri-miRNA structure, which implied that the hairpins may be involved in the autoregulation of DGCR8 (Pedersen et al., 2006Pedersen J.S. Bejerano G. Siepel A. Rosenbloom K. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kent J. Miller W. Haussler D. Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). A possible link between DGCR8 and heme-mediated signal transduction pathway was also proposed on the basis of the finding that DGCR8 is a heme-binding protein (Faller et al., 2007Faller M. Matsunaga M. Yin S. Loo J.A. Guo F. Heme is involved in microRNA processing.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). When Microprocessor activity is dysregulated, the miRNA pool is altered, disrupting the normal cellular function. For instance, Dgcr8 knockout mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells do not produce miRNAs with resulting defects in proliferation or differentiation (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in various human cancers, miRNA expression was found to be generally suppressed (Lu et al., 2005Lu J. Getz G. Miska E.A. Alvarez-Saavedra E. Lamb J. Peck D. Sweet-Cordero A. Ebert B.L. Mak R.H. Ferrando A.A. et al.MicroRNA expression profiles classify human cancers.Nature. 2005; 435: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (7740) Google Scholar), implicating that precise control of miRNA biogenesis may be critical in guarding the cells against malignancy. It was proposed that Drosha processing of certain miRNAs is suppressed in tumor cells and undifferentiated cells (Thomson et al., 2006Thomson J.M. Newman M. Parker J.S. Morin-Kensicki E.M. Wright T. Hammond S.M. Extensive post-transcriptional regulation of microRNAs and its implications for cancer.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of the suppression remains unclear. In the present study, we show that DGCR8 is negatively regulated by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex through mRNA cleavage. We further report that DGCR8 positively regulates Drosha by protein stabilization. These auto- and crossregulations between Drosha and DGCR8 may help maintain the homeostatic control of miRNA biogenesis. To study the function of Drosha in pri-miRNA processing, we routinely use RNAi technique to deplete Drosha in HeLa cells and analyze RNA by RT-PCR and northern blotting. While performing these RNAi experiments, we observed that the DGCR8 mRNA level increased significantly in Drosha-depleted cells (Figure 1A). Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed ∼3 fold increase in the DGCR8 mRNA level under this condition. As with the mRNA level, the DGCR8 protein level also increased 3- to 4-fold after Drosha knockdown, as determined by western blotting (Figure 1B). To exclude the possibility that this is caused by off-target effects, we used a transdominant negative Drosha mutant (TN Drosha) containing point mutations in both RNase III domains. When this mutant protein was overexpressed, Drosha processing of pri-miRNA was effectively blocked (Figure 1C and Figure S1A available online). The DGCR8 mRNA level increased under this condition (Figure 1C, lane 3), whereas it decreased when wild-type Drosha was overexpressed (Figure 1C, lane 2). In accordance with the mRNA level, endogenous DGCR8 protein accumulated after TN Drosha overexpression (Figure 1C, lane 6, and Figure S1A). A similar experiment was carried out with a transdominant negative DGCR8 mutant (Figure S1B). The mutant called mDRBD1&2 DGCR8 (m1&2) contains point mutations in both dsRBDs (Yeom et al., 2006Yeom K.H. Lee Y. Han J. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. Characterization of DGCR8/Pasha, the essential cofactor for Drosha in primary miRNA processing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4622-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Expression of this DGCR8 mutant upregulated the endogenous DGCR8 mRNA (Figure S1B, lane 4), suggesting that it is the reduction of the wild-type Drosha-DGCR8 activity that is responsible for the accumulation of DGCR8 mRNA. To unravel the mechanism of this regulation, we first determined the RNA polymerase density on DGCR8 gene by nuclear runoff assay. For this experiment, a HeLa cell line that expresses pri-miR-30a from the tetracycline-inducible promoter was used. The inducible pri-miR-30a gene was used as a control for a differentially transcribed gene. Polymerase density on DGCR8 did not change after Drosha knockdown (Figure 1D), despite the increase of the steady-state level of the DGCR8 mRNA (Figure S2A), which indicated that the regulation of DGCR8 may occur posttranscriptionally. To be certain of this result, we performed qRT-PCR to amplify the intronic region of the DGCR8 pre-mRNA using a primer set that bind to the first intron (Figure 1A). Knockdown of Drosha had no effect on the DGCR8 pre-mRNA level (DGCR8 first intron), whereas it dramatically increased the mature DGCR8 mRNA level (DGCR8 CDS). This was also confirmed by RT-PCR with a different primer set that amplifies the first intron (Int1-Int1) (Figure S2B). Thus, the DGCR8 mRNA is likely to be regulated by Drosha after transcription and splicing of the first intron. To examine whether Drosha affects the stability of the DGCR8 mRNA, we measured the turnover rate of the mRNA after blocking transcription by treating the cells with actinomycin D (ActD) (Figure 1E and Figure S3). HEK293T cells were first transfected with siRNA and then treated with ActD 40 hr later. Total RNA was subsequently prepared on several time points and analyzed by northern blotting. The DGCR8 mRNA prepared from Drosha-depleted cells was more stable than that from control cells (Figure 1E and Figure S3A). The RT-PCR analysis with RNAs prepared from similarly treated cells confirmed that the half-life of DGCR8 mRNA was lengthened upon Drosha depletion (Figure S3B). Pri-miR-21 and GAPDH transcripts served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Because the DGCR8 3′ untranslated region (UTR) is predicted to possess several miRNA target sites, it is conceivable that mRNA destabilization is caused by RISC-associated miRNAs. To test this possibility, we depleted Dicer, which is another essential factor for miRNA biogenesis. The reduction of Dicer did not increase the protein level of DGCR8 under this condition, excluding the possibility that the observed suppression of DGCR8 is mediated by RISC-associated miRNA (Figure 1B). Accordingly, the mRNA level of DGCR8 did not increase in Dicer-depleted cells, as determined by RT-PCR (Figure 1F). Effective depletion of Dicer was confirmed by strong induction of the p27 protein that is a known target of miR-221/222 (Figure 1B) (Visone et al., 2007Visone R. Russo L. Pallante P. De Martino I. Ferraro A. Leone V. Borbone E. Petrocca F. Alder H.

Furthermore, when the cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions after Drosha depletion, the accumulation of the DGCR8 mRNA was observed in both fractions (Figure 1F, lanes 7 and 11). The overexpression of transdominant negative mutant (TN Drosha) also induced the DGCR8 mRNA accumulation in the nucleus, as well as in the cytoplasm (Figure S4). The siRNA against DGCR8 (siDGCR8) reduced DGCR8 mRNA in the cytoplasm (Figure 1F, lane 12), as expected since siRNAs silence their target mRNAs mainly in the cytoplasm (Zeng and Cullen, 2002Zeng Y. Cullen B.R. RNA interference in human cells is restricted to the cytoplasm.RNA. 2002; 8: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The same siRNA increased DGCR8 mRNA in the nucleus (Figure 1F, lane 8), indicating that DGCR8 protein may be involved in the nuclear destruction of its own mRNA. Because Microprocessor acts in the nucleus, these results indicate that Microprocessor may directly target the DGCR8 mRNA. Pedersen et al. reported that vertebrate DGCR8 mRNAs contain two conserved hairpins in the 5′ UTR (hairpin A) and in the coding sequence near the start codon (hairpin B) (Figure 2A) (Pedersen et al., 2006Pedersen J.S. Bejerano G. Siepel A. Rosenbloom K. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kent J. Miller W. Haussler D. Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). These structures were detected by an algorithm called EvoFold, which searches for evolutionarily conserved secondary structures (Pedersen et al., 2006Pedersen J.S. Bejerano G. Siepel A. Rosenbloom K. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kent J. Miller W. Haussler D. Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Because these hairpins have similar features to those of pri-miRNAs (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the hairpins can be cleaved by Drosha through in vitro processing assay (Lee et al., 2003Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Radmark O. Kim S. et al.The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3710) Google Scholar). The transcript used for this assay contains the 5′ UTR (+69–+350 nt) and the first 217 nt of the coding region (+351–+567 nt) (Figure 2A). When this RNA was incubated with cell extract or immunoprecipitated protein complex, two fragments were generated, demonstrating that the hairpins can be cleaved by Drosha (Figure 2B). The lengths of these products (∼60 nt and ∼76 nt) were similar to those of typical pre-miRNAs. In order to validate that these fragments were produced by Drosha not by contaminating nucleases, we performed a processing assay using a Drosha mutant, E110aQ (Figure 2C). The E110aQ contains a point mutation (E to Q) at the catalytic site of RIIIDa (Han et al., 2004Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Kim Y.K. Jin H. Kim V.N. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex in primary microRNA processing.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Because this mutant can cleave only the 5′ strand of a hairpin, it released larger cleavage fragments as expected (Figure 2C). Pri-miR-16-1 was used as a control. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the hairpin structures in the DGCR8 mRNA are cleaved by Microprocessor. It is noted that the DGCR8 hairpins are cleaved less efficiently than pri-miR-16-1, which is expected if the DGCR8 hairpins have evolved to modulate, rather than to abrogate, DGCR8 expression. Consistent with this idea, pri-miRNAs such as pri-miR-16-1, pri-let-7a-1, and pri-miR-21 were induced more strongly (4- to 10-fold) than DGCR8 mRNA (3- to 4-fold) in Drosha-depleted cells (Figures 1A and 1F). To clarify the identity of the fragments, we determined the cleavage sites by a directional cloning method (Elbashir et al., 2001Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. RNA interference is mediated by 21- and 22-nucleotide RNAs.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). The RNAs were gel purified, ligated with adapters, and reverse transcribed. The cDNAs were then amplified by PCR, cloned, and sequenced. We found that the longer cleavage fragment (indicated with a red triangle) was created from the cleavage at the site A1 of hairpin A, whereas the smaller fragments (marked with a blue triangle) were derived from two different cleavage sites—at the site A2 of hairpin A and the site B1 of hairpin B (Figure 2D). The mapping of the cleavage sites indicated that the fragments have short 3′ overhangs (Figure 2D), which were expected for the products of RNase III-mediated cleavage. The cleavage sites were 6–14 nt away from the ssRNA-dsRNA junction, depending on the conditions that were used for secondary structure prediction. This is consistent with the previous results on Drosha cleavage site selection (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The DGCR8 mRNA is highly conserved among vertebrates, including mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish (Pedersen et al., 2006Pedersen J.S. Bejerano G. Siepel A. Rosenbloom K. Lindblad-Toh K. Lander E.S. Kent J. Miller W. Haussler D. Identification and classification of conserved RNA secondary structures in the human genome.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e33Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A), so we asked whether the regulatory mechanism of DGCR8 is evolutionary conserved. For this, siRNA targeting mouse Drosha was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells (Figure 3A and Figure S5A) and mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells (Figure S6). As in humans, mouse DGCR8 mRNA and protein accumulated when Drosha was knocked down, indicating evolutionary conservation of the regulation. We also found, using EvoFold, that the 5′ UTR of Drosophila DGCR8/Pasha mRNA contains a hairpin structure, although the sequences themselves are not conserved with vertebrates (Figure S5C). When we knocked-down Drosophila Drosha in S2 cells, Pasha mRNA accumulated (Figure 3B and Figure S5B). This suggests that a similar regulatory mechanism may be present in invertebrates and thus that this regulation may have played a fundamental role throughout animal evolution. To confirm that the Drosha-mediated cleavage event of the DGCR8 mRNA occurs in vivo, we carried out a northern blot assay to detect the cleavage products in the cell. When we used probes that are complementary to hairpin A, we could detect an ∼60 nt fragment (Figure 4A). The level of this RNA was reduced by knockdown of Drosha or DGCR8 (Figure 4A, lanes 3 and 4), which is expected for the product of Microprocessor. An ∼60 nt RNA was also produced from the plasmid that ectopically expresses the RNA containing both hairpins (Figure 4B, lane 2). This indicated that the ∼60 nt band corresponds to the cleavage product generated from hairpin A. When we used probes that are complementary to the stem sequence of hairpin B, we could not detect any band by northern blotting (Figures S6A and S7). This suggested that Drosha may prefer the cleavage site A2 of hairpin A to the other sites for cleavage in vivo (Figure 2D). It is also plausible that the other fragments (the ∼76 nt fragment from the site A1 and the ∼60 nt fragment from the site B1) may be degraded rapidly in the cell, defying detection by northern blotting. Notably, we could not detect any small RNA of ∼22 nt, even when small RNA was enriched (Figure 4 and Figure S6A). Moreover, we observed that when we carried out subcellular fractionation, the ∼60 nt fragment was confined in the nuclear fraction (Figure 4C). This may be because the nuclear export of this ∼60 nt fragment is very inefficient or because the fragment gets degraded rapidly in the cytoplasm. Thus, these results suggest that the DGCR8 hairpin may not produce mature miRNA and that the hairpin may function as an RNA instability element rather than as a precursor for miRNA biogenesis. To ask whether the hairpins are required for Drosha-dependent regulation, we generated luciferase reporter constructs, one containing the DGCR8 hairpins and the other with the hairpins deleted (Figure S8). The reporter construct possessing the hairpin region is induced by Drosha or DGCR8 knockdown, whereas the reporter lacking the hairpins is not responsive to the knockdown. This indicates that the hairpins are necessary for Microprocessor-dependent gene regulation. When we depleted DGCR8 by RNAi, we also noticed that there may be an additional layer of regulation between Drosha and DGCR8. Namely, the protein level of the endogenous Drosha was downregulated after DGCR8 knockdown (Figure 1B). This reduction at the Drosha protein level was not accompanied by that of the Drosha mRNA level (Figure 1F and Figure S2B). To further examine the effect of DGCR8 on Drosha, we ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged DGCR8 and Drosha proteins in HEK293T cells. Drosha protein accumulated significantly when coexpressed with DGCR8 protein (Figure 5A). In addition, the endogenous Drosha protein increased when DGCR8 was overexpressed (Figure 5B). To confirm and extend this initial finding, we examined DGCR8 deletion mutants that cannot bind to Drosha. We formerly showed that the mutants DGCR8[1-483] and DGCR8[1-614] do not interact with Drosha, whereas the mutants DGCR8[276-773] and DGCR8[m1&2] can bind to Drosha (Yeom et al., 2006Yeom K.H. Lee Y. Han J. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. Characterization of DGCR8/Pasha, the essential cofactor for Drosha in primary miRNA processing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4622-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). When coexpressed with Drosha, the DGCR8 mutants that cannot bind to Drosha failed to upregulate Drosha (Figure 5C, lanes 4 and 5). It is noted that we made a related observation with different DGCR8 mutants (Yeom et al., 2006Yeom K.H. Lee Y. Han J. Suh M.R. Kim V.N. Characterization of DGCR8/Pasha, the essential cofactor for Drosha in primary miRNA processing.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4622-4629Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that DGCR8 may stabilize Drosha through direct protein-protein interaction. To further test this hypothesis, we examined Dgcr8 knockout (KO) mouse ES cells (Wang et al., 2007Wang Y. Medvid R. Melton C. Jaenisch R. Blelloch R. DGCR8 is essential for microRNA biogenesis and silencing of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). We compared the protein expression levels in wild-type homozygote (flox/flox), heterozygote (Δ/flox), and KO homozygote (Δ/Δ) lines by western blot assay. In Dgcr8 null ES cells, the Drosha protein levels were significantly lower than that in wild-type cells, whereas they remained unchanged in Dicer KO ES cells (Figure 6A). The Drosha mRNA levels were comparable between wild-type and Dgcr8 null ES cells (Figure 6B). We also examined mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) from Dgcr8 KO mouse (Figure S9). Like in ES cells, the Drosha protein was expressed at a lower level (∼40%) in the Dgcr8 Δ/Δ MEF compared to the wild-type cells (Figure S9A), even though the mRNA level of Drosha in Δ/Δ MEF remained similar to that in wild-type or Δ/flox MEF (Figure S9B). This result indicates that in the absence of DGCR8, Drosha is downregulated and that DGCR8 may be required to maintain the normal level of Drosha protein. Interestingly, we noticed that neither DGCR8 nor Drosha protein levels appeared to be significantly diminished in heterozygote ES or MEF (Figure 6C, lane 2, and Figure S9C, lane 2), although it is expected that only 50% of DGCR8 is expressed in these cells compared to the wild-type cells. To test whether there is compensatory expression from the remaining Dgcr8 allele in the heterozygous background, we performed qRT-PCR for exon 3 of DGCR8, which only measures expression from the wild-type allele (Figure 6D). The DGCR8 mRNA level in heterozygous cells is also ∼90% compared to that of the wild-type (Figure 6D). Consistent with the DGCR8 level, the miR-130a level in heterozygous cells is also similar to that of wild-type cells (Figure S9D). This suggests that the reduction of DGCR8 in heterozygous cells resulted in the decrease of Microprocessor activity, which in turn enhanced the expression of DGCR8 protein through the feedback circuit.

ESCRT-III is composed of four protein subunits that are monomeric in the cytosol and oligomerize into a protein lattice only upon membrane binding. Recent studies have shown that the ESCRT-III protein Snf7 can form a filament by undergoing homo-oligomerization. To examine the role of membrane binding and of interactions with other ESCRT components in initiating Snf7 oligomerization, we used fluorescence spectroscopy to directly detect and characterize the assembly of the Snf7 oligomer on liposomes using purified ESCRT components. The observed fluorescence changes reveal an obligatory sequence of membrane-protein and protein-protein interactions that generate the active conformation of Snf7. Also, we demonstrate that ESCRT-III assembly drives membrane deformation. Furthermore, using an in vitro disassembly assay, we directly demonstrate that Vps24 and Vps2 function as adaptors in the ATP-dependent membrane disassembly of the ESCRT-III complex by recruiting the AAA ATPase Vps4."

Here, we show that mice lacking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38δ display improved glucose tolerance due to enhanced insulin secretion from pancreatic β cells. Deletion of p38δ results in pronounced activation of protein kinase D (PKD), the latter of which we have identified as a pivotal regulator of stimulated insulin exocytosis. p38δ catalyzes an inhibitory phosphorylation of PKD1, thereby attenuating stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, p38δ null mice are protected against high-fat-feeding-induced insulin resistance and oxidative stress-mediated β cell failure. Inhibition of PKD1 reverses enhanced insulin secretion from p38δ-deficient islets and glucose tolerance in p38δ null mice as well as their susceptibility to oxidative stress. In conclusion, the p38δ-PKD pathway integrates regulation of the insulin secretory capacity and survival of pancreatic β cells, pointing to a pivotal role for this pathway in the development of overt diabetes mellitus."

HDAC4 overexpression in a mouse model of retinal degeneration prolonged photoreceptor survival.

Furthermore, people overestimated the degree to which a racist comment would provoke social rejection of the racist.

https://openalex.org/W2078115022,"CRISPR arrays and associated cas genes are widespread in bacteria and archaea and confer acquired resistance to viruses. To examine viral immunity in the context of naturally evolving microbial populations we analyzed genomic data from two thermophilic Synechococcus isolates (Syn OS-A and Syn OS-B′) as well as a prokaryotic metagenome and viral metagenome derived from microbial mats in hotsprings at Yellowstone National Park. Two distinct CRISPR types, distinguished by the repeat sequence, are found in both the Syn OS-A and Syn OS-B′ genomes. The genome of Syn OS-A contains a third CRISPR type with a distinct repeat sequence, which is not found in Syn OS-B′, but appears to be shared with other microorganisms that inhabit the mat. The CRISPR repeats identified in the microbial metagenome are highly conserved, while the spacer sequences (hereafter referred to as “viritopes” to emphasize their critical role in viral immunity) were mostly unique and had no high identity matches when searched against GenBank. Searching the viritopes against the viral metagenome, however, yielded several matches with high similarity some of which were within a gene identified as a likely viral lysozyme/lysin protein. Analysis of viral metagenome sequences corresponding to this lysozyme/lysin protein revealed several mutations all of which translate into silent or conservative mutations which are unlikely to affect protein function, but may help the virus evade the host CRISPR resistance mechanism. These results demonstrate the varied challenges presented by a natural virus population, and support the notion that the CRISPR/viritope system must be able to adapt quickly to provide host immunity. The ability of metagenomics to track population-level variation in viritope sequences allows for a culture-independent method for evaluating the fast co-evolution of host and viral genomes and its consequence on the structuring of complex microbial communities."

Like other condensins, the bacterial MukBEF condensin complex consists of an SMC family protein dimer containing two ATPase head domains, MukB, and two interacting subunits, MukE and MukF. We report complete structural views of the intersubunit interactions of this condensin along with ensuing studies that reveal a role for the ATPase activity of MukB. MukE and MukF together form an elongated dimeric frame, and MukF's C-terminal winged-helix domains (C-WHDs) bind MukB heads to constitute closed ring-like structures. Surprisingly, one of the two bound C-WHDs is forced to detach upon ATP-mediated engagement of MukB heads. This detachment reaction depends on the linker segment preceding the C-WHD, and mutations on the linker restrict cell growth.

A condensin holocomplex is composed of a homo- or hetero-dimer of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins and at least two non-SMC subunits. This is also true of other SMC-based complexes including cohesins. SMC proteins fold into three distinctive parts: an ATPase head domain at one end, an intervening ∼50 nm-long coiled-coil arm and a hinge domain at the other end. Hinge domains of two monomers interact with each other to form a unique V-shaped dimeric structure. The two head domains are able to bind ATP, but are catalytically inactive until they engage each other to form two composite active sites. The engaged head domains subsequently separate apart upon hydrolysis of the bound ATP molecules (Hirano, 2006Hirano T. At the heart of the chromosome: SMC proteins in action.Nat. Rev. Mol.

Hiraga S. Identification of two new genes, mukE and mukF, involved in chromosome partitioning in Escherichia coli.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that MukE and MukF play an essential role in chromosome condensation. So far, structural information on the interactions between the condensin subunits has been lacking. Although non-SMC subunits are as essential as the SMC subunit for chromosome condensation/segregation, the functional relationship between them remains mysterious. Moreover, the role of ATP in the functional mechanism of the condensin holocomplexes is virtually unknown. Here, we present three different crystal structures that provide complete pictures of the intersubunit interactions between MukB, MukE and MukF. Ensuing structure-based studies convincingly suggest that the functional mechanism of the MukBEF holocomplex involves ATP-dependent transient disruption of the MukB-MukF interaction, which creates an opening in its ring structures. The complex between full-length MukE and MukF was obtained by coexpression of the two proteins in E. coli. The structure of this complex, designated as MukEF, was determined by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIR-AS) and subsequently refined to 2.9 Å resolution (Table S1). In the crystal, two MukE molecules interacted with one molecule of MukF. Through the dimerization of MukF, two copies of this heterotrimer associated with each other to form a large (MukF–(MukE)2)2 hexameric complex (Figure 1A). Electron density for the C-terminal part of MukF (residues 328-440) was missing, although it was not cleaved off during crystallization. This invisible portion, corresponding to the last 113 amino acids of MukF, was shown to be responsible for binding the MukB head domain (Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. The MukF subunit of Escherichia coli condensin: architecture and functional relationship to kleisins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). It is composed of a linker segment (residues 328-354) and the following C-terminal winged-helix domain (C-WHD). Most likely, this domain was invisible, because it lacked crystal packing interactions and was mobile as a rigid body within the crystal due to the flexibility of the preceding linker segment. MukF comprises four sequentially folded domains: an N-terminal WHD domain (residues 1-120), a four-helix bundle (residues 121-291 composing α6, α7, α8 and α9), a middle region (residues 292-354 composing α10, β4, β5 and a flexible linker) and a WHD (residues 355-440) at the C-terminus (Figure 1B). Up to the 281st residue, the MukE-bound MukF structure reported here is essentially the same as the previously reported structure of a stable MukF fragment comprising residues 1-287 (Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. The MukF subunit of Escherichia coli condensin: architecture and functional relationship to kleisins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our structure, residues 282-290 form the last part of the fourth α-helix of the helix bundle. The following middle region of MukF interacts with the MukE dimer extensively and tightly. Notably, the β strand-like segment (β4 and β5) is embedded in the MukE dimer, as if it is a part of the MukE structure (Figure 1A,C). Previously, a protein dissection experiment showed that MukF alone was readily cleaved at residues 287, 301 and 330 by proteolysis (Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. The MukF subunit of Escherichia coli condensin: architecture and functional relationship to kleisins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), indicating that the segment comprising residues 287-330 is intrinsically disordered. Our structure now shows that the binding of MukE results in the disorder-to-order change of this ∼40 residue-long segment of MukF, and that the following C-WHD dangles from the distal end of the complex. MukE is composed of two WHDs (Figure 1C) that are different in size as well as in structural details. The N-terminal WHDs of two MukE molecules interact with each other to form a homodimeric structure in which the C-terminal WHDs are largely separated apart (Figure 1C). The homodimer interface involves α1, α2, the tip region of α4, and a part of the β2-β3 loop of each subunit that together form a flat hydrophobic contact surface. The two subunits of MukE interact with MukF disproportionately. The interface of one subunit, MukEa, is extensive and involves various parts of the molecule that interact primarily with the middle region of MukF (α10 and the first half of the MukE-embedded segment) (Figure 1C). Additionally, α6 and the following loop of MukEa insert into and interact with a groove between the four-helix bundle and the N-terminal WHD of MukF (Figure 1C, bottom right). This intermolecular interaction ties up the middle region and the four-helix bundle of MukF rigidly (Figure 1A), which is otherwise flexibly connected to each other (Figure 1B). In contrast, the interface of the other subunit, MukEb, is limited to β3 that interacts with β5 of MukF, the second half of the MukE-embedded segment (Figure 1C, top, middle). With the two copies of the MukE dimer, the MukE-embedded segments extend out from the core of MukF in the opposite directions, resulting in the characteristically elongated molecular assembly (Figure 1A). With the visible part alone, the longest dimension of MukEF reaches 170 Å. In order to obtain structural information about the interactions between MukB and MukEF, various protein complexes were designed based on the MukEF structure and subjected to crystallization trial. The screening effort included proteins derived from Haemophilus ducreyi MukB, MukE and MukF (designated as hMukB, hMukE and hMukF), which display high sequence identity (> 60%) with their E. coli counterparts. One finally crystallized complex was composed of full-length hMukE, a hMukF fragment (residue 292-443) spanning the middle region and the C-WHD, designated as hMukF(M+C), and the head domain of a hMukB mutant containing an E1435Q substitution (Figure 2A). This mutant hMukB head, designated as hMukBhdEQ, was generated by replacing the coiled-coils plus the hinge domain with a short linker sequence (Figure 2A). It corresponds to one of the two head domains in full-length dimeric hMukB. The E1435Q mutation at the active site was introduced based on several studies showing that a corresponding mutation in ABC-type ATPases effectively stabilizes the ATP-sandwiched head domain dimer of these proteins (Hirano and Hirano, 2004Hirano M. Hirano T. Positive and negative regulation of SMC-DNA interactions by ATP and accessory proteins.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Moody et al., 2002Moody J.E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21111-21114Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Two different crystal forms of the complex (Form I and Form II) were obtained in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS. The solution for growing the Form I crystal additionally contained 18 nucleotide double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at 0.5 mM. While the Form II crystals grew to a huge size in two days and diffracted x-ray poorly, the Form I crystals took more than a month to grow into a tiny size, but diffracted x-ray better (3.1 Å resolution) and were amenable for structure determination (Table S1). In the Form I crystal, the symmetric dimer of hMukBhdEQ complexed with hMukF C-WHD and ATPγS was clearly visible, but the middle region of hMukF and hMukE bound to it exhibited only blobs of electron densities due to poor crystal packing interactions. In addition, the linker segment between the middle region and the C-WHD of MukF was totally unobservable, as it was in the MukEF crystal, confirming that the linker segment of MukF is highly flexible. Two ATPγS molecules are bound to the composite active sites between two molecules of hMukBhdEQ, which are related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry (Figure 2B). The N- and C-terminal domains of hMukB separated by the coiled-coil region on the primary structure contact with each other tightly. The two coiled-coil roots are located at the side opposite to the interface for binding hMukF C-WHD (Figure 2B). A structural superposition reveals that the structure of hMukB head is similar to those of Pyrococcus furiosus SMC head and yeast Smc1 head (Figure S1A), despite less than 9% sequence identity with the two proteins. Furthermore, the four sequence motifs, Walker A, Walker B, signature and D-loop motifs, involved in the formation of the composite active sites, are all highly conserved in MukB like other SMC-related proteins (Figure S1B,C), supporting an idea that the ATP-dependent head domain engagement/disengagement is a common mechanistic theme underlying the function of these proteins. The binding interface between hMukBhdEQ and hMukF C-WHD is a buried surface area of 1259 Å2, which primarily involves a pair of β-strands (β15 and β16) in hMukBhdEQ and β1, α3 and loop α3-β1 in hMukF C-WHD (Figure 2C). While the overall intermolecular interaction between the two domains appears similar to that between Smc1 head and Scc1 C-WHD in yeast cohesin (Haering et al., 2004Haering C.H. Schoffnegger D. Nishino T. Helmhart W. Nasmyth K. Lowe J. Structure and stability of cohesin's Smc1-kleisin interaction.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), detailed interactions are quite different at least in two aspects. First, the residues on α3 of hMukF C-WHD involved in the intermolecular interaction bear no sequence similarity with the corresponding residues of Scc1 (not shown). Second, loop α3-β1 of hMukF C-WHD is markedly long compared with the corresponding region of Scc1 (Figure 2C), and the former interacts with hMukB head fairly extensively while the latter is involved in fewer interactions with Smc1 head (not shown). MukB is known to bind dsDNA (Niki et al., 1992Niki H. Imamura R. Kitaoka M. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Hiraga S. E.coli MukB protein involved in chromosome partition forms a homodimer with a rod-and-hinge structure having DNA binding and ATP/GTP binding activities.Embo J. 1992; 11: 5101-5109Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, Petrushenko et al., 2006aPetrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rai R. Rybenkov V.V. DNA reshaping by MukB. Right-handed knotting, left-handed supercoiling.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but its DNA-binding site is unknown. The structure of ATPγS-bound hMukBhdEQ prompted us to identify the DNA-binding site on hMukB head. In the dimerized hMukB heads, the top surface containing the coiled-coil roots is decorated with many positively charged residues (Figure 2D), indicating that this surface may be responsible for binding dsDNA. We carried out charge-inversion mutagenesis on this and nearby surfaces and subsequently DNA-binding capacity of the resulting mutants was analyzed by DNA electromobility shift assay. A total of six different hMukBhdEQ mutants were generated, and five of them, containing mutations on the top surface, exhibited severe or notable defects in DNA-binding affinity (Figure 2D). In comparison, the remaining variant, containing an R127E mutation at the side surface of hMukBhdEQ, showed a mild defect. These results identify the top surface as the major DNA-binding site on hMukB head. In the Form I crystal, however, electron density for the added DNA was not observed. The lack of electron density may be due to sliding of the DNA on the top surface, which is flat and probably lacks specificity in dsDNA binding. The Form II crystal of the quadruple hMukE–hMukF(M+C)–hMukBhdEQ–ATPγS complex diffracted x-ray only up to 4.0 Å resolution, and its structure was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined carefully to a full extent. In the structure, two features were unexpected and extremely intriguing. First, the quadruple complex is asymmetric in that only one hMukE–hMukF(M+C) is bound to the ATPγS-sandwiched dimer of hMukBhdEQ. Second, the flexible linker segment (residues 329-355) of the bound hMukF(M+C), invisible in the Form I crystal, is visible and surprisingly interacts with one of the two dimerized hMukBhdEQ molecules which is unoccupied by MukF C-WHD (Figure 3A). The surface of hMukBhdEQ interacting with the linker segment overlaps with its interface for binding MukF C-WHD in the Form I crystal (Figure 3B). The asymmetric unit of the Form II crystal contains two independent copies of the quadruple complex. In these two copies, the commonly visible parts of the linker occupy the same site on the hMukBhdEQ surface (Figure S2), suggesting that the linker-hMukBhd interaction is specific. To verify that the unexpected detachment of hMukF C-WHD from the dimerized hMukB heads takes place in solution, we reacted hMukE–hMukF(M+C)–hMukBhdEQ with ATP to induce dimerization between two copies of this monomeric complex through the head domain engagement. If no detachment of hMukE–hMukF(M+C) takes place, the ATP-bound symmetric dimer of this complex should be the sole product. On the contrary, the complex (Figure 3C; band a) was converted into two species: a high- and a low-molecular weight species (Figure 3C; bands b and c). Subsequent analyses identified the two bands as the asymmetric hMukE–hMukF(M+C)–(hMukBhdEQ–ATP)2 dimer and detached hMukE–hMukF(M+C), respectively (Figure 3C). The same conversion reaction was also observed with the catalytically active MukE–MukF(M+C)–MukBhd complex derived from the E.coli proteins and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPNP (Figure 3D, left pannel). As a control, we employed an engagement-defective MukB head mutant containing an S1366R substitution (designated as MukBhdSR). With this mutant-containing MukE–MukF(M+C)–MukBhdSR complex, no conversion reaction was observed in the reaction with ATP, while MukE-MukF(M+C)-MukBhdEQ underwent the conversion reaction (Figure 3D, middle pannel). Without added nucleotide, neither asymmetric dimer formation nor MukE–MukF(M+C) dissociation was observed with any of the three triple complexes (Figure 3D, right panel). Together, these data demonstrate that the detachment of MukF C-WHD is a consequence of the ATP-mediated head domain engagement. Being unaware of the detachment of hMukF C-WHD upon addition of ATPγS, we had obtained the Form I and Form II crystals without removing free hMukE–hMukF(M+C). A comparison of the structures in the two crystal forms plausibly explains how engagement of MukB heads induces the detachment of MukE–MukF(M+C) in solution and how this detachment can be reconciled with the formation of the symmetric dimer in the Form I crystal. The first helix (α1) of hMukF C-WHD in the asymmetric dimer is longer by a 2/3 turn compared with that in the symmetric dimer (Figure 3B). In the symmetric dimer, α1 in one C-WHD is in close contact with the other C-WHD (Figure 2B), indicating that helix unwinding takes place to avoid steric crash when two hMukF C-WHDs are forced to juxtapose to each other by the engagement of hMukB heads. In the Form I crystal, α1 of hMukF C-WHD is likely to be unstably maintained, because its temperature factors (average= 94 Å2) are considerably higher than those (average= 53 Å2) of the other α-helices in the same domain. These observations suggest that the ATP-induced dimerization of hMukE–hMukF(M+C)–hMukBhdEQ in solution results in sterically unfavorable contact between the two bound C-WHDs of hMukF, which destabilizes the head-WHD interaction and consequently allows the flexible linker of one C-WHD to competitively displace the other C-WHD. In the Form I crystal, MukF C-WHD is involved in rather extensive crystal packing interactions (Figure S3), unlike that in the Form II crystal. Conceivably, these interactions in the Form I crystal could have compensated for the destabilized head-WHD interaction, and allowed free hMukE–hMukF(M+C) remained in the crystallization solution to competitively displace the flexible linker bound to hMukBhdEQ to form the symmetric complex during the crystallization process. In solution, the binding affinity between the asymmetric dimer and hMukE−hMukF(M+C) seems quite low, because incubation of these two complexes even at 1:30 molar ratio (4 and 120 μM) did not result in the formation of the symmetric dimer (data not shown). To test the notion that the flexible linker of MukF plays an important role in the detachment reaction, we constructed a MukF fragment containing its C-terminal WHD only (residues 358-440). This fragment, designated as MukF(C), lacks the residues forming the additional 2/3 turn in α1 in the asymmetric dimer (Figure 3B). We prepared catalytically active MukF(C)–MukBhd complex and reacted with AMPPNP. Because MukF(C)–MukBhd alone or in complex with AMPPNP did not migrate on a native gel, the mixture was analyzed by gel filtration. The chromatogram of the mixture clearly showed dimerization of MukB heads without releasing MukF(C) (Figure 4A), indicating that the flexible linker is indeed required for the detachment of MukF C-WHD. Next, to test whether the flexible linker could compete with MukF C-WHD for binding MukB head, we prepared an 18-mer synthetic peptide covering the visible linker residues in the Form II crystal (Figure 4C). This peptide, at 200-fold molar excess over the monomeric MukE–MukF(M+C)–MukBhd complex, released MukE–MukF(M+C) from this complex, while an unrelated 16-mer peptide at 500-fold molar excess did not (Figure 4B). These observations suggest that MukF C-WHD is forced to detach from engaged MukB heads in the ATPase cycle of MukB (Figure S4) and the two transient intermediates related by this detachment step are represented by the structures of the symmetric and asymmetric dimers. We then sought to find novel mutations on the flexible linker of MukF that interfere with the detachment step and result in the stabilization of the symmetric dimer form. Based on the structure of the asymmetric dimer and on a multiple sequence alignment, three sets of mutations on the linker were designed, designated as LM1, LM2 and LM3 (Figure 4C). They contain three or four glycine substitutions of the conserved linker residues that are likely to interact with MukB head according to the low resolution structure. We chose multiple mutations, rather than a single mutation, to reduce the binding affinity between the linker and MukB head, considering the fairly extensive linear contacts between the two (Figure 3A). LM1, LM2 and LM3 commonly contain three additional glycine substitutions on α1 (Figure 4C), which was intended to disturb its helical structure, thereby removing or lessening the putative steric crash between the two juxtaposed MukF C-WHD on engaged MukB heads. These mutations were introduced into MukF(M+C), and the resulting variants in complex with MukE and MukBhd were prepared. These complexes were reacted with AMPPNP and the reaction products were examined on a native gel. With all these mutations, a new high molecular band (labeled as “sym”) was observed, as compared with the wild-type complex (Figure 4D). The new species was identified as the symmetrically engaged dimer of the triple complex (Figure S5). The mutational effect appears minor, because the symmetric dimer was not a sole product, but observed together with the asymmetric dimer (band b) (Figure 4D). In the in vitro reaction, which was virtually an equilibrated reaction, the mutated linkers could"

In budding yeast, Cdc13 plays an essential role in telomere length homeostasis, partly through its interactions with both the telomerase complex and the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. Previous studies in yeast have shown that telomere elongation by telomerase is cell cycle dependent, but the mechanism underlying this dependence is unclear. In S. cerevisiae, a single cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (Cdc28) coordinates the serial events required for the cell division cycle, but no Cdk1 substrate has been identified among telomerase and telomere-associated factors. Here we show that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc13 is essential for efficient recruitment of the yeast telomerase complex to telomeres by favoring the interaction of Cdc13 with Est1 rather than the competing Stn1-Ten1 complex. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between coordination of telomere elongation and cell-cycle progression in vivo."

We found that the codon UGA specifies insertion of selenocysteine and cysteine in the ciliate Euplotes crassus , that the dual use of this codon can occur even within the same gene, and that the structural arrangements of Euplotes mRNA preserve location-dependent dual function of UGA when expressed in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2163500752,"Hydrophobicity is an important attribute of bacteria that contributes to adhesion and biofilm formation. Hydrophobicity of Streptococcus pyogenes is primarily due to lipoteichoic acid (LTA) on the streptococcal surface but the mechanism(s) whereby LTA is retained on the surface is poorly understood. In this study, we sought to determine whether members of the M protein family consisting of Emm (M protein), Mrp (M-related protein), Enn (an M-like protein), and the streptococcal protective antigen (Spa) are involved in anchoring LTA in a manner that contributes to hydrophobicity of the streptococci and its ability to form biofilms.Isogenic mutants defective in expression of emm, mrp, enn, and/or spa genes of eight different serotypes and their parental strains were tested for differences in LTA bound to surface proteins, LTA released into the culture media, and membrane-bound LTA. The effect of these mutations on the ability of streptococci to form a hydrophobic surface and to generate biofilms was also investigated. A recombinant strain overexpressing Emm1 was also engineered and similarly tested. The serotypes tested ranged from those that express only a single M protein gene to those that express two or three members of the M protein family. Overexpression of Emm1 led to enhanced hydrophobicity and biofilm formation. Inactivation of emm in those serotypes expressing only a single emm gene reduced biofilm formation, and protein-bound LTA on the surface, but did not alter the levels of membrane-bound LTA. The results were more varied in those serotypes that express two to three members of the M protein family.Our findings suggest that the formation of complexes with members of the M protein family is a common mechanism for anchoring LTA on the surface in a manner that contributes to hydrophobicity and to biofilm formation in S. pyogenes, but these activities in some serotypes are dependent on a trypsin-sensitive protein(s) that remains to be identified. The need for interactions between LTA and M proteins may impose functional constraints that limit variations in the sequence of the M proteins, major virulence factors of S. pyogenes."

Pax6 is a paired domain and homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for development of central nervous, olfactory and visual systems, as well as endocrine pancreas. Haploinsufficiency of Pax6 results in perturbed lens development and homeostasis. Loss-of-function of Pax6 is incompatible with lens lineage formation and results in abnormal telencephalic development. Using DNA microarrays, we have identified 559 genes expressed differentially between 1-day old mouse Pax6 heterozygous and wild type lenses. Of these, 178 (31.8%) were similarly increased and decreased in Pax6 homozygous embryonic telencephalon [Holm PC, Mader MT, Haubst N, Wizenmann A, Sigvardsson M, Götz M (2007) Loss- and gain-of-function analyses reveals targets of Pax6 in the developing mouse telencephalon.

Differential expression of nine genes implicated in lens development and homeostasis: Cspg2, Igfbp5, Mab21l2, Nrf2f, Olfm3, Spag5, Spock1, Spon1 and Tgfb2, was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR, with five of these genes: Cspg2, Mab21l2, Olfm3, Spag5 and Tgfb2, identified as candidate direct Pax6 target genes by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP). In Mab21l2 and Tgfb2 promoter regions, twelve putative individual Pax6-binding sites were tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with recombinant Pax6 proteins. This led to the identification of two and three sites in the respective Mab21l2 and Tgfb2 promoter regions identified by qChIPs. Collectively, the present studies represent an integrative genome-wide approach to identify downstream networks controlled by Pax6 that control mouse lens and forebrain development."

Although NIF-1 does not directly interact with nuclear hormone receptors, it enhances activation by nuclear hormone receptors presumably through its interaction with NRC. To further understand the cellular and biological function of NIF-1, we identified NIF-1-associated proteins by in-solution proteolysis followed by mass spectrometry. The identified components revealed factors involved in histone methylation and cell cycle control and include Ash2L, RbBP5, WDR5, HCF-1, DBC-1, and EMSY. Although the NIF-1 complex contains Ash2L, RbBP5, and WDR5, suggesting that the complex might methylate histone H3-Lys-4, we found that the complex contains a H3 methyltransferase activity that modifies a residue other than H3-Lys-4. The identified components form at least two distinctly sized NIF-1 complexes. DBC-1 and EMSY were identified as integral components of an NIF-1 complex of approximately 1.5 MDa and were found to play an important role in the regulation of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. Stimulation of the Sox9 and HoxA1 genes by retinoic acid receptor-alpha was found to require both DBC-1 and EMSY in addition to NIF-1 for maximal transcriptional activation.

Science diplomacy is the use of scientific collaborations among nations to address the common problems facing 21st century humanity and to build constructive international partnerships. There are many ways that scientists can contribute to this process. Bill Gates, arguably the world's most famous technocrat, gave a remarkable speech during the 2008 Davos World Economic Forum, calling for a new form of capitalism to go beyond traditional philanthropy and government aid. Citing examples ranging from the development of software for people who cannot read to developing vaccines at a price that Africans can afford to pay, Gates said such projects “…provide a hint of what we can accomplish if people who are experts on needs in the developing world meet with scientists who understand what the breakthroughs are, whether it's in software or drugs” (http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/01-24WEFDavos.mspx). He suggested that we need to develop a new business model that would allow a combination of the motivation to help humanity and the profit motive to drive development. He called it “creative capitalism,” capitalism leavened by a pinch of idealism and altruistic desire to better the lot of others. Scientists and engineers have an important role to play in creating what New York Times columnist Tom Friedman calls a “flat world,” a world of economic opportunity made equal through electronic communication technologies (http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/bookshelf/the-world-is-flat). This transformation has not yet penetrated into the poorest parts of the world and needs much more scientific and technical investment. But today, most scientists look to foreign institutions for top-notch graduate students and post-docs to populate their laboratories. The notion of becoming a science diplomat, of taking time out from a busy and competitive career to teach, develop research collaborations, or start a business in the least advanced countries is just not on the radar screen for most scientists and engineers. Yet there are such opportunities, both in the US Department of State and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), as well as in non-governmental organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences, for scientists and engineers to use their scientific and technical skills in the service of international diplomacy. I took one such opportunity last year when, as a geneticist and molecular biologist at the Pennsylvania State University, I was invited to serve as the Science and Technology Adviser to the US Secretary of State. My position is not a political one: I have served current Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice and I will serve Secretary-designate Hillary Clinton upon her assumption of office this month. I accepted the position because my involvement in scientific interactions between US scientists and scientists in the former Soviet Union through the 1990s convinced me of the profound stabilizing influence that scientific interactions can exert between countries with deeply discordant ideologies and political systems. Not long after I joined the State Department, I received an invitation from USAID Administrator Henrietta Fore to be her Science and Technology Adviser, as well. The mission she gave me was to assist her in restoring the scientific and technical strength of the agency to enable the better use of science and technology for international development. My primary task at both the US Department of State, the home base of our international diplomatic corps, and USAID is to increase scientific input into the many activities of the Department and the Agency. The Office of the Science Adviser to the Secretary of State was established in 2000 in response to a National Research Council study, titled “The Pervasive Role of Science, Technology, and Health in Foreign Policy” (http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309067855), that highlighted the attrition of scientists from State Department ranks at a time when the importance of science and technology was expanding in every aspect of foreign policy. Under the leadership of the first Science Adviser to the Secretary of State, Dr. Norman Neureiter, the number of active scientists in the department began to grow again as he promoted the expansion of the AAAS Science Diplomacy Fellows program (http://fellowships.aaas.org/02_Areas/02_index.shtml) within the State Department. Today we have roughly 30 new AAAS Fellows joining us every year for 1–2 years of service. Many stay on to make careers in the State Department, becoming science diplomats serving either in Washington DC or as Foreign Service Officers. My predecessor as Science Adviser, Dr. George Atkinson, created the Jefferson Science Fellowship program (http://www7.nationalacademies.org/jefferson/), which provides an opportunity for tenured academic scientists and engineers farther along in their careers than the typical AAAS fellow to work in the State Department. Jefferson Science Fellows come to the State Department for a year, funded by their own university as they would be on a sabbatical leave. The State Department covers their local living and travel expenses. Fellows then consult for the State Department for an additional 5 years after returning to their home institutions. Jefferson Science Fellows are often individuals who already have a keen awareness of the importance of international collaborations and use their association with the State Department to broaden their influence and involvement in foreign relations and development efforts. For example, Dr. Osama Awadelkarim, a Sudanese-born Professor of Materials Science at the Pennsylvania State University, served as a Jefferson Science Fellow in 2006. His passionate devotion to enhancing scientific and engineering expertise in Africa took him to several African countries to teach and to establish collaborations, as well as to talk with government officials and champion the importance of international scientific interactions. In a speech given at the 2006 World Food Prize symposium, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said the following: “It could be argued that our inability to continue our investment in human capital on a scale that we did in the 1960s and 1970s is a factor that has contributed at least in some measure to instability in many places today and hostility to the United States. …The United States was the key influence in developing the Indian agricultural university system, the key contributor to the African agricultural universities, and to Asian and Latin American agricultural universities as well. But such US programs are now a pale shadow of what they once were. Science has disappeared. Human capital development has disappeared. And the investments for long-term institution building have nearly disappeared.” There remains a profound gap between the citizens of affluent nations, who have access to abundant food, up-to-date technology, and excellent educational opportunities, and citizens of the poorest countries of every continent, many of whom lack adequate food, often have no electricity, and have little access to either the Internet or higher education. The technological aspect of this gap has been called the “digital divide” and much has been written about it. Some believe that the problems of the poorest countries are simply solved by cell phones and inexpensive computers that can be used even in places that lack electricity. Certainly these technologies are important and make the job possible, if not easy. But the problems are deep and stubborn. Perhaps the most poignant disparities exist between the countries of the developed world and much of Africa, where climate, disease, soil exhaustion, and a host of other problems contribute. In his book titled “The Bottom Billion,” economist Paul Collier (http://users.ox.ac.uk/∼econpco/) offers an insightful analysis of the many factors that contribute to trapping the poorest nations in continuing cycles of poverty and unrest. The global food crisis of 2008 triggered food riots in more than 30 countries and calls for a new Green Revolution. The first Green Revolution, however, was relatively straightforward, if not easy: improved crop varieties and increased fertilizer use. The next Green Revolution will be more difficult, even if we succeed in overcoming the deep and widespread mistrust of using modern molecular methods for the genetic improvement of crop plants. In a crowded world, we no longer have the luxury of focusing on the single variable of agricultural productivity. Food, water, energy, health, and economic development are all intertwined. Progress will depend on a high level of education, particularly in science and engineering. All will be impacted by climate change and politics—everywhere. Climate change is a wake-up call to the awareness that we live in a world without borders. Airplanes can make SARS and multidrug-resistant TB everyone's problem in a heartbeat. Trade barriers between nations and farm subsidies in developed nations stifle agricultural growth in developing countries. The rush toward renewable energy from biofuels accelerates deforestation in the Amazon, however indirectly, and with each acre lost, another multitude of species goes extinct. Wall Street's problems echo around the world. And all of these seemingly separate problems turn out to be interconnected. Food and energy are now viewed as fungible. Growing the food—and feed and fiber and fuel—demanded by a still expanding and increasingly affluent human population requires innovations not just in agricultural productivity but also in water and land management, food processing, and transportation. Decimating what remains of the tropic's forests will as surely exacerbate climate change as it will reduce biodiversity. It's one big thorny tangle: people, money, food, energy, health, water, land, climate, biodiversity. How do we as scientists begin to think—and act—on a global scale to address such complicated problems? It seems to me that we must first become citizens not just of our own nations, but of this world without borders. We need to see, experience, and identify with the peoples and the problems of other nations and to recognize the complexity and interconnections among the challenges facing 21st century humanity. And perhaps most importantly of all, we need to understand, at a deep gut level, that all our fates are truly intertwined. We must move quickly to develop the science that will allow us to model and understand the complex system that is our planet and its crust of human activities. We need to invent efficient, nonpolluting means of local power generation. We need to invest in the research that will allow us to improve how we manage water, grow food, battle disease, and build economies into the next generation—and the next. Science, of course, provides the common language to build bridges between cultures. Education is a stumbling block. The US has educated talented students from around the world for many years. Today virtually every developed country realizes the value to the economy of such talent—and actively seeks to recruit it. But herein lies a paradox: sending its best students to be educated in more developed countries exacerbates a poor country's problems because the education itself—whether it is a teacher's certificate, a nursing degree, or a PhD—makes it easier to find employment and a more stable life in a developed country. Such “brain drain” has robbed—and is continuing to rob—many poor countries of their educated people. These are the people who design, develop, and maintain society's infrastructure—its agriculture, its schools, its clinics, its power, and telecommunications networks. As well, they are the professors and researchers who generate and propagate the knowledge—the science and technology—that are essential in every aspect of life and that are increasingly recognized as the driving forces of successful economies. I believe that we need a deep paradigm shift in our interactions with the less developed world: from distant aid recipients to partners in building a global future. We need to bring the science, the engineering, and technology and the educational systems of developed countries to bear directly and in new ways to create a world in which all people have the educational and economic opportunities now available almost exclusively in the developed world. I believe this paradigm shift is getting underway—among governments, in foundations, in the business world, and in the academic world. It is driven in some measure by necessity and perhaps in some measure by the fact that modern communications media make the disparities among the nations of the world harshly and constantly apparent to everyone. But there is much, much more to be done and not all of it can be done by governments. In April, Secretary of State Rice, Secretary of Education Spellings, and USAID Administrator Fore convened a global conference of college and university presidents, companies, and foundations (Higher Education Summit for Global Development, April 29–30, 2008; http://www.state.gov/g/stas/events/c26110.htm). Its purpose was to explore new ways of connecting the institutions of higher education in the developed and developing worlds across the entire spectrum of what contemporary universities do, from teaching and research, to supporting technology transfer and entrepreneurship. The means of connecting educational resources and people between continents have never been richer, more varied, or easier. From MIT OpenCourseWare to digital videoconferencing and collaborative software, we can teach and work between countries and continents—and in real time. The Internet and broadband connections are critical; availability is increasing and cost is decreasing but in places remains prohibitive. This is where governments, companies, and foundations can help. Yet the challenge of connecting people and resources remains, of making global service—what I've called science diplomacy—a part of what we do as scientists and engineers, whether we work in a government agency, a university, a research institute, or a company. The traditional approach of educating students in our institutions and laboratories is increasingly unacceptable. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, arguably the African leader most supportive of science and technology in developing and modernizing his country, gave an articulate and moving talk at the recent Higher Education Summit for Global Development. Bluntly paraphrased, his most salient points are these: “We provide you with foreign aid in the form of trained and educated people. You send us expensive consultants to tell us what we already know” (President Kagame's full speech is available at http://www.gov.rw/government/president/speeches/2008/29_04_08_education_usa.html). We need our scientists and engineers, our experts of all kinds, whether in the lab or in the diplomatic corps, to help us jump the digital divide, both technically and personally. We need scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs to coach and teach until the world is truly flat, to call on Friedman's metaphor again; that is, until all peoples have the educational and economic opportunities to build and live in sustainable knowledge societies. That's 21st century science diplomacy."
https://openalex.org/W2026655455,"Segregation of nonexchange chromosomes during Drosophila melanogaster meiosis requires the proper function of NOD, a nonmotile kinesin-10. We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the NOD catalytic domain in the ADP- and AMPPNP-bound states. These structures reveal an alternate conformation of the microtubule binding region as well as a nucleotide-sensitive relay of hydrogen bonds at the active site. Additionally, a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of the nucleotide-free microtubule-NOD complex shows an atypical binding orientation. Thermodynamic studies show that NOD binds tightly to microtubules in the nucleotide-free state, yet other nucleotide states, including AMPPNP, are weakened. Our pre-steady-state kinetic analysis demonstrates that NOD interaction with microtubules occurs slowly with weak activation of ADP product release. Upon rapid substrate binding, NOD detaches from the microtubule prior to the rate-limiting step of ATP hydrolysis, which is also atypical for a kinesin. We propose a model for NOD's microtubule plus-end tracking that drives chromosome movement."
https://openalex.org/W2058519809,"Conventional split inteins have been useful for trans-splicing between recombinant proteins, and an artificial S1 split intein is useful for adding synthetic peptide onto the N terminus of recombinant proteins. Here we have engineered a novel S11 split intein for trans-splicing synthetic peptide onto the C terminus of recombinant proteins. The C-intein of the S11 split intein is extremely small (6 amino acids (aa)); thus it can easily be produced together with a synthetic C-extein to be added to the C terminus of target proteins. The S11 intein was derived from the Ssp GyrB intein after deleting the homing endonuclease domain and splitting the remaining intein sequence near the C terminus, producing a 150-aa N-intein (IN) and a 6-aa C-intein (IC). Its trans-splicing activity was demonstrated first in Escherichia coli cells and then in vitro for trans-splicing between a synthetic peptide and a recombinant protein. The in vitro trans-splicing reaction exhibited a typical rate constant of (6.9 ± 2.2) × 10–5 s–1 and reached a high efficiency of ∼80%.

Inteins are internal protein sequences and catalyze a protein-splicing reaction, which precisely excises the intein sequence and join the flanking sequences (N- and C-exteins) with a peptide bond (1Perler F.B.

The reaction mechanism of protein splicing has been well studied (2Xu M.Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and the conserved crystal structure of the protein-splicing domain of inteins consists of ∼12 β-strands that form a disk-like compact structure with the two splicing junctions located in a central cleft (4Duan X.

More than 400 inteins and intein-like sequences have been found in a wide variety of host proteins and in microorganisms including bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes (8Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Saleh L. Perler F.B. Chem. Rec. 2006; 6: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Inteins are typically 350–550 aa 3The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acids; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. in size (8Perler F.B.

Rec. 2006; 6: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with the majority containing a homing endonuclease domain. Some inteins are as large as 1650 aa in size and contain tandem repeats (10Liu X.Q. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26315-26318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Meng Q. Liu X.Q. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Inteins can lose the endonuclease domain, and the resulting functional mini-intein retains only the splicing domain ∼140 aa in size (12Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Perler F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys.

Split inteins are essentially mini-inteins broken into two pieces and able to reassociate and carry out protein trans-splicing (15Liu X.Q. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In certain cyanobacteria, a natural split intein is responsible for producing a mature DnaE protein by trans-splicing two separate polypeptides expressed from two separate genes (16Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Caspi J. Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Artificial split inteins have also been engineered by splitting the sequences of contiguous inteins to resemble naturally occurring split inteins (13Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Split inteins have many practical uses including the production of recombinant proteins from fragments and the circularization of recombinant proteins (20Evans Jr., T.C. Martin D. Kolly R. Panne D. Sun L. Ghosh I. Chen L. Benner J. Liu X.Q. Xu M.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9091-9094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, conventional split inteins are less useful for adding synthetic peptide to proteins because their split sites are relatively close to the middle of the intein sequence and correspond to the insertion site of the homing endonuclease domain. These split sites are referred to as S0 and split the intein sequence into an N-terminal piece of ∼100 aa and a C-terminal piece of ∼40 aa (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These intein pieces are prone to misfolding, and their relatively large sizes make them difficult to be produced through chemical synthesis, particularly after adding desired extein sequences. Novel split inteins having a split site proximal to the N- or C-terminal would have expanded utilities because they can be used to trans-splice a short synthetic peptide onto recombinant proteins. Recently, an S1 split intein was engineered from the Ssp DnaB intein by splitting the intein sequence at a S1 site proximal to the N-terminal, producing an N-terminal piece (N-intein) of only 11 aa in length and a C-terminal piece (C-intein) of 144 aa in length (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As the short N-intein can be synthesized chemically with an additional N-extein peptide containing desirable chemical groups, this S1 split intein has been used successfully to trans-splice a fluorophore onto the N terminus of recombinant proteins (22Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, this S1 split intein is not suitable for adding synthetic peptide to the C terminus of proteins because the 144-aa C-intein is too large for chemical synthesis. A previous attempt to produce split inteins having a small C-intein has not been successful (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we report the successful engineering of a novel S11 split intein for adding synthetic peptide to the C terminus of recombinant proteins. A total of nine natural inteins were first converted to mini-inteins and then split at the S11 split site near the C terminus of the intein sequence, producing an N-intein of ∼150 aa in length and a C-intein of only 6 aa in length. Among all the inteins tested, an S11 split intein derived from the Ssp GyrB intein was first shown to trans-splice efficiently in Escherichia coli cells. It was further shown to efficiently trans-splice a synthetic peptide with a recombinant protein in vitro. Kinetic analysis of the trans-splicing reaction demonstrated a high efficiency (∼80%) and a rate constant comparable with those of the conventional and the S1 split inteins. This novel S11 split intein significantly expands the utility of split inteins, providing the potential to add any number of desirable chemical groups onto the C terminus of target proteins. Plasmid Construction-The Ssp GyrB mini-intein was constructed by fusing the N- and C-terminal coding sequences of the Ssp GyrB intein (8Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment was PCR-amplified from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 genomic DNA using a pair of oligonucleotide primers (5′-CTC GAG GGC GGT TGT TTT TCT GGA GAT ACA TTA GTC GC-3′ and 5′-CAT ATG ACC AGA ATC TTC CGT AGT CGA AAT-3′). The C-terminal segment was obtained similarly, using the primer pair 5′-CAT ATG GAA GCA GTA TTA AAT TAC AAT CAC AG-3′ and 5′-GAC CGG TCT CGC CAG CGC TGT TAT GGA CAA ACA CTC-3′. These segments were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes (XhoI, NdeI, and AgeI) and were placed in the pMST plasmid (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) between the XhoI and AgeI sites, creating the pMSG plasmid. This plasmid contains a maltose-binding protein as the N-extein and thioredoxin as the C-extein. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the sequence of all plasmids. To create the Ssp GyrB split intein plasmid pMSG-S11, a spacer sequence was inserted into the mini-intein coding sequence at the S11 split site by inverse PCR as described previously (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The spacer DNA sequentially contains a stop codon, a ribosome binding site, and a start codon and has the following sequence: 5′-TAA TTA ACT TAT AAG GAG GAA AAA CAT ATG-3′. This creates a two-gene operon where the N-protein containing the maltose-binding protein and N-intein is followed by the C-protein containing the C-intein and thioredoxin. A plasmid (pMSG-S11inv) with the N- and C-proteins in the reverse order was modified from pMSG-S11. This was done through circularization of the PCR-amplified two-gene operon from pMSG-S11 followed by linearization at the S11 split site and ligation into a modified pMST-plasmid (lacking extein proteins) at introduced EcoRI and BamHI sites. To produce a plasmid expressing the N-protein only (pMINH), the coding sequence of a His tag (six histidines) was added to the 3′ end of the IN coding sequence through inverse PCR using the primer pair 5′-CAT CAC CAC CAT CAC CAT TAA TTA ACT TAT AAG GAG GAA AAA CAT ATG-3′ and 5′-CGT TGC CAA AGC AAA ATT GTG-3′, and the C-protein was deleted from the pMSG-S11 plasmid through digestion with NdeI-HindIII followed by filling in and blunt-end ligation. Protein Splicing in E. coli cells-Each expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli cells (DH5α strain). Subsequent protein expression, gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to late log phase (A600 = 0.5), IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to induce protein expression for 3 h at 37 °C or for ∼16 h at room temperature, cells were harvested and lysed in an SDS- and DTT-containing buffer in a boiling water bath, total cellular proteins were analyzed through SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Western blotting was carried out with either anti-maltose-binding protein monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) or anti-thioredoxin monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the protein band was estimated using a gel documentation system (Gel Doc 1000 coupled with Molecular Analyst software, Bio-Rad). In Vitro Protein-Peptide trans-Splicing-The N-precursor protein (MINH) was expressed in E. coli as above and affinity-purified using amylose resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs). The synthetic peptide (ICF) was purchased from EZBiolab. For in vitro trans-splicing, 20 μm MINH protein was incubated with 200 μm ICF peptide in a splicing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA; pH 8.0) in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm TCEP or 1.0 mm DTT at room temperature for a specified length of time. Splicing products were analyzed through SDS-PAGE in the presence of DTT and visualized either by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or by Western blotting using an anti-maltose-binding protein antibody (see above), an anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), or an anti-His tag antibody (Roche Applied Science). Construction of the S11 Split Inteins-Nine natural inteins were tested to find a functional split site proximal to the C terminus of the intein sequence. They were the Ssp GyrB, Tth DnaE-1, Tth DnaE-2, Tth RIR, CneA Prp8, Ter RIR-1, Ter RIR-2, Ter RIR-3, and Ter RIR-4 inteins. These natural inteins all have contiguous sequences (8Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and the last five have previously been shown to be active in cis-splicing (23Liu X.Q. Yang J. Meng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46826-46831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 24Liu X.Q. Yang J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Working from the coding sequence of each intein, the homing endonuclease domain sequence (if present) was deleted to produce a mini-intein, based on previously described domain predictions (8Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 25Pietrokovski S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Dalgaard J.Z. Moser M.J. Hughey R. Mian I.S. J. Comput. Biol. 1997; 4: 193-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Each mini-intein sequence was then split at the S11 site to produce the split intein. The S11 site was chosen through protein sequence alignments with inteins of known crystal structures such that the S11 site was near the C terminus and between the last two β-strands, β11 and β12. An example of the sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 1, where the Ssp GyrB mini-intein is aligned to the Ssp DnaB mini-intein, which has a known crystal structure (7Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The S11 split intein constructs were expressed in E. coli using the previously described pMST plasmid (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 2A, each intein was flanked by a maltose-binding protein (M) as the N-extein and a thioredoxin (T) as the C-extein, expressed from an IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter. For the S11 split intein, the intein coding sequence was split at the S11 site to create a two-gene operon by adding a spacer sequence containing sequentially a stop codon, a ribosome binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence), and a start codon. In this operon, the first gene encoded the N-precursor protein consisting of the M sequence (N-extein) followed by the N-terminal intein piece (N-intein or IN), and the second gene encoded the C-precursor protein consisting of the C-terminal intein piece (C-intein or IC) followed by the T sequence as C-extein. Similar gene constructs had been used in previous studies of split inteins (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Liu X.Q. Yang J. Meng Q. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 572: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), which allowed easy expression and identification of the protein products. Splicing Activities in E. coli-The above plasmids were introduced into E. coli cells to produce the corresponding proteins after IPTG induction, the resulting total cellular proteins were resolved through SDS-PAGE, and relevant protein bands were identified by their predicted sizes and through Western blotting. Proteins were quantified by measuring the intensity of the corresponding signal on Western blots, and the efficiency of splicing was calculated as the ratio of the spliced protein over the total protein (the spliced protein plus the remaining precursor protein). The C-precursor protein was used in estimating the efficiency of trans-splicing because the N-precursor protein existed in excessive amounts due to its higher expression level as the first gene of the two-gene operon, with the exception of the pMSG-S11inv plasmid. Among all the S11 split intein constructs tested, only the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein showed a trans-splicing activity in E. coli. The spliced protein (MT) was clearly observed after Coomassie Blue staining and confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 2B), indicating that protein trans-splicing had occurred. A certain amount of the C-precursor protein (ICT) remained, indicating that the trans-splicing reaction did not go to completion. The efficiency (completeness) of the trans-splicing was estimated to be 84% at room temperature but only 16% at 37 °C. The remote possibility of cis-splicing via translational readthrough of the two-gene operon was also investigated. When the gene order in the two-gene operon was reversed in plasmid pMSG-S11inv, making cis-splicing topologically impossible, the spliced protein was still observed (Fig. 2B), thereby ruling out this possibility. Additional tested S11 split inteins, derived from the other eight natural inteins beside the Ssp GyrB intein (see above), did not show a detectable amount of trans-splicing under the tested conditions (data not shown). Protein-Peptide trans-Splicing in Vitro-The Ssp GyrB S11 split intein was tested in vitro to trans-splice a recombinant N-precursor protein with a synthetic peptide (Fig. 3A). The N-precursor protein MINH consisted of a maltose-binding protein (M), the N-intein (IN), and a His tag sequence (H). The synthetic peptide (ICF) is 30 aa in length with the following sequence: GVFVHNSADYKDDDDKSGCLAGDTLITLAS. It contains the IC sequence (GVFVHN) followed by a C-extein, and the C-extein sequence starts with a serine residue required for splicing and contains the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) for easy detection. If the trans-splicing occurs, the FLAG-containing C-extein (F) will be transferred onto the C terminus of the maltose-binding protein (M), producing the spliced protein (MF). Simultaneously, the N-intein piece (INH) will be released from the precursor protein, and the C-intein (IC) will be released from the synthetic ICF peptide. The predicted products of the above protein-peptide trans-splicing were observed after Coomassie Blue staining and identified through Western blotting (Fig. 3B). As expected, the spliced protein MF was recognized by both anti-M and anti-F antibodies, the N-terminal intein piece INH was recognized only by the anti-H antibody, and the N-precursor protein MINH was recognized by both anti-M and anti-H antibodies. This trans-splicing reaction was enhanced by the addition of reducing agents (TCEP and DTT), as indicated by the increased amounts of the spliced protein (Fig. 3B). Over 80% of the N-precursor protein was converted into the spliced protein in the presence of 1 mm DTT after 11 h of incubation with the synthetic peptide (Fig. 4A). A minor protein band corresponding to the M part of the N-precursor protein (MINH) was also observed, suggesting that a small amount of the N-precursor protein underwent N-cleavage (i.e. peptide bond breakage at N terminus of the IN sequence) instead of trans-splicing. The rate constant of the above trans-splicing reaction was also determined for comparison with conventional split inteins. The purified N-precursor protein was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of the ICF peptide to achieve a pseudo-first order reaction regarding the N-precursor protein. The reaction products were resolved through SDS-PAGE, visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and quantified through laser scanning and gel documentation. The amount of the spliced product was calculated as a percentage of the starting amount of N-precursor protein. The percentage of spliced product formation was plotted against time from a series of measurements over a 31-h period (Fig. 4B). The plot was fitted to the pseudo-first order reaction equation of p = P0(1-e–kt) (28Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and the rate constant (kobs) was determined to be (6.9 ± 2.2) × 10–5 s–1. We have succeeded for the first time in constructing a novel S11 split intein capable of protein trans-splicing after testing nine different natural inteins by splitting the intein sequences at the S11 site near the C terminus. For a trans-splicing reaction to occur, the two precursor proteins must be able to recognize and associate with one another. The exteins used in this study, maltose-binding protein and thioredoxin, do not interact structurally and cannot play a role in bringing together the two precursor proteins. Therefore the intein fragments (IN and IC) must be solely responsible for the recognition and association between the two precursor proteins in vivo or between the N-precursor protein and the short peptide in vitro. Interestingly, the functional association between the IN and the IC appears to be a rare property of the S11 split intein derived from the Ssp GyrB intein because similarly constructed S11 split inteins derived from nine other natural inteins did not show a trans-splicing activity in this study and in a previous report (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is striking that the 6-aa IC could associate with the 150-aa IN to reconstitute an active intein. The structural basis of this IN-IC association may be considered in terms of the highly conserved crystal structures of inteins in general, although no crystal structure is available for the Ssp GyrB intein. The highly conserved mini-intein structure typically consists of ∼12 β-strands (4Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 5Ichiyanagi K. Ishino Y. Ariyoshi M. Komori K. Morikawa K. J. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and the 6-aa IC sequence corresponds to the last β-strand β12 in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein (Fig. 1). In the disk-like structure of the mini-intein, β12 is located inside the centrally positioned catalytic pocket of the intein, and it interacts directly with β11 to form a short anti-parallel β-sheet. This may explain the intermolecular association between IN and IC of the S11 split intein because the IC contains β12, whereas the IN contains β11 and other parts of the catalytic pocket. The in vitro trans-splicing conditions allowed for an analysis of the reaction kinetics of the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein. The observed rate constant of (6.9 ± 2.2) × 10–5 s–1 is close or comparable with previously reported rate constants of the conventional and the S1 split inteins. The Ssp DnaB S1 split intein, whose split site is near the N-terminal of intein (21Sun W. Yang J. Liu X.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35281-35286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), exhibited a rate constant of (4.1 ± 0.2) × 10–5 s–1 (22Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conventional split inteins, whose split sites are near the middle of the intein and correspond to the insertion site of the homing endonuclease domain, exhibited rate constants ranging from ∼10–4 s–1 for the synthetic Ssp DnaB split intein (27Brenzel S. Kurpiers T. Mootz H.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to ∼10–5 s–1 for the naturally occurring Ssp DnaE split intein (28Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition to trans-splicing, a small amount of N-cleavage (at the N terminus of IN) was observed for the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein when DTT was present. This is not surprising because strong nucleophilic compounds such as DTT are known to resolve ester bonds formed during the first two steps (N–S/ N–O acyl shift and transesterification) of protein splicing, which cleaves the N-extein off the precursor protein. However, only ∼10% N-cleavage occurred along with the ∼75% trans-splicing, which compares favorably with the Ssp DnaB S1 split intein that showed ∼40% cleavage along with ∼40% trans-splicing under similar in vitro conditions (22Ludwig C. Pfeiff M. Linne U. Mootz H.D. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2006; 45: 5218-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The demonstration of in vitro trans-splicing between a protein and a peptide, using the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein, potentially presents a new and useful method for protein research and biotechnology. A synthetic peptide can easily be made to contain the 6-aa IC and a C-extein to be spliced onto the C terminus of an IN-containing target protein. The C-extein in this study contained a FLAG epitope for easy analysis but can potentially contain any synthetic moiety one might wish to splice onto the C terminus of a target protein. For example, the synthetic C-extein may contain biotin, fluorescent groups, modified or unnatural amino acids, and drug molecules. The only known requirement is that the C-extein begins with a nucleophilic amino acid residue (Ser, Cys, or Thr), although it is possible that other features of the C-extein might influence the efficiency of the trans-splicing reaction. The ∼80% trans-splicing efficiency of the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein is comparable with or higher than previously reported trans-splicing efficiencies of conventional and S1 split inteins. Unlike previously reported split inteins, the Ssp GyrB S11 split intein may be uniquely or most suitable for splicing synthetic chemical groups onto the C terminus of recombinant proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2085873095,"Microtubules are cytoskeletal components involved in multiple cell functions such as mitosis, motility, or intracellular traffic. In vivo, these polymers made of alphabeta-tubulin nucleate mostly from the centrosome to establish the interphasic microtubule network or, during mitosis, the mitotic spindle. Centrosomal P4.1-associated protein (CPAP; also named CENPJ) is a centrosomal protein involved in the assembly of centrioles and important for the centrosome function. This protein contains a microtubule-destabilizing region referred to as PN2-3. Here we decrypt the microtubule destabilization activity of PN2-3 at the molecular level and show that it results from the sequestration of tubulin by PN2-3 in a non-polymerizable 1:1 complex. We also map the tubulin/PN2-3 interaction both on the PN2-3 sequence and on the tubulin surface. NMR and CD data on free PN2-3 in solution show that this is an intrinsically unstructured protein that comprises a 23-amino acid residue alpha-helix. This helix is embedded in a 76-residue region that interacts strongly with tubulin. The interference of PN2-3 with well characterized tubulin properties, namely GTPase activity, nucleotide exchange, vinblastine-induced self-assembly, and stathmin family protein binding, highlights the beta subunit surface located at the intermolecular longitudinal interface when tubulin is embedded in a microtubule as a tubulin/PN2-3 interaction area. These findings characterize the PN2-3 fragment of CPAP as a protein with an unprecedented tubulin sequestering mechanism distinct from that of stathmin family proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2006182924,"Expression and signaling of CD30, a tumor necrosis factor receptor family member, is up-regulated in numerous lymphoid-derived neoplasias, most notably anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. To gain insight into the mechanism of CD30 signaling, we used an affinity purification strategy that led to the identification of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) as a CD30-interacting protein that modulated the activity of the RelB subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). ALCL cells that were deficient in ARNT exhibited defects in RelB recruitment to NF-κB–responsive promoters, whereas RelA recruitment to the same sites was potentiated, resulting in the augmented expression of these NF-κB–responsive genes. These findings indicate that ARNT functions in concert with RelB in a CD30-induced negative feedback mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2084230972,"Photocatalysis of titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) substrates is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Anion-doped TiO(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination, relative environmentally-friendly materials. Their anti-spore activity against Bacillus anthracis, however, remains to be investigated. We evaluated these visible-light activated photocatalysts on the reduction of anthrax spore-induced pathogenesis.Standard plating method was used to determine the inactivation of anthrax spore by visible light-induced photocatalysis. Mouse models were further employed to investigate the suppressive effects of the photocatalysis on anthrax toxin- and spore-mediated mortality. We found that anti-spore activities of visible light illuminated nitrogen- or carbon-doped titania thin films significantly reduced viability of anthrax spores. Even though the spore-killing efficiency is only approximately 25%, our data indicate that spores from photocatalyzed groups but not untreated groups have a less survival rate after macrophage clearance. In addition, the photocatalysis could directly inactivate lethal toxin, the major virulence factor of B. anthracis. In agreement with these results, we found that the photocatalyzed spores have tenfold less potency to induce mortality in mice. These data suggest that the photocatalysis might injury the spores through inactivating spore components.Photocatalysis induced injuries of the spores might be more important than direct killing of spores to reduce pathogenicity in the host."

Because both of these enzymes have evolved from different origins to acquire the same catalytic function, these two enzymes are considered to be a new example of functional convergence (38Urade Y.

Inorganic quadrivalent selenium (Se4+) compounds are known to be noncompetitive and reversible inhibitors of L-PGDS (40Islam F. Watanabe Y. Morii H. Hayaishi O. Arch. Biochem.

We recently found that 4-benzhydryloxy-1-(3-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-propyl)-piperidine (HQL-79; Fig. 1) is an orally active and selective inhibitor of H-PGDS (42Aritake K. Kado Y. Inoue T. Miyano M. Urade Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15277-15286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because L-PGDS catalyzes the same reaction as H-PGDS, we suspected that some derivative(s) of HQL-79 might have an inhibition activity toward L-PGDS. Among various tetrazol compounds, we found that 4-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene-1-[4-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-butyl]-piperidine (AT-56; Fig. 1) is a specific inhibitor of L-PGDS (43Fujimori K. Aritake K. Urade Y. Gene (Amst.). 2008; 426: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), having a higher potency and biological availability than seleno-compounds in vivo. In the present study, we characterized AT-56 and found it to be a competitive inhibitor of L-PGDS against PGH2 by kinetic analysis and also used NMR analysis to determine the binding mode of AT-56 to L-PGDS. In addition we found that AT-56 inhibited the production of PGD2 by L-PGDS-expressing cultured cells, H-PGDS gene knock-out (KO) mice, and human L-PGDS overexpressing transgenic (TG) mice. Chemicals-AT-56 was a generous gift from TAIHO Pharmaceutical Company (Saitama, Japan). AT-56 was dissolved in DMSO for in vitro experiments and in 0.5% methylcellulose for oral administration to mice, due to its high lipophilicity. In aqueous solution, the maximum solubility of AT-56 was determined to be 90 μm in saline containing 1% DMSO and 260 μm in 10% DMSO, as determined by UV absorption at 287 nm. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Wako (Osaka, Japan), unless otherwise specified. Purification of Human CSF L-PGDS (β-Trace) and Recombinant Mouse L-PGDS-Human CSF L-PGDS (β-trace) was purified from human CSF, which was donated by Dr. M. Mase (Nagoya City University Hospital), as reported (36Kanekiyo T. Ban T. Aritake K. Huang Z.L. Qu W.M. Okazaki I. Mohri I. Murayama S. Ozono K. Taniike M. Goto Y. Urade Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 6412-6417Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA for mouse L-PGDS, which is composed of 189 amino acid residues (GenBank™ accession number X89222), was ligated into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the expression vector pGEX-2T plasmid (GE Healthcare). The N-terminal 22-amino acid residues of the signal peptide were deleted, and the C89A/C186A- and W54A-substituted recombinant enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using a QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The recombinant enzymes retained PGDS activity comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme and were stable for long term use. The mutated L-PGDS was expressed as a GSH transferase fusion protein, purified by column chromatography with GSH-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare), and eluted from the column by incubation with thrombin (100 units/100 μl of resin), as reported previously (44Inui T.

The recombinant protein was further purified to apparent homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography with Superdex 75 in 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). Fluorescence Quenching Assays-13-cis-Retinoic acid and AT-56 were dissolved in DMSO to give a 2 mm stock solution. Various concentrations of 13-cis-retinoic acid and AT-56 in 10 μl of DMSO were added to the L-PGDS solution in 990 μl of 5 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0). After incubation at room temperature for 60 min, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was detected with an FP-750 spectrofluorometer (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) at an excitation wavelength at 282 nm and an emission wavelength at 338 nm, as reported previously (44Inui T.

The activities of COX-1 and COX-2 were measured as described earlier (48Yamamoto S. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 86: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with 50 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid (PerkinElmer) used as a substrate in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 μm hematin, 5 mm l-tryptophan, 0.1 mg/ml IgG, and 10% DMSO. The products were separated by thin layer chromatography. The conversion rate from 14C-labeled substrate to 14C-labeled products was calculated by using an imaging plate system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The kinetic constants were determined by Lineweaver-Burk plots prepared with SigmaPlot software (version 10.0 for Windows; Systat Software, Inc.). NMR Titration Experiment-The NMR samples of mouse L-PGDS were prepared in a mixture of 50 mm sodium phosphate in 75% H2O, 15% D2O, 10% DMSO at pH 7.0, as reported previously (49Shimamoto S. Yoshida T. Inui T. Gohda K. Kobayashi Y. Fujimori K. Tsurumura T. Aritake K. Urade Y. Ohkubo T. J. Biol.

The protein concentration was adjusted to ∼1 mm in a 5-mm microcell NMR tube (Shigemi, Tokyo, Japan) for NMR experiments. NMR experiments were performed at 27.5 °C by using an INOVA600 spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with shielded gradient triple resonance probes (49Shimamoto S. Yoshida T. Inui T. Gohda K.

The binding of L-PGDS to AT-56 was monitored by NMR titration of 15N-labeled L-PGDS with unlabeled ligands by using 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiments. The combined 1H and 15N chemical shift changes over the range of the titration from 0 to 2.0 equivalents of AT-56 were plotted. The composite chemical shift differences were calculated according to the empirical equation Δδtot = {(ΔδHN × WHN)2 + (ΔδN × WN)2}½, where ΔδHN and ΔδN are the chemical shift changes of 1H and 15N, respectively. The weighting factors used were WHN = 1 and WN = 0.2. PG Production by Cultured Cells-L-PGDS-expressing human medulloblastoma TE-671 cells and H-PGDS-possessing human megakaryoblastic MEG-01S cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. TE-671 (1 × 106 cells/well) and MEG-01S (5 × 105/well) cells were seeded into multiplates and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate under a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. MEG-01S cells were caused to differentiate by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate to express H-PGDS and COX-1, as described previously (50Mahmud I. Ueda N. Yamaguchi H. Yamashita R. Yamamoto S. Kanaoka Y. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28263-28266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After the cells had been cultured for 1 day, AT-56 was added to them at different doses ranging from 0 to 100 μm, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, they were stimulated with a calcium ionophore, A23187 (5 μm), at 37 °C for 15 min. The culture media were harvested and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove the cells, and the supernatant was removed and stored at –80 °C until the measurements of PGs could be made. In some experiments, these cells were prelabeled with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (3.7 kBq/well) for 12 h before the assay. PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α in the culture medium were quantified as described below. PG Production by Stab Wound Brain Injury-The protocols used for all animal experiments in this study were approved by the Animal Research Committee of the Osaka Bioscience Institute. H-PGDS KO mice (14–16-week-old males or females weighing 25–30 g, C57BL/6 strain) (2Qu W.M. Huang Z.L. Xu X.H. Aritake K. Eguchi N. Nambu F. Narumiya S. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

AT-56 of various doses (1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg body weight) was administered orally to H-PGDS KO mice 1 h before the stab wound injury. Under pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) anesthesia, a 25-gauge needle was inserted into the frontal cortex of the brain of H-PGDS KO mice at a position 2 mm caudal to the bregma, 2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture, and 1 mm deep. After the needle had been withdrawn, the brains were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a deep freezer (–80 °C) until the measurements of PG contents could be made. Measurement of PG Contents-The amounts of PGs in the cell culture media and brain tissues were determined as described previously (22Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell culture media and the frozen brain tissues were homogenized in ethanol containing 0.02% HCl at pH 2.0 and [3H]PGD2, [3H]PGE2, and [3H]PGF2α (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as tracers to estimate the recovery during the purification procedure. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 20 min, the ethanol extracts were applied onto Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters Associates, Milford, MA), washed with hexane, eluted with ethyl acetate, and fractionated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amounts of PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2α were measured by using their respective enzyme immunoassay kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), according to the manufacturer's instructions. L-PGDS-mediated Allergic Airway Inflammation-Human L-PGDS-overexpressing TG mice (14–16-week-old males weighing 25–30 g, FVB strain (22Pinzar E. Kanaoka Y. Inui T. Eguchi N. Urade Y. Hayaishi O.

A. 2000; 97: 4903-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar)) were actively sensitized by an intraperitoneal injection of 10 μg of ovalbumin (Sigma) in 0.2 ml of aluminum hydroxide gel (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) on days 0 and 14 and then exposed to aerosolized ovalbumin (50 mg/ml in sterile saline) for 20 min on day 21 (52Fujitani Y. Kanaoka Y. Aritake K. Uodome N. Okazaki-Hatake K. Urade Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At 2 days after the ovalbumin challenge, the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected as reported previously (52Fujitani Y. Kanaoka Y. Aritake K. Uodome N. Okazaki-Hatake K. Urade Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Total and differential cell counts (500 cells) were obtained based on standard morphologic criteria after the cells had been cytospun onto glass slides and stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Diagnostics). Pharmacokinetics of AT-56-Male C57BL/6 mice (7 weeks old, weighing 22–26 g; Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were given a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg AT-56 or a single intravenous dose of 2 mg/kg AT-56. Plasma was collected after euthanasia from 3 mice/group at 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h for oral administration and 5 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after intravenous dosing. Whole blood sample was collected into a heparinized syringe at each time point. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation and was stored at –30 °C until analysis. Concentrations of AT-56 in plasma were determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Samples were separated by chromatography with a Cadenza HS-C18 column (2 mm × 150 mm; Imtact Corp., Kyoto, Japan) at a column temperature of 33 °C with a 5–90% acetonitrile gradient in 0.02% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min for 12 min. Injection volume was 10 μl. AT-56 was detected by mass spectrometry with the system (Waters Associates) composed of the 2695 separation module, 996 photodiode array detector, and ZQ-4000 mass spectrometry detector with an electrospray ionization source. The electrospray ionization interface was operated at a source temperature of 115 °C and a desolvation temperature of 350 °C. Cone gas and desolvation gas flow were 124 and 606 liters/h, respectively. Cone voltage for AT-56 was positive 33 V for m/z = 398. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis with WinNonlin, version 5.0.1 (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA). Statistics-Comparisons were analyzed for statistical significance by Dunnett's multicomparison test using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, CA). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Inhibition of the L-PGDS Activity by AT-56-AT-56 inhibited the PGDS activity of both β-trace purified from human CSF and purified recombinant mouse L-PGDS C89A/C186A mutant in a concentration (10–250 μm)-dependent manner. The L-PGDS activity of both preparations was inhibited to 30% with 250 μm AT-56, and the IC50 value was calculated to be 95 μm. However, the activities of the purified COX-1, COX-2, m-PGES-1, or H-PGDS in the arachidonate cascade were not significantly affected by AT-56 up to 250 μm (Fig. 2A). Kinetic experiments revealed that AT-56 inhibited the recombinant L-PGDS in a competitive manner against the substrate PGH2, as shown in Lineweaver-Burk plots (Fig. 2B), in which the Vmax value remained unchanged but the Km value increased when the AT-56 concentration was increased (0–120 μm). The apparent Ki value of AT-56 was calculated to be 75 μm, which was 5.3-fold higher than the Km value of the L-PGDS activity for PGH2 (14 μm) in the presence of 10% DMSO. Binding Interaction between L-PGDS and AT-56 Analyzed by NMR-We have previously determined the NMR structure of the mouse L-PGDS C89A/C186A mutant (49Shimamoto S. Yoshida T. Inui T. Gohda K.

The interaction sites of L-PGDS with AT-56 were determined by the chemical shift perturbation method (53Craik D.J. Wilce J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 195-232PubMed Google Scholar) based on the two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra of L-PGDS after the successive addition of AT-56 (Fig. 3). Upon AT-56 binding, large changes (>0.08 ppm) of chemical shift were observed at several amino acid residues of L-PGDS (i.e. Ser52, Thr80, Met94, and His116) (Fig. 3A). These residues are located at the upper part of the central cavity of the β-barrel structure of the L-PGDS molecule (Protein Data Bank code 2E4J; Fig. 3B), in which the PGH2-binding site containing the catalytic center of Cys65 is located (49Shimamoto S.

https://openalex.org/W2057508202,"Fat1, an atypical cadherin induced robustly after arterial injury, has significant effects on mammalian vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth and migration. The related Drosophila protein Fat interacts genetically and physically with Atrophin, a protein essential for development and control of cell polarity. We hypothesized that interactions between Fat1 and mammalian Atrophin (Atr) proteins might contribute to Fat1 effects on VSMCs. Like Fat1, mammalian Atr expression increased after arterial injury and in VSMCs stimulated with growth and chemotactic factors including angiotensin II, basic fibroblast growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor BB. Two distinct Atr2 transcripts, atr2L and atr2S, were identified by Northern analysis; in VSMCs, atr2S mRNA expression was more responsive to stimuli. By immunocytochemistry, Fat1 and Atrs colocalized at cell-cell junctions, in the perinuclear area, and in the nucleus. In coimmunoprecipitation studies, Fat1 interacted with both Atr1 and Atr2; these interactions required Fat1 amino acids 4300-4400 and an intact Atro-box in the Atrs. Knock-down of Atrs by small interfering RNA did not affect VSMC growth but had complex effects on migration, which was impaired by Atr1 knockdown, enhanced by Atr2L knockdown, and unchanged when both Atr2S and Atr2L were depleted. Enhanced migration caused by Atr2L knockdown required Fat1 expression. Similarly, orientation of cells after monolayer denudation was impaired in cells with Atr1 knockdown but enhanced in cells selectively depleted of Atr2L. Together these findings suggest that Fat1 and Atrs act in concert after vascular injury but show further that distinct Atr isoforms have disparate effects on VSMC directional migration."

Valuable insight into the orthosteric ligand binding to nAChRs in recent years has been obtained from the crystal structures of acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) that share significant sequence homology with the amino-terminal domains of the nAChRs. α-Conotoxins, which are isolated from the venom of carnivorous marine snails, selectively inhibit the signaling of neuronal nAChR subtypes. Co-crystal structures of α-conotoxins in complex with AChBP show that the side chain of a highly conserved proline residue in these toxins is oriented toward the hydrophobic binding pocket in the AChBP but does not have direct interactions with this pocket. In this study, we have designed and synthesized analogues of α-conotoxins ImI and PnIA[A10L], by introducing a range of substituents on the Pro6 residue in these toxins to probe the importance of this residue for their binding to the nAChRs. Pharmacological characterization of the toxin analogues at the α7 nAChR shows that although polar and charged groups on Pro6 result in analogues with significantly reduced antagonistic activities, analogues with aromatic and hydrophobic substituents in the Pro6 position exhibit moderate activity at the receptor.

Engel A.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 455-463Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar). As presynaptic heteroreceptors, nAChRs regulate the release of several important neurotransmitters, including dopamine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid. Postsynaptic nAChRs are crucial mediators of the fast excitatory cholinergic neurotransmission in the central and peripheral nervous systems, which also influence the activity in several other important neurotransmitter systems (2Jensen A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 3Sher E. Chen Y. Sharples T.J. Broad L.M. Benedetti G. Zwart R. McPhie G.I. Pearson K.H. Baldwinson T. DeFillipi G. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The nAChRs are pentameric complexes composed of combinations of α1-10, β1-4, δ, and ∈/γ subunits, each consisting of an extracellular ligand binding domain, four transmembrane helices, and an extended intracellular region arranged around a central cation-conducting pore (2Jensen A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Muscle-type nAChRs are composed of two α1-subunits and β1-, δ-, and ∈/γ-subunits, whereas neuronal nAChRs are either heteromeric combinations of α2-6- and β2-4-subunits, α9α10 complexes, or homomeric complexes consisting exclusively of α7- or α9-subunits (4Lukas R.J. Changeux J.-P. Le Novere N. Albuquerque E.X. Balfour D.J.K. Berg D.K. Bertrand D. Chiappinelli V.A. Clarke P.B.S. Collins A.C. Dani J.A. Grady S.R. Kellar K.J. Lindstrom J.M. Marks M.J. Quik M. Taylor P.W. Wonnacott S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 397-401PubMed Google Scholar). The different nAChR subtypes are involved in a wide range of distinct physiological functions, and the vast multitude of different subunit combinations underlines the importance of developing subtype-specific ligands for nAChRs as tools for studying cholinergic neurotransmission and for determining the involvement of specific nAChR subtypes in pathological states. α-Conotoxins are peptide neurotoxins isolated from the venom of carnivorous marine snails, and several of these have been identified as potent and selective inhibitors of specific nAChR subtypes (Table 1) (5Armishaw C.J. Alewood P.F. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2005; 6: 221-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). They are competitive antagonists acting at the orthosteric site (i.e. the binding site for the endogenous agonist) of the nAChR. Several α-conotoxins have shown promising therapeutic potential, the most prominent example being α-conotoxin Vc1.1 (also known as ACV1), which is currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of neuropathic pain (6Satkunanathan N. Livett B. Gayler K. Sandall D. Down J. Khalil Z. Brain Res. 2005; 1059: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 7Livett B.G. Sandall D.W. Keays D. Down J. Gayler K.R. Satkunanathan N. Khalil Z. Toxicon. 2006; 48: 810-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Structurally, α-conotoxins are relatively small in size (12-19 amino acid residues), and each peptide exhibits a well defined consensus fold containing a 310 helical region stabilized by two disulfide bonds giving rise to two loops of intervening amino acid residues denoted m and n, respectively (Fig. 1, A and B). The diversity of the amino acid residues within the m and n loops gives rise to the unique selectivity profiles displayed by the different α-conotoxins at the various nAChR subtypes. Another important structural feature of the α-conotoxins is the presence of a proline residue at a conserved position in the m loop (Table 1). In the majority of the α-conotoxins, this is the sixth residue, which we refer to as Pro6 in this study. Pro6 exists in the trans conformation and is conserved in nearly all α-conotoxins, the most notable exception being α-conotoxin ImII, which contains an arginine residue at this position. Pro6 is believed to induce the 310 helical turn in the peptide backbone exhibited by all α-conotoxins isolated to date (8Gehrmann J. Daly N.L. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In support of this role, substitutions of the residue with amino acids such as alanine have been found to lead to a dramatic loss of the nAChR activities of the α-conotoxins (9Quiram P.A. Sine S.M.

Extensive mutational studies of amino acid residues in α-conotoxins, as well as in nAChRs, have identified residues important for receptor/ligand interactions (2Jensen A. Frølund B. Liljefors T. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. J. Med. Chem. 2005; 48: 4705-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 15Quiram P.A. Sine S.M. J. Biol.

However, the understanding of the structural basis of α-conotoxin binding to nAChRs has increased considerably in recent years with the published x-ray crystal structures of acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) in complex with various α-conotoxins ligands, including ImI and PnIA[A10L,D14K] (17Celie P.H.N.

Additionally, AChBP was used to aid in the discovery of α-conotoxin TxIA, and a co-crystal structure of its more potent analogue TxIA[A10L] has been reported recently (20Dutertre S. Ulens C. Büttner R. Fish A. van Elk R. Kendel Y. Hopping G. Alewood P.F. Schroeder C. Nicke A. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Lewis R.J.

AChBPs display significant amino acid sequence homology with the amino-terminal ligand binding domain of nAChRs, and AChBPs form stable pentameric complexes characterized by binding affinities for nAChR ligands comparable with those exhibited by the homomeric α7 nAChR, hence they serve as good models for this receptor (24Smit A.B.

J. 2005; 88: 3286-3299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nAChR ligands have been shown to display different binding affinities for AChBPs from different species. For instance, α-conotoxin ImI exhibits a 16,000-fold greater affinity for the Ac-AChBP over Ls-AChBP (23Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). α-Conotoxins ImI and PnIA[A10L] are subtype-selective antagonists of the α7 nAChR, and for this reason both were selected for this study. Each differ in the number of amino acids in their m loop, with α-conotoxin ImI containing four and three amino acids, respectively, whereas α-conotoxin PnIA[A10L] contains four and seven residues in each respective loop. X-ray crystal structures of the two conotoxins complexed to Ac-AChBP indicate that the ligands inhibit α7 nAChR signaling via binding to the orthosteric sites at the interfaces of two subunits in the pentameric receptor complex, with the central α-helical region of the peptide protruding deep into the ligand-binding site (Fig. 1, C and D) (17Celie P.H.N. Kasheverov I.E. Mordintsev D.Y. Hogg R.C. van Nierop P. van Elk R. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Zhmak M.N. Bertrand D. Tsetlin V. Sixma T.K. Smit A.B. Nat. Struct. Mol.

A. 2006; 103: 3615-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A closer examination of the Ac-AChBP-α-conotoxin complexes reveals an open C loop and a cluster of hydrophobic residues consisting of Tyr93A and Trp147A in one subunit and Tyr55B and Ile116B in the adjacent subunit that forms the core of the ligand-binding site. Although α-conotoxin PnIA[A10L] forms primarily hydrophobic contacts in the binding pocket, α-conotoxin ImI forms an important salt bridge between Arg7 of α-conotoxin ImI and Asp197A in the primary subunit of the receptor (31Dutertre S. Lewis R.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other nicotinic ligands, α-conotoxins do not form hydrogen bonds or cation/π interactions with Trp147A, and they protrude less deeply into the pocket in comparison with ligands such as nicotine, lobeline, and methylcaconitine (MLA) (18Hansen S.B. Sulzenbacher G. Huxford T. Marchot P. Taylor P. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3635-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The aromatic cluster of the binding pocket is in close proximity to the conserved Pro6 residue, yet the proline residue does not appear to make any specific contacts in this area (Fig. 1, C and D). This study investigates the structure-activity relationships of two series of analogues of α-conotoxins ImI and PnIA[A10L] containing substituted proline derivatives in position 6 to gain further insights into the importance of the Pro6 residue in the two conotoxins with respect to their binding to nAChRs. After examination of the binding mode of α-conotoxins to the AChBPs, we hypothesize that additional interactions between α-conotoxins and the residues in the hydrophobic binding pocket of the nAChR could be achieved by incorporating a substituent into Pro6. In turn, this could result in α-conotoxin analogues with higher binding affinities and improved antagonistic potencies at the α7 nAChR. Furthermore, we have investigated the structural effects of various substituents on different positions on the Pro6 side chain and their impact on conformational and folding patterns of α-conotoxins by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy. Finally, we evaluated these observations in a structural context by generating a homology model of the orthosteric ligand-binding site of α7 nAChR and docking the α-conotoxin analogues into this model.

The construction of the α7/5-HT3A chimera has been described previously (38Jensen A.A. Mikkelsen I. Frølund B. Bräuner-Osborne H. Falch E. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). General-LC-MS spectrometry was performed using an Agilent 1200 series solvent delivery system equipped with an auto injector coupled to an Agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Gradients of 10% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.05% formic acid (buffer A) and 90% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.046% formic acid (buffer B) were employed with a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. A Zorbax C18 column (2.1 × 0.50-cm inner diameter, 2 μm) was used. Preparative RP-HPLC was performed using an Agilent 1100 series system using a Zorbax preparative RP-HPLC column (C18, 250 × 21.2 mm, 7 μm). Crude peptide dissolved in 2 ml of buffer A (10% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) was injected and eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 50% buffer B (90% aqueous acetonitrile + 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) over 50 min with a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Fractions were collected manually and analyzed by LC-MS to assess purity. Fractions found to contain pure peptide were pooled together and lyophilized. CD spectra were recorded on an OLIS-RSM1000 spectrometer (OLIS, Bogart, GA) between 185 and 260 nm at 20 °C. Samples were dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at a concentration of 30 μm. Peptide Synthesis-Peptides were assembled using Nα-Fmoc protection with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU)-mediated couplings with Rink-amide polystyrene resin (Multisyntech, Witten, Germany). For each conotoxin, the carboxyl-terminal region was assembled using a Liberty microwave peptide synthesizer (CEM, Matthews, NC) to the point of the Pro6 mutation. The peptide-resin was then split into equal portions, and the remainder of the peptides was assembled in parallel using a mini-block (Mettler-Toledo, Columbus, OH). Cleavage from the resin was performed in parallel by stirring the resin (∼100 mg) in a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triisopropylsilane/ethanedithiol (87.5:5:5:2.5) for 2 h at room temperature. The resin was filtered from the mixture, the solvent evaporated in vacuo, and the peptide precipitated with diethyl ether. The ether was triturated and the peptide dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and lyophilized. Assembly of betainamidyl analogues was performed by Boc-SPPS using methylbenzhydrylamine-resin (Peptides International, Louisville, KY). Fmoc-4-(RS)-(Boc-amino)proline was incorporated at position 6, and then betaine was coupled using HBTU, following deprotection of the 4-amino group with trifluoroacetic acid. The Nα-Fmoc protecting group was then removed using 20% piperidine, and assembly of the remaining peptide sequence was continued using Boc-SPPS. Cleavage was performed using HF/p-cresol/p-thiocresol (18:1:1) for 2 h at 0 °C using an HF cleavage apparatus (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan). Following cleavage, the HF was evaporated in vacuo, and the peptide was precipitated with cold diethyl ether, filtered, washed with additional ether, filtered again, dissolved away from the resin with buffer A, and then lyophilized. Oxidation and folding were achieved by dissolving the reduced peptide in a mixture of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.2) containing 50% 2-propanol to a concentration of ∼0.5 mm and stirring in an open vessel for 2 days at room temperature. The oxidation was monitored by LC-MS to ensure complete oxidation. The oxidation mixture was quenched by adjusting the solution to pH 2 with trifluoroacetic acid, and half the solvent was evaporated and lyophilized, and the oxidized product was purified by preparative RP-HPLC. Disulfide Bond Connectivity Determination-A modified reduction/alkylation strategy based on the method of Gray (39Gray W.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1732-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) was used. Partial reduction was achieved by incubating the peptide (50 μg) in 0.2 m citrate buffer (pH 3, 50 μl) with 50 eq of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride at 25 °C for 5 min, after which it was injected onto RP-HPLC (Zorbax C18 column, 2.1 × 0.50-cm inner diameter, 2 μm) and fractionated using a linear gradient. Fractions were analyzed by LC-MS, and those containing the partially reduced conotoxin (+2 atomic mass units) were pooled, lyophilized, dissolved in 50 mm N-phenylmaleimide in n-propyl alcohol (50 μl), and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to alkylate the free thiol groups on cysteine residues. The partially reduced/alkylated conotoxin was then isolated by RP-HPLC, and the remaining disulfide bonds were reduced by treatment with 50 eq of tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride in 0.2 m citrate for 16 h at 37 °C. The reduced/alkylated peptide was analyzed by tandem LC/MS to identify location of the two alkylated cysteine residues in the amino acid sequence. Structure Determination by NMR-NMR data for ImI[P6/5-(R)-Ph] was recorded on a sample dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at pH 3.5 using a Bruker ARX 600-MHz spectrometer. Two-dimensional NMR experiments included double quantum-filtered-correlation spectroscopy, E-correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy, with all spectra recorded at 280-290 K. Peak intensities from a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum with a mixing time of 200 ms at 290 K were used to determine distance restraints. Backbone dihedral restraints were determined from 3JHN-Hα coupling constants, and φ angles were restrained to -60 ± 30o for 3JHN-Hα < 5.8 Hz (Cys2, Cys3, Ser4, Arg7, Trp10, Arg11, and Cys12) and -120 ± 30o for 3JHN-Hα > 8.0 Hz (Cys8). Intra-residue nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and 3JHα-Hβ coupling patterns were used in assigning χ1 angle restraints of some side chains (Cys2, Cys3, Cys5, and Cys8).

The tsA-201 cells were maintained in culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum). The stable α4β2-, α3β4-, and α4β4-HEK293 cell lines were maintained in culture medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G-418 and the stable α7-GH3 cell line in culture medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml G-418. [3H]Methyllycaconitine Binding Assay-[3H]Methyllycaconitine ([3H]MLA) competition binding experiments with tsA-201 cells transiently transfected with the α7/5-HT3A chimera were performed essentially as described previously (38Jensen A.A.

The day after the transfection the culture medium on the cells was changed, and the following day the [3H]MLA binding assay was performed. Briefly, the cells were scraped into 30 ml of assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2)), homogenized using a Polytron for 10 s, and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g. The resulting pellet was homogenized in 30 ml of assay buffer and centrifuged again. The cell pellet was then resuspended in the assay buffer, and the membranes were incubated with 0.5 nm [3H]MLA and various concentrations of the test compounds. The total reaction volume was 600 μl, and nonspecific binding was determined in reactions with 5 mm (S)-nicotine. The assay mixtures were incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature while shaking. GF/C filters were pre-soaked for 1 h in a 0.2% polyethyleneimine solution, and binding was terminated by filtration through these filters using a 48-well cell harvester and washing three times with 4 ml of ice-cold isotonic NaCl solution. Following this, the filters were dried; 3 ml of Opti-Fluor™ (Packard Instrument Co.) was added, and the amount of bound radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. The fraction of specifically bound radioligand was always <5% of the total amount of radioligand. The binding experiments were performed in duplicate at least three times for each compound. [3H]Epibatidine Binding Assay-[3H]Epibatidine competition binding experiments with the stable α4β2-, α3β4-, and α4β4-HEK293 cell lines were performed essentially as described previously (38Jensen A.A.

Briefly, cells were harvested at 80-90% confluency and scraped into assay buffer (140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Mg2SO4, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)), homogenized using a Polytron for 10 s, and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in fresh assay buffer, homogenized, and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for another 20 min. Then the cell pellets were resuspended in the assay buffer, and the cell membranes were incubated with 25 pm [3H]epibatidine in the presence of various concentrations of compounds in a total assay volume of 1500 μl.

https://openalex.org/W2012478915,"Genetic studies in yeast have identified class E vps genes that form the ESCRT complexes required for protein sorting at the early endosome. In Drosophila, mutations of the ESCRT-II component vps25 cause endosomal defects leading to accumulation of Notch protein and increased Notch pathway activity. These endosomal and signaling defects are thought to account for several phenotypes. Depending on the developmental context, two different types of overgrowth can be detected. Tissue predominantly mutant for vps25 displays neoplastic tumor characteristics. In contrast, vps25 mutant clones in a wild-type background trigger hyperplastic overgrowth in a non-autonomous manner. In addition, vps25 mutant clones also promote apoptotic resistance in a non-autonomous manner.Here, we genetically characterize the remaining ESCRT-II components vps22 and vps36. Like vps25, mutants of vps22 and vps36 display endosomal defects, accumulate Notch protein and--when the tissue is predominantly mutant--show neoplastic tumor characteristics. However, despite these common phenotypes, they have distinct non-autonomous phenotypes. While vps22 mutations cause strong non-autonomous overgrowth, they do not affect apoptotic resistance. In contrast, vps36 mutations increase apoptotic resistance, but have little effect on non-autonomous proliferation. Further characterization reveals that although all ESCRT-II mutants accumulate Notch protein, only vps22 and vps25 mutations trigger Notch activity.The ESCRT-II components vps22, vps25 and vps36 display common and distinct genetic properties. Our data redefine the role of Notch for hyperplastic and neoplastic overgrowth in these mutants. While Notch is required for hyperplastic growth, it appears to be dispensable for neoplastic transformation."

Recently, we reported that expression of Fyn, a Src kinase, is heightened in CML cells and patient specimens and confers in vitro and in vivo proliferative advantages. Fyn is regulated by redox, and because BCR-ABL1 raises intracellular oxidant levels, which have been implicated in CML progression, we explored the molecular regulation of Fyn. Here we identify the transcription factors that drive redox- and BCR-ABL1-dependent Fyn expression. Promoter deletion analysis in 293T, BaF3, BaF3-p210, and K562 cells identified the region essential for basal transcriptional activity. Mutation of Sp1 and Egr1 binding sites within the essential region diminished Fyn promoter activity and identified Egr1 as conferring redox sensitivity. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed the binding of Sp1 and Egr1 to the promoter fragments. Importantly, knockdown of Sp1 or Egr1 with small interference RNA or inhibition of Sp1 binding by mithramycin A repressed Fyn protein expression. Our work is the first to define transcription factors that are responsible for endogenous, oxidative stress-dependent and BCR-ABL1-dependent Fyn expression.

The molecular defect responsible for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) 2The abbreviations used are: CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; siRNA, small interference RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PTP1B, protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B. is the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, which arises from a t(9;22) (q34;q11) reciprocal translocation commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome (1Nowell P.C. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2033-2035Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The encoded BCR-ABL1 kinase is a potent activator of numerous proliferative signaling pathways (2Arlinghaus R. Sun T. Cancer Treat. Res. 2004; 119: 239-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Improved understanding of this signaling network has enabled first and second generation kinase inhibitors to revolutionize the treatment of CML, particularly chronic phase disease (3Deininger M.W. Exp. Hematol. 2007; 35: 144-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the terminal blast crisis phase of the disease remains difficult to treat, and mutant forms of BCR-ABL1, particularly the T315I mutant, are refractory to all three of the currently FDA approved BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors (4Hochhaus A. Erben P. Ernst T. Mueller M.C. Semin. Hematol. 2007; 44: S15-S24Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 5Shah N.P. Sawyers C.L. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7389-7395Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).A less studied but intriguing feature of the BCR-ABL1 kinase is its ability to raise levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6Kim J.H. Chu S.C. Gramlich J.L. Pride Y.B. Babendreier E. Chauhan D. Salgia R. Podar K. Griffin J.D. Sattler M. Blood. 2005; 105: 1717-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Sattler M. Griffin J.D.

Further studies have shown that these ROS can lead to point mutations that confer resistance to imatinib mesylate (10Koptyra M. Falinski R. Nowicki M.O. Stoklosa T. Majsterek I. Nieborowska-Skorska M. Blasiak J. Skorski T. Blood. 2006; 108: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), the first FDA-approved BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitor, which is now frontline therapy for CML. Low levels of ROS, such as those stemming from BCR-ABL1, have been well documented to transducer mitogenic signals (11Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 247-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) and promote genomic instability (a feature seen in blast crisis CML) (12Penserga E.T. Skorski T. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because elucidation of signaling pathways in CML has impacted the treatment of this disease so significantly, further understanding of oxidant-dependent signaling (13Pendergast A.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 2002; 85: 51-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) will be useful in delineating new treatment strategies for refractory or progressed CML.Our recent work has highlighted a role for the up-regulation of the Src family member, Fyn, in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells and CML patient material (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M. Arlinghaus R.B. Chandra J. Blood. 2008; 111: 2904-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Knockdown of Fyn impacted in vitro and in vivo proliferation and caused increased sensitivity to imatinib. Fyn is ubiquitously expressed across tissue types and is among three Src family members known to be responsive to oxidative stress (15Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol.

The Fyn kinase has been extensively studied as promoting cell growth and differentiation in a number of signal transduction pathways, such as T cell receptor signaling, integrin-mediated signaling, cell adhesion, and hydrogen peroxide-mediated Ras activation (19Appleby M.W.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7990-8000Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). To date, only three studies (including ours) have examined the role of Fyn in BCR-ABL1-mediated signal transduction (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M.

In general, activation of Src family kinases has been targeted by therapeutics. Dasatinib, a dual Src/Abl inhibitor, has been approved for CML and demonstrates specificity for Fyn kinase activity (23Doggrell S.A. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2005; 14: 89-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Kamath A.V. Wang J. Lee F.Y. Marathe P.H. Cancer Chemother.

Science. 2004; 305: 399-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). In Philadelphia positive acute lymphocytic leukemia, Fyn was identified as a hub for signaling using gene expression and systems biology approaches (21Juric D. Lacayo N.J. Ramsey M.C. Racevskis J. Wiernik P.H. Rowe J.M. Goldstone A.H. O'Dwyer P.J. Paietta E. Sikic B.I. J. Clin. Oncol. 2007; 25: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Recently, an in vitro study using recombinant wild-type and mutant BCR-ABL1, demonstrated that Fyn can phosphorylate the SH3 or SH2 domain of BCR-ABL1 providing compelling evidence that Fyn may be upstream of BCR-ABL1, thereby initiating oncogenic kinase signaling (22Meyn 3rd, M.A. Wilson M.B. Abdi F.A. Fahey N. Schiavone A.P. Wu J. Hochrein J.M. Engen J.R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30907-30916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our published results confirmed this finding but also placed Fyn downstream of BCR-ABL1, because Fyn mRNA and protein expression is increased in a BCR-ABL1-dependent manner (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M. Arlinghaus R.B. Chandra J. Blood. 2008; 111: 2904-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These data suggest a cyclical model of Fyn up-regulation (driven by both BCR-ABL1 and oxidative stress) that could further promote BCR-ABL1 leukemogenesis. In keeping with this idea, we have reported increased Fyn expression in blast crisis CML patients as compared with chronic phase patients (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M. Arlinghaus R.B. Chandra J. Blood. 2008; 111: 2904-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data highlight an important role for increased Fyn expression as a feature of CML progression (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M. Arlinghaus R.B. Chandra J. Blood. 2008; 111: 2904-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); therefore, understanding the molecular basis for this up-regulation is necessary.The present study provides the first molecular description of regulation of the Fyn promoter, which lacks a TATA box but is characterized by several GC-rich regions. Endogenous, BCR-ABL-1-dependent, and oxidant-dependent Fyn expression were examined, and the transcription factors Sp1 and Egr1 were found to regulate expression of Fyn. Using antioxidants in combination with promoter mutation and Egr1 DNA binding assays, we found that Egr1 was responsible for oxidant-dependent up-regulation of Fyn. Interestingly, Egr1 itself is also increased in response to oxidative stress; thereby further piquing interest in understanding redox-modulated signaling in CML.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies and Chemicals-Monoclonal Fyn antibody was purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA); Egr1 and Sp1 polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), and mithramycin A were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (from donkey) and ECL plus Western blotting detection system were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Imatinib was kindly provided by Dr. Elisabeth Buchdunger at Novartis Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes were from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The psiCHECK-2 plasmid vector was purchased from Promega.Cell Lines-293T (an easily transfectable human kidney epithelial cell line expressing SV40 T-antigen) and K562 (human CML expressing p210 BCR-ABL1) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Murine growth factor-dependent pro-B lymphoid BaF3 cell lines transformed with vector (BaF3 vector), wild-type BCR-ABL1 (BaF3 p210) were kindly provided by Dr. Charles Sawyers. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. K562 and BaF3 cells were cultured in the log phase of cell growth by culture in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the BaF3 vector cells, 1 ng/ml interleukin-3 (purchased from Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and 2 μg/ml puromycin (purchased from Sigma Chemicals) were added.Measurement of Intracellular Peroxide Levels-Cells were incubated with dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at final concentrations of 10 μm, for 30 min at 37 °C (26Long J. Manchandia T. Ban K. Gao S. Miller C. Chandra J. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2007; 59: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured on the FL-1 channel of a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Data were analyzed using CellQuest Pro-analysis software (BD Biosciences).Measurement of Hydrogen Peroxide Released from Cells-Per the manufacturer’s directions, 60,000 cells were resuspended in 120 μl of reaction buffer containing 50 μm Amplex Red reagent, 0.1 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, 145 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm sodium phosphate, 4.86 mm KCl, 0.54 mm CaCl2, 1.22 mm MgSO4, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.35. Each sample was pipetted equally in quadruplet (120 μl/well) on a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Absorbance at 560 nm was monitored. For a standard curve, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 pmol of purified H2O2 were used, and an absorbance value of 0.003 was found to correspond with 1 pmol of H2O2.Western Blotting-Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100 with 1% protease inhibitor mixture and rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. Supernatants were obtained by centrifuging the samples at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. After boiling for 10 min in SDS sample buffer (containing 100 mm dithiothreitol), the samples were subjected to a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and the proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated at room temperature for 1 h in TBS-T blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk. Membranes were then probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody. Bound antibody was detected using a 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL-enhanced chemiluminescent reagents. The protein bands from at least three experiments per figure were analyzed by the Gel Documentation and Analysis System (Bio-Rad).Detection of Fyn mRNA-Total RNA of cells was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using an Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was used to amplify Fyn. Fyn mouse primer pair A was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cDNA generated from 0.2 μg of total RNA was added to 25 μl of iQ SYBR Green PCR master mix (Bio-Rad) with 200 nm primers and water to a total of 50 μl. PCR cycles were performed with the following temperature profile: 95 °C for 2 min, then 60 cycles consisting of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 1 min elongation at 72 °C, and finally, elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. Actin was amplified under the same conditions using the following primers: forward, 5′-TGTGCCCATCTACGAGGGGTATGC, and reverse, 5′-GGTACATGGTGGTGCCGCCAGACA. PCR products were then resolved on a 1% agarose gel. Expression of Fyn was analyzed by calculating Ct values and normalized to BaF3 vector Fyn expression.Cloning of Human Fyn Promoter Region DNA-The human Fyn promoter was cloned from K562 cells. The 3151-bp DNA (2268-bp upstream, 485-bp supposed first exon, and 398-bp intron) was cloned from genomic DNA by using primers GAGAGCATATGACACTTAGTC (forward) and GCATCAATTATTAAGTGATTACATC (reverse), which were designed based on the Human Chromosome 6 Project Genomic Sequences. The PCR conditions were: denaturing at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 68 °C for 3 min, and a final extension at 68 °C for 15 min. The DNA polymerase used was KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ). The PCR product was isolated by electrophoresis and ligated into the plasmid pCR2 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of the DNA in the pCR2 plasmid were determined by the 16-capillary genetic analyzer ABI 3100.Construction of Dual-luciferase Expression Plasmid pFynPromoterCheck Vector-Full-length and deletion constructs of the Fyn promoter (-2268/+883, -2000/-1, -2000/-501, -1500/-1, -1500/-501, -1000/-1, -1000/-501, -500/-1, -300/-1, -200/-1, -200/-51, -150/-1, -100/-1, and -50/-1 constructs) were generated by PCR with primers containing a BglII site and HindIII site (detailed in supplemental Table S1). The site-directed mutations in Sp1 A- and B-binding sites of the Fyn promoter were introduced into the -150/-1 and the -50/-1 constructs separately. A deletion mutant and a substitution mutant were generated in the -150/-1 construct for the Egr1 binding site; all mutants were made by PCR using the high fidelity KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) with primers listed in supplemental Table S2. As an internal control, we constructed the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids containing the firefly luciferase gene in the same plasmid thereby allowing normalization of the Renilla luciferase data. Three DNA fragments: a 4.6-kb XhoI/BglII DNA fragment from psiCHECK-2 plasmid (Promega), a 1.2-kb XhoI/HindIII DNA fragment from psiCHECK-2 plasmid, and various BglII/HindIII Fyn promoter DNA fragments of different lengths from the plasmid pCR2-3.1-kb full length, were ligated together to construct the dualluciferase (firefly and Renilla luciferases) expression plasmids. This vector, renamed pFynPromoterCheck, allows the Fyn promoter region DNA to function as the Renilla luciferase gene's promoter. As a separate positive control, the 0.4-kb SV40 early promoter was used.Transfection of Plasmid DNAs and siRNA and Dual-luciferase Assay-The dual-luciferase expression plasmid pFynPromoterCheck was transfected into 293T cells using the lipofection reagent, FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 97 μl of serum-free medium and 3 μl of the reagent were combined and vortexed. After 5 min at room temperature, 1 μg of plasmid DNA was added and vortexed for 1 s. The reagent-DNA complex was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then added to 1 million cells. Medium was changed after 6 h. For the K562 and BaF3 cells, transfections were performed using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleofector kit V and transfection programs T-16 and X-01 were used, respectively. Renilla and firefly luciferase activities were determined 24 h post transfection using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega) and the Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Pharmingen). The Renilla luciferase luminescence values were normalized to firefly luciferase luminescence values. The Sp1 siRNAs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, targeting mRNA sequence (GGAACAGAGUCCCAACAGU); the Egr1 siRNA were ordered from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO), targeting 4 mRNA sequences (GGACAUGACAGCAACCUUU, GUUACUACCUCUUAUCCAU, GAUGAACGCAAGAGGCAUA, and CCACAGGGCUUUCGGACAU); 10 μl of 10 μm siRNA duplex or control siRNA was transfected into 1 million cells. After 24 h, a second transfection was performed; and target RNA and protein assays were processed 24 h after the second transfection.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay-Nuclear extracts were prepared from 10 million K562 cells by washing the cells in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspending the cell pellet in 0.4 ml of a low salt buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with 1% protease inhibitor mixture) (27Chandra J. Niemer I. Gilbreath J. Kliche K.O. Andreeff M. Freireich E.J. Keating M. McConkey D.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These isolated nuclei were incubated on ice for 15 min, 20 μl of Nonidet P-40 was added, and the lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 s. Supernatants were discarded, and the nuclear pellets were re-suspended in 20 μl of a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with 1% protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclear lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 20 min with vortexing every 5 min. Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the protein concentration was measured in the supernatant by using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. The probes shown in supplemental Table S3 were prepared by annealing complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides, followed by end labeling with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and purification through a Sephadex G-25 column (Bio-Rad). EMSAs were performed according to the instructions for the Gel Shift Assay System (Promega). Reactions containing 18 μg of K562 nuclear extract, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC), with or without unlabeled competitor probes in binding buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Next, 0.2 ng of the labeled probes was added to the reaction, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min. For supershift assays, 1 μg of antibody was added 10 min before the addition of the labeled probes. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 1 h to overnight at -80 °C to obtain autoradiographs.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation-The assay was performed using an EZ ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) with the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 10 million K562 cells were cross-linked at 37 °C for 10 min in 1% formaldehyde, and then sonicated in buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.1), and 1% protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was divided into three tubes for subsequent immunoprecipitation. Dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture) was added to each tube, and protein A-Sepharose beads were added for preclearing. Lysates were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min, 5 μg of anti-Sp1, anti-Egr1, or rabbit IgG was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated on a rotator at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 1 min, the immune complex was sequentially washed with low salt buffer, high salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and TE buffer that were provided by the manufacturer. The immune complexes were eluted by rotation with 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linked immunoprecipitate and input was reversed using 200 mm NaCl at 65 °C for 5 h. RNase A was added to the samples for 30 min at 37 °C, then incubated 2 h at 45 °C with 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm Tris, pH 6.5, and 50 μg/ml proteinase K. After purifying the DNA by spin column, DNA was amplified by PCR using the primers shown in supplemental Table S3 with the KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Novagen) at a temperature cycle of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 30 s at 68 °C for 30 cycles.RESULTSUp-regulation of Fyn Protein and mRNA in BCR-ABL1-expressing Cells is Dependent on Intracellular ROS Levels-Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated an increase in Fyn expression in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells (14Ban K. Gao Y. Amin H.M. Howard A. Miller C. Lin Q. Leng X. Munsell M. Bar-Eli M. Arlinghaus R.B. Chandra J. Blood. 2008; 111: 2904-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RNA interference-mediated knockdown revealed a role for Fyn in mediating proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Because the BCR-ABL1 oncogene is known to generate ROS (8Sattler M. Verma S. Shrikhande G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24273-24278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and because Fyn is known to be activated by ROS in fibroblasts and hepatocytes (15Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18Sanguinetti A.R. Cao H. Corley Mastick C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between BCR-ABL1 expression, Fyn expression, and its regulation by ROS. In keeping with the oxidant dependence of Fyn described in other cell types (15Abe J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21003-21010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), K562 cells expressing BCR-ABL1 pulsed with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 1 h showed increased Fyn protein expression by ∼1.4-fold as measured by Western blotting and densitometric analysis (Fig. 1A). This short exposure to hydrogen peroxide did not cause cell death as measured by trypan blue positivity (data not shown). To test whether suppressing oxidative stress would suppress Fyn expression, we used the antioxidant, NAC, which is thought to exert its effects by bolstering levels of glutathione (GSH), in K562 and in BaF3 cells transduced with BCR-ABL1 (BaF3 p210). Lysates from these cells were generated in the presence or absence of NAC, and Fyn protein was measured by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Consistent with our previous findings, a 3-fold increase in Fyn protein expression was observed in BaF3 p210 cells as compared with BaF3 vector-transduced cells (lane 2 versus lane 1 of Fig. 1B). In two distinct BCR-ABL1-expressing cells (BaF3 p210 and K562), treatment with 24 mm NAC for 24 h lowered Fyn expression significantly (p = 0.005 and p = 0.01) without lowering expression of actin, which was used as a loading control (lanes 3 and 5, Fig. 1B). To determine if the repression of Fyn expression by NAC would be seen at the mRNA level, quantitative PCR was conducted using Fyn-specific primers (Fig. 1C). Mirroring the protein expression pattern, mRNA of Fyn was increased in BaF3 p210-expressing cells as compared with BaF3 vector-expressing cells and blunted in the presence of NAC (Fig. 1C). A possible explanation reconciling these Fyn mRNA alterations with the rapid changes in Fyn expression induced by hydrogen peroxide suggests that multiple mechanisms may contribute to oxidant-dependent Fyn expression, including transcriptional and post-translational regulation. The same dose of NAC that was utilized in these experiments lowered ROS levels in BaF3 cells transduced with p210 (Fig. 1D) and in K562 cells (Fig. 1E). To verify these results using an alternate measure of peroxide levels, we used an Amplex Red-based assay. Fig. 1F shows that the vector expressing BaF3 cells released ∼0.003 fm hydrogen peroxide/cell/minute, whereas BCR-ABL1-expressing cells released 0.005 fm. Thus, two different assays for cellular peroxide levels confirmed that BCR-ABL1 expression is linked to increased ROS. Taken together, these results suggest that the increased expression of Fyn in BCR-ABL1-expressing cells occurs in an ROS-dependent manner.Characterization of the Human Fyn Promoter Reveals a 200-bp Region Lacking a TATA Box as the Basal Promoter-Despite abundant knowledge of the role of Fyn in signal transduction, no analysis of the Fyn promoter has been conducted to date. Therefore, the factors responsible for Fyn transcription and the molecular mechanism of its mRNA up-regulation in response to ROS are unknown. To elucidate this topic, we cloned the human Fyn promoter region from -2268 to +883 bp and constructed a dual-luciferase expression plasmid containing Renilla luciferase linked to Fyn promoter fragments and firefly luciferase as an internal control (Fig. 2A), thus enabling normalization with values from the same vector. To identify the minimal promoter region required for basal transcriptional activity, a series of deletion constructs (Fig. 2B) were transfected into 293T cells, and dual-luciferase activity was quantitated (Fig. 2, B-F). This initial characterization of the Fyn promoter was carried out in 293T cells, which are easily transfected, because Fyn is ubiquitously expressed across tissue types. Transfection with the longest reporter constructs (-2268/+883) resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in Renilla luciferase activity as compared with SV40 early promoter, demonstrating the robust nature of the Fyn promoter and suggesting that luciferase values from this construct represent a viable control for comparison of other promoter fragments. Constructs lacking the -500 to -1 region had very low luciferase activities, suggesting that the minimal promoter is in this region (Fig. 2B and C). The -200 to -1 construct had the stronges"

PAK activity has been shown to be required for maximal activation of the canonical RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling cascade, possibly because of PAK co-activation of RAF and MEK. Here we have shown that trihydrophobin 1 (TH1), originally identified as a negative regulator of A-RAF kinase, also interacted with PAK1 in cultured cells. Confocal microscopy assay indicated that TH1 colocalized with PAK1 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, which is consistent with our previous results. GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that TH1 interacted directly with PAK1 and bound selectively to the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of PAK1, and the ability of the binding was enhanced along with activation of PAK1. The binding pattern of PAK1 implies that this interaction was mediated in part by PAK1 kinase activity. As indicated by in vitro kinase activity assays and Western blot detections, TH1 inhibited PAK1 kinase activity and negatively regulated MAPK signal transduction. Interestingly, TH1 bound with MEK1/ERK in cells and in vitro without directly suppressing their kinase activity. Furthermore, we observed that TH1 localized to focal adhesions and filopodia in the leading edge of cells, where TH1 reduced cell migration through affecting actin and adhesion dynamics. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which TH1 interacts with PAK1 and specifically restricts the activation of MAPK modules through the upstream region of the MAPK pathway, thereby influencing cell migration.

Members of the PAK family have been implicated in a variety of intracellular signaling events, including cell cytoskeleton rearrangement, proliferation, differentiation, transformation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration (2Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Based on their structures, the PAK family can be grouped into two subfamilies: group A (PAK1-3), which can be activated by small GTPases such as Rac-GTP or Cdc42-GTP binding (2Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar); and group B (PAK4-6), which can interact with Cdc42-GTP but cannot be activated by this binding (2Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 4Jaffer Z.M. Chernoff J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Outside of the kinase- and GTPase-binding domains, group B PAKs are quite different from group A, and their regulation may be distinct (5Dan C. Nath N. Liberto M. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure of PAK1 (6Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), it appears that the inactive state exists as autoinhibited dimers. Upon GTPase binding, PAK1 undergoes a conformational change that separates the autoinhibitory domain from the kinase domain (7Parrini M.C. Lei M. Harrison S.C. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This induces kinase activity and autophosphorylation at several sites, including the Thr-423 site in the activation loop to stabilize the active state (8Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5179-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In resting cells, PAK1 is localized primarily to the membrane structure within the cytoplasm (10Dharmawardhane S. Sanders L.C. Martin S.S. Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); however, activated PAK1 translocates to focal adhesions and membrane ruffles (11Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Overexpression of constitutively activated PAK1 mutants induces dissolution of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions and increases membrane protrusions, cell polarization, and cell motility (12Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

Conversely, in endothelial cells, overexpression of active PAK1 results in decreased cell migration and stabilization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (16Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 831-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These effects are mediated through the action of PAK1 on cytoskeletal regulatory proteins such as LIM kinase (17Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat.

Recent studies indicate that PAK1 activity plays important roles for activation of the MAPK signaling pathways (25Slack-Davis J.K. Eblen S.T. Zecevic M. Boerner S.A. Tarcsafalvi A. Diaz H.B.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2055-2064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism of PAK1 regulation in these pathways is not so clear. The human trihydrophobin 1 (TH1) gene is the homologue of Drosophila TH1, which was originally identified during the positional cloning of mei-41 (28Banga S.S. Yamamoto A.H. Mason J.M. Boyd J.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Hari K.L. Santerre A. Sekelsky J.J. McKim K.S. Boyd J.B. Hawley R.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 815-821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The TH1 gene lies adjacent to mei-41 and was characterized further by Bonthron et al. (30Bonthron D.T. Hayward B.E. Moran V. Strain L. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) in 2000. According to their studies, TH1 is highly conserved from Drosophila to human, as shown by sequence comparison, and is located in chromosome 20q13, which had a transcript product of 2.4 kb. Northern blots showed that TH1 is widely expressed in multiple tissues. The human TH1 protein has been predicted to have a molecular mass of 65.8 kDa and display high levels of expression in cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidney, adrenal, and thyroid. Although highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed, human TH1 is not well understood in terms of its function. Recently, data from our laboratory indicate that TH1, as a new negative regulator of A-RAF kinase in MAPK signal transduction pathways, can specifically bind to A-RAF and inhibit its kinase activity (31Liu W. Shen X. Yang Y. Yin X. Xie J. Yan J. Jiang J. Liu W. Wang H. Sun M. Zheng Y. Gu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10167-10175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TH1 also interacts with human papilloma virus E6-associated protein (E6AP) and induces ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (32Yang Y. Liu W. Zou W. Wang H. Zong H. Jiang J. Wang Y. Gu J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, it is also found to be identical to NELF-C/D, an integral subunit of the human negative transcription elongation factor (NELF) complex (33Narita T. Yamaguchi Y. Yano K. Sugimoto S. Chanarat S. Wada T. Kim D.K. Hasegawa J. Omori M. Inukai N. Endoh M. Yamada T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1863-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although our understanding of the function of TH1 has advanced, little is known about the relationship between TH1 and PAK1. We report here that TH1 interacted with PAK1 in cell and in vitro, and the ability of the binding was enhanced along with the activation of PAK1. TH1 bound selectively to the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of PAK1 and inhibited the ability of PAK1 to phosphorylate substrate, thereby reducing MAPK signal transduction. Finally, our wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay showed that overexpression of TH1 inhibited ERK/MAPK-driven cell migration. This suggests that TH1 specifically restricted the activation of MAPK modules through the upstream of MAPK pathway, thereby influencing cell migration. Cell Culture-293T, HeLa, NIH3T3, and COS-1 cells were obtained from the Institute of Cell Biology Academic Sinica and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2.

TH1 antiserum was raised against GST-TH1 protein purified from Escherichia coli. Other reagents were commercially available in China. Plasmids-Full-length TH1 expression plasmids were constructed as described previously (31Liu W. Shen X. Yang Y. Yin X. Xie J. Yan J. Jiang J. Liu W. Wang H. Sun M. Zheng Y. Gu J. J. Biol.

Chernoff) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the SalI/BamHI site of pEGFP-N3 vector or the SacI/BamHI site of pDsRed-Express-C1 vector (Clontech). AU5-cdc42 and Myc-tagged Rac1 (T17N) were gifts from G. Bokoch. All of the generated sequences and plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Assays-Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 0.5 ml of IP lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm benzamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The whole cell lysates were incubated with control rabbit normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the relevant antibody at 4 °C for 1 h. Pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) were then added, collected by centrifugation after 1 h of incubation, and then gently washed three times with the lysis buffer. The cell lysates containing recombinant protein were incubated with specific antibodies and protein G-agarose beads at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of the relevant antibodies. Then the proteins were detected using the ECL assay kit. GST Pulldown Assay-GST-TH1 was purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). His-tagged PAK1 protein was purified from E. coli using a nickel-Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare). HA-tagged PAK1 and its deletion mutations were expressed in 293T cells for 24 h. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml of IP lysis buffer for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The whole cell lysates were incubated with 10 μl (about 10 μg) of GST-TH1 fusion protein and rotated for 3-5 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 8 min, electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Western blot. An in vitro binding assay was also performed as follow. Namely, purified GST-TH1 and His6-PAK1 proteins were incubated in IP buffer at 4 °C, and then GST pulldown was performed. Kinase Activity Assay-To evaluate PAK1 activity, 293T cells were transfected with various gene plasmids or with vector. After 24 h of incubation in DMEM containing 10% FBS, the cells were serum-starved for 8-20 h and then stimulated with or without 20% FBS for 15 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed at 4 °C in IP lysis buffer. Equal total protein was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-GFP antibody or anti-PAK1 antibody at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and twice in kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm MnCl2). Kinase assays were performed in 30-μl reactions with 25 mm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μg of myelin basic protein. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 8 μl of 5 × sample buffer, boiled, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed using autoradiography. Similar assays were used to measure the activity in immunoprecipitates of MEK1 and ERK from 293T cells. Confocal Microscopy-COS-1 or HeLa cells grown to 50% confluence on coverslips were transiently transfected with GFP or GFP-TH1 along with RFP-PAK1 or RFP-TH1. After 24 h of transfection, cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS, and blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were stained with anti-paxillin antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, stained for F-actin and DNA with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (5 μg/ml) and Hoechst 33258 (50 μg/ml) solution, respectively, in a dark chamber. The coverslips were washed as described above, inverted, mounted on slides, and examined in a Zeiss or Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. RNA Interference-RNA interference was undertaken using the pSilencer2.0 vector (Ambion Inc.). RNA interference target sequences were selected from the human TH1L sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_198976). Target oligonucleotides were synthesized (5′-GATCCGCAGAATTGAGCACACTTTATCGAAATAAAGTGTGCTCAATTCTGCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 3′-GCGTCTTAACTCGTGTGAAATAGCTTTATTTCACACGAGTTAAGACGAAAAAACCTTTTCGA-5′), annealed, and cloned into pSilencer vector between the BamHI and HindIII sites. For shRNA expression, HeLa cells were transfected with non-targeting shRNA vector or vector encoding TH1 shRNA, and 24 h later the cells were treated. Wound Healing Assay and Boyden Chamber Assay-An in vitro wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay were performed as described previously (34Shan D. Chen L. Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Ma X.

After the cells grew to confluency, wounds were made with sterile pipette tips. Wells were rinsed three times with DMEM without serum, and media containing 10% FBS and 100 ng/ml EGF were added. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and photographed. Cell migration assay was performed using Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, 8-μm pores; Transwell®, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) containing polycarbonate membranes. Serum-starved cells were trypsinized and counted. Then 100 μl of 1 ∼ 3 × 106 cells in serum-free medium was added to the upper chamber, and 600 μl of the appropriate medium with 10% FBS or 100 ng/ml EGF was added to the lower chamber. The Transwell was incubated for 12-18 h at 37 °C. Nonmigratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab, and the migratory cells on the undersurface of the membrane were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature. Photographs of three random regions were taken, and the number of cells was counted to calculate the average number of cells that had transmigrated. TH1 Interacts with PAK1 in Cells-Previous studies on the biological function of TH1 and PAK1 in the RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway suggested a functional linkage between TH1 and PAK1 (25Slack-Davis J.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10167-10175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To determine whether the link was physical, the interaction of TH1 and PAK1 was examined. We expressed GFP-tagged PAK1 and HA-tagged TH1 in 293T cells. Although an anti-GFP antibody coimmunoprecipitated HA-TH1 in GFP-PAK1 and HA-TH1 cotransfected cells, this antibody did not coimmunoprecipitate HA-TH1 in control cells cotransfected with HA-TH1 and GFP vector or with HA vector and GFP-PAK1 (Fig. 1A). Conversely, anti-HA antibody also coimmunoprecipitated GFP-PAK1 in GFP-PAK1 and HA-TH1 cotransfected 293T cells (Fig. 1B). Supporting the importance of this interaction, TH1-PAK1 association also took place between endogenous proteins as well as during protein overexpression. Thus immunoprecipitation of endogenous TH1 from HeLa cells resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous PAK1 (Fig. 1C). To further confirm the above results, we examined subcellular localization of TH1 and PAK1 using confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis. We selected COS-1 cells to transfect with pEGFP-TH1 or pEGFP-N3 along with pDsRed-PAK1, respectively. At exactly 24 h after transfection, the cells were fixed and analyzed under confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 1D, in control cells, GFP was distributed in whole cellular compartments, especially in the nucleus, whereas red fluorescent protein-fused PAK1 (RFP-PAK1) was widely distributed in the cytoplasm, and there was no colocalization between GFP and RFP-PAK1. However, in cells coexpressing GFP-TH1 and RFP-PAK1, we observed that the double-transfected cells contained yellow granules, indicating colocalization of TH1 and PAK1 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1D, Normal). Taken together, these data indicate that TH1 interacts with PAK1 in cultured cells. TH1 Interacts Directly with PAK1 in Vitro-To ascertain whether TH1 interacts directly with PAK1, recombinant proteins GST-TH1 and His6-tagged PAK1 were purified from E. coli (Fig. 2A), and an in vitro binding assay was conducted in a cell-free system. The purified recombinant protein His6-PAK1 was incubated with GST-TH1 or GST fusion protein. Glutathione-agarose beads were used to pull down GST or GST-TH1 from the formed complex. Western blots with anti-PAK1 antibody revealed that PAK1 interacted only with GST-TH1 but not GST (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrate that TH1 formed a complex with PAK1 in a cell-free system. TH1 Binding Site Is Located in the Carboxyl-terminal Kinase Domain of PAK1-The regulatory domain of PAK1 spans residues 1-248 of its amino terminus, whereas amino acids 248-545 comprise the kinase domain. The kinase domain of PAK1 is structurally composed of two lobes. The small lobe mainly involves binding to ATP, and the large lobe provides a binding site for peptide substrates (Fig. 2C). A phosphotransfer reaction was achieved by coordination between the two lobes of the kinase domain and their interaction with substrates. To determine where the TH1-binding domain resided on PAK1, we initially engineered constructs encoding aa 1-394, the amino-terminal regulatory region (aa 1-270), and the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (aa 271-545) and expressed them in 293T cells. Then, the whole cell lysates were incubated with E. coli-expressed GST-TH1 or GST fusion protein to perform the in vitro binding assay. As shown in Fig. 2D, a GST pulldown assay showed that TH1 could bind directly with M1 (aa 1-394) and M2 (aa 271-545), whereas no binding with M3 (aa 1-270) was detected. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal 271-545 amino acids of PAK1 were necessary and sufficient for the interaction of TH1. Overexpression of TH1 Inhibits PAK1 Kinase Activity-Because TH1 preferentially associates with the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain of PAK1, we hypothesized that TH1 could influence PAK1 kinase activity. To verify the hypothesis, 293T cells were transiently transfected with GFP-PAK1 WT, GFP-PAK1-K299R (a kinase-dead version of the protein (36Alahari S.K. Reddig P.J. Juliano R.L.

At 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 16 h. The immunoprecipitated PAK1 proteins were tested for kinase activity using myelin basic protein as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 3A, the kinase activity of the active mutant PAK1-T423E was inhibited by TH1, whereas the kinase activity of PAK1 WT disappeared under serum-starved conditions. These data also suggest that TH1 directly affected PAK1 itself to lead to the inhibition of PAK1 kinase activity instead of the blockade of the signaling pathway leading to PAK1 activation. To further study whether the overexpression of TH1 also inhibited the endogenous PAK1 kinase activity in cells, we transfected 293T cells with the active mutant Rac1 (Q61L) and HA-TH1 or vector. Immunoprecipitated endogenous PAK1 proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assays. As seen in Fig. 3B, serum stimulation strongly increased PAK1 kinase activity, whereas overexpression of TH1 blocked the increase in PAK1 activity. Because threonine 423 phosphorylation of the PAK1 is critical for the conformational change of the activation loop, assembly of the active configuration of catalytic domain, and activation of PAK1 (2Bokoch G.M.

As depicted in Fig. 3C, serum stimulation strongly increased the phosphorylation level of PAK1 at site 423, whereas coexpression of HA-TH1 blocked the increase. In summary, these data strongly suggest that TH1 inhibits the activation of PAK1 in cells. TH1 Binds with Active PAK1 Strongly and Interferes with MAPK Signaling-Because of the binding site of TH1 to the kinase domain of PAK1, we reasoned that their interaction might be related to the active state of the PAK1 kinase. To further explore this issue, HA-TH1 was coexpressed with GFP-PAK1-K299R, GFP-PAK1 WT, or GFP-PAK1-T423E. TH1 immunoprecipitated via its HA tag showed enhanced co-precipitation of PAK1-T423E as compared with the wild-type PAK1, whereas in serum-starved cells, co-precipitation of kinase-dead PAK1 was hardly found (Fig. 4A). Notably, coimmunoprecipitation of the wild-type PAK1 dramatically increased from cells cotransfected with the active mutant Cdc42 (Q61L) and stimulated with EGF as compared with that from serum-starved cells (Fig. 4A). Identical results were also obtained with d"

On the other hand, too much or inappropriate fear accounts for many common psychiatric problems. Cumulative evidence suggests that the amygdala plays a central role in the acquisition, storage and expression of fear memory. Here, we developed an inducible striatal neuron ablation system in transgenic mice. The ablation of striatal neurons in the adult brain hardly affected the auditory fear learning under the standard condition in agreement with previous studies. When conditioned with a low-intensity unconditioned stimulus, however, the formation of long-term fear memory but not short-tem memory was impaired in striatal neuron-ablated mice. Consistently, the ablation of striatal neurons 24 h after conditioning with the low-intensity unconditioned stimulus, when the long-term fear memory was formed, diminished the retention of the long-term memory. Our results reveal a novel form of the auditory fear memory depending on striatal neurons at the low-intensity unconditioned stimulus."

The Human Leukocyte Antigen - peptide complex system was divided into four pockets together with their respective peptide fragment and the corresponding occupying amino acid was replaced by each of the remaining 19 amino acids. Partial atomic charges were calculated by a quantum chemistry approach at the Hatree Fock/3-21*G level, to study the behavior of monopole, dipole and quadrupole electrostatic multipolar moments. Two types of electrostatic behavior were distinguished in the pockets' amino acids: “anchoring” located in Pocket 1 and 4, and “recognition” located in Pocket 4 and 7. According to variations in the electrostatic landscape, pockets were ordered as: Pocket 1>Pocket 9≫Pocket 4≈Pocket 7 which is in agreement with the binding ability reported for Class II Major Histocompatibility Complex pockets. In the same way, amino acids occupying the polymorphic positions β13R, β26F, β28D, β9W, β74A, β47F and β57D were shown to be key for this Receptor-Ligand interaction. The results show that the multipolar molecular electrostatic potential approach is appropriate for characterizing receptor-ligand interactions in the MHC–antigenic peptide complex, which could have potential implications for synthetic vaccine design."
