https://openalex.org/W2027062756,"The human species has been altering the environment over large geographic areas since the domestication of fire, plants, and animals. The progression from hunter to farmer to technologist has increased the variety and pace more than the geographic extent of human impact on the environment. A number of regions of the earth have experienced significant climatic changes closely related in time to anthropogenic environmental changes. Plausible physical models suggest a causal connection. The magnitudes of probable anthropogenic global albedo changes over the past millennia (and particularly over the past 25 years) are estimated. The results suggest that humans have made substantial contributions to global climate changes during the past several millennia, and perhaps over the past million years; further such changes are now under way."
https://openalex.org/W1985331098,"Numerical energy balance climate model calculations of the average surface temperature of the Northern Hemisphere for the past 400 years are compared with a new reconstruction of the past climate. Forcing with volcanic dust produces the best simulation, whereas expressing the solar constant as a function of the envelope of the sunspot number gives very poor results."
https://openalex.org/W2082549990,"The serpentine minerals chrysotile, lizardite, and antigorite have been found intimately intergrown with each other and with talc, chlorite, and amphibole in incompletely reacted chain silicates. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy has revealed new variations in serpentine planar and roll structures, as well as regions of mixed-layer silicate consisting of serpentine and talc layers."
https://openalex.org/W1966927433,"A strong correlation exists between the outcrop area of nonmarine rocks deposited during a given geologic period and the observed vascular plant diversity for the same period; however, diversity residuals characteristic of certain periods may have underlying biological causes. Within-flora diversity changes through time indicate that stepwise increases in community species packing have accompanied major tracheophyte evolutionary innovations. Total and within-flora data suggest that the track of North American land-plant diversity has been similar in nature, but not in timing, to that inferred for marine invertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1975967909,"The culture of channel catfish, trout, and crayfish is a well-established, profitable enterprise, but aquaculture provides only a fraction of the protein consumed by Americans, who prefer red meat. This situation could change, since pond-raised fish require less energy for protein synthesis than land animals, the supply of ocean food fish no longer appears inexhaustible, and fish culture can utilize resources unsuitable for other agriculture."

https://openalex.org/W2063652513,Federal abrogation of the age-based mandatory retirement provisions in existing academic tenure contracts calls for a review of tenure and salary policies. Here two alternative explanations for the institution of tenure are examined. Then five alternative policy responses that might be adopted by university administrations are described and analyzed. The proposal favored by the author consists of a two-track salary plan in which a distinction is drawn between tenure and employment.
